Tanking and Survivability Changes<br />
We are making some adjustments to tank survivability based on what we’re seeing in Icecrown Citadel. We feel this is particularly important in preparation for upcoming Heroic attempts. This is tricky and occasionally subjective, so we might very well make more adjustments as we get even more data.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-paladin/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Sacred Duty (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/31849/sacred-duty/) now provides 2 / 4% Stamina, down from 4 / 8% Stamina. The cooldown advantages of the talent remain unchanged.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-death-knight/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Frost Presence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48263/frost-presence/) now provides 8% Stamina, up from 6% Stamina.<br />
Icebound Fortitude (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/48792/icebound-fortitude/) now provides 30% base damage reduction, up from 20% damage reduction. For a geared tank with high defense, this translates to 50% damage reduction, up from 40%.<br />
<br />
It’s important to note that we aren’t trying to single out paladins here. We like the tank balance of warriors and druids at the moment, and we have a larger sample size of warrior tanks that we can compare. Another solution would have been to buff warriors, death knights and druids and then increase boss damage accordingly. Obviously, that would have been a much larger change with greater risks and a longer delay.<br />
<br />
Though Ardent Defender is always a possible target for changes, we like that this talent provides such a distinction between warriors and paladins. Rather than have all the tanks have the same health, armor, avoidance and cooldowns, we’d rather have four unique tanking classes rather than just superficial or artistic differences. Yes, that design is harder to balance, but we think class distinction is ultimately more interesting, which is better for the long term health of the game. The goal remains to have all four tanks be viable for any encounter, assuming sufficient gear and skill, and any differences in performance on individual encounters to be minor. “Minor” is obviously a subjective term.<br />
<br />
Please note that the death knight change will result in a small survivability increase in PvP, which we think is appropriate. We chose it partially with that in mind.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming Blizzard still don't understand the monster that this talent truly is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ardent Defender	Rank 3<br />
Damage that takes you below 35% health is reduced by 20%. In addition, [b]attacks which would otherwise kill you cause you to be healed by up to 30% of your maximum health (amount healed based on defense). This healing effect cannot occur more often than once every 2 min.<br />
<br />
&quot;attacks that would otherwise kill you cause you to be healed by up to...&quot;<br />
&quot;attacks that would otherwise kill you cause you&quot;...<br />
&quot;attacks that Would Otherwise Kill You...&quot;<br />
It could be a 3 day cooldown and it would STILL be stupid to have a talent that basically says &quot;when everyone messes up, you'll still survive, through no effort of your own&quot;. It is the single oh crap button in that game that requires no player interaction, thus no measurable amount of skill, in order to use.<br />
<br />
Screw 'adjusting', this talent should never made it into live.<br />
<br />
... and yes, it doesn't matter that it's &quot;only 1 hit&quot;. It's 1 hit more than it should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is a difference on how you approach a boss that is a pushover where adds die in 2 seconds(Marrowgar), and a boss that is progression(Arthas). Hope you can understand the difference between the two, and understand what my comment on the WoW forums was directed to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tanks are generally your most skilled players, which means we dont come on boards like this one and QQ (like this) endlessly. The result? They don't care if they nerf us because the result is minimal. DPS have no problem trolling trade for &quot;40k hp unbuffed&quot; tanks for whatever reason (I have 36K unbuffed and have tanked ICC10 with no problem at all.) Then, when the tank isn't geared to the teeth everyone is quick to blame them, not stopping to consider that they got all of their i264 gear and the like because nothing dropped for the tank.<br />
<br />
Perfect examples of this: Name one Legendary tank weapon in the game. Or one Legendary Shield (that can be used outside of TK)? Or how about the fact that there are only roughly 6 tanking shields in the entire WOTLK expansion? Or how about the fact that we are the ONLY spec that has no Quel'Dalar? Or that there are only 2 or 3 upgrades for Rimefang? Hey Blizzard, it doesn't really benefit me to have Rimefang's Claw if every tank you see has one (or 2 if they are a DK). Whats the use in that?<br />
<br />
To top it all off, they just took 4% of my stamina. That is about 140 stamina! I would have to get 3 or 4 upgrades (TOC or ICC) in order to account for that much stamina, and then I'd just be earning back what I just lost.<br />
<br />
Give tanks a break Blizzard, we are the hardest working spec in the entire game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A class being crap without a stupidly broken talent is not an excuse to keep the stupidly broken talent. If paladins are truly incapable of tanking encounters without Ardent Defender then the class' tanking system needs completely rethinking. Ardent Defender should be removed because it was stupid to give a talent that directly prevents death to a dps class and it's even more stupid to give it to a tanking class.<br />
<br />
At the most basic level: in the majority of encounters the tank is the character taking the most damage and if the tank dies it's a wipe. This talent directly prevents 1 wipe. Besides the version of Cheat Death available when a level 70 rogue managed to tank both Gruul and Illidan there has never been an ability or talent that did this without any player interaction beyond speccing into it.</div></div><hr />

Thunderfury has been long considered the tank Legendary, as back in Vanilla WoW into BC even the proc made it godly as a tank weapon.<br />

Welcome to tank parity, and being the premier tank class.<br />
<br />
If you re-read what was said, they basically noticed that most of the people going into ICC are using predominantly Pally tanks, and thus they want to steer the population to be more &quot;balanced&quot;. No it wasn't said directly, but if you look at the buff, the nerf, and their remarks, you'll see what i'm saying.<br />
<br />
Balancing classes based on representation sucks, doesn't it.<br />

Omg get over it, IF ardent defender goes off your &quot;most likely&quot; only delaying the inevitable for a few more seconds, I would much rather be able to plan when i wanted that extra health then never being able to move it <br />

Did you also use an alt raid to figure out tactics etc on 25man like Paragon and then went on your main raid? I'm not saying it's wrong or anything, just wondering if it's even possible to be a top raiding guild these days without having tons of alts.</div></div><hr />

Just to clarify here: what about the situations where you're not? The number of wipes that it's only delayed are not important; the number of boss kills that it's enabled are. <br />
<br />
<br />
I would much rather be able to plan when i wanted that extra health then never being able to move it<br />
What you'd rather have doesn't matter. Right now it enables paladin tanks to survive an attack that would kill literally any other class / spec combination in the game (besides rogues specced into cheat death) from nobody's effort beyond you speccing into it. That isn't even remotely balanced.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with ardent defender<br />
&quot;would otherwise kill you&quot; is wrong with ardent defender. If it required 1 player to actually do something besides make mistakes to make ardent defender happen (ideally pushing some kind of key on their keyboard) then it would be perfectly fine. Right now ardent defender prevents 1 wipe that should have happened (no elitism here, the tank should have died and only didn't because of a broken talent). It should have been removed a long time ago, or, ideally, never made it to live servers.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not a case of not being able to tank an encounter its more a case of lack of cooldowns, one of the problems we had in ulduar. Options we had in ulduar were Divine Protection and speccing into Improved Lay On Hands which had a stupid cooldown, where as warriors have shield wall (which lets not forget they can get as low as 1minute cooldown or so if they glyph for it?) + last stand, druid shave last stand (which they can get a 15% bonus on top of with glyphs), barkskin and a decent t10 4 set (which in all fairness they needed) even dks have 2 viable damage reduction cooldowns which is also justified due to not having a shield.<br />
<br />
Paladins on the other hand would simply have Divine Protection if AD was removed putting us very far under other tanks when hardmodes come around and lots of cooldowns are needed to survive, you could argue &quot;people in raid could give you them&quot; but thats besides the point, bottom line is paladins would have 1 cooldown and now less health making them less desirable.<br />
<br />
I've got no problem with the rest of the ardent defender talent remaining or paladins receiving another cooldown button; at least then you'd need to press something. However, an ability or talent that directly prevents death with no player interaction beyond speccing into it is broken no matter how ridiculous they made the cooldown on the effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Long answer: We only started using alts when TOC came out. We also never made it a necessary thing to have as a raider until recently. Our alts were meant to just mix in with mains so we can do 2 of each 25 man so we had double loot for our mains in essence. Looking at some other guilds alts we are very far behind in gear and unfortunately we have ppl playing classes they aren't exactly... &quot;top raiding&quot; guild type of players. <br />
<br />
We did get the first Sindragosa kill on our alt raid with a handful of attempts only, but didn't make it passed P3 in our alt raid on Arthas. <br />

<br />
I'm not asking for paladins to be given last stand. I'm not asking for AD to be turned into a guardian spirit that can only be cast on themselves. I'm asking for the portion of ardent defender that can never be truly balanced to be removed. What blizzard replaces it with is their problem and their decision.<br />
<br />
I'm also not asking for paladins to become warriors or to be made unable to tank. Those are actually 2 things I'd very much like not to happen, but that doesn't give paladin tanks the excuse to have a broken talent. Ideally there should be no broken talents in the game at all.</div></div><hr />

We also never made it a necessary thing to have as a raider until recently. Our alts were meant to just mix in with mains so we can do 2 of each 25 man so we had double loot for our mains in essence. Looking at some other guilds alts we are very far behind in gear and unfortunately we have ppl playing classes they aren't exactly... &quot;top raiding&quot; guild type of players. <br />

We did get the first Sindragosa kill on our alt raid with a handful of attempts only, but didn't make it passed P3 in our alt raid on Arthas. <br />

It is not so much anymore but it is still one of the big ones. It can mean you don't have the gear for the encounter or that a healer messed up (and it can be a 0.1 sec mistake for the healer) but ultimately this is irrelevant. Random tank deaths from unexpected spikes or healer lockdown are part of the raid game. AD removes them from the raidgame. The problem is not the effect itself, it is the fact that it is passive. Noone screams foul for GS because it requires a decision. AD will save you from tank death that was completely unexpected and nothing else can mime this effect. Even on a 10min cooldown it will be OP if it is passive. And I am saying this while having a prot paladin as main. The skill deserves a nerf and we should get an active cooldown to replace it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AetherMcLoud</div><div class="date">2010-02-05, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A class being crap without a stupidly broken talent is not an excuse to keep the stupidly broken talent. If paladins are truly incapable of tanking encounters without Ardent Defender then the class' tanking system needs completely rethinking. Ardent Defender should be removed because it was stupid to give a talent that directly prevents death to a dps class and it's even more stupid to give it to a tanking class.<br />
<br />
At the most basic level: in the majority of encounters the tank is the character taking the most damage and if the tank dies it's a wipe. This talent directly prevents 1 wipe. Besides the version of Cheat Death available when a level 70 rogue managed to tank both Gruul and Illidan there has never been an ability or talent that did this without any player interaction beyond speccing into it.<br />
<br />
<br />
How is Argent Defender any more &quot;broken&quot; than Guardian Spirit?<br />
<br />
Calls upon a guardian spirit to watch over the friendly target. The spirit increases the healing received by the target by 40%, and also prevents the target from dying by sacrificing itself. This sacrifice terminates the effect but heals the target of 50% of their maximum health. Lasts 10 sec.<br />
<br />
Glyphed GS has a 1 minute cooldown as long as it doesn't sacrifice itself, otherwise 3 minutes. It's the best oh shit button priests (or dare I say all healers combined) have. <br />
<br />
And GS is off the GCD so you can cast it whenever you need it instantly. Just like an activated Argent Defender. Oh and before you say &quot;Argent Defender should be an active cooldown&quot; - for it to be a &quot;real&quot; cooldown it would have to have another effect, like the +40% heal from GS. Which would make it better than it already is.<br />
<br />
Argent Defender is certainly awesome, but so is Last Stand, or Vampiric Blood.</div></div><hr />

GS is an active talent. It requires choice and awareness that something wrong may happen in the next 10 seconds. AD does not. This makes a huge difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what do you think, its the paladin class. Most things are passive as it is designed as a class for beginners, stateed by blizzard.<br />
<br />
this talent has to be nerfed. it not funny anymrore seeing pally tanks run around thinking they are god when they dont even need to play to be the best tanks.<br />
<br />
hope that nerf is just the first step, dmg done by them should also be nerfed and ardent defender ofc. <br />
<br />
<br />
idea: Just make ardent defender an active ability and most paladins will be too bad to use it because they just got no skill.</div></div><hr />

Tanking does not take skill depending on out threat rotations. We are not dpsers and we are not talking about heroics. Tanking takes skill in handling encounter mechanics aimed at tanks. And that takes skill whatever your class may be. It's not how well we survive an encounter that makes as skill; this has far more to do with the healers than us.

Ah, but how many times did the extra HP from last stand give that healer the extra .1 seconds and prevent the tank from dying. <br />
<br />
You said earlier that &quot;At the most basic level: in the majority of encounters the tank is the character taking the most damage and if the tank dies it's a wipe. This talent directly prevents 1 wipe.&quot; How is that not true for LS as well.<br />
<br />
Also, LS can be used when you are at half health, or full to save you when you know that youre about to take some big hits. Or on aoe packs to give your healer a break. You are so completely focused on the 1 thing AD does that you are willing to ignore all the other benefits LS offers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But AD doesn't do anything besides preventing the death. GS gives 40% more heal while active, plus it heals for 20% more if the target would have died. So to make AD an active talent it would have to be buffed, probably a whole lot.<br />
<br />
Can you imagine the outcry of warriors and druids if paladins would get such an awesome cooldown? Passive AD is nice. Active AD with +30% maxhealth, +40% heal or whatever the buff would be, would be awesomesauce.</div></div><hr />

No, they didnt. To bug it you had to place the bombs on a very specific part of the platform at a very particular time. Their use of the bugged mechanic was in no way an accident.<br />

I sopose druids warriors shouldnt have last stand/survial instincks for 30% more hp alternatively 30% heal for 20seconds yes i totally understand NERF PALAS HP, NERF PALAS ONLY ABILITY LIKE LAST STAND palas should use cloth instead of plate and palas ar eso OP they require only greys.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pisholina</div><div class="date">2010-02-05, 09:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The thing with Ardent Defender is that, if healer or tankadin screws something up, they can fix it.<br />
Take Ignis the Furnace Master for example. He might take tankadin's healer in the slag pot. What can the tankadin do? He can only use Divine Protection (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=498) and trinket proc's if he has any. Other tanks in the same situation would have more things to do. Warriors can use Shield block (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=2565), Shield Wall (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=871) and Last Stand (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=12975). Death Knight Tanks can use Death Pact (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48743) if they are low on health, Icebound Fortitude (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48792), Vampiric Blood (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=55233) and Rune Tap (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=48982) if you are Blood specced, Unbreakable Armor (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=51271) if you are Frost specced and Bone Shield (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=49222) and Anti-Magic Zone (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=51052) if you are Unholy specced. Now I don't know about Druid tanks because i never played one, but people say they also have some tanking cooldowns. Now Argent Defender works the same way as lets say Last Stand, but instead of giving you 35% max hp, it heals you for 35% hp if you are about to die. If Blizzard removes Ardent Defender, then why would they keep Last Stand, Vampiric Blood and all other major healing spells?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nymrohd</div><div class="date">2010-02-05, 09:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">But AD doesn't do anything besides preventing the death.

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You seem not to get it. The effect itself is not the problem, its passive nature is. And not because it makes paladins easymode, but because it can proc when noone expected tank death. AD in its current form is actually weaker than many other tanking cooldowns because it is just a one-shot save and if the tank was going to tank anyway, AD will just give you a few more seconds to live. Damage mitigation cooldowns can keep a tank alive from massive damage over their entire duration, AD is a one-shot and thus will rarely prolong a fight long enough to get that kill (because the enrage timer be it hard or soft, or stacking debuff was met).<br />
What AD does is remove random tank death. And it happens. Tanks get gibbed all the time because of things noone could control. The boss parry-hasted (hard expertise cap is hard to reach) right when your tank healer got targeted by random AoE and had to move. Any other tank is just dead, there is no reaction time for this. Paladin just ADs.</div></div><hr />

Might be interesting to get some feedback to Blizzard on that, top guilds will have those alt raids making limited attempts somewhat redundent, other guilds won't have making the encounter maybe needlessly difficult for them. There's probably a level of PvE where it serves it's purpose (the top of the guilds that don't have full alt raids, who are forced to more concentration and effort, with only 10-man to experiment things for 25 man) but is it large enough to make the mecanic valuable ?</div></div><hr />

That doesn't matter because the amount of damage doesn't matter with AD. You would have got killed, you won't.<br />
<br />
<br />
You said earlier that &quot;At the most basic level: in the majority of encounters the tank is the character taking the most damage and if the tank dies it's a wipe. This talent directly prevents 1 wipe.&quot; How is that not true for LS as well.<br />
Because LS give you enough health to survive a static amount of damage. AD simply says &quot;you will not die&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, LS can be used when you are at half health, or full to save you when you know that youre about to take some big hits. Or on aoe packs to give your healer a break. You are so completely focused on the 1 thing AD does that you are willing to ignore all the other benefits LS offers.<br />
LS and AD are not the same spell. There are overlaps but they are not identical. I'm fine with this. What I'm not fine with is any talent that directly says &quot;you will not die&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
But AD doesn't do anything besides preventing the death. <br />
Do you realise the impact of what that means? The tank should have died, they didn't, and nobody did anything to make that happen. <br />
<br />
<br />
I sopose druids warriors shouldnt have last stand/survial instincks for 30% more hp alternatively 30% heal for 20seconds yes i totally understand NERF PALAS HP, NERF PALAS ONLY ABILITY LIKE LAST STAND palas should use cloth instead of plate and palas ar eso OP they require only greys.<br />
<br />
Ever tried understading y paladins have this ability? By all mans remove argent but i want warrior druid abilitys taken with it.<br />
AD =/= LS or SI because AD prevents death. LS and SI increase max health for a limited time but it is still possible for a tank to get killed by an attack. AD prevents a tank from dying.<br />
<br />
<br />
The thing with Ardent Defender is that, if healer or tankadin screws something up, they can fix it.<br />
Take Ignis the Furnace Master for example. He might take tankadin's healer in the slag pot. What can the tankadin do? He can only use Divine Protection and trinket proc's if he has any. Other tanks in the same situation would have more things to do. Warriors can use Shield block, Shield Wall and Last Stand. Death Knight Tanks can use Death Pact if they are low on health, Icebound Fortitude, Vampiric Blood and Rune Tap if you are Blood specced, Unbreakable Armor if you are Frost specced and Bone Shield and Anti-Magic Zone if you are Unholy specced. Now I don't know about Druid tanks because i never played one, but people say they also have some tanking cooldowns. Now Argent Defender works the same way as lets say Last Stand, but instead of giving you 35% max hp, it heals you for 35% hp if you are about to die. If Blizzard removes Ardent Defender, then why would they keep Last Stand, Vampiric Blood and all other major healing spells?<br />
If there are issues with paladin tanks then those should be sorted out by the design team. Ardent Defender is not a balanced talent because, as I keep saying, it directly prevents 1 tank death that should have occurred and nobody did anything to make that happen. It only happened &quot;because the tank had this talent&quot;. There was no effort made by healers, dps, other tanks or the paladin themselves. No spells were used, it simply 'happens'.<br />
<br />
<br />
and why should be well geared/skilled tank killed? - only when heal is missing so STFU Smiley And we do not have last stand, removing buble/immunity from enemy players and we have lack of interrupt... and?<br />
Try to come up with a good argument please :) tanks are different, this is fine, being able to survive 1 hit that should have killed you when you did absolutely nothing to stop it is not.<br />
<br />
Reducing the amount of damage taken is fine, but outright preventing it?!?! No. Sorry paladins. You've got a broken talent.</div></div><hr />

this talent has to be nerfed. it not funny anymrore seeing pally tanks run around thinking they are god when they dont even need to play to be the best tanks.<br />
<br />
hope that nerf is just the first step, dmg done by them should also be nerfed and ardent defender ofc. <br />
<br />
<br />
idea: Just make ardent defender an active ability and most paladins will be too bad to use it because they just got no skill.<br />
<br />
<br />
make one tankadin, tank ICC25 with him and then you can start bitching again :) Till that time, stfu boy :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If nearly every guild uses a warrior MT then tanking is fine and guilds just use warriors out of habit.<br />
If guilds start to use any other class as MT then that class must be overpowered and is in need of nerfs.<br />
<br />
There will never be tanking parity between the classes because blizz have as much as said that their metric for seeing if there is anything wrong is watching to see if anyone actually starts to use non-warrior MTs. As long as this flawed reasoning persists then warriors will always be the tank of choice.</div></div><hr />

Disclaimer 1: Tankadin is my main. Note: I have played tankadin before AD was given it's current form. Disclaimer 2: I play my durid tank as much as my palla tank and i have also DK tank that is boring to play (totally personal). But back to da point.<br />
<br />
1. The difference between active talent and passive one is minor - its just a click. Every tank ALREADY have to watch his|her defence CDs, right? Even pallas, y'know? Every tank ALREADY knows that if shit nearly happened it's time to press Oh-that-shit-came-again button, right?

<br />
2. Tank death is just ONE reason for wipe. More important - there is not just one tank involved but 2 or 3. If OTHER tank dies its a most surely wipe too, no matter is it OT or MT (some exceptions may apply on every given fight).<br />
<br />
3. There is relatively large population of players called &quot;I have bad connection and I can't fix it&quot; (think South Africa, some parts of Russia etc).

1. The difference between an active and passive talent is that the passive talent basically has 100% uptime. Yes, a warrior or dk or druid can use a cooldown at an appropriate time and it might save them or it might not. The paladin on the other hand basically has his ability active constantly. It only goes into a cooldown after it saves his life. <br />
<br />
2. Doesn't really make sense, if one tank was much better than others then guilds would just use two of them. <br />
<br />
3. Saying that palas shouldn't be nerfed because they are the only class that can tank when half the healers are offline doesn't exactly seem to help your position. If they can tank for a bad guild with crappy healers it means that they can tank for a good guild who can then take one less healer and one more dps than using any other tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its actually works like this ATM: before it procced there is no difference between tanks. After it's SUDDENLY procced AD is lost and unavailable (and CD is quite huge btw). So no, it's no active constantly. Its only works when it's procs (and it can proc just 2 or 3 times during boss fight). And with good group it's not proccing at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Doesn't really make sense, if one tank was much better than others then guilds would just use two of them. <br />
<br />
Palla is (or was) better not because of AD but because of overly steady combination of passive mitigations combined with healing bonus.<br />

Ofc. pally also has some other advantages, but saying nerf AD because LS is worse is a dumbest thing i ever heard. L2P, and stop whine!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm all for the buff but I wouldn't get too excited. If Blizzard has proven anything it's that they really have NO idea how balance anything short of throwing darts at a chart and nerfing/buffing whatever they hit hoping it will balance SOMETHING SOMEWHERE. So don't be too surprised/upset if this is seen as too much in a month and you end up at 5% buff to stam and 15% armor. Especially when they find out about the, as of now unforseen, buff this gives to DKs in PVP.<br />
<br />
I think buffing other classes to be better tanks in this particular case, to bring them up closer to paladins, might have been appropriate rather than just doing a nerf on a class that has some MINOR (and people can scream all they want it really is minor) advantage. It's not like there aren't DKs, Warriors, Pallys, and Druids all tanking everything in icecrown on all servers anyway. Oh well, on with tanking on my DK, warrior, and pally.(I'd have a druid too but I can't bring myself to level 35 more levels on that toon) <br />
<br />
Good luck everone.</div></div><hr />

You could panic and fire it off when it wasn't needed. You could be a little overconfident and die. The bottom line is, it's a tool that allows you to survive a death IF you use it RIGHT. Decisions like this is what is commonly referred to as &quot;playing a game&quot;.<br />
<br />
AD is automatic. It fires off ONLY if its 100% sure it's absolutely needed, and if it is, it NEVER FAILS. As someone said earlier, it's last stand on autopilot. And you wonder what the big difference is? Playing a FPS with an aimbot is not that big of a deal I guess, it's just aiming with autopilot? Writing a bot that farms for you is fine, it's just farming with autopilot? Having a tank cooldown that decides when to go off by itself is not a big deal, it's just tanking on autopilot!<br />

Paladin is the tank class for special kids, that's all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's make it really simple for you:<br />
<br />
IBF/LS - You have to predict the future to prevent a death with these cooldowns.<br />
AD - You don't have to predict the future.<br />
<br />
Can you see how big a difference that makes?<br />
If you still don't get it, let's make an example:<br />
<br />
We have the world's most skilled Paladin tank and the world's most skilled Warrior tank. So skill is not a problem.<br />
<br />
Warrior tank:<br />
100%, takes a big double hit:<br />
10% hp left (Warrior thinking, oh shi... hits LS) Only LS was available cooldown.<br />
Just at that second, the Warrior got healed to 100% before the next damaging hit. So LS was wasted because healers would save him anyways.<br />
Warrior takes two big hits again, this time healers won't make it in time and Warrior dies from next hit.<br />
<br />
Ok the Paladin tank, same situation:<br />
100%, takes a big double hit:<br />
10% hp left, Paladin have no cooldowns ready and thinks he's about to die.<br />
Just at that second, the Paladin got healed to 100% before the next damaging hit. Nice, he survived.<br />
Paladin takes two big hits again, this time healers won't make it in time and the Paladin takes one more hit. But oh! AD kicks in, saves the Paladin that didn't expect that at all.</div></div><hr />

Yes, cause I (warrior) need to DECIDE &quot;man, time to use last stand or I'll die&quot;, while you (paladin) dont. The game is playing for you. If you dont get it it's cause you're a paladin, and we all know they aren't known for their mental brightness.</div></div><hr />

Lets put it this way. A warrior / DK / Druid has to watch the fight, know whats going on and time his cooldowns correctly to survive.<br />
<br />
A paladin can close his eyes, press 1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2 with his 969 macros the entire fight and his AD automatically kicks in whenever he needs a cooldown. <br />
<br />
The best case scenario for the war / dk / druid is that they use their cooldown correctly and it saves their life. The worst case scenario is that they use it incorrectly and it gives no benefit at all and they die from a random damage spike while the cooldown is not active.<br />
<br />
The worst case scenario for the paladin is that the cooldown kicks in correctly and it saves their life.</div></div><hr />

Believe me, pallas can take AD into account when they plan their next moves. So this sentence clearly shows that you are (a) not playing palla (b) think that pallas are stupid by default. How can ya hope that ya can decide adequately here with such a attitude?</div></div><hr />

Then I'll try to explain it.<br />
<br />
<br />
1. The difference between active talent and passive one is minor - its just a click. Every tank ALREADY have to watch his|her defence CDs, right? Even pallas, y'know? Every tank ALREADY knows that if shit nearly happened it's time to press Oh-that-shit-came-again button, right? I can't see real difference here - pallas are pressing one button while other tanks are pressing 2 (and lots of them macro all their CDs in a single button anyway).<br />
&quot;just one click&quot; is a massive difference. It means you have to:<br />
- choose when to use it<br />
- choose when not to use it<br />
- make sure you don't accidentally using it at the wrong time<br />
None of this currently matters to AD. As someone else said &quot;it will only happen when it's needed, and never fails&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Tank death is just ONE reason for wipe. More important - there is not just one tank involved but 2 or 3. If OTHER tank dies its a most surely wipe too, no matter is it OT or MT (some exceptions may apply on every given fight).<br />
Tank deaths are the primary reason for wipes over the majority of encounters in WoW. Sometimes it can be due to too many other people dying but all those result in the tank not being healed enough (tank death) or the boss enraging and 1-shotting the non-paladin tank (tank death).<br />
<br />
<br />
3. There is relatively large population of players called &quot;I have bad connection and I can't fix it&quot; (think South Africa, some parts of Russia etc). For them having palla tank in guild is basically the only hope not to stupidly wipe on every single spike. Killing current AD will have enormous impact on them. <br />
That is not the fault of the game.<br />
That is not the fault of blizzard.<br />
That is not the fault of anyone else playing WoW.<br />
That is possibly the absolute WORST excuse for AD existing I have ever read.<br />
I lol'd IRL.<br />
<br />
<br />
PPS. TobiasX, mebby ya shelt play more and QQ less?<br />
I already play enough, thanks :) If I'd known about AD sooner I would've been trying to get it changed for longer.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Boy, are you only blind, or something worse? :D<br />
<br />
tank has 10k hp and boss hit for 15k :D<br />
- AD saves you<br />
- last stand gives you more than 10k hp and you survive...<br />
<br />
biig diference :D<br />
<br />
Now, start again, and change that to &quot;boss hit for 40k&quot;...<br />
<br />
Warrior tank: &quot;I'll use Last Stand to give me more health!&quot;<br />
DK tank: &quot;I'll use my 2 minute cooldown and Icebound Fortitude to take less damage!&quot;<br />
Druid tank: &quot;I'll use Survival instinct to give me more health and Barkskin to take less damage!&quot;<br />
Paladin tank: &quot;I'll use my bubble to take less damage!&quot;<br />
Boss: &quot;I'm going to smack you for 10 times your health, but I only get to use this once every 3 days.&quot; :D<br />
Warrior tank: *dies*<br />
DK tank: *dies*<br />
Druid tank: *dies*<br />
Paladin tank: *ardent defender procs* &quot;ROFLMAO!&quot;<br />
Boss: &quot;Oh come on...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
to all the ppl who's complaining about the paladins talents and what evah lets just say...remove all the talents from all classes and we all just do white dmg.<br />
for the casters dps we can do like a mage rotation but with only one spell...with this blizzard can balance all the classes and the &quot;pro's&quot; cant complain about the diference between the class.<br />
TO THE EXTREME!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Seriously there's nothing wrong with most talents. However, giving a guaranteed &quot;I will not die&quot; ability to any class is stupid. It's especially stupid to give it to a class / spec / role that takes large amounts of damage on a regular basis. No, the fact that &quot;it only saves you from 1 hit&quot; is not an excuse. It's 1 hit too many for an ability of this magnitude.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's make it really simple for you:<br />
<br />
IBF/LS - You have to predict the future to prevent a death with these cooldowns.<br />
AD - You don't have to predict the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
AD is not like other CD's. But what's the point of doing such comparisions? AD sometimes makes life easier, sometimes makes life harder. Problem is, when AD procs, because of healers fault, you are fucked if you fight with boss which requires perfect CD timing. I remember how much troubles we had on Algalon with AD. AD can save your ass, but you can't use it so smart as warrior can. <br />
<br />
<br />
AD - You don't have to predict the future.<br />
Yes and No. Tank don't have to predict the future. But healers instead MUST. They need to consider, that pally has one CD he can fire at trouble, and one which is fired automaticly.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kriziak</div><div class="date">2010-02-05, 12:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lets put it this way. A warrior / DK / Druid has to watch the fight, know whats going on and time his cooldowns correctly to survive.<br />
<br />
A paladin can close his eyes, press 1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2-1-2 with his 969 macros the entire fight and his AD automatically kicks in whenever he needs a cooldown. <br />
<br />
The best case scenario for the war / dk / druid is that they use their cooldown correctly and it saves their life. The worst case scenario is that they use it incorrectly and it gives no benefit at all and they die from a random damage spike while the cooldown is not active.<br />
<br />
The worst case scenario for the paladin is that the cooldown kicks in correctly and it saves their life. <br />
<br />
<br />
what is better - one heal to 35% at 0 health or 30% increased health for 20 seconds? Thats the diference between AD and LS.</div></div><hr />

Narrowing it down to one boss (Vezax two?) isn't that great to justify the talent.<br />
Compare it to how many other bosses (ICC is most important today) that AD is way better than LS/IBF.<br />

Well tanks don't have to, but for their cooldowns to be as effective as AD, they need to predict the future. Many people say that AD and LS have no difference.<br />

Activating it is not a downside. As stated before you can use last stand and it have no effect, for example, you get a large holy light right as you hit it, and thus would have survived the hit anyway, now you lost your CD. AD can not be accidentally used, it works every time, because like you said, you have to die for it to work, so if it didn't, you would be dead... Another good example of this is Koralon, the fire boss in vault. When an off-tank dies and there's a pally main tank, often times they are able to live through even a high stack of damage buffs, other tanks simply get 2 shot. I have seen this happen so many times! Also AD makes paladins ridiculous heroic mode tanks because of the hard hits and need of effective health..</div></div><hr />

Stop comparing a class' full book of skills. You make it sound like Paladins have no skills other than AD. Now you're just making stupid arguments.<br />
<br />
Do note that pre-fix, Paladins were excelling in every area (survivability, threat, health).<br />
And the only thing that got nerfed is health, which is not going to make a Paladin tank worse.<br />
<br />
Only inexperienced fools believe that the extra health that Paladins had was what made them the superior tank.</div></div><hr />

AD is not an ability for when you die, it's an ability for saving you when you would otherwise die.

just dont forget it isnt 20 sec like LS. Its just one hit. If healers are AFK and you have 1k hp - then if boss does hit you for 2k and 25k, you are death even so :)</div></div><hr />

If healers are AFK and you pulled, you're a bad tank for not checking first :)<br />

I'd still trade any of the abilities I mentioned for something that says &quot;I can take 1 hit that would kill me and I won't die from it, guaranteed&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't mind discussing what kind would need to be given to paladin tanks to replace this but the most important thing, to me, is that AD (and Cheat Death, I haven't forgotten about rogues either) are both broken talents and need removing. Again (hopefully for the last time): No class should have an ability that guarantees they will not die and they don't need to even push a button to use.</div></div><hr />

The problem is, as many people have noticed - all other LS effects can be wasted while it is impossible to waste AD and it stops you from dying.<br />
<br />
If your healer is 0.1 seconds too late hitting cast and you take a big hit - Paladin would survive, possibly down the boss after. All other tanks die, and you can't exactly replace your tank mid-fight unless you have someone as a spare standing around.<br />
<br />
The crux of all fights rely on three things - the tanks don't die, the DPS is sufficient and the healers don't die. If any of them three things fail, you will tend to find your raid fails that encounter. The problem with AD is that it makes Paladin tanks less likely to die and wipe the raid - and considering the tank takes the most amount of damage, this is a good thing for any raid. <br />
<br />
As a DK tank, I found I almost always played second fiddle to our Paladin tank because this talent helped for the times our healers slacked. Coupled with the threat output of a Paladin, it was ideal for the Paladin to MT. I didn't particularly mind, but I would prefer that an active decision to use AD was needed.<br />
<br />
If I had to decide, I would let Paladins keep their AD, but make it so that it doesn't prevent death. You would have to cast AD on yourself, which would cause a 10 second buff which would give you 30% of your health upon taking a hit which should kill you, and if the damage cuts through that 30% too, then you die. If you don't use your AD, then it has a 20 second cooldown, otherwise, the cooldown is what it should be.</div></div><hr />

Festergut?<br />
Equal geared Paladins could faceroll Inhale-3 on Festergut-25 without any cooldowns. Healers had more problems keeping a Warriors up that were spamming all cooldowns.<br />
And Paladins can use Bubble and have the highest mitigation of all the tanks.<br />

Honestly mon, ya shelt play palla at least abit. Durid set of CDs &gt; palla set. Since DK set was buffed its too &gt; palla set. As far as i can tell (don't have direct exp warrior tanking) warrior CDs are at least as good as palla set.<br />
<br />
Dunno why but you totally ignoring the fact that single CDs are not really important for class comparison. Sets are. Yes AD is good, although less good dan ya imply. But Divine Protection is just Ok, not Okok. And both are messing with wings, with bubble, with HoP which is imba unhandy in really demanding situations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You left out the constant ~7% increase in EH you also get from AD. <br />
<br />
The problem for prot palas (and to a lesser extent DK tanks) is that they are pretty easy classes to play. The rotations are fixed and simple, the cooldowns are plentiful or passive and the classes are very friendly to new players. The downside you get with simple but effective tools is that without a high barrier to entry there has to be a lower upper limit to effectiveness. Thats why a poor paladin tank is far better than a poor warrior tank, an average paladin is far better than an average warrior but soon past that you start to hit the skill cap for paladin tanking. <br />
<br />
A warrior who times his cooldowns to perfection is better than any paladin tank can be. That may only be the top 2% or 10% whatever of warriors but the difference is they have to play really well. And this of course is why blizzard are quite happy to see the top guilds using warrior tanks but jump in with the nerf bat as soon as they start using paladins or DKs. The perception is that a warrior does well if he plays well but a paladin or DK does well because the class is easy to play. This is a hard problem to fix and the only eventual solution will come from the dumbing down of the warrior class to the point where the skill cap for warriors is just as low as it is for paladins and DKs. <br />

The paladin tank is basically a warrior tank with everything made easy. You forget to keep up thunderclap and demorilizing shout? Don't worry, its passive for a paladin. You have trouble watching and using procs for shield slam and revenge? Don't worry, all paladin abilities are on fixed timers with no procs to look for and an easy rotation to follow. You have trouble keeping up your shouts during the boss encounter? Don't worry, your buffs all last 30 minutes and only need to be cast once before the fight starts as a paladin. You have trouble keeping aggro on multiple mobs? Don't worry, AoE threat is high and easy as a paladin. You have trouble using your cooldowns correctly? Don't worry, we will give you one that is powerful and always procs exactly when you need it. Have trouble managing your rage? Don't worry, your blue rage bar starts at full and stays that way for the entire boss fight. You might argue that none of those things are hard but the simple truth is that all of those things are pretty much automated for a paladin tank.<br />
<br />
Therein lies the rub though, I don't think I have ever tanked a fight on my warrior where I felt I did everything perfectly. There is always some small place I could improve, I miss a heroic strike or use one too many and go low on rage, or devastate when I should have used a shield slam proc, or some other small thing I should do better. On the other hand, I have often tanked fights as a Paladin where I felt there was literally nothing I could improve on. You keep up a simple rotation, you have only one cooldown to watch, time that right and bam, perfect fight. From a balance perspective however this presents a problem. Since warrior tanking is an imperfect someone in blizzard has to decide that, well, if they get 90% of things right the warrior should be as good as the paladin otherwise they cant compete, or maybe they say 80% right or whatever. The issue then is that the outliers will end up being better than the paladin can hope to be. Blizzard are happy with that and comfortable with it. Anytime the top paladins (or DKs) are doing as well as the top warriors Blizz will nerf those classes because the easy option isn't supposed to perform as well as the hard one.<br />
<br />
So what does this mean for Pala and DK tanks? Well if you are in a typical casual or semi-hardcore guild it doesn't matter. Odds are the warriors you are playing with are good but not exceptional, you will do just as well as they will and everyone will be happy. If you hope to be in tanking in the true top-end guilds though, it just won't happen. At that level you are competing with the very best and the best just do better at classes with the higher skill cap.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dunno why but you totally ignoring the fact that single CDs are not really important for class comparison. Sets are. Yes AD is good, although less good dan ya imply. But Divine Protection is just Ok, not Okok. And both are messing with wings, with bubble, with HoP which is imba unhandy in really demanding situations.<br />

<br />
if u dont understand my last post... let me tell u this<br />
classes exist to be diferent with diferent game play if they do the same things on a warrior on a paladin or druid or dk WTH u role paladin or a warrior or what ever?!<br />
<br />
its obvious ppl who one specific class thinks other is more OP<br />
<br />
<br />
just to finish i've roled a tankadin and a prot warrior and guess what i prefer the warrior 34k warrior with a lvl 75 nab shield instead the 40k unbuffed paladin cuz it is way better...and the only situation i prefer the pala is when a do a random hc and i've to tank HoR in there paladin is a bit better cuz i can silence the mages with avenger shield</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A class being crap without a stupidly broken talent is not an excuse to keep the stupidly broken talent. If paladins are truly incapable of tanking encounters without Ardent Defender then the class' tanking system needs completely rethinking. Ardent Defender should be removed because it was stupid to give a talent that directly prevents death to a dps class and it's even more stupid to give it to a tanking class.<br />
<br />
I like that Ardent Defender has proc'd more often in attempts that are already wipes than it has saved me in a still viable attempt. In other words, &quot;okay, I'm finally dying so we can get back in here and try it again...&quot; *woosh* &quot;okay, wait for another 15k hp...&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mages need more HP.<br />
<br />
Yes they do :-\<br />
<br />
I assume Warlocks were originally designed to have more stamina to support Life Tap and mages were expected to use silly things like Mana Shield to make up for their glass cannon status. We know how well the old vanilla concepts have worked out (err been stamped out) during WotLK.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1: AD can still be leapfrogged. Large enough hits at low enough hp will still kill the paladin.<br />
2: Sure, paladins can bubble. But while we're bubbled, the DPS is being one-shotted. Or did you forget the whole bit where it removes the paladin from the threat table while the bubble is active?<br />
<br />
Paladins have been balanced AROUND AD, if we didn't have that cooldown we'd need MORE hp or other abilities to compensate.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kriziak</div><div class="date">2010-02-05, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If healers are AFK and you pulled, you're a bad tank for not checking first :)<br />
<br />
I'd still trade any of the abilities I mentioned for something that says &quot;I can take 1 hit that would kill me and I won't die from it, guaranteed&quot;.<br />
<br />
I don't mind discussing what kind would need to be given to paladin tanks to replace this but the most important thing, to me, is that AD (and Cheat Death, I haven't forgotten about rogues either) are both broken talents and need removing. Again (hopefully for the last time): No class should have an ability that guarantees they will not die and they don't need to even push a button to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
naah, AFK healers was a joke - sometimes it happens that am on 10k hp for few seconds and no heal is comming :D Then i press divine protection or LoH just to get big heal in next second :)<br />
<br />
Its not only about you use LS just to be healed and you have used it for nothing - because you have big HP for <br />
20 seconds, not just for that one second. Healers can easier heal you over all spikes in next 20 seconds...<br />
<br />
Another diference between AD and LS is, that on most fights isnt AD popping. It will not pop if ppl are doing what they should. But you can use LS just to make life easy for healers every 3 min or 2 min glyphed if you want to. You dont need to push it if you are on low HP, you can push it while on full HP just before spike - like on Marrowgar or Koralon if OT is away instead stacking on you - and you have BIG HP for 20 seconds - on Marrowgar you can go trough more dmg spikes with LS then just with AD - one hit and 2 min cd.<br />
<br />
AD isnt OP. Sometimes is better, sometimes worse - in avg. the same. <br />
<br />
(about tank stacking on Marrowgar - in 10 man it happen ones, that noob tank goes afk during boss fight, so i needed every time to pick up marrowgar and run to that AFK tank to split spikes :-D )</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem for prot palas (and to a lesser extent DK tanks) is that they are pretty easy classes to play. The rotations are fixed and simple, the cooldowns are plentiful or passive and the classes are very friendly to new players. The downside you get with simple but effective tools is that without a high barrier to entry there has to be a lower upper limit to effectiveness. Thats why a poor paladin tank is far better than a poor warrior tank, an average paladin is far better than an average warrior but soon past that you start to hit the skill cap for paladin tanking. <br />
<br />
A warrior who times his cooldowns to perfection is better than any paladin tank can be. That may only be the top 2% or 10% whatever of warriors but the difference is they have to play really well. And this of course is why blizzard are quite happy to see the top guilds using warrior tanks but jump in with the nerf bat as soon as they start using paladins or DKs. The perception is that a warrior does well if he plays well but a paladin or DK does well because the class is easy to play. This is a hard problem to fix and the only eventual solution will come from the dumbing down of the warrior class to the point where the skill cap for warriors is just as low as it is for paladins and DKs. <br />

When everyone have same abilities, you QQ that the game is boring. When one class have somethign special, you QQ that it should be nerfed/removed/give to other classes too... Wake up, grow up.<br />
You clearly dont see that all tanking classes have some panic buttons. Can you show me other tanking class, who has CD on one of their &quot;panic button&quot; after using another one? Like palas after using DP cannt use LoH another 2mins. You can use LS, you can use SW as warrior, both at same time or close after each other if need. Palas cannt. So there is AD. Sure, you shouldnt need to use LS and SW after each other, same with LoH/DP/AD if healers do things good. But thats why those buttons are in game, to be ready if something goes wrong. AD is not OP in any way. The HP gain is based on your def (so in PvP its useles as you get healed for few HP and die in no sec after) and its just actual heal, just for the sec. So if healers arent fast enough, you die anyway. LS gives you more HP for kinda long enough time to help healers out. So, its two similar abilties but still so diferent. Both have advantages and disadvantages. <br />
Its normal, its game and seriously if you cannt go over it that someone has ability which you dont have, you play wrong game. Go back to anything bored you played before and stay with it please. Because if Blizzards should listen ppl like you, than the game would end with 9classes, everyone with same abilities and you just chose color of your icon..</div></div><hr />

b) hand of protection = 100% physical dmg reduction, you loose agro<br />
c) divine protection = 50% dmg reduction = shiled wall, no loosing of agro<br />

<br />
Now if I am on 10k hp and heal is slacking, i need to choose, if I use Divine protection - and i get more 50% reduction till some heal will come or if I use LoH to get to full hp without possibility to use DI in two minutes...</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Its easy to play pala tank. Its harder to play him at cap :-)<br />
- With mana its good in raids, harder in heroics or if soloing/questing.<br />
- Pala has good aoe, but not good enough if every dps is nuking other target :-D<br />
- the only harder thing with warriors is stance dancing, like you need to get to berserk stance for pummel and back to defense stance - its more clicking. And then we have macros :-)<br />
- blizzard didnt wrote on creating character screen - if you are beginner get palla, if you wanna be good tank, get warrior. I choosed paladin because RP :-) <br />
- how many prot and retri paladins have 'cleanse' in action bar, how many of them use it?<br />
- how many paladins put BOP on someone who need it?<br />
- how many paladins use LoH on someone who need it after someone took big direct dmg or aoe and is near to die?<br />
- how many paladins use Hammer of justice to interrupt boss spelcasting (valkiers in toc) if there isnt interrupt class like rogue or is interruper dead or just noob?<br />
- many times its easy to play with war, because he can interrupt every 10 sec, shield bash, disarm, harmstring, shockweave - pala doesnt have them - its because that to play with pala easy? because he lack these usefull abilities?</div></div><hr />

<br />
DK buff is deserved in my opinion, DK tanks should stay in competition with palas/warr. <br />
Druid tanks need a small buff.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why you people keep on blabbing about AD, how &quot;overpowered&quot; it is. Not like it has any direct influence upon choosing your Main tank for ICC or in PVP. <br />
<br />
Thing why paladin threat is so &quot;good&quot; now is because ICC is undead/demon based, and paladins should have increased TPS/DPS on that type of mobs anyways.<br />
Any sane person would welcome a buff to a tanking class because it helps you to conquer some instance and progress more, i don't get it why you would like to nerf paladins if its actually better for the raid to buff them even more (you get more epics which are too easy to get anyways). Wow is a team game, too many players lost that perspective.</div></div><hr />

<br />
99% of the time the only time AD goes off is when I am not getting healed as the healers are dead and we wipe 10 seconds after my AD procs and I die again shortly after. in the few chances that it saves me and we are able to keep going (healers miss a heal or lag or whatever) I usualy can see the need for it coming. If i am under 30% hp for any amount of time and no heals are coming in, any tank, of any class is going to be looking for a oh crap button. Just make AD a button and end the crying.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2010-02-05, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading all the QQ about AD talent and dont know what to think about you guys... 6years, 7years old? When everyone have same abilities, you QQ that the game is boring. When one class have somethign special, you QQ that it should be nerfed/removed/give to other classes too... Wake up, grow up.<br />
I'm not arguing that all classes should be the same, I like that classes are different. What I don't like is abilities that outright prevent death when the player did absolutely nothing for it (beyond speccing into a particular talent). No class, tank, dps or healer, should be able to do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
You clearly dont see that all tanking classes have some panic buttons. Can you show me other tanking class, who has CD on one of their &quot;panic button&quot; after using another one? Like palas after using DP cannt use LoH another 2mins. You can use LS, you can use SW as warrior, both at same time or close after each other if need. Palas cannt. So there is AD. <br />
That isn't a good enough excuse for AD, sorry. Being about to prevent death without trying should be impossible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sure, you shouldnt need to use LS and SW after each other, same with LoH/DP/AD if healers do things good. But thats why those buttons are in game, to be ready if something goes wrong. AD is not OP in any way. The HP gain is based on your def (so in PvP its useles as you get healed for few HP and die in no sec after) and its just actual heal, just for the sec. <br />
You don't understand the issue with AD. It could reduce you to 1 health and it would still be broken because it prevented a hit that should have killed you and you did nothing to make it happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if healers arent fast enough, you die anyway. LS gives you more HP for kinda long enough time to help healers out. So, its two similar abilties but still so diferent. Both have advantages and disadvantages. <br />
This is all true, but it doesn't mean AD is balanced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its normal, its game and seriously if you cannt go over it that someone has ability which you dont have, you play wrong game. Go back to anything bored you played before and stay with it please. Because if Blizzards should listen ppl like you, than the game would end with 9classes, everyone with same abilities and you just chose color of your icon.. <br />
I don't want every class to be the same. I don't want everyone playing the same class. However, that doesn't mean it's fine for broken abilities to remain as they are. Ardent Defender passively allows a paladin tank to survive a hit that would kill any other character in the game besides a subtlety rogue. This should not be allowed to happen, it's a broken talent and it needs to be changed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I like how the entirity of this post is people complaining about how a talent that's basically an easy mode Last Stand is so gamebreaking.<br />
<br />
Maybe try and focus on the fact you can level to 80 in 3 days, have full 232/245 in 2 more days, then faceroll icc10 and 80% of icc25 whilst pressing 5 buttons.<br />
Those are all issues for another day (and another thread) and, lets be honest here, it's a little more powerful than &quot;an easy mode Last Stand&quot;. ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Offhand</div><div class="date">2010-02-05, 03:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem for prot palas (and to a lesser extent DK tanks) is that they are pretty easy classes to play. The rotations are fixed and simple, the cooldowns are plentiful or passive and the classes are very friendly to new players. The downside you get with simple but effective tools is that without a high barrier to entry there has to be a lower upper limit to effectiveness. Thats why a poor paladin tank is far better than a poor warrior tank, an average paladin is far better than an average warrior but soon past that you start to hit the skill cap for paladin tanking. <br />

I suppose that's why Vodka and Paragon both ran paladin tanks. I've yet to see or hear about this mystical prot warrior skillspec from anyone other then butthurt warriors on forums.</div></div><hr />

Every heal you get on low HP prevents you from death. Blizz should change it, its gamebreaking. At any heal you get if under 30% of HP a messagebox should pop-up asking, if you agree with that incoming heal or not. Else it would preventing your death without needed to click - you dont need a skill to stay alive, if you are healed and you dont need to click that you agree with incoming one heal, or maybe more heals in 10 seconds - so it will be not too much messageboxes on your screen what would need much bigger skill.</div></div><hr />

I personally don't think AD is OP, though quite strong. That being said, if Blizzard thinks AD is OP, they should infact nerf AD, I see no reason pallies should loose 4% stamina due to that.<br />
<br />
AD is paladins Last Stand/Survival Instinct/Bone Shield(etc). Again it is strong, but I'd argue so are the other CDs, just the other CDs are more of a &quot;We're struggling 1 healer just died, you need to survive a bit whilst the druid BRes&quot; whilst AD is more &quot;Okay our holy paladin had to move and you got bursted down&quot;. Which is stronger I'd argue depends on the situation.<br />
<br />
4% hp on the other hand, I'm wondering why that was needed? We're on-par with atleast Warriors on health, both have a lot of versitility(paladins more defensively whilst warriors more offensively). -20% below 35% is basicly what you have to take into account vs warriors. Warriors have abilities though such as shield block which imo weight enough against this(as -20% is only ~4k hp), but one can argue around that.<br />
<br />
TLDR: I personally don't think this nerf was warranted, if there's something wrong with an ability fix or change that ability, not make the class around the ability.</div></div><hr />

What? It's not harder to play the best at any class than just pressing buttons mindlessly?<br />
<br />
- With mana its good in raids, harder in heroics or if soloing/questing.<br />
Heh... it's not hard, learn to chain pull. 15seconds is more than enough time to get to the next pull.<br />
<br />
- Pala has good aoe, but not good enough if every dps is nuking other target :-D<br />
Paladins have the best aoe tanking abilities along with DKs.<br />
<br />
- the only harder thing with warriors is stance dancing, like you need to get to berserk stance for pummel and back to defense stance - its more clicking. And then we have macros :-)<br />
You obviously don't play a Warrior, as I play both prot pally/warrior and druid.<br />
<br />
- blizzard didnt wrote on creating character screen - if you are beginner get palla, if you wanna be good tank, get warrior. I choosed paladin because RP :-) <br />
That's great.....<br />
<br />
- how many prot and retri paladins have 'cleanse' in action bar, how many of them use it?<br />
I don't know of any decent paladins that don't have it on their bar, they shouldn't be playing a paladin if they don't. I've seen all the decent ones cast it on themselves to get out of a root.<br />
<br />
- how many paladins put BOP on someone who need it?<br />
If you're playing at your so called &quot;cap&quot; this shouldn't be required. Righteous defense has always sufficed.<br />
<br />
- how many paladins use LoH on someone who need it after someone took big direct dmg or aoe and is near to die?<br />
AoE? Healers job. Direct damage? You weren't doing your job in the first place, you should use that GCD to taunt rather than waste that spell.<br />
<br />
- how many paladins use Hammer of justice to interrupt boss spelcasting (valkiers in toc) if there isnt interrupt class like rogue or is interruper dead or just noob?<br />
You don't get around much.<br />
<br />
- many times its easy to play with war, because he can interrupt every 10 sec, shield bash, disarm, harmstring, shockweave - pala doesnt have them - its because that to play with pala easy? because he lack these usefull abilities?<br />
Warriors are the base tank, all the other tanks have some element from Warriors that are in some case better.<br />
Shockwave - Holy Wrath and in all directions. Yes it's only undead but Northrend is heavy in those, especially ICC.<br />
Shield Bash - DK's have their version<br />
Hamstring - Why would a warrior use that while tanking? You guys have Avenger's Shield if there's some reason a slow is needed.<br />
Disarm - How often can that be used on bosses or any important fight?<br />
<br />
Half of those things you mentioned explain how Paladins can be superior. I'll just make a small list to add on.<br />
<br />
<br />
-Paladins have Righteous Hammer, a vastly superior spell compared to any tanking class when it comes to heroics. <br />
-Avenger's Shield siliences and shorter cooldown than Heroic throw, so it's easier to gather up caster mobs up as a Paladin.<br />
-Consecration, a near constant aoe damage if used every time the cooldown is up. Druid are the only one close to matching that with swipe but don't generate the same aoe threat a paladin can. Don't reason with tier pieces.<br />
-Judgements, the raid gets a nice benefit from either the health or mana one.<br />
-Superior buffing, there can be superior buffs to Warrior shouts.<br />
-Extremely easy to achieve 100% better mitigation because Paladins can have 100% chance to block if they don't evade it because of Holy Shield.<br />
-No worries of rage, mana can be easily kept up as I have stated.<br />
-Bubbles, Salvation, helps if the person manages to over aggro. Of course I'm accounting if you're not the tank.<br />
-There's probably more.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigben85</div><div class="date">2010-02-05, 04:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ardent Defender - Attacks that would otherwise kill you cause you to be healed by up to 30% of your maximum health. Will proc when the pally is low on health <br />
<br />
Last Stand - When activated, this ability temporarily grants you 30% of your maximum health for 20 sec allowing you to survive an attack that would otherwise kill you. Will be activated by any smart warrior when low on health.<br />
<br />
Whats the difference again? Cause I honestly cant find it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, I am a warrior tank. I consider my self pretty experienced having tanked most encounters of wotlk (still room to improve, as always). But consider this, Last Stand doesn't always save me. Sometimes I die before I can press it. Yes, I died before I can press it. In ICC, there's at least 3 times when I pressed last stand and then shield wall but I died before they became activated. This could be due to unpredictable huge hits (Festergut, or even Morrowgar) that I just can't act fast enough to for those few times where I died. It could also due to lag (or DC for others) that we fail to have Last Stand activated at the moment when we need it. Warrior tanks take spiky damage, we can't always have 3 seconds to know when we will take 2 hits in a row and die. Also, there are healers who have lag issues, that makes it even harder to know when to use my cooldowns as I don't know when they lag out bad. For paladin tanks, you don't NOT have to worry about all the above as much as I do as you will always have 1 &quot;cooldown&quot; that can save you from dying if all else you do fails from saving you. If anything, AD and Last Stand should swap their places, not because I like taking it easy as a tank but because it makes no sense to have an easy OP tank class to have even a better survival tool that requires no interaction from the player as others have stated.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what to make of the second point. If you're saying AD is bad because retadins can spec it then you don't know it won't proc unless you have more than base defense, i.e. you have to gear for defense for it to actually heal for anything. If you're calling Paladins a DPS class then, basically, fuck you.<br />
<br />
As for the first point it couldn't be farther from the truth. Typically when it procs its more like a swan's song than a savior. I have had AD save a raid, but it is VERY rare. If AD procs something is wrong and the next hit you don't avoid is probably going to kill you. Most of the time something is VERY wrong. For me it typically doesn't proc until half the raid is dead. So what was saved then? Another couple seconds. Unless the boss is at 1% a wipe is imminent AD or not.<br />
<br />
If Pallys are going to have AD, which is basically 30% extra health, then a stam nerf is probably justified. I personally think its an interesting feature and something unique that Protadins bring to a raid. I've got 31K armor and a heap of avoidance, I'm not too worried about it.<br />
<br />
Someone else said that Pally tank cooldowns are plentiful. This may once have been true, but not now that LoH causes forbearance. You may have three to choose from but you only get to use one every two minutes. DK tanks have plentiful cooldowns.

I think you're misunderstood what I was saying. I said it was a stupid talent for a dps class to have (the dps version is a rogue talent called Cheat Death, it also reads &quot;when you would die, instead...&quot; or words to that effect). Of course prot paladins are not a dps class.<br />

It stops you from being dead when you should have been no matter how much damage you take. Sorry, but that's broken.<br />

It's more than just unique feature of prot paladins and for that 1 hit is miles more powerful than any other spell, ability or talent in the game besides Cheat Death.<br />

DKs have a lot of cooldown. That doesn't mean paladins should be allowed to keep AD in its current form.<br />

<br />
Noobs like you think its an i-win button when its not. Its a progression tool. Why? Because anything that hits hard enough to KILL THE TANK with one swing in a raid WILL PROBABLY END UP KILLING HIM WITH THE SECOND OR THIRD SWING!!!<br />
<br />
All this tool does is delay a wipe. When AD goes off, the shit is already inside the fan blades. AD has NEVER gone off during an encounter and we ended up killing the boss; and our guild is a server top 10.<br />
<br />
All this tool does is allow the raid to see a couple more seconds of the encounter while you are still learning the fight as a guild. However if your tank healer(s) fell asleep at the keyboard or experienced lag, then yes, it buys you some time, but I have never personally seen this happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
- First, i am not cap, but i try play good as I can :-) Far from cap yet :-)<br />
- AoE tanking - warriors have quite nice thunderclap and taunt all ability (challenging shout), but yes, we have good AoE. I only say that it isnt allmighty :) <br />
- &quot;decent paladins that don't have it on their bar&quot;, yeah decent. Not noobs :)<br />
- &quot;Direct damage? You weren't doing your job in the first place&quot; - you mean like chain lighting on Emalon or frostbolt on Lady Deathwhisper or similar is my job? :-)<br />
- &quot;AoE? Healers job&quot; - right, but sometimes it can be too much for them :) Shit happens.<br />
- Faction Champions - I use taunt always if I can. If are all taunts on CD and stun too, or if mob is immune because of DR, then I BoP the leather or cloth wearer who is attacked. BoP can be used too in ToC on Gormok for debufing or Anubarak p2.<br />
- &quot;Holy Wrath and in all directions. Yes it's only undead but Northrend is heavy in those, especially ICC.&quot; - ICC isnt the only raid what appeared in WoTLK. And cant be used in PVP in example :)<br />
- &quot;Hamstring - Why would a warrior use that while tanking? You guys have Avenger's Shield if there's some reason a slow is needed.&quot; - thats of PVP ofc not tanking, just out of tanking theme - only diferencies between warriors and pala buttons :)<br />
- &quot;Disarm - How often can that be used on bosses or any important fight?&quot; - only Gormok normal mode I think. Else just umiportant trash, but you can lower dmg incoming.<br />
- &quot;Shield Bash - DK's have their version&quot; - nice for DK :) I can interrupt boss every 45 sec and i can silence player in pvp for 3 sec with avenger shield (but ofc I play prot pvp only in AV or outdoor if i am attacked while on dailies :))<br />
- &quot;Extremely easy to achieve 100% better mitigation because Paladins can have 100% chance to block if they don't evade it because of Holy Shield.&quot; - because of that are always warriors solo tanking 4 adds at AnubArak HM? :-) But yeah in ToC i have 60% avoidance and 42% shield block with holy shield active, in ICC its a little worse :)<br />
<br />
ofc all healing and debuffing you can let only on healers, why should in example some retri pally use LoH on someone if shit happen and too much ppl get big dmg at once from orbs at Twin Val'kyr? They dont need to. But they can save someone or even raid. And I think that using of all possible abilities to help raid is something what brings you to cap.</div></div><hr />

i personally think argent defender should be ajusted to require some thought, for example, make it a button to press, and to make it differ from a warrior, instead of it granting the flat HP buff, make it trigger a 10sec-ish buff that you take a hit that would kill you durin this debuff time the ability works like it does, this means some thought has to go into the ability and it has to be predicted if you are going to take a killing blow, possible for it to be wasted but also can be very useful, this also helps in pvp being the fact its a button just make it not able to do while CC'ed so it is possible to kill a pala tank in pvp first time round if the CC is well timed to prevent argent defender from being used. this is just my personal opinion, i would rather see AD ajusted then the stam nerf, because of this i can lose spots when trying to get a VoA pug because neturally they all think more HP = better tank, even thought the tank i am competeing for a spot against is using all stam gems in every slot and then the special JC only stam buffs ontop of BS/LW stam buffs with two stamina trinkets to just about give them more HP then me when infact my gear is conciderabily better and i had alot more raiding experience.</div></div><hr />

I know this response is a bit late but...<br />
<br />
If the tank has 10k hp, and the boss hits him for 15k, he will die.<br />
<br />
If the tank has 10k hp normally, pops LS for 30% more health, and the boss hits him for 15k he will still die. 10k * 1.3 = 13k &lt; 15k<br />

&quot;attacks that Would Otherwise Kill You...&quot;<br />
It could be a 3 day cooldown and it would STILL be stupid to have a talent that basically says &quot;when everyone messes up, you'll still survive, through no effort of your own&quot;. It is the single oh crap button in that game that requires no player interaction, thus no measurable amount of skill, in order to use.<br />
<br />
Screw 'adjusting', this talent should never made it into live.<br />
<br />
... and yes, it doesn't matter that it's &quot;only 1 hit&quot;. It's 1 hit more than it should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
Whether or not you think this should be adjusted, it would completely cripple paladin tanks from ever being a viable tank during progression or if undergeared. I know the Main Tank for our guild (Who is a warrior) can Shield Block every 40 secs, shield wall every 2 min, AND last stand every 3 mins. Now as far as usable defensive cooldowns go Pallys have Divine protection (and if you glyph for it you get get a minor CD through Hand of Salv). AD is essentially a compensation for the fact that Paladins significantly lack defensive CD abilities to help their healers in hairy situations. So where in a high damage fight (such as festergut after 3 inhales) a paladin can only offer 12 secs of high dmg reduction, where as a warrior can chain together 42 seconds of damage reduction or health compensation.... So tell me how having AD isn't fair? Or atleast removing it to give Pally's some other type of CD?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2010-02-05, 06:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Noobs like you think its an i-win button when its not. Its a progression tool. Why? Because anything that hits hard enough to KILL THE TANK with one swing in a raid WILL PROBABLY END UP KILLING HIM WITH THE SECOND OR THIRD SWING!!!<br />
It'd be awesome if you could guarantee that. You can't, and that's why AD is broken. I'm aware that it's not an i-win button but it still ignores however much damage you took and reduces it to ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.<br />
<br />
<br />
All this tool does is delay a wipe. When AD goes off, the shit is already inside the fan blades. AD has NEVER gone off during an encounter and we ended up killing the boss; and our guild is a server top 10.<br />
For you, maybe. Contrary to popular belief the paladin that tanks with you (or that you play) is not the only paladin tank in the game. Other people play the same class / spec as them / you and there will have been many wipes that were saved and resulted in boss kills because damage that should have killed the tank, didn't. It wasn't just prevented, it was nullified.<br />
<br />
<br />
All this tool does is allow the raid to see a couple more seconds of the encounter while you are still learning the fight as a guild. <br />
Again, you're assuming they're about to wipe. That isn't always the case.<br />
<br />
<br />
However if your tank healer(s) fell asleep at the keyboard or experienced lag, then yes, it buys you some time, but I have never personally seen this happen.<br />
Congratulations on never seeing it happen. I have, many times, over the time since it was added to the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
I did just fine tanking pre-AD proc. I have never been picked to mt a raid because of the proc, so I'm not sure why a warrior cares so much about it. Give it a rest and move on. <br />
I'm not just a warrior, I have multiple max-level characters that I've raided with, but that's not important right now.<br />
<br />
<br />

None of this is a good enough reason to give a class a broken talent. If they're that dependent on having AD that they'd be useless without it then blizzard needs to fix the class after it's removed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for AD, I'd rather them not touch the ability for those that depend on it's sake cause Tanks are already in short supply already and we really don't need to lose any of them that can take but do have this proc. It does have an internal cooldown so it's not like it procs everytime but there are ways they could make it better overall than just a guaranteed reprieval from death for one quick round. It probably has saved groups from wipes many times, so I can't view it as a bad thing overall, but I can see if it is considered OP in the sense that if every tank takes more dmg than they have health then and one survives cause of a talent, but in no way can you say something that works is broken, because it does what it is intended to do. I think before doing anything with this talent Blizzard should focus on trying to increase tank population. It'd be nice to stop focusing on trivial matters of AD and look to the more important issues such as making the Tank role a more desirable position for people to play rather than just a way to get quick groups.</div></div><hr />

Tanking is not that hard but its a dirty job. Finding a tank is easy. Finding a good tank is hard. You can be the best tank in the world but if you fail once, well everybody say you suck. Then everybody reroll dps cause they dont want to deal with the stress. Adding to the fact that there not a lot of gear out there (not a lot of shield, not a lot of weapon) its beginning to be less and less interresting to tank. Most of my friend are rerolling...Why? Cause its a dirty job and its not that fun. Most people prefer dps and i understand them. <br />
<br />
Will all those change youre making it easier and easier for dk(a lot of them are noob cause its so easy to level) and its ok cause they needed it. But by nerfing Pally again and again, we feel like you are hitting on us personnaly. Dont say your not cause youve benn nerfing us again and again. Maybe we are a bit OP for trash pull but in front of a big boss i am pretty sure Warrior good warrior are kicking our ass. <br />
<br />
What im tring to say is that good tank are rare and by messing with there mind your geting them to reroll. My guild(pure french) si struggling cause nobody want to do this dirty job. <br />
<br />
Isn this a game? The real damage Blizzard is doing right now is not bleeding Tankadin to death...No what youre doing right now is choking smaller guild who dont have THE WARRIOR you love so much. We are less in numbers (about 200 players) and we have less option. Right now our MT his going to cancel his account. Not because of this change precisely. No its about the fun and the passion he lost while your hammering is only 80 again and again. <br />

Seroiusly Blizzard stop playing with the morale of my troop. Youre losing good casual client who dont necesserly understand all those change. They only thing they see is less and less option. You will loose more and more casual players.</div></div><hr />

Well, it gives me more time to DI someone and save us both a repair bill, so I guess that's OP...<br />
<br />
I would rather have another active defensive CD (besides Divine Prot) that I can choose when to use and would actually be helpful during fights. And people counting Divine Shield and BoP as &quot;bubbles&quot; for tanking...? Right...<br />
<br />
This nerf to tankadins is a reaction from Blizz to the QQ from the Warrior tank PvP nerfs that affected their damage in PvE somewhat (&quot;WTH, we got nerfed? Nerf pallies too now!!!&quot;). Guess what, our damage also got nerfed (holy damage scaling with STR, instead of STAM) a while back because of the silly offspec protadin healers in PvP, plus they later nerfed our threat generated through Righteous Fury too.<br />
<br />
Any time Blizz realizes that another tanking class becomes a viable alternative to warrior tanks, they get the nerf bat; because heaven forbid guilds decide to take them over warriors! They did the same to DKs a while back, and are now buffing/fixing them again when they found out they screwed them over.<br />

<br />
If a warrior lags a bit more and LS doesn't &quot;pop in&quot; at the right time, he's dead. If the paladin lags a bit and for some reason fails to use a CD on the right time, AD saves him. As simple as that. LS is useful for some other situations but AD simply gives you another credit.<br />
<br />
Remember Algalon? Prefered tank for it was Paladin... remember why?<br />
<br />
Anyway, for the current content the encounter that comes to mind with this conversation is festergut (mainly with 3 inhales). After bubblewall disappears from the paladin he still has the &quot;extra credit&quot; if he gets killed while the warrior has to carefully time his CDs to go thro it.<br />
Not to mention that if you get hit for 32k and u're standing under 1k hp, it'll &quot;heal&quot; you instead of killing you. The warrior may not survive it even with last stand (if we consider lower HP tanks and all that)...<br />
<br />
I remember seeing a tank dying with a hit of 1 (and all the rest was overkill). Not a very likely scenario but when I was analysing the combat logs, that death made me lol like hell. If he was a paladin he would've just... healed!<br />
<br />
Imho, push a button get ardent defender &quot;proc&quot; available (for some secs like LS) and keep it &quot;preventing death&quot;. That way the tank would have to react instead of just stand there.<br />
<br />
Edit: and yeah that extra second you get from AD can help the healers get you back to full in case they fell asleep and started the heal cast a sec too late...<br />

First of all, I'm a prot pally myself (Acia on Xavius EU), and I admit that AD is kind of OP due to the fact that it's a passive talent that just don't let me die. That's fair, I'll admit that. But why would you all like it to be an active talent? Doesen't that make us like warriors with Last Stand? I really don't see the point in doing that. Rather do something creative with it than making it more like Last Stand.<br />
<br />
As for me it rarely procs, and if it does it's mainly a wipe before hand. But I can't deny that it have saved some wipes in the past.<br />
<br />
And to all of you &quot;pally-haters&quot; out there: Stop with the &quot;paladins can't play&quot;-bullshit. Just because you have come over some noobs don't mean everyone are. Just look at DK's. We all think they are 12 year old kids playing because they can't do anything else. Well, that's a load of bull too.<br />

Paragon uses a alt raid to learn the fight so they dont waste attempts. So far both are &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot; Using a alt raid is no different then having to SS the entire raid using level 19 warlocks. What guild didnt bug or alt raid the encounter? So now on hard modes you alt raid the thing to practice and bring in mains when your attempts are done. Your given a certain number of attempts the idea isnt to bring in alts and practice then bring in mains to clear it. They limit your attempts so people dont clear the shit by hammering it out for 24 hours. But now people figure bring in the alts and mains to get double the tries &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot; <br />
<br />
This may very well be one of the stupidests post i have ever read. Using alts is not a &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot; som e ppl like to raid on multiple toons period, alt runs are a great way to keep your alt geared and ready to come off the bench and fufill a role in any given week if you lose a raider member or just another way to have fun. Some ppl are so amazing at their role that they are always pidgeonholed into doing the same role week after week, xpac after xpac. These ppl dont complain because they know how valuable they are to their guild so why not roll an alt to do soemthing different in a raiding enviroment. If you're expendable alt is used to learn an encounter that is loads different than blatantly bugging a fight. I run 10m so i can understand the 25m fights more, nothing clever about that at all, just smarter playing.</div></div><hr />

It could be a 3 day cooldown and it would STILL be stupid to have a talent that basically says &quot;when everyone messes up, you'll still survive, through no effort of your own&quot;.

A clever is use of game mechanics is basically what cheaters say to justify how they beat an encounter, using alts on the other hand is not bugging a fight(gasp!). Using alts is no different than using a 10m on your main to see/learn a new fight, like I said that is just smart playing not to be confused with a &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Disagree, panic buttons should be literal buttons, a button you have to press. Yes, it homogenizes the classes a little bit but they can still do all sorts of different stuff from lowering damage, increasing dodge/parry, lowering magical/physical damage only, increasing health, an instant heal or even an AD that you have to press that's only effective for the next X seconds.</div></div><hr />

actually if you were trying to defend blizzard, blizzard would be picking up a metal pipe and would be getting ready to hit you on the back of the head. blizzard made AD like that to prevent paladins from shield walling at any time they wanted. <br />
<br />
Lay on hands = forberance<br />
Divine protection aka Shield wall = forberance<br />
AD = Forberance mechanic<br />
<br />
wait, didn't forberance disallowed you from using any of the others? yea genius they made AD as a &quot;oh AD procced, good luck trying to shield wall&quot;<br />
<br />
then again you are up to something. lets make warriors not be able to Last stand until 2 minutes after they shield walled. and that is if they spec into lowering down the forberance</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, TobiasX, stop posting. Clearly you don't understand prot paladins too much.<br />
<br />
I've played a warrior tank since vanilla, and switched to paladin tank 3 months ago.<br />
<br />
I'm fine with whatever nerfs they throw at prot paladins, as long as they don't entirely gimp us. LoH? Take it. 4% stam? Take it. AD becoming active? Do it if you want, but in return give us something reasonable.<br />
<br />
Things I've encountered: During ToGc FC, as a prot paladin, I couldn't do anything useful, dispels? We got disc priest, can't kite/taunt at all, can't lock out healers like prot war. I went ret to help with the dps.. BOP was needless to say during the fight of course.<br />
<br />
I can't remember what else I wanted to post but<br />
<br />
TLDR: Paladins and warriors are two different classes, I've played both. Don't compare them, don't QQ, just move on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">drakonblayde</div><div class="date">2010-02-06, 03:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know this response is a bit late but...<br />
<br />
If the tank has 10k hp, and the boss hits him for 15k, he will die.<br />
<br />
If the tank has 10k hp normally, pops LS for 30% more health, and the boss hits him for 15k he will still die. 10k * 1.3 = 13k &lt; 15k<br />
<br />
...and actually your poorly though out example very well illustrates why AD is fucking broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're sending a tank with 10k against a boss that hits for 15k, you're an idiot. <br />
<br />
If you're not, then you're still an idiot, because Last Stand increases your HP by 30% of your MAXIMUM health.<br />
<br />
So let's work with some realistic numbers - <br />
<br />
If your tank has 10k left (out of 30k) and the boss smacks him for 15k, he will die.<br />
<br />
If your tank has 10k left (out of 30k) and pops Last Stand and the boss hits him for 15k, he will live (10,000 + (30,000 * .3)) = 19,000 &gt; 15k.<br />
<br />
But let's play with your example a little bit more. <br />
<br />
Warrior with 10k max hp goes up against Boss and pops last stand, boss pops him for 15k and he dies.<br />
<br />
Paladin with 10k max hp goes up against Boss, boss pops him for 15k, and he lives, with 3k hp. Healers manage to heal him to full before the boss hits him again, so he's back to 10k. Boss hits him for 15k again. Paladin dies.<br />
<br />
So what's the net result? It's still a wipe because you were retarded enough to send a pair of undergeared tanks against a boss who's average hit is 50% more than they have health. The paladin was able to extend the wipe by a length of one swing timer.<br />
<br />
Here's the reality - for all of those who are complaining that AD saves the occasional wipe, you're ignoring the fact that Last Stand (which has been around alot longer) has the exact same potential. I played a Warrior tank for about 3 years raiding high end content, and I can say without a shadow of a doubt that Last Stand saved my behind more than once, and enabled some really tight boss kills. Of course none of that ever gets mentioned, no no, paladins are evil and must be nerfed because AD prevents wipes!<br />
<br />
Get real. AD is just Last Stand on autopilot, and not having the flexibility of when it goes off can actually suck a bit. The only *real* advantage AD has is that it gives you a bit of a hedge against healers which are lagging, nodded off to sleep, or are busy playing with one hand.<br />
<br />
I will grant that AD may be a little more of a pain in the ass for pvp (though again, not being able to choose when it pops has it's disadvantages... a Warrior has the ability to pop Last Stand to stay out of execute range, a paladin has no choice but to take shots from the 'FINISH HIM' moves before his ability kicks in), but in terms of PvE? It's pathetic whining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tanks are generally your most skilled players, which means we dont come on boards like this one and QQ (like this) endlessly. The result? They don't care if they nerf us because the result is minimal. DPS have no problem trolling trade for &quot;40k hp unbuffed&quot; tanks for whatever reason (I have 36K unbuffed and have tanked ICC10 with no problem at all.) Then, when the tank isn't geared to the teeth everyone is quick to blame them, not stopping to consider that they got all of their i264 gear and the like because nothing dropped for the tank.<br />
<br />
Perfect examples of this: Name one Legendary tank weapon in the game. Or one Legendary Shield (that can be used outside of TK)? Or how about the fact that there are only roughly 6 tanking shields in the entire WOTLK expansion? Or how about the fact that we are the ONLY spec that has no Quel'Dalar? Or that there are only 2 or 3 upgrades for Rimefang? Hey Blizzard, it doesn't really benefit me to have Rimefang's Claw if every tank you see has one (or 2 if they are a DK). Whats the use in that?<br />
<br />
To top it all off, they just took 4% of my stamina. That is about 140 stamina! I would have to get 3 or 4 upgrades (TOC or ICC) in order to account for that much stamina, and then I'd just be earning back what I just lost.<br />
<br />
Give tanks a break Blizzard, we are the hardest working spec in the entire game.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have a paladin tank and have done ICC - at least as an alt in a gold dkp type run, I had no issues, however, you're an idiot. Tanks aren't the most skilled, they just have to know what talents hold threat the best, be decently geared, etc...<br />
<br />
That said though, this nerf is stupid. Paladins don't have an insane number of hit points. What they have is actually a huge amount of avoidance, especially in ICC, especially because of holy shield with adds 30% on call avoidance that, especially on boss fights is up all the time. If they wanted to nerf paladins, that would be the spot I would change. From 30% to 20%. But to change the health pool doesn't just nerf paladins, but in a way nerfs healers.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Avido</div><div class="date">2010-02-06, 05:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't recall a single fight in which the &quot;save you from an attack that would have killed you&quot; AD effect has saved us from a wipe that wasn't about to happen anyway. I only see it proc when either the healers are dead or the other tank is dead (on tank switching or cleaving fights) and it only delays the wipe. Well, it gives me more time to DI someone and save us both a repair bill, so I guess that's OP...<br />
<br />
I would rather have another active defensive CD (besides Divine Prot) that I can choose when to use and would actually be helpful during fights. And people counting Divine Shield and BoP as &quot;bubbles&quot; for tanking...? Right...<br />
<br />
This nerf to tankadins is a reaction from Blizz to the QQ from the Warrior tank PvP nerfs that affected their damage in PvE somewhat (&quot;WTH, we got nerfed? Nerf pallies too now!!!&quot;). Guess what, our damage also got nerfed (holy damage scaling with STR, instead of STAM) a while back because of the silly offspec protadin healers in PvP, plus they later nerfed our threat generated through Righteous Fury too.<br />
<br />
Any time Blizz realizes that another tanking class becomes a viable alternative to warrior tanks, they get the nerf bat; because heaven forbid guilds decide to take them over warriors! They did the same to DKs a while back, and are now buffing/fixing them again when they found out they screwed them over.<br />
Ahh, how I fondly remember the times in Pre-WotLK when tankadins where told to &quot;GTFO, you can't tank this, go respec holy or something&quot;. /sarcasm<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Man, I agree.<br />
<br />
Been a pally since Vanilla.. even moar lawl to pallies then.. *Go holy or go home.*<br />
Now since late-BC, when pallies finally became viable tanks, the QQ'n started.<br />
<br />
As far as now though..<br />
<br />
-Take the AD away, that's fine, I never use the stupid thing anyways unless I'm rollin prot-pvp. <br />
<br />
-Nerf our stam by 4%.. okie, W/E.. it happens. Back to where we were @ the start of WoTLK<br />
<br />
Just give us another Defensive CD. I don't think that's too much to ask for, no? <br />

i personally don't see a problem with AD<br />
everybody has their panic abilities, passive or otherwise<br />
if you don't like it, roll a pally and take use of it instead of complaining</div></div><hr />

Looks like Acrylic use multidoting technics like shadowpriest.Keeping full dots on the boss and doting and DSe on add with more HP .Adds with low HP not needed attention on affl lock .This fight is a great for affliction locks and shadow priests.</div></div><hr />

LS is! So sure, make AD into LS for pallys to and then we can speak of OP pally! I rather take the Hp buff from LS then die and get me back to 13-15 k hp! Its a huge diffrent in survivability between them!</div></div><hr />

You are retarded then.<br />
Let me explain why so I don't appear to be a troll.<br />
<br />
Ardent Defender - saves you from ANY hit that takes you below 0 hp no matter how much it hits you for.<br />
Explanation - you can take a 60-70k hit that was supposed to be mitigated by something and still live. More specifically, you get stunned on a fight like Anub Arak in which you can't dodge/parry and you take a few unmitigated hits. You're still fine. But you can't hit Last Stand if your stunned. And you certain can't hit Last Stand every time he stuns you.<br />
<br />
Last stand is an ability that you have to proactively use. You normally save it for when you know you will need it. However, you have to know when to need it. But normally you can just use shield wall for those things and be fine.<br />
<br />
From a raiding perspective, you must be able to see how much more valuable Ardent Defender is. Especially in a 25-man raid. You constantly have at least one healer who is focused on healing you the whole time. You almost always have other healers who are looking at their raid frames and tossing a heal your way every now and then when they can. Now in a raid there are many times where your tank healer(s) need to move or they die, and the healing on you gets sucky. With Last Stand, you may see yourself drop to 1/4 health and think &quot;oh crap I need to pop LS&quot; and then the very next second you are healed for 40k by 3-4 different healers and you just wasted it. With Ardent Defender, you don't even have to worry about it. If the heals get behind AND you get an unlucky string of hits... or those heals are a split second late, Ardent Defender will keep you alive.<br />
<br />
Another more simplified example - Let's say a boss is hitting you for 20-25k hits. He knocks you down to 5k health while your tank healer is either moving or dying. You pop Last Stand for 30% of your health which for most tanks is like 16-18k. So you go up to... 23k health, and then he hits you again for 25k and you die. With Ardent Defender, you have 5k health, he hits you for 25k and your AD procs and instead of dying, you actually gain health from his hit (also, if you have a good UI that flashes your screen saying &quot;AD HAS PROC'D&quot; you can also through a Lay on Hands on yourself immediately afterward... the combination being 10x more effective than warrior cooldowns).<br />
<br />
Ardent Defender is basically a Guardian Spirit that you don't have to ever cast and it is the MAIN reason paladins are currently the best tanking class in the game. To say LS is better is just absurd.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are correct but seriously, give up explaining it to those who think its ok. You will go in an endless circle, repeating the same arguements over and over again and NEVER get through their thick Ardent heads, because they are either trolling to see how many times they can make you repeat yourselves or are just that damn dense that they do not understand the logical arguements against the current state of Ardent Defender and how OP it is.<br />
<br />
To everyone who actually thinks AD is fine (not those who know its broken but argue for it since you're a paladin and don't want it to get nerfed--stop trolling, we get it, you won't admit its OP but know it is. We know it too):<br />
<br />
Since none of the previous arguements will do ANYTHING to convince you as you seem to either not read the posts or just don't get it, try rolling a different tank class.<br />
Any kind.<br />
<br />
Do it on live or PTR and see if the tanking cooldowns of other classes are actually comparable to Ardent Defender.<br />
<br />
And don't go replying with crap like &quot;lol I have ten 80s and know every tank class, so ur wrong lol.&quot; If you do you are automatically a liar as you either have not played other tank classes or have and know DAMN WELL that AD is broken.<br />
<br />
Shut up, I'm right.</div></div><hr />
