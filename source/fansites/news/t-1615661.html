Australian Servers Coming Soon<br />
We are pleased to announce that the upcoming deployment of Australian World of Warcraft game servers ahead of the games next expansion, Warlords of Draenor. This new infrastructure will support Australia and New Zealand and should provide a significant smoother gameplay experience for player in the region.<br />
<br />
Players currently on an Oceanic realm—Barthilas, Frostmourne, Thaurissan, Saurfang, Caelestrasz, Jubei'Thos, Khaz'goroth, Aman'Thul, Nagrand, Dath'Remar, Dreadmaul, and Gundrak—should automatically experience improved latency once the new game servers go live. To help those currently adventuring on North American realms, such as Blackrock and Proudmoore, optional free character and guild master realm transfers will be offered for a limited time.<br />
<br />
Q: What benefits will local game servers have for Australian and New Zealand World of Warcraft players?<br />
A: The introduction of World of Warcraft game servers hosted in Australia, which will support the Oceanic realms, should provide local Australian and New Zealand players with reduced latency, which should provide an improved gameplay experience as a result.<br />
<br />
Q: Where will the servers be physically located?<br />
A: The game servers will be hosted within an Australian data centre, ensuring Australian and New Zealand players receive the best possible latency.<br />
<br />
Q: Will I still be able to play with my friends who are on U.S. servers?<br />
A: Yes! Because the new Australian World of Warcraft game servers will continue to communicate with the existing North American hardware, players will still be able to play with friends on U.S game servers, just as they can today. They’ll still be able to use their Battle.net friends list to easily group up and chat, regardless of where they are playing.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the new game servers have any impact on my current characters?<br />
A: No! Because the local World of Warcraft game servers will replace the existing U.S.-based hardware which currently hosts the Oceanic realms, all individual characters, gold, and guilds already on an Oceanic realm will be unaffected. The introduction of Australian game servers will be completely invisible to players in the region, with the immediate benefit of providing greatly reduced latency; resulting in a smoother, more responsive gameplay experience.<br />
<br />
Q: When will local game servers be available?<br />
A: We’re aiming to have the new local World of Warcraft game servers available ahead of the release of the upcoming expansion, Warlords of Draenor, which will go on sale in Australia and New Zealand on November 13, 2014. An extended maintenance to the current Oceanic realms will be required in order to migrate player data to the new hardware. Servers will be taken offline on Tuesday October 28 with normal scheduled maintenance and we will have the new game servers online as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the new local game servers only be available to players who purchase World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor, or will they also work for players without the expansion?<br />
A: While we’re excited for players to take on the Iron Horde and help repel the invasion of Azeroth in World of Warcraft’s next expansion, Warlords of Draenor, all players will be able to take advantage of the introduction of the new local game servers straight away. Optional character transfers will be made available for a limited time for those players who wish to play on the new Australian game servers, but who are not currently part of an Oceanic realm.<br />
<br />
Q: How will the character transfer process work?<br />
A: Once the new regional hardware comes online, players who are already on an Oceanic realm will not be required to take any action to move to an Australian server. Players who are currently on a North American realm will be offered a two-week window to transfer their characters to one of the existing Oceanic realms. While players will be required to purchase a paid Character Transfer service for each character they wish to relocate, full refunds for each toon moved will be automatically processed and returned within 72 hours. Free transfers will begin from 6:01PM AEDT Oct 29, 2014 and end at 6:59PM AEDT Nov 13, 2014. Players will still be able to transfer characters to Oceanic realms after this time, but associated server transfer costs will not be reimbursed.<br />
<br />
Please note that while Character Transfers and Guild Master Realm Transfers will be offered without charge, bundling additional services, such as a Faction Change to a Character Transfer or Guild Master Realm Transfer will mean the bundle is no longer eligible for refund. To ensure the cost of your Character Transfer service is returned, first move your character to an Oceanic realm and then initiate a separate faction, race or name change as desired. <br />
<br />
Q: Will I still be able to do cross-realm dungeons and raids with my friends who stay on North American servers?<br />
A: Yes, players will still be able to group up and tackle dungeons, raids, Challenge Modes, and other instanced content by inviting people from their Battle.net friends list. Please note that Mythic raids in all global territories will not offer cross-realm functionality until later in the expansion.<br />
<br />
Q: Will I have to wait longer when attempting to find dungeons, raids and PvP?<br />
A: When using “Looking For Raid” and “Looking For Dungeon”, players on Oceanic realms will remain in the same pools as players from North American realms, which should result in minimal changes to current wait times.<br />
<br />
For PvP, the game will first try to match players on Oceanic realms for Unrated Battlegrounds with other players from their battlegroup. If successful, these groups should be placed on Australian servers. If two teams from within the battlegroup cannot be found, the groups are then made from the broader player pool and are likely to be placed on game servers located on the U.S. West Coast.<br />
<br />
For Arena teams and Rated Battlegrounds, Oceanic versus Oceanic matches should take place on Australian servers. Oceanic versus North American matches may take place on servers located on the U.S. West Coast. Whether a team is designated Oceanic or North American is determined by the group leader’s realm.<br />
<br />
Q: Latency doesn’t bother me, can I stay with my friends and my current guild on a North American server?<br />
A: Absolutely. While the current Oceanic realms – Barthilas, Frostmourne, Thaurissan, Saurfang, Caelestrasz, Jubei'Thos, Khaz'goroth, Aman'Thul, Nagrand, Dath'Remar, Dreadmaul, and Gundrak – should switch seamlessly to the improved latency offered by the new local game servers, players who currently have characters on North American realms can take advantage of optional, free character transfers. While no players will be required to move off their current realm, Australian and New Zealand players who opt not to play on Oceanic realms will not receive the same latency benefits as those on regional game servers hosted in the ANZ data centre. Please note that due to its high player population, Frostmourne will not be an eligible transfer destination. Players currently on Frostmourne will be able to initiate optional, free character transfers to other Oceanic realms at no cost if they wish to relocate.<br />
<br />
Q: Will local game servers change the way I activate World of Warcraft: Warlords of Draenor at launch, or any other Blizzard Entertainment games?<br />
A: No. The introduction of local game servers for World of Warcraft will have no impact on the way players activate physical copies of Blizzard Entertainment games, or the unlock timing or process for digital copies of Warlords of Draenor. While local game servers should provide improved latency, game activation and authentication will continue to be handled by the North American Battle.net servers. Players in Australia and New Zealand will be able to begin their adventures in Draenor from 7 p.m. AEDT on launch day, November 13, 2014.<br />
<br />
Q: Does this mean other Blizzard games will also be getting local servers?<br />
A: While we don’t have any other server-related plans to announce at this time, we are committed to providing all of our players around the world with the best possible experiences. Earlier this year we introduced local game servers to support Diablo III: Reaper of Souls, while Technical Alpha testers of our upcoming team brawler, Heroes of the Storm are already taking advantage of dedicated local infrastructure.</div></div><hr />

Having played other MMOs with local servers, I know it was a surprise at how fast things responded in-game. I've actually been used to the latency delay in WoW, and compensating for that as best as possible, but this will be great - no more dying to 1-hit moves because I didn't have enough time to move. I know it's not a 1-hit, but it'll make that Sha boss in the Shado-Pan Monastery heaps less annoying on a caster.</div></div><hr />

The same sort of thing happens with the matchmaking system in Heroes of the Storm with Aussie server. Will probably only encounter this issue when playing early in the morning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have no idea, during BC and LK for us in nz or aussie to raid 25 mans we had to purchase a service called lowping (there were others can't remember though).<br />
What this did was they had servers closer to us and they connected to WoW servers for us. Without this we all d/c constantly so it was another 10-15$ a month so we could raid.<br />

My oceanic ballers out there , you know how it was.</div></div><hr />

I would think that it would go to Australian Eastern Standard Time, so we should (and I mean should) no longer have the servers go down for maintenance during prime time like they do now..<br />
<br />
And so very stoked about this no more 200+ ping times now (hopefully..) :)</div></div><hr />

err not sure if serial but au and us are fairly close to the same size something like 7.5mill sq km vs 9.5 sq km. Regardless, au infrastructure is worse and our general internet is below average. I think most of the general au wow players would be happy seeing something like 50?</div></div><hr />

The difference here will be that you will have some South East Asian players who are on Oceanic servers and New Zealand players as well sharing the new Australian Servers..</div></div><hr />

I would think that it would go to Australian Eastern Standard Time, so we should (and I mean should) no longer have the servers go down for maintenance during prime time like they do now..<br />
<br />
And so very stoked about this no more 200+ ping times now (hopefully..) :)<br />
<br />

The maintence times will be the same as it is currently.</div></div><hr />

SWTOR had Australian servers... and then they made a big deal about it after the game launched, and offered free transfers and the whole thing. Fibre to Home Broadband to Server was less then 7ms latency.... then they made the game free2play and couldnt afford to keep the servers running EA shut down the Australian servers after less than a year. Thats the precedence thats already set :P<br />
<br />
Damn it... why is the transfer restriction on characters so sucky. Gold transfer limit is 50k per character.<br />
What are the options for a player to transfer excess gold in this move ?</div></div><hr />

Ah well I was hoping they would do like they do now for US servers and do it in the early morning period when most folks are in bed.. While I will be very happy to have servers in Oz seems odd to still use the US West Coast maintenance timetable.. Be interesting to know why this is so..<br />
<br />
Ahh never mind read more of that link and can see why they are still on the US West Coast maintenance timetable..<br />

I would say something to explain why about this but not sure what you are talking about in the first part.. As for the other bit having the Oceanic servers finally coming here is the best news for players over this way have had in ages, as have been hoping for servers over here for years..</div></div><hr />

Plenty of mention of NA players transferring to the Oceanics, none for current Oceanic players to transfer to NA proper. Both ways would have made more sense.</div></div><hr />

However, I've been playing on US realms for almost nine years, and now with two dozen high level characters spread across Sisters of Elune, Cenarion Circle, Ravenholdt, etc ... it would be a major hassle to transfer. Particularly the inevitable name changes ; I don't think I could rename a character I've been playing for so long.<br />

Roughly, assuming a perfect circumstance you could get data to Australia from the US with 60ms latency. So I would propose a system where Blizzard have a cache server setup in Australia that clones the data from the server in the US at a latency of 60ms. The players in Australia would then connect to that server, and depending on where they are and their latency, get the data from that server within 10-60ms. <br />
<br />
I mean, I'm sure it'd never be viable, but to anyone who knows more about networking, where would you suggest going if I wanted to learn more?</div></div><hr />

They could just be preparing for the future. Now they've got the infrastructure in the DC in Sydney, Australians can hopefully benefit for all their future games. They could have some deal going on and probably hoping too that subs in Aus will increase.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kortruk</div><div class="date">2014-10-25, 02:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It feels like the proper justice that all the Americans who have been reaping the PvP benefits of playing on the Oceanic servers all these years will now either have to pay to leave or be stuck with the reverse latency. I personally hope they don't give them free transfers, there may be a few rare cases where they were just there innocently. But the rest of them on the Oceanic servers were all there to take advantage of our high pings. Shame on them, karma albeit 10 years in the making - I say no to free transfers back to US servers.<br />
<br />
When my wife first made a WoW account 7 years ago, the initial setup directed her to Khaz'goroth when she chose US region to start out on. I believe this is the case for a lot of US players on that realm. When I started playing, I joined her there. I have 9 toons on KG and I'm not paying $300 to x-fer all my characters off the realm. At no point have I ever run across a player on the realm who was there for the &quot;ping advantage&quot;. Maybe because I'm on a PvE server? I'm sorry that Aussies were at a disadvantage for all this time, but it's not fair to the US players were unknowingly sent to realms like KG to triple their ping times and not give them the opportunity to transfer to lower latency. Who's getting hurt by allowing the transfers to work both ways? Blizzard is screwing the pooch on this one. Why should I keep paying for a service that is essentially downgrading my experience for the same price per month? Again, some players didn't choose to be on this realm. They were sent here by Blizz.</div></div><hr />

Those servers were under the &quot;Oceanic&quot; tab when they were released. They're not on the &quot;North America&quot; tab.<br />
<br />
I started 8 years ago and chose one of the realms on the &quot;Oceanic&quot; tab without knowing that these were in the US. Khaz'Goroth was there, along with all the usual suspects. The only &quot;unofficial&quot; Oceanic realms I can think of are Proudmore and Blackrock since both existed prior to the implementation of the Oceanic tab and Oceanic-tagged realms.</div></div><hr />

LOL no. International sub cables are located at Sydney and Perth. Since there's no way they'd put the servers in perth. they are located at Sydney.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't a tab... it was a question they asked when first starting the game. I know for a fact they suggested Khaz'goroth as a realm to start on when you chose US. I can't remember the specifics of the actual startup wizard for the game, but I know that they steered US players to these realms. Many other people have verified the same thing in forum posts over on the battle.net site. Even if that wasn't the case, which it definitely IS, it's still not an excuse to refuse to let US players transfer to continue on US based realms. Why would I pay the same money per month for a downgraded service? I already have Time Warner as my only choice for high speed internet. One terrible expensive service is enough thanks.</div></div><hr />

Greetings,<br />
<br />
Thank you for contacting Blizzard Entertainment.<br />
<br />
I understand that you have some questions related to the transfer off of Oceanic servers.<br />
<br />
We are indeed helping both players get to their Native Realm!<br />
Oceanic -&gt; North American<br />
North America -&gt; Oceanic<br />
<br />
Please note that we will not give free transfers to Oceanic player wanting to move to North America.<br />
<br />
With that being said, yes we can move you over to your desired realm in North America free of charge. Just as long as it is done before the cutoff date 6:59PM AEDT Nov 13, 2014.<br />
<br />
All you need to do is provide us the name of the realm you would like to move to.</div></div><hr />

look at a map, australia is a similar size to mainland USA<br />
