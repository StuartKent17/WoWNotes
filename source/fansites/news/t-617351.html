i'm fairly sure this was scrapped as there has been no word on it, maybe we should ask a blue about it lol.<br />

One thing is for sure, we'll probably see the Divine Plea change on this build, yay.<br />

Judging from the recent posts by GC in the lock forums, I wouldn't expect much, if anything. Spell pen to all pets is better than nothing though.<br />

Oh, and it's time to fix Mage Armor. Make it 30% duration reduction on damage over time effects.</div></div><hr />

Why not nerf the class that needs it? *OBVIOUSCOUGH* PALADINS. Holy needs buffs? In what way? You guys NEVER run out of mana and you guys can still do good damage. Buff you say? One Holy Light heals 50% HP? Buffs you say? I say screw that.<br />
<br />
Retadins need some huge nerfs too. Repentance should be a 3min CD and it should only last 5 seconds. Or if you don't like that, nerf the CD on HoJ. Make it 40 seconds talented and up the mana cost. Rogues at least need 5 CPs and energy to get their 6 second stun. Hell, you guys even do a melee attack that a Mutilate Rogue does with 2 crits now. Also, overall damage needs to get toned down by roughly 30%, so that's a 1.4k crit that would still proc Seal of the Commander. Your damage is too extreme combined with the best burst damage of all the other classes. You guys don't even need to bubble, and when you do, NP! the opponent is already in red, so just HoW that is almost a guaranteed crit for 8k. Warriors need rage for a good Execute, you guys just need shitty mana that you gain 30% of every 8 seconds from a Judgement.<br />
<br />
I've played the Paladin on beta, and still do. They never lose, unless you WANT to. And if you lose because you were outplayed, then you suck. Because ever since the Mutilate fix, Rogues can't even beat Paladins anymore. You guys have it so retardedly good it's not even funny. Paladins do roughly 8k in 4 seconds unarmed, so add white damage and procs and that's even worse. Not to mention the moment someone is in red, BOOM game over. You have NO real drawbacks other than being unable to slow people down. But it's not like you can be kited either. And quite a few of your skills are 10 yards.<br />
<br />
Paladins have so many advantages from other classes, with none of the drawbacks. Not to mention instant cast crit flash heals all the time. Paladins need so many fixes, like they need to lose mana probably as fast as a Mage does. Remove the ability for instant cast crit flash heals. And increase the CD of Hand of Freedom to 1min and allow it to be talented to 30 seconds from Holy. Also, Hammer of Wrath should use up ALL of your remaining mana and work like Execute and make it resistable ( but if resisted it shouldn't take your mana ). That means Retadin loses more mobility and can't spam stun remove. But gives Holy Paladins a chance to not to locked out of usefulness. THERE! Damage is fixed, Paladins don't spam instant heals, they don't have infinite mana and should prioritize and actually have ROTATIONS for survival and not how to maximize damage.</div></div><hr />

I stopped reading after, &quot;Seal of the Commander.&quot;<br />
<br />

Why shouldn't Repentance be on a 3min CD or have a duration of 5 seconds? It's the same as a Blind, with an extra 5 yards. And 1min Hand of Freedom that could be talented into 30 seconds, so it's an increase of 10 seconds. Take mobility away from Ret and give it to Holy.<br />
<br />
And if you played on beta ( which I assume you don't ) you'd notice in combat logs it says Seal of the Commander procs for x damage. X damage is pretty much the same damage as their melee swing. And also, if you were on beta, you'd notice that people are using it. So don't be dumb</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because Repentance can be broken when the target is attacked. Why have an incapacitate on such a long CD?<br />
<br />
Minus Hand of Freedom and our bubble, a Paladin of any spec has no means of countering being CC'd (if you don't count the trinket or racial, that is). We only use Divine Shield as a last resort, when we're in trouble.<br />
<br />
While you're at it, why not just make it so Ret pallys can't get anything that helps them in PvP? You're doing a smash-up job at trying to get them nerfed into oblivion again so they can't do anything.<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not on beta but I'm on the PTR and you'd have to be blind to not see that Ret pallys can get nuked from afar by Frost Magi or even Arcane Magi without so much as any chance to retaliate. (You'll note that I won't QQ about it either; it's just the way things are and I can accept that.)<br />
<br />
BTW, it's called Seal of Command. That and the other damage Seals were already nerfed a couple patches ago quite a bit.<br />
<br />
I get the feeling that even if Ret pallys' damage was nerfed further it wouldn't matter; the new Seal/Judgement mechanic as well as Hand spells being separate from Blessings is enough to flatten those dumb enough to let us get close to them. So all your QQ is probably for naught.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mean to sound rude, but there is no longer any such thing as a &quot;pure DPS&quot; class in Wrath of the Lich King. Even &quot;pure DPS&quot; classes bring utility now. Maybe if you guys would read what the blues say, you'd know that. (Blizzard wants all the DPS specs to be at least consistent with each other across the board. If you know your spec, you should be competitively up there on the meters along with the other DPS specs.)<br />
<br />
Say what you want, but Blizzard disagrees with you and this notion that we're &quot;way too strong.&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThatOneDude</div><div class="date">2008-10-04, 02:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While you're at it, why not just make it so Ret pallys can't get anything that helps them in PvP? You're doing a smash-up job at trying to get them nerfed into oblivion again so they can't do anything.<br />
You make it sound like this will gimp Retadins. They STILL have BoF that even they should be able to talent into. And as of right now, Ret+Holydin has the best results and never loses. So if anything it encourages them into being somewhat hybrids. So overall you can spec into a more frequent HoJ from Prot or a better BoF that still removes stuns from Holy. That also makes sure that these both can't be spammed completely and used with such synergy that allows Paladins to not be kited or allow more frequent burst damage. And if you were reading, this would've been obvious, instead you weren't thinking of what I said and just jumped the gun and thinking of &quot;ZOMG GIMPED&quot;. And I never said to touch DS, and ya, people use that as their oh shit button, but as long as the enemy is 35% HP or less, well it's game over. So Paladins have the advantage of a 20 yard 8k crit and only has to do 65% of a persons HP until game over......OPed much?<br />
<br />
<br />
And no, I'm not on beta but I'm on the PTR and you'd have to be blind to not see that Ret pallys can get nuked from afar by Frost Magi or even Arcane Magi without so much as any chance to retaliate. (You'll note that I won't QQ about it either; it's just the way things are and I can accept that.)<br />
Are you SERIOUS! Think about what the hell you're saying. You sound like you haven't even faced a Mage. I have no problems fighting a Mage on beta. Why? Because Paladins can't be kited and the moment you have them stunned after they blow their Blink, BOOM, it's game unless they Ice Block. And unless they have their WE out you won't take damage so everything is good. Once they come out and Blink, you hit Freedom and by then your HoJ should be on CD and you hit that and you basically win. If you seriously don't know how to easily beat ANY Mage, I'll even make a video of me not taking more than 60% damage with no bubble. I have no problems killing Mages. And most of that is due to the fact that the moment I have them next to me they're either going to take ALOT of damage or going to die. No offense or anything, but it's not hard at all. I've got videos of a Fire Mage duel, but that's not a Frost Mage. If I can I'll even upload some videos for you.<br />
<br />
Ok, ya, I have put Seal of Commander, that's a stupid old habit and I do that if I don't think specifically about what I'm typing for that skill. Odd I know, but whatever, it happens.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Here are some main points<br />
<br />
1) Getting kited? NP! Repentance is 20 yards and Judgments are 10<br />
2) You're in close range? HoJ and you only have a 20 second CD and it has hardly ANY mana cost, and every 8 seconds you're going to make up for it by an extreme amount from the 33% ( I say 30% alot, but that's just cause I don't care )<br />
3) An epic HoF or HoJ won't gimp the class, just make it so the class doesn't have such great advantages without any downfall<br />
4) You can't be kited unless you suck and you can stop people from moving any faster than normal</div></div><hr />

It's the same as a Blind, with an extra 5 yards. And 1min Hand of Freedom that could be talented into 30 seconds, so it's an increase of 10 seconds. Take mobility away from Ret and give it to Holy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blind is talented to a 90 second cooldown though, and lasts 10 seconds, not 5.<br />
<br />
Also rogues have a lot more mobility than a ret pally (imp. sprint, shadowstep, Cloak of Shadows). The most important thing though is they have a SNARE (crippling poison). Crip &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; JoJ (unless you're fighting a druid). Thus, Repentance counters these drawbacks by having a short cooldown (that and HoJ).<br />
<br />
P.S. I play a druid in PVP, not a pally. Alts are a lock and rogue.</div></div><hr />
