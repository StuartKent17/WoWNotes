A very small note about the Netherwing Dragonflight (http://www.wowwiki.com/Netherwing_dragonflight), leveling your reputation with this faction is now slightly easier because of the changes mades to two daily quests:<br />
<br />
The Not-So-Friendly Skies... (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=11035) - The droprate of Netherwing Relic (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32509) has been increased to 100%.<br />
A Slow Death (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=11020) - The droprate of Fel Gland (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=32502) has been increased to 100% as well.<br />
<br />
That's probably a good news now that most of the players are trying to get 100 Mounts for a cute Dragonhawk Mount. Below are 2 screenshots of the reward for the 100 mounts achievement because it seems that I never posted the horde version, Alliance players will get the blue dragonhawk and Horde players the red one. <br />

Lunar Festival - &quot;Elder&quot; title requires level 80<br />
The world event in and of itself is available to all levels and is one of the more accessible holidays. You can participate in more or less every aspect of the holiday itself, even if you're not 80.<br />
<br />
The achievements aren't considered an integral part of that holiday accessibility. They are meant to be marks of what you have achieved during the holiday. Visiting all the elders is indeed an achievement, and we see no problem with some achievements for the holidays requiring a certain level, as they are not mandatory for participation in the actual event. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14595320289-elder-title.html))<br />
<br />
More crowd control will be required in future raid instances<br />
There will be more CC in the future. We don't want every pull to require months of planning, and sometimes burning down large groups can be fun. But remember Noxromulus was designed to be approachable and puggable. It will get harder from here on out. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14595070061-will-we-ever-see-cc-in-pve-again.html))<br />
<br />
Haste for melee classes<br />
Haste is a worthwhile stat to some casters but it is not useful for many melee. We are trying some different things to make it more apealing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14595320084-gc-it-is-my-bday-and-i-have-a-wish.html))<br />
<br />
Armor Penetration<br />
Armor Pen I think is just undertuned. It is a good stat in general, but the amount of +armor pen you need to get to something noticeable is too high. We would like to buff it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14595320084-gc-it-is-my-bday-and-i-have-a-wish.html))<br />
<br />
Glancing Blows<br />
Glancing blows are something you are not likely to see go away. They are a big tool we use to balance melee versus bosses. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14595320084-gc-it-is-my-bday-and-i-have-a-wish.html))<br />

Ferocious Bite burst in PvP<br />
Ferocious Bite is on our list of &quot;probably too bursty in PvP.&quot; It's at the bottom of the list, but we will still likely chill it out a little. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14595320066-gc-feral-druid-dps-concerns-summarized.html))<br />
<br />
Feral - Cat DPS<br />
Cats might be falling behind other melee classes. This is something we are monitoring and discussing. There are some new glyphs coming in 3.1 which are more PvE-oriented and that might help some.<br />
<br />
The cat rotation can be complicated, but at the moment we're okay with that. If you play a little sloppy with the rotation (e.g. ignoring Rake sometimes or not keeping Rip up 100%) you generally just suffer a dps loss rather than the whole thing collapsing down around you.<br />

Beast Mastery<br />
Well put, and that's what we want too. BM was the highest spec before by a considerable margin (and has been for a few years). If it is too low now, we will buff it. It is challenging with dps classes to get the numbers within 1% of each other. But if they are close enough, then it won't matter for the majority of players, who can then play whatever matches their playstyle the best.<br />
<br />
Those players who always want the highest dps at any cost will respec for even a marginal dps gain, and we can live with that. For 95% of guilds though, that marginal dps increase is not what is standing between success and failure. There are very few moments in the history of the game where a few dps was the difference between success and failure for all but the most cutting edge of guilds.<br />
<br />
But first we just have to get all the specs to be marginally different from each other. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14578748409-hunter-bm-and-mm-are-broken.html))<br />

Combat spec<br />
Combat definitely needs a buff. We don't want to go back to where every PvE rogue goes that route (and many leveling too) but its dps is too far behing Assassination. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14595320084-gc-it-is-my-bday-and-i-have-a-wish.html))</div></div><hr />

w00t they want to &quot;nerf, while buffing&quot; combat.. I really want to see that ^^<br />

edit: First! .. <br />
well what I really edited for (well ok for the first thingie to)<br />
is.. that I've seen more and more new items with - Armor Penetration, examples the ones from WG and such.<br />
But tbh, it will take quite long to reach any good amount as said, that will make any difference atm.</div></div><hr />

So please, Blizz, make another patch or whatever it takes to fix it. I could live with having a broken class, but it's not okay when the game itself is broken.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Combat is not far behind, the difference in dps between equally geared/skilled mutilate and combat rogue is small.<br />
<br />
What they need to be looking at is the length of fights, short fights hurt combat dps compared to mutilate dps and it hurts both specs vs. other classes.</div></div><hr />

No, you're right. You get one for free when you hit exalted, but then you can buy all the other colors for 200g each in Lower City.<br />

<br />
QFT, several elders are in 80 instances... but the gundrak elder is 'hidden' in an area which is closed off in 'normal' mode... and for 'heroic' mode you need level 80. So either level your char real fast or just forget about getting the achievement done this year.</div></div><hr />

Or even better...give people both colors so in say, six months time, everyone wont be flying around on pvp realms on same birds and easy discovered on which color they have.<br />

Considering that one of the prerequisites for the elder title requires you to enter a heroic dungeon. In either case, you should gain the title as soon as you finish the meta, regardless of level.</div></div><hr />

We're not ready to announce specific changes yet, but shadow priest PvP survivability should definitely get a boost in 3.1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or even better...give people both colors so in say, six months time, everyone wont be flying around on pvp realms on same birds and easy discovered on which color they have.<br />
<br />
And while at it, female employees should be called reds not blues!..erh ok that one was a failed joke on my side *grins*<br />
<br />
1. Gender has no impact elsewhere in the game, except in some dialogue texts that you didn't read anyway... and that's got to do with limitations in the English language.<br />
2. Nothing forces you to use a bird you got this way, you've got plenty of mounts to chose from just BY getting this bird.<br />
3. Red is the Horde colour, blue is the Alliance colour. It makes perfect sense.</div></div><hr />

Achievemvents could have no rewards in the first place. Achievements could not even exist at all. Shut up already. Suck it up, like it or not. If you don't like it... don't do it?<br />

Grats on completely missing the point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The blue one isn't bad, but I'm Horde, and the red one is kinda meh.* Neither are enough incentive to get 100 mounts atm.* Yes, I know, too bad for me.** But still I'd have expected something a lot better.<br />

...that's a lot of work for a Dragonhawk.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sting</div><div class="date">2009-01-26, 11:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice list. I've already discussed it on another forum, and while in theory it is possible, I doubt we will see any dragonhawk anytime soon.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">elloria</div><div class="date">2009-01-27, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Who's to say they won't add more mounts? How can anyone think either of those mounts are ugly? Both are gorgeous! I'm at 56 mounts right now. You better believe im gonna start working to get the rest of the mounts i need for this. This will definitely not be as common as the albino drake and thats what i want. I want something that barely anyone has. IMO the red dragonhawk is worth the 100 mount collection. Its a shame we can't choose but i really do like both. Lets just hope blizzard gives us more mounts to get. Wether it be through questing or paying cash, or rep please add more mounts. We could use some new and different mounts just like the dragonhawk.</div></div><hr />

Calm down child, I'm not your best friend and these are not the official Wow forums.</div></div><hr />

You derived that delusion from the words in the blue post? Your imagination is filling in a lot of data that isnt there. Its fair to say they dont want it overwhelmingly ahead of the other trees, but thats as far as the message goes.</div></div><hr />

You can buy them from a vendor in Shadowmoon, once getting exalted.</div></div><hr />

If you don't like it, don't bother. 100 mounts is hard enough to get as it is now.</div></div><hr />
