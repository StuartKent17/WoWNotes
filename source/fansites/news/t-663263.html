Disparities between tanks<br />
Are you struggling on hard mode raid encounters because your guild picked the wrong tank? I understand that some of you are, but according to our data, it’s a pretty small minority of players trying those encounters. If you’re just offended that the health pools are not identical, then your argument isn’t going to carry as much weight as a guild that hit a brick wall because they didn’t have the best tank for an encounter.<br />
<br />
When druids couldn’t apply the Thunderclap debuff, that was considered a big problem. The fact that a druid can’t interrupt as well as a warrior is still considered a big problem by some. We used to let abilities such as Berserker Rage, Spell Reflect or Intervene play big roles on some encounters, but that inevitably leads to one tank being massively better on one encounter than another. None of the deltas are massive in the current game in our opinion, and we think that the number of cases of players who state with certainty that they can detect a difference is overstated. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19110419643-flavor-vs-balance.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I’ll attempt to explain this at a vision level. In my experience, the community tries to approach game design too often with “laws.” They know “Any tank class can be MT” is something we want to accomplish, but then they take that to trump all other concerns and expect identical tanking classes to be the only possible outcome. That’s not how game design works. Player flexibility (bringing who you want) is a big concern. But so is class distinction. So is making the game approachable. So is making sure all the classes are fun. It may seem like an inherent contradiction when you have two design goals heading in opposite direction (simplicity vs. depth may be the most obvious one). But that doesn’t mean all other concerns can get swept aside. You have to take everything into consideration when you make changes.

Primary strikes inferor to disease builders<br />
That was a direct response to the diseaseless rotations that just spammed strikes. Because DKs use a pseudo combo point system (in that they can use their &quot;finishers&quot; whenever they want), things have strayed into ignoring the finishers or over-utilizing them from time to time.<br />
<br />
I suspect it has more to do with the difficulty of keeping diseases up in a PvP environment coupled with the benefits of ranged attacks. The IT glyph is probably a little generous.<br />
<br />
Scourge Strike falling behind Obliterate seems to be largely a function of armor pen (a problematic stat these days in many respects). It's not at all ideal, but we don't have a great plan yet to fix it that didn't involve just buffing Scourge Strike (and possibly leading to diseaselessness again). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19378359805-shadowfrost-againseriously.html))<br />
<br />
Obliterate vs. Scourge Strike<br />
I don't think that's the whole issue. If Obliterate just beat Scourge Strike, then Unholy DKs might be using Oblit in PvP. Instead they're going to Icy Touch and Death Coil. Death Coil is supposed to be a bonus, not the centerpiece of the class. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19378359805-shadowfrost-againseriously.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage <br />
Mages concerns<br />
My point was that we don’t want Fire / Frostfire to have to worry about mana to the extent that Arcane does. Arcane is more about pacing. Fire is more about responding to what is going on in the fight. That is not to say that Arcane should run OOM constantly or that Fire has an unalienable right to infinite mana. Try not to take my comments to illogical extremes. :)<br />
<br />
When I say we want Fire to be about cooldowns, I meant that lining up your spells at the right time is the hallmark of a great Fire mage. I know a lot of players will say either LOL mages just spam one button, or else LOL mage dps is entirely RNG. I don’t believe either to be true, and the evidence supporting this conclusion is that there are mages who can do much higher damage than other mages, consistently and with similar gear. This suggests there is a much higher skill component to mage dps than even some mages want to acknowledge. A lot of that skill component for Fire / Frostfire comes in doing things at the right time (which we hope to contrast with Arcane and ultimately Frost).<br />
<br />
What those things are you are supposed to manage come in several tiers: first are Scorch, Living Bomb and Hot Streak. Yes Hot Streak has an RNG component, but not entirely so. Players still have some control over it.<br />
<br />
Second are things like Icy Veins, Combustion, Molten Fury, trinkets and even things like Flame Caps. Yes, I know that both Fire and Frostfire mages don’t always take all of those talents. A note on Combustion in a minute.<br />
<br />
Third are more external cooldowns like say Bloodlust and Power Infusion. Yes, other classes benefit from these too. But mages can inflate their damage dramatically when they line these up with their other cooldowns. In the BC days, a mage who really focused on that last 20% of a fight could see their dps nearly double. (I acknowledge this was a bigger factor when Combustion was a bigger contributor.)<br />
<br />
Fourth are factors that have less of an effect overall. I’m talking about things like PoM and Firestarter (not included in most raiding builds), and Focus Magic and Torment the Weak (not trivial, but generally up nearly all the time too).<br />
<br />
Combustion isn’t good enough right now. We get that. Fire used to be more about cooldown stacking when Combustion meant more. The problem is that we’re happy with Fire damage. We don’t generally like to nerf a spec in order to buff a talent unless things are really, really off. We’ll eventually (3.3?) fix Combustion, because it’s a fun talent. But we aren’t going to do it in such a way that just grants some “free dps” unless of course mages need it at that time. If you disagree that Fire is performing well, then I can understand how you’d disagree with our course of action here. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19110160602-the-new-real-top-mage-questions.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest<br />
Mandatory talents<br />
No. We're no longer in the business of giving specs a talent or ability that is so awesome that you just have to get brought to a raid. A raid should be able to function without a Shadow priest. They should want you because you're a good player, not because your presence passively makes everyone else better regardless of your individual skill.<br />
<br />
Now we don't want you to be a liability, which is why we want Shadow damage to be proportionately higher than it was in BC and why we want Shadow to have great utility, including Replenishment and Vampiric Embrace. No, VE is not mandatory. Yes, other specs can bring Replenishment. That's so not every raid needs an X before they can enter the instance.<br />
<br />
Do we see Shadow priests in raids, even in very uber guilds attempting hard modes? Yes. All the time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19378359822-shadow-priests--blue-response-.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior<br />
Rage generation scaling with gear<br />
When you get better gear, you do more damage. That’s progression. Assuming things scale reasonably well (though we tweak things so often now, I think scaling is less of a concern than it used to be), you should be at the same relative position to other classes as you progress. It’s a bad model that warriors start out weak but get stronger relative to other classes with gear. <br />
<br />
[...] Rage isn't an unalienable right. It's a resource. It has advantages and disadvantages. While you won't ever flame out the way a mage might run OOM in a long fight, you won't always have enough rage to do what you want at any given second (while the mage will probably have mana). Learning to manage that is the difference between okay warriors and great warriors.<br />
<br />
But suffer, suffer, suffer then explode with great gear isn't a great design. Why haven't we changed it yet? Because as with many changes of this level if we were to do it tomorrow it would feel really harsh to a lot of warriors. We do care about how our changes feel to the community, even if we sometimes decide to make unpopular calls when we think they're necessary. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19377449515-if-rage-mechanic-isnt-fixed-by-next-expansion.html))<br />
<br />
Giving Warriors more way to generate rage<br />
While that might be too dramatic a change, I agree that giving warriors more control over getting rage when they needed it might be a good idea. Imagine (I am totally waving my arms here and not announcing changes) an off-the-GCD Bloodlust with a much shorter cooldown.

And that we are not supposed to do any better dps because bla bla hybrid bla bla bla..<br />
Now, i would like them to justify how they are balancing paladins then..<br />
Really, they are great tanks, great healers, and great dps - And oh yeah, they kick ass in pvp aswell..<br />
So, where do we have the priest!? <br />
great healer, pvp healer, and eh, something they like to call a dps (pvp easy kill dummy), and &quot;dps&quot; in raids. :-s<br />
atm, spriest can't follow the lolretardin on most fights.<br />
Oh yeah, and then we bring a lot of utility - so that compensates for our poor dps compared to other hybrids.. -_-<br />

Actually, I think the bit about Thrall is less questionable than the bit about how Goblins join the horde, I'm sure they do, but why would they find Thrall on an Alliance boat captured? Maybe a boat for the New Council of Tirisfal...but Captured....why? <br />
<br />
As far as Thrall as the new gaurdian, I think Broll will be too busy, Malfurion will return as the Druid representative of the Council, and Awegynnsdf ds fe whatever her freaking name his will not want her grandson to be the guardian, as she can not deny here protective feeling towards him, and so Thrall will step up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For fuck's sake give it a god damn rest already! You people are getting really, REALLY boring now. The 10% thing is a caveat, something that any sensible person would do when presenting information that is unofficial. Blizzard change their minds about shit all the time, and it's highly likely (particularly if his info is a few weeks or months old for example) that there will be subtle differences between what's announced tomorrow and what Boub suggested would be announced. Any differences will be seized on by fucktards like yourself:<br />
<br />
&quot;See, I told you Boub's post was bullshit, he said Azshara would be a 10-20 zone and it's actually a 30-40 zone, he's so full of shit I'm never reading MMO-Champion again!!!oneone!11!&quot;<br />
<br />
It's Boub basically saying, &quot;Don't take me to task on every teeny tiny detail, but judge my Cataclysm post on it being right about 90% of the stuff&quot;. He has to caveat it because there are so many really annoying small-minded freaks out there who desperately want him to be wrong for reasons that utterly escape me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except thats not what he said. Saying don't take every little detail thats wrong as me being wrong all along is a lot different then saying 10% of my information might not be correct. All I'm asking, since you are one of the spazs you are complaining about, is that what he thinks is wrong is seperated from what he thinks is right.<br />
<br />
The fact that he is changing his changing his stance on speculating the information is merely an amusing side point. I don't want him to be wrong by the way, I just don't think he has gone about the whole leak legitamacy the wrong way.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rhorle</div><div class="date">2009-08-20, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe you should quote some things Boub says, and actually pin point stuff that you disagree with, rather than making generalisations that ultimately make 0 sense, other than arguing for the sake of arguing.<br />

<br />
I did, and pin pointed what I disagree with. But thats not good for you, so before you tell me to stop arguing just for the sake of arguing you should head your own advice. Nothing I made was a generalisation as its all about specific things.<br />
<br />
What is beyond me is why you are against knowing what information he thinks is not true from his leak? Especially when he is promoting it as a preview of what is to be annouced and blizzcon. Oh I forgot the fanboi factor.</div></div><hr />

Especially when he is promoting it as a preview of what is to be annouced and blizzcon. Oh I forgot the fanboi factor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How about, because it's not a specific 10% that he has had confirmed as wrong, but him making allowance for the fact that things will change? You know, like when Blizzard announced in the trailer for WOTLK that there would be new dances, and those ended up not happening because other development was prioritised? Did people go back to Boub then and say 'OMG you posted the trailer saying there'd be new dances and there aren't any, you fat lier!'? No they didn't, because it was Blizzard who omitted those changes at the last minute as they often do, and as they are bound to do with some of the changes Boub has reported, hence him covering himself for the inevitable shitstorm that will erupt if some tiny 10% element of the changes doesn't get announced tomorrow. <br />
<br />
You're acting like Boub knows precisely which elements of his post will be wrong and completely ignoring the possibility that this is a CAVEAT in case things change because Blizzard decided at the last minute that they either didn't want to make a given change after all, or didn't want to announce a piece of information now but save it for later on, closer to the release of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
My objection to your initial post was that Boub posts a caveat and you massively extrapolate from that caveat that &quot;Sounds like the sources are more highly probable speculation rather then actual leaked information&quot;- how do you get from '10% of the information might be wrong because Blizzard changed things at the last minute' to 'Haha, you had no insider information, you just made all that shit up'. It's got nothing to do with fanboi-ism, it's got to do with yet another boring, repetitive post alleging that Boub has fabricated all of this to mislead us all. If you don't believe it and you think he's just lying, what are you still doing on this sight? Go find another news site that you think is more reliable. Personally, I expect to find tomorrow afternoon that 90% of the stuff Boub mentions comes true. If it doesn't and it's all 100% wrong, I will be the first one with a pitchfork out. Until then I prefer to give him the benefit of the doubt based on the past 2 years of 90% (see what I did there) accuracy on this site.</div></div><hr />

Sure, for doing high DPS I run out of mana fast, but it's all about timing and using your Mana Gem and Evocation at the right time. If you mess that rotation up, yeah, you're gonna be sitting there OOM waiting for one of the two to pop up again. It's funny how lack of skill is an excuse for buffing something. You just end up making the good players even more powerful, which in turn will make the bad players cry foul and demand nerfs. It's a circle of ignorance.</div></div><hr />

I'm only worried about the Lore part, the Thrall / Garrosh thing, the source is reliable but if I can't get it personnaly confirmed I won't risk my hand on that.

Mandatory talents<br />
No. We're no longer in the business of giving specs a talent or ability that is so awesome that you just have to get brought to a raid. A raid should be able to function without a Shadow priest. They should want you because you're a good player, not because your presence passively makes everyone else better regardless of your individual skill.<br />
<br />
Now we don't want you to be a liability, which is why we want Shadow damage to be proportionately higher than it was in BC and why we want Shadow to have great utility, including Replenishment and Vampiric Embrace. No, VE is not mandatory. Yes, other specs can bring Replenishment. That's so not every raid needs an X before they can enter the instance.<br />
<br />
Do we see Shadow priests in raids, even in very uber guilds attempting hard modes? Yes. All the time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19378359822-shadow-priests--blue-response-.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I dont have any issues with the DPS I put out. While I may not be topping the charts, I am always very high on the list. My gripe is with the other statement. These talents he lists ARE mandatory because they are prerequisites in the shadow tree to get our worthwhile talents. If they dont want these talents to be mandatory, take out the fact that Vampiric Embrace is a prerequisite of Shadowform and that Vampiric Touch (our form of replenishment) is a prerequisite for Dispersion.<br />
<br />
If they arent mandatory, let me use those two talent points elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

It isn't merely allowance. Nor am I asking for a mathamatical 10% down to the exact word count of his past leak post. If he was making allownce he wouldn't have posted &quot;I really do not doubt most of my information at this point.&quot;<br />
<br />
That right there implies doubt of some of the information. You are nerd raging over someone questioning the information and are blinded by that. What i'd like to know is what exactly he doubts of his information. You are the only one here who is fixated on changes blizzard may make and think I'm crucifying him for those potential differences.

You can doubt information without knowing what it is you doubt. Like the previous poster said. it's likely he just doubts that all of it comes true because of blizzard changing thier mind or other such scenario. As for me personally, here's what I want to see in that 10% of falseness:<br />
<br />
Garrosh getting control of the horde from Thrall (unless he takes it by force which would make more sense being that garrosh is off his rocker)<br />
<br />
Cairne getting killed. <br />
<br />
Dwarf Mages.. I just can't see them getting interested in the Arcane.. not necessarily lore breaking, but needs a good reason<br />

Just because it was in Beta doesn't mean that it was good for the lore.. I'm sure the reason dwarf mages got pulled was because it just didn't make sense for thier particular race. They've always been a race of crafters and warriors and paladins. I keep hearing about the druids of the sun as being the explanation for tauren paladins and I just need to see more information on that before I'm convinced. As far as the spam healing gnomes.. bandages rather than actual heal spells? I mean Blizzard has come out and said gnomes are more scientific then religious, so they'd never go for the light<br />
<br />
As far as shapeshifting trolls.. there's more to being a druid then shapeshifting. What is there in troll lore that indicates that they would be one with nature and follow a druidic path?</div></div><hr />

That will make me happy, as a lore nut, pretty much that would ruin it because that would mean Saurfang is dead before Garrosh gets control because Saurfang would never let Garrosh start killing off political opponents who happen to be leaders of allied races.<br />
Plus Thrall is too kick ass to let leave.<br />
Oh, and that thing about Thrall being the next guardian, hope thats false too. Just saying, otherwise, I like the idea of the Horde getting a punting bag, I mean Goblins.</div></div><hr />

Thing is this isn't a news site nor is it journalism. It's a fan site. It's a blog. Journalists can't just go out and print whatever stories they want regardless of it being legit or fake. Care to guess what else is news reporting 101, not printing unconfirmed information. Then again journalists and news sites have consequences for printing fake news. This is all speculation on MMO's part. He could be 90% right or 90% wrong, but it doesn't matter because he can print whatever he wants to.</div></div><hr />

Hmmm... definition of news: Information of any kind that is not previously known to someone. The forum section that these posts on the front page go into... it's titled &quot;News&quot;. Journalism: the profession of reporting or photographing or editing news stories. Try again.<br />
<br />
News on television or in print form regularly relies on sources (many times anonymous). It's up to the person reporting that news to determine just how reliable their source is and whether or not to use it. Apparently Boubouille feels confident in using the source he did. We have no reason at the time being to think otherwise (short of simply not wanting to believe which is totally fine... but pretty irrational considering Boub's track record and the fact that we have no information pointing to these items being false).<br />
<br />
Mostly I think it comes down to people not liking the information for some reason and that is causing the negative reactions. Not much else going on here.</div></div><hr />

Blue posts<br />
Disparities between tanks<br />
Are you struggling on hard mode raid encounters because your guild picked the wrong tank? I understand that some of you are, but according to our data, it’s a pretty small minority of players trying those encounters. If you’re just offended that the health pools are not identical, then your argument isn’t going to carry as much weight as a guild that hit a brick wall because they didn’t have the best tank for an encounter.<br />
<br />
When druids couldn’t apply the Thunderclap debuff, that was considered a big problem. The fact that a druid can’t interrupt as well as a warrior is still considered a big problem by some. We used to let abilities such as Berserker Rage, Spell Reflect or Intervene play big roles on some encounters, but that inevitably leads to one tank being massively better on one encounter than another. None of the deltas are massive in the current game in our opinion, and we think that the number of cases of players who state with certainty that they can detect a difference is overstated. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19110419643-flavor-vs-balance.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I’ll attempt to explain this at a vision level. In my experience, the community tries to approach game design too often with “laws.” They know “Any tank class can be MT” is something we want to accomplish, but then they take that to trump all other concerns and expect identical tanking classes to be the only possible outcome. That’s not how game design works. Player flexibility (bringing who you want) is a big concern. But so is class distinction. So is making the game approachable. So is making sure all the classes are fun. It may seem like an inherent contradiction when you have two design goals heading in opposite direction (simplicity vs. depth may be the most obvious one). But that doesn’t mean all other concerns can get swept aside. You have to take everything into consideration when you make changes.

Primary strikes inferor to disease builders<br />
That was a direct response to the diseaseless rotations that just spammed strikes. Because DKs use a pseudo combo point system (in that they can use their &quot;finishers&quot; whenever they want), things have strayed into ignoring the finishers or over-utilizing them from time to time.<br />
<br />
I suspect it has more to do with the difficulty of keeping diseases up in a PvP environment coupled with the benefits of ranged attacks. The IT glyph is probably a little generous.<br />
<br />
Scourge Strike falling behind Obliterate seems to be largely a function of armor pen (a problematic stat these days in many respects). It's not at all ideal, but we don't have a great plan yet to fix it that didn't involve just buffing Scourge Strike (and possibly leading to diseaselessness again). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19378359805-shadowfrost-againseriously.html))<br />
<br />
Obliterate vs. Scourge Strike<br />
I don't think that's the whole issue. If Obliterate just beat Scourge Strike, then Unholy DKs might be using Oblit in PvP. Instead they're going to Icy Touch and Death Coil. Death Coil is supposed to be a bonus, not the centerpiece of the class. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19378359805-shadowfrost-againseriously.html))<br />

Mages concerns<br />
My point was that we don’t want Fire / Frostfire to have to worry about mana to the extent that Arcane does. Arcane is more about pacing. Fire is more about responding to what is going on in the fight. That is not to say that Arcane should run OOM constantly or that Fire has an unalienable right to infinite mana. Try not to take my comments to illogical extremes. :)<br />
<br />
When I say we want Fire to be about cooldowns, I meant that lining up your spells at the right time is the hallmark of a great Fire mage. I know a lot of players will say either LOL mages just spam one button, or else LOL mage dps is entirely RNG. I don’t believe either to be true, and the evidence supporting this conclusion is that there are mages who can do much higher damage than other mages, consistently and with similar gear. This suggests there is a much higher skill component to mage dps than even some mages want to acknowledge. A lot of that skill component for Fire / Frostfire comes in doing things at the right time (which we hope to contrast with Arcane and ultimately Frost).<br />
<br />
What those things are you are supposed to manage come in several tiers: first are Scorch, Living Bomb and Hot Streak. Yes Hot Streak has an RNG component, but not entirely so. Players still have some control over it.<br />
<br />
Second are things like Icy Veins, Combustion, Molten Fury, trinkets and even things like Flame Caps. Yes, I know that both Fire and Frostfire mages don’t always take all of those talents. A note on Combustion in a minute.<br />
<br />
Third are more external cooldowns like say Bloodlust and Power Infusion. Yes, other classes benefit from these too. But mages can inflate their damage dramatically when they line these up with their other cooldowns. In the BC days, a mage who really focused on that last 20% of a fight could see their dps nearly double. (I acknowledge this was a bigger factor when Combustion was a bigger contributor.)<br />
<br />
Fourth are factors that have less of an effect overall. I’m talking about things like PoM and Firestarter (not included in most raiding builds), and Focus Magic and Torment the Weak (not trivial, but generally up nearly all the time too).<br />
<br />
Combustion isn’t good enough right now. We get that. Fire used to be more about cooldown stacking when Combustion meant more. The problem is that we’re happy with Fire damage. We don’t generally like to nerf a spec in order to buff a talent unless things are really, really off. We’ll eventually (3.3?) fix Combustion, because it’s a fun talent. But we aren’t going to do it in such a way that just grants some “free dps” unless of course mages need it at that time. If you disagree that Fire is performing well, then I can understand how you’d disagree with our course of action here.

Mandatory talents<br />
No. We're no longer in the business of giving specs a talent or ability that is so awesome that you just have to get brought to a raid. A raid should be able to function without a Shadow priest. They should want you because you're a good player, not because your presence passively makes everyone else better regardless of your individual skill.<br />
<br />
Now we don't want you to be a liability, which is why we want Shadow damage to be proportionately higher than it was in BC and why we want Shadow to have great utility, including Replenishment and Vampiric Embrace. No, VE is not mandatory. Yes, other specs can bring Replenishment. That's so not every raid needs an X before they can enter the instance.<br />
<br />
Do we see Shadow priests in raids, even in very uber guilds attempting hard modes? Yes. All the time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19378359822-shadow-priests--blue-response-.html))<br />

Rage generation scaling with gear<br />
When you get better gear, you do more damage. That’s progression. Assuming things scale reasonably well (though we tweak things so often now, I think scaling is less of a concern than it used to be), you should be at the same relative position to other classes as you progress. It’s a bad model that warriors start out weak but get stronger relative to other classes with gear. <br />
<br />
[...] Rage isn't an unalienable right. It's a resource. It has advantages and disadvantages. While you won't ever flame out the way a mage might run OOM in a long fight, you won't always have enough rage to do what you want at any given second (while the mage will probably have mana). Learning to manage that is the difference between okay warriors and great warriors.<br />
<br />
But suffer, suffer, suffer then explode with great gear isn't a great design. Why haven't we changed it yet? Because as with many changes of this level if we were to do it tomorrow it would feel really harsh to a lot of warriors. We do care about how our changes feel to the community, even if we sometimes decide to make unpopular calls when we think they're necessary.

<br />
Giving Warriors more way to generate rage<br />
While that might be too dramatic a change, I agree that giving warriors more control over getting rage when they needed it might be a good idea. Imagine (I am totally waving my arms here and not announcing changes) an off-the-GCD Bloodlust with a much shorter cooldown.

Man....I completely trust you and I truly hope that thrall becomes the new guardian and garrosh is the new warchief...that is something the horde needs to return to savage blood hungry a faction. I know i'm a minority here but as a horde player I have always liked and been a fan of garrosh, as well as saurfang and thrall...garrosh is an ignorant violent bastard. As for cairne dying..well I like him too so maybe something else gets to happen. but oh well bye bye cow king.</div></div><hr />

The forum section that these posts on the front page go into... it's titled &quot;News&quot;. Journalism: the profession of reporting or photographing or editing news stories. Try again.<br />
<br />
News on television or in print form regularly relies on sources (many times anonymous). It's up to the person reporting that news to determine just how reliable their source is and whether or not to use it. Apparently Boubouille feels confident in using the source he did. We have no reason at the time being to think otherwise (short of simply not wanting to believe which is totally fine... but pretty irrational considering Boub's track record and the fact that we have no information pointing to these items being false).<br />
<br />
Mostly I think it comes down to people not liking the information for some reason and that is causing the negative reactions. Not much else going on here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes there's a fine line between news. gossip and rumor, and many people often see that line as blurry. And yes, many people are often quick to dismiss any unconfirmed information that they don't personally like, but at the same time quick to accept as gospel any unconfirmed information that they approve of.<br />

TBH I could really care less. Sure he is the Tauren chieftan but, seriously WTF has he really done? He doesn't go with Thrall to do anything. He just sits his fat ass in Thunderbluff. QQ he is the passive type, he doesn't like civil war or all out war on the ally Wahhhh.<br />

The thing is, it would be pointless because you don't have a proven track record. How many of you have been following this site at all? MMO Champion has a fantastic track record at finding out what is coming next. Exactly when was he wrong in the past?<br />
<br />
I hope all the people giving MMO Champion such a bad time lately are going to come back here after BlizzCon and give this site some credit. Sites like this put their neck on the line. There comes a point in any research/theory when you have to go public, knowing that if you are wrong all you will receive in return is ridicule. The work required to get this story out there must have been very intense and I appreciate that someone had the guts to stand by their conviction and post the story.<br />
<br />
I for one am looking forward to the official confirmation of the next expansion very soon!<br />

Exactly as the poster above states. If &quot;you&quot; were to open a website dedicated to WoW and provided consistently accurate information *year* after *year* and then you came out with a statement like that... yes, I believe it would be considered news. It's not simply that something is being said at random... it's the fact that a website that has a proven track record is saying it. Could it still be wrong? Certainly. Sometimes the stories on television news and in newspapers turn out to be wrong too.<br />
<br />
The only reason there is such a stink being raised is because for whatever reason there are a group of people that are angry that these changes are likely coming to the game. Instead of just being pissed that the changes might be coming they've decided to instead question Boub's reliability. Kind of rotten, imho.</div></div><hr />

IF this all comes true, I can see it being a &quot;what if&quot; scenario. Like maybe we take a portal into who-knows-where, and it shows us what would have come to pass if x event had/hadn't occured. It's the only thing that makes sense with so many sweeping changes to the lore.</div></div><hr />

I like the plan of redoing the old world a lot though. Phasing technology is awesome!<br />
<br />
<br />
For the last time it won't be phasing! (Well not all of it). They are redoing most of the old world.</div></div><hr />

So what happens to the people that don't buy the expansion pack? They get all that new content for free? They aren't able to play anymore? Nope... not gonna happen.</div></div><hr />

99.9% eh? That seems extremely bold, but if you're right, I'll have no doubt that you, most likely, have inside sources that you're not telling this community. Which is cool. Hope you're right man, IMMA ROLLING WORGEN!!!</div></div><hr />

his inside source would cease to exist if he told anyone, let alone the mmo com ;D<br />
<br />
thinking about it again, it would probably not, hehe.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure that the opening ceremony happens Aug. 21 at 11:30am PST (that's what is shown in the convention schedule anyway).<br />

Author told L the % lol<br />

Acturally, I do like the change that Aliance and Hord may involved in an even fierce confilict, Catalysm might to carry out more PVP area such like &quot; lake of winterhold&quot;, I believe that will make PVE server more interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like the removal of Na40 and the upcoming onyxia patch... They get less content... for free ::) <br />
But blizz can make the new 5-mans/raids into &quot;heroic&quot; mode.<br />
New zones can be just like the blood elf and drannei starting, no patch no entry.<br />
They might get some new content for free such as the new stormwind and bg exp, but thats it.</div></div><hr />

I say let's wait and see the racial mounts and racial abilities before we kill the goblin for being too gnome like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes....same here. I really think a new race will keep me in the game longer.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ham on Rye</div><div class="date">2009-08-23, 04:33 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sometimes there's a fine line between news. gossip and rumor, and many people often see that line as blurry. And yes, many people are often quick to dismiss any unconfirmed information that they don't personally like, but at the same time quick to accept as gospel any unconfirmed information that they approve of.<br />
<br />
I mean, I could post that one or both of the Goblin/Worgen starting areas will be playable at Blizzcon this weekend. Would that be news? Rumor? Just something I made up out of thin air?<br />
<br />
You be the judge<br />
<br />
The thing is, it would be pointless because you don't have a proven track record. How many of you have been following this site at all? MMO Champion has a fantastic track record at finding out what is coming next. Exactly when was he wrong in the past?<br />
<br />
I hope all the people giving MMO Champion such a bad time lately are going to come back here after BlizzCon and give this site some credit. Sites like this put their neck on the line. There comes a point in any research/theory when you have to go public, knowing that if you are wrong all you will receive in return is ridicule. The work required to get this story out there must have been very intense and I appreciate that someone had the guts to stand by their conviction and post the story.<br />
<br />
I for one am looking forward to the official confirmation of the next expansion very soon!<br />
<br />
Saite<br />
<br />
<br />
Chalk one up for my &quot;track record&quot;<br />
