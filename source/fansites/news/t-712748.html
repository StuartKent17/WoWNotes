We're continuing to refine the badge/emblem and PvP point systems in Cataclysm and we'd like to share some of those changes with you today. Please enjoy!<br />
<br />
Our primary goal when approaching badges in Cataclysm is to address a lot of the confusion that comes with these currency systems. To that end we're changing badges to a more straightforward point system, similar to the ones we've used for a while for Arenas and Battlegrounds. There will be a total of four types of points you can earn in Cataclysm (two for PvE and two for PvP), and these will remain the same even as we introduce new content.<br />
<br />
Here's the breakdown:<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Hero Points -- Low-tier, easier-to-get PVE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, but no cap to how quickly you can earn them. Earned from most dungeons. (most like the current Emblem of Triumph)<br />
Valor Points -- High-tier, harder-to-get PvE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, as well as a cap to how many you can earn per week. Earned from Dungeon Finder daily Heroic and from raids. (most like the current Emblem of Frost)<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Honor Points -- Low-tier, easier-to-get PVP points. There will be a maximum cap to how many you can own, but no cap to how quickly you can earn them. Earned from most PvP activities.<br />
Conquest Points -- High-tier, harder-to-get PvP points. There will be a maximum cap to how many you can own, and a cap to how many you can earn per week. Earned from winning Rated Battlegrounds or Arenas. (currently called Arena Points)<br />
<br />
When a new tier of raiding gear is released or a new PvP season begins, your higher tier of points will be converted into the lower tier. For instance, if a new tier of raid gear is released, your Valor points will be converted to Hero points, and similarly if a new PvP season begins your Conquest points will be converted to Honor points. Of course that means with these new releases you'll always begin without any of the higher tier of points, and thus be unable to stockpile them.<br />
<br />
As noted for Conquest points, the Rated Battlegrounds and Arenas will be sharing this same point type. Because of that, it will in fact be possible to get the best PvP items without setting foot in Arena; however, more powerful armor and weapons will of course require more Conquest points, so players who win their matches more often will still gear up faster. We're removing personal rating requirements on almost all items; they're definitely removed for weapons. We might offer a few items to the absolute best players based on personal rating, largely as cosmetic or 'bragging rights' type items. And you'll have the option of purchasing the previous season’s gear with the more readily available Honor points.<br />
<br />
We do plan to have a way to convert Honor points (PvP) into Hero points (PvE), and vice versa, at a loss. The conversions will be possible, but it won't be a 1:1 rate, and you'll have fewer points after the conversion process. We won't allow the higher tiers to be exchanged for each other, however.<br />
<br />
To explain the reasoning for the weekly cap on points for the higher tiers, this is to provide flexibility in how players choose to earn the points without feeling like they have to do all of the content as often as it is available. If your Valor income from raiding is sufficient, you may not feel the need to run Dungeon Finder every night, or perhaps even at all. Likewise, a PvP player could choose to participate in a lot of Rated Battlegrounds but no Arenas, or focus on both, and still be able to earn the points they want.<br />
<br />
We realize that with any changes to progression pathways there are going to be questions. We're eagerly awaiting any that we may have left unanswered. To the comments!<br />

Refer-A-Friend Rocket Mount Update<br />
Time is running out for those who wish to claim their Zhevra, as the launch of the X-53 Touring Rocket is now scheduled for tomorrow, Tuesday, April 27! If you’ve fulfilled all of the Recruit-A-Friend requirements necessary to claim a mount now but choose not to claim the Zhevra, you will be able to claim the X-53 Touring Rocket instead once it launches. Sounds like they’re firing it up for a final test run now....<br />

<br />
Kind of liking the idea of 2 types of badges, less confusion.<br />
<br />
Can't say much about the pvp changes. Weapons without rating will probably result in massive QQ from the hardcore, even tho I would say that it's a much needed change. Nobody really wanted to be forced into PVE to PVP, which is how it is currently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There's probably going to be a LOT of whine, but honestly this is a good change. If I had it my way, all the gear in the game would be free to all, so that gameplay could be built around skill vs. skill...not gear vs. gear.<br />
<br />
A 2900 rated player is still going to roll over an 1800 player, even if they have the same gear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patrux</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 07:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">No rating req? So it's basically a grind ANYONE can do. No matter how bad they are.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zet</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 07:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice changes.<br />
<br />
For PvE, this basically means more convenience, in line with the current PvP system, and less compulsion to hoard &quot;major&quot;-emblems. Although the daily heroic will become much more fun with Cataclysm of course; no more overgearing.<br />
<br />
For PvP, it finally gives us non-arena players a change to get BiS PvP gear. I never understood why i wasnt allowed to get a PvP-weapon, just because I'd rather stick to BGs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cause being carried by good people in Battlegrounds shouldn't reward you with BiS. I think it's too hard to measure anyones performance in battleground, thus it's harder to reward the right players for their effort compared to arenas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a good move. I've already said most of what I'll say about it here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/general-discussions/changes-to-the-emblem-system/).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really like this change for both PvE and PvP. This means that you could essentially do random heroics three times in a row and still get Valor points for each, and then take a break from the game for a couple of days and not feel like you are missing out. The weekly cap is something I was really hoping they would implement, and a points system with both a time and amount cap is a very good alteration to the system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Everything will be balanced and tweaked in the beta; but the weekly cap on emblems will be a good move. It will really take the stress off forcing yourself into content and allow you to do things at a pace more suited to your own timetable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Less stress; more fun. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
PvE) I hate having to run a stupidly easy heroic every day. Sure it doesn't take very much time, but I still have to schedule it. Some days I get on Wow only because I have a heroic to run. I love the idea that you can run multiple heroics for badges in one go (so it doesn't matter as much if you take a day off) or can get them all from raids. Hopefully this will also reduce the number of badges we get to the point where badges are used to fill in within a few gear pieces as opposed to providing half our gear.<br />
<br />
PvP) Mixed feelings about this one. I liked the required ratings on gear because it meant someone like me (who hates PvP) had no chance at getting good PvP gear (which in some cases is better than PvE gear even for PvE). So I wasn't forced to run arenas every week like I was in BC. On the other hand I enjoy BGs more than arenas so maybe I'll be able to get more into PvP this expansion.</div></div><hr />

After nearly 6 years of raiding serious (or semi at times), wrath just didn't appeal to me. Server firsted tier7, wasted 6 months farming it for crappy achievements (hai RNG) then cleared ulduar in like 2 weeks or whatever. Saw hard modes were a giant waste of unfun time (churning players endlessly sucks) and leveled all my alts instead.<br />
<br />
Now I actually might look for a real guild in cat again.<br />

Also, screw arena. Every time someone cries about arena being ruined or nerfed, I actually feel good. Its like god spawns a kitten somewhere in a little kid's arms instead of killing one :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You do realise how long it takes to get just one piece of gear when you lose ALL your games, right?<br />
<br />
Them losing 10 games a week and taking months to get the gear DOESNT mean they will then suddenly be able to beat you in arena...<br />
<br />
As long as you can still embarrass them by destroying their 5v5 in 30 seconds flat, what is the problem?<br />
<br />
Is gear REALLY that big of a deal in PvP? I thought PvP was bragging rights on SKILL!<br />
<br />
That's what always comes across with the PvP vs PvE arguments anyway...</div></div><hr />

While i agree with this, and would love to go back to Vanilla/TBC style raid progression, blizzard are just not going to do it.<br />
<br />
They are happy enough with giving us the Weekly Raid quests in order to make us view old content.<br />
<br />
Maybe they should extend the Weekly Raid Quest to actually be an entire raid, not just a single boss ;)</div></div><hr />

I can agree that gear for people starting arena is difficult to come by because of the cost.<br />
<br />
So, if you're worried about people not having access to it then change the requirement for &quot;conquest&quot; points, but don't punish the skilled people by allowing anyone the ability to get items previously unattainable before 1800. <br />
<br />
As a DK I've seen you guys rip apart the class over and over. It took time and energy to get weapons and higher-end pvp gear, but that's a good thing. It similar to progression in PVE. Why take that away from people?<br />

This expansion is all about how many more casuals they can rein in, and anyone who thinks Blizzard is thinking about anything but the bottom line is naive.</div></div><hr />

For PvE, this basically means more convenience, in line with the current PvP system, and less compulsion to hoard &quot;major&quot;-emblems. Although the daily heroic will become much more fun with Cataclysm of course; no more overgearing.<br />
<br />
<br />
•Valor Points -- High-tier, harder-to-get PvE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, as well as a cap to how many you can earn per week. Earned from Dungeon Finder daily Heroic and from raids. (most like the current Emblem of Frost)<br />
<br />
<br />
Still the same shit. Only different names. I really don't get it. This is a huge problem and annoying thing now, but they just stick with it. &quot;You don't have to do that daily dungeon every day.&quot; Right, like that's going to happen.<br />
<br />
And getting PvP weapons by doing BG's. How does that work? I will just buy a PvP weapon by solo content instead of wasting hours in a raid. Like LK weapons that won't drop for weeks.<br />
They can't have PvP gear with lower ilvl than raid gear, because then it's better to PvP with PvE gear again.</div></div><hr />

Read a little more there mate. It states there is a weekly cap on acquiring. So theoretically the numbers may work out where if you do all the raids you could end up only having enough points left to get before cap for like one heroic. In other words you get to choose. Do a lot of heroics and some raids to cap out my week, then raid rest for gear. Or, bank on fact that I'll do all the raids and only do a heroic this week.

Yeah but when can you be a 100% certain that you will do all the available raid bosses in a week. Very few people get to have perfect raid attendance in guild, and PuGs can rarely complete same tier raid content (unless we are talking about something as weak as ToC).

<br />
The cap is still unkown But lets assume that clearing everything in the current 25man tier = cap. On top of that they want to continue &quot;gating&quot; the encounters. So basically what you said only applies when the whole raid is unlocked AND your Guild has the whole thing on farm-status (assuming you only get points when the big bad dude bites the dust ;) ). Until then I highly doubt you will get to the cap simply by raiding. So for max progression you HAVE TO DO the heroics just like when ICC was out and you didn't have it on farm / it wasn't unlocked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But I'm critisizing the daily concept as such. It just sucks that when I'm in the mood to grind a little I'm not allowed to. And that when I don't want to play on one day I lose progression. Irreversibly. (Take the JC Quest for an example and compare it to the system with which enchanters get their manuals.) Daily-Quests are like an annoying cage that constantly restricts your movement in the game world and punishes you for not logging in every day. Imo that's bad game design.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it is. But if you're super skilled enough to get the highest tier already and be worried about this, you'll still faceroll them, because it ends up being a skill test rather than a gear test.<br />
<br />

If your good you go for titles etc, it is fair gear be available to all, as pve gear is for who doesnt even put a feet on a raid.<br />
Now the speed a bad will get the gear will be slower than a good player that's the difference and that's fair. so i rolled a warrior and i need to get a icc weapon for put a step at arena and starting with furious against relentless doesnt help when you match the bads with relentless /wrathful even if they are bads they are slowing you with better gear at fail 1.7 ratings.</div></div><hr />

Helmet or not, people will still die on motorcycles because they are morons. A badge cap and gated instances will not stop players from playing 60+ hours a week - they will simply roll alts or became achievement hounds.<br />
<br />
It's not so much to prevent people from playing 60+ hours per week as it is to remove the requirement. As it stands, you must play X hours per week or you will fall behind. In Cataclysm, they're cutting it in half.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More people getting resi gear = you quitting? Afraid there'll be no more one-shotting PvE-geared players? Just quit, we don't want you HK-farming-in-the-middle-of-WSG-players. <br />
<br />
I love the PvP-changes. Seems like Blizz is going the way of making PvP requiring more skill, with larger health pools, more resi-gear easier availible. The battles will last longer, and there'll be NO more oneshotting. People will actually have to think to be able to win. I can't wait! Only thing is that I gotta hurry up with getting my Battlemaster, there's no way we'll be getting 1600-0's with this system. It's designed around balancing and stretching out games.</div></div><hr />

It states there is a weekly cap on acquiring. So theoretically the numbers may work out where if you do all the raids you could end up only having enough points left to get before cap for like one heroic. In other words you get to choose. Do a lot of heroics and some raids to cap out my week, then raid rest for gear. Or, bank on fact that I'll do all the raids and only do a heroic this week. Basically it lets yo u choose time timetables better.<br />
<br />
<br />
No and no mate. I have read, and you are not answering this chap's question. It seems to me that he was keen on knowing whether you could finally &quot;chain&quot; clear your 7 daily heroics of the week to make up for the days that you can't log on and do your daily.<br />
<br />
That's a point that was raised before, that Blizzard said they might address in the expansion. The reason why you can currently only get 2 frost per day through dailies was to impose that virtual &quot;emblem cap&quot; of 14 per week via heroic dungeons.<br />
<br />
Maybe i dont understand the blue post correctly but it seems that you still wont be able to let's say, dedicate your sunday morning doing all of your week's dailies in one go. In the end, your dont go over the cap, and that gives all players more flexibility.<br />
<br />
The week cap is not good news for those who had the time to raid and do their dailies. It most likely means that the sum of all raid emblem drops of one lockout + each daily of that week &lt; Weekly cap. Or else there would be no point in having a cap, now would there?<br />
<br />
Someone correct me if i'm wrong but it looks like the community asked to have flexibility over the daily heroic system and instead got a weekly emblem cap to make sure the busiest of us can't farm too many emblems... ???</div></div><hr />

YOU don't understand what &quot;cap&quot; means...<br />

Cap isn't &quot;maximum&quot;, when you have cleared ICC 10/25, the weekly, Toravon 10/25 and 7 random a week you haven't &quot;reach the cap&quot;, you have reach &quot;the maximum per week&quot;<br />

[educated guess] Cap = 25man content clear.. That way they can let 10man give fewer Points so as a 10 man raider you have to fill up the rest with daily heroics. 25man raiders have the advantage here as they said they would have. In reality this change will barely be noticeable, because by the time you have 25man on farm you most likely will have almost everything you need to buy with your points anyway....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Core</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 09:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cap is still unkown But lets assume that clearing everything in the current 25man tier = cap. On top of that they want to continue &quot;gating&quot; the encounters. So basically what you said only applies when the whole raid is unlocked AND your Guild has the whole thing on farm-status (assuming you only get points when the big bad dude bites the dust ;) ). Until then I highly doubt you will get to the cap simply by raiding. So for max progression you HAVE TO DO the heroics just like when ICC was out and you didn't have it on farm / it wasn't unlocked.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But I'm critisizing the daily concept as such. It just sucks that when I'm in the mood to grind a little I'm not allowed to. And that when I don't want to play on one day I lose progression. Irreversibly. (Take the JC Quest for an example and compare it to the system with which enchanters get their manuals.) Daily-Quests are like an annoying cage that constantly restricts your movement in the game world and punishes you for not logging in every day. Imo that's bad game design.<br />

The thing is I'm trying to think of people that are stockpiling Frosties now. I mean my paladin has all the T10 I need, dunno if I'm gonna go for offset or offspec stuff next. But I already don't see much of a point of stockpilling more Frosties (since Saronite devaluated to a point where it's probably not worth selling them anymore. I understand there is a difference between how many you can earn in a week and how many you are allowed at any one time (5k arena points, 75k honour). The thing is we will probably be spending our points faster (or at the same rate) that we are accumulating them especially if for every new tier/pvp season, the higher tier points get dragged down to the lower tier which means that you might loose out on lower tier points (if you didn't spend them all before patch day). AND by the time the new tier comes out if you still needed T11 offspec stuff you aren't in a serious enough raiding guild to be concerned about the cap in the first place.</div></div><hr />

This is a great change.. Gearing up PvP alts? np, just grind it out. If you're really better than the &quot;pve geared nabs&quot; you should have no problem with them gearing up for PvP aswell. You'll still have team ratings to show off and hopefully some nice &quot;showoff&quot; items for the higher rated PvPers.<br />

<br />
<br />
Yes mate, thanks for your reply. However, i still maintain what i said in my post, even if i understand the point you are making in yours.<br />
<br />
The issue here with this piece of news is two-fold:<br />
<br />
1) In your example of &quot;cap&quot;, that chap who is clearing the 25 man lockout is stuck with the &quot;impossibility&quot; of farming more emblems through the daily dungeon system. Virtual example: your guild is imba and raids 8pm-12pm every day. You get home after work at 6pm, chill a bit, watch tv/do your girlfriend etc... it's 7.15pm. You have the time do do your daily before your raid. However, with the new system, at some point late in the week you will stop earning emblems before the end of the lockout. That's of course when the said cap is around the total of emblem you can get be clearing a 25 lockout, as you suggested.<br />
<br />
2) The issue of daily heroic flexibility is not solved. I believe i am not the only one with activities at night, footie, gym, demanding girlfriend etc... in that respect, i wished that the &quot;get a max of 2 emblems per day through heroics&quot; be altered to &quot;get a max of 14 emblems per week through heroics&quot;. The two are very distinct: in the former, you have to log on 7 different days of the week, in the latter, you can do 7 runs in one go. And that is just flexibility.<br />
<br />
Once again, it might just be all of us misunderstanding the blue post but it seems clear to me that daily remains daily... and that's not even a change in essence.<br />
<br />
Last thing, i repeat myself again but there is not point in having a weekly cap higher than what is mathematically attainable; and this means that this new system is most likely going to bring more restrictions upon us... and that's not great... :-\</div></div><hr />

This is just the same shit as WotLK. They keep giving away ridiculous gear from heroic 5 man dungeons. Instead they should make people gear from raids. Maybe give a buff that increases in time like in ICC when a new tier is released. Or let bosses drop more loot when a new tier is released. At least then people will play these raids wich are a lot of fun. They will actually learn something from them, but with a 30% buff they will still be able to finish it fast and gear up fast.<br />

Chest / Legs and Helmet right. I'm pretty sure since Wrath that is the most expensive badge reward. Imagine this is the cap, so you have 12bosses in ICC + Valkyr so that's 25 Frost a week in 25man, 13 frost in 10man ? + 19 a week (heroic + weekly raid). So in a week you can earn anything from 0 to 57 Frost Emblems<br />
<br />
Takes two weeks of FULL CLEARS to buy a 95 Frost piece. How many guilds in the world do that on a weekly basis ? Hell I clear 11/12 every week (10s) and do my heroic almost everyday takes me shit loads of time to get 95. <br />
<br />
I think the cap will be a non issue tbh. They are just adding one so you will actually spend them on stuff to enjoy the game (be it for you offspec for you alt (BoA items) etc).</div></div><hr />

There's probably going to be a LOT of whine, but honestly this is a good change. If I had it my way, all the gear in the game would be free to all, so that gameplay could be built around skill vs. skill...not gear vs. gear.<br />
<br />
A 2900 rated player is still going to roll over an 1800 player, even if they have the same gear.<br />

If you are GOOD you get stuff within a couple of weeks, if you are BAD it can takes months. I don't see the problem. Run an arena point calculator on somoeone at 2200 and someone at 500 (yes they are THAT BAD) and tell me how long it takes the baddies to get their Wrathfull set. <br />
<br />
You need 10470 to get a full S8 set :<br />
<br />
at 2200 rating in 3s you win 1118/week, 10470/1118=9.36 weeks, 2 months 1 week to get full S8.<br />
at 500 rating in 3s you win 109/week, 10470/109=96 weeks <br />
<br />
<br />
WHY THE FUCK DO YOU CARE IF THEY CAN GET IT, don't you realise that 96 weeks is like NEARLY two years, and that by the time they actually get S8, S9 will be out etc....<br />
<br />
<br />
edit : just realised my point was invalid due to the new system. But I think you still need to factor in the time vs reward of arenas and rated BGs, the baddies might just give up, or end up stuck at 1100 rated BGs when you are at 1800 or whatever. THERE WILL STILL BE A CANYON between good and bad players. <br />
<br />
Everyone is reading the patch notes and thinking OMG not free epics AGAIN ! <br />
<br />
The way it'll work will be the same thing as now, Good players rock in T10 / S8, bad players will be stuck in T9 / S7 and EVENTUALLY get some T10 / S8 but by the time they get it, it will be meaningless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Pvp changes are... ugh. I love and hate the idea that the new arena points come from both bgs and arena, and have a cap. Its nice because you always have weeks where you don't feel like bothering with arena, and you can from what im reading, just spam the heck out of rated bgs and eventually reach the point cap for the week. <br />
<br />
Its also a bit bothersome for higher rated pvpers. One of the nice perks of progressing your teams was to get<br />
<br />
1.) BIS pvp gear (t2 weps/shoulders/whatever)<br />
<br />
2.) Getting your set gear faster, from getting more points per week<br />
<br />
They seem to be axing the rating requirement on all items except &quot;cosmetic&quot;. And since theres a point cap, pretty much everyone will have the exact same gear, at the exact same pace regardless of player skill. I'm all for letting people have the same gear, so the game revolves more around the players skill then gear, but its still ruining a ton of the appeal of doing arena in general. <br />
<br />
I'll still play arena because I love the competition, but I still think its going to destroy a big deal of the arena player base. <br />
<br />
Makes it alot easier to get all my alts pvp geared as well though I guess :P</div></div><hr />

Why would you care about free epics if you don't factor in the time it actually takes to get them for a type of person you despise. <br />
<br />
The baddies pay just as much as you do per month. They should be allowed to have the same rewards as the &quot;elite&quot;. Does that mean they will get it at the same pace ? NO. Does that justify the &quot;elite&quot; being angry and QQ about it ? I don't think so.</div></div><hr />

You don't develop skill for fun, you develop it into complete some task and enjoy the result. Result itself is fun, not the process of learning (well at least for most people). And if the result is a lackluster, then more people will feel like it's not worth the effort.<br />

Now, now, sir, we don't know the point rewards and costs for cataclysm yet, and the way it's going I feel they're going to be somewhat boosted. Oh and don't exaggerate please, no one stays at 500 rating, even the baddies get gear a LOT quicker than 109 points/week :&gt;<br />
<br />
Oh and just to rain on the happy pro-bg parade :&gt; Chances are that bgs will get a lot more competitive in cataclysm, and it's a very big question if they're going to stay as enjoyable as they are now :) Since hard competition tends to bring stress.</div></div><hr />

I think it's too hard to measure anyones performance in battleground, thus it's harder to reward the right players for their effort compared to arenas.<br />
<br />
<br />
So you think 5 mans should give much better gear than 25 player raids? More people to carry you in a raid. <br />
<br />
One person in a raid is ultimately worth less than one in a 5 man, and can completely slack off if they want to. Yes they can be noticed and kicked, but this is largely a function of cross-realm battlegrounds, and same server only raids.<br />
<br />
If full premade teams (that only face other full premades) are allowed for rated BGs, then it'll be quite easy to measure someone's abilty and have them penalised for not performing.<br />
Granted we haven't seen how this will all pan out, but I think it'll be quite hard for someone who just &quot;random BGs&quot; to get the best gear.</div></div><hr />

Valor Points -- High-tier, harder-to-get PvE points. Maximum cap to how many you can own, as well as a cap to how many you can earn per week. Earned from Dungeon Finder daily Heroic and from raids. (most like the current Emblem of Frost)<br />
<br />
Is everyone missing the point that they mentioned. There is a cap on the &quot;newest&quot; badges and how they are earned. For example you can run a daily heroic all 7 days and get your badges for the week or you can go clear an entire raid and get the same amount. You aren't being forced to run daily heroic + raid to get all you can. That's what they are steering away from because they know how much people dislike it. Granted what I mentioned is a little on the low end. Will more than likely be something like 2 raids + 1 daily heroic = cap for week or something or 7 daily heroics + 1 raid = cap for week depending on which you prefer/have time for. That's what I'm assuming they are meaning by the way they mention cap.</div></div><hr />

Wish they would do that right away. Would be fun with pvp weapons in BG only too.<br />

That way the hardcore arena dudes could flash around in the latest gear while we BG fighters could &quot;drive around in the used model&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the hardcore raiders who make 5% of the playerbase get only HC raids and (more) Valor Points? While the rest of us stick with normal raids we only can do either on 10 or 25 man, but not both. And we get also Valor Points, only less.<br />

I am waiting for the announcement that you can skip all the bosses before the end boss. And use a lever to instant kill it or well not pull the lever and fight it.</div></div><hr />

You can run Heroics for currency that exchanged for gear that is 40 ilvls above what actually drops from the heroic. So therefore the loot is wasted. Blizzard just likes bitch slapping their players to farm old content :S</div></div><hr />

The only thing rated BG's will grant you are titles and points to purchase more stuff with, that's enough incentive for them.<br />

<br />
Same thing with raiding, 25H LK would drop Invincible and give you the Light of Dawn even if you geared up for him in heroics.<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't know for sure, but Blizzard certainly won't eliminate the grind; that is, new tier introduced: start collecting points from scratch. They won't do the same mistake they did with arenas originally, that is to let us bank points during a season to allow us to acquire the better gear once a new season tier goes live.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaba</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 11:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fully agree with this change.<br />
<br />
To be clear, to get a &quot;full&quot; set of frost emblems at the moment, you currently &quot;need&quot; to do:<br />
<br />
Dailies: (7 X 2) = 14<br />
VoA10: 2<br />
VoA25: 2<br />
Weekly Raid: 5<br />
ICC10: 30 (5 from weekly, 2 from each boss, 1 from frostwing trash)<br />
ICC25: 30<br />
Total: 83<br />
<br />
With the new raids lockout system, this is reduced to:<br />
Dailies: 14<br />
VoA: 2<br />
Weekly: 5<br />
ICC: 30<br />
Total: 51<br />
<br />
So, here's the prediction: the emblem cap will be 30 per week (by today's standards), or however many you can get from a full clear of the top-tier raid. This means that there will be no reason to do the dailies if you cleared the entire raid. Prediction 2: Doing dailies alone will get you to around HALF the cap. <br />
<br />
So, getting to that cap might not be as simple as joining a PUG. In particular, due to the new lockouts system, joining a fail PUG could get you locked out of a huge number of emblems that week. Instead, you'll want to actually clear the entire instance.<br />
<br />
Of course, if the new raids are gated, you'll only be able to access the first few bosses in week1 of the new raid tier. But, you'll have a very fast raid anyway, done in 1 hour if you're any good. Then you can call it there (won't be able to buy anything with emblems in the first few weeks anyway), or you can grab some guildies and faceroll some heroics (in which case you'll reach the limit anyway)<br />
<br />
Lastly, I'd bet that Blizzard are aiming for 2 nights per week of raiding content, which is mostly how long it takes to get those 30 emblems at the moment. So far they've indicated that they're going for smaller instances, ie. 4 - 6 boss raids, like SSC/TK/MH. So that's 1 night for each instance. Then hard modes for 3nights+ guilds.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patrux</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yes, it is. But if you're super skilled enough to get the highest tier already and be worried about this, you'll still faceroll them, because it ends up being a skill test rather than a gear test.<br />
<br />
If you got carried, though, you should be worried.<br />
<br />
How is it going to be a skill test if you join a battleground with 10-40 other people?<br />
I mean, even if you play exceptionally, chances are the rest (or at least a bunch) are still as bad as your average bg-hero today is.<br />
<br />
One could argue that the bg standards will be upped due to rated bg's, but that's hard to say right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How is that a problem?<br />
<br />
If you're a skilled player, why does geared scrubs worry you?<br />
<br />
Cause every scrub will look as badass as good players.<br />
Yes, looks/epeen matters.<br />
<br />
Also, every class will look the same since the best available gear will be obtainable by ANYONE, way to homogenize the game. As if it wasn't bad enough already.<br />
This really bothers me.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well i'm sorry to inform you but blizzard does not want to only reward the good players with the necessary gear to have fun in bgs and arenas.<br />
You know, it's just a game.<br />
<br />
If you wan't to brag, do it with titles and tabards and whatever...<br />

Why have gear at all if everyone will have the same anyway.<br />

(think of how much gear ToC25hc ppl needed from ICC10!) So, even less need to bother with 5-mans if you're doing hard modes.</div></div><hr />

i think the face of WoW is changing and i see it going in a good direction. im not gonna sit here and say all is perfect and wont go wrong but from my point of view it seems this game is going to be more challenging, but thats my theory.<br />
<br />
most of the people i know in game and IRL that have been playing since vanilla or even early TBC are telling me these changes are going to be great. i cant argue with that.<br />
<br />
personally in regards to badges, i hate having 5 different ones so consolidation is welcome.<br />
<br />
besides that people are going to have to take longer to gear up, which in turn means people are just going to have to be more patient.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">molinator</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't say much about the pvp changes. Weapons without rating will probably result in massive QQ from the hardcore, even tho I would say that it's a much needed change. Nobody really wanted to be forced into PVE to PVP, which is how it is currently. <br />
<br />
The problem with removing requirements from PvP weapons is that it implies the PvP weapons will not be of heroic raid quality, which is what the t2 (2200) weapons currently are.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard decides to remove the heroic-raid-quality tier 2 PvP weapons from the game entirely, then they will be pushing all competitive PvPrs into raid content. As it currently stands I can arena for every piece of gear that I could possibly need. This would be a step back for the competitive community that they have incubated through the fleshing out of arena and the improved MMR ladder system. <br />
<br />
The removal of t2 pvp weapons is not a good thing for the PvP environment because it will diminish participation at high percentiles. If PvPrs cannot have their weapons competing with PvE gear that raiders get and bring to the arena then you will see those who pvp exclusively drop out of competitive pvp due to the discrepancy. It's not fair for either PvE or PvP to have a weapon advantage at any given time. If I can achieve top 1% of the arena bracket, I well deserve the same quality of weapons as a PvEr who defeats heroic mode bosses that only 1% of raiders see downed. This is simply an issue of rewarding skilled players no matter their chosen paths. <br />
<br />
Blizzard knows this reward system for distinguished players is essential to the game and to remove t2 weapons from PvP would kill incentive to get to high arena ratings because you would inevitably begin to be ROCKED by players who have the time to do BOTH PvE and PvP and are skilled at BOTH. The two should be independent paths in the game, in which a player can gear themselves to the best possible quality gear obtainable if they distinguish themselves enough. They should not have to rely on the other as a crutch for weapons or gear. It should be an option (as with PvE trinkets for humans) but it should not be virtually required by means of giving away the best gear to only PvPrs or PvErs. <br />
<br />
And to clarify, I have no problem with giving out t1, normal quality weapons to every PvPr. It will encourage the arena and rated BG environment to flourish. But if heroic quality weapons for PvP become a thing of the past then serious competitive PvP in this game is going to decrease as a result - not because of epeen, but because the lack of high end weapons in PvP would put competitive players at a disadvantage to those who have the free time to do both.</div></div><hr />

If we use similar logic that players use to justify 25 man raiding giving better rewards because there are more people, couldn't you also argue that there are more people in rated battlegrounds so therefore they take more coordination and skill (not to mention objectives, as opposed to just kill the other team), and therefore should give better rewards?</div></div><hr />

We work so hard to maintain a great core group for our 25man raids but now I can see people not wanting to bother to keep trying...they would rather just break away and do it on 10man mode for same loot! It's alot easier to control and trust a 10man group than a 25 man raid so why would people bother to continue to work so hard for 25man loot if they can get same stuff in 10man raid? I know our tight-nit core 10man group within our guild that has run for 2 years now is something we look forward to each week. It is lot of fun and more relaxing than tryin to keep an eye on 25 people and opening up the Heroic mode and getting some nice gear has been so much fun! But the real sense of accomplishment comes from downing these bosses as a 25man group? It will be hard to raid as 25man group if people just say &quot;screw this, i'll do 10man and get the same loot!&quot; <br />
<br />
So I pay Blizzard every month and trust that they are putting the money into great design such as they have done with Icecrown citadel's 10 and 25 raids with the variety in regular mode and heroic modes. So now blizzard is gonna &quot;cheap out&quot; and not have to put as many resources into designing different loot and setting up the mechanics for both sets of raids! All I see here is Blizzard cut backs and an end to our 25 man raids and possibly our great guild! If anything Blizzard isn't releasing newer content enough but having the different raids to attend such as 10 &amp; 25 regular and heroic it keeps you logging on but I think people will get bored with the new setup.<br />
<br />
What's wrong with the structure you worked so hard to achieve for Icc? I think Icecrown raids offer the best variety in raids for all players and the difficulty level within the regular and heroic modes is a great balance! You have smaller guilds doing 10man Lich King and opening up heroic modes and the boring monotonous repetition that 25raids can bring after 6 months of raiding Icecrown is broken up with the desire to open up heroic mode and make it a whole new dungeon again! If it Ain't broke Don't Fix it<br />
<br />
This is nothing more than Blizzard &quot;cheaping out&quot; on us but charging us the same amount to play each month than before and at first I thought it was another one of their &quot;April Fools Day&quot; jokes!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">molinator</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 12:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the only thing i don't like is the dropping rating on items. it wasn't hard to get 2200 but i wouldn't like to see someone who is terrible and only does rated bgs to have the best pvp gear. i think an easy compromise is making 2 sets of pvp gear 1 for rated bgs and one for arena both being similar in stats but arena being a bit better seeing as how arena takes more coordination and skill. <br />
<br />
Well what they need to do is make a set of gear of heroic raid quality, and set it at an arena rating so that a similar number of players are equipped with heroic raid gear as they are with &quot;tier 2&quot; pvp gear. <br />
<br />
The problem with rated BGs is that &quot;rating&quot; will not be a distribution like it is for the MMR system in arena. Because it is forgiving (ie you don't lose rating for losing) then it loses its ability to map percentiles of players to rated BG rating, and hence it loses its ability to make a reward system that rewards a player for putting an effort into improving their game. All a rated BG system would support is the ability for the player to rack up X number of wins, despite possibly having Y&gt;&gt;&gt;X number of losses to equally skilled opponents. The numbers it produced would be meaningless. <br />
<br />
For this reason, if Blizzard intends to keep the philosophy of heroic quality gear only being obtainable by the top percentiles (and intends to keep heroic qualit pvp weapons), they must also retain t2 weapons for pvp, requiring a rating given by a MMR rating or similar rating system, which will inherently keep ratings from inflating and losing meaning.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we use similar logic that players use to justify 25 man raiding giving better rewards because there are more people, couldn't you also argue that there are more people in rated battlegrounds so therefore they take more coordination and skill (not to mention objectives, as opposed to just kill the other team), and therefore should give better rewards?<br />
<br />
<br />
pvp isn't scripted. av zerg anyone? in a 25 man sometimes people can just afk and get carried, and similarly in bgs people currently stand there and do nothing and are still able to win. can't really do that in a 2s or a 3s game and expect anything spectacular to happen.<br />
<br />
either way, not too fond of the removal of PR from items. weapons were the bragging rights. why else did you make 2 different tiers, blizz?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">molinator</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 12:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Haven't set foot in arenas for over two years, being able to BG although rated, my way to gear is the best thing since the vanilla rank-grind.<br />
That grind may have not been that cool but without a rating requirement the second thing to measure is dedication.<br />
<br />
BG's are back baby!<br />
<br />
Anyone who's happy with t2 rating-requirement weapons not existing for PvP'rs should be similarly ecstatic if Blizzard announces that all Legendary Weapons will be deleted from the game and no more will ever show up.<br />
<br />
There's a reason that PvP'rs want rating requirement weapons, and it's because they want a way to distinguish their characters from those who put little to no effort into actually learning. The same is true for all PvErs. We all want to be recognized for not freeloading, but excelling at what we do and to remove any type of rating requirement weapon from PvP gear is a serious step in the wrong direction for this game. <br />
<br />
I've made enough posts with the same gist but I'll stop there. The current reward system that equated heroic raid weapons in item level to t2 2200 rating weapons was fine. If this gets changed and PvP weapons fall behind there will be fallout in participation.</div></div><hr />

pvp weps and gear without rating? not enuff that any better pve geared nab can faceroll arena weps nowdays? so now they gonna give it to every noob who farmed daily HC and weekly quest enough long? srsly gg, time to think about quiting pvp<br />
<br />
<br />
Jesus, I hate peen kids like you. Honestly, if you want to flex your peen, you'll have your arena ratings, titles, mounts, pets, tabards, etc, etc, etc.<br />
PvP is about skill, not gear. I'm glad blizzard is moving away from stupid fucks like you.<br />
<br />
p.s. I really hope that's not you in that picture. HAHAHA.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard knows this reward system for distinguished players is essential to the game and to remove t2 weapons from PvP would kill incentive to get to high arena ratings because you would inevitably begin to be ROCKED by players who have the time to do BOTH PvE and PvP and are skilled at BOTH.<br />
<br />
All I got from this was, you're upset that &quot;bads&quot; are going to have access to the same gear as you, which is an equal fight gearwise, and you don't like that. But at the same time, you're crying because people that you'd normally be on an equal playing field with, are going to be better geared then you.<br />
Look man, either it's fair or it's not, you can't have both. Stop crying.<br />

I don't have a ton of arena experience. I do 2v2 with a friend, so I apologize. I wasn't meaning to discredit people who play arena in any way. It has its own skill set and people who are amazing at it, power to them. My comment was a bit sarcastic, though, because the post I mentioned is making assumptions of what rated battlegrounds will be like. We can all predict. We can all assume. But the fact is, at higher ratings in rated battlegrounds, I predict there will be less AFK-Allstars, BG Heroes, etc.<br />
<br />
While i do believe it's nice to have that &quot;unique&quot; shiny weapon or &quot;unique&quot; piece of gear, I agree with the sentiment that &quot;bads&quot; will still lose to good players regardless of what sort of gear either of them are wearing.</div></div><hr />

If t2 weapons are truly a thing of the past then it's a massive oversight on Blizzard's part. <br />
<br />
I have a inkling that they'll make some clarification about the PvP reward system that includes heroic-raid quality items to distinguished PvP'rs. If they don't it's a serious blow to my likelyhood to buy the next expansion because after the change to the MMR system, PvP became my sole focus.</div></div><hr />

You say yourself that people prefer 10 man, but do 25 man for the better loot. So what is bad about being able to do 10 man and get the best loot anyway? If you think 25 man has the better sense of accomplishment and is thus better then 10 man (you contradict yourself...), you can continue doing 25 man and get more loot, gold and points. I don't see the problem.<br />
<br />
Also, if the majority of your raiders prefer 10 man, you can go do 2 or 3 10 mans instead of 1 25 man.<br />
<br />
People seem to be scared this will kill 25 man guilds. If it does, it means people prefer 10 man and it doesn't matter that 25 man will die. However, seeing how many people are concerned, I expect all of them to prefer 25 man and thus 25 man will not die.</div></div><hr />

where do you get sigs like this one??? =o<br />
<br />
also i kind of preferred the idea of having to work (at least a little bit) through the content like in BC. now you can afk for 9 months, run chain heroics for a few days and go kill the LK probably when the buff is 30%. i like that everyone gets to see everything now, but it just seems like they could figure out a way not to make all previous raid content irrelevant. <br />
<br />
i just liked the feeling of &quot;oh i ran X now i get to go see Y&quot;, instead of &quot;X doesn't matter anymore lets run Y&quot;. nerf the old raids, make them drop more stuff, i don't really know i just don't like the feeling now. as i said nice everyone gets to experience the endgame, just wish they could get there a different way. <br />

<br />
Probably, but it will take a competent player a few months at most to be completely geared as compared to a non quality player taking 6 months or more. Also, if you take into account that the pvp season resets every 6 months, the competent player can use his gear for 4 months and the non quality player will be getting one set to turn around and grind for the next set.</div></div><hr />

I currently play at a rating where Gladiators are not infrequent, and t2 weapons are in every other match whereas I'm using a t1 weapon and a piece of honor (furious) set gear. Gear discrepancies of players even more skilled than I am at this moment do not concern me because I know I (and my arena partners) have the potential to improve. So why the hell would I be concerned about giving better gear to players who I know are more inexperienced than I am?<br />
<br />
If you want me to put my money where my mouth is, I am Molinator, Tauren Shaman of Medivh Horde. Check my match history in 2s and tell me I don't regularly face opponents that outgear me. This is not about concern for my own rating dropping. This is about concern for the top percentile of players above me simply quitting arena and destroying my ability to progress further in the arena system because of rating collapse in the top percentiles. <br />
<br />
In short - what concerns me is the favoritism in the reward system, and the hypocrisy of players like yourself who expect gear upgrades from progressively harder raid content, but expect PvP players to be complacent with no gear progression as they continually improve their coordination and execution in PvP combat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">glaigas</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 01:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">the reason i dont pvp is because no matter what you will get a full seasoned player of the current season in low brackets which makes it very uneven.. now the only reason to QQ will because the other player is better then you or the team comp works better which will put a lot more possibility on balancing classes as well as having actual good players at the top tier ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because being an overpowered class for that season should reward you with bis in slot pvp gear? I know for a fact that arena has ALWAYS been dominated by lack of class balance, and as such should have NEVER been the only place good PvP gear came from. If anything, I would say that BGs take more skill than arenas and that has been proven by the dominance of certain group make ups at higher arena rankings which have left many people with a bad taste for arenas.</div></div><hr />

E-peen? Maybe for some..<br />
<br />
However, for others - easy to get = either boring, long, easy grind or you get them fast = getting bored fast = QQ<br />
<br />
WoW is and RPG so a huge key element is improving your character by better gear, higher level etc. disliking and &quot;fighting&quot; the fast max level + jump into best gear fast style isn't wrong in any way. It should be about the progress and you should never actually get the best gear possible since that would mean game over.</div></div><hr />

I am a GO of a small guild of people who know each other IRL. We have a common problems not enough tanks. All we can ever run are 10 mans, rarely we can get the bulk of the guild together and run a 25 (like flame levi for the weekly etc..)<br />
If you think keeping 10 people geared and able to stick to a schedule is easy you have no sense of reality. We are all adults with careers who love to play wow. We have families and other duties that keep us busy.<br />
With that we work very hard and take our time going through content, all must be on their top game and we know we are casual. We raid on Sunday afternoons.<br />
Its not easy to get people together and to get the right group with synergy who work well together and can always be there and on time. But we make do, why should people who can herd more cats get more? We work hard to get stuff done. Why should we never be able to access all of the cool stuff?<br />
This is a game, one I love alot. If you think 25 mans will die and are canceling your sub cause of that YOU ARE THE REASON IT WILL DIE. Not me and my real life friends who work weeks to down a boss. When we accomplish something its an actual achievement, if you dont like the game go play something else. Its that simple.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 01:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is my understanding, not gospel of course, but I've read enough of the blue posts to think I am right. You will get Hero points for running Heroics. Like we currently get 1 Triumph Badge per boss, we will get, say, 10 Hero Points per boss. I believe there is a misnomer in calling the &quot;Random Heroic&quot; the &quot;Daily Heroic&quot; in this blue post. Previous Blues have indicated (and other information even in this post seems to confirm) that you will get Valor Points for running Random Dungeons. As many as you want to run will give you Valor Points every day. You will also get (more) Valor Points for running 10 man raids, and (yet more still) for running 25 man raids. <br />
<br />
There is a weekly cap on Valor Points though. Let's imagine a hypothetical situation (I have no idea what the actual numbers will be, and doubt even Blizz does yet). There are two raids at release, each with 6 bosses. Running 25 man raids gives you 10 Valor Points per boss killed. Running 10 man raids gives you 5 Valor Points per boss killed. Random Heroics give you 2 Valor points per instance completed. There is a weekly cap of 100 Valor points. You can chose to run both raids 25 man. You're done. No need for Heroics to reach your cap. Play an alt, get some sun, whatever. You can run both raids 10 man, but you only got 60 emblems. You can run Randoms 20 times to make up the difference, or you can just accept that you're under cap this week. You can run one 10 and one 25. Then you'll only need like 5 randoms to cap. You can run 50 Randoms in a marathon week, involving very little sleep. <br />
<br />
I probably have the balancing wrong, but the idea is sound. It will be possible to cap without setting foot in a raid, but you're going to run enough randoms to throw up if you do. It will be possible to cap with only 10 man raids, but you'll need at least a fair number of randoms to do it. It will probably be possible to cap with 25 mans exclusively, or with very few randoms.</div></div><hr />

I am a GO of a small guild of people who know each other IRL. We have a common problems not enough tanks. All we can ever run are 10 mans, rarely we can get the bulk of the guild together and run a 25 (like flame levi for the weekly etc..)<br />
If you think keeping 10 people geared and able to stick to a schedule is easy you have no sense of reality. We are all adults with careers who love to play wow. We have families and other duties that keep us busy.<br />
With that we work very hard and take our time going through content, all must be on their top game and we know we are casual. We raid on Sunday afternoons.<br />
Its not easy to get people together and to get the right group with synergy who work well together and can always be there and on time. But we make do, why should people who can herd more cats get more? We work hard to get stuff done. Why should we never be able to access all of the cool stuff?<br />
This is a game, one I love alot. If you think 25 mans will die and are canceling your sub cause of that YOU ARE THE REASON IT WILL DIE. Not me and my real life friends who work weeks to down a boss. When we accomplish something its an actual achievement, if you dont like the game go play something else. Its that simple.<br />
<br />
<br />
be prepard to be flamed for having common sense and reason. Welcome to MMO Champion.<br />
<br />
besides that, im not a casual player im moderate to hardcore depending on how busy real life is and all these changes coming makes Cataclysm looks so much better</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sparklelord</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I currently play at a rating where Gladiators are not infrequent, and t2 weapons are in every other match whereas I'm using a t1 weapon and a piece of honor (furious) set gear. Gear discrepancies of players even more skilled than I am at this moment do not concern me because I know I (and my arena partners) have the potential to improve. So why the hell would I be concerned about giving better gear to players who I know are more inexperienced than I am?<br />
<br />
If you want me to put my money where my mouth is, I am Molinator, Tauren Shaman of Medivh Horde. Check my match history in 2s and tell me I don't regularly face opponents that outgear me. This is not about concern for my own rating dropping. This is about concern for the top percentile of players above me simply quitting arena and destroying my ability to progress further in the arena system because of rating collapse in the top percentiles. <br />
<br />
In short - what concerns me is the favoritism in the reward system, and the hypocrisy of players like yourself who expect gear upgrades from progressively harder raid content, but expect PvP players to be complacent with no gear progression as they continually improve their coordination and execution in PvP combat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay, and as someone already mentioned, if that was the case then the top players would have simply stopped after reaching 2200 but guess what, they don't. They push forward to better their ratings and such.<br />
Also, I hate PvE. I do it on my druid sometimes to help my friends but that's about it. <br />
I PvP the most on my rogue, my only goal in arena each season is my t1 weapon, it's all I want because I know I can't get one from PvE. I PvP to PvP. I enjoy killing other players, I enjoy embaressing kids like you, I enjoy the challenge of an equal fight as I find they are the most fun. But hey, I enjoy rolling over baddies as much as the next guy. But no matter how fast I get my weapon or any other gear, I'll still do arena and aim for the stars because that's where the fun is, not in out gearing people.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry that you're bad. Hey, maybe when Cata comes you'll have a chance at being mediocre!<br />
<br />
Furthermore, I'll say my favorite part of WoW is World PvP which is basicly dead currently. I'm hoping some of the changes with Cata will bring it back or at least make BGs more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sally</div><div class="date">2010-04-27, 01:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMO, the removal of arena rating requirements on gear and the addition of rated BGs is going to completely destroy arenas. I couldn't be happier. In BGs its the knowledge of the objectives and the strategy involved that wins the match. In arena its greatly influenced by class imbalance. This change might actually make a lot of people go back to PvPing instead of PvEing as their play style of choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why would you be happy about that just because you like BGs better?<br />
<br />
Also, I reiterate, the removal of PR requirement on gear will have little to no impact on arena players past 2200 rating, as 2200 currently is the highest rating needed for any PvP gear (except for the e-peen tabard). There will still be titles and Gladiator mounts. Nothing really changed for most &quot;hardcore&quot; arena enthusiasts apart from the fact they can now more easily gear up their alts for PvP.</div></div><hr />
