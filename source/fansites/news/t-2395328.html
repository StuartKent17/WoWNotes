PCGamesN (https://www.pcgamesn.com/world-of-warcraft/wow-battle-for-azeroth-races) got to take with John Hight, World of Warcraft Production Director, about Battle for Azeroth. Here is a recap:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Legion threat brought the factions together, but now that it is dealt with the events of the Broken Shore are coming back into focus. The Alliance feels betrayed for losing their king and want redemption.<br />
Story arcs for expansions are typically constructed two to three expansions ahead.<br />
It hasn't been revealed how Battle for Azeroth will end and so players shouldn't make too many assumptions on where the story is going. There are many planned twists and turns.<br />
John believes even skeptics will come to believe that the faction conflict was a good creative choice for the expansion.<br />
You are not seen as an ally on the opposing faction's continent and it will evoke the feeling of not being safe when there.<br />
Scaling has brought some of the challenge back to leveling and given players a reason to level new characters again.<br />
The team wants players to pick a race and faction based on what they identify with.<br />
When creating a new Allied race, the team focuses on interesting races that inhabit a relevant area of the story, their natural tendencies and who they align with because of it, and balancing big tough races and cute smaller races between the factions.<br />
Zandalari trolls were originally discussed being rolled out at release, but the team realized it didn't make sense with the story because you hadn't gained their trust at that point yet.<br />
Legion races were made Allied Races early specifically to give players extra content to do prior to the expansion launch.<br />
Future Allied Races are already planned out.<br />
Players have gotten good at datamining content that the team uploads without the intention of immediately unlocking it. This could mean races that have been datamined (such as Vulpera) are planned for future Allied Races later in the expansion. The response wasn't blunt.<br />
The Mag'har Orcs received the different tribal skin customization to better differentiate them from current orcs while wearing armor.<br />
There are no immediate plans for Wildhammer Dwarves, but it is possible in the future.<br />
There are two members on the design team who focus on each faction storywise. They communicate daily to make sure that there is a balance on content and experiences without a lot of duplicating stories and quests.<br />
Alpha releases a lot earlier than in the past so that the team can catch things such as one faction not having a cool feature or weak pacing.<br />
Playing only one faction in Battle for Azeroth will still give you as rich of an experience as Legion.<br />
Each faction will have wins and loses, but these are battles and not the war. You will have to wait and see where the story goes!<br />

Mining While Mounted - Battle for Azeroth Beta<br />
In recent Battle for Azeroth builds, players have been able to mine while mounted. Players are not able to collect Herbs while mounted. It is entirely possible that this is a bug!<br />

<br />
Looks like that's pretty much how everyone's interpreting what was said. It's still highly suggested to read the original wording. There's a lot of fascinating subtext to what was discussed, such as 'balancing the number of cute or tough races between each faction'... Spoken in a way that could either be speaking of Kul Tiran or Sethrak for the Alliance side, heh.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zabatakis</div><div class="date">2018-05-06, 03:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vulpera were confirmed the moment they gave them playable race riggings. No way they don't use those assets to full potential.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathranis</div><div class="date">2018-05-06, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Then we consider what's their natural tendency - are they likely to be more sympathetic to the Horde or the Alliance? - and then if we noticed a preponderance of really big, tough-looking races on one side or really charming, cool, cute-looking races on the other, then we try to do a little bit of a rebalance.<br />
<br />
<br />
[...] it's hard to keep [planned Allied Races] from our players once we've uploaded the data.<br />
<br />
Those two quotes all but confirm Vulpera for the Horde, unless players have datamined some other cute-looking Allied Race possibility.<br />
<br />
Though, as already mentioned, I think it was already all but confirmed when they showed up in the character races database flagged with Horde character creation variables...</div></div><hr />

They should want retribution against Jaina for abandoning them and not teleporting them out then. The Horde sent out a retreat signal.</div></div><hr />

So where's all the changes to Alliance stuff? Pretty much everyone agrees the Alliance zones and allied races really suck compared to the Horde's. Why aren't they being changed, if Blizz specifically started alpha earlier so they could fix stuff like that?</div></div><hr />

LOL. They clearly are not playing their own game. Challenge, leveling?! In wow?! LOOL. That has *never* EVER been the case. The reason why casuals flocked to this game instead of the competition back in 2005 was BECAUSE it was so easy to level in. This game has NEVER had &quot;difficult&quot; leveling and I seriously doubt that was ever the goal. The only thing this latest patch did to the game was turning the game into a *tedious* grinding chore. It's bad if you've leveled a lot of characters before the patch, because then you know what you've had but no longer have. I'd say the leveling grind is about 2 maybe 3 times longer than it used to be. We're talking about *OUTDATED* content guys.</div></div><hr />

Truth is , this interview is BS cause nowhere in the Beta the Alliance is bringing the fight to the Horde to &quot;avenge&quot; Varian. They fight to avenge the burning of Teldrassil , and varian is just mentionned during those event briefly but is not the reason to go to war against the horde, the motivating reason behind the war is clearly teldrassil , not varian.<br />

Funny I thought there was only one faction conflict specific expansion (MoP) that has been released and the rest were about banding together and defeating The Burning Legion/Illidan, The Lich King, Deathwing, The Iron Horde and Sargeras. The only real conflict has been the faction leaders squabbling and the odd battlegrounds skirmish usually due to resources or like WoD, bull reasoning. (&quot;Oh the Horde are exploring Ashran! They must be up to something evil so let's fight them!&quot; &quot;Mon, the Alliance be attacking our soldiers in Ashran! We have to defend ourselves!&quot;)</div></div><hr />

The issue is not that mobs just have more HP. It's that they have more HP and there is no danger to them.<br />
<br />
It feels kind of pointless spending more time on a mob in the world if it doesn't feel dangerous. Some elites hurt but it's rare to see and some dungeon bosses do but with how most are tuned it's just turned quite a few bosses into punching bags.<br />
<br />
I think that if they want to increase the HP of mobs then increase the damage they deal. Right now it just feels like a punching bag in my opinion. I'm not saying make mobs 2-3 shot you or anything just give them a sense of danger in the world.<br />
<br />
The issue with that dev statement is that the only challenge in levelling is the odd elite which even some classes are still soloing. There is no challenge with normal mobs still. A HP increase alone does not make a normal mob a challenge if it's still hitting you for the same amount of damage before the increase. A challenge implies difficulty in killing it.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying the changes are bad per se but they aren't perfect right now and need a bit more fine tuning imo. <br />
<br />
However I agree with you. Calling for permabans over it is bloody over dramatic to say the least. As someone who recently did 1-110 it took me an 2 extra days at most.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL. They clearly are not playing their own game. Challenge, leveling?! In wow?! LOOL. That has *never* EVER been the case. The reason why casuals flocked to this game instead of the competition back in 2005 was BECAUSE it was so easy to level in. This game has NEVER had &quot;difficult&quot; leveling and I seriously doubt that was ever the goal. The only thing this latest patch did to the game was turning the game into a *tedious* grinding chore. It's bad if you've leveled a lot of characters before the patch, because then you know what you've had but no longer have. I'd say the leveling grind is about 2 maybe 3 times longer than it used to be. We're talking about *OUTDATED* content guys.<br />
<br />
And I have to say that from levelling 2 Allied races and a 1-110 recently no it's not &quot;two to three times longer&quot;<br />
<br />
Again people are blowing this out of proportion. It took me 2 extra days of usual playtime to get to 110 on each one. The only pain in the arse part is 60-80. Which can be invalidated a bit from 72-80 at least. 80-100 is insanely quick due to being able to stay in Pandaria until 90 and there is a decent method from 87-90. Hell I was 83-84 when I finished Jade Forest with a dungeon or two thrown in.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it's quicker but it's most certainly not as slow as people are making it out to be.</div></div><hr />

What exact method are you using? Because I've leveled approximately 25-30 pre 7.3.5 and having about 5 going on after 7.3.5 and there's a drastic difference between the two. Dungeon spam on one toon only (then and now) it's about 2-3 times slower. In the past I could get about 2-2.5 levels per dungeons with BoA's (all but pirate ring) now I get 50-75% of a level (with all BoA's + Pirate ring). Both sets include quests, it's a drastic slowdown.<br />
<br />
Questing is about 2-3 times slower as well. Especially in Classic content without flying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wonder if he is blatantly lying and doesnt care about that, or if he really believes it.<br />
<br />
First, it's not challenging at all. It's still the same faceroll, only now you spend much, much more time killing things. First levels feel terrible (as lev 1 pala with full heirloom, I needed to use Crusader Strike 3 times to kill a wyrm in BE starting zone), with levels it gets only a little bit better and normalizes on ~70 lev. Random classic dungeon is one of the most unenjoyable things, bosses take eternity to kill, but they are not threatening at all. Basically leveling is longer and much, much more boring.<br />
<br />
Second, people are leveling new characters mostly for heritage armor. At the begining of 7.3.5 probably many people were interested in how the scaling works out, but I'm pretty sure it's general knowledge now that it's worse than it's been. The game has 110 levels and rich max level content, no need to force leveling to be longer and duller.<br />
<br />
All in all, typical PR bullshit. And we are supposed to take what those guys are saying seriously?</div></div><hr />

<br />
But Ion loves the horde so much, i did expect nothing else.<br />
<br />
BUT that there are two separate teams working one on Horde and one on Ally story. It is more likely that we got the team less creative this time... and in any case, as a alliance player, our it is quite a basic boring faction!<br />
<br />
Probably it's more fun write stories for a &quot;chaotic&quot; faction than a &quot;legal&quot; one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Questing is about 2-3 times slower as well. Especially in Classic content without flying.<br />
<br />
For 1-60 I just nail it out with quests with the odd dungeon. It seems to go by pretty decent. I've found a good zone set to chain into is Silverpine, Hillsbrad, Arathi, Hinterlands and then Plaguelands duo.<br />
<br />
For Kalimdor I found Northern Barrens, Ashenvale and Stonetalon a good chain for lower levels as Horde.<br />
<br />
Basically the ebb and flow and speed feels best there imo.<br />
<br />
60-80 I go Northrend until 72 then do the Kara method until 80.<br />
<br />
80-85 I spent in Jade Forest and it went by pretty quick but of course it included the odd Mists dungeon which are quite short ones. 85-87 I did Valley of the Four Winds and 87-90 I spammed ZG HC trash mobs.<br />
<br />
90-110 just flies by due to bonus objectives in Draenor and Legion levelling not being changed much.<br />
<br />
So admittedly there are some let's say... unconventional methods and I imagine someone has found a quicker path than I but I found that path reasonably smooth. Northrend felt a bit sluggish but once I got out of Howling Fjord at about 63 it did go a lot quicker for me personally.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just personal experience here but I didn't feel it was 2-3 times slower. Admittedly not everyone levels at the same pace so I guess we can just chalk it down to differing experiences. I'm not trying to say I'm better than anyone either god no but I just didn't feel like it was going as slowly as people are saying.</div></div><hr />

No, they weren't. Vrykul, Naga also have playable race riggings. It's so they can wear player items like armor which adds for more variety/customization of NPCs. So they don't need to make a gajillion variable skins for NPCs like they did for Zandalari, Hozen, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Vrykul and Naga models only have support for armor. Vulpera not only have armor rigging but also have customization options on par with the playable races, IIRC they even have more combinations available than some of the classic races in the game like Tauren.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Makes sense. After the reveal at Blizzcon, they went into overdrive with Vulpera in terms of adding unique animations, face rigging, customization on par with any playable race etc etc.<br />
They probably weren't expecting the reaction to the race, seeing as how the original Vulpera (and some Vulpera NPCs) look very basic and baseline, AKA they use the original models.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
The Legion threat brought the factions together, but now that it is dealt with the events of the Broken Shore are coming back into focus. The Alliance feels betrayed for losing their king and want redemption. <br />
<br />
Yes of course, let's keep beating that dead horse. By now even the dumbest shit in the alliance should have heard that the warchief of the horde died again as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It hasn't been revealed how Battle for Azeroth will end and so players shouldn't make too many assumptions on where the story is going. There are many planned twists and turns. <br />
<br />
We shall see. The markething twats at our company have similar statements prepared whenever we ran out of iideas for new features in a product :p.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
John believes even skeptics will come to believe that the faction conflict was a good creative choice for the expansion. <br />
<br />
How? Why? When? The next &quot;Team up or perish&quot; plot is around the corner.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Scaling has brought some of the challenge back to leveling and given players a reason to level new characters again. <br />
<br />
No, heritage armor did that. If you actually leveled a character recently you realize that pretty quickly..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The team wants players to pick a race and faction based on what they identify with. <br />
<br />
Oh that is funny. There was an interview 1 or 2 weeks ago that essentially concluded with: Then the horde is there for you. What is it now? :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When creating a new Allied race, the team focuses on interesting races that inhabit a relevant area of the story, their natural tendencies and who they align with because of it, and balancing big tough races and cute smaller races between the factions. <br />
<br />
Cute smaller races? Does that mean vulpera confirmed now? Oh my.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Zandalari trolls were originally discussed being rolled out at release, but the team realized it didn't make sense with the story because you hadn't gained their trust at that point yet. <br />
<br />
After 3 Zones and exalted this should surely be the case, after doing the raid even more so. Surely there is no reason to hold them back any longer than that then if the lore is so conclusive, right? :P<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Players have gotten good at datamining content that the team uploads without the intention of immediately unlocking it. This could mean races that have been datamined (such as Vulpera) are planned for future Allied Races later in the expansion. The response wasn't blunt. <br />
<br />
Oh, is that now officially confirmed then? I guess that leaves the faction open..<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
There are two members on the design team who focus on each faction storywise. They communicate daily to make sure that there is a balance on content and experiences without a lot of duplicating stories and quests. <br />
<br />
I play horde an I'm willing to lend our guy to the alliance for a week or two. They deserve some better quests in BfA as well - and some dumb descisions from their leaders for no apparent reason ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Alpha releases a lot earlier than in the past so that the team can catch things such as one faction not having a cool feature or weak pacing. <br />
<br />
Ugh huh?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Playing only one faction in Battle for Azeroth will still give you as rich of an experience as Legion. <br />
<br />
That would be fucking sad! Because there was only a tiny bit in stormheim that was actually different. If 2 completely different zones amount to the same then they would have fucked up big time. I will be their marketing department for once and tell everyone here, playing both factions definitely gets you more than it did in legion. Even if this was probably intended to calm people down that fear they will only get half the content (in a very clumsy way), they are selling their own work short by doing that. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Each faction will have wins and loses, but these are battles and not the war. You will have to wait and see where the story goes! <br />
<br />
5 Gold pieces say that the alliance is definitely not going to suffer crushing defeat at the end of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

I think he means because they already had the variable npc models and skins, completed as far back as Blizzcon, and then they added the new player models a short while into alpha.

<br />
Pfffthahahahahaha, good luck with that.<br />
<br />
It's pretty much already confirmed that the Old Gods are pulling the strings in this conflict somehow. That does NOT make it a good creative choice.</div></div><hr />

The Horde abandoning the Alliance at the Broken Shore, which gets the Alliance &quot;super duper mega mad&quot;, and the next minute you have half the Horde leaders planning an attack with the Alliance and a shit ton of Horde and Alliance people in the same Order Hall.<br />
If they want the story to be truly great and make sense(!), they'll have to give the players completely different story arcs and quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah like Warcraft 3 where it was all Horde vs Alli- wait no it was about many more conflicts than that and the Orcs spent half the game being best buds with the humans. <br />
<br />
Oh wait, it was like vanilla where- naaaaa just kidding Thrall loves everyone and apart from AV PvP was close to nonexistent story wise, the only time they really interacted was when we were best friends and squashed some bugs together.<br />
<br />
But surely TBC has- you kidding? The factions were few things more than cosmetic during that time and you could even be chill with Blood Elves or Draenei regardless of blue or red allegiance. <br />
<br />
Well Wrath has some AvH action! Sure if you count a third of Icecrown and Wintergrasp I guess. Most of it is about actually interesting stuff like Ulduar and ye old Lich King. <br />
<br />
Cata however, now that's some faction war story! Well except for the part where we fought random Trolls more than the opposing faction, unless you really hated yourself and did Tol Barad a lot. <br />
<br />
Mists was faction war... for all of one patch, before that it was all about slowing down and savoring life, and afterwards we were off to kill Not-Qui-Shi-Huangdi and Orc Hitler instead. <br />
<br />
Warlords? Do we really want to talk about Ashran?<br />
<br />
Legion? Where the story was tailor made to make the factions as irrelevant as humanly possible?<br />
<br />
And so we come to BfA, where even as a ''faction war expansion'' we still spend the majority of our time helping trolls or bigger humans with their local problems and dealing with Old God shenanigans with the war mostly as an excuse for why we do these things, with some atrocities sprinkled here and there to make people on the forums rage. At least we get some PvE battlegrounds to remind us that there's an irrelevant war on every week or so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what's the deal now? Is there a sub-par expansion incoming or are we supposed to wait until the end to properly judge? Make up your mind :-P</div></div><hr />

With all you just spewed it still doesn't change the fact that the game is based around faction conflict.<br />

Funny I thought there was only one faction conflict specific expansion (MoP) that has been released and the rest were about banding together and defeating The Burning Legion/Illidan, The Lich King, Deathwing, The Iron Horde and Sargeras. The only real conflict has been the faction leaders squabbling and the odd battlegrounds skirmish usually due to resources or like WoD, bull reasoning. (&quot;Oh the Horde are exploring Ashran! They must be up to something evil so let's fight them!&quot; &quot;Mon, the Alliance be attacking our soldiers in Ashran! We have to defend ourselves!&quot;)<br />
<br />
Just because Blizzard is limited in what they can implement in game doesn't change the fact that the game is based around faction conflict either.</div></div><hr />

It does though lol. You can't just say &quot;the game is based around factions&quot; when people are correctly pointing out how little of the game actually cares about the faction conflict. Something can't be the &quot;core&quot; of an experience when 90% of the time it doesn't matter. I've played since vanilla and I have never cared about faction conflict and still enjoyed most of the game. Factions really only matter for world PvP and battlegrounds. Otherwise it's just Blizzard occasionally using it as a story point, often to the chagrin of a big chunk of the playerbase.</div></div><hr />

You seem to be confusing peoples interests with the fact of what the game is based around. It doesn't change the fact the game has been based around factions since WC1.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velerios</div><div class="date">2018-05-08, 07:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone in the beta, you are full of shit. Alliance leveling is fine, with many people agreeing that Drustvar is one of the best zones in the game.<br />
<br />
The only good thing about the zone is that it looks good. But questing is crap, sorry to destroy your illusion. No matter how good the zone look, when the questing is totally crap, then Alliance is not fine at all, it's bad, and how Ion is a hardcore-horde fan we knew since a long time already.<br />
<br />
No matter what i think about High elves (don't play elves at all), but to say that Blood Elves are High Elves, there don't exist enough High elves (blantly a lie, because there are WAY LESS Void Elves) and that the Horde are open for Alliance-players shows how he spit them in the face.<br />
<br />
So no, the alliance-leveling is by far not good at all, and many people are disagreeing with you.</div></div><hr />
