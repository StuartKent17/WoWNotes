The nerf to armor pen in 3.2.2 is intentional. Compared to the recent buff where we increased the value of armor rating to 125%, this nerf would take it back down to 110%. While we are still evaluating the effects of this change in the 3.2.2 build, we did want to let you know of the possibility in case you were about to spend a lot on armor pen gems.<br />
<br />
In fact, this was really the point. Several melee specs (and Marksman hunters) had begun to focus on armor pen at the expense of all other stats. Gear without armor pen was being passed over and gem sockets were increasingly being filled with just this one stat. While every spec has stats that are more valuable than others, this one felt like it was starting to trump everything. Not coincidentally, characters stacking lots of armor pen were starting to do more damage than their peers and more damage than we were comfortable with.<br />
<br />
This change is largely for PvE reasons, though we won't cry at all if melee damage in PvP drops a little as a result.<br />
<br />
We're letting you know now so that this doesn't feel like a stealth nerf, assuming it goes live. While you might disagree or be frustrated by the change (though I also suspect it won't come as a surprise to many players), we ask that you try and keep your response to something appropriate for these forums.</div></div><hr />

The real reason for this nerf is that in Icecrown we're going to be able to get real close to the hard cap without a trinket proc and that would just absurdly increase dps. I doubt 125 to 110 is going to make a huge difference though, people will probably just drop one or two pieces of armor penetration gear.</div></div><hr />

Not for many more months is it going to be taken out, so they can't allow it to be overpowered while it's here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It's not actually going to be taken out of the game.<br />
It's just being moved to a passive mastery thing in some talent trees. <br />
<br />
So while you might not see ArP on gear, it'll still be in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup - I'm sure the 'don't be hatin' people will post, but you (meaning Blizzard) really do need to be literally retarded not to have realized this outcome from the start.<br />
<br />
btw - the nerf doesn't change the fact that *at a certain point*, arp is *still* going to be better than any other stat - All it does is delay that point. Once you reach that point though it's still going to be an unbalanced stat. Players will still stack it above anything else until they cap it. Blizzard is just masking what was a design flaw from the start. <br />
<br />
Pretty much every patch has seen an 'oops maybe we shouldn't have put that much XYZ on the armor, let's restructure certain classes / game mechanics'. It would be nice if they could finally get it right the first time, so that players are affected more by the gear they get than they are by their spell coefficients constantly changing.</div></div><hr />

I'm affraid you missed point. They are not changing hard/soft cap, u will stay at same % as you are now. Problem is this stat won't incaste your DPS this much as it does now, so basicly with small diffrences between str/arp or agi/arp geming for agi/str will benefit you more from now. ArP was &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;useless&quot; stat back in 3.0.9, it's geting to same value now.<br />

They will still gem to the soft /hard cap then gem STR again or AGI again. Only this this change does is nerf classes that use it dps<br />
<br />
Well done blizzard, Check raid parses and see that in the vast majority of fight in recent raids Caster dps lol's Physical dps on the meters. This will further emphasise this gap.<br />
<br />
Warlock/mage lol'ing meters will return as MM hunters and warriors and rogues and Ferals will see a decrease in dps for no other reason that Pvp QQ even if GC doesn't want to admit it.<br />
<br />
<br />
personally i blame Priests and warlocks that sit on warriors forums and QQ about getting 5k Ms critted when the holy stars align for maybe 5s out of 60s.<br />
&lt;&lt;Arp trinket proccing with berserking on wep at same time&gt;&gt; <br />

You missed the point too. They buffed it by 125% from when it was useless, i.e. made it 2.25 times as beneficial. The nerf on the PTR right now makes that value 2.1 times as benefical, compared to pre-buffed armor penetration. All good in the hood methinks.</div></div><hr />

Why does their lead dev even post bullsh%&amp; like this? Every caster DPS stacks SP above everything, most tanks stack Stamina above everything, couple of healing classes care about nothing but Int, Ret Palas &amp; Deathknights go for pure Str everywhere... So what, if some classes suddenly start swapping Str for Arp, that's somehow a problem, but if another class values Str at a 1:3 ratio against every other stat that's fine and dandy? Okay...</div></div><hr />

You can't get 100% strength or stamina. But even this nerf won't fix the real problem. They're removing it though so it doesn't matter much.</div></div><hr />

He was right on point. They would have to change the %. The whole way this stat works is by decreasing the effect of the opponent's armor (as I understand it), so there is no way to just &quot;decrease DPS&quot; as there would be with Attack Power. Would have to be done through increasing relative percentages. This was a FUN stat, and making it not practical anymore will kind of destroy it and set it back to the AP grind it has always been. Way to destroy it Blizz. They're going to extremize it even more in the expansion. We wont even have to make a choice. All the gear will have exactly what every class in that proficiency needs, nothing it doesnt, and no choices to be made. Sad that's what it is coming to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
honestly, compared to ulduar drops, i've noticed that ALL phys dps gear in TotC tends to give arp at a much higher rate. As a rogue, 2 out of the 3 drops i've won so far have had ArP on them. So yes, whether you're gemming for it or not, you're dps will most likely go down if you're a physical dps'er in totc gear.</div></div><hr />

GC? The MM ArP stacking build existed well before 3.2. Even with this nerf, ArP will still outweigh crit at the higher end of Uld/Tourny gear even for SV, let alone MM. There's only one problem with ArP.<br />
<br />
That you need grim toll or the mjolnir runestone.<br />

There are 2 big DPS boosts from gear left for me, pretty much. One is a Tourny ranged weapon. The other is Grim Toll. Sigh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Negative.* You can actually hit 1231 ArP with ToC gear.* The value of a Runestone begins to diminish once you pass 566 ArP from other sources.* That number is easy to attain and in fact most hunters in successful raiding guilds will be well past that without even using any ArP gems.* I'm currently sitting at 521 ArP + Runestone, and of course the 25 man heroic loot has only just now become available. ArP and AGI for MM hunters has remained close even as people approach around 900 ArP...that's because the hunters who stay with AGI end up with significantly more crit and AP for Piercing Shots damage (and Chimera damage, which ArP doesn't affect).<br />
<br />
This nerf was needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let me disagree with you, Its nothing about &quot;cheapass&quot; players that do wathever it takes to be top dps, but only to help out the guild. So tell me if I'm wrong.

<br />
<br />
The whole point of DPS is to do as much DPS as possible to down the bosses without pulling aggro, how is doing this with armor pen &quot;cheap&quot;? If a feral druid is doing 7,000 dps with armor pen, he is still buffing the melee with 5% crit and 30% bleed damage, same goes for any other class using armor pen, they don't stop giving 10% attack power, or stop dropping their totems, warriors don't lose the ability to battle shout... <br />
<br />
What is your point? The only specs I can think of that are a nerf to personal DPS but buff other people's DPS are elemental shamans and demonology warlocks... but they still want to maximize their DPS as high as they can get it.</div></div><hr />

I love how blizzard says they don't like having a set of gear just for a certian class (IE holy pally gear) but they turn around and stack armor pen out the ass on mail gear, so Enhancement shamans get boned on gear choices.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right there, nothing to argue about your specific point. Damage dealers are for damage, and they should do whatever they can to get the most out of their class.<br />
<br />
But the thing about MMOs is: it's all about choice. From character creation to endgame. At least it should be... That means: I should have at least the illusion of a choice when it comes to gearing. I should be able to actually choose my gear instead of thinking &quot;oh yeah that's easy, I just stack [given stat], and everything else is just a necessary evil that comes on the gear but I don't really need it&quot;. I want to have at least the illusion of being able to make a choice, to decide whether I want to gem for Agi or ArP or whatever. I play a Kitty druid myself, I strongly dislike the concept of ArP as a mandatory stat. It should be something that goes on top, think of it as the icing on the cake. Something that prevents players from becoming frustrated with their &quot;gearing progress&quot; once they have reached all their caps and stuff -- but not something you choose above all else without even thinking about it.<br />
People have claimed ArP is not &quot;too mathy&quot; at all. I agree -- when you don't even have to weigh out what piece of gear you'll take because you know you're always gonna choose the one with the highest ArP... there's no math involved, true. But neither does this involve any kind of real gear evaluation, no real decision or anything along those lines. It's like saying &quot;yeah I'll just always take the item with the higher item level&quot;.<br />
And ArP has actually come to this point... Not saying it's not Blizzard's fault, it certainly is... but: You don't always have to sit out your decisions, you can revisit them and find out you've been wrong, and try to do something else with them.</div></div><hr />

There will always be a min/max way to gear your character. For melee classes that is ArP with lots of strength. Just because you dislike ArP doesn't mean it should be nerfed, some people dislike Agility, others dislike Haste, bla bla bla. The nerf will simply result in new spreadsheet formula:<br />
<br />
Gem Str up to X AP, then go ArP &lt;------ only thing that will change is the value of X (this is the icing on the cake, at least for DKs, nobody will tell you to gem ArP if you're below 6.2kAP raid buffed)<br />
<br />
Yes, melee is on top of meters for stationary fights. However you should check Arcane Mages doing 8k-9k dps, no melee is getting close.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deos</div><div class="date">2009-09-05, 08:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About time... Yeah I think it's hard enough to kill plates, but I too along with Blizzard am really sick of everyone just doing what's best and not what they want. I've seen Ferals with nothing but Armor Penetration and they were top guilded doing most dps, Blizzard is right, it's just doing too much damage. Now these cheap players will just have to gear up the normal way.<br />
<br />
A lot of people that cry about this, are the people that just do whatever it takes to do the best, and will say that's how it's supposed to be. Well Blizzard has been Nerfing and buffing things for years, all because of cheapass players that just ONLY roll with what's OP to EVEN it out for everyone else that DOES play what they prefer as a normal player. Like, I like to Heal as a Priest, obviously Shaman are more OP and Druids are extremely OP in PvP, but I still like healing with a Priest... because I just do. I'm not gonna delete and re roll a shaman or druid just because it's the most OP at the moment, that's stupid. Some people don't think so, and those are the same people that slit their wrists when they get nerfed.<br />
<br />
<br />
You must be a complete retard. There will ALWAYS be the best stat to stack to max out your DPS. WTH are you smoking dude? If not armor pen then next highest stat will take its place, strength, agility, whatever. This is the nature of things. There are no &quot;options&quot; ur talkin about. But with ArP being strong there were options. To keep the balance between soft ArP cap and agility. Now what the f' is &quot;cheap&quot; about knowing what's best for your class and maximising it? Wouldnt it be all reverse, being &quot;cheap&quot; is to play carelessly and stack whatever you feel like without even a grain of clue? Wow you are such an idiot, it pisses me off that people like you exist O.o<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm feral, and I don't see what other stat there really is to stack other than ArP. AtP? Useless for druids. Agility? Nice but not quite the charm; only gives the same thing as AtP and a minimalistic bunch of the crit druids already have enough of.<br />
Dude.. Agility is next highest stat after ArP and the highest stat before you hit the break point of ArP and get an arp trinket. It's not &quot;minimalistic&quot; crit, it's almost as much as raw crit rating for the same ilvl budget cost. And Ap on top of that. Plus your talents to multiply stats and BoK too.<br />
<br />
I still think ArP will be the way to go at highest tiers.. Like, i can already have 700 arp if i switch some agi gems back to ArP.. I will be stacking ArP even more after the damn nerf &gt;.&lt; This is quite annoying.. Just remove it for god sake from the game completely and replace with your beloved flat stats. So i wont feel like im getting upgrades only to get nerfed and kicked back to the same level, like that hamster running inside a wheel.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well deserved. I was already sick of seeing Warriors/and insane number of MM hunters, + with arpen gemmed. Yet another idiot that doesnt understand that if not ArP then another stat will take its place in most of the gem slots. Jeez..</div></div><hr />

Somehow i understand, what is meant. As an arms warrior, arp is great, even though i am greatly below the point where one gems for it. Its like &quot;fuck haste, get arp&quot;, which is somehow the opposite of my ret pally, who goes &quot;fuck arp, get haste&quot;<br />

As a feral druid i'm a bit worried. ATM i'm sitting around 560arp and if i have to regem cause it turns out to be not as good as it was before it will suck but.. thats the game. Nerfs happen gems/gear change and you move on. Just like the most recent Feral nerf. ZOMG 2% AHHHH END OF ZE WORLD! Yet my dps is still high and i still sit around top 5 on raids.

Apparently this was the whole issue. IMO players found something that works for their class, and blizzard didn't want these players to become too good at what they do. Blizzard is all over the popularity bandwagon until the player takes control and then its nerf time again. Just the way I see it. Blizzard's whole mentality is getting screwed up when they make game-wide decisions and major nerfs on whimsical feelings without any empirical evidence to support said changes.</div></div><hr />

This is still easily obtainable trust me it just means for a warrior for example wont be at expertise cap as they will have to use malygos boots instead of anub heroic boots.<br />
<br />
Possible to get 100% armor pen at current? easily Here (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Frostmane&amp;n=Yazuka). Proof of how good it works also Here (http://worldoflogs.com/guilds/809/)<br />
<br />
So best in slot setup for a fury warrior with 100% armor pen will give us 10206 DPS at current all it will really change is we lose some strength, crit and expertise to stay capped.<br />
<br />
TL:DR Armor pen will still be fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So this will just make Arpen even worse for class with less or no interest in it like enh , ret , none blood dk , mutilate rogue (?) and even more desirable for class who earn a lot by stacking it since you basically going to want more of it .<br />
<br />
On the top of that after being hit/exp capped you'll have the choice between gear with crit , arp or haste on it . Since haste is a terribad stat arp will still be the way to go .</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is why you feel like you have zero choice.<br />
<br />
Okay, in this case I'll expand a bit on my argument.<br />
The problem with choice is that we don't have a choice because people on EJ figure something out, and the majority of the community sees these things as set in stone (sometimes even because someone on EJ says &quot;this and nothing else, everything else is bullshit&quot; even when it isn't really). I personally do have a choice, but why? Because I'm currently playing in a smaller guild whose members don't care about 50 DPS more or less, because it's a very casual guild. So I really have a choice, because no one gives a damn, no one checks my gear, I didn't write up any form of application that had to be checked before I could get an invite. So as long as I don't start wearing my resto gear or gem spell penetration in my kitty spec, it's all fine, I really have that choice &quot;without repercussion&quot;. I don't have to fear not getting a raid slot, I don't have to fear my applications will be rejected, I don't need to re-gem, nothing.<br />
<br />
Though I don't quite get why you say that, for my concept to work, every stat hat to give the same benefit to everyone. No, only the ones that apply to the mechanics of my spec, why would spellpower need to give non-SP-classes any benefit? I don't want &quot;choice without repercussion&quot;, and I don't want &quot;choice without repercussion&quot; in its purest form. Of course I should suck when I don't get why I don't need spellpower. But I shouldn't suck because I don't like being limited to one single useful stat. <br />
<br />
To sum it up: The choice thing is one part a problem of clever players, one part problem of the road that developers took with this stat, and one part a problem that can be summed up with slightly variating your words: The community is too damn elitist.</div></div><hr />

Now these cheap players will just have to gear up the normal way.<br />
<br />
A lot of people that cry about this, are the people that just do whatever it takes to do the best, and will say that's how it's supposed to be. Well Blizzard has been Nerfing and buffing things for years, all because of cheapass players that just ONLY roll with what's OP to EVEN it out for everyone else that DOES play what they prefer as a normal player. Like, I like to Heal as a Priest, obviously Shaman are more OP and Druids are extremely OP in PvP, but I still like healing with a Priest... because I just do. I'm not gonna delete and re roll a shaman or druid just because it's the most OP at the moment, that's stupid. Some people don't think so, and those are the same people that slit their wrists when they get nerfed.<br />

<br />
<br />
It's going to be more complex than that, I reckon. ???<br />
<br />
Armour penetration will still be a beneficial stat, since the nerf (from 125% to 110%) is not too great. Calculations on the Elitist Jerks pages indicated that there was a point (around 600) where stacking Armour Penetration became more beneficial than stacking Agility (for hunters). That point has probably moved to a considerably higher value now, and even at high armour penetration values the difference between Agility and Armour Penetration will probably not be as great as it was previously.<br />
<br />
Stacking Armour Penetration will still be good in my opinion, but the reward will not be disproportionately better than stacking Agility or Strength. At worst, I think it will still be highly beneficial to stack Armour Penetration to the point where passive Armour Penetration + Trinket proc gives you 1232 (&quot;up to 100%&quot;) Armour Penetration.<br />
<br />
I suppose the nerf will result in more variety in how physical dps classes achieve their damage potential, with Agility and/or Strength stacking once more being a viable option at the higher end of the dps scale, but Armour Penetration stacking will not go away.</div></div><hr />

The nerf to armor pen in 3.2.2 is intentional. Compared to the recent buff where we increased the value of armor rating to 125%, this nerf would take it back down to 110%. While we are still evaluating the effects of this change in the 3.2.2 build, we did want to let you know of the possibility in case you were about to spend a lot on armor pen gems.<br />
<br />
In fact, this was really the point. Several melee specs (and Marksman hunters) had begun to focus on armor pen at the expense of all other stats. Gear without armor pen was being passed over and gem sockets were increasingly being filled with just this one stat. While every spec has stats that are more valuable than others, this one felt like it was starting to trump everything. Not coincidentally, characters stacking lots of armor pen were starting to do more damage than their peers and more damage than we were comfortable with.<br />
<br />
This change is largely for PvE reasons, though we won't cry at all if melee damage in PvP drops a little as a result.<br />
<br />
We're letting you know now so that this doesn't feel like a stealth nerf, assuming it goes live. While you might disagree or be frustrated by the change (though I also suspect it won't come as a surprise to many players), we ask that you try and keep your response to something appropriate for these forums. <br />
<br />
<br />
I underlined the important part.<br />
<br />
It wasn't as much as they didn't want you to stack 1 stat (while they probably don't), They felt the stat gave to much point for point making classes do more damage then they wanted unbalancing the game. So casters stack spell power a lot, we can still beat them in dps.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure hunters in general will be just thrilled to know that the spec where raiding consists of watching a semi-NPC autoattack for a couple hours will be back on top. Not to mention the plus of swelling up and turning red every couple minutes and getting a dildo icon over your head when you crit to indicate that your NPC is excited. <br />

hi can someone please pass my rant on because it seems pretty spot on....<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the only reason why they did was because it overpowered melee DPS in PvE. If it didn't I don't think they would have nerfed it. I mean oh noes they are gemming nothing but ArP! Lot's of classes gem only 1 stat because it benefits them the most. Shadow priests gemmed spell power and paladins gemmed int. ArP is a lame stat anyway. If it wasn't for people mathing it out for us we'd have ignored it still.</div></div><hr />

No offense, but in that case, the Rets in your guild suck. Good Rets are pretty much on the top of the damage meters (behind Rogues) as long as they can stick on the target to keep their SoV stacks up. It's just that way too many Rets suck at playing their class.</div></div><hr />

The AP that comes from sunder and talents/stances stays the same. so you will still be having around 65% anyway in raids. Btw - even at 110% its still more powerful that is was before.

Why then do top 20 scoreboards only show paladins on twin valkyrs (one on faction champs and none in Ulduar?)

At worst, I think it will still be highly beneficial to stack Armour Penetration to the point where passive Armour Penetration + Trinket proc gives you 1232 (&quot;up to 100%&quot;) Armour Penetration.<br />
<br />
I suppose the nerf will result in more variety in how physical dps classes achieve their damage potential, with Agility and/or Strength stacking once more being a viable option at the higher end of the dps scale, but Armour Penetration stacking will not go away.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yea, alot of people still say it will be a good stat even after the nerf, but the way iv'e always seen it, is, you still need a balance between stats, now people will just gem more ARP to get to the soft cap... hunters is around 788 next patch, which will mean taking out more agility gems... having high ARP, will then lead to having less AGI, and that means less CRIT and less AP, which is not good at all. ??? &gt;:(</div></div><hr />

They buffed it by 125% from when it was useless, i.e. made it 2.25 times as beneficial. The nerf on the PTR right now makes that value 2.1 times as benefical, compared to pre-buffed armor penetration. All good in the hood methinks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
fix yourself. its 125% of the original value. that's 1.25 times the original value. I don't know where you pulled that 2.25 times from but that's some new shit math and you're makin people dummer.</div></div><hr />

The balance is before you hit your caps. After you've hit those critical points, then its all about what gives you the most output per point and the balance goes out the window. For instance right now with my gear hit rating is about 2 dps per point until the cap. agility is behind that at around 1.2 and so on. Therefore stacking agility will give me the most return. Once the arp on my gear gets to a certain level, it will pass agility and once again I wont care about balance past that breaking point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Possible to get 100% armor pen at current? easily Here (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Frostmane&amp;n=Yazuka). Proof of how good it works also Here (http://worldoflogs.com/guilds/809/)<br />
<br />
So best in slot setup for a fury warrior with 100% armor pen will give us 10206 DPS at current all it will really change is we lose some strength, crit and expertise to stay capped.<br />
<br />
TL:DR Armor pen will still be fine.<br />

Are you going by before or after the armor pen nerf?<br />
<br />
Because before the armor pen nerf yes it was expertise capped but nowhere near 10% Hit more like 5% from gear, Shit tonnes of ap only came out at 5549 unbuffed.<br />
<br />
Also after trying with strength gems and mjolnir it seems to come out as more dps now though not by much:<br />
<br />
With full armor pen gems and comet's trail it comes out at 9654 DPS<br />
With strength gems and mjolnir it comes out as 9690 DPS<br />
<br />
So not much but still seems like strength is better now and only requires changing Collar of Unending Torment and Comet's Trail to Charge of the Eredar and Mjolnir Runestone</div></div><hr />

Why should it bother you what someone else does with THEIR character? It's people like you that make me sick with the community because you cannot mind your own damned business. What a melee class does for more damage is no more your concern than it would be theirs if you were a caster stacking SP.<br />
<br />
People that constantly groan moan and bitch about another person stacking a certain stat because its good at the time need to delete their characters, burn their computer and hopefully disappear for good. Seriously, mind your own damned business for once.<br />
<br />
As for this nerf, I see it completely unneeded. I don't see them nerfing Agi, SP, Stam, Str, or any other stat when its stacked over others. I don't see them rushing to nerf INT because half the holy paladin population wants to use it over MP5 or Crit. Heaven forbid a person actually had options when it came to gemming their armor. Yet it was &quot;Needed&quot; because blizzard said so. After all, EVERYTHING blizzard does is 100% right all the time, they NEVER screw up on their plans to balance the game ... oh wait. ¬¬</div></div><hr />

Not especially...the problem was blizzard apparently never figured out til now that players wearing the gear blizz put in TOC could hit the hard cap, without trinket procs etc. This is to stop that before it happens. It would be broken.<br />
<br />
To clarify, Im an Arp soft-capped MM hunter so I dont want Arp nerfed. However I think people are blowing this out of proportion. If this only means you'll need to up the rating you can still soft-cap with a trinket proc. At present, in my gear my stats started to get insane. Im currently soft-capped Arp, 5699 AP, hit capped, 48% crit. Self buffed. Raid buffed that's 58.8% crit. And like god knows how much AP. The problem is - at a certain gear level you dont even need to gem arp anymore, I have 568 arp passive and most of my gems are agil. Can easily re-cap that with the change by adding a few gems and some more arp pieces.<br />
<br />
In ulduar Arp setups were generally reserved for people with high enough endgame gear to support it, this will basically be the same situation. What it avoids is the ability to hardcap Arp at endgame gearing...10-11k dps on stand and shoot fights. <br />
<br />
During the time that my trinket is active, I can do (unbuffed, on an unsundered heroic dummy), with a 239 bow, ~6.5-7k dps. If I was Arp hardcapped (which is theoretically possible in 3.21) that would be 6.5-7k sustained dps, spiking with cooldowns and even higher with TOC weapons etc, and yeah - a ton more buffed and sundered in a raid. That would break current content.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree. I too am a MM hunter with the Mjolnir Runestone. With my current gear, I have 563 passive armor penetration. When my trinket procs, I have 99.7% armor penetration. Oh yeah. How many armor pen gems do I use?<br />
<br />
A whopping 4 gems.<br />
<br />
I have 8 other sockets.<br />
5 sockets with pure agility on them.<br />
2 yellow sockets that I gem agi/crit for their agility socket bonus<br />
1 blue socket that I gem with a nightmare's tear.<br />
<br />
With the way arp currently is, I think many high-end MM hunters have considered that they would eventually be replacing the Mjolnir Runestone with Death's Choice (ilevel 245/258) and prioritizing their gear for the armor pen HARD cap. This is why GC is exactly right. MM hunters aren't the only class either. We would be looking to prioritize armor penetration so highly to the exclusion of all other stats.<br />
The intent is not to equally balance all stats. That would be impossible without a complete overhaul of game mechanics. But I do think the intent is to keep stats relatively competitive.<br />
<br />
The one issue I haven't seen discussed - there isn't a trinket in current content that gives an armor penetration proc. Tier 7 - Grim Toll. Tier 8 - Mjolnir Runestone. Tier 9 - ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I tend to agree here. I think what they should do is simply run the x=y formula they will eventually end up running anyways and just take armor penetration out of the game now converting it to strength (plate) and agility (mail/leather). On off items they would convert it to whatever stat the item already had (agility/strength/attack power(x2)).</div></div><hr />

Now we know that Cataclysm is removing ArP from gear, but that doesn't mean that we will not see more ArP in Icecrown (Correct me if Blizzard has indicated that there will not be ArP gear in IC). Now imagine the amount of ArP that IC loot will have (if they do add ArP gear) coming off the bosses there. We are already hitting hard ArP cap with individuals in ulduar and TotC gear, let alone heroic TotC gear. If left to the current scaling, I'd imagine that it wouldn't be terribly difficult for people in IC to hard cap ArP to a potential point of ArP flooding (doubtful but a potential concern depending how sharp the iLVL increases are).<br />
<br />
At the very least, this may be blizz hunting for wiggle room on gear itemization on IC.</div></div><hr />

In order to know the reasons of a decision, it's probably more rationnal to ask the person who took the decision. Apparently they are saying that is was a nerf for PvE reasons. So until you bring a proof of the contrary, it's a nerf for PvE reasons.<br />

<br />
Indeed, before they increased the percentage of Armor reduction per point of &quot;armor penetration&quot;,<br />
<br />
15 % Arp (Mace Spec) = 231 points of arp<br />
5% crit (axe spec) = 230 points of crit (but you still have 5% crit damage increased which make it even better)<br />
<br />
After the &quot;up&quot; of Arp, <br />
15% Arp = 184.7 Points of Arp<br />
Crit unchanged.<br />
<br />
Now, they will nerf it (+10% instead of +25%) :<br />
15% Arp = 209 points of arp<br />
5% Crit = 230 points of crit (and 5% crit damage inscreased...)<br />
<br />
Maybe blizzard should look into this to balance the weapons spec, or maybe they want warriors to use just axes (which do improve more orcs warriors) or swords ( with the incoming up of the sword spec).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nurvus</div><div class="date">2009-09-09, 05:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He was right on point. They would have to change the %. The whole way this stat works is by decreasing the effect of the opponent's armor (as I understand it), so there is no way to just &quot;decrease DPS&quot; as there would be with Attack Power. Would have to be done through increasing relative percentages. This was a FUN stat, and making it not practical anymore will kind of destroy it and set it back to the AP grind it has always been. Way to destroy it Blizz. They're going to extremize it even more in the expansion. We wont even have to make a choice. All the gear will have exactly what every class in that proficiency needs, nothing it doesnt, and no choices to be made. Sad that's what it is coming to.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quoting this because it is in line with what alot of people think - and I disagree with part of it. I believe there are alot of misconceptions going around.<br />
<br />
You have &quot;fun&quot; figuring out what combination of gear/talents/rotation is best for your character, but pretty much everything is defined for you at the moment.<br />
All there is is a &quot;learning curve&quot;, a zillion ways to do it wrong, and a few ways to do it right.<br />
<br />
What makes &quot;ArP&quot; a fun stat? The big numbers? Feel of superior performance? What, then?<br />
<br />
Currently, ArP issue is a design flaw. Period.<br />
Armor increases Damage Reduction logarythmically.<br />
Let's say at some point you have something like...<br />
1000 armor = 20% reduction.<br />
2000 armor = 30% reduction.<br />
3000 armor = 35%.<br />

That means if you reduce armor by a whole 1000 the damage reduction goes down by 5%.<br />
Another 1000 and it goes down by an additional 10%.<br />
Another 1000 and it goes down an additional 20%.<br />
The growth in ArP effectiveness is exponential.<br />
<br />
This way it ends up either &quot;better&quot; and you stack it above all else, or it is not &quot;better&quot; and you ignore it completely.<br />
----<br />
<br />
What Blizz is doing in Cataclysm in itself - the &quot;simplification of stats&quot; seems &quot;stupid&quot; to some people, but I think it can go either way - it depends on what else they do with that simplification.<br />
<br />
Atm, I find it stupid there are &quot;useless stats&quot; for a class.<br />
Every stat should have a purpose, and you should have the &quot;option&quot; to choose your preference.<br />
<br />
Let's imagine for an instant that Intellect gave melees Hit and/or Expertise, Spirit affected Rage/Energy/Focus/Runic Power growth and that Stamina affected an &quot;Endurance Bar&quot; wich was spent by pretty much everything you do (Running, Auto-attacking, Skills, spells, etc).<br />
<br />
You'd actually try and find your own style of play, find the balance you favor, and players could actually come up with strategies beyond the use of heavy formulas...<br />
<br />
Atm all this game promotes is Theorycrafting and playing a spec because it is the &quot;best&quot; and not because you like it best.<br />
<br />
Right now you see questions like &quot;What is the best spec for DK DPS...&quot;<br />
Then you see answers like &quot;If you got X ArP gear, use spec A, otherwise use spec B&quot;<br />
<br />
Is that a choice? No.<br />
<br />
You go crazy grabbing gear to do max dps, then your spec was OP so it gets nerfed and now your gear is subpar, and you need to get something else to do max dps...<br />
<br />
Their &quot;revamp&quot; of attributes will contribute to one of 2 possible outcomes:<br />
- Blizzard destroys WoW with a silly brainless implementation<br />
- Blizzard actually makes WoW more interesting by having well designed - MEANINGFUL - attributes and a well implemented Reforging System + Path of the Titan + Talent Trees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Spellpower and Strength will be on all the relevant gear. It's the equivalent of your agility. ArP is a secondary stat like crit and haste, and casters don't gem full haste/crit gems.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Theslayer</div><div class="date">2009-10-14, 07:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No offense m8, but your guild is doing realy realy realy something wrong in raids if your paladins are first on dmg meter.<br />
Normal chain food is: Rouges/Warlocks/Hunters/Mage(they are allways near each other) then rest.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No offense, but in that case, the Rets in your guild suck. Good Rets are pretty much on the top of the damage meters (behind Rogues) as long as they can stick on the target to keep their SoV stacks up. It's just that way too many Rets suck at playing their class.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
...wow, i bet your spriests are right behind your retadins too, huh? the day i see a ret out dps me on ANY raid boss is the day i run out of arrows. GTFO OF MY ARP THREAD, LOLRET BUFF MONKEY.</div></div><hr />

You obviously dont know any good Resto Shamans do you?? Haste stacking is all they do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. Spellpwr is NOT the same of strenght. it's the same of attpwr. spellpwr IS a secondary stat like arm pen, crit &amp; haste . so casters are full gemming for an equivalent arm pen stat</div></div><hr />
