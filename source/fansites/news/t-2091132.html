Patch 7.0.3 Hotfixes - October 13<br />
Bonus Events<br />
<br />
Entering a Timewalking Dungeon will no longer clear any planted plants from the Druid Evergreen upgrade.<br />
The fireballs from the cooking buff &quot;Pepper Breath&quot; should now scale properly in Timewalking.<br />
Class Hall Set 6-piece and 8-piece bonuses should now scale properly in Timewalking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />

<br />
Ironfur no longer incorrectly multiplies Bonus Armor effects from temporary buffs.<br />
(Balance) New Moon, Half Moon, and Full Moon are now in the Arcane spell school.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Spirit Cauldrons no longer have collision.<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
Reminder: These changes are only active while in PvP combat situations and do not affect PvE. Many more Honor Talent changes are coming with Patch 7.1, including changes to Destruction Warlocks, Windwalker Monks, Death Knights, Balance Druids, and Restoration Druids.<br />

Frost<br />
<br />
Ice Form (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198144) now has a 60 second cooldown (was 45 seconds).<br />
Ice Form (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198144) can no longer be cast while stunned.<br />
Ice Form (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198144) will now cause the Mage to be immune to only stuns, instead of other unintended crowd-control effects, such as Paralysis.<br />
Frostbolt no longer deals increased damage in PvP (was a multiplier of +10%).<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Frost Mages are intended to create burst windows with Shatter and Glacial Spike, but have been reaching unintended levels of damage. By reducing Frostbolt damage, we’re reducing the potential size of Icicles and Glacial Spike burst. The Ice Form fixes should reduce its uptime, which was too high.<br />
<br />

Beast Mastery<br />
<br />
Beast Mastery Agility reduced by 10% in PvP.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: We’ve found Beast Mastery damage to be too high, but we don’t feel that it’s due to any specific ability or mechanic, so we’re reducing the overall PvP template.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Mistweaver<br />
<br />
Mistwalk can no longer be cast while silenced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Soothing Mist healing reduced by 10% in PvP. (Soothing Mist version of Ancient Mistweaver Arts is unaffected.)<br />
Soothing Mist healing cast by Summon Jade Serpent Statue reduced by 10% in PvP.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Mistweavers been one of our strongest healers. We feel Soothing Mist is doing too much healing per second on its own, making it so that the Mistweaver doesn’t have to use cast-time healing spells as much as other healers, even when their target is taking high amounts of damage. We’re reducing Soothing Mist slightly to address this. Mistwalk was never intended to be used while the Mistweaver was silenced or locked out of Nature, so we’ve fixed that as a bug.<br />

<br />
Pure of Heart (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199424) no longer causes Cleanse to incur a cooldown when it removes poisons and diseases.<br />
Pure of Heart (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/199424) no longer triggers when healed by a periodic heal effect, but will trigger when a spell such as Rejuvenation is initially cast.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Retribution Paladins are designed to be a formidable damage dealer and also have a protective, counter-control kit for their allies. Pure of Heart is intended to “soft-counter” poisons and diseases, but we feel it’s too strong currently when the Paladin is paired with a healing-over-time healer. Pure of Heart will now only trigger when a healing spell is applied, but not periodically during the spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Retribution<br />
<br />
Blessing of Sanctuary (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/210256) now has a 30 second cooldown, up from 25 seconds.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Blessing of Sanctuary has proven to be a strong, signature Honor Talent, but we feel its cooldown is too short.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Assassination<br />
<br />
System Shock (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198145) now properly requires an Envenom cast with 5 or more combo points.<br />
System Shock (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/198145)’s damage has been reduced by 20%.<br />
Assassination’s Agility has been reduced by 5% in PvP.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: The Assassination Rogue is intended to be a strong, persistent damage dealer that pressures targets but lacks the utility that Outlaw excels in or the mobility that Subtlety provides. We’ve been monitoring their damage and feel its higher than intended, and we’ve found some bugs with System Shock contributed to this. We’ve also altered their PvP template to effectively reduce their damage. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Outlaw<br />
<br />
Control is King (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/212217) will no longer stack Adrenaline Rush above a 3 second duration.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Control is King is intended to be an attractive choice for the Outlaw Rogue when within a control oriented team composition. This has worked out a bit too well. Now, subsequent procs of Control of King will no longer add to the duration, and instead will just refresh itself.<br />
<br />
<br />

Enhancement<br />
<br />
Stormstrike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/32175)’s damage is reduced by 15% in PvP.<br />
Heroism (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/32182) and Bloodlust now have a 60 second cooldown when modified by Shamanism (was 45 seconds).<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: The Enhancement Shaman is intended to be a formidable damage dealer who also provides offensive group utility through totems and buffs. Shamanism has been a popular choice for the Enhancement Shaman, allowing them to use Bloodlust/Heroism frequently and also in Arena combat. We like the utility this gives the Shaman, but feel its uptime is too high. Further, we feel the Enhancement Shaman’s burst damage with Stormstrike has been reaching unintended levels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's just a really stupid statement. Reason why those best mages don't play Frost is because those best mages always play the best spec. That's like saying that gWhiz just looks slow because no good driver drives it in WRC.<br />
<br />
<br />
If Frost mages were buffed slowly into being the best, lots of Fire players will be upset about the effort they already put into their artifact. Players will also switch to Frost, having it swing far ahead of Fire in logs and making it look very strong.<br />
<br />
So people who put effort into the frost artifact can go **** themselves because fire mages would feel bad if frost was actually competitive spec?<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is trying to avoid wild swings in class balance.<br />

<br />
HA! How about the mechanic that they can literally stand behind a pole an entire arena while they dish out 75-90% of their practically unavoidable damage? So tired of this trash.<br />
<br />
They need to implement some sort of fix for this garbage, like while you aren't in LoS of the actual hunter the pets move slower or something so you don't just get beat to death while trying to chase them around their pole (just an example).</div></div><hr />

I remember a time when flasks and pots and such were more a luxury opposed to a player imposed necessity. I always had and used em, because I like to go the extra mile. <br />

<br />
Its not an argument, its an interview. Both of those statements are pretty well self contained. <br />
<br />
&quot;lots of people like to play the best class/spec&quot; not a lot else needs to be said about this point. <br />

Well, I'm glad I saw this excuse coming with the AP system soft-locking you into a single spec. Sucks to be you if you picked the wrong spec too, since Blizzard is just going to pooh-pooh your experience with the tired old &quot;It's because good players aren't parsing on that spec&quot; line.

People play frost. Every spec in the game is viable for the basic content(mythic0, N EN, WQ, etc) but when you get into stuff like heroic, mythic, m+ you can't expect them to balance every single class because some people refuse to respec for that content. Too many lazy people want to do cutting edge content without using their brains. Same thing with consumables, they're at a reasonable price atm but people refuse to go spend an hour to make 20-30k or gather their own herbs.<br />

And they're not releasing too much up front. You do realize that Trial Of Valor is only 3 bosses, right? It's not a full-fledged raid. And it's being released almost 2 months after the expansion launch. Just because you don't like it, doesn't mean it's &quot;blizzard lying&quot;.<br />

His intent wasn't to say frost mages are better or even close to fire. If let's say fire is #1 and frost is #20, if the best players were playing frost in might be #13.<br />

While I don't think frost mages would jump to the top or middle of the ladders if all the best mages went to frost, there is some truth to his statement.<br />

I was wondering about this also. Do they mean, that if you get no loot, and use a coin, the coin is guaranteed gold?<br />
<br />
Or do they mean that if you use a coin, if you don't get loot, you only get gold? As opposed to AP, or potions, or something.<br />
<br />
It's worded pretty badly. But I refuse to believe that if you don't get boss loot, if you use a coin, you are guaranteed gold and not a possible chance at loot.</div></div><hr />

He probably means grind/repetable content. Because that's what WoW is now: a Diablo 3 MMO.<br />
<br />
Tons of quests during leveling were just fillers with no meaninful content on it (not even the amount of XP), then you get to 110 and start gated and the new daily system (World Quests) that people were calling &quot;Hourly&quot; instead of &quot;Daily&quot; thanks to the stupid fast refresh (3h,6h,12h). And they're mostly a rerun of filler quests and, just like Diablo, rare mobs bounties.</div></div><hr />

Frost can do normal content just fine. I think it's sub par in every way, but mage has 3 specs. Of course there is going to be one spec that isn't as good as the others. Play the spec you enjoy, but don't expect it to be good just because you refuse to play anything else.</div></div><hr />

Solution to Mythic+ :<br />
<br />
If somone LEAVES (Is not kicked) the timer stops, if you pull mobs after the timer has frozen, it starts again regardless of anyone joining or not. This would allow you to invite, summon and continue with no loss of time, and can't be abused by the party leader either. This wouldn't help with the people that alt+F4 or just decide to troll, but atleast the rage quit problem would be solved. There is no way to fix it really, without introducing more things that can be abused. <br />

You should just stick to going with people you know / trust and you won't have any problems.</div></div><hr />

- Yeah i always want to go for the bottom dps spec/class because that is so super &quot;fun&quot;<br />
<br />
Frost mage is way better than the numbers on logging sites suggest because a lot of the best mages aren't playing Frost right now.<br />
- &quot;LoL..&quot;<br />
<br />
If Frost mages were buffed slowly into being the best, lots of Fire players will be upset about the effort they already put into their artifact. Players will also switch to Frost, having it swing far ahead of Fire in logs and making it look very strong.<br />
- Then make Frost do 0.5-1% less damage compared to fire, too much to ask?!?<br />
<br />
The team is trying to avoid wild swings in class balance<br />
- Failed miserably<br />
<br />
Barrage<br />
- Got a MM huntard, lets not make this a bigger issue than it is, its fine as is.<br />
<br />
There are moments of excitement when a legendary item drops that you would not have with a more predictable way of obtaining them.<br />
- Lol right, that's why some people getting the crap legendaries are actually trying to vendor the items, as they are of no use.<br />
<br />
There are systems in place to prevent extreme bad luck from occurring<br />
- Obviously not pushed to the live game then<br />
<br />
The legendary items could be sold by a vendor and require some currency, but it would just feel like a long grind. You would feel relief when you are finally done, not excitement.<br />
- Then make it like wod, where its a questline requiring drops from raids, not just buying it from a valor vendor (although a valor upgrade system would be nice, given all this shit RNG everywhere).<br />
- You think its so exciting to _not_ get it everytime you complete emissirary quests/raids, not a legendary but got a 880 item form a world boss on my tailoring alt, best stats, totally cool item _best_ stats, except 1) I only use that char for tailoring (which is fucked this exp, so no real point in playing it), 2) That char does'nt even have an average ilvl of 800, felt exciting? nah felt absolutely shit to waste such RNG luck on that alt, while my main is strugling to get any item to proc.<br />
<br />
There is frustration when you don't get a legendary item and the team is aware of this. Many of them still don't have a legendary!<br />
- We know, it's clear you don't actually play much of this game anymore.<br />
<br />
There are some legendary items that aren't as great as the team would have liked.<br />
- No shit, you mean the items that are like completely pointless to wear in any situation.<br />
<br />
The rest of the zone had a nice ramp of difficulty.<br />
- Lol really, cenarius being the hardest boss in EN?, Xavius is just a push over in comparison (they all are but in relative terms).<br />
<br />
The way primary and secondary stats have played out is one of the regrets about Legion.<br />
 - No shit, if an item for my main doesnt have [Mastery&gt;Agi&gt;Haste]&gt;Crit (&gt; f... versatility), it's literally just going to the nearest vendor.<br />
<br />
It is fine to have a best stat and worst stat, but items that don't have your best stat shouldn't be worthless.<br />
- Then fix it, because right now they are useless.<br />
<br />
This is something the team wants to fix, but it will be done slowly and with plenty of notice.<br />
- Oh is that reforge i spot right there, nah it cant be.<br />
<br />
Item level should determine upgrades. This is especially bad with the personal loot trading system being based on item level.<br />
- Then you have failed misserably, still rocking an 825 item because _no_ better item has dropped (despite getting loads of items in the 850-865 range, _all_ with a mix of the 3 worst stats)<br />
<br />
In Warlords, flasks and potions were very cheap and plentiful, more so than any previous point in the game's history.<br />
- You make it sound like a bad thing.<br />
<br />
It's awesome having gathering being useful again!<br />
- Yeah its so freaking awesome to pick herbs, not able to get rank 3, not able to get more than 1 herb in suramar, if you even get a herb in the first place because of no rank 3.<br />
<br />
World Quests don't adjust rewards based on your loot specialization.<br />
- They are also completely pointless once you got the rep, and got past 840, as they dont scale ilvl either.<br />
<br />
If the map changed every time you changed spec that would be an annoying experience.<br />
- Not really.<br />
<br />
It also allows you to get items for off-specs without having to change your loot spec.<br />
- Because right clicking -&gt; change loot spec, is such a hard task<br />
<br />
There is no time component to how this works.<br />
- So you are saying there is no bad luck protection.<br />
<br />
If you got a legendary, you were lucky.<br />
- Strange so many lucky players our guild has, should ask for lottery numbers.<br />
<br />
A single digit percentage of people who got their first legendary did get a second legendary item, but it didn't have a big impact.<br />
- Not what alot of us are seing in game, but that's just RNG riiiight...<br />
<br />
There are no plans to allow you to move Artifact Power from one weapon to another.<br />
- Well you are really locking yourself out of fixing &quot;If Frost mages were buffed slowly into being the best, lots of Fire players will be upset about the effort they already put into their artifact. &quot; then.<br />
<br />
Artifact Knowledge and progression are working out well.<br />
- Might be working fine, but it's a system with zero excitement when you gain like 2-5% AP per upgrade item.<br />
<br />
Right now the bonus roll system can't give you anything other than gold when you don't win something.<br />
- Yeah feels so good burning 2000g to get 49g, atleast make it drop 5-10 runes.<br />
<br />
The system needs changes to be able to give you rewards like Artifact Power or other rewards.<br />
- Actually scrap the above, 49g is more exiting than a tiny bit of AP.<br />
<br />
The team is looking at the trinkets that aren't as powerful as they should be compared to other trinkets.<br />
- And by the time you are done looking at that, that raid will be obsolete.<br />
<br />
Unlike other items, item level is mostly the king when it comes to Relics.<br />
- So in essence you are saying you were talking BS earlier about &quot;Item level should determine upgrades&quot;<br />
<br />
Relics not being destroyed would lead to your bag being full of relics that you swap out, somewhat like talents.<br />
- That actually sounds awesome, ofc. you wouldnt stick around with 825 items, if you have 850-890 items around.</div></div><hr />

I think it's sub par in every way, but mage has 3 specs. Of course there is going to be one spec that isn't as good as the others. Play the spec you enjoy, but don't expect it to be good just because you refuse to play anything else.<br />
<br />
Why wouldn't i expect the spec i enjoy to be good? I know Blizzard will never accomplish the dream that all specs being equal but i am sure they also said there would be no spec that would be outrageously above another. How hard can balance really be at this point when we have so few skills now? I know it is my own fault for not jumping on the Fire band wagon but clearly so many people did the status quo will never change. Given the choice of grinding up hundreds of thousands more AP to play a spec i don't like or jumping onto another class i think it is time to bid my mage adieu.</div></div><hr />

It's like juggling 24 balls at the same time. You can't just watch one class and ask for it to be buffed, you have to see the whole picture. When one class goes up, other comes down.

Yeah, way too soon.<br />
<br />
They're using as base the world 1st clears of raid as a parameter again (just like they did when they failed at nerfing to the ground Firelands in 1 month after the opening because one guild finished it).<br />
<br />
Not good to not have a sensation of finishing something and just receiving more and more instead. People are trying to progress trough EN and then all of sudden, scrap that and go to the next.<br />
<br />
With the amount of &quot;neverending&quot; content like Mythic+, adding another mythic right now is kind of killer, the same for raid, when the next will only open in 2017...</div></div><hr />

You might be part of the very small minority that is actually upset about too much content, which is insane.<br />
Also, blizzard lying to you about releasing patches too often? get over yourself, obviously you aren't capable of thinking that maybe blizzard has a lot of content planned for this expansion. It seems blizzard has put the most effort into this expansion than any other expansion prior, so your argument of &quot;being lied to&quot; is just pathetic.<br />

Except it's not? It's a poor choice for Beast Mastery and for Marksman it's only really superior for AoE fights in Emerald Nightmare after the 20% nerf. Volley, which is a boring passive talent, does more AoE damage for both Beast Mastery and Marksman if targets are stacked (which they typically are in a Mythic+) and Crows is the best choice for single target fights hands down.

Really? Interesting concept. I hit 110 literally 12 hours after the expansion opened. Have been farming bosses, dungeons, etc like I've never done in an xpack before... at this point I've given up on seeing a legendary. RNG is all fine and good to claim as a culprit but when, in a guild of 100 people, you have 5 with 3+ legendaries (Some on alts, there is one guy who has a legendary on each and every one of his alts in my guild) and everyone else has none, you have to stop and wonder.... are they really that lucky... or is something wrong with their 'bad luck protection' code?<br />
<br />
Having been the first in my guild to reach 110 and the first to progress through most of the stuff, I'd say if bad luck protection was a thing, I should have seen a legendary item on one of my two characters, and especially on my main that I spend 3-4 hours daily just trying to farm for a legendary in dungeons/etc. Please explain to me why I have not. Am I really that unlucky? Granted, I'm not a hardcore player anymore and I don't spend every waking moment on WoW.... but I'd say this is ridiculous especially when you consider that the first legendary drop in my guild went to a level 106 that took another week and a half to get to 110. Why doesn't the RNG favor players that do put in the effort? After all, if bad luck protection did exist, shouldn't giving it more chances to drop a legendary also increase the chance to drop as you would be having a lot more bad luck than others who only play for a couple of hours/week? In fact, people that have seen a legendary in my guild seem to actually have better luck with getting more legendaries than others in that everyone in my guild that has gotten a legendary has gotten more than one. Shouldn't the bad luck protection reset if you're actually not having bad luck? I.e. the drop chance going down once you get the first to drop?<br />
<br />
Anyway, I digress. Pretty much what is happening in this case is that the more time I spend on trying to get a legendary, the more frustrated I'm getting when it's not happening. Good thing I'm not in a guild where we try and enforce ilvl as much as others... or I wouldn't even be able to raid which is probably my main reason for playing. Also, when they balance high-tier content on people having legendaries, it makes it that much harder to get the kills without said legendaries.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">unbound</div><div class="date">2016-10-14, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bring the player, not the class is a concern, but the game has drifted a little too far from bringing the class.<br />
The statement was made back during late Burning Crusade, where you needed a melee group. The Rogue needed a Warrior, the Warrior needed a Shaman, and then there were only 2 spots left in the melee group. This was a problem. Making buffs raid wide and moving away from mandatory interactions between classes solved this.<br />
There should be a reason to want some of every class or spec. If you don't have a Warlock in your group, there should be a reason to look for a Warlock rather than just any ranged DPS.<br />
Introducing or re-introducing abilities that allow you to fill special roles or give you utility is the plan.<br />
<br />
Good to hear that after many expansions, Blizz may finally be getting it. &quot;Bring the player, not the class&quot; is just as bad of an answer as &quot;Bring the class, not the player&quot;. This is one of the few things that may actually bring me back if Blizz gets serious about fixing that.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team is happier with balance than they were before the tuning pass, but there is still more work to do. ... Talk about Frost Mage as an example<br />
<br />
I would think the better discussion should be about Shamans. Enh kicks butt in both PvP and PvE...Ele is bottom barrel for both. That is the type of disparity that is unacceptable. Frost Mage kicks butt in PvP and is bottom barrel for PvE...at least there is some place for a Frost Mage. There is no place for an Ele Shaman right now.</div></div><hr />

Eh. It's nothing new. Ion's been like this consistently since I've paid attention to him - he's a trained lawyer, and he speaks like one - he thinks he's telling you what you want to hear, but we as customers parse words differently than he does. They plop Lore in every interview with Holinka, because his job is to translate what Holinka really meant to say - and they need to do the same with Ion. <br />
<br />
It's not like they're trained communicators - they're number crunching policy wonks and min/max elitists - their persepctive will never be yours, you have to try and parse what they say, and not be too offended when he reveals that what the devs give a shit about isn't what you do - and that they could care less what you're passionate about. They see the game as a never ending experiment, and if Frost is weak right now, that's perfectly fine with them, because they can change that next time.<br />
<br />
The overall thing I got from the Q&amp;A is they're trying too hard to control the player's experience, and dictate what the player feels at any given moment, regarding to success/failure. It's a rabbit hole they never should have gone down. I laugh at things like &quot;bad luck prevention&quot;, it's a meaningless expression. It's also not RNG. There's nothing random about it if they're programming drop rates. Anyone who's taken a statistics course can tell you that. Anyway, I just don't think devs should spend any time on what the player &quot;feels&quot; when they accomplish something - the &quot;yay!&quot; or &quot;Whelp...&quot; is entirely on the player, and you can't program for that - and it kind of astounds me that they are. <br />

I feel the same. WoW is full of these &quot;let us tell you how you should play&quot;-moments. I know it was never even meant to be sandbox-mmo, but even small things like &quot;forcing&quot; class fantasies on us makes the game feel like there's only pre-determined paths and you can do only things that developers chose. <br />
<br />
Things like &quot;suramar dungeons are mythic-only because you would be already overgearing them when you are revered(?) if they were heroics&quot; already got fucked up for me, as i'm playing this game &quot;wrong&quot; by having 846 ilvl from WQ's (and lucky couple world boss items tbh) and have gotten only little over honored on nightfallen rep. It feels like they meant i should have just unlocked suramar mythics instead of doing only WQ's. But no matter. I'm happy that i can do that at least. I don't really need to run mythics (though by not doing them i already lost few profession recipes but that's another story lol) if i don't want. WQ's are all i need for my alts.</div></div><hr />

Focus on their enemy, pinpoint weakness from distant, exploit that weakness. But it's what it is, and the dev's making this the way it is, are imo idiots for doing so. <br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So people who put effort into the frost artifact can go **** themselves because fire mages would feel bad if frost was actually competitive spec?<br />
<br />
You picked the wrong mage spec, everyone knew fire was going to be top at the start of the xpac, it wasn't a surprise. If frost was the best and got nerfed, you'd have an argument, but that isn't the case. If you don't like fire then you have to choose between performance and fun. <br />

I loathe arcane, but every time it's the top spec I play it so I can stay competitive.<br />

Checking in here as a top 500 world guild here, what Ion describes is exactly what we do:<br />
First couple of pulls we play without using flasks/food. If we notice we are getting mechanics down but the numbers are off we start adding flasks/food and if we notice we are getting sub-20% wipes we are asking people to (pre-)pot.<br />
<br />
Considering we have a guild who pays flasks/food for people and we dont want people to get burned out on farming pots every day, this is a compromise that works very well.<br />

<br />
Guy from my guild, I have done multiple mythic+9/10/11's with this guy where he pulls top (350-400k) dps sustained throughout the instance.<br />
He has stuck with frost when it was bad and now does top 10 logs world while being a ~400 world guild.<br />
<br />
So how about you buckle up and get good, if he can do it so can you</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isnt just the stats fault.<br />
<br />
If I get a regular 865 Crit Vers peice, my best in slot could potentially be a Titanforged Haste Mastery. The disparity between the stats is only further compounded by the fact that I could be getting so much better.<br />
<br />
<br />
When you are doing your first pull on a boss to learn strategy, is that DPS potion going to do anything?<br />
<br />
When a Potion of the Old War can do 10% of my overall damage. Yes dickhead, yes it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's awesome having gathering being useful again!<br />
<br />
Its less awesome having to drop skinning or mining because herbalism is the only gathering skill worth a damn.<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if you and your spec are good if the community perceives your spec as being bad, as it makes it hard to get a group. <br />
<br />
Thats because specs are bad at certain jobs and groups do not wish to make it harder for themselves to cover the job of lets say a Shadow Priest. Yeah, they may be great under the right circumstances, but if the other two DPS need to work that extra hard to cover, whats the point?<br />
<br />
Im not going to bring an Elemental Shaman over, lets say a Mage, because I dont need to make the rest of the group work harder to cover for the Mage.</div></div><hr />

So how about you buckle up and get good, if he can do it so can you<br />
<br />
You do realize that he has a best in slot legendary and perfect stat gear in almost every slot of his gear? You're saying that it's okay if an almost BIS 870+ilevel character deals 350k-400k (considering that he is running frostscythe) on aoe/single target, where other classes with weaker gear easily do the same amount on aoe AND deal a ton more single target dps with much weaker gear? AND they give you utility?<br />
<br />
The whole point is that even with best in slot gear you can only keep up with other classes (most of the time they also have weaker gear than you), not outright deal much more than them like you should in BIS GEAR. You can either pick frostscythe and deal decent aoe damage and deal much lower damage on single target, or pick a single target route that lets you deal moderate-lowish single target damage but completely cripples your aoe, making it useless on single target. We are slow as hell and have almost no utility apart from a talent that lets you stun some trash mobs at the cost of your damage CD (althought ill admit its okay in mythic dungeons, compare that to Shockwave). You'd think that having more damage than other dpses would be okay, but i guess it's not in blizzard's eyes.<br />
<br />
Compare your guildmate to a mage or a demon hunter with their best in slot legendary and also almost best in slot stat distribution with that item level. Then you will see what im talking about.</div></div><hr />

I call BS. Me, along with many many other players that have been playing since Legion launch, have not gotten a legendary. Yet, I have seen guildies that hit 110 and get a legendary a couple days later. Or I've seen people, recently that have gotten 1 legendary on a main, and another on an alt the next day.<br />
<br />
Their good luck does not have any impact on your luck. It's possible you not yet having a legendary still qualifies as average or normal and they just have exceptional luck.<br />
<br />
Perhaps Blizzard has said &quot;We expect people to have their first legendary by week 10 (which we aren't at yet), so after week 6 we will start slowly increasing peoples chances until they are next to guaranteed by week 20. Some people might get it sooner because they roll really well. However, eventually EVERYONE will get one. It just takes some time.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is a scenario where there can be bad luck protection and you can still not have your legendary. They are not mutually exclusive.</div></div><hr />

BUT MAN are you all a bunch of whiny little shits.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure most of you won't stop complaining until your specific class has been buffed to be the #1 specc at whatever they're supposed to perform at. People throwing tantrums like little children because they don't understand that not everything can be equal and that Blizzard is trying their best to level the playing field with over 10 fucking classes with so many speccs to deal with. Did you really believe that it was going to all be within tight 1% margins where it doesn't matter a single fuck which class you pick? Of course not because Blizzard opted for a route towards class diversity which made the game more interesting to begin with.<br />
<br />
And even then almost all the classes are within acceptable margins. There is plenty of room for you to develop your character and very few speccs are currently truly below the benchmarks they should be at, not to mention that those classes were recognized by blizzard as needing! <br />
<br />
It's just mind boggling honestly how so many of you like to shout that x has it better and you expect blizzard to change this when 99% of you haven't put in a single bit of effort to reach your potential. <br />
<br />
You use the 1% as a scapegoat, calling a lot of things overpowered because &quot;look at #1 guild in the world&quot; but they don't give a shit about underpowered classes, they're going for OP regardless whether they like the classes or not.<br />
<br />
The average player should be able to perform at a reasonable level regardless of which class you play. Undeniably some classes are less enabled than others and that's something worth being constructive about and making well-formulated posts about informing the community and Blizzard where the issues might lie but I guarantee you that they roll their eyes anytime they see another entitled prick whose post consists out of &quot;I am entitled to being the best, I have made no effort to be the best and won't inform you of how far I have gone in my attempts to do so but I feel like you should make me the best or one of the best regardless&quot;.<br />

TBH, I was reading it correctly, but misinterpreting part of it. The direct quote is:<br />
<br />
&quot;Right now the bonus roll system can't give you anything other than gold when you don't win something.&quot;<br />
<br />
I took that to mean, if the boss drops nothing, bonus rolls will only be gold.<br />
<br />
What it ACTUALLY means, is if you use your bonus roll, the only options are loot or gold. IF your bonus roll fails, right now the only consolation prize is gold, you can't get AP or anything like that.<br />

And it gets me pissed that some people are like &quot;ermahgerd legendz r totez rare and should be really difficult to get&quot; well, they aren't, when it's rng. Play 10 mins. on that fresh 110? Got a legendary. Farmed day in and night out, keeps up with everything? No legendary. Effort. Doesn't. Matter. <br />
<br />
Legendary is a quality rating, not just for rarity. There is not a single reason why the current abomination of a system is as it is now.<br />
<br />
Im playing unholy DK. Got the ring legendary, second best for the spec. Doesnt change a damn thing. It got nice stats and thats it. Even BiS legendary for me (bracers) doesnt make it like you sound.<br />
<br />
Which specs doesnt work without specific legendary?</div></div><hr />

Well the developers have never come to terms with the fact the player base does not play the game how they want them too or how the power point presentation stated it will be played. The developers and management have forever been frustrated by the lack of participation in PVP by the player base and forced it through Legendary quests in MOP and such, stuffed into the main meeting place of players in Legion, all so they can draw up fake participation numbers (hint, its not choice when you have to ignore good content to avoid bad game play)</div></div><hr />

The feral BiS comes to mind. And I said -some-, and -work correctly-. I didn't say they didn't work at all. Nvm that Blizz has said that raids beyond EN expects you to have at least 1 legendary. There are pugs and raid groups that will not let you in w/o possessing one already now. Class bias, blah blah blah.</div></div><hr />

i dont have any issues with the legendary drop system. My guild and all my friends guilds have been getting steady drops each week. Some have got 2 or 3 and some have got none, but many of those &quot;none&quot; last week got 1 this week.<br />

That comment alone makes me sad; guess I'll never get to DPS Mythic plus because it's fine with them that Feral AoE isn't remotely viable. How nice.<br />

There are a few specs that simply dont have interesting legendaries. Enhance has the Spirit Wolf boots which absolutely change the way you do Mythic Dungeons, but outside of that, theyre fairly bland outside of their stats, theyre fairly passive increase damaged done bonuses.<br />

Mages and Warriors I know have one that influence their gameplay with the execute and time warp legendary.</div></div><hr />

Thats not whats hes saying.<br />
<br />
Hes saying that the good players naturally play the better specs because they are expected to perform at a certain level in order to keep a raid spot. Its not acceptable in Mythic raiding to play Frost. Hes not saying the people who play Frost are bad, hes saying that the good players and the rankings and logs reflect this, flock to a certain spc.<br />

If Frost mages were buffed slowly into being the best spec, lots of Fire players will be upset about the effort they already put into their artifact and gear. Those players will also switch to Frost, having it swing far ahead of Fire in logs and making it look very strong.&quot;<br />

Yes because casual bad guilds who casually do mythic raids and pugs are not so reasonable to argue that dps1 who joined 4 months ago did so much better than dps2 who joined 3 months ago just because the latter one thought we are all on Ions level of rationality. Sorry, nope.<br />
<br />
Community, Raid Guilds everything is soaked in toxic waters and so much that you have rooted very deep into your guild/group to make such rationality work. That's where Ion still fails after all these years, same with Ghostcrawler who never accepted the term mandatory. People who do it won't just feel better, the ones who don't use it will feel fucking worse and have to have faith in 19 other people be as rational as them here.<br />
<br />
Fucking stop overestimating the &lt;top200 guilds already.<br />
<br />
This so much, my guild bases mythic raid spots on performance during heroic (among other things) if you aren't use 2 pots on every pushover fight that falls down if you just blow on it, then you won't get a mythic spot a lot of the time. I don't know where this idea that we never used to use pots every pre-pull and a pot during the fight before WoD came from, I certainly remember using 2 pots (plus flask, plus food) every pull during MoP and Cata, even when did so when I casually raided during wrath. I don't think potions have EVER been as resource intensive as they are now (provided I didn't play vanilla and BC). This ideology coming from someone who got his foot in the door at blizz from being an extremely high end raider and theory crafter is extremely disheartening.<br />
<br />
The fix for balancing spec within classes is pretty simple, make AP character bound, not weapon bound, lets stop punishing people for playing off-specs, especially for hybrid classes, many healers will go DPS as their group gets more gear and experienced with the content. I can see the idea of letting someone pick their favourite spec to play for the xpac (and I think it's good in theory). In practice though, a lot of times instead of being accepted they are just ignored for not choosing the &quot;right spec&quot; from the beginning. While it can be exciting unlocking golden dragons on an off-spec artifact you are penalised in the mean time. One idea could be to give off-spec weapons 1.5x AP gain till they are within X traits or X% total AP spent of your highest weapon.</div></div><hr />

It's MAJOR relief if you get the exact legendary that you were looking for, and infuriating of you get a shitty one. It's relief that your raid spot is no longer in danger or non-existing, it's relief that you can stop farming, relief that you're competitive again, relief that you are relevant to upcoming raids/content. And that's IF you get the decent legendary.<br />
<br />
It was exciting for people who got theirs in the first week. Then they were probably more excited when the bugged droprate gave them their second, third, sometimes fourth.<br />
<br />
For everyone else getting a legendary has been nothing but an exercise in frustration with the occasional relief. Nobody is &quot;excited&quot; by this system anymore. It's garbage and the devs that came up with it are idiots.</div></div><hr />

Im not refuting that at all. But that wasnt the point was made.<br />
<br />
However, what the original poster said, its just flat out incorrect.<br />
<br />
It happens every single tier and has been happening for 10 years. If X spec is good, the players play it. Simple.<br />
<br />
If only the normal and heroic raiders are playing Frost, WarcraftLogs is not giving a proper representation of their actual performance because the percentiles are out of balance.<br />

Well no, you don't &quot;need&quot; them. Farm more gear for a few weeks and the ilvl alone will carry you to victory if the fight isnt horribly overtuned.

<br />
Example, you have 2 relics slots that are 845 and 1 in your bag that is 840 and 1 in your bag has trait you want but you dont want to lose that higher ilvl relic to swap around the other 2 (hard to explain but i am having this issue atm..)<br />

Try telling the entire raiding population you dont need them. They are up to 10% of peoples damage done. You are absolutely kidding yourself if you will get people to stop using them unless absolutely necessary. With more gear comes a higher percentage of damage done through something like Potion of the Old War.<br />
<br />
Theyve been conditioned to use them since Wrath. You cannot turn around after 6 years and expect there to be a complete psychology change within a few weeks.<br />

I mean it would be retarded if they just went and said &quot;Lol you don't really need them so tough shit guys they're a luxury&quot; and to an extent they're correct but they're still trying to solve the issue with the blood vendor and seeing how it works oun, maybe it doesn't work and they have to do something else, who knows?<br />

Yeah, not even sure what you're trying to say here. The world first race is already over so nothing needs to get done. Progress at your own pace and if that pace involves the consumables then have at it but you don't actually need them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Murderdoll</div><div class="date">2016-10-16, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I mean it would be retarded if they just went and said &quot;Lol you don't really need them so tough shit guys they're a luxury&quot; and to an extent they're correct but they're still trying to solve the issue with the blood vendor and seeing how it works oun, maybe it doesn't work and they have to do something else, who knows?<br />
<br />
By the time the blood vendor comes out, the market would have adjusted itself anyway. You can see now the market is starting to even itself out. Pots are still 600-1k on Frostmourne but a far cry from the 2k they were 2 weeks ago.<br />
<br />
The vendor is going to come out in, 4 weeks (?) the prices will have equalized due to bots making a return and supply saturating the market and they'll pat themselves on the back for fixing it when in reality its 6 weeks to late and herbalists who sold up in the first two weeks are laughing their arses off.<br />
<br />
In the mean time, theyve just patronised the entire raiding population by saying theyre a luxury. Theyve made them mandatory.<br />
<br />
This is the heart phase on Ilgynoth for an Enhance Shaman. For our Warrior, it did 20% of their damage.<br />

The devs really should be looking at this, and just baking that 10% into the talents. It makes no sense. They claim they design the bosses without pots in mind, but they know guild require them. <br />
<br />
Pots are supposed to be last-minute, save your ass boosts for dire spots, or you've gotten a boss down to 2% and you don't want to wipe, or in more extreme situations make up for gear that hasn't been won by the player yet, or for curses and such that dampen dps or spell/action effects. <br />
<br />
They really should go back to vanilla, put long cooldowns on pots, and put that 10% into the spec, not into consumables. You have all this room on the talent tree now, too.</div></div><hr />

If they were serious about it as well as the &quot;too much burst on pull&quot; issue they tried to fix last expansion with trinkets and talents desynching theyd remove the prepot mechanic.<br />

He was moved to the WoW team during WoD, when the Warforged system, IIRC reared its ugly head. Either its a massive conincidence Diablo style loot made its way to WoW during his tenure on the team or hes partly to blame.<br />

Jay Wilson alone wouldnt have made the decision though, surely he was at the bottom of the idea chain. SURELY.</div></div><hr />

<br />
When your spec is behind everyone else on sims and needs that boost to be competitive enough to be considered for a raid spot, yes, the spec is broken.<br />
<br />
This is not even taking into account the host of mechanical problems with UH:<br />
<br />
-Poor Mastery scaling, a stat that was clearly designed for a talent that was omega-nerfed in beta (Clawing Shadows)<br />
-Ungodly amount of ramp up time on ST/AOE with the &quot;best&quot; spec, requiring wounds and DND to be present for AOE as well as the resources to take advantage of them<br />
-Heavy reliance on complex opener which requires precise timing for overall damage, which means that getting chosen for mechanics during that opener hurts us immensely<br />
-Mobility issues that require us to sacrifice our mitigation abilities for a small boost to Wraith Walk, which most people ignore exists because it sucks (see below)<br />
-Buggiest movement speed increase in the game that breaks on abiltiies, damage, and a random rock on the ground. Latter can be fixed...with a 7k gold glyph.<br />
-Raid utility was gutted; Gorefiends was made Blood-only and AMZ was made a PVP talent.<br />
<br />
The latter 2 points were hand-waved away by Blizzard, telling us that we were designed to be the hardest-hitting class when in range of the boss. Yet arms warriors (our 2-handed, plate wearing DPS counterpart) are head and shoulders above us on Ursoc parses, and don't have to sacrifice any of their mobility for that damage. We do have excellent mitigation, especially against magic, and we have a repositioning ability for 1 mob every 25 seconds (2 if talented and micro'd correctly). We have a battle rez. But those aren't enough reasons to need a DK in your raid when other classes bring similar utility with top-tier damage.<br />
<br />
Ion claimed that he was trying to find reasons in class design why you would want a particular class/spec in your raid or group. If that was the design, the team failed Unholy.</div></div><hr />

UH isn't in a bad spot. It still gets raid spots, still gets decent parses. Not every spec can be on the top.</div></div><hr />
