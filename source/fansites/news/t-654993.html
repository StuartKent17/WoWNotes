In addition to the changes originally listed in this thread, the following change was recently added and is now live on the test realms:<br />
<br />
Players gain a new buff after being launched out of the catapult that reduces all falling damage taken.<br />
<br />
We intend to make the following changes to Isle of Conquest in the next test realm build:<br />
<br />
Increase siege damage from Glaive Thrower.<br />
Increase all damage from Siege Engine and its turrets.<br />
When the parachute effect ends from jumping off the Gunship, players will gain a new buff that reduces all falling damage taken.<br />
Increase the timer before a Catapult without a driver explodes from 30 seconds to 120 seconds.<br />
<br />
It would be greatly appreciated if anyone who has experienced the following bug could provide us with as much information as possible on the circumstances surrounding its cause:<br />
<br />
Sometimes the Keep Cannons are being despawned and they never return. This should not happen.<br />
<br />
Given that the changes originally detailed in this thread are now live, we'd love to get feedback on your experiences in this new Battleground. Is the average length of each battle better now? Did the changes to the Huge Seaforium piles help address the overly advantageous strategy of capturing the Hangar and parachuting into the enemy's base? Do the Keep Cannons still feel effective now that they do less damage given that you can now repair them? Any information you can provide on your game play experiences will help us a great deal to make this Battleground as fun as possible. Thanks! <br />
<br />
Upcoming Engineering Changes - Updated<br />
Based on feedback in this thread about particular engineering items and schematics, we've made a few additional changes we'd like to share. Bear in mind again that this information is subject to change during the 3.2 testing process.<br />
<br />
World Enlarger: Cooldown is now 15 minutes, down from 1 hour.<br />
Mind Amplification Dish: A passive bonus of 45 stamina has been added to this tinker.<br />
Nitro Boosts: Passive bonus is now 24 critical strike rating.<br />
Frag Belt: The cooldown is now 6 minutes, down from 10 minutes.<br />

Crusader's Coliseum Audio Video<br />
Nakriel posted (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=70122.0) a really nice video of all the sound clips introduced with the latest PTR patch. Do not listen to it if you don't like spoilers, most of the events happening in the Crusader's Coliseum are featured, including a few bits about Arthas and Anub'arak at the end of the video.<br />

Known combat mechanic bug in current PTR build<br />
On the current PTR build, there is a bug with the proc code itself causing it to behave strangely. You are likely to see bugs on the PTR with anything related to procs. This includes talents such as Art of War, etc.<br />
<br />
There is an unrelated bug with Ardent Defender that makes Prot paladins more and more survivable as their health approaches zero such that it is literally impossible to kill them... though Chaos Bolt might work.<br />
<br />
Take any balance issues on the current build with a grain of salt. We will try to get a new PTR build up soon(tm). <br />

Stonekeeper Shards quest rewards and achievements<br />
It is intended that the quests that provide Stone Keeper's Shards don't count toward the achievement as the goal is to get the achievement by looting them. Yes, the text in the achievement could use an update which we may do in the future, but I have no eta on when that may or may not happen.

Allowing Engineers to change specs<br />
It's definitely something we'd like to do. We'll let you know when we can provide a better answer than this. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/15/18031369889-engineering-is-now-awesome.html))<br />
<br />

Warrior Mechanics<br />
<br />
There are some mechanics we'd like to change with warriors, as I have already stated. Having to spam Heroic Strike is definitely one of them. Rage starvation is never fun (which is not the same as &quot;I can ignore rage.&quot;) This is a slightly different argument that whether or not warriors have the stats they need to do the job, which seems to be the bigger concern in this forum at the moment. I am personally not particularly interested in who is the &quot;easier&quot; tank. I don't think any of them are significantly different from each other. You still have to know when to use your cooldowns, when to swap your gear, how to coordinate with your raid and when it's you that's the problem and not your class.<br />
<br />
I think it's easy to argue against your point that warriors have not gotten a pretty hefty overhaul this expansion. We changed the warrior Protection tree a lot more than the paladin Protection tree or the Feral tree. We made you press Shield Block less often and Shield Wall more often. We changed Thunderclap and Devastate and Shield Slam and so forth. My point here is: don't dilute your arguments. I hear a lot of players saying that warrior survivability is lower than other tanks. Okay, that is feedback we can use. I hear them saying, as you did, that some of the mechanics still need to be updated. That is feedback we can use. Saying you are neglected or somehow other tanks got more changes than you or whatever... that is hard to use. We don't balance around &quot;neglect.&quot; We balance around numbers. Theorycrafted numbers and simulations are valuable. Actual encounters with a boss are even more valuable.

China Limits Use Of Virtual Currency <br />
In addition to its ongoing crackdown on Internet porn, the Chinese government has declared that virtual currency cannot be traded for real goods or services. Virtual currency, as defined by Chinese authorities, includes &quot;prepaid cards of cyber-games,&quot; according to a joint release issued by China's Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Commerce on Friday.<br />
<br />
&quot;The virtual currency, which is converted into real money at a certain exchange rate, will only be allowed to trade in virtual goods and services provided by its issuer, not real goods and services,&quot; the Ministries said. The Chinese government estimates that trade in virtual currency exceeded several billion yuan last year, a figure that it claims has been growing at a rate of 20% annually. One billion yuan is currently equal to about $146 million.<br />
<br />
The ruling is likely to affect many of the more than 300 million Internet users in China, as well as those in other countries involved in virtual currency trading. In the context of online role playing games like World of Warcraft, virtual currency trading is often called gold farming. The most popular form of virtual currency in China is called &quot;QQ coins,&quot; a form of virtual credit issued by Tencent.com.<br />
<br />
Tencent.com, which has about 220 million registered users -- about as many as Facebook -- is quoted in the Chinese government news release as &quot;resolutely&quot; supporting the new rule. The government justifies its ban on virtual currency trading as a way to curtail gambling and other illegal online activities.<br />
<br />
The Chinese government, however, appears to be uninterested in regulating sales of in-game items for real cash. A report in the English-language China Daily says that in-game gear is not considered virtual currency, so selling virtual items can be expected to continue. The trading of virtual currency for real cash employs hundreds of thousands of people worldwide and generates between $200 million and $1 billion annually, according to a 2008 survey conducted by Richard Heeks at the University of Manchester.<br />
<br />
He estimates that between 80% and 85% of gold farmers are based in China.<br />
<br />
&quot;[M]any online games have a virtual economy and an in-game currency,&quot; he states in his survey. &quot;Gold farmers can play in-game to make some currency. They then sell that for real money -- typically via a Web site and using the PayPal payment system -- to other players of the game.&quot;<br />
<br />
Game companies typically forbid gold farming but committed virtual currency traders find ways around such rules. Some game companies have recognized the futility of trying to ban the practice and have built virtual commerce into their game infrastructure. <br />

<br />
Why's that? Folks have been asking for Anub'arak to be a proper raid forever. He's the undead king of all the Nerubians, and were it not for him, Illidan probably would have killed Arthas before he ever reached the Frozen Throne, and the current Lich King would have been Illidan.<br />
<br />
<br />
I really hope Blizzard makes Arthas unkillable... such a waste if they let us kill him and loot his ass. Way too much epicness in this shizzle, I'd say ;)<br />
<br />
Also, I'm pretty sure Arthas'll just leave like a pansy like he always does in all the quests in Icecrown, lawl. For an ultra-powerful lore character, he spends a lot of time sounding like a Scooby-Doo villain.</div></div><hr />

Good example will be Restoration Druid, you use Nature's Swiftness and gain the proc Clearcasting meaning you casting instant heals for no mana almost forever since the healing spells will proc Clearcasting multiple times so it won't run out, the only thing that can defeat you is stuns at that points (it won't work if the druid already procced Living Seed which heals you when you take damage, and also is bugged since its supposed to disappear after taking dmg one time so it heals you all hits you take until duration is gone)</div></div><hr />

He talks if you're Horde, apparently. If you're Horde you don't fight him.<br />
<br />
It sounds kind of farfetched, but what if both Garrosh and Varian died in the Coliseum? For example, if you're Horde, you fight and kill Varian (as shown by Tirion's speech, something bad happens after the fight) and then Garrosh dies later on, perhaps by attacking Arthas when he appears and failing. The event would be reversed for Alliance.<br />
<br />
It's just speculation, though, and it seems kind of silly that they'd randomly kill two characters they've been promoting (though in a pretty bad image) so much lately.</div></div><hr />

I agree on that, they have been pushing both of them into the spotlight alot lately.<br />
<br />
Seems like alot of effort for something peaking so soon.<br />
<br />
Afterall, they are the sceptic ones, if they are gone the horde and alliance will be all flowers and bunnies, which I, personally wouldnt mind :&gt;.<br />
<br />
Common threat and all, lay down your hatred and fight alongside like brothers and sisters.<br />

It is spoken at the end of the Battle for Undercity, when the Horde shuts down the portals - as such, ONLY Horde get to hear that particular soundfile when doing the questchain, since Alliance runs in shortly afterwards.<br />
<br />
So this actually means sargeras &quot;forced&quot; varimathras to &quot;betray&quot; the forsaken and make the new plague we saw at wrath gate?. could this be a hint to the next expansion where we will fight sargeras? could aswell have something to do with icecrown citadel.. time will tell..</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sounds kind of farfetched, but what if both Garrosh and Varian died in the Coliseum? For example, if you're Horde, you fight and kill Varian (as shown by Tirion's speech, something bad happens after the fight) and then Garrosh dies later on, perhaps by attacking Arthas when he appears and failing. The event would be reversed for Alliance.<br />
<br />
It's just speculation, though, and it seems kind of silly that they'd randomly kill two characters they've been promoting (though in a pretty bad image) so much lately.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, the assumption that Garrosh dies comes from the fact he has a death voice file. But many bosses that don't actually die also have death voice files.<br />

Because he doesn't want his dog (Garrosh) to start destroying human outposts and chewing gnomes. This way, if Garrosh does something wrong, Thrall is there to smack him down. <br />

This new regulation IS NOT directed at video game gold farming studios and such. It forbids issuers of virtual currency from trading real life goods for in game currency, thus promote a virtual economy outside of government's control. <br />
<br />
A example would make this a lot easier to understand. <br />
<br />
Basically lets say if Blizzard allows players to buy real life stuff, like maybe t-shirt, hat, snacks, or even electronics with World of Warcraft gold, WoW gold all of a sudden will have values like real currency such as RMB or the dollar. Basically Blizzard would be a retailer under the disguise of video game company, and they would be able to control their own currency without government interference. <br />
<br />
This is what this new Chinese regulation forbids, it only forbids the ISSUER of virtual currency from trading it for real life stuff. It didn't mention anything regarding gold selling by other studios. <br />
<br />
This actually is a pretty big problem right now on Chinese internet. A example is the QQ coin, which you can buy with real life money straight from the issuer, then trade it for service or real life items. Due to lack of regulation, companies can easily exploit both end users and the government in this situation. <br />
<br />
The author of that article probably didn't read much into the regulation and just assumed it was about gold selling.</div></div><hr />

and just for the next comments saying that Tichondrius was vanquished by illidan after he consumed the Skull of Gul'dan well this is your Answer from Wowwiki on the Nathrezim Page :<br />
In the case of nathrezim, it should be noted that they posses the ability to reform themselves after being defeated (in some situations), to that end certain terms should be given context-specific meanings for the purpose of explaining this ability. To &quot;kill&quot; a dreadlord typically implies that their body is slain but their spirit endures, capable of regenerating its lost physical form after a particular amount of time or some other condition has been met. The complete eradication of a dreadlord, both in body and spirit, is generally thought of as &quot;destroyed&quot;, representing a final end to their existence in both forms. <br />
<br />

So for example EVE Online allows you to buy time-cards with in-game currency. This would be considered illegal under the new Chinese regulations? Or does it have to be something like real-life items like your examples of shirts and hats?</div></div><hr />

WoW has been on it's path to its death bed for a while now. With the extensive nerfs to the leveling system and endgame bosses. There is is no epic feeling that players who played even three years ago got while leveling and completing the Defias quest line or other quest lines for the first time. Most of WoW's player base was goldfarmers in china since their economy and government suck so much that it is VERY hard to earn a living. I predict a cancellation of at LEAST 3-4 million accounts from the total 11million people that WoW has Platued at. Now is the time for another new game to take over WoW's player base very soon in one big sweep. WoW is on it's knees after what the Chinese government has done.</div></div><hr />

I had to make an account to reply to this...3-4 milion gold farmers? Where did you invent such a number??<br />
<br />
Do you realize how ridiculous your statement is? one every 3 players is a gold farmer? Even if all players buy to a chinese farmer....each seller would have TWO clients!! <br />
<br />
A quick Google tells me that 1000gold is 10 $.....just think for a minute the cost of the computer, electricity, server which to sell the wow gold, monthly wow fee and you will have that both clients must regularly buy thousands of gold each month...ridiculous!<br />
<br />
Two other comments to your statement:<br />
<br />
-As said above...China does not forbid selling digital money for real money...what it forbids is the opposite: being able to trade digital money for real life goods. <br />
<br />
-The number of wow players grows everyday. In general &quot;hardcore&quot; players do not like the game being so easy, while &quot;casual&quot; players like it that way. However, since the number of casuals is way more than the number of hardcore ones (how many people raid regularly and how many people do not?)...blizzard is going in the good direction<br />
<br />

That's like saying a 21-yr old dude has been on his path to his death bed for a while now... yeah, 21 years or so out of 75-80. Sure he drinks a lot of booze and sleeps around a lot more than he used to, he's not quite as cute and innocent as he was at 4, but any rumors of his imminent demise would be greatly exaggerated.<br />
<br />
More specifically to your example... the Wrath Gate chain in Dragonblight, Mayan god quest chains in Zul'Drak, and Argent Crusade/Knights of Ebon Hold chains each completely overshadowed every questing storyline in Vanilla and TBC. The closest approach to that point was probably the Thrall-Garrosh reunion in Nagrand for the horde only. Some of the older stuff was &quot;decent&quot;, but not anywhere near the same level of originality among the actual component quests. The game didnt even have the internal coding tech available in Vanilla and TBC to support that level of depth and variety. You are certainly entitled to any nostalgia you may feel for the &quot;good ol' days&quot;, but don't presume that the game itself is somehow lesser today--far from it.</div></div><hr />

Yeap compared to vanilla and TBC, questing in Wotlk is a hell of alot better. I really enjoyed questing there and was actually reading the quests instead of just zerging through lvling like i did with vanilla and tbc (the quest lore in wotlk is way much better).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In fact, older stuff wasn't decent. It was on par with what we have today.<br />
<br />
You're mistakin &quot;long quests&quot; with &quot;good quests&quot;. Northrend have tons of long chains, but far from &quot;tons of awesome long chains&quot;. Icecrown have some really boring (to not say with &quot;stupid objectives&quot;) ones that are part of a huge quest chain that should lead to Icecrown raid (Thassarian quests for alliance/Koltira for horde).<br />
<br />
In WotLK, most of the dungeon quests you get right at the door while in WoW/TBC you would do some really nice chain showing everything about that place most of the time. You had quests that lead you to raids, etc.<br />
<br />
So, again, In WotLK you have tons of long quest chains, but its far from that when you look at the good/awesome ones.<br />

You probably think they're better because we can solo almost all of the group quests (even G5 ones). Where in vanilla/tbc you would really need at least one or two partners, that &quot;grouping&quot; adds a lot to the &quot;epicness&quot; of said quests.</div></div><hr />

Anyway. It looks like the Burning Legion has a small spot in WotLK raiding content. Gotta love those guys.</div></div><hr />

You're mistakin &quot;long quests&quot; with &quot;good quests&quot;. Northrend have tons of long chains, but far from &quot;tons of awesome long chains&quot;. Icecrown have some really boring (to not say with &quot;stupid objectives&quot;) ones that are part of a huge quest chain that should lead to Icecrown raid (Thassarian quests for alliance/Koltira for horde).<br />
<br />
In WotLK, most of the dungeon quests you get right at the door while in WoW/TBC you would do some really nice chain showing everything about that place most of the time. You had quests that lead you to raids, etc.<br />
<br />
So, again, In WotLK you have tons of long quest chains, but its far from that when you look at the good/awesome ones.<br />

Dude seriously wotlk questing is far superior. Vanilla has alot traveling alot and BC had the quests more clump together. Both of them felt like missions that you had no idea or why you were doing it(you were only doing them for exp). In Wotlk i remember when i found out that humans were the evolved form of vykrul and then also seeing the lich king there to kill me. In Grizzly hills i remember that funny outhouse quest and when some type of undead were pretending to be humans quests, I also remeber the drakuru quests when you had to pretend you were undead and find out his plans. The icecrown quests when you found the lich king heart and then fight illidan as the lich king and also when the lich king and Tyrion faced off each other when you had to pretend you were with the cult of the damned. And dont forget the DK quests.</div></div><hr />

It's no mistake, and I will never claim that all chains are awesome. I did claim that the better ones far exceeded anything in TBC and Vanilla in terms of imaginative goals and entertainment factor.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Some are, some arent. Drak'Therion Keep, Gundrak and Halls of Lightning come to mind immediately as having a main quest derive from a long chain of quests and backstory. Not having to haul ass over 6 zones on two continents (yes ZF, Uldaman, RFD and the ridiculous attunements... I'm thinking of you) is a significant improvement over Vanilla. They didn't show you jack shit about the instance, they were devised intentionally to make traveling a time filler since there wasn't much content to be had.<br />

Greatly overgeneralized rubbish. A) I don't think that it made anything better or worse. B) Depending on your class and gear, the 2's and were often soloable and 3's occasionally were. The 5s were not and you often saw &quot;LFG {quest X}&quot; in general, just like always for 3 and 5 man group quests. This is no different than TBC. Vanilla doesn't have an equivalent other than the attunement chains, who's targets were scaled around a mediocre party of 5, that would be 3 and 4 manned for expediency.</div></div><hr />

Or the quests (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=4081) that required you to enter a dungeon, kill some mobs, go back to turn in the quest, then kill some more mobs in the same dungeon... (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?quest=4082) (for some reason this quest is not in the live version of Wowhead, but it's on the PTR one ::))</div></div><hr />

I can see him coming back to be part of something much bigger as he was given a whole new model, but the only problem with my theory is the fact that Ner'zhul and Arthas have become one, but that just raises more questions, like who could be left to be controlling Varimathras? :S</div></div><hr />

sorry imo its blizzard who own and control most of the gold market for the simple reason i would if i owned a multi million dollar corporation.<br />
look at it this way the owners of blizzard prob dont play games they drive around in sports cars living in mansions from the money we pay them each month.<br />
game gold = real money well if i owned a buissness like blizz and saw a market for more profit id take it imo blizz have too.<br />
