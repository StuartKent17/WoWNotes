<br />
[...] The dates given in the email has unfortunately lead to some confusion since they do seem to be a bit unclear. The dates given in the email is the dates for when you can sign up for the 3v3 tournament type and not when the tournament will begin.<br />
<br />
The tournament will begin on the 25th of February and last 6 weeks until April 7th, as mentioned in the rules: http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/arena/tournament/rules.html (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/basics/arena/tournament/rules.html)<br />
<br />
When will the Tournament Realms open?<br />
The Tournament realms will open at approximately 10am CET on the 25th of February. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/17/8053487593-the-email-states.html))<br />
<br />
Will the realm be accessible for practice and warm-up before the beginning of the Tournament?<br />
Yes. The first phase of the tournament is called the practise period and should last for 2 weeks. This phase will start up when the realms become accessible for play on the 25th of February. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/17/8053487593-the-email-states.html))<br />
<br />
The FAQ says &quot;After the six-week online qualifier concludes&quot; - what date does this mean exactly?<br />
The tournament should start on February 25th and last for six weeks. The current plan is that the realms are being brought offline again on April 7th at 9pm CET. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/17/8053487593-the-email-states.html))<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A<br />
1. Advertised as 6 weeks - 2 weeks practice, 4 weeks live comp.<br />
2. Invoices received say 5 weeks 1 Day<br />
3. Invoices state today being a day of play, as its being charged for.<br />
4. Tourney information says the tournament goes live on the 25th (impying practice should have started last wednesday)<br />
5. Help &amp; support said to log out and in compeltely to see teh arena servers - this doesnt work. <br />
<br />
1. Correct.<br />
2. That's the sign-up dates, not the qualifier dates. Unfortunately that's not really clear in the e-mail, hence this misunderstanding.<br />
3. The payment is for access to the qualifier, which starts on February 25th and lasts until April 7th - a 6 week period.<br />
4. The two weeks of practice are the first two weeks of the 6 week qualifier.<br />
5. This should work once the Arena Tournament realms are live, should you have started the client prior to the realms going live and not restarted it since. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/17/8041756585-tournament-server-status--facts.html))<br />

Blue posts<br />
Dual-Specialization<br />
I think the implementation of dual spec you are likely to see when the PTR goes live is going to have some substantial differences from the initial announcement. We tend to iterate a great deal, which is one of the reasons we don't do big announcements more often. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14990657573-dual-spec-disappointment-healing.html))<br />
<br />
Nerfing classes<br />
We have made burst nerfs to Retribution paladins, death knights, Arms warriors, Arcane mages, hunters, Feral druids and now rogues. Almost unanimously, the nerfed classes thought that nerfs were needed but that our specific nerfs went too far. Nerfing classes is never fun. Players hate it, and ultimately it means we screwed up or at the very least failed to predict new tactics. But we still need to do it for the good of the game when we think it is warranted. There will be more. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14990477144-why-didnt-you-nerf-overkill.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/priest.jpg Priest (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=640) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?priest))<br />
Baseline Meditation?<br />
If you take all of the good talents and just give them away, then one possible outcome is you are just left with a bunch of mediocre talents and your spec is a lot less meaningful than it is today.<br />
<br />
We like players to have options. That is important. But we also like to have some very attractive talents. This second point can be in direct opposition to the first point. We also don't want every talent in the tree to feel mandatory, because players don't have enough points to get them all.<br />
<br />
All I am saying is there is no hard and fast rule for designing talents. But you should not conclude that because every priest gets Meditation, that that makes it a badly designed talent. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/14990442254-blizzard-its-time-baseline-meditation.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/rogue.jpg Rogue (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=630) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?rogue))<br />
More changes to come in 3.1<br />
On the second question, yes, we have several changes in mind for 3.1 for rogues and only announced a few. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14990477144-why-didnt-you-nerf-overkill.html))<br />
<br />
Assassination specialization<br />
We agree with you about how an Assassination rogue should play – setting up a kill and then delivering it. But bursting someone down who is crowd-controlled while the victim has very limited decisions they can actually make to avoid death is only fun for the rogue. The Mutilate button push is just very strong when poisons are nearly always on the victim.<br />
<br />
I have said before that we don't think Arena is fun when healers are immortal until mana-drained. However, we also don't think Arena is fun when someone always dies in the opening few seconds. The matches need to last long enough for something to actually happen -- for you to decide who you are going to attack or how to respond to their actions. If someone literally has almost no response for your attacks then that is not skill that is allowing you to win matches (and I am not just talking to rogues here).

<br />
So out of the 10 Classes currently live, GC is saying they 'screwed up' on 7 of them?<br />
<br />
I don't think anyone expected DK's to be balanced because<br />
<br />
a) they are new<br />
and<br />
b) they are the 'poster child class' for WoTLK<br />
<br />
But to make that many mistakes across so many classes....even after months of Beta and 1 month in TBC @ LV 70.<br />
<br />
Anyone else feel as frustrated as I?<br />
<br />
I wasn't around for TBC Launch, so maybe this is just plain normal...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">doma</div><div class="date">2009-02-17, 07:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/agree with CobraN. Rogues are squishy as hell right now and probably take more skill than any other class in the game right now to do well in arena or pvp in general. The nerf to tone down burst may have been needed but certainley not before some of the other classes. At one time a rogues stuns were his only defense really, now most dps classes can stun just as effectively but have better armor and many more tools at their disposal at the same time. The stats from that link tell the story really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That would be cool, but I would also like to see a 5 and 10 man version of this as well. I have an amazing 5 and 10 man team for raiding. I could care less about arenas though. However, good for these players, normally it is fun for them. The winners have something to brag about. Normally the entry fees are enough to pay for the prizes. I think this is a good idea that Blizzard has. Also, they always do it in season one then nerf the hell out of the classes that actually won, so whichever classes are in the top ten prepare to enjoy your nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Easy.<br />
<br />
Because the only really strong classes against a rogue in a team based environment are dks and hunters. Which top the brackets, thus making it hard for rogues to climb high.</div></div><hr />
