Legion - Spec Swapping<br />
Yesterday we talked about the 100g placeholder cost for swapping specs (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5433-Legion-Spec-Swapping-Poll-Jan-20-Hotfixes-Blue-Posts-Tweets-Beyond-the-Worlds) in Legion. Celestalon pointed out (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/690307720646430720) that there are costs other than gold that could be used. <br />
<br />

Legion - Vault of the Wardens Dungeon<br />
Vault of the Wardens is a dungeon that uses the same area as part of the Demon Hunter intro experience. There are some interesting mechanics and features in this dungeon, so be sure to watch the video.<br />

Mistweaver Bugs<br />
We plan to make sure that an interrupt on Soothing Mist will not lock out your Nature spells.<br />
<br />
In the next build, Renewing Mist should not jump unless there is an injured target who does not have your Renewing Mists. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/399045-mistweaver-bugs/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20420603182?page=1#3))<br />
<br />
Discipline Bugs<br />
A few more bugfixes that should be in for next build:<br />
<br />
Purge the Wicked spreading to targets that aren't in combat<br />
Focused Will not proccing on absorbs<br />
Dispel Magic and Mass Dispel occasionally becoming uncastable<br />
Resurrection not working at all (all healer specs)<br />
<br />
<br />
Light's Wrath is intended to Atone, but will likely be tweaked to remain balanced on a large number of targets.<br />
<br />
The trait Share in the Light (gives you 15% of PW:S when you PW:S an ally) is proccing the Shield Discpline talent (refund 1% mana when PW:S is consumed). <br />
<br />
I'm assuming this is a bug because it's ridiculously easy for the self-shield to get consumed.<br />
Thanks, this should be fixed next build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/398481-discipline-bug-thread/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20419912912?page=2#31))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
How exactly does a system of HoTs and DoTs work, and why in WoW is there a theme of 3 seconds<br />
They work similarly in every game I have worked on. You assign a damage or healing amount, a coefficient (to scale with stats), a duration, some rules about what happens when you overwrite them, and then a period -- the duration in between each tick.<br />
<br />
There are technical and design considerations for the duration of the tick. The faster the ticks, the less distinction there is between a dot and a direct damage ability. Part of the gameplay is supposed to be that you have to invest a long time in the dot paying out, and the target (in PvP anyway) has a chance to respond or remove it. Technically, you don't want to make too many calls every millisecond, so even though it's possible to have anything update constantly, you want to save those frequent updates for really sensitive things like position and movement.<br />

<br />
It will always be GOLD: because GOLD buys REAGENTS anyway.<br />
<br />
It can't be TIME because you can't punish people because the Raid Leader changed their minds or LFR gave them a different roll.<br />
<br />
It can't be LIMITATIONS because WoW in 2014+ has been all about accessibility.<br />
<br />
It can't be COSMETICS because what the actual fork.<br />
<br />
I suppose it could be WHATEVER.... ¬_¬ :D<br />
<br />
25G a time is fine.<br />
<br />
A straight up gold cost. No. The reagents = gold is not true. If you could gather say herbs make the tomes just be time. A straight up gold cost is dorky, lame, and stupid.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2016-01-22, 05:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gold makes swapping specs to rez a hassle even more than it would be already. Who wants to pay 200g to rez someone? When I'm out in the world and see someone die, I'll throw them the odd rez. Now Blizzard is going to force me to swap specs while paying a gold cost to rez someone. I get punished just for being nice! When I was doing Brawler's Guild, I stand there and rez people while I waited my turn. Now Blizzard's telling me I can't be nice unless I want to stay resto 99.9% of the time. I don't care how much Blizzard's buffing healing damage. Healers ALWAYS do crappy damage and take FOREVER to level. I'm not leveling resto on my shaman nor am I staying resto most of the time at max level. Why is Blizzard insisting on punishing players for being NICE?<br />
<br />
Any reagent cost is ultimately a gold cost. You have to buy them before hand unless Blizzard gives us a mission like the garrison one that gives us free tomes of the mind. Even if you farm the mats to make a reagent (if they let you), time still equals gold!<br />
<br />
Putting a cooldown on spec swapping is worse than gold. If someone's willing to swap specs to rez, then you're suddenly stuck with 2 healers until the one who swapped has their CD back up. That's just stupid. The real healer would have to swap to DPS and hope the swapped healer has gear to even heal in the mean time so you aren't sitting there twiddling your thumbs while you wait. Even in that situation, you'd still have to wait an additional amount of time for the now real healer's spec swap CD to get off cooldown so they can swap back to healing after the swapped healer swaps back to DPS.<br />
<br />
Limitations. As in what? Can't do it inside a dungeon/raid? Yay, Blizzard just flipped off a good part of the raiding community who has raiders swap specs for various fights. They also just screwed players who are friendly enough to rez others in dungeons. Can't swap specs inside 5 minutes of another spec swap? How's that different from a cooldown? Can only swap once a day? Blizzard just murdered offspecs for many people.<br />
<br />
Cosmetics? Now that's just stupid.<br />
<br />
Blizzard putting a cost on spec swapping AND removing rez from non-healers just makes these changes asinine and rezzing convoluted. As I said on the official forums, whatever the hell Blizzard's smoking needs to get thrown out. It's bad.<br />
<br />
I honestly can't help but wonder if Legion will be worse than WoD. Each day something else pops up that makes me less and less excited. And I wasn't much excited to begin with!<br />
<br />
I've been playing WoW since a week after TBC came out. I'm well aware respecs used to have a gold cost. Honestly, if Blizzard's this daft to bring gold costs for spec swapping back, I'd rather keep dual spec. If people want to swap to the all spec system, let them pay like 10k gold for it or something. I'll happily keep with dual spec.</div></div><hr />

It's simple, doesn't cost what Blizzard apparently thinks is an uninteresting [resource] mechanic, and introduces a resource separate from actual gameplay that players still need to properly manage.

<br />
I mean, sure if you want a reagent, whatever. But talent changes and glyph changes currently take one. And while it's a &quot;who cares&quot; thing, that swings both ways. Why do they care? It's not like maintaining a stack of tomes is &quot;immersive gameplay&quot; right now. That needle goes from dumb on the left to infuriating on the right. I think some are calling them out here because even if it's a stupid reagent, it shows that someone over there just doesn't get it, which has repercussions in areas that probably do matter.<br />
<br />
The real cost of a respec should be in learning how to play it.</div></div><hr />

Please think before you speak. Mmo-champion is a curse website those other websites are also curse websites so its really curse promoting itself, that and because there might be a chance that someone that is a fan of one blizzard game is a fan of others is why they have these story links to other sites and games.

<br />
Yeah I remember when it cost 1000g to get dual spec and doing that over multiple toons did get costly especially back then when gold was not raining from the skies like it is now..<br />
<br />
And so very true as far as I know no one complained when the cost of dual spec was drastically lowered to what it is now..<br />
<br />
But the main question that from what I can tell no one has asked is why has Blizzard decided to go in this direction with respeccing costs if we knew that then maybe all this cafuffle might calm down a bit..<br />

I would understand if it was something totally game breaking, like OP classes of stupid dungeon design or anything else but it is not is is over one little thing that when all is said and done is not game breaking at all.. And I wonder those who are complaining must of never played during Vanilla and TBC when to get a new spell or ability it had a in game currency cost associated with it..<br />

I don't get why so many people are freaking out about 100g to swap specs. It takes like 3 minutes to farm 100g anymore and I would assume that'll get inflated even more come Legion.<br />

<br />
I hate this idea and I started way back when the game launched in 2004. I remember every time I dinged I wanted go back to the trainer then spend 15 minutes debating which abilities to train as I never had enough gold. That said...<br />
<br />
This is 2016. I would like to think that anyone who played then is now much older and in similar situations to that of all my friends who are still playing thia game from that same time period. Older and wiser. That model in 2004 worked well for MMOs and we all enjoyed the difficulty at that time. However in 2016 with the current gamer audience and the now much older Vanilla/TBC players, I would venture to guess, don't play this game to just grind endless like the 2004 model. They want to spend their precious time doing fun things not punishing things. I find having to farm gold, even though it is easy something that is not fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah it does not take long to make gold in game, I know people who can make upwards of 10k or more a week..<br />
<br />
Not everyone is as gifted. Not everyone is on a decent server with a decent economy. A lot of servers have trashed economies. Farming gold is not fun for a lot of people. See above.<br />
<br />
Also this just feels punishing to those who switch specs a lot. You know the Heal/DPS, Tank/Heal, classes. Any cost no matter how small would have a detrimental effect on the volume of people with multiple role classes and their willingness to change specs for various in game activities. This will been mostly seen in group activities such as dungeons and raids.<br />
<br />
Lastly I have to emphasize this one the most. New players will be at the biggest disadvantage for having any cost associate with spec changes. With the recent downturn, or as I call it free-fall, in population numbers that last thing the developers should be doing is causing lower quality of life game-play decisions that put a burden on new players.</div></div><hr />

Does this mean that what I've already paid in dual spec fees for all of my characters above level 30 will be refunded/forfeited? We already have the ability to change between two specs now for free (after the one time charge to open the 2nd spec). Has Blizzard given a reason as to why they're reverting this... or am I just missing something?<br />
<br />
I wish I could find the rage filled post that I made on the WoW forums when they dropped the cost of dual spec from 1000 gold to 30 gold. I had just finished farming gold for my 10th toon to be dual spec and had a toon about to be next when they dropped the price and level requirement (it used to be level 40 or 50 I think). All that post did was get me a warning about being too negative on the forums instead of any type of resolution to the problem of them cutting the price so drastically with no warning.</div></div><hr />

But charging for spec swapping is something that completely defeats the whole purpose of a gold sink (i.e. preventing inflation). <br />
<br />
Considering that somebody who swaps specs frequently likely spends more time participating in PvP or PvE endgame content instead of gold farming. So the gold is ultimately being sunk out of the wrong hands here since this person doesn't have as much to spend to begin with. <br />
<br />
Repair costs are one thing... It adds to the sense of defeat if you fail to complete an encounter... So it adds to the experience. <br />
<br />
Spec swapping costs... not so much. &quot;Hey bob, we need you to heal tonight.&quot; -X Gold. No good deed goes unpunished.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I suppose just call me a crusty old bugger.. lol :) And for me with gold I don't play the AH as most of the time what I put on there never sells or I have to sell it so cheap that I lose out on it.. But maybe if they get enough flak on their forums and their twitter feeds they might just might rethink this idea of theirs..</div></div><hr />

Why not just change dual spec to &quot;multi spec&quot;. One time fee, swap specs at will. boom.</div></div><hr />

First of all, in this scenario its 100g to resto and 0g to main spec. <br />
Secondly, which class cannot rez in non healer spec? I can in shadow priest, my druid can as a cat, well, he turns to nelf but still forms don't take gold to activate...</div></div><hr />

Oh, I played during BC and I remember that one either decided to pain level as healer/tank just to be able to do dungeons aswell in the right spec (as you wouldnt respec once a day because of progressive cost which wasnt fading fast). The other option was to just level as dps, do dungeons as dps and then at some high lvl (prefeably max or almost) change back to healer/tank and do some dungeons to get right spec loot. I have actually leveled as healing priest and no thanks to do it again unless Blizzard introduces healer/tank specific quests to level which I doubt. I remember it was hard to find healer or tank to dungeon during BC this also because you had to be dedicated to that kind of spec because of spec swap cost and because it was way harder to obtain healing/tanking gear without actually doing instances and raids as that spec. This changes will only punish dpsers, welcome 2h queue time. <br />
<br />
I actually paid for dual spec when it cost 1000g or something and I did it on a few characters. I even paid my share during BC for respecing my poor druid alt which was much easier to lvl as feral. I don't want to pay up again. Imagine you bought a house and after a year they come and tell you that what you paid was fine but now they want you to pay every month a fee aswell, even if you already own that house and paid it to full. Just stupid.<br />
<br />
Just respecing affects more than group play. I remember respecing just to take a harder quest and doing it as tank instead of dps class. It will cripple fun from hybrid classes that are just this good because you can swap to totally different spec at any time to fit the current challenge. This people already pay price of having two types of gear in inventory and all untill Legion was more and more fitted for dual spec, even armors got to work both ways. Why ruin it? Why revert it? Do they think that I will prefer to level 10 lvls as healer or lvl 9 lvls 3 times as fast as dps and then respec and do last qs and dungeons to get my spec loot?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TheDarkLynx</div><div class="date">2016-01-23, 12:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny how Blizzard has the same shacked mentality 10 years later.<br />
People wanted to play with different specs without leveling new characters and they gave us dual spec instead of triple spec like we asked.<br />
People wanted their gear to matter when they changed specs and they gave us a flexible gear, but not rings or necklaces or cloaks because of reasons. (Which in Legion will change a little too, since we have data from items like 'Vermuund's Beads of Great Convergence' that flexes into Agi/Int/Str)<br />
They decide to give us the transmog system we always wanted, but limited it to &quot;leather users only unlock leather transmogs...yes, they can use cloth too but we don't care&quot; instead of giving us the system we actually wanted: (Diablo 3 system. You drop an item, you unlock his transmog. Transmog rules still apply so you can't transmog plate on your leather user)<br />
Now they FINALLY decide to give us the freedom we always wanted with the specs...but AGAIN with the limitations. <br />
<br />
For pete's sake Blizzard, do you not see the pattern you're in? You make poor decisions just to realize they were poor decisions later. Just listen to your community for once, like you did when we asked (demanded?) for flying in Draenor. Let us spec our characters however we want (and transmog god damnit, I don't wanna have to farm Garrosh only on plate users to unlock his shoulders, I main a druid!).</div></div><hr />

Am I the only one confused by your writing style, or are you just not paying attention to what you're saying? You gave us 4 times when they did what we asked, and there have definitely been many more times they have. So...what???<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't wanna have to farm Garrosh only on plate users to unlock his shoulders, I main a druid!).<br />
<br />
While I would also like to run around in cloth gear as a rogue, Blizzard has already come out with reasons why they don't want to do this and those reasons, although different from our views, are logically sound reasons. <br />
<br />
While I did suggest a mechanic free from gold resources earlier, 100g as of now isn't a big deal. 100g in Cataclysm wasn't a big deal ffs. Lastly, if you feel the need to swap specs so often you're not playing the game as intended. I know this because people (generally) only swap for role changes or pvp/pve changes. While one could argue constant swaps for pvp/pve (I'll suggest a change for that below), swapping specs for role changes to make your life easier is not consistent with the game design of several other [pure dps] classes. Blizzard is all about that balance, so I know that isn't an intentional mechanic.<br />
<br />
For pvp/pve, due to the game's design of constantly moving you between the two modes, it seems reasonable that they could just allow you to have a dedicated pvp and a dedicated pve spec that switches between environments. World pvp would have to abide by normal spec change limitations.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tjur</div><div class="date">2016-01-23, 09:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The dungeons in Legion look to be shaping up to be interesting and fun. When I return to the game, those are what will bring me back. Now will I stay? It depends on how well Blizzard follows through and resists the temptation to kowtow to the newer players who become befuddled by anything remotely challenging in WoW.<br />
<br />
I just read some question on The Queue over on BlizzardWatch where some individual was worrying and asking, &quot;Do dungeons really need to have raid type mechanics in them?&quot;<br />
<br />
That is the kind of player I wish had a toggle on their UI called, 'Phase to God Mode'. Then they could run around to their heart's content doing everything in WoW. They could even get Legendaries as much as they want with 50% drop rates from level 1 mobs. The only stipulation is that their name would be flagged with [SPECIAL].<br />
<br />
I have been playing around on a new character in TERA. I have to say; that is harder than most heroic dungeons now. Again- when Blizzard decided they needed to attract players who hated MMORPGs and started making it a goal to get more players into dungeons and raids, their only strategy was, &quot;Let's make sure no one ever dies in leveling dungeons or questing!&quot;. That was their go-to for way, way too long. MoP's biggest disappointments to me were how simple their Heroic dungeons were and how few there were. But there are scores of players who love that easy stuff. It makes them 'feel' like they are good, powerful players.<br />
<br />
So I am very doubtful the dungeon goals for Legion will be met before the expansion runs it's course. I predict the Lazy Lobby to demand easier dungeons by the time the first patch drops- if Blizzard actually creates a content patch for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was. I've just leveled so many characters since then that it doesn't come into play as I am used to paying 30g for access to the 2nd spec.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't get why so many people are freaking out about 100g to swap specs. It takes like 3 minutes to farm 100g anymore and I would assume that'll get inflated even more come Legion.<br />
<br />
The amount of gold isn't the main issue for me, it's the fact that all (or almost all) of our characters already have access to a second spec when we want it and they're going to take that away and then charge us to get it back... Just doesn't make sense to me.</div></div><hr />
