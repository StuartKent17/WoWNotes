Essences Feedback - Multiple Role Essences<br />
These issues with Memory of Lucid Dreams’ minor effect should be resolved in the next PTR build for Protection Paladin. Thanks for the bug report! (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105773-essences-feedback-multiple-role-essences/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/181167/27))<br />
<br />
The next PTR build will have a change for both Brewmaster Monks and Guardian Druids with the Major power on Vision of Perfection.<br />
Brewmaster Monks have had the Major effect changed to activate Invoke Niuzao, the Black Ox, when it procs. It will summon it for 25/35% (rank1/rank2) of the talent’s duration.<br />
<br />
Guardian Druids have had the Major effect changed to activate Incarnation: Guardian of Ursoc for 25/35% of the talent’s duration when it procs.<br />
The Minor/passive effect is unchanged for both specs, it will still provide cooldown reduction to Fortifying Brew or Survival Instincts.<br />
This should help the Essence feel a bit more noticeable and meaningful when it activates. Try it out in the next PTR build.

WoW Classic “Not A Bug” List Additions<br />
I’ve added this to the OP:<br />
<br />
You are unable to Polymorph enemy targets that are tapped by players with whom you are not grouped. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175887/13))<br />
At all levels of player characters and enemies, aggro radius is set to the intended distance. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175887/14))<br />
Long quest objectives don’t have text wrapping.<br />
Fall damage is equivalent to expected and verified values.<br />
Broadcast text can be seen multiple times if multiple players interact with the same NPC.<br />
WANTED signs do not have “!”, and are also not highlighted.<br />
Player characters do not animate when looting/interacting with quest objects (e.g. collecting pumpkins).<br />
Gnomes and Taurens are the correct size. <br />
<br />
<br />
The last one has been carefully verified. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1105647-wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/) / Official Forums (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/175887/18))</div></div><hr />

It's amazing. I don't know WHAT people were expecting with &quot;classic&quot; but it's like they expected a mix of BfA and vanilla. I'm so glad people are getting it shoved into their faces WHAT is vanilla. Newer people sure I get it but older ones that looked back at it with rose-tinted glasses. The whining from those are just priceless. Keep it up blizzard(in this regard).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not even true.<br />
<br />
The water level in Black Morass was lowered, character models were not touched.<br />
<br />
The only height change added to the game came with when the new models were added, and even with them gnomes still get problems with swimming in some areas due to fishing nodes being too far out to reach. We also swim in the middle of Tiragarde where the Champions of Azeroth wq is.</div></div><hr />

Why do you think that it was replicated? They probably used the old data and those old items did not include animation command in their interaction scripts. So it worked exactly like in Vanilla. Now they either have to go over all quest items and modify their scenarios, potentially introducing some bugs or just check that it was in vanilla and keep it that way.<br />

I hate to burst your bubble, but most of those points are working correctly in private servers. So that nonsense is going from those old-schoolers who think that they remember, but actually they don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
The Beta was limited to active subscribers. The % of active subscribers who actually played Vanilla and actually got a Beta invite is likely extremely small. Thus, there is a high likelihood that many of these Bug reports are being generated by players that never played Vanilla. <br />
<br />
I also don't know who these Vanilla Champions you refer to are but it was clear from the get go that Classic wasn't going to have the QoL features you reference. <br />
<br />
All this list does demonstrate, conclusively, is how much hand holding goes on in the current game compared to Vanilla and how much the player base has been spoiled as a result of having everything handed to them on a silver platter (glowing quest objectives etc etc).<br />
<br />
The next Not a Bug list will probably contain these statements:<br />
<br />
&quot;Aggroing numerous mobs and dying often while levelling is intended&quot;<br />
&quot;Having to use CC on every pack of mobs in a dungeon is intended&quot;<br />
&quot;Waiting for your Warrior to get 3 sunders on mobs before you begin dpsing is intended&quot;</div></div><hr />

That is just the &quot;Slippery slope&quot; argument, and it is an incredibly weak one at that, especially as Blizzard are discussing maybe expanding upon Classic down the line.<br />
<br />
Keep to the argument of &quot;Classic is a replication of Vanilla, warts and all&quot; as the argument, it makes more sense, and is less ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Neither matters in this case with all honesty. Point remains, people want CLassic to be Classic. Blizzard have even gone to great lengths to replicate same bugs, and weird things that went on back then, to keep it as *pure* as possible.<br />
Thus, asking for extra stuff just makes the whole thing irrelevant in that case.<br />
<br />
Never use the slippery slope argument, it isn't credible, nor is it really viable as mentalities change. Use the &quot;Classic is Classic&quot; one instead.<br />

Blame those people who shouted down anything even remotely suggested (and still do for things that don't impact gameplay and would just be replicated with addons anyway).

Just admit you don't want classic. Admit it. You think live is sooooooo terrible but you want the mechanics of live in a vanilla environment...which in and of itself is no longer vanilla. You act like people who want no changes are the dumb ones...:rolleyes: I personally don't care either way. You two bickering over this stuff is the exact reason why blizz didn't want to do this in the first place and I won't be surprised when those servers &quot;die&quot; fairly quickly</div></div><hr />

Guess we'll see, plan on leveling as H Pal in classic and I was quite happy right clicking a mob and then talking in chat because I have no attacks (during stress test) :) I plan on playing the next stress test too and right clicking mobs and talking in chat again lol</div></div><hr />

Is the way life work dude, you cant have aceess to everythign with working for it, Essences right now on the ptr (outside some particular ones) are obtain doing the activity related to it, so you can more reward base on you skill<br />
<br />
I seen the Essences on PTR and seen how you get them all I am saying is if your going to put skills in the game you do not put skills behind a gate in a MMORPG like WoW. I PvP a lot but i know people who never will pvp and never turned on warmode once in BFA and they never will and they never will get Speakers boon I all so know people who only do raid finder and will never get to do a Normal raid and never get Condensed Life-Force. I do not mind putting gear behind a gate like mythic dungeons and raids because that is gear. Skills on the other hand I have a problem with putting them behind a gate. Skills should not be behind a gate. That is just the way I fell about it. Because if you do not do that type of activity you are at a disadvantage because i PvP and you do not or I Raid and you do not. There is a very fine line that blizzard is crossing with this when they start to gate a skill and it will turn people off.</div></div><hr />
