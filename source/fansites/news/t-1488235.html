Warlords of Draenor - 6.0 Patch Note Preview<br />
It is the era of an Old Horde, forged with steel rather than fel blood. A union of great orc clans, the Iron Horde, tramples the planet Draenor beneath terrifying war machines. Azeroth falls next. Worlds uncounted will follow.<br />
<br />
With the Warlords of Draenor beta on the horizon, we’re offering a short preview of some of the changes coming in the expansion, which we’ll be asking a few of you to help us test. Please keep in mind that everything here is subject to change, and that these do not encompass all of the features or changes planned for the beta, or final release.<br />
<br />
Visit the Warlords of Draenor announcement site for more information on the major features coming in the new expansion.<br />
<br />
General<br />
As part of our efforts to present players with smaller and more easily digestible numbers (the so-called “Stat Squish”), World of Warcraft has been converted to use a base-20 (vigesimal) number system. As a result, all stats have been decreased by 2BA0E%. To ensure the game can maintain its current age group ratings, Garrosh Hellscream is now Garrosh Heckscream, and the Cult of the Damned has been renamed to the Cult of the Danged. To prevent confusion over whether you’re playing a card game or returning to town, the Hearthstone will now be called a Homerock. To encourage exploration of the world all Flightmasters are now Walkmasters.<br />
Walkmasters provide a guided tour of the world, giving out small bits of trivia for the area you’re in as they walk alongside you to your destination. If they walk slower than you’d like, just use your Homerock. Daytime in the world of Azeroth is now 50% brighter, and comparatively nighttime will now appear darker. Dogecoin is now accepted as a form of payment, but no one really knows how it works. Due to ongoing legal disputes with the Stonemasons Guild, repairs on Stormwind Park continue to be bogged down in political turmoil. New paid service: Character Bust. Pay to de-level any character back to 1, removing all items, mounts, and gold, so you can relive the good ol’ days. Once again, due to lack of use, the Dance Studio has been removed from the game. The Lion’s Pride Inn in Goldshire has been renamed to the Peppermint Clefthoof. Transmogrification is now an entirely random event, and occurs via a new Hunter Transmogrification NPC named Nivlac. Nivlac will spawn randomly into the world and shoot you with his Transmogrifier to permanently turn your character into whatever he happens to be thinking about at the time. His pet, Sebboh, probably has something witty and insightful to say about that. New Faction: G.R.O.S.S. – This faction is led by Nivlac, and their headquarters is found high in the treetops of Nagrand. Are you prepared to play a spirited round of Nivlac Ball to gain entry into its most hallowed sanctum? The “kazoo music” heard in Pandaren inns now have a chance to play instead of any other music anywhere in the game. In addition to a Proving Grounds medal of Silver or better being required to queue for Warlords of Draenor Heroic dungeons, a medal of Gold or better is now required to post in the forums.<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator-wod#Y))<br />
Death Knight voice modulation has been reduced to infrasound frequencies. Blizzard shall not be held responsible for any damage to subwoofers or loss of control of bodily functions as a result. Brittle Bones now has a 50% chance to turn the target into a purple-wearing supervillain. Threat of Thassarian tooltip changed to explain who the hell Thassarian is. Due to circumstances beyond our control, the pact has been unsealed. Using Death Grip on something larger than your character will cause you to be pulled toward the creature instead of the creature being pulled toward you. Gnomes should just probably not be Death Knights.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator-wod#s))<br />
To equalize utility between classes we have removed the Druid’s fifth spec. Symbiosis now also inherits all raid and boss lockouts from the target. Chatting while in Cat Form will now be presented with poor spelling, in all caps, using the Impact font. Druids in Bear Form now receive a bonus to Fishing. Druids in Moonkin Form are now 50% more delicious. As always, we recommend Free Range Moonkin whenever available. Tree of Life form now has a healing penalty during Autumn and Winter.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator-wod#M))<br />
For safety, all Hunters must now wear bright orange vests at all times. New Pet System: Obedience<br />
Pets now have an Obedience level. Each new pet must now be carefully trained over weeks and months for several hours a day to increase its Obedience level. A pet with full Obedience will obey commands 90% of the time. Pets without full Obedience may randomly decide to chase critters, make messes indiscriminately, pursue other players on mounts, or sleep instead of following a command. Typing /SQUIRREL will reduce all nearby pets’ Obedience level. Pets acquired above level 1 increase their Obedience level at a significantly reduced rate. Bows and Crossbows now use the Gun sounds. Aspect of the Hawk now provides a 30% bonus to Attack Power, up from 25%. Aspect of the Pack has been renamed to Aspect of the Doge. Many daze, much anger, so mystery, wow! Hunters now have access to an exclusive weapon type: Straw. From not-so-great distances, spatter your enemies with unique abilities Spit-wad, Backwash, Snot Rocket, and Booger Barrage. Snake Trap now catches 50% more snakes.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator-wod#g))<br />
Using the Mage spell Blink will now attract the attention of creepy angel statues. Don’t “Blink.” To make playing a Mage more enjoyable, players who use the words “tray,” “food,” “drink,” “table,” “snack,” “mage,” or “pls” in Raid, Party, Battleground, Say, Yell, General, or Trade channels within a Mage’s hearing are killed instantly. All existing Portal spells have been removed.<br />
New Ability: Portal: Walkmaster summons your own personal Walkmaster to lead you to your destination. New Ability: Polymorph Polymorphism, transforms the enemy into a slightly different version of themselves. Time Warp now requires just a jump to the left. Fixed a typo. Ice Floes is now correctly spelled Ice Flows. Mage Armor has a new icon. Ring of Frost has been replaced by Ring of Fire for Fire-specced Mages, and it burns, burns, burns. New vegan Conjure options have been added, including Conjure Soyfreshment, Conjure Fennel Bean Gem, and Conjure Avocado Asparagus Tartine with a Miso Sesame Winter Squash Gastrique.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator-wod#o))<br />
Due to ratings concerns, all references to “brew” have been replaced with “giggle juice.” The amount healed by Healing Sphere has been increased by 1000%, because RUN OVER THE HEALING SPHERES. Blackout Kick now causes the victim to wake up the next day and question their life choices. Legacy of the White Tiger critical strike chance is now increased by 10% for all characters with green eyes. Detox now sends instructions to the target about this new diet you’ve been reading about.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator-wod#I))<br />
Turn Evil can now be cast on players and NPCs. When used, it applies a small dark goatee and causes them to constantly explain their diabolical plans while steepling their fingers. Cleanse now surrounds the target with an outhouse and asks everyone to not talk for a bit. New Ability: Renounce. When cast, Renounce permanently changes the Paladin into a Warrior. Eternal Flame now correctly sets the targeted player on fire, forever. If Diablo III: Reaper of Souls is installed, Paladin characters will stare longingly over a fence at the Crusader, and then look away and pretend to be picking their nails if the Crusader notices.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator-wod#U))<br />
Shadow Priests have been retuned to be almost as good as Warlocks in every way. Almost. Chakra, when the walls fell. Vampiric Embrace now calls upon a glittery vampire to hold you and tell you he will always protect you, Bella. Mind Sear has been renamed Mind Seer, allowing the Priest to see things no else can see. Do things no one else can do. Is it getting warm in here? The Discipline passive Train of Thought can now be interrupted. Probably by the garbage truck, or that dog that just never stops barking whenever they let it outside. Mind Seer plays tricks on you. You play tricks back! It's like you're unraveling a big cable-knit sweater that someone keeps knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting and knitting… New Spell: Holy Diver. Sends the caster down too long in the Midnight Sea.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator-wod#Q))<br />
Rogue specializations have been renamed to better encapsulate the skills and gameplay they represent.<br />
Assassination is now known as “Stabby” Combat is now known as “Pokey” Subtlety is now known as “Shanky” To help resolve spelling issues once and for all, Rogues have been renamed to Blush. Blush can once again use Bucklers! Blush no longer have access to the ability Swash, but at least they can still Buckle. Fan of Knives now also makes your family kind of worried about you. Cloak and Dagger continues to remind you of that Dabney Coleman movie from the 80s with the old couple that really freaked you out.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator-wod#c))<br />
Rockbiter Totem now transforms the Shaman into a large stone elemental that cannot save their friends, despite having such big, strong hands. Rolling Thunder now also causes lightning to strike. Mail Specialization now correctly applies to female Shaman as well. Sorry about that, we misread it. The talent Rushing Streams now also really makes you have to pee. Casting Unleash Flame will now ignite your Healing Rain spell, setting fire to it. We give up. Shaman is now spelled “Shawmun.”<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator-wod#k))<br />
All spells and abilities have been significantly revamped. Again. You’ll figure it out. Warlocks are now overpowered. This will be addressed in a future expansion. Riding Felsteeds single file into battle will no longer hide Warlock numbers.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator-wod#E))<br />
Warriors have been nerfed because reasons. Charge no longer stuns a target, and instead roots them for 1.5 seconds. New ability: Heroic Sit. All that mobility makes Warriors tired. Using Charge more than once in a 10-minute period now applies the “I’m tiiiiiired” debuff, which can be removed by employing Heroic Sit. Heroic Sit roots the Warrior in place, puts on the ballgame, and gives the Warrior an ice-cold giggle juice. Charge no longer roots a target, and instead stuns them for 1.5 seconds. Intervene can now be used when your one friend gets out of hand at the bar again because he can NOT go back to County. Charge no longer roots or stuns a target, and instead Polymorphs them for 1.5 seconds. Shockwave is now aGlyph of Rude Interruption is here too! How’s it going? Just wanted to say hey. Charge is now a passive effect. Disarm now correctly removes the targets’ arms. You know what? Charge has been removed from the game. OK? Great job. We hope you’re happy. The Protection passive Ultimatum just isn’t going to put up with it anymore. It’s either me or her, Jerry!<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
To address player sentiment issues, the daily quest blue-colored exclamation points have been changed to look like the more positively perceived orange-colored ones. The Love is in the Air quest “Crushing the Crown” has been renamed “Crushing the Candy”. Bring it.<br />
<br />
Creatures<br />
All ducks can now drop items. Crabs have been removed from the game... because if I see another one I’m just going to totally lose it. *sobbing* I’m sorry, I just can’t right now... I just... OK just give me a minute, I’ll be OK.<br />
<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
As a part of the pre-expansion launch event, reaching the end of the Siege of Orgrimmar raid will now display: “Thank you! But our Garrosh is in another castle.” Due to recent acquisitions, The Oculus is temporarily inaccessible. Loot drop randomization has been made approximately 30% more random. Despite concerns over workers’ rights violations due to unreasonable weather conditions, Arthas has stated that people should let it go, and that he will indeed remain the final boss of Icecrown Citadel. The cold never bothered him anyway. Single-player dungeons have been added with challenging mobs and boss encounters. Queue times, however, are just going to be, like, totally bonkers. Onyxia has stopped breathing altogether. Emergency services have been contacted and are en route. Flying mounts can now be used in all Pandaria Raids.<br />
As an added convenience, we’ve removed annoying obstacles like walls, ceilings, and anything else resembling an environment. Trash packs now appear more festive and will break into choreographed dance routines when players fly over them. This tech was salvaged from the remnants of the Dance Studio, may it RIP in peace (again).<br />
<br />
Pet Battles<br />
Pet Garrisons<br />
Why should you get to have all the fun? Introducing the Pet Garrison! A miniature version of your Garrison within your Garrison, run by your Battle Pets. Pet Pet Garrison<br />
Why should your pet get to have all the fun? Introducing the Pet Pet Garrison! A miniature version of your pet’s Pet Garrison within your pet’s Pet Garrison, run by your Battle Pet’s Battle Pets.<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Players who attempt to create a character on a PvP realm will first be directed to read a thread about the Censer of Eternal Agony on the forums. The Black Market Auction House has been moved to the floor of the Gurubashi Arena. We’ve reverted recent changes in Alterac Valley, as we’ve discovered the Horde were sometimes able to win. Increased the number of Battleground maps able to be downvoted to 14 (up from 2). Trial of the Gladiator is being reworked, and will instead offer players the chance to judge last season’s Gladiators for their crimes against humanity. Upon being killed in PvP, you’ll now be presented with an interface allowing you to directly contact the developer responsible for this crap. Due to PvE gear being so much better in world PvP, we're now offering all PvE content to those who only purchased the PvP version of the game.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Due to new Horde and Alliance policies, bandages can only be used on players who spend at least 38 hours per week completing quests. Herbalism is now legal in Coldarra. Tailors can now make cloth armor in addition to bags. In addition to picking flowers, Herbalists can now also pick their nose. The ability is only usable when not in line-of-sight with other players.<br />
<br />
UI<br />
Upon beating World of Warcraft, a New Game+ option will appear on the main menu, which allows players to replay the game at a more challenging difficulty level. A new option “Twitch to Move” has been added, allowing movement and actions to be controlled by people watching you on Twitch.tv.<br />
<br />
Items<br />
Transmogrification rules are being relaxed, and you can now transmog trinkets, rings, and neck items. Any references to [redacted] have been removed from the game. Rocket launchers have been added. Sweet, sweet rocket launchers. The Broken I.W.I.N. Button can now be repaired via a one-time purchase through the in-game Shop. The Stoneskin Gargoyle Cape is now slightly whiter and longer than your average cloak or cape. Someone said Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker. Wrathion will once again ask the heroes of Azeroth to embark on an expansion-long quest, culminating in the reward of a Legendary item. First players must reach Draenor and help to guide Anduin through his formative years, teaching him how to talk to girls, how to tie a tie, etc. This process takes approximately 4-5 years, but could extend well into his 20’s depending on how much he resents you. You’ll then graciously enter into the Arenas and attain a rating of 2200 or higher. Wrathion will then send level-100 players on an epic quest to collect 60 small knickknacks from Normal Dungeon bosses. These are just for Wrathion’s small curio collection. You’ll then be asked to go on a whirlwind tour of Azeroth and defeat every Battle Pet trainer—we hope you’ve been practicing! Then you need to get 3,000 Valor; unfortunately Valor might not really be a thing anymore, so he wishes you good luck with that. After that point, though, it’s just a short skip and a jump of beating every Raid boss in the expansion 12 times, on separate lockouts, to prove your worth to wear the ultimate prize, a Legendary T-shirt and the Achievement “I Helped Wrathion and All I Got Was This Lousy Shirt”.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree. Considering how little information has been given out recently about the upcoming expansion, the 4th joke is completely unnecessary.</div></div><hr />

Random Guild Finder<br />
<br />
* As the popularity of the Guild Advancement system continues to rise, we realize an increasing number of players feel that the experience of finding an adequate guild continues to be daunting. To address this, we’re introducing an all-new Random Guild Finder! Players may use this new feature to queue for automatic guild placement. You’ll be placed with a random guild at the click of a button, allowing you to partake in whatever content they may or may not be doing. After being placed, you’ll receive a cooldown which will not allow you to leave the guild, or for them to remove you from the guild, for fourteen days. Get to know your new friends! We’re sure they’ll enjoy getting to know you. If the guild you’re automatically placed in does not exist on your current realm you’ll be automatically charged for a paid realm transfer and moved there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Appearance Tab<br />
<br />
* Acknowledging the continued requests of our players, an Appearance tab has been added to the game! The Appearance tab will finally, at long last, allow players to customize the look of their non-combat pets. Simply summon a non-combat pet and use the Appearance tab to change its look to that of any of the other non-combat pets you own. Summon, customize, and play!<br />
<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
* Character armory profiles will now display current guild status: Solo, In a Guild, Looking for Guild, G-kicked, and It’s Complicated. In addition, character portraits now have the option to be displayed as a self-taken cellphone picture from in front of a bathroom mirror.<br />
* To ensure The Burning Crusade starting zones remain consistent with the rest of Azeroth, it is once again no longer possible to fly in Azeroth.<br />
* Dance Studio has been removed from the game due to lack of use.<br />
* Vashj’ir is now 20% more disorienting.<br />
* Players in capital cities will receive a 2-hour debuff “Homebody” that increases damage taken and reduces damage and healing given by 10% for every 10 minutes they’re within city limits. We hope this encourages something.<br />
* The mouse can now no longer be used to turn player characters. In many cases, this gave certain players a slight advantage over those that used their keys to turn.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes: General<br />
<br />
* Talents are now automatically chosen for a player based on the main specialization chosen.<br />
* Due to player feedback regarding night elf, blood elf, and worgen “flippy” jumps, player characters can no longer jump.<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Knight (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents)<br />
Hero Class improvements<br />
<br />
* Death knights now earn slightly more experience and gold than other character classes.<br />
* When using the Need Before Greed looting system, other players may not roll on loot until the Hero Class has chosen to pass.<br />

* Death knight customer support tickets will always be handled before those of other players.<br />
* Death knights are now required to murder an innocent seven times per week or suffer the “Going Soft” debuff, which reduces damage dealt by 15%.<br />

<br />
<br />
Druid (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents)<br />
<br />
* Druid forms are now considered vehicles, allowing one player to ride on the druid’s back while in any form, even their humanoid form.<br />
* Scratching Post (legendary Feral staff), introduced in a recent patch, was created accidentally and has been removed.<br />
* Different models have been added for male and female versions of Bear Form. The difference is subtle unless you know where to look.<br />
* Druids no longer talk to Innkeepers to set their Hearthstone. They are instead now required to talk to Stable Masters.<br />
* Aquatic and Travel Form were causing too much of a performance hit and have been replaced with lower poly models.<br />
* Druids now perform an area-of-effect knockback when harvesting herbs, looting, or skinning (does not remove Flight Form).<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunter (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents)<br />
<br />
* Hunters now earn Valor Points when they are effectively Vote Kicked from a Dungeon Finder group.<br />
* Chimera Shot, Kill Command, and Explosive Shot have been redesigned as Chimera Trap, Kill Command Trap, and Explosiver Shot, respectively.<br />
* Pets: regardless of what pet is actually tamed, these creatures will appear as either a wolf (Horde) or cat (Alliance) when in combat. In addition, we have implemented an exciting new cross-breeding system where players can mix pets of various families with unpredictable results. Be the first on your server to show off a Mothmonkey, Crocoliskchimera or Warp Crab (these will still appear as either a wolf/cat when in combat).<br />
* Ettin’s Grip (new talent) allows the hunter to equip two ranged weapons simultaneously.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents)<br />
<br />
* In addition to their current spells, mage Mirror Images now can randomly cast Frost Nova, Ring of Frost, Portal: Dalaran, and Mirror Image. Mirror Images summoned by Mirror Images can also cast Mirror Image. Mirror Images summoned by Mirror Images that are summoned by Mirror Images can also cast Mirror Images. Mirror Images that are summoned by Mirror Images that are summoned by Mirror Images that are summoned by Mirror Images…<br />
* The coefficients of all mage cast time spells have been tweaked to be 15% more jaw-dropping.<br />
* All Frost mages now receive a complementary personal Arena rating of 2200 upon reaching level 85.<br />
* Frost mages have been given one additional snare effect, so that they will be brought up to the level of other classes (combined).<br />
* All mage spells that deal Fire damage now appear green.<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents)<br />
<br />
* Judgement has been removed from the game.<br />
* Judgment (new ability) unleashes the energy of a Seal for Holy damage.<br />
* All talents and glyphs which referred to Judgement now correctly affect Judgment.<br />

* Paladins are now required to tithe 10% of their gold income to their church.<br />

* Some paladin abilities did not contain the words Sanctity, Divine, or Justice. This has been corrected.<br />

<br />
<br />
Priest (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents)<br />
<br />
* Members of this class must now make a vow of chastity.<br />
* The Shadow priest talent tree has been redesigned to give them access to most of the cooler abilities of Affliction warlocks.<br />
* Lightwell.<br />
* Four new reactive shields have been added to the Discipline tree. These new spells are called Heal, Greater Heal, Flash Heal, and Prayer of Healing.<br />

* All Shadow priest spells that deal Fire damage now appear green.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogue (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents)<br />
<br />
* Due to continual misspellings of the “rogue” class, we have officially changed the name to the easier to type “rouge.”<br />
* Pick Pocket now works on friendly players, bankers and auctioneer NPCs.<br />
* Vanish now has an additional 5% chance to fail for no discernable reason.<br />
* Rouges equipping helms that resemble eye patches now suffer a 2% hit penalty from lack of depth perception.<br />
* All archways, portals, portholes, and doorways now contain locked doors which require a rouge’s Pick Lock skill to open.<br />
* Sleight of Hand now allows rouges to roll a perfect 100 on boss drops.<br />
* Cheap Shot has a new more anatomically appropriate animation.<br />
* Rouges are now required to pick up all of their blades after casting Fan of Knives before it can be used again.<br />
* Rouges may now cast Stealth while Stealthed, entering the state of Double Stealth, which is not only stealthier than Stealth, but also causes the word stealth to cease to make sense to your brain. Stealth.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents)<br />
<br />
* A healing tree has been added for shaman.<br />
* Flame Shock, Earth Shock, Dot Shock and Frost Shock have all been combined into a new spell called Bus Shock. This ability is less exciting, less powerful and harder to use than equivalents of comparable classes, but it has a new icon.<br />
* Maelstrom Weapon, Unleash Elements, and Spiritwalker’s Grace have been redesigned as Maelstrom Totem, Unleashed Totem, and Spiritwalker’s Totem, respectively.<br />

* All totem ranges reduced to 1 yard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlock (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents)<br />
<br />
* Female warlocks are now correctly called witches.<br />
* Warlocks and witches now take additional damage when fighting in direct sunlight.<br />
* Demons now have a new resource system called Happiness. Torturing, mistreating or speaking harshly to a demon pet will reduce its happiness. The Succubus is an exception to this rule.<br />
* Whenever 2 or more warlocks or witches appear in a raid together, the damage dealt by any mages in the raid decreases by 5%. This effect stacks up to 5 times.<br />
* In addition to their current talent trees, warlocks and witches can now spend points in any mage talent tree as well.<br />
* To make the Demonology tree feel more 'demony' warlocks and witches not specced into this tree will be unable to summon demon companions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior (Forums / Cataclysm Talent Calculator / Skills/Talents)<br />
<br />
* The Arms and Fury warrior hybrid tax is now slightly taxier than other hybrid taxes.<br />

* Quantum Leap (new ability) propels the warrior through time and space, allowing the warrior to take over the identity of an unknown character in an attempt to improve their life or prevent disaster. Cooldown 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Firelands<br />
<br />
* An attunement quest for Firelands is now available! In order to be eligible for the upcoming raid, players must first encounter Deathwing while he is randomly attacking a zone and collect his leavings. Epic quest lines will also need to be completed to collect the leavings from the other Aspects to combine them into the Patty of the Five Flights – the key to unlock the Elemental Plane of fire in the upcoming 4.2 patch.<br />
* Invisible walls have been added around all harmful ground effects.<br />
* All dungeon &amp; raid bosses now have legs. If they already had legs, they got more legs.<br />
* In order to make the Cataclysm expansion appeal to all players’ sense of nostalgia, shaman, druids and paladins may now only queue as healers when using the Dungeon Finder.<br />
* Tank Stimulus: Successfully completing 25 Dungeon Finder runs as a tank will grant you a $400 Federal tax credit. (Requires Form 8863)<br />
* To help ensure players are only using the Vote Kick feature for the greater good of the group, anyone who initiates a Vote Kick will be kicked themselves regardless if the vote passes or not.<br />
* Ever a player favorite, the level-80 10- and 25-player raid of Icecrown Citadel is being reintroduced as a level-85 Heroic 5-player dungeon.<br />
* Ever a player favorite, the level-85 10- and 25-player raid of The Bastion of Twilight is being reintroduced as a level-85 Heroic 5-player dungeon.<br />
* Ever a player favorite, the level-85 10- and 25-player raid of Firelands is being reintroduced as a level-85 Heroic 5-player dungeon.<br />
* Ever a player favorite, the level-85 Heroic 5-player dungeon of Deadmines is being reintroduced as a level-85 Heroic 5-player dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
* All items have had a 65-100% reduction in Fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Cooking<br />
<br />
* A new recipe has been added to Cooking which can be very rarely found inside Deathwing’s leavings. [Recipe: Epic Meal Time] – Use: Set out an epic meal to feed your entire raid or party! Restores 192,000 health and 192,000 mana over 11 seconds. If you spend at least 10 seconds eating you will become sick and “refund” all gained health and mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
* All Arena teams must now contain the word “cleave” somewhere in their name.<br />
* Resilience has been made more literal. Players with high resilience no longer take less damage in PvP, but now bounce when dropped.<br />
* Azshara Crater is now no longer mentioned so players will stop asking about it.<br />
* New Battleground brackets! To further promote fair play Battlegrounds are now bracketed for every single level. 10-10, 11-11, 12-12, … 77-77, 78-78, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />
<br />
* To ensure Orgrimmar and Stormwind are the premiere cities for Cataclysm, NPC’s have been removed from all other cities.<br />
* All NPC’s now have a 25% chance to Dodge right-clicks.<br />
* Due to the popularity of the “Save the Wee Animals” quest in Hyjal, all quests now include an element that requires you to pick up fleeing animals.<br />
<br />
<br />
Races<br />
<br />
* The Worgen “sniff” sound has been replaced by Rebecca Black’s hit single, Friday. The song will play in its entirety. Every time.<br />
* The name of the draenei race has been adjusted to have 20% more vowels.<br />
* Draeneie - The male draeneie laugh has been tweaked to be 7% more irritating.<br />
* The tauren race may no longer choose the paladin class, because… come on. Really?<br />
* The dwarf race’s passive wenching bonus now works correctly.<br />
* Female worgen have been cured of their curse and now have only a human form.<br />
<br />
<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
* All spells and spell macros now have added RP-immersive elements built in that will transmit to all players automatically every time a spell is cast. These cannot be changed or disabled. Examples:<br />
* Flash Heal: “%n raises her hands skyward and calls forth a beam of bright white light that penetrates deeply into the souls of her comrades, healing their wounds and urging them forth in battle!”<br />
* Kick: “%n casually approaches you and dons a monocle before engaging you in a casual discussion concerning local politics and refined beverages. Eventually, the discussion grows heated, and he abruptly tosses his pipe at your feet.”<br />
* The UI addon system has been converted from LUA to Scaleform. All addons will need to be recoded.<br />
* Show/Hide pants has been added to the Interface Options menu.<br />
* A slider has been added to allow scaling of shoulder armor size.<br />

<br />
They did. Last year. Then people complained &quot;WTF BLIZZ DO YOU EVEN CARE ABOUT US ANYMORE!? WHY DIDN'T YOU DO APRIL FOOLS THIS YEAR!&quot;<br />
<br />

I think this is spot on. The issue here is not that they took time out of their day and made some silly patch notes. Its the fact that we had more fake news about the next expansion in one day than the real news in the last month</div></div><hr />

You could make that argument about anything. &quot;Why take weekends off? You could work on the game 7 days a week!&quot; &quot;Who needs holidays? Christmas is cancelled, time to balance some classes!&quot; Sometimes people actually prefer to *gasp* enjoy their jobs, rather than just force themselves to get through the days.</div></div><hr />

It's not a self-diagnose at all (never even heard of that being a thing) and people are quite happy to be around me thank you very much. I just don't want to be around others all the time and I'm quite happy with being able to decide for myself. :)<br />

Maybe you should try and stop being such a little sourpuss throwing around your anger at strangers on the internet and just accept that not everyone will have your outlook on things. Hopefully you can have fun with whatever you enjoy either way.</div></div><hr />

Well no, I'd say my diagnosis is the &quot;fault&quot; of genes and of course the doctors and psychologists involved in my evaluation. Take it up with them. ;)<br />
Also, that blog is nowhere near written by a professional. You shouldn't base your petty attempts to insult strangers over the internet on something anyone with an opinion and a computer can put together. I also have to say that many of the points made are displays of great ignorance.<br />

A few weeks for a few pics from limited angles? You've got to be kidding me, this is an hours work max. It's not like they have a new fake model workdd out with all the movement, class abilities, emotes, etc. from all possible angles.

CLEARLY! I would bet dollars-to-donuts they took the actual new model and modified it for the purposes of this joke. And I don't care how long it took to do it. It shows they really don't prioritize getting WoD into the hands of their customers as fast as possible which is going to bite them in the ass so hard. And yes, I will relish in the CATASTROPHIC sub numbers leading up to WoD.</div></div><hr />

DDOS my ass..<br />

Calm the fuck down, this is bloody hillarious.</div></div><hr />
