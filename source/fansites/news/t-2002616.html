Warcraft Movie - Duncan Jones Interview<br />
Vanion and WoWChakra have interviews with Duncan Jones about the Warcraft movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;448&quot; height=&quot;252&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BZ20vIbPtHg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;iframe width=&quot;448&quot; height=&quot;252&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/uOlsnr7aaMU?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
The movie had to meet the high expectations of the fans, but also appeal to people beyond the fanbase. <br />
The cut of the film was very aggressive to keep the story moving.<br />
If the chance arises to tell more stories, Jones would prefer to do two more movies and then pass on the torch to someone else so that he could see the later stores and enjoy them as a fan. <br />
Thrall would be an interesting character to focus on in one of the next two movies.<br />
Hopefully by the end of the third movie, the Orcs would have a new home.<br />
One of the biggest challenges was the duration of the movie production. It took almost three and a half years of his time, much longer than any of his other movies. <br />
There is enough footage to make an extended edition if there is enough demand for it. <br />
Jones wanted to get the audience to care about the Orcs first, then the Humans. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Legion - Jewelcrafting Neck Items<br />
Legion adds crafted neck items for each class from Jewelcrafting (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/professions/jewelcrafting?filter-expansion=7) that have a unique effect. <br />
<br />
As with many Legion crafting spells, these can be made with Level 1 in Jewelcrafting and become cheaper to make as you get higher ranks of the recipe. (For example: Rank 1 (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/195865-sorcerous-shadowruby-pendant), Rank 2 (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/195911-sorcerous-shadowruby-pendant), Rank 3 (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/195932-sorcerous-shadowruby-pendant))<br />

Hey Mr. Feesl.. how much work is it to create a new mount? With the assets in special.. Is it a lot? Only some? days? Weeks?<br />
Creating the item and mount can be done in a day, a new color can take maybe a few days, new model or anims are weeks/months (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/733727404494073856))<br />

PvP<br />
Any word on how gear will work in world PVP? Stats, pve set bonuses, legendaries, etc? Will I need to pve to wPVP optimally?<br />
Gear will not be adjusted in World PvP and all bonuses, legendaries, etc will work. Anything goes! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/734842770066526208))<br />
<br />
Agree that the vendors have been a social rallying point for the PvP community in the past. We'll see what happens. https://t.co/ASWm4yqyXx (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/734815015908171780))<br />
While I agree with the observation, I don't think it's a reason not to change the gear system. We'll see if a replacement emerges. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/734815332133523456))<br />
<br />
0.1% per item level is way too low. Getting gear will not be exciting or rewarding. Top players having ~3% power advantage is poor<br />
Yeah, starting conservative for sure. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/734839884955848704))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Did you ever discuss having parallel PVE progression for WoW? What argument kill it? What is your position?<br />
Yeah. Love the idea. It's hard not to have one route &quot;win&quot; usually by virtue of being more efficient to get loot. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/727203598367498240))<br />
<br />
was gnome paladins ever spoken about? Thanks, hope your day is going well.<br />
Pretty sure it was discussed. At some point the question becomes should every race just get every class? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/728956136724946944))<br />
In other words, is the greater value having depth/texture by not everything being the same or is it players having max freedom? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/728956405550440448))<br />
No right answer of course but ask yourself should that logic extend to armor and weapons and other restrictions? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/728956579203055616))<br />

<br />
The point of a gold sink is to attract people to actually sink the gold. You'd have to be WoWs most ultra elite running around with several gold capped characters or recently experienced massive brain damage to spend 500k on 4 slots.<br />
<br />
They need to make several very attractive cheaper items that will goad people into buying them since they appear a better deal.<br />
<br />
People would be faster to buy 10 different 50k items than to buy a single 500k item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really, man.<br />
<br />
I came into WoD with around 8000g, the highest I ever had prior to WoD was 22,000g (from a lucky BoE sale), I am not and never was capable of sustained money making. I am now gold capped, doing nothing but garrisons on 2 characters and having several barns set up across my alts rolling trapped Wolves (Bloods still sell easily and Fur is always a big seller).<br />
<br />
I have probably spent 40 hours playing in the past 2 months. Hardly a no lifer thing. <br />
<br />
And to top it all off, I've not been playing WoW for about 7-8 months of this expansion, I had no desire. I could have potentially made it to 2 gold caps or more had I set up all my alts for gold making and it still wouldn't have been a longer than 2-3 hour process per week to run the garrisons.</div></div><hr />

No kidding. I really freaking want that spider mount, but I don't think my entire eight years of WoW combined would total even a half-million gold, let alone that sucker's pricetag of 2 million gold.<br />

<br />

<br />
It's an attempt to drain WoDs abundance of gold out of the economy.<br />
<br />
The problem is, the prices per item are set too high, even the super rich aren't going to spend millions on these kinds of things, maybe the ultra ultra rich will grab the mount but that's really it. They needed more numerous, cheaper (20-100k) items instead, so people could feel they were getting 10+ items out of their 1,000,000g instead of 1.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First the next two movies would cover Warcraft 2 and part of 3, so they wouldn't come anywhere near Cataclysm. <br />
Second it would be hard if not unthinkable to do these movies without focussing on Thrall at some point. This is just Duncan Jones saying &quot;Yeah, I would like to... &quot; while he already knows it will happen.</div></div><hr />

Why would they put a mount for 100k on the Legion goldsink vendor when pretty much everyone and their mother have several 100k without effort now?<br />
Also why is everyone suddenly acting as if that was shocking news? The mount has been 2 mil on Beta all the time and Blizzard had reacted and stated that this was intentional.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the market of people willing to spend 2,000,000 gold on a single item is so incredibly small that these sinks will not remove any notable amount from the general economy.<br />
<br />
Many items priced 20k-100k would be more attractive to a wider amount of players and would be far more effective at draining gold from the economy.<br />
<br />
The amount of players with 2,000,000g to even spend is still tiny, even with WoDs free gold fountain. You're going to be better off getting 10,000 people to spend 100k on an item than to try and get 2,000,000g out of the very tiny fraction of people who have it, especially considering the people with that level of gold tend to hoard it, they aren't the type to spend lots of money, or else they'd never have saved up that much to begin with.<br />
<br />
You don't drain money from people by adding massive price tags, that gives people sticker shock. You do it like every casino and theme park does it. You offer up many attractive things with decent prices.<br />
<br />
20k here, 40k here, 34k. The average people won't really notice themselves spending this gold on each item, but before they know it they've bought 40 items and blown 850,000g total. That's how you drain gold, it's a tried and true method used in the real world for centuries.</div></div><hr />

This sink will remove fuck all from the economy. No one is going to buy a 1,000,000g pet. No one is going to spend 500,000g on a bag that has 4 more slots than a 500g bag. Blizzard has already tried this asinine overpriced vanity item gold sink strategy before and it failed for a reason. Economy 101, what do you think pulls more money from the general market, $1,300,000 Bugattis or $35,000 Hondas?</div></div><hr />

Exactly. <br />
<br />
They don't intend this to be a gold sink. 1) for the reason above and <br />
2) this vendor will be a rare spawn, very much like Voidtalon, with several different spawn locations and no fixed spawn timer, so even if u were lucky enough to find him, u maybe won't have the gold to spend. So it's a collector thing, not meant to drive ppl insane in the beginning of the game for something they can't afford. If u wanna show off, u'll have to have the gold and then hunt him down. So it's very very very unique.</div></div><hr />

I don't get why everyone gets so rilled up about the merchant. If you don't like his gold costs, just ignore him and move on with your life, its not like its mandatory for you to buy something from him. :) Some crazy people will buy the mount and they'll have a very rare mount to call their own, I don't see how thats so bad.<br />
<br />
Back in BC we had this super expensive bag from Haris Pilton, which everyone said was way too expensive to buy for a mere few slots extra. It cost 1200g (and later on got a new one with 2 more slots for 3000g!). Think about that. ;)</div></div><hr />

Totally agree! It feels like orcs are Blizzards most favorite in World of Warcraft with Thrall being forever good character. Blizz didnt mind destroying some good characters (even Jaina had to go crazy though one would think she would be last to do it), making them often enemy bosses but somehow Thrall is this one good forever character. Even if I like Thrall character there is too much of him everywhere...<br />
<br />
I would prefer to see movie with Night Elf focus as they got very long and complicated story. Then we got interesting Dreanei, human with Arthas and Jaina to make some heroic movie, even worgen and trolls are less exploited than orcs. Orcs are just boring and besides their demonic corruption there is no special background to them, just barbarians.</div></div><hr />

You are missing the entire point of this vendor. It's not meant to be a gold sink, when the blue poster talked about this and said that the price is not going to change, he said their goal with this was not to make it a gold sink but rather a vanity reward aimed at people with millions of gold if they want to buy it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is, the prices per item are set too high, even the super rich aren't going to spend millions on these kinds of things, maybe the ultra ultra rich will grab the mount but that's really it. They needed more numerous, cheaper (20-100k) items instead, so people could feel they were getting 10+ items out of their 1,000,000g instead of 1.<br />
<br />
It's going to be hilarious when like 5 people buy the mount and Blizz gets the stats back, sees it's not working and nerfs the cost. Those 5 people are going to be pissed.</div></div><hr />

Me neither. The point is not about Overwatch (imho at least, I can't get into DLC's author head).<br />
The point is about MMOs being put in competition with MOBAs and shooters, which allow you to instantly jump into content and do stuff, as opposed to spending hours grinding mobs and gather flowers. It could be Overwatch, HoTS, LoL, Hearthstone or something else in that comic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People that can afford things like this have probably working towards it for some time, and many who have been playing for long periods of time still may not have that much gold due to not caring about gold amounts. New players should NEVER be able to jump into a game and have everything that older experienced players have. They should have to earn it just as much as any player before them.<br />
<br />
It is this type of attitude, that everyone should have everything someone else has with little to no effort, even 'new' players getting everything easily so they don't &quot;feel crappy&quot; is one of several things that is causing WoW to be the shit game it has become. <br />
<br />
The game has steadily LOST subscribers since Wrath. People can blame anything and everything for this decline, but this is about the time they started catering to any and every whiner that felt they needed to be heard. This used to be an MMO, things take time, and things need to be earned, not given out freely...even if you are a new player, get out there and earn things. Just becasue it &quot;feels crappy&quot; to not have something, doesn't mean it should be made retarded easy to obtain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They have always made exclusive rewards.. This is nothing new at all, only top .5% of the pvp ladder get gladiator mounts, and only top mythic raiders get mythic end boss mounts until the next expansion where a few more will get them from farming the 1% chance.<br />

<br />
I came into WoD with around 8000g, the highest I ever had prior to WoD was 22,000g (from a lucky BoE sale), I am not and never was capable of sustained money making. I am now gold capped, doing nothing but garrisons on 2 characters and having several barns set up across my alts rolling trapped Wolves (Bloods still sell easily and Fur is always a big seller).<br />
<br />
I have probably spent 40 hours playing in the past 2 months. Hardly a no lifer thing. <br />
<br />
And to top it all off, I've not been playing WoW for about 7-8 months of this expansion, I had no desire. I could have potentially made it to 2 gold caps or more had I set up all my alts for gold making and it still wouldn't have been a longer than 2-3 hour process per week to run the garrisons.<br />
<br />
I have 11 max level chars running garrisons only. On EU, at least on my server, fur (or any material) doesn't sell for so much, so your method wouldn't be good here. I pay my gametime with tokens since our wages aren't that great to maintain it (that is around 88-94k per month). I get that amount back in 1-2 weeks. I'm over 1 million now (started around 100k maybe), doing garrisons everyday, but gold capping? Sure, a dream only. <br />
<br />
2 m gold is insane, this is a spider mount. Yeah nifty, but can't even fly or anything special about it. Looks badass and that is all. For 2 m, at least fly or do something else. Many nice mounts are behind the raid or money wall. At least drop a great looking mount what can be achieved by a normal person. Not this hippo/wolf/boar nonsense.</div></div><hr />

It's not meant to be a gold sink, when the blue poster talked about this and said that the price is not going to change, he said their goal with this was not to make it a gold sink but rather a vanity reward aimed at people with millions of gold if they want to buy it.<br />
<br />
Is it not weird that they are so strongly committed to that price so early? Aren't the Blue's normally the ones bitching and moaning about people assuming things are set in stone? Such a weird, new, stance for them to take on this...<br />
<br />
And while that's normally a safe statement to make -- that's a new entire mount. It's not a re-color. That's a fair amount of resources to invest into something for so few people to own, wouldn't you agree?<br />

<br />
They have always made exclusive rewards.. This is nothing new at all, only top .5% of the pvp ladder get gladiator mounts, and only top mythic raiders get mythic end boss mounts until the next expansion where a few more will get them from farming the 1% chance.<br />

For the first part, no. The devs literally never &quot;bitch and moan&quot; that things are not set in stone. In fact, it's not even remotely rare that they make a statement about something that's unlikely to change.<br />
<br />
Secondly, of course it's a unique model. There would be no point in a 2 million gold mount if you could just get a recolor of it from doing a dungeon. So no, I would not agree on that.</div></div><hr />

That has not been my experience with reading their snarky-ness about alpha and beta situations. All in all, I'm going to have to disagree but w/e, you're entitled to your opinion on it.<br />
<br />
So, just to be clear, they made a unique model that few people are going to own? That must have been an interesting pitch to management. Invest resources for a new model and artwork on something that is going to be unique.<br />
<br />
I seem to recall them saying they don't plan on doing recolors of it. That must be some board teams... because I can't imagine that being a normal sane decision for anyone to make.</div></div><hr />

It feels like orcs are Blizzards most favorite in World of Warcraft with Thrall being forever good character. Blizz didnt mind destroying some good characters (even Jaina had to go crazy though one would think she would be last to do it), making them often enemy bosses but somehow Thrall is this one good forever character. Even if I like Thrall character there is too much of him everywhere...<br />
<br />
I would prefer to see movie with Night Elf focus as they got very long and complicated story. Then we got interesting Dreanei, human with Arthas and Jaina to make some heroic movie, even worgen and trolls are less exploited than orcs. Orcs are just boring and besides their demonic corruption there is no special background to them, just barbarians.<br />
<br />
So true and it seems they did their best to leave out and rarely mention demons if at all when it comes to orcs. One of the main things that made their generic orcs more interesting they pushed back to nothing more than a random mention.<br />
<br />
You can tell where the focus is on this movie and it being a split between orcs and humans is a bit of a stretch. The focus was orcs. The money went into orcs and their lines and their screen time. The human script and scenes are hardly worth mentioning if you read reviews. This was always an orc movie not a version for both.</div></div><hr />

Err, the Warlock one is extremely pointless. Demons barely die and if they do we can pop a new one instantly. When a pet dies the lock almost never has lower health as the pet was tanking up till that time (hence why it died in the first place). Now if it gave a shard it would maybe help a bit with questing.<br />
I will probably get it for the stats till raid gear, but I do not expect it to actually give a helpful proc at any point in time.<br />
<br />
Shaman and Warlock ones don't really help with questing all that much as most other necks do. But at least Shaman one has some situational use in a few zones. Warlock one.. not at all.</div></div><hr />

How big of a ego do you need to have to take an already wrote story and start changing right and left to make it &quot;better&quot;. I understand when you need to cut stuff that coundn't fit into the new format, but not when you change the story.<br />
<br />
What, Warcraft is &quot;War And Peace&quot;, a revered classic work of literature? C'mon. It's lore that was created as a secondary feature of a video game where the goal is to kill a lot of stuff. Improving Metzen's writing is not that big a task - and what works in a video game, doesnt necessarily work in the 90 minute timeline of a movie. An *accurate* portrayal of the WoW lore would need to be done like GoT, to introduce and follow all of the characters and stories. <br />
<br />
I remember when Starship Trooper came out, I was really into seeing it - I'm a HUGE Heinlein fan, and I was curious how they'd pull it off - Heinlein was a great writer, but he tended to have his characters make long speeches, which don't really fit an action/sci fi movie. The Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Stranger in a Strange Land are amazing books - but they're very chatty books, most of the good stuff is long conversations - they'd be boring shot as is as a movie. I realized the same thing halfway through Troopers - the book wouldn't make that great a movie, but Verhoeven took the best concepts and characters and expanded on them. Is it perfect? No. Is it entertaining? Yes - and thus, it's fine. And the book is still a classic.<br />
<br />
So, you can talk about ego - all the while ignoring the creative process and the idea that Jones just might have a different, better take on the story for a movie screen, than what Metzen cobbled together over what, 20 years, in the background of video games. Even Metzen changes his mind and retcons the material - why can't Jones?<br />

If Blizzard wants sink gold from economy, then ie. raising overall repair prices by 1% works much better than adding 1000 special 2M mounts.<br />
quote from Blizz guy:<br />
&quot;There are, as people have noticed, a small handful of very expensive items on vendors in Legion. This isn't anything fundamentally new - the original Kirin Tor Signet Ring cost a small fortune in relative terms when it first came out in Wrath, as did the Grand Expedition Yak in Mists.<br />
<br />
When it comes to cosmetic items and convenience perks, they vary tremendously by source, both in terms of playstyle and degree of difficulty. Some are widely-earned rewards, some were simply a matter of being around at the right time (e.g. the Onyxian Whelpling), others require tremendous skill (Gladiator mounts, Mythic raid mounts from current content), while others require a combination of persistence and luck (Time-Lost Proto Drake, Elegon's mount, etc.). Some require you to engage in PvP, others require raiding, others require extensive outdoor gameplay, or profession use. And some require a sustained and concerted effort to accumulate a ton of gold.<br />
Besides, think of it as a favor to all the arachnophobes out there - do you really want massive spiders skittering around everywhere?&quot;<br />
<br />
2M Spider mount is what it is, just another mount for very, very small group of players.</div></div><hr />

You know you are on a site dedicated to a game, which is only the latest in a series that started with &quot;Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans&quot; right? This is like complaining about The Hobbit for having a Hobbit in it, wtf were you expecting?<br />
<br />
When I play the sims I constantly go around whining to anyone that will listen that I'm sooooo sick of humans.<br />

To change positions and to play devil's advocate: We don't know how much gold inflation there will be in Legion.<br />
It's possible that how we view 500k will be the same as 2mill.<br />
<br />
We do already know. There are no garrison spitting gold at you like things in Legion. They are wanting to go the opposite route to try and get rid of all that gold that was spewing out like crazy.<br />

No garrisons doesn't mean there won't be gold inflation else where though. I don't know what end-game Legion will feel like.</div></div><hr />

Also i never played WC1-2 (only watched when someone else played) and only couple of missions of WC3. Even if WoW orcs would make world peace IRL, i would not like them.<br />
To use your example, it would be more along the lines of wanting to go see a WW2 movie but complaining that there are Nazi's in it. If you don't like orcs, fine, no one's saying you have to, just don't expect much sympathy from the folks who do/don't care either way. It's a Warcraft movie, it's gonna have orcs. Don't like it? Don't watch it.</div></div><hr />

Garrisons were put in before they came out with the token. As soon as the token was going to be rolled out I recall them trying to nerf garrison gold making. I remember people freaking out on the forums about it. I think they would have done more nerfing if they could but realized there would be too much backlash. Going forward it would seem they want to try and get rid of all that inflation and want more people going towards tokens if they want gold. I haven't seen anything in the beta that would be handing us gold. Seen a lot of dumb shit with them trying to get us to spend gold though. Like charging for changing specs etc.</div></div><hr />

Besides, it's still in beta, the price might still change before live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeh, i never intented to. I've not actually watched movies in years, and all those screenshots (of orcs) definitely don't make me to go and watch it. I don't think i would watch it even if it had no orcs.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure if i even have actually commented about the movie before this thread, i just got really angry about orc propaganda.</div></div><hr />

LSD is by far not enough to come up with those effects. This is something far stronger.</div></div><hr />

They didn't try -- they did.<br />
They nerfed the garrison gold missions in such a way that having more alts wasn't so massively beneficial. It's still hugely beneficial but no where near what it was.<br />
<br />
But people are assuming that garrisons are the *only* way to make that large amounts of gold and Legion won't have anything comparable to it. Maybe they are right.. maybe they aren't.</div></div><hr />
