Flying in Warlords of Draenor<br />
We still think a 6.1 patch seems like a pretty reasonable point where flying would become available in Draenor, likely with some kind of aforementioned prerequisite. Maybe it's gold, maybe it's some kind of epic quest, maybe something more straightforward. But we're staying open to changing that post-release if it seems like it's working out really well and we want to keep rolling with it. I'm digging that there seems to be a pretty reasonable mix of beta experiences here though. Definitely looking forward to feedback when we get to the max-level content too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Blue Posts<br />
Is there a certain reason that special ability multistrike rolls are delayed (especially the 2nd multistrike roll being time dependent on the 1st), while auto-attack multistrike rolls are instant and independent?<br />
<br />
This 0.3-0.7 second delay is problematic for Colossus Smash, as any multistrikes from the last ability in a CS window will most likely land after CS has worn off.<br />
It's an important part of making Multistrike feel like a distinctive stat. If you Multistrike a Frostbolt, you shouldn't just see 2-3 damage numbers pop up, you should actually see 2-3 Frostbolts fly out of your hand. Or if you Multistrike a Sinister Strike, you should at least see 3 impact visuals. This naturally includes delays, so that these effects are visual.<br />
<br />
There already is a slight delay built into the animation of whatever ability you use (time it takes to swing your weapon down to the impact point, or raise your hands to the launch point of the spell). These average around something like 200ms. Multistrikes are offset by 533ms for the first one, and 866ms for the second one.<br />
<br />
That all describes the visual, but what about the functionality? The 200ms delay I mentioned is purely visual, it doesn't actually exist for determining damage. For Multistrikes, the caster's stats are always used at cast time (t=0). Sometimes the target's stats matter as well, and those are used at impact time (t=533ms and t=866ms, plus travel time if there's a missile).<br />
<br />
However, the Multistrike delays don't apply to all cases of Multistrikes. Auto attacks, heals, and periodic ticks have no delay. Special attacks do have the delay.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Yes, it's important, and Colossus Smash is a bit of an outlier in that it has a notable impact on DPS.<br />
<br />
Should the Thirst for Blood talent be proccing off of multiple Rends? Rage generation gets pretty ridiculous around 5 targets.<br />
Yes, for now.<br />
<br />
Currently it seems SR doesn't gain bonuses from Find Weakness or Sanguinary Vein. This makes sense because it's a different 'entity'. Is this intended? Should a rogues 'pet' gain bonuses like this?<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Another question separate from this. Should SR's Ambush/Backstab Multistrikes trigger Sinister Calling?<br />
For now, no.<br />
<br />
Shadow Reflection is inherently a unique situation, and we have a lot of decisions to make about what it can do and what it can't. We have to balance it feeling rewarding to the user, and not being overpowered or buggy or overly complex. A lot of these decisions are somewhat fluid, and we can adjust them based on how things play out. If it ends up underpowered for Subtlety, we may end up enabling Sinister Calling for it, for example. Here are some more current details:<br />
<br />
- It does not currently trigger any of your procs.<br />
- The Reflection ignores stealth requirements, but does not ignore positional requirements.<br />
- It can multistrike/crit as normal.<br />
<br />
This description of multistrike concerns me greatly. For rolling DOT effects such as ignite, if I understand you correctly, the following situation could occur:<br />
No, Ignite is always rolling, and you never care about just the ignite from a single hit. You're observing the difference between the very very first ignite impact of the entire fight to every other one.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and ignoring the damage of the Multistrikes.They add to the Ignite.<br />
<br />
The current AT POM Pyro-chaining behavior for building up combustions utilizes &quot;ignite tick time gaming&quot; a lot.<br />
We'd rather remove that obscure, unintuitive, super-precise-timing-based mechanic. We're considering the best way to do that, currently thinking of changing Ignite to be a 1sec periodic, 5sec base duration.<br />
<br />
The majority of raiders completely ignore the numbers that they are doing<br />
Not only is this false, it's something we're looking to improve, and it's not the only type of gameplay.<br />
<br />
The small delay that you are using does not result in any multistrike-feel either, as they are still so closely spaced together that it feels like they instantly happen. You would have to be paying special attention to each and every spell in order to notice multistrikes (coming from personal testing, hitting the dummies for a few minutes).<br />
Again, totally false. Regardless, this thread is for theorycrafting, not philosophy.<br />
<br />
Has the Creature-Attack-Player crit chance formula changed at all, in WOD? It did not get posted with the previous info dumps on page 1. If it did not, is it still (5% + (0.2% * LD))? And can the base 5% be reduced by mobs lower level than you?<br />
<br />
While on the topic of Creature-To-Player crit chance, can you explain the mechanics behind &quot;Sit Crit&quot;, where sitting down will result in always being crit? It seems that this got half-removed in WOD, unless I did my testing wrong.<br />
Unchanged. Sitting should still increase your chance to be crit by 100% and lower your chance to dodge/parry/block by 100%.<br />
<br />
Theorycrafting Details for Molten Earth<br />
As long as you have attacked something within the last 6 sec, molten stone bolts will rise out of the ground periodically and fire at your most recently attacked target. <br />
<br />
Period is 2sec/haste. Each tick, the bolt that it fires is offset by randomly up to 4sec/haste, to create visual variety/clustering, but still average to a 2sec/haste period.<br />
<br />
Aborts firing if the target is dead or has a breaks-on-damage aura. Can crit, can multistrike. SP Coefficient is [MasteryPoints]*5%.<br />
<br />
Could you elaborate what you were talking about in this Tweet: https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/487847450841841664 ? Specifically, I am confused about the mechanic you are proposing and the intention/reasoning behind the change. Is the aim for it to heal less then it does (comparatively speaking, I know all healing right now is insane) now? More then it does now? Or is the goal something else entirely?<br />
Conversion is straight up overpowered on beta right, so it's going to come down across the board. However, what I'm talking about there is the difference between specs. Frost has significantly increased RP generation rate through Frost Presence, and Blood gets significant extra RP through Multistrike. They're both balanced around that increased RP generation rate.<br />
<br />
The idea with how Conversion limits RP generation on live is to try to equalize them by costing Frost/Blood more (by preventing their extra RP gen). However, a fair point with that approach is that it reduces all of their RP gen, not just the RP they spend on Conversion. So, we're considering alternatives. The leading one is simply making it cost different amounts for each spec, for the same healing, such as 15/sec for Frost/Blood, and 10/sec for Unholy. Don't know if those are the right numbers offhand, but something in that ballpark.<br />
<br />
It seems that eminence dont work with multi strike. Is it intentional?<br />
No.<br />
<br />

Beta Information<br />
You guys are cranking out these builds!<br />
Yeah, we'd like to be able to keep up this pace as much as we can. Even if a build doesn't have massive new content (new zones, etc) it will just be more current in terms of class design changes and data changes in general. Additionally, we sometimes only discover issues when a build is released to the public and we have the large beta userbase logging in and straining the servers. Sometimes that results in a less-than-ideal play experience for you folks, and while I know that can be frustrating it is very helpful for us to uncover those issues now as opposed to later on down the road. <br />
<br />
Hopefully the newest build will clear up some of the Garrison problems, including as was mentioned earlier in the thread the Garrison locking characters inside and rarely letting them out. I haven't been able to complete any missions for days sadly.<br />
I can clear some of this up, maybe. Despite looking like it's connected to the Draenor Continent, your garrison is actually on a different &quot;map&quot;, in the same way that Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms are on different maps. Using some pretty fancy tech new to 6.0, we're able to transfer you from your garrison to the Draenor continent and vice versa without a loading screen, but if there are server stability issues you can be in a situation where Draenor is &quot;down&quot; but your Garrison is fine. When you attempt to leave the Garrison, you'll get snapped back to your Garrison because the transfer failed. (Note that even without this new tech, you'd experience pretty much the same behavior with walking through a portal).<br />
<br />
I can't say with certainty this build will clear all that up, as you'll experience that behavior whenever a continent crashes. In reality it'll be an ongoing thing as we work to address the issues encountered on beta.

Tank Specs in PvP<br />
Hard to test out tanks in PVP when they are so broken right now. Unkillable gods of destruction.<br />
So hey, about that...<br />
<br />
We discovered a teeny tiny little issue with the Battle Fatigue debuff. Turns out, it was set to increase tank damage taken by -25%. Yes, that's an increase of negative 25%... which means that Battle Fatigue was actually reducing the damage tank-specced characters were taking.<br />
<br />
This should now be fixed on Beta servers, which should make quite a difference. Let us know how things feel now.<br />

No. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484187549640835073))<br />

RE DK Loving Blood Caked Blade for Unholy, looks great - anything similar coming for Frost? <br />
Not really; Frost isn't supposed to favor Multistrike. That said, for that feel, Razorice is slightly similar (and has been buffed) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484503889031344129))<br />

Without an affordable swiftmend, rdruids are locked into refreshing harmony via healingtouch (i.e. forced to use HT once in 20s)<br />

As it stands, MoC is strictly superior to Germ/RG, because the later add restrictions, while the first removes them ...<br />
Moment of Clarity is likely overpowered with current tuning. It's not designed to be &quot;strictly superior&quot;, obviously. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484618803607633920))<br />
How is MoC being op related to Germ/RG being awful talents? As long as MoC is slightly useful, you won't pick the other two...<br />
A) If you think Germ is an awful talent, you're not thinking of all the potential situations. B) RG probably needs to buff SM. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484623352837849088))<br />

LnL changes: Trying it out now, I like it a lot. One Q: what happens at lvl 90, patch 6.0 with 0% multistrike?<br />
There's at least raid buffs that provide Multistrike. Agree that it's awkward for now, but perhaps worth it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484507586356445184))<br />

How exactly does conjured food count as a survival ability? You never get a chance to sit and eat in arena. Debuffs don't help.<br />
That's not what that section of the patch notes is about. Most are unusable in arenas, if you notice. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484254354233249793))<br />
Most of what are unusable? Debuffs?<br />
The sustainability section that you're referring to. They're to aid with questing and other soloing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484254876499574785))<br />
But you can't eat while in combat. Any class can get food from a vendor so it isn't comparable to sustain. of other classes.<br />
Most of those are primarily used out of combat. And no, Mage food is better. It's for questing/soloing, as I said. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484255692891500544))<br />
Mages have a lack of over time healing compared to every other class. a 40% heal from ice block every 5 minutes is underwhelming<br />
Yes, and they're designed to *avoid* damage, not heal it back. They have burst absorbs, damage reversal, Invis, Nova, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484256372540715008))<br />
So are these avoidance-abilities being retuned for warlords, because right now my absorbs aren't comparable to healer ones.<br />
Nor should they be. You shouldn't be soaking up that much damage. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484257232859561984))<br />

are frost mage mastery Icicles going to snap shot off frost bolts, or scale to the damage of a frost bolt at the time of fire<br />

will icicles scale to the current level of incanters flow or will they snap shot off a frost bolt that was buffed by flow<br />

shadow priest self healing feels very lackluster atm. maybe have instant and in shadowform PoM back? or renew?<br />
No, but DP is changing to cause healing equal to 100% of damage done (DD and DoT). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484515657455636481))<br />
while questing, you barely get a tick of DP before mob dies. Biggest issue I had with Shadow. Healing on initial cast?<br />
....I'm fairly certain that you just responded to the answer with the question. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484614656028209152))<br />
Does that mean even the initial cast will do 100% healing of that damage and not just the rolling dot?<br />
Ah, there's the missing link, I think. &quot;DD&quot; = Direct Damage. Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484627021960466434))<br />

I can accept HS being removed. Don't like it but accept it. Still a 3 button rotation (4 w/ rare RB proc) is too much.<br />
I question why you think RB is rare. It's more frequent than CS, even naked. With even blues it's twice as frequent. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484217562880671745))<br />

Spent a lot of time this evening playing on Fury. The 0.5sec Wild Strikes really make rage capping easy to avoid. Rage feels in your control (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484212364493856771))<br />
It can definitely still get away from you if you don't pay attention to it, but you certainly have the tools to manage it now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484212651677872128))<br />
I look forward to the feedback from people who give it a real try in the next build (day or few, I believe). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484212947502112769))<br />
How will 0.5sec WS work for me, as I play with 180ms if I'm really lucky? Most of times I get 270 ms. 0.5sec going to be bad.<br />
That won't actually be bad at all. You're not GCD capped so slight timing offset doesn't matter, plus huge responsiveness upgrades. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484250942368280577))<br />
<br />
Any thought to adding a defensive aspect to Prot Warrs' Ultimatum procs? It just seems outdated to only be an offensive proc.<br />
They have enough defensives; it's nice to have a proc that you know you don't need to worry about for defensive value; a bonus. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484626144105226240))<br />
<br />
On the Warrior Prot: Unyielding Strikes: Will using Ultimatum consume the stacks?<br />
The Unyielding Strikes buff isn't consumed. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484774010752737280))<br />
<br />
WS would have to massively beat out RB in DPR to compete, and at that point you'd say, &quot;why have both spells filling the role?&quot;<br />
WS doesn't beat RB in DPR, but it does beat it in DPCT, handily. And if you're GCD locked, DPCT starts mattering a lot. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484921216080166912))<br />
5 rage + 0.5 gcd WS? sounds painful to play with high latency.<br />
The -25 thing was just to illustrate that it's untuned, not any indication that that's remotely correct. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484953694773841920))<br />
<br />
There are a lot of abilities requiring defstance. Is it intended that Gladstance be excluded from using them, or just not update<br />
Gladiator Stance is for DPS, but restricted from swapping, so will likely count as both Battle and Defensive. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484954216536891392))<br />

Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
Does Multistrike benefits from + %damage buffs?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484235608580034560))<br />
<br />
I'm assuming like all tertiary stats, multistrike will not be in abundance so it won't be something we should bank on<br />
Multistrike is a secondary stat, as abundant as Crit or Haste or Mastery. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/484519312577675264))<br />
<br />
it's seems like pvp power and resilience build into one stat . So very awful...<br />
PvP Power/Resilience &amp; Versatility have a common effect but overarching design is very different. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484447298965864448))<br />
We didn't like Resilience because it got so large that spells felt VERY different in PvP/PvE. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484447444659220482))<br />
We didn't like PvP Power because it was meant to compete directly with ilevel, which led to a lot of confusion. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484447653967564800))<br />
Versatility is a secondary stat on PvP and PvE gear and competes with Haste/Mastery/Crit/Multistrike. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484447890291441664))<br />
is it possible for Versatility to actually outperform other stats? ex. Frost Mastery, Subtelty Mastery etc.<br />
Since it has damage reduction, it is tuned to not be as good at increasing damage. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484454847966490624))<br />
up to now we've been told &quot;not as good as your best stat&quot;. Is it going to actually be dead last, or somewhere in between?<br />
It has benefits that aren't related to damage so it is subjective. But it won't be your first or second best stat for damage. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484457429661278210))<br />
<br />
Challenge Modes<br />
CM's are too item oriented, 30s tries then 10m wait for banner cd is no fun, could you either make cds reset or items unusable?<br />
Agreed. In Warlords we'll be much more careful about which items are allowed to work in CMs. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/484202506872840192))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
With the removal of feats for SoO in 6.0 will this mean the Kor'kron Juggernaut will not longer drop guaranteed upon 6.0?<br />
Slightly different handling there -- the mount will drop 100% of the time on Mythic until Draenor opens. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/484933023721607168))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
whats the thought behind adding those crazy pvp-only items to Ashran? variety and more action packed? some stuff of it scares me yo<br />
.&quot;Crazy&quot; items, spells in Ashran is an opportunity for us to &quot;rewrite the rules&quot; for a short time. It is about variety. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484502805881704449))<br />
By &quot;short time&quot;, do you mean the abilities granted are temporary, i.e. you have to find another book later?<br />
I mean during the life of the expansion, when Ashran is relevant content. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484504028798152704))<br />
<br />
will skirmishes reward Conquest? So we can gear there and then do rated Arenas after?<br />
The conquest acquisition rate will likely be slower than normal unrated battlegrounds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484803690146963456))<br />
<br />
Any chance on having a window to swap specs during arena preparation in WoD? Sometimes certain specs work better against classes.<br />
It would just end up as a mandatory ritual in arenas to bluff you opponents. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484850055984074753))<br />
<br />
I know low lvl pvp isn't priority, but any chance we'll ever see gear options for pvp leveling (honor purchased)?<br />
We want to expand on it, but we won't have the time just yet. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484878562923536385))<br />
<br />
will conquest/honor gear have random tertiary stats on them?<br />
We haven't come to a decision on tertiary stats and pvp gear (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484820076692922368))<br />
<br />
PvP Gear-grind for alts will be better but still potentially tedious when facing conquest-geared opponents in BGs<br />
40 ilevels leaves room enough to feel progression in your gearing without the gap being too large. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484887877042454529))<br />
Think a lot of people would prefer to have less of a sense of progression for sake of alts not being facerolled in BGs<br />
I'm sympathetic to the alt concern but I think 40 ilevels from no gear to full gear is reasonable. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484891424186322944))<br />
Especially when there two tiers of gear in between top and bottom. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/484891729632321537))<br />

We still think a 6.1 patch seems like a pretty reasonable point where flying would become available in Draenor, likely with some kind of aforementioned prerequisite. Maybe it's gold, maybe it's some kind of epic quest, maybe something more straightforward. But we're staying open to changing that post-release if it seems like it's working out really well and we want to keep rolling with it. I'm digging that there seems to be a pretty reasonable mix of beta experiences here though. Definitely looking forward to feedback when we get to the max-level content too.<br />

Nothing lazy about flying in content you already completed. <br />

<br />
I really hope they somehow allow us to move the garrison to another zone at some point.<br />
<br />
In addition, the whole human/orc architecture on everything in the game is getting stale. I understand doing a design for all races might be too much work, but since there's zero lore/story behind it anyway, at least mix it up a bit and use the architecture of two other races.</div></div><hr />

Actually that comment is kinda in the middle. A lot of us like being on the ground more than you think we do. While others... The lazier ones... want to skip fighting trash and just fly to their quest and be done with it. Being on the ground is a lot more fun than it is being put off to be. We are seeing a lot of detail, and it kinda gives you a sense that there are actually other people in the game instead of just flying around seeing empty roads.</div></div><hr />

See my above comment. I love exploration, and I love exploration through FLYING as well. Don't put yourself on a piedestal just because you can enjoy trodding through the same content by ground 10 times and still consider it &quot;exploring&quot;, which is the sense I get from your post and all the people claiming that flying even at 6.1 when we've explored the hell out of the zones will be just for the &quot;lazy&quot; ones. <br />
<br />
I want both, a choice. Flying is no more for the lazy than a ground mount is. If you want to be really genuine, don't use a mount at all.<br />

And in what the hell kind of way is having to go through trash exciting after you've done it x amount of times, and also outgear said trash...? And how the hell does YOUR way of playing get affected if I don't see no reason to trodd through trash that might daze me but still won't pose a threat unless the person dazed is a horrible player?<br />
<br />
If you want to go through the same trash (avoiding it on the ground instead of in air) at 6.1 when we've had the main continent for 2+ months, that's fine with me. By that time I'll have explored the ground level and I'll be itching to explore on the next level.<br />

You and others act as if running around mobs on ground is somehow a matter of prestige...spoiler: It's not. Just check Timeless Isle for a clue.</div></div><hr />

What I don't like is having only 30 mins to play and have to spend half the time travel or even worst then that all the time . Never did understand people thinking they know what's best for others . You play game the way you want and I will shut up and I play the game I want and you shut up. Simple Simple Simple ....

<br />
That feeling will be very short lived once you go through the content more than a few times. I can tell you I skip nothing on any of my character whether or not I can fly. I simple been doing the same exactly thing every since we been given opportunity to fly back in BC. You might have the notion to skip stuff, but flying for me just makes getting around faster and allows me to play all 10 of my current characters more efficiently. People are will not be on the roads, they will be in their garrison. They only people that will be out in the world, which is always very few once everyone has leveled their character and professions. Then the content turns mostly into a ghost land with the only people leveling alts still out in the world. <br />
<br />
People been lazy in this game forever, flying did not change that. People are also creatures of habit and they will be in two main places this coming expansion. The garrison and one of the cities waiting on their queues to pop. While people like myself have to deal with not being able to move quickly through the world. Blizzard is under this fallacy, that if the put enough crap out in the world people are going to change and actually want to be out in the world. Not going to happen at least on the larger scale they are hoping to happen. <br />
<br />
Only reason more people were out at the beginning of MoP, is because they were forced into having to do dailies, otherwise there would have hardly been anyone around in the various zones. Flying also made it more tolerable to do all those dailies. Having to wait about 4 months this time around to jump through some more hoops to make flying feel so uber special all over again, is just lame. You can only strike that kind of lightning the first time, its been part of the game for so long that it is now standard operating procedure. <br />
<br />
Whatever, I will play the song and dance they want to play. All this will really do is make more people level through dungeons, instead of questing. Blizzard and their gating content, when are they going to finally learn.</div></div><hr />

You must be the one that does this sort of thing, I however to do not skip a thing. I am sure that I am not the only one that does this. But if I chose to skip something, it should be my right to do so since it is me that is play their game. I get to choose how I want to experience the content they given me to experience. However forcing me to have to experience it a certain way and have no other option to do so, is not something that should be taking place here. <br />
<br />
They might want me to see and do everything on the ground (which I always do anyway), but that is fine until I have cleared all the content which takes about 3 days max from a questing standpoint. Most of the time it takes less and I do every single quest and explore every bit of every zone available to me. I don't piss around to look at the landscape I can do all that once I get to max level and can fly around an look at from the sky without having to deal with all the obstacles on the ground that get in my way of really looking at the landscape. If for some reason I happen to overlook something (rarely do I miss a thing), I have at least 9 other characters to level through the content. <br />
<br />
Why is wanting to skip trash a big deal to you? Its trash it means nothing more than maybe xp to some and rep to others, after that it serve no purpose what so ever. Once you been through the content a couple times, you get the gist of the content and it is no longer meaningful. Now if you are on a PVP realm this make a lot more problem for your abilities to gank others out in the world. Maybe in the case of PVP realms they should remove flying altogether, that way you can see how many people transfer off those types of realms very quickly that so not wish to be subject to that sort of thing.</div></div><hr />

I have been playing Horde since I started playing some 8 years ago and I am planning on faction changing all 10 to Alliance just because I just do not want those jagged edges and bone spikes. I have also considered just not even bothering with the garrison altogether, but the perks are just going to be enough to make me want to do it. If I feel compelled to do one, I might as well enjoy it from a different perspective.<br />

<br />
Everything is irrelevant once you been through a couple times. Waiting 4 to 6 months is just going to make people leave not stay. There are so few that go out in the world for a very long stay. I should know I am one of those that is always constantly out there and I am on a very high pop realm. Once most people level, they will be in one of two places waiting on a queue to pop. The garrison and/or a city, they wont go out in the world other than to level a profession if they have too. Since we are not going to have a ton of dailies to do, that means even less people out and about. Unless this treasure hunting TI thing gives some seriously good stuff other than toys and buffs, then many won't even bother to leave where they park their butts.</div></div><hr />

I do like the alliance one better even as horde, but when i decided to stay horde in cata, I knew that the horde art wasn't as good for me as alliance art.

People really need to remove their QQ about skipping trash or whatever from questing by flying. We won't be able to fly! How difficult is that to understand?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarethion</div><div class="date">2014-07-14, 01:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion, the biggest issue with flying is that once you get it, it just feels like a massive upgrade over ground mounts and taxis. Provided you're not one of those people who love exploring every nook and cranny, you will always pick flying over other options. I mean, why wouldn't you? It's the fastest and most convenient way of travelling that makes all the alternatives look pale in comparison. So... you fly. It's fun at first, but you kinda hate yourself for skipping a lot of content and as it usually happens with things you do all the time, it gets really boring and frustrating in time. Then you either end up finding a way to make your character fly while you go AFK, or you try to use something else, but while it's fun for a while, you quickly realize that flying is way better and since you've already experienced most of the content anyway, you go back to flying.<br />
<br />
And thus, at some point flying becomes mandatory for almost everyone and other travel methods such as ground mounts and taxis are completely useless. But... What if Blizzard balanced them out? I'm talking about something like:<br />
<br />
1. Flying - convenience at the cost of speed - your movement speed bonus is the lowest out of the three options, but instead you can avoid all the ground obstacles and trash mobs in order to get from point A to any point B completely uninterrupted<br />
2. Ground Mounts - moderate speed and convenience - while you can't avoid mobs and terrain obstacles, you gain a higher movement speed bonus that allows you to reach more accessible locations fastet than via flying<br />
3. Taxi - speed at the cost of convenience - your movement speed is the highest out of the three options and you can avoid everything that's on the ground, but you can use it only to travel to a selected set of locations<br />
<br />
Wouldn't something like this make people alternate between various travel methods? Like - there's a horde of mobs or some other terrain obstacle between you and your objective? No problem, you mount up and take to the air - while you don't move as fast, you still get there faster than via ground mount. But if there's, say, a really nice road between where you're at and where you want to go, you saddle up and ride there because it's faster than flying. Oh, and if you want to go to a different zone or travel longer distances? No problem, you just pick taxi and go make yourself a coffee or whatever. <br />

I believe that having reasons to use all three travel methods would make the game more fun and varied - sure, it wouldn't be as convenient as having OP flying mount, but at least it wouldn't be that boring. And the best thing is - the player would get to decide how he wishes to interact with the content. Personally, I think that would be the best way of tackling the &quot;flying issues&quot; a lot of the people have, because right now... Hell, it doesn't really matter how long they delay the introduction of flying - sooner or later it will come back, because people got spoiled by how convenient it is and once the content starts to get old, masses will demand it and Blizz will give it to them. And once it does come back, most people will skip a lot of content and a lot of issues we might have with flying will return. Nothing gets fixed by delaying flying - the end result is the same, the only question is - how much time it will take before we reach it.</div></div><hr />

Provided you're not one of those people who love exploring every nook and cranny, you will always pick flying over other options. I mean, why wouldn't you? It's the fastest and most convenient way of travelling that makes all the alternatives look pale in comparison. So... you fly. It's fun at first, but you kinda hate yourself for skipping a lot of content and as it usually happens with things you do all the time, it gets really boring and frustrating in time. Then you either end up finding a way to make your character fly while you go AFK, or you try to use something else, but while it's fun for a while, you quickly realize that flying is way better and since you've already experienced most of the content anyway, you go back to flying.<br />
<br />
And thus, at some point flying becomes mandatory for almost everyone and other travel methods such as ground mounts and taxis are completely useless. But... What if Blizzard balanced them out? I'm talking about something like:<br />
<br />
1. Flying - convenience at the cost of speed - your movement speed bonus is the lowest out of the three options, but instead you can avoid all the ground obstacles and trash mobs in order to get from point A to any point B completely uninterrupted<br />
2. Ground Mounts - moderate speed and convenience - while you can't avoid mobs and terrain obstacles, you gain a higher movement speed bonus that allows you to reach more accessible locations fastet than via flying<br />
3. Taxi - speed at the cost of convenience - your movement speed is the highest out of the three options and you can avoid everything that's on the ground, but you can use it only to travel to a selected set of locations<br />
<br />
Wouldn't something like this make people alternate between various travel methods? Like - there's a horde of mobs or some other terrain obstacle between you and your objective? No problem, you mount up and take to the air - while you don't move as fast, you still get there faster than via ground mount. But if there's, say, a really nice road between where you're at and where you want to go, you saddle up and ride there because it's faster than flying. Oh, and if you want to go to a different zone or travel longer distances? No problem, you just pick taxi and go make yourself a coffee or whatever. <br />

I love this idea, personally I'd just as easily be in favor of them saying they are not gonna have flying mounts for the rest of the game from here on out, but this seems like a very reasonable alternative, idea has my support :)</div></div><hr />

I agree. Blood elves make up 30% of all horde players and are actually the largest group. Why are they constantly left out of horde architecture? Honestly garrisons aren't going to be very interesting to me if there aren't any sin'dorei buildings.</div></div><hr />

Before the Beta I was like; ''meh, I'm cool without flying'', but now I seriously hope you'll be able to fly on Draenor at some point during the expansion. The area looks so awesome and I bet it looks even better from the sky. Especially Frostfire Ridge, with all the huge and wide, 'spiky' mountains. Sure you can grab the FP, but the FP doesn't fly across everything in the zone you'd sometimes like to see yourself.</div></div><hr />

I admit some criticism: the absence of artwok and furniture of the other races than the Orcs/Humans in the garrisons is a pity.<br />
<br />
I think that a nice solution could be if some furniture shops were created by Blizzard (the same as barber shops for character but specifically for garrisons), the players would be able to pay some gold to refurnish their garrison buildings and/or the buildings themselves (for instance, the worgen style and the blood elves style are very different).</div></div><hr />

<br />
They totally nailed the Alliance environment, where buildings are located and the feeling you get out of a real garrison.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the Horde Garrison lacks serious L.O.V.E., it seems created on the fly with building and environment placed in random location. I understand the &quot;isolated &amp; desolated&quot; and the &quot;we don't give an F as long as it is functional&quot; mentality of the Horde, but seriously, it's lifeless and I don't understand the thoughts behind it.</div></div><hr />

I completely agree. The players whining the most are the ones that never experienced WoW without flying. Flying is convenient yes and allows the opportunity for some great mount designs but ground mounts immerse the player more into the world. I'm not saying ground mounts&gt;flying mounts, I'm saying that players get more involved when their objective meets obstacles in the way. All these &quot;conveniences&quot; have made gameplay super lazy.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that it isnt a fact, a lot of players either don't feel more immersed with a ground mount or simply dont care that much about immersion.<br />
Besides that: its not about flying perse, its about removing choice (which seems the central theme in WoD), in the current situation ground mount lovers can be immersed in the game as much as they want and at the same time the rest of us who dont care can use a flying mount.<br />
The real question should be is to why you and others want to remove the choice for people that experience the game differently?</div></div><hr />

I don't like the idea of having my choices limited in how I play the game, and I have been playing since 2005.. And having to run everywhere on foot was a pain and the taxi service was a good chance to go to have breakfast, go outside, watch TV.. <br />
<br />
Getting ground mounts at the time was cool allowed me to get somewhere faster although getting dazed and dismounted by mobs was about as much fun as having teeth pulled.. I have been there and pretty much done it all and with flying I have more freedom to see things I could not see from the ground so you may find running around on the ground maybe fun for you but not everyone shares your opinion..<br />
<br />
And the word immersion should be banned different people have differing views on the game some like doing this and others like doing that, forcing people to do things they do not like is a recipe for disaster..</div></div><hr />

<br />
*snip*<br />
<br />
<br />
So you wanted to get from point A to point B but there was a mob in-between so you ran straight though it or close enough to aggro it and instead of taking care of the problem, you chose to ignore it and get dazed. <br />
<br />
The whole point of world mobs is for this very purpose. To pose a threat to the player and to be overcome. If these mobs never pose a threat to you as a player and you can just ignore them by flying over them, then what's the point of having world mobs? Why not just have a single NPC for quests and everything else is instanced? Blizzard came to realize this with WoD so they're making the change. <br />
<br />
Also as Mukki mentioned above, you're contradicting yourself. <br />
<br />
P.S. If blizzard increases the threat in the sky (ex. alot of aerial mobs) some players would find a reason to complain about how annoying flying is. Queue ♫ &quot;It's Raining Men&quot; ♫</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's fun the first time leveling. After that I've seen it, but leveling an alt is a choice and I don't have to do it again if I don't want to. <br />
<br />
Once I'm max level all I care about is prepping for raid, and then after that it's just raiding. Without the short lived Have Group Will Travel, I look at the possibility of no flying past 6.1 as nothing but a pain in the butt. I live in a state that doesn't do daylight savings. Meaning in the summer time I barely have time to get home and log in for raid. If there's much travel time to get to the raids in WoD I'm going to have to park myself outside the instance the night b4 just so I can be there on time the next day. That's not immersive, it's just a giant pain in the butt.<br />
<br />
I understand the rose colored glasses thing with the pre-flying in WoW was great peeps. But, I'm not one of you. I respect your opinion, but if the game still had that design I wouldn't be playing anymore because I just don't have that much time to spend running across a map killing trash on the ground. It's not difficult to kill this trash, it's just annoying. If I wanted to kill stuff just to kill it I'd go farm up another Alani or something.</div></div><hr />

Stop right there. You get exactly the number of choices the game allows you to have--no more, no less. The rules/features can change at any time, and when they do... you get to do exactly what the new rules allow you to do. This is true in any game and it absolutely is &quot;something that should be taking place here.&quot; There is no entitlement to anything from version to version. <br />
<br />
You can't be forced to play the game itself, but if you do, you can be forced to play with any set of rules the designers select.</div></div><hr />

Amen, lmao. People don't seem to understand that the &quot;game&quot; is not theirs. If Blizzard chooses they can change a whole race, the race YOU play, to look like monkeys wearing pajamas. If you don't like, play another game. They're not forcing you to play, you chose to play their game. Deal with it.</div></div><hr />

Except for the nasty little fact that a mentality such as that likely won't bode well with subscription numbers. A good example on a situation that was getting similar comments to this was Ghostcrawler's &quot;Dungeons are Hard&quot; blog. Subs plummeted during that timeframe. It wasn't long after that blog that the dungeons magically got nerfed. Blizz is a company in it for the money, and they will in the end do what nets them the most money in sub numbers regardless of what anyone posts to defend or oppose a change their doing. And since casuals do generally outnumber the hardcore, I have a feeling I know which way it will go in the end.</div></div><hr />

6.1 is perfectly acceptable.<br />

After that I want my ability to fly back. Preferably with a nice quest chain attached.<br />

<br />
Agreed, with the addendum of OR ELSE. <br />

In further news, please stop trying to make me like MOBAs happen. It's not going to happen.<br />

Everybody loves to basically fellate the idea of &quot;Don't like it, don't play, they won't miss you&quot;. That doesn't somehow translate into people enjoying when Blizzard poops all over their favorite things, and it never will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's where you're mistaken. That &quot;favorite thing&quot; was created by blizzard in the first place. If they feel like they need to change it to create a better thing, they will.</div></div><hr />

You just avoided the point by talking about another one. Other game sub numbers are irrelevant. As a business Blizzard holds it in it's best interest to retain as many subs as they can. That's how they make their money. WoW has and probably will remain the king of MMO's if nothing more than time investment deterring people from wanting to start over again. That does not however negate the fact that the playerbase as a whole has gotten older, and many of those players are in fact quitting when they realize they can no longer afford the time investment required to play at the level they want. Things like LFR &amp; Flex were implemented for those reasons, and despite anyone's opinions on them, it helped retain some of those people.<br />
<br />
Numbers will continue to bleed for various reasons and some of those Blizzard simply can't control. But, when it comes to stuff like this, they have historically caved when their numbers dropped. And they'll probably do it again.</div></div><hr />

&quot;People have different views, and since many of you have a view which differs from my own, your view should be banned.&quot;<br />
<br />
Good luck being taken seriously, man.<br />
<br />
No, that's what YOU are saying when you say that flying should be taken away because YOU don't like it.<br />
<br />
He's saying that he doesn't care what you do, you shouldn't care what he does, and that you are trying to ban his view because it's against yours.<br />

I've played WoW since launch, and I can tell you I don't give a damn about immersion. I've had flying for years, I find the areas I can't fly annoying and tedious (not to mention absurd it is that we magically forget how to use flying mounts in certain areas, etc) and quite frankly only want to fly to get from point a to point b as fast as possible, because there's nothing enjoyable about spending time traveling between places. <br />
<br />
People might want to pay attention to 5.4 -&gt; 5.5, because its been 10 months or so so far, and it wouldn't surprise me if it makes it to a year or more, and there's no fucking way anyone is going to be happy going without flying for that long if the wait for 6.1 is even remotely similar.<br />
<br />
I think no flying will probably be the straw that breaks the camel's back for me... it seems to me that Blizzard is constantly nerfing stuff out of some &quot;design vision&quot; and it drives me nuts.<br />
<br />
I remember the first time I tried to bubble on my paladin on Durumu. Why didn't it work? My hunter has to constantly use misdirect on my pet because growl doesn't work on a ton of shit because whofuckingknows. My warlock's pets die almost instantly to some aoe attacks (hunter's too to some extent) because fuck pet classes and how they've worked for years, we want to make shit annoying for you. Oh, you're going to vanish when you see a wipe coming? hahaha, good fucking luck, everything ticks aoe damage now so unless you're really lucky it won't do shit.... and so on, there's so many examples of this and its just really disheartening.<br />
