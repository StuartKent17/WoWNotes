Warcraft III Fan Remake Update<br />
It has been six months since their last video release, but the fan made WarCraft: Armies Of Azeroth mod for Starcraft II is still making progress!<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Is this still a thing that will happen or is planned? http://t.co/qUYPAFlmIB<br />
yes! That happened it's in game now - if you scroll through the different face choices you can see the pose and texture change (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/647592302811021314))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Was removal of threat as an active mechanic in WoW a mistake?<br />
I tanked for a long time and I always found it fun as a tank. I don't think it was as fun for everyone depending on the tank. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647918642982612992))<br />
<br />
I absolutely love Vashj'ir, deep sea exploration that was breath taking, literally. Why the backlash? <br />
IMO the zone was too big and we never quite solved the 3D disorientation and target selection. While realistic, it wasn't awesome. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/647918993160802304))<br />

An announcement about combat changes in Knights of Fallen Empire was posted yesterday, with one of the more interesting features being Level Sync. <br />
<br />
<br />
Players will be scaled down to the target level of the planets they visit, having their stats, armor, and weapon damage reduced, but keeping all of their abilities.<br />
Players also will earn scaled experience, meaning they that if a player is level 60 and is killing level 30 mobs, they will gain experience appropriate for being a level 60.<br />
This means players can return to older content and play it closer to the intended experience, while still progressing their character. <br />

I'm not sure it would suit WoW.. I think SWTOR is more story based so would encourage people to go check out old story content.. where as I can't really see the value in a level 102 WoW player going to the Eastern Plaguelands to quest. I think Blizzard would also feel that the new expansion content is there to be experienced.. not skipped by players who favour running old content..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with that tweet about the character models not living up to the art craft except for the Orcs I suppose. They are all barely better and in some cases are actually worse (the human females still look like they are caught in the headlights or on drugs).<br />
<br />
Regarding scaling your level to old content, it has to be optional, we all like to go back to older content to farm mounts and feel powerful. If you could scale yourself then there would need to be an end game benefit to doing so, like the timewalking dungeons.</div></div><hr />

I think if people were to automatically scale down depending on the zone, you would see a lot more 'authentic' world pvp. You would also be able to scale down and level with a friend if you arent capped if theyre able to get the exp formula right.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, it makes farming a lot less fun. One of the benefits to leveling is being able to go back and obliterate things that used to give you trouble in the past. It gives you that feeling of accomplishment.<br />
<br />
I think the only solution to make just about everyone happy would be that if you are a legit person leveling in that zone, you can be phased only with people within that level bracket. If a high level opts to scale down, they too will be in that phase. Sure the world will look more stark to those who choose not to scale down. But youre likely only there mainly for two reasons- farming or ganking. Neither really adds much dynamic gamplay to those who are leveling in the zone.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, same for me. Sometimes I just like to go to old zones and massacre the bejeesus out of the mobs there, just for revenge. It would suck if everything would always scale for your level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure about the zone scaling. As already noted it could make archaeology a bit of a pain... it might be theoretically fun to go back and &quot;finish&quot; some zones, but I can't really see myself doing that, though I guess others might. I'd be happy for it to be optional.</div></div><hr />

Vashj'ir as a questing zone was awful. AWFUL. Vashj'ir as a place to visit sometimes was barely tolerable. Pacing was all over the place, setting grew stale quickly, targeting was beyond annoying.

Vashj'ir was by far my favourite Cataclysm zone. I can see how some (or most?) people found it annoying, but thematically it was just perfection. <br />
<br />
This might not be a popular opinion, but I think Deepholm was the best zone, it was very different and awesome, and it was HUGE.</div></div><hr />

I loved the story of Deepholme. Really well executed. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2015-10-03, 07:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If zone scaling isn't optional, then hell no. I'd rather talk to an NPC in the main zone town to turn on level scaling. If it was always on with no option to turn it off (like CRZ), I'd be done with WoW. One thing I like about outleveling things is that I can go back to old zones and one-shot everything. I could do things I couldn't do before in some cases such as solo farm Isle of Giants or Timeless Isle for Shao Hao rep. While I'm aware that WoW is an MMO and you should be playing with others, leveling scaling would give Blizzard an excuse to give us even LESS content than now. Why bother giving us anything really new when we have 110 levels of stuff we probably missed? Being forced to find other players to do things or being forced to fight with other players over things isn't my idea of fun. Given Blizzard's tuning of timewalking dungeons, they'd likely undertune us for zones to make them &quot;challenging&quot;, but what they say is challenging I find frustrating and/or boring.<br />
<br />
So bring it on if it's OPTIONAL. Required? Hell no. CRZ is bad enough and needs to go die in a fire. CRZ should have been optional, too.<br />
<br />
I used to play SWTOR back when it first came out. Played for about a year before I quit. Not sure I'll ever return with the zone scaling now. I liked going back to the old planets and doing the dailies there when I outleveled them. I could go fast and pick up mods for alts. Now I'll either have to suck it up and find a group for them or bypass them entirely. Love to know how they scaled some planets that had bonus content after the level of the planet. Alderaan had content after the initial leveling experience as did Hoth that was like 5-10 levels above the initial leveling content. They'd have to do area scaling in that case or they reduced the level of the bonus areas.<br />
<br />
As for Vashj'ir, I actually enjoyed the zone myself. I took all of my toons through it back in Cata (had like 8 level 85s back then) and cursed when Blizzard made Hyjal required for Molten Front. I had few issues with the zone outside of 1 or 2 bugs early on that Blizzard fixed pretty fast. I suppose the fact that we got a free underwater mount helped me want to do the zone although it sucked it was Vashj'ir only. I saw Posedius once and it was BEFORE they put the mount on his loot table. &gt;_&lt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2015-10-03, 08:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vashj'ir also went absolutely nowhere plot wise which doesn't help its case any. It was a really cool concept though. I always kind of wondered if Abyssal Maw would have saved it and where the whole Neptulon thing was going.<br />
<br />
The plot in Vashj'ir was excellent, I don't know how you can say that. It was a great foundation for any eventual Azshara content. I love how everyone is demanding an Azshara expansion, when by all rights it will tie in Vashj'ir heavily. It's one of the better zones, lore wise, how it evolves from pure survival to being part of the main expansion story arc. The bugged sub quests were a shame, but worth waiting to get through. <br />
<br />
I think a lot of WoW players just fear change. They want everything like a vanilla zone - predictable, able to blow through as fast as possible, story has to hit you over the head like a 2x4. It's not the first time they've pulled out all the stops designing a zone, and all they get is &quot;That sucks&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but you're the one that's high. Different people like different things, but I guess you would have never thought of that let alone respect it. My enjoyment of Vashj'ir has nothing to do with &quot;rose-colored goggles&quot;. I take my alts through that zone to this day as I prefer it over Mt. Hyjal. Also, berating and insulting others because they don't feel the same way you do will never win you any friends.<br />
<br />
As for the scaling, as long as they make it optional I'm okay with it. If they make it mandatory I wouldn't be okay with it...at.....all.<br />
<br />
Personally, I prefer the new models over the old ones, but I can see and respect that others might not.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">McNeil</div><div class="date">2015-10-03, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A long time tank here aswell and I liked threat. Back when there were server-communities and you'd perform really well with holding threat, you had a good chance of being asked for more runs with other good people. DPS hated noob tanks that couldn't hold aggro, and back then the mobs could one shot you. I know its not fun for everyone though, but I sure as hell had a lot more fun.<br />
<br />
I don't really get why GC complains about Vash'ir being ''too big'', to me a zone can never be to big. I'm kinda 50/50 myself with this zone, I like how it wanted to be different and its completely optional to quest here, but finding things and fighting under water just isn't done well in this game.<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of level sync in SWTOR and it should be added to WoW as an optional feature, making old content more relevant and adding some extra rewards. CRZ should've been optional aswell.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zarc</div><div class="date">2015-10-03, 09:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, SWTOR is doing level sync? That's awesome, given Blizzard's history of taking good stuff from other MMO's and incorporating it in WoW. Hopefully this is received positively so that they rip it off. I wrote years ago that I wanted this exact feature:<br />
<br />
- When in a contested zone below your level PvP will be optional, with PvP enabled you are automatically scaled to the target level of that zone, and you cannot fly.<br />
- If you disable PvP you will be your real level and, if you are that high leveled, be able to fly.<br />
- Quests will be changed to always grant you XP as a percentage of the level bar rather than fixed numbers.<br />
<br />
The consequence would be this:<br />
<br />
1) World PvP will drastically improve as high-level ganking will disappear. Of course somebody will full raid epics that is scaled down will still have better quality gear than the average leveler on that level, and have more abilities, so he will still probably take most guys 1v1, but the leveler can just call for a friend to come help him and take down the ganker 2v1, whereas currently those two can't do shit against the high-leveled character who will one-shot them.<br />
2) You will still be able to fly over the zone if you are going somewhere, or fly around and herb or mine nodes, or boost a friend who is leveling - you just can't engage in PvP.<br />
3) As you level you can pick and choose more which zones to do, with more choices the higher up you get as more and more zones below your level becomes available for you to go to scaled down, but then again you already have multiple starting areas from 1 to choose from.<br />
<br />
In my view you don't really lose anything of the current game with this exact implementation. It would add more variety and life to the in-game world.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Blackmist</div><div class="date">2015-10-03, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He's spot on with Vashj'ir. WoW simply has no depth cues. You're OK on the ground, because of the targeting circle. As soon as you lose that, you have no idea if something is 10 yards away, or 100 yards away. You just have to move towards it and tap your attack buttons until it works. Not a lot of fun, despite the looks.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocc1f11a099b</div><div class="date">2015-10-03, 10:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think level scalling is a bad idea. What I like about Wow is that you can become really powerful so when you visit old places you can own mobs (i dont speak of pvp, i dont like pvp at all), &quot;take revenge on them&quot; and so on. If there were places, quests, or dungeons that were too hard then its fun to be able to do them easily later on. Same with dungeons and raids - I cant imagine scaling down and having to farm my favourite &quot;hope to get&quot; mount with other people just to lose the roll when it finally drops. Not to mention that it would be hard to find 20 devoted people to run with me old raid every week just to get their even smaller chance for mount. Some old things were too time taking when being on their lvl but become ok to farm when you are high lvl. I dont see it as unfair because you get your items way later after all who wanted got them in the righteous way.<br />
I can see some usage of level scalling if it was totally optional so lets say you may run dungeon with a friend and let him get all the drops and xp or you can choose to scale down to him and do lfg along with him. I cant imagine lvl scaling replacing posibility of runing places on high lvl with a lucky lowbie, it would just suck. <br />
When it comes to Vashj'ir it was one zone that I always avoided besides the very first time I did it out of curiosity. It wasn't too comfortable to play there.

I'd try it out, I suppose. Now that I think about it, I may actually like it, since I'm one of those weirdos who actually enjoys leveling. But the one for SWTOR there doesn't sound optional, and that is completely ridiculous. That would be awful.<br />
<br />
I have always had a mage as my main (so, not a tank) and I absolutely miss threat being something you had to manage. It was an extra thing you had to keep an eye on, and it felt fun to me. I remember the guild I was in for the end of BC and WotLK there was a warlock who had to soul shatter very often because he would be pushing threat a lot. And then he'd have to get a Salv because his soul shatter was on CD. I was usually right behind him. Those were good times when he would accidentally pull the boss off the tank.<br />
<br />
Vash'jir is horrible. It's still the only zone post-Vanilla that I have yet to complete the quest achievement for. I keep putting off going back to it because man fuck that place. I don't like deep sea stuff, gives me the creeps. It's also just a poor gameplay experience with WoW's mechanics.</div></div><hr />

The zone was too big. The first 30 minutes questing there have been fun...but then it became really annoying(even as a caster).

<br />
The zone was very spread out.<br />
<br />
But you know, that was a nice change of pace, to me. I'm tired of places like Outland/Draenor where you go from one biome to a completely different terrain/climate/etc in the span of 25 yards. Vashjir at least felt a little spread out.<br />
<br />
As for movement, that's what the seahorse was for ;)</div></div><hr />

The slow movement due to constantly swimming was a major pain as well and the zone was far from complete - remember that large dead area where the GC Crab was? GC was 100% right when he said they never quite solved 3d disorientation or target selection and that fact prevents Vashj'ir, however good the original intention was, was being classified as a good zone.<br />
<br />
2) GW2 has a very similar level syncing system as the one being implemented in SWTOR and its also game wide - when you are scaled down but retain all your higher level powers you are still stronger then when you levelled initially. It also promotes friends helping friends level, especially with properly adjusted experience points, because its still easier but not the complete joke it is in WoW. A lvl 102 character in WoW going back to a lvl 10 zone is either doing all the killing or not doing anything because they are too powerful - while this may speed things up it doesn't help the new player learn anything/develop skills and is that much more boring for one of the participants. <br />
<br />
It also helps to curb mat botters to some degree because though you are stronger when you are scaled down you are not invincible. Additionally, it somewhat removes the incentive for a high lvl character to endlessly gank low level players and make their lives difficult in the process.<br />
<br />
Overall the pros outweigh the cons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
#1 it fixes the pain of ganking by high-level peeps in lowbie zones, which just drives newer players away. It at least makes the fights reasonably somewhat fair. It needs to be mandatory for that reason, otherwise it's pointless if optional since gankers will simply opt out.<br />
<br />
#2 It actually makes lower level areas fun to go back to for higher-level people either when just looking for stuff to do, or when helping a friend level. Lots of things like events become much more fun if when you go there the content actually feels challenging. <br />
<br />
I know people resist change, but this is one in wow that's loong overdue. This should have been put in place a while ago, and since it's already being done in dungeons I'm sure it would be easy to do from a dev standpoint.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spacehunter</div><div class="date">2015-10-04, 05:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On threat, i miss it because the tanking gameplay that replaced it i find to be significantly less enjoyable than the juggling act of trying to keep threat on multiple mobs. There are just less gameplay decisions to make, and instead i just pound out a rotation and focus on cooldowns. I don't believe this is rose coloured goggles either, it's switching one type of gameplay for another, and i preferred the previous one. <br />
<br />
But i get that most players are shit and the current system is for the greater good. I was always a good tank so the previous system favoured someone like me. If the current one has increased the potential pool of tanks, then that's better for everyone. Worse for me though because it makes me not want to tank. I did enjoy tanking MoP challenge modes on all my tanks though, but dungeon content isn't given the respect in WoW it deserves, so that's kind of a blind squirrel situation on Blizzard's part.<br />
<br />
Scaling to old zones would be sweet. There are a lot of Cataclysm revamped zones i didn't do which i probably never will. Even when i level a new toon the heirlooms make you level so fast and effortlessly that the entire process isn't fun and you feel stupid for not just queuing dungeons all day. It sounds like this system would address that, and if it were in WoW i'd go quest in all of the places to soak up all that story that i've yet to experience.<br />
<br />
Edit: I also loved Vashj'ir but i'm aware i'm in the minority on that too. I generally really like water zones in games. The zone felt quite unfinished though, but i still thought it was heaps better than Hyjal. I wish Blizzard could get their head around the Y axis because it's not just awesome water zones we're being denied, but it's zones where flying could actually be fun gameplay. Sadly we're doomed to walk on the ground for eternity (or skip all the content whenever flying is active).</div></div><hr />

Pretty much this. The other games keep mimicking its features.<br />
<br />
If that sort of world/genre appealed better to western audiences (who are hesitant to pick up an &quot;anime-ish&quot; world, I guess? But 10-year-old-cartoony-wow is okay?) then FF would crush the others based on gameplay and design alone.</div></div><hr />

Corrected that for you.<br />
<br />
The gameplay argument is a matter of perspective. Some people like the 2s gcd better.<br />
<br />
More endgame RAID content is absolutely true...I'm willing to give them time, though. Nobody ever gives new mmo's time and they forget that WoW started with a couple (broken) raids and had months/years to build up an endgame that was worthwhile.<br />
<br />
In terms of interesting/exciting non-raid endgame content, FF has more than WoW has currently. Not saying much, given it's WoD...but.</div></div><hr />

I lve Vashjir as well.Out of all the 90's I have, around 8, only 1 of those guys leveled through Mt. Hyjal. Mt. Hyjal was boring and the same as every other zone ever in WoW. Vashjir's movement was off putting at first but you get used to it very quickly. At least I did anyway. The place was gorgeous too. Currently leveling a fresh alliance warrior.

<br />
Sadly they cannot do that. once you start the new expansion, you cannot go back and do story again on a toon that would actually get down leveled. All stories class and planet are barred from someone that starts their new expansion. Down leveling helps nothing in that area.<br />
<br />
<br />
where as I can't really see the value in a level 102 WoW player going to the Eastern Plaguelands to quest. I think Blizzard would also feel that the new expansion content is there to be experienced.. not skipped by players who favour running old content..<br />
<br />
I think that why so many want optional. Do it either way and let the gamer have fun. If you find few are using the down leveling or have little interest. Well that should tell you something about it.</div></div><hr />

Would be better as optional yet have a griefing/ganking feature.<br />

You gank someone to many levels lower then you. You get level synced turned on for a specific amount of time. Like a deserter debuff.<br />
<br />
Keeps the abillty to have optional level sync.<br />
Hinders PVP ganking with a PVP deserter type debuff.<br />

If they could pull off this, plus removing the problem that is out-leveling zones AND scale quest rewards to match your level they would actually make the entire game world relevant permanently. I'd love to go do them all for the gold and achievements.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Kao</div><div class="date">2015-10-06, 02:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me the by far best level sync system I've seen yet comes from FFXIV. In that game you basically remain on your max level in the open world, if you however choose to take part in events (which are primarily meant for the leveling folks) you need to sync down to the event's maximum level first so that you don't vastly overpower it and steal contribution from others. A similar thing could be done with WoW's PvP in the open world, or when questing in specific areas.<br />
<br />
Dungeons in FFXIV are always synced (much like WoW's timewalker dungeons) when accessed via tool / random daily dungeon, not only to keep them entertaining but also to make it possible for new players to always find a group for those dungeons. That has some notable impact on queue times as, despite having a much lower number of active subscribers, queues are relatively short for almost everyone and everything in that game, as opposed to some ridiculously long or even impossible queues in WoW.</div></div><hr />

Level scaling is just the devs recycling old content and coasting on customer nostalgia. Plus it doesn't make much sense for questing. I mean in a dungeon you could argue that Timewalking let's you 'experience it as it was intended' (which apparently automatically makes it more fun? frankly I didn't find 4 hours in MC all that fun in vanilla or WoD) but out in the world it just means it would take longer to collect 12 boar livers or whatever. <br />

<br />
The whole point is to give another form of content to do at endgame amongst the max level content. Your level scales down so that content is relevant and in the endgame area your level is back up to max so that content becomes relevant. Star Wars, FF14 and Guild Wars 2 each have/will have their own form of level sync and in GW2 and FF14 it's shown that it works quite well. Example- FATE level syncing in FF14 allows everyone to participate on even footing so higher levels don't nuke it down so everyone gets equal contribution.</div></div><hr />

You don't get the feeling of actually getting stronger. Especially since they've already screwed the numbers up by stat squish. If they go through with it, they can pretty much remove leveling for good and give everyone characters with all abilities unlocked.</div></div><hr />

This, I voted for Yes, Always, because I loved that about GW2, every place I went the content was relevant. If we have the option to scale down, the only use I see for that, is to level up with a friend, and not just destroy everything.<br />

Being able to go anywhere in the world for a challenge seems pretty cool to me.</div></div><hr />
