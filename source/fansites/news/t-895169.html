Following the Cataclysm, Ragnaros's elemental minions assaulted Mount Hyjal in a bid to set the ancient World Tree of Nordrassil ablaze. Although the Guardians of Hyjal and their allies heroically repelled this invasion, their work on the sacred mount is far from over. In the newly healed Regrowth, Archdruid Malfurion Stormrage and his comrades have transformed the Sanctuary of Malorne into a staging ground for an assault on Ragnaros's domain: the Firelands. Thus far, their efforts have been frustrated by a resurgence in elemental activity that has engulfed the Regrowth and divided Malfurion's forces.<br />
<br />
If Hyjal's defenders quell this counterattack, they have plans to create a permanent outpost in the Firelands from which to maintain an eternal vigil over the molten elemental realm. To do so, Malfurion's druids are planning to use an enchanted Sentinel Tree. With its roots sunk deep in Azeroth itself, this extraordinary tree's protective canopy will grow in the Elemental Plane, providing a much-needed shelter for the Guardians of Hyjal. Yet accomplishing such a feat will take weeks of brutal fighting against foes such as the treacherous Druids of the Flame, a splinter group of night elves bristling with Ragnaros's fiery powers. Regardless of the many challenges ahead, Hyjal's protectors and other heroes remain steadfast in their goal to establish a foothold in the Firelands. The safety of Hyjal and Nordrassil hinges on the campaign's success.<br />
<br />

<br />
In patch 4.2, stalwart adventurers will have the opportunity to test their mettle at two new daily quest areas located in the fertile hillsides of Mount Hyjal and the burning depths of the Firelands. Known as the Regrowth and Molten Front, these areas will offer an unprecedented amount of daily solo content for level-85 players to enjoy -- including over 60 new quests, four &quot;unlockable&quot; iLevel 365 gear vendors, and a world that evolves right before your eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unlock Your Destiny<br />
<br />
Like many of the daily quest areas already in the game, the Regrowth and Molten Front will feature several stages of content. Players will begin their journeys at the renewed Sanctuary of Malorne in Mount Hyjal, joining forces once again with Matoclaw and Archdruid Hamuul Runetotem to repel invading armies of elementals. From there, they must open a portal directly to the Firelands and establish a forward outpost that the Guardians of Hyjal, led by Malfurion Stormrage, can use to thwart further incursions by Ragnaros's forces.<br />
<br />
Rather than these stages only becoming available after a certain period of time or at the end of a long quest series, players will instead get to use a new alternate currency called Marks of the World Tree to unlock them at their own pace.<br />
<br />
Similar to Champion's Seals from the Argent Tournament in Wrath of the Lich King, Marks of the World Tree can be earned by completing quests located in both daily quest areas. These marks can then be turned in to NPCs to open up individual daily quests, unique daily quest chains (detailed further below), up to four vendors selling a brand-new tier of gear, and important fortifications including a moonwell, an armory, and a legion of Ancients.<br />
<br />
You'll have a lot of freedom in choosing what content you unlock and when, giving you more control than ever over your questing experience. What's more, this element of choice won’t only be reflected in the content you can access, but also in the world around you. As you help Malfurion's druids gain a stronger foothold in the Firelands, you'll start to see new NPCs and structures appear, and the fledgling Sentinel Tree planted at your arrival at the Molten Front will begin to grow into a massive protective canopy.<br />
<br />
(For those who assisted the Shattered Sun Offensive in The Burning Crusade, these types of environment changes will likely feel similar to the transitions that occurred on the Isle of Quel'Danas.)<br />
<br />

<br />
Personal Progression, Personal Gain<br />
<br />
Unlike the Isle of Quel'Danas, though, which unlocked in stages for all players on an entire realm (at the same time), progression at the Regrowth and Molten Front will be completely personal. Your actions will have a direct impact on what quests you'll unlock next, and how each hub will evolve visually.<br />
<br />
To ensure that friends can play together even if they're not progressing identically, we've avoided separating players through phasing for all but a couple individual quests. The hub may look very different from one player to another, but they can all still adventure together. No matter where you are in the progression, the Sentinel Tree will be alive and thriving with fellow defenders of Mount Hyjal!<br />
<br />
<br />
I Choose You, Druids of the Talon! (Or maybe you, Shadow Wardens!)<br />
<br />
Within the Regrowth and Molten Front daily quest areas, players will have numerous options, both in terms of the content they unlock and what quests they might play through on a daily basis. One of the first places players will get to experience this type of &quot;modular&quot; gameplay is near the entrance to the Molten Front, in the forward base known as Malfurion's Breach.<br />
<br />
In addition to your normal duties at this outpost, you'll also be asked to secure the aid of two benevolent orders stationed in Mount Hyjal: the Druids of the Talon, led by Skylord Omuron, and the Shadow Wardens, a fierce group of night elves under the guidance of Captain Saynna Stormrunner. This will be a pivotal point in your progression within the Molten Front and represents the first big unlock of new content for the area.<br />
<br />
To secure the allegiance of the druids and wardens, you'll need to collect Marks of the World Tree to present to each order's leader. Once you've gained the appropriate amount of marks and turn them in, you'll unlock a unique set of daily quests tailored to either the Druids of the Talon or the Shadow Wardens. If you unlock the Druids of the Talon dailies, your journeys will take you into the shadow of the Furnace, an area wreathed in constant flame; the Molten Flow, a river of lava inhabited by flamewakers for as far as the eye can see; and Fireplume Peak, a floating island protected by hot-tempered fire hawks. If you opt to unlock the Shadow Warden dailies, you'll lay siege to the Forlorn Spire, wresting it from the enemy's grasp and establishing a new forward outpost. From there, you’ll be poised to attack the Widow’s Clutch, the breeding grounds for hordes of fire spiders, and Wildflame Point, a base of operations for the nefarious Druids of the Flame.<br />
<br />
Once you've recruited both the Druids of the Talon and the Shadow Wardens, you'll have the option to choose which set of daily quests you complete each day. You'll only able to be complete one set of daily quests per reset (either the Druid of the Talon dailies or the Shadow Warden dailies), but the choice of which path you take is up to you.<br />
<br />

<br />
Variety is the Spice of Life<br />
<br />
Earlier, we mentioned that over 60 new quests would be available at the Regrowth and the Molten Front. Since this is quite a lot of content -- almost half a zone's worth! -- many of these quests will be randomized into smaller groups. Out of 15 possible quests at a certain hub, for example, you might be able to pick up between three to five each day. This should help keep the content feeling fresh and fun, and your daily quest load a lot more manageable.<br />
<br />
This randomization will also play off the environment. On one day, you may be tasked to bolster the defenses outside of Malfurion’s Breach against an onslaught of Molten Giants. On another, you'll be pitted against lava worms that have surfaced throughout the outpost. These quests will be based on the events taking place around you and are likely to change daily.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rewards? I Love Rewards! Hippogryphs all around!<br />
<br />
You'll be rewarded handsomely for your efforts in these embattled regions. In addition to all the new gear you'll be able to purchase from the unlockable vendors, you'll also receive an additional set of rewards upon opening up all the available content at both daily quest areas.<br />
<br />
Players who take on this task will be presented with a stunning Flameward Hippogryph (shown below), as well a special one-time quest line that will explore the origins of Leyara, the powerful Druid of the Flame who commands the Firelord’s forces at the Regrowth and Molten Front, and why her hatred for Malfurion Stormrage burns so brightly.<br />
<br />

<br />
After years of preparation and maneuvering, the Firelord's power is now potent enough to threaten Azeroth with a devastating invasion. The Guardians of Hyjal will require the aid of the mightiest heroes to have a chance of survival. You've heard their call -- will you answer?<br />

The Firelands - Not enough content?<br />
Yes, Firelands is the raid in 4.2, and 7 is the total number of bosses.<br />
<br />
We think 7 is our current ideal for number of bosses in a raid. (We launched Cataclysm with two full raids of 4-6 bosses each.) We're also spending a lot of time making the Firelands bosses as awesome as possible - - creating unique models, animations, effects, sounds, etc. etc. Previously a lot of bosses were larger versions of existing models, which was fine, but that tradeoff is made somewhere. We shift to making fewer but more epic boss fights and there's a tradeoff somewhere. We're concentrating our efforts into a smaller number of fights so that each fight is bigger and better, they're still obviously going to be extremely challenging, but once it is on farm you're not having to spend two, three, maybe four nights just to clear it because the raid is so huge.<br />
<br />
Our ideal situation would, of course, be to launch as many raids as possible with this current ideal number of around 7 bosses, but that's not something we're ever going to promise. We'd love to be able to produce unlimited amounts of content anywhere, not just raids, for that matter. We think one raid per patch with around 7 bosses is a super solid experience, though, especially with how much effort is going into Firelands. We don't think anyone is going to be disappointed.<br />
<br />
On a side note, the whole daily quest thing hasn't sparked much excitement yet, but with the preview going live here in a few hours (and BlizzCast 16) hopefully we can impress how awesome that's going to be, too.<br />
<br />
Again, there's a pretty aggressive development cycle for 4.2, so it's not going to be very long before we're on the PTR, and not very long (comparatively) before release. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172377/that-it))<br />
<br />
Firelands Raid - Only 7 Bosses?<br />
Yeah, I mean that's a tough situation because our feeling is simply that people shouldn't be forced to play the game more than a couple nights a week to keep up on progression. We realize though that some people legitimately like playing every night, and having real reasons to be in the game and playing with raid groups and such. There's obviously things like alts, professions, achievements, PvP, to keep people busy, but it's ultimately something we'd like to get a better handle on. Having content that isn't forcing people to log in every night, but still offering something that's meaningful for those that do. Understand though that by definition those types of things can't lead to player power or else everyone will be back to having to log on every single night to keep pace. Anyway, it's something we very much want to get a better handle on, but it's not something we're going to solve easily. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172377/that-it))<br />
<br />
[...] I think the thing to probably take away from this is that content is not infinite, and so we have to look at everyone who plays the game and try to be smart about where we focus this finite pool of development resources we have.<br />
<br />
As someone else very astutely mentioned earlier, Sunwell had 6 bosses, and I remember people being outraged that they were gated to unlock over time to stretch out that content. Firelands has 7 bosses and they aren't gated. We hope people enjoy them as much, and will be able to look back as fondly on it as they do on Sunwell. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172377/that-it))<br />
<br />
Molten Front Dailies and Rewards<br />
Well, someone doing the dailies every day will certainly achieve the rewards faster than someone who doesn't... But there's no comparison between coordinating 10 or 25 people to put all their concentration into the game for many hours a night, multiple nights, and someone choosing to log in and do a few quests by themselves every day. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172377/that-it))<br />
<br />
Dungeon Journal<br />
If you're speaking at all about boss encounters, I think you'll dig the Dungeon Journal (formerly referred to as Encounter Journal) coming in patch 4.2. Once we're able to catalog more of our dungeons in this journal, you'll get a lot of essential information for each boss fight. It's not going to tell you how to beat the fight, but it's going to tell you what kind of abilities the boss will be using against you. You'll just have to figure out with your party or raid how to deal with those abilities when they're used. Dungeon Journal will also help you find the loot you're looking for from each boss ahead of time, so you have items in mind you hope to get before even setting foot in the dungeon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172356/why-is-research-required-for-this-game))<br />
<br />
Engineering - Rocket Fuel Leak<br />
&quot;Rocket Fuel Leak&quot; was specifically meant as an alternative failure for dungeons, raids, and battlegrounds so we weren't launching people up into unknown invisible (or otherwise) roofs and getting them stuck or allowing content exploitation. In 4.1 it was fixed so that this failure was actually properly going off in these specific types of content.<br />
<br />
Reevaluating the damage though, we're going to apply a hotfix to bring it down quite a bit (it won't be able to kill you outright anymore). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172334/why-do-nitro-boosts-kill-you-now))<br />
<br />
New Content - Quality over Quantity<br />
I think you're right, though. We've trended toward choosing quality over quantity with some of our content creation, and while that isn't usually a bad thing, it's rarely a good thing from a perception point of view. I think that's something we realize but - - and this is sort of a difficult concept to get across sometimes - - is that the game is... really big, and by the laws of physics really big things don't change direction very quickly. Depending on which part of the development team or individual developers you're talking about, they could be working on content we won't even announce until six months later. Maybe longer. That's just the necessity of our development to ensure we're getting patches and expansions out. So these types of evaluations of what direction the game is in and any changes or general philosophy we want to alter, we may begin making a course correction, but we're just not able to hit that new heading until the entire ship finishes turning. It's also not too rare that in the middle of altering our direction, we change our minds.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I don't want that to be discouraging because it's not true of all things, but it is generally true of things like planning patch content which takes many, many months of development. And even then, like I said, things can change midway, but that's not always a bad thing. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172377/that-it))<br />
<br />
Goblins and Worgens missing /roar sound<br />
You don't like it when we take stuff away from you!? ;P<br />
<br />
So the actual issue was that there was a bug where emote /attacktarget for goblin and worgen played the sounds associated with both /roar and /attack at the same time, which sounded broken. Since no other race but goblin and worgen have roar sounds, the fix for the bug was to make them behave the same as all other races by removing the sounds.<br />
<br />
I know, I know, but it's done. OR IS IT!?<br />
<br />
Obviously people miss their roar sounds. What we're going to do is hook the goblin/worgen roar sounds back up in a 'future patch' (it's not hotfixable), hurray, and then attempt to record /roar sounds for all the other races to add to the game in a patch after that.<br />
<br />
Goblin/worgen, unfortunately lose their roars for a short while, but in the end everyone wins! Or at least roars. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/172336/why-arent-worgen-making-sounds-when--roaring))<br />
<br />
Cannot /dance while in Combat<br />
Dancing while in combat was disabled to fix some unfortunate animation bugs. For example, several races do a torso twist as part of their special attack animation, and that would go haywire when the character was also trying to dance.<br />
<br />
Part of what makes WoW a compelling experience is the sense of immersion in this alternate world, and that is a sense that can be disrupted by graphic glitches.<br />
<br />
We definitely hear the outcry over the dancing in combat. Our tactic is going to be to try to let characters dance while they are in combat, and always break the dance when a foe is engaged (so you could dance while in combat, but only when your character is idle). We are just starting to investigate this solution, but I can assure you that it is being evaluated. I’ve heard that directly from the mouths of the devs.<br />
<br />
Having said that, we realize there are plenty of other areas in the game where the art can get into a less than optimal state, and nobody should assume that we just don’t care about those – they are all on the radar.

That reward is based on doing dailies, tons of them. We don't know what's the minimal ammount of time needed to get that mount. <br />

Also, I understand the idea behind quality over quantity, but I'm concerned that the guilds running 4.2 in full 372 will be done with content within a month, and have to stand around for another 7 months just farming Firelands for the legendary staff mats. Usually this is the case with the top world guilds, but I'm afraid that this will encompass a much larger portion of the raiders than normal.</div></div><hr />

Only thing wrong with AD dailies was the jousting, the rest of the dailies were easy. It was easy to get decent loot as well, so I welcome this. If you dont like dailies your wont like any of the quests the introduce, but id rather do AD dailies than IoQ dailies.</div></div><hr />

I was mostly referring to ZA/ZG, but Firelands also has reused bosses ranging from the obvious Ragnaros to the other one that looks like Supremus all over again. The Firelands raid is new, but the fact there are only one instance and 7 bosses is underwhelming to say the least. Maybe I was spoiled by TBC, but I was led by Blizz to believe Cata would be going back to that same amount of raid content again. This is half of that.</div></div><hr />

And the explaination is even more ridiculous. Because their creating unique models? Yeah, it's not like they haven't done this before like in..... every T11-Fight besides Double Dragons. Guess it's ok. Ok, I might be bored after a handfull of weeks like I was in T9, but hey: All the bosses have nice models... Oh no wait: It because they don't want people to play every night. Ah, they're just wanting the best for us. It's not because they want to save developement time (money!) or saving even more money with less people playing at the same time. It's just because they want us to stay healthy and fine. The only thing which tops blizzards promises are blizzards apologies...<br />
<br />
First, they promise to go back to the bc model which was great. And now they're cutting half of the content. It's a shame.<br />
And quality above quantity? Firelands will be as good or bad as every other major raid since BC, nothing more and nothing less. And after a couple of weeks, everything is on farmstatus and we're bored untill 4.3 - which will probably just the war of the ancients raid.<br />

I wasn't talking about SWP, that was at the end of the expansion and on par with Ruby Sanctum in WotLK with the big bad guy already dead and everyone waiting for the next expansion. TBC's equivalent of 4.2 had SSC/TK and HyjaL/BT, essentially two Firelands per tier.<br />

Tbh I doubt it's laziness and more the fact of well, what ELSE can they release during 4.2? I mean you're all complaining cause it's only one raid, 7 bosses. Do we even know how the fights are going tio go down? If there isn't going to be something to make it be the equivalent of two raids in one? And well back to the point of, WHAT ELSE COULD BE COMING OUT AS A RAID. I mean, we can't raid Deathwing yet. People are still working on the raids we currently have. I mean you and the rest are acting like all guilds that are progressing have already gotten the fights to be faceroll.<br />
<br />
So mister smarty pants, what other raids could be released with Firelands?<br />
<br />
Oh I know, lets dump oil into Vash'jir and SET IT ON FIRE. And then RAID VASH'JIR. WHILE IT IS ON FIRE.</div></div><hr />

There are ENOUGH options to create a raid. Don't defend blizzards economizations. It's not like they haven't got any other option. They just don't want to. Instead, they want to sell less content for the same money. Most parts of there team is probably working on a new addon which they can sell again for 30 Bucks instead of creating content for the current one, as they promised. <br />
<br />
I've bought Cataclysm because they told that they will go back to the BC Model of raiding. But now instead of offering more raids with less bosses, they just offer less raids with less bosses.</div></div><hr />

Agree'd, the mentality of most (but not all) the player base seems to fall in line with &quot;All the mounts of this game should belong in raids and no where else so we can be special 100% of the time.&quot; Because as we know apparently the armor, achievements, titles, and every thing else connected to the heroic raids they down with their guild are absolutely worthless next to the mount they only use to show off on. :) Theres an idea, place a greed check in raids. If they complete the achievements for the mounts they have to forfeit everything they earned up until that point. (Only half joking)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bingo. They just flat-out said that players are only going to get one 4-7 boss raid per tier.<br />
<br />
Everyone who is excited by Blizzard's descriptions of the raid/daily hub should go back and read their descriptions of the talent system revamp. Remember how we were going to have tons of choices in each tree, no two Fire Mages would need to be spec'd exactly alike, we'd pick talents based on play style, and everything was supposedly going to be far less cookie cutter? Remember how that turned out?<br />
<br />
Right. Blizzard has a PR department for a reason. &quot;Mini-raids from here on out&quot; was the big new development, they just waited to reveal that fact in the middle of a Patch 4.2 PR fest. Smart business decision, but not good news for players no matter what perspective you look at it from (raider, casual, scrub, noob, elitist, neckbeard, whatever).</div></div><hr />

<br />
If 4.2 is out on the PTR within a month and live by the end of July I can forgive the delay. With the whole legendary quest line and daily quest hub stuff, it looks like there was more work than just a 7 boss instance, not to mention internal testing and design. <br />
<br />
I am worried about the lack of content though. While everything they've released so far can still keep most people busy until 4.2, when that raid tier hits it won't last long. The next tier would have to come out in october/november at the latest in order for there to still be interest. There's no way you can stretch 7 bosses longer than 4 months, as either everyone would have farmed the instance to death by that point. If you haven't gotten the instance on farm, then you'd either be sick of it b/c you've been stuck on Fandral Staghelm for 2 months and you don't have any other options for bosses to work on. Also, it seems like with only 7 bosses they'd have to increase the amount of loot per boss, as the loot tables will be much bigger. If not then there's going to be even bigger problems when all you see is pally healer loot week after week.<br />
<br />
You can call me a blizzard fan boy, b/c I have faith that they know what their doing. However, one wrong move and this tier will fall flat on its face like ToC did. I'm hoping for the best b/c I enjoy playing this game, but all these moves seem to be the opposite of what you want to do in order to retain a strong subscription base. Lack of content, long delays between content release, and underwhelming content are what destroy mmos in the long run.<br />

i agree with what you're saying, look at 4.1 for example 2 recycled instances i know ZG is changed a bit, but ZA is identical with a few minor changes, and how long was that on the PTR for 2-3 months? i highly doubt blizzard is going to have 4.2 out before the end of June honestly, it almost feels like they are purposely testing the limits of the Blind faith all these players still have left in blizzard, to find the limit and keep doing that over and over, this blind faith is the cause of blizzard's sudden lack of quality or quantity within all of Cataclysm Thus far, and i feel if everyone keeps accepting it as &quot;they are doing their best&quot; then nothing will improve and the rest of the expansion and all future expansions will be a pathetic footnote in the life of a Once Good Game.</div></div><hr />

Maybe because what you say is untrue? Or do you have sources inside Blizzard?. Think about it. Why would a multi million dollar company risk to offend their customer base by saving a buck and employing B class people? Save 1 million bucks by skimping on wages and firing people and lose 15 million bucks because a million subscribers quit? It might show how YOU would run a business, but after releasing awesome games for 15 years, my trust is in Blizzard. Plus: As everyone else, some game designers have a knack for fantasy, others for SciFi and others for Worldwar games - and it is the job of company leaders to employ them where they are best suited. Some might actually ASK to be placed on a different project that suits them better.<br />
<br />
Apart from that..I am looking forward to those dailies and 4.2, but first there is ZG and ZA to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which did 4.1 have? Cos it sure didn't have quantity, and it sure didn't have quality, given the ridiculous and quite frankly embarassing amount of bugs. Just like every other patch in recent memory. Hot fixing is surely the worst innovation ever created, it has just bred into Blizzard a mentality of not having to bother testing patches when they can release it to Live and let us find their bugs for them. <br />
<br />
I'm a long-term WoW player and my reasons for bitching up to this point have been minimal, but this last while has done nothing but reinforce the fact in my mind that Blizzard seem to be dragging out WoW as much as possible, making the least effort possible in order to retain it's subscribers, making us do their work for them. <br />
<br />
If it continues, I'll be joining the uncomfortably large numbers of people quitting the game. In other words, Firelands better be as fucking good as they say. It better be Karazhan or Ulduar 2.0.<br />

<br />
<br />
Tier 4/5 raids (WoW 2.0 - The Burning Crusade) January 16th, 2007 <br />
Karazhan - 10<br />
Gruul's Lair - 2<br />
Magtheridon - 1<br />
Serpentshrine - 6<br />
Tempest Keep - 4<br />
Total: 23<br />
<br />
Tier 6 raids (WoW 2.1 - The Black Temple) May 22nd, 2007<br />
Black Temple - 9<br />
Hyjal - 5<br />
Total: 14<br />
<br />
Tier 6 &quot;filler&quot; raid (WoW 2.3 - The Gods of Zul'Aman) November 13th, 2007<br />
Zul'Aman - 6<br />
Total: 6<br />
<br />
Tier 6.5 raid (WoW 2.4 - Fury of the Sunwell) March 28th, 2008<br />
Sunwell Plateau - 6<br />
Total: 6<br />
<br />
<br />
Seeing that Cataclysm was launched with a total of 12(+1 heroic only) raidbosses, with the following raid content patch providing 7 raid bosses, it feels like we're getting just half the content. But are we really? TBC did not have hardmode versions of the bosses, so you might say that each encounter in this expansion might count as two encounters - just for the sake of comparing the amount of content.<br />
If we take this into account, then we are really experiencing the exact same amount of content that TBC gave us, allthough it doesnt really feel like that is the case because we raid the same location twice. <br />
<br />
To toss another argument into this debate; the initial raidcontent of Cataclysm offers heroic modes that are slight variations of the normal mode encounters (i.e. a few added mechanics, stuff hits harder and is more unforgiving, but in essence it's the same fight) so everyone might not count these encounters as a &quot;two in one&quot; kind of deal, but Blizzard is now saying that the heroic mode encounters in Firelands are supposed to be completely different than their normal mode counterparts, meaning that we're actually getting 14 new bosses to try our wits on. Exciting :)<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents, overall I look forward to this patch. It looks very promising; loads of content for most players, totally new art/mobs/models, new raid and new zone, and omg the legendary!<br />
Sweet! Bring it, Blizzard! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Actually, when you look at it, 4.2 Firelands is just like 2.4 Fury of the Sunwell. You get a new zone with dailies, and a raid. The tradeoff is that 2.4 introduced a 5man instance as well, whilst 4.2 introduces a raid with heroic modes. Everyone loved the 2.4 patch, I predict the same will happen again (as long as the bosses live up to it, I presume that heroic Ragnaros will be quite the fight).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duster505</div><div class="date">2011-04-29, 10:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">If 4.2 is out on the PTR within a month and live by the end of July I can forgive the delay. With the whole legendary quest line and daily quest hub stuff, it looks like there was more work than just a 7 boss instance, not to mention internal testing and design. <br />
<br />
I am worried about the lack of content though. While everything they've released so far can still keep most people busy until 4.2, when that raid tier hits it won't last long. The next tier would have to come out in october/november at the latest in order for there to still be interest. There's no way you can stretch 7 bosses longer than 4 months, as either everyone would have farmed the instance to death by that point. If you haven't gotten the instance on farm, then you'd either be sick of it b/c you've been stuck on Fandral Staghelm for 2 months and you don't have any other options for bosses to work on. Also, it seems like with only 7 bosses they'd have to increase the amount of loot per boss, as the loot tables will be much bigger. If not then there's going to be even bigger problems when all you see is pally healer loot week after week.<br />
<br />
You can call me a blizzard fan boy, b/c I have faith that they know what their doing. However, one wrong move and this tier will fall flat on its face like ToC did. I'm hoping for the best b/c I enjoy playing this game, but all these moves seem to be the opposite of what you want to do in order to retain a strong subscription base. Lack of content, long delays between content release, and underwhelming content are what destroy mmos in the long run.<br />

This, Omnitron and AoE Reticules are pissing off a lot of raiders atm. They don't fix those raid-ending bugs soon the PvEers will be joining the PvPers in demanding blizzard's head.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is gonna solve the &quot;to few bosses in 4.2 by making them extra hard so it takes about 2-4 weeks to kill each one. And it will be balanced so that you will not be able to do the normal modes of it unless you have killed most of the T1 heroic versions. <br />
<br />
Its cheap solution ofc... but it saves BLizzard money - and design work. <br />
<br />
So be prepaired from now on to run both heroic and normal bosses of every raid tier if you want to progress at all. PPl can make up their mind now if they really want that. If not then just dont pay BLizzard the sub for beeing lazy.<br />

<br />
Quality over quantity means you fight the same boss in 2 modes ... Hence - you still have the quantity but just lazy version of it. And it has nothing to do with QUality. Ask those trying to do Omnitron atm after 4.1</div></div><hr />

It might be more useful to think of 4.1a = Zul'Gurub, Zul'Aman, 4.1b = Firelands. Blizzard for some reason decided that while the players weren't ready for the raid yet, they'd be grateful to receive the rest of it earlier. I don't see them making the same mistake again :)</div></div><hr />

Or do you have sources inside Blizzard?. Think about it. Why would a multi million dollar company risk to offend their customer base by saving a buck and employing B class people? Save 1 million bucks by skimping on wages and firing people and lose 15 million bucks because a million subscribers quit? It might show how YOU would run a business, but after releasing awesome games for 15 years, my trust is in Blizzard. Plus: As everyone else, some game designers have a knack for fantasy, others for SciFi and others for Worldwar games - and it is the job of company leaders to employ them where they are best suited. Some might actually ASK to be placed on a different project that suits them better.<br />
<br />
Apart from that..I am looking forward to those dailies and 4.2, but first there is ZG and ZA to play.<br />
<br />
Yes... why would a multi million dollar company leave their milking cow with a group of B class skeletal crew dews? Maybe because they are not gonna be updating the basics systems at all in the future ? Cause they are gonna put it on a shelf as the thing that came before Titan ? <br />
<br />
Blizzard themselfs is already talking down WOW. They talk of Titan as the game that will take all WOW subs. YEs....that is their goal. It says alot about what themselfs are thinking for the future of WOW. And as a 12 million sub based game.. that is simply not acceptable. And WOW subscribers should stop paying right now to let BLizzard know that nothing other than full comitment to WOW will do for a 12 million sub based game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gee, you are so full of it. <br />
Please provide a source on the information regarding Blizzard wanting to move all subs from WoW over to Titan? I thought so.<br />
<br />
By what we know Titan is an MMOFPS or something along those lines, and is placed in a sci-fi universe. This is so far from Wow that it makes no sense trying to port their customerbase over to this IP. Try to consider this from a business perspective, it makes no sense at all. Why would they stop developing World of Warcraft when it makes up 89% of Blizzard's annual income? (Source (http://wow.joystiq.com/2011/04/22/the-lawbringer-lets-read-activision-blizzards-2010-10-k-annua)).<br />
<br />
Titan is a new IP, and maybe even a sort of new game genre. Draining WoW of its customers will not be its goal at all, your allegations are based on nonsense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which did 4.1 have? Cos it sure didn't have quantity, and it sure didn't have quality, given the ridiculous and quite frankly embarassing amount of bugs. Just like every other patch in recent memory. Hot fixing is surely the worst innovation ever created, it has just bred into Blizzard a mentality of not having to bother testing patches when they can release it to Live and let us find their bugs for them. <br />
<br />
I'm a long-term WoW player and my reasons for bitching up to this point have been minimal, but this last while has done nothing but reinforce the fact in my mind that Blizzard seem to be dragging out WoW as much as possible, making the least effort possible in order to retain it's subscribers, making us do their work for them. <br />
<br />
If it continues, I'll be joining the uncomfortably large numbers of people quitting the game. In other words, Firelands better be as fucking good as they say. It better be Karazhan or Ulduar 2.0.<br />
<br />
And yes, I'm still hoping Blizzard prove me wrong and that they aren't the slackers they seem to have been becoming recently.<br />
<br />
Because of the ppl who joins the PTR not to test? I bet ppl who joined the PTR test never went to BWD/BoT/TotFW to test it. They just went to ZG/ZA to get the fights, test the timed run, to do it on live &quot;first&quot;. Do you see bugs in ZA/ZG? Nope.<br />
<br />
That's why I'm totally against PTRs, they are just used to get spoilers/strats for new boss fights for world's/realm's 1st (or professions/characters maxlvl 1st's strats for xpac betas), so, decreasing the life time of a patch on live. Just a few players actually test and search for broken stuff.<br />
<br />
If they're coming with all this new &quot;QD isle&quot; thing each major patch and a raid with 7 bosses that are unique fights (with the possibility for normal and heroic modes totally diferent), it's ok and it IS quality over quantity. So, the only way they will screw it is by having only 7 bosses and with well know and overused mechanics + the usual &quot;dificult reset with retarded boss 1, 2, 3, 4, little better boss 5, 6, decent boss 7&quot; instead of bosses that are harder than most of the T11 tier. No need for &quot;entry level bosses for ppl who just dinged maxlevel this patch&quot; like they did in wrath with only 7 bosses.<br />

Sweet! Bring it, Blizzard! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Actually, when you look at it, 4.2 Firelands is just like 2.4 Fury of the Sunwell. You get a new zone with dailies, and a raid. The tradeoff is that 2.4 introduced a 5man instance as well, whilst 4.2 introduces a raid with heroic modes. Everyone loved the 2.4 patch, I predict the same will happen again (as long as the bosses live up to it, I presume that heroic Ragnaros will be quite the fight).<br />
<br />
You guys forget the amount of time between the releases. Also the atunments. You couldn't set your feet in TK/SSC unless you did the atunement (wich had to do with prior raids), the same for BT/Hyjal, even one boss in Karazhan had a atunement quest chain. We didn't get Black Temple a few months after TK/SSC. The TBC expansion by itself took a way lot more time to release unlike the Wotlk/Cataclysm too.<br />
<br />
ZA was designed as a T5 equivalent raid for 10man groups (since they felt like having a &quot;Karazhan like&quot; thing for T5/T6), not a T6. Only the timed event was designed for players alread in BT/Hyjal, but the overall raid was T5 level (with T5 level drops). So it could be looked at a let down since ppl were alread enjoying T5 and T6 content, but again, atunments and harder encounters hold most of the players at karazhan.<br />
<br />
From the 10 bosses in karazhan, you didn't actually had 10 &quot;WOWMGSOAWESOMEHARD&quot;, some were very stupid/easy (huntsman... and chess is a boss?). But since you had all those raids together and huge atunements holding you back, we aways forget about those loot pinatas (now called VoA/BH bosses).<br />
<br />
From Black Temple (with the &quot;should be&quot; last boss in the expansion), we had a huuuuuuuuge waiting until the next expansion. Wich we didn't had in WotLK even without taking into account the ICC wings opening one after another instead of all at once.<br />
<br />
And forget about comparing &quot;normal mode&quot; TBC raids with the current normal + heroic system. What happens is that what is labeled as &quot;heroic&quot; mode today would be most of the &quot;normal&quot; modes in TBC. What we had there was a mix of &quot;normal mode&quot; bosses for &quot;easy loot&quot; and &quot;heroic mode&quot; bosses in the same raid. TBC model applied on Cata raids, you would get something like Halfus on normal, than the next boss would alread be Valiona/Theralion Heroic (and you would NOT have the option to set to normal), followed by Council heroic and Cho'gall heroic. Magmaw and maybe Ominotron normal with the rest on heroic in BWD, both in heroic in Throne of the Four Winds (considering that we still had BH boss, if not, the 1st boss in TofTW would be normal mode). Most of the heroic modes with a little nerf here and there since you had no option other than fight them at &quot;heroic&quot;.<br />
<br />
So far, they're not doing bad with Cataclysm, altough I think ZA is a big let down. Used to tought that about ZG too, but after checking the instance, it's way better, they really did planned all along with ZG, but not with ZA (we don't even have a damn quest saying that ZA is back, unlike ZG! Unless I miss something in a text in one of the quests for ZG that mention something in ZA worth of going there to check the place for suspicious troll activity). ZG = &quot;re-used name/location&quot;, ZA = &quot;re-used instance&quot;. Worse for ZA that we have all the stuff that happened in Zul'drak about the ZA troll gods now free, that screws the ZA story for some bosses comeback.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Therec</div><div class="date">2011-04-29, 12:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get the arguments about BC, but the raiding scenario was completely different back then. You had to gear up through each tier, and before you could go on to the next tier you had to be attuned to the dungeon. All this caused most guilds to be playing catch-up throughout the xpac. If you wanted to start an alt you had to start at the beginning and work your way through the tiers again to get back up to where your main was.<br />
<br />
This expansion by the time 4.2 comes out half the guilds will overgear normal modes. That is the reason I don't really count normal modes and heroics as being 2 separate boss sets. They are when you actually have to make an effort to beat them, not when your gear is so high already from the previous tier that you can blow through normal modes in a week or two. That coupled with the fact that most everyone will be able to gear their alts up to the point of 4.2. Another thing, back in BC if you were struggling in SWP or god forbid ZA, you could go back to Hyjal and BT and get more gear. At this point there won't be any reason to go back to do BoT or BWD, so if your stuck at a boss in Firelands, um I guess you could do some dailies on an alt. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong I want this to work, I just don't believe there's going to be enough content to keep players interested for another 6-8 months after 4.2.</div></div><hr />

Firelands has more bosses than 7 TBC raids. Also, ask yourself one question: how long did it take from BT to SWP...only to get 6 bosses?<br />
<br />
The thin here is tho, that Karazhan, Serpentshrine Cavern, The Eye, CoT: Battle for Mount Hyjal, Gruul's Lair &amp; Maghteridon's Lair were all available at launch. Which is 28 bosses from the get go and now we have 12 + 2 (Argaloth &amp; Sinestra) to start with and people are getting bored. Even with Firelands out, the number is going up only to 19 + 3 (Argaloth, Sinestra and the new push-over) in total which is still less with what The Burning Crusade Launched. <br />
<br />
Even tho some TBC raid instances were gated with attunement, you pretty much always had something new to do while waiting for BT/ZA/Sunwell. Not to mention, that there was also way more Dungeons &amp; daily quests to do and actually awesome daily quests compared to the ones in Wrath and not in Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
Well it is at least better as what Wrath launched with, but one would think they would learn from their past mistakes. The content in Cataclysm right now is already stale.</div></div><hr />

All I can say is that I hope the fights in Firelands are brutally difficult, or I have a feeling a lot of people are going to get bored very quickly. Love the suggestions as to what to do when not raiding too: alts (there aren't enough bosses so do them multiple times ToC style), professions (yes very...fun?), PvP (lots of raiders, myself included, despise PvP) and achievements. This patch is beginning to sound like 3.2 all over again. Loads of new dailies guys, oh yeah and a really small instance that is supposed to tide you over until the next patch, but who cares about that, look at all the dailies.</div></div><hr />

Okay I'm lost here. I was only aware of the legendary staff:<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 4.2 introduces an epic quest that will challenge those daring enough to complete the legendary staff Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest. The great staff duplicates destructive magics, and also bestows upon its wielder the ability to transform into a member of the Blue Dragonflight.<br />
<br />
What other staff is there? Sorry I missed it completely. <br />
<br />
Apart from the legendary, is there another staff which transforms you into the fiery car form? Can you link to source please, I hate missing that kind of stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think anybody is faulting that Firelands only has 7 bosses. It is the fact that the entire raid tier only has 7 bosses that is disappointing people.<br />
<br />
As for SWP, it was filler content to tide people over until WotLK. The same as how Ruby Sanctum was added to give people something to do until Cata (even though I don't think many people cared to bother with Ruby Sanctum).</div></div><hr />

Also the atunments. You couldn't set your feet in TK/SSC unless you did the atunement (wich had to do with prior raids), the same for BT/Hyjal, even one boss in Karazhan had a atunement quest chain. We didn't get Black Temple a few months after TK/SSC. The TBC expansion by itself took a way lot more time to release unlike the Wotlk/Cataclysm too.<br />
<br />
ZA was designed as a T5 equivalent raid for 10man groups (since they felt like having a &quot;Karazhan like&quot; thing for T5/T6), not a T6. Only the timed event was designed for players alread in BT/Hyjal, but the overall raid was T5 level (with T5 level drops). So it could be looked at a let down since ppl were alread enjoying T5 and T6 content, but again, atunments and harder encounters hold most of the players at karazhan.<br />
<br />
From the 10 bosses in karazhan, you didn't actually had 10 &quot;WOWMGSOAWESOMEHARD&quot;, some were very stupid/easy (huntsman... and chess is a boss?). But since you had all those raids together and huge atunements holding you back, we aways forget about those loot pinatas (now called VoA/BH bosses).<br />
<br />
From Black Temple (with the &quot;should be&quot; last boss in the expansion), we had a huuuuuuuuge waiting until the next expansion. Wich we didn't had in WotLK even without taking into account the ICC wings opening one after another instead of all at once.<br />
<br />
And forget about comparing &quot;normal mode&quot; TBC raids with the current normal + heroic system. What happens is that what is labeled as &quot;heroic&quot; mode today would be most of the &quot;normal&quot; modes in TBC. What we had there was a mix of &quot;normal mode&quot; bosses for &quot;easy loot&quot; and &quot;heroic mode&quot; bosses in the same raid. TBC model applied on Cata raids, you would get something like Halfus on normal, than the next boss would alread be Valiona/Theralion Heroic (and you would NOT have the option to set to normal), followed by Council heroic and Cho'gall heroic. Magmaw and maybe Ominotron normal with the rest on heroic in BWD, both in heroic in Throne of the Four Winds (considering that we still had BH boss, if not, the 1st boss in TofTW would be normal mode). Most of the heroic modes with a little nerf here and there since you had no option other than fight them at &quot;heroic&quot;.<br />
<br />
So far, they're not doing bad with Cataclysm, altough I think ZA is a big let down. Used to tought that about ZG too, but after checking the instance, it's way better, they really did planned all along with ZG, but not with ZA (we don't even have a damn quest saying that ZA is back, unlike ZG! Unless I miss something in a text in one of the quests for ZG that mention something in ZA worth of going there to check the place for suspicious troll activity). ZG = &quot;re-used name/location&quot;, ZA = &quot;re-used instance&quot;. Worse for ZA that we have all the stuff that happened in Zul'drak about the ZA troll gods now free, that screws the ZA story for some bosses comeback.<br />

If you mean ganking, yes, it was in the game TOGETHER with the first ever dugeon or raid content.<br />
<br />
Structured PVP? Nope, for a long time, sorry. PVP was only a gank stuff.<br />

If we are comparing amount of content vs time between release then lets do that.<br />

TBC was the best bit of WOW in terms of content. No heroics in every feaking boss encounter - Still challenging - still orginal - and still ALOT of fantasic variety on bosses. Heroics are just lazy version of real new content. <br />
<br />
Its pathetic how little effort BLizzard is showing. Considering that half of the content is just buffed up versions - we should get double the amount of bosses realeased + extra instances. Thats not the case at all.<br />
<br />
49 boss encounters in matter of 13 months. - That was TBC</div></div><hr />

Please provide a source on the information regarding Blizzard wanting to move all subs from WoW over to Titan? I thought so.<br />
<br />
By what we know Titan is an MMOFPS or something along those lines, and is placed in a sci-fi universe. This is so far from Wow that it makes no sense trying to port their customerbase over to this IP. Try to consider this from a business perspective, it makes no sense at all. Why would they stop developing World of Warcraft when it makes up 89% of Blizzard's annual income? (Source (http://wow.joystiq.com/2011/04/22/the-lawbringer-lets-read-activision-blizzards-2010-10-k-annua)).<br />
<br />
Titan is a new IP, and maybe even a sort of new game genre. Draining WoW of its customers will not be its goal at all, your allegations are based on nonsense.<br />

<br />
There you go - Thats the future in terms of BLizzard. Not to improve WOW to make it competitive ... Just keep milking the 12 million subs and let their characters die slowly on a underdeveloped project -while the innovative work is done in another game.<br />
<br />
And there is a big thing between STOPING to develop things... instead of creating new and exiting things in an evolving MMO game. Thats what many of the long term WOW players are pointing out. The true CREATIVE development of WOW has stopped. ANd for a 12 million sub game - thats simply not acceptable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do not jump for joy just because Blizzard releases a new raid, or epics, or a legendary. If the raid sucks and the epics are all old models being recycled then I am much less impressed. Especially since by the time this raid is released it will be 6 months since the last new raid content was released. There has been plenty of time to develop boss encounters and new weapon models. In the past they have released great raid content on a shorter time frame. They even stated before Cataclysm was released that they wanted to return to the TBC model of raiding with smaller but more numerous raid instances. Blizzard has become lazy and cheap.</div></div><hr />

Or do you have sources inside Blizzard?. Think about it. Why would a multi million dollar company risk to offend their customer base by saving a buck and employing B class people? Save 1 million bucks by skimping on wages and firing people and lose 15 million bucks because a million subscribers quit? It might show how YOU would run a business, but after releasing awesome games for 15 years, my trust is in Blizzard. Plus: As everyone else, some game designers have a knack for fantasy, others for SciFi and others for Worldwar games - and it is the job of company leaders to employ them where they are best suited. Some might actually ASK to be placed on a different project that suits them better.<br />
<br />
Apart from that..I am looking forward to those dailies and 4.2, but first there is ZG and ZA to play.<br />
<br />
Who said Blizz if firing anyone? If you move developers to a different project, then I think they might be employed by the company still.<br />
<br />
<br />
He then bragged about the team working on the new MMO, saying that Blizzard created a &quot;dream team&quot; by tossing together their most experienced developers -- those that made World of Warcraft such a huge financial success. That said, Sams said that their byproduct will simply &quot;blow people's minds.&quot;<br />
<br />
tomshardware.com/news/World-of-Warcraft-MMORPG-dream-team-paul-sams-mike-morhaime,12337.html<br />
(can't post links yet, just put a www(dot) in front of that<br />
<br />
That's from Blizzard's COO Paul Sams. Not sure, but it does sound like they're moving their best developers over to Titan. The same people that brought us quality patches in the past are being pulled to the side for the next big thing. And what has already been posted, &quot;I know there are other things in the works and I think that is excelent. I think that team should go straight for World of Warcraft - trying to take every customer that World of Warcraft had, because if we don't then someone else will&quot;, they're set on making a possible replacement for WoW. Why would you not want to take your best developers from the game you're replacing and put them to work to create the quality of experience everyone had in WoW?</div></div><hr />

You don't like it when we take stuff away from you!? ;P<br />
<br />
So the actual issue was that there was a bug where emote /attacktarget for goblin and worgen played the sounds associated with both /roar and /attack at the same time, which sounded broken. Since no other race but goblin and worgen have roar sounds, the fix for the bug was to make them behave the same as all other races by removing the sounds.<br />
<br />
I know, I know, but it's done. OR IS IT!?<br />
<br />
Obviously people miss their roar sounds. What we're going to do is hook the goblin/worgen roar sounds back up in a 'future patch' (it's not hotfixable), hurray, and then attempt to record /roar sounds for all the other races to add to the game in a patch after that.<br />
<br />
Goblin/worgen, unfortunately lose their roars for a short while, but in the end everyone wins! Or at least roars. (Source)<br />
<br />
I don't quite know why anyone hasn't commented on this. &quot;A short while&quot;? Yeah, like that Dance Studio we were supposed to have at the start of Wotlk and are still waiting for since...Wotlk. Don't hold your breath folks, I suspect we won't be seeing any /roar's again for a long time.</div></div><hr />

All this whining about only 7 bosses, I didn´t see anyone mention that people would be getting 365 gear just from questing. 60 different quests? Nice. And choosing who you want to help first and what features you want to unlock first is epic.

I miss the days when servers accomplished things as a group. I.e AQ gates. However, with the amount of very low-pop realms atm, it's probably necessary.<br />
<br />
I believe they could probably adapt the requirements for low population realms.<br />
<br />
And yeah, I loved that aswell. :(</div></div><hr />

The Firelands raid is new, but the fact there are only one instance and 7 bosses is underwhelming to say the least. Maybe I was spoiled by TBC, but I was led by Blizz to believe Cata would be going back to that same amount of raid content again. This is half of that.<br />
<br />
because RAGNAROS IS EXACTLY THE SAME /sarcasm</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is sad is that they had this PR puff piece ready to go and were just waiting for someone to challenge them in the forums. Everything the CM's do now is a carefully calculated pre-generated response where whatever they decided to do now is the best way to go, instead of being honest and saying they are short on resources and that WoW is not a major priority for the company anymore.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">II Xion II</div><div class="date">2011-04-29, 11:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They said they wanted 2 raids per tier.<br />
They said they wanted to get out more content faster.<br />
<br />
And now we get a raid with 7 bosses? Just wtf. And their apologises for it only being 7 is hilarous.<br />
<br />
You must have A LOT of time and little respect for what goes into making a game. <br />
<br />
For people who work for a living, 12 bosses was an extremely annoying number not because it was hard but because it took forever and people have busy lives. Seven is just right.</div></div><hr />

I just renewed my sub and plan on playing casually with some friends, so I definetly won't be one of those every night players, but this entitlement mentality doesn't benefit anyone. If everything is accessible theres no goal, nothing to reach for. But I guess Blizzard gets their $15 whether or not players have any in game ambitions.</div></div><hr />

Is that true? I'm sure its still going to take a awhile to get, and cost a lot of those new marks being introduced. Still, something awesome for the solo player to go for.<br />
<br />
I might just resub for firelands.</div></div><hr />

After bringing out what they hope to be Sunwell 2.0? Are you really that clueless or do you just appear like it.<br />
<br />
The thing I enjoy the most is the people complaining &quot;only 7 bosses&quot; probably haven't even seen sinestra, so it wouldn't really matter if they only brought out 2 bosses, because you retards probably couldn't even down the first one. Quit complaining please.</div></div><hr />

Now where's my $20?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkfriend</div><div class="date">2011-06-28, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;Yeah, I mean that's a tough situation because our feeling is simply that people shouldn't be forced to play the game more than a couple nights a week to keep up on progression.&quot;One of the most stupid things a blue has ever posted. Its far better to have more content then you can access, then to beat everything and have nothing. No one is forcing you to play this game (unless you are a Chinese prisoner, if that story is true) and Blizzard saying that they want this tier to be easily beatable by casual players who don't raid as often (read it, thats what they say, in essence) is asinine. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO EVERYTHING BLIZZARD. If you suck, you don't get to final bosses. TBH, I'd rather kill 8/10 and never down 2 new bosses then have 7/7 on farm for months.Granted, we'll see how long it takes our guild to be on heroics. Yes, it is a bit of a pre-judgement. But unless 4.3 comes out sooner then 4-5 months down the road, I believe the above quote by Blizzard is asinine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, whens that darn winged guardian coming out??<br />
<br />
<br />
The Guardian is already out. And are you really that big of a tool that the mount will look less cool to you because everyone else who did the quest has it?<br />

Awesome, I can't wait for 4.2.<br />
@ dragonx: If you look at the history of WoW &amp; it's expansions, PvP don't get much content ALWAYS. New arena season is content for you since you are getting new shiny gear.<br />
IMO, PvP broke this game so badly (every cool ability in this game is often shot down &amp; nerf thanks to being OP in PvP but really cool in PvE) I don't really care about PvP content.<br />
<br />
And because I'm to fail to stop looking at my hot keys for 10 seconds I don't think anyone else should pvp either!</div></div><hr />
