Menus will be changed a bit, probably to merge Crafting and Items, don't worry if a category is missing. ^^</div></div><hr />

Back to topic:<br />
The rewards aren't that impressive, but quite good for a &quot;head&quot;-quest.<br />
Myself, playing a affliction warlock, I would like this +hit ring, because there are only a few good in the game yet.</div></div><hr />

Not very impressive though</div></div><hr />
