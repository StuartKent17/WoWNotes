Season 4 rating requirements increased ?<br />
The official armory has been full of surprises lately (See Today's news (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=6320.0) about the epic gems prices) and we heard about a few interesting potential changes to the 2.4 patch. <br />
<br />
This time, the news is much bigger, according to two season 4 items activated on the official armory, the personal rating requirements on shoulders has been increased to 2200. For the moment we don't know yet if it's a definitive change, or if the requirements on weapons have been increased as well. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This also means that we've got the stats of 2 additional season 4 items. Below are the stats gathered during the testing phase of the patch. <br />
<br />
Other item stats<br />
Very important note : Most of these items have &quot;outdated&quot; stats, the armor on the sets should be slightly higher. The only armor set up-to-date with the latest version of the PTR is the Paladin one. Keep in mind that all of them are from PTRs and could have been changed since then. <br />

Gamespy interview with Tom Chilton and Joong Kim about WoW Arena Tournament<br />
amespy posted a 7 pages long interview (http://uk.pc.gamespy.com/pc/world-of-warcraft/866456p1.html) with Tom Chilton and Joong Kim from Blizzard, you should definitely read it if you're interested in Arena balancing and things like that. Below are a few quotes from the interview<br />
[b]GameSpy: Have you looked internally at the distribution of players doing arenas on the live realm, separating those who are playing competitively with those selling teams or just tanking games to get gear?<br />
Tom Chilton: We don't really have any way of knowing that. We can't distinguish what the intent of a given player is, whether they consider themselves to be competitive or whether they're just doing it for the gear or whatever. Certainly as far as players who are trying to exploit the system through loopholes, we have some changes coming in a patch just a few weeks away where we'll close a lot of those loopholes. <br />
<br />
GameSpy: Are you able to talk about those changes yet?<br />
Tom Chilton: Not just yet. <br />
<br />
GameSpy: But we can expect the changes will be targeted at the point-selling teams.<br />
Tom Chilton: Point selling, personal rating selling. <br />
<br />
GameSpy: The two big things that players seem like they're against are the point-selling teams, since you can face highly skilled and geared players at even the low ratings, and those who bring alts or friends on a team to tank a team so that they can then get a high personal rating on the real team.<br />
Tom Chilton: Exactly, that's what we'll be addressing. <br />
<br />
A few lines about Death Knights<br />
GameSpy: I'm interested in something you just mentioned, the Death Knights. They've been described as the class that's going to be the two-hand Tank, the class that'll tank unlike any class before. But that's a PvE role, good luck tanking in arenas. What are they going to do in arenas?<br />
Tom Chilton: We definitely have to think about the Death Knight from all the different angles. We are starting to crystallize in our minds, how good the Death Knight tanks. What they're good at, what they're not good at. We have the core Death Knight mechanics already worked out. Their core spells and abilities. So they'll be filling their own tanking role. But in the same way, in the back of my mind as we design it, we have to figure out that they have their role in arena and have enough tools to be effective there too. <br />
<br />
And a last quote just for fun ...<br />
GameSpy: We can also expect that the group composition that wins overall will get nerfed shortly afterwards?<br />
Tom Chilton: (laughs) If it feels like that particular group composition dominated the tournament, then I would say yes, but not necessarily just the winners.<br />

Wrath of the Lich King News<br />
Most of the people reading this site aren't affected by this announcement I guess, but at least Blizzard is starting to communicate about WotLK. <br />
We're pleased to announce that our agreements with The9, our World of Warcraft partner in mainland China, and Soft-World, our World of Warcraft partner in the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, have been updated to include the localization, operation, and support of Wrath of the Lich King for players in their respective regions. Further news, including release plans for each region, will be announced closer to launch. <br />
<br />
Arena Tournament - Cure Poison not available to Tauren Druids<br />
It seems that someone forgot to add Cure Poison to the premade tauren druid's spell book, and Blizzard can't fix it anytime soon. <br />
We have bugged this, but as for when it will be fixed, we have no ETA. I wouldn't expect it to happen before the end of the First Qualification Round, not sure beyond that at this time either.<br />
<br />
<br />
Landro's Guards Changes<br />
The guards next to Landro Longshot (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=17249) have been changed to let people hostile with Booty Bay get their Trading Card Game rewards without being constantly attacked. <br />
The changes to guard spawns have been made. As I said before you will still have to deal with the guards but it should be easier now. I've found that if you stand behind Landro it should be possible to speak with him without too much difficulty.<br />
<br />
Being a Bloodsail Buccaneer is not meant to be easy. Dealing with the Booty Bay guards is the price you pay for the second coolest hat in the game (mine being the coolest).<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bytheriver</div><div class="date">2008-04-14, 03:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The shoulders is great since the stats aren't much better, but they look awesome. They show status and yet still maintain a fairly level playing field. <br />
<br />
Weapons however kinda sucks. I play between 1550-1750 in different brackets with a range of players from mostly S1 to mostly S3, but we fight S3 shouldered/weaponed teams at anything above 1550, very frequently when above 1600, and more often than not as you approach 1700. <br />
<br />
When you run a couple of melee classes, having S1/2 weapons and fighting players with S3 puts you at a disadvantage. Much more so than shoulders. <br />
<br />
All I can see this change meaning, is instead of the S3 shoulder+wep teams that steamroll at 1600 right now, we'll have S3 shouldered+S4 weaponed players steamrolling even more easily teams that still have S1/2 weapons, and with that disadvantage will never really stand much chance of getting S3 weapons to even things about a bit.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think they should look at having a weapon in your bags/on your toon auto-setting your personal rating to a certain value when you queue. If people want to boost friends from 1500, fine, but leave the S3/4 weapons in the bank and give people who've just managed to get a S1 weapon, a fair shot at beating you based on their skill, not by a massive DPS boost they don't stand a chance of getting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And hopefully with the other changes being implemented, S4 teams won't reap the monetary benefits that come along with something like that (aka selling teams).<br />
<br />
Ever since S3, this wreaked hell on the lower brackets if you didnt have an optimal setup or gear. Sadly I never found someone in equivallent gear so I never rose above 1800.<br />
<br />
I love the change idea, but makes me kinda iffy in hopes they do solve the win trading / selling / power leveling of teams.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't think it would be as wonderful as you think. By the time S3 ends it will have been possible for a 1500 rated player to have snagged all the pieces available that don't have a rating.<br />
<br />
If S4 starts and these types of players are effectively shut out of any future arena upgrades, they'll lose a big incentive to actually participate. <br />
<br />
All of a sudden the arena would become insanely more competitive, as people who played only for fun with a buddy in a less than ideal set-up, only doing 10 matches per week are removed from the system. Making the field that much smaller and relatively much harder to get the ratings needed for S4 pieces.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, most people fail to understand that in order for there to be a top there also needs to be a bottom.<br />
If for instance all the current -1850 teams stop playing the current 2k teams would be at ~1650, wich is why rating req on every arena piece wont ever happen.<br />
People need to have the feeling that they are working towards an reward, wether this feeling is realistic or not is a diffrent story but still, there is a goal.<br />
If there isnt a reward people would stop playing, wich would result in a drastic decrease in active teams and thus opponents to play against.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So because the game has casual players, nothing is supposed to exist that is focused toward those who are not? That is the same nonsense that has the raiders pissed off.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuig</div><div class="date">2008-04-14, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Arena used too be for the more casual players in WoW, and now they will make it even harder for the casual players there isnt much more left to do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would say that battlegrounds are for casual PvP. Arenas, by their very nature, are highly skill based and not casual friendly (at least at the competitive rungs of the ladder).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tuig</div><div class="date">2008-04-14, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">well if blizzard doesnt come up with anything else for casual players except those bullshit battlegrounds, then i think that WoW has peaked.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ajezz</div><div class="date">2008-04-14, 04:35 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My general point was that removing the incentive to participate for all the &lt; 1500 players would drastically reduce the size of the arena pool. <br />
<br />
This would make an S4 2200 rating more like a current 2400 rating, while at the same time making the S3 shoulders/weapon more difficult to obtain despite their new lower rating...<br />
<br />
Making things more difficult to obtain as time goes on has not been Blizzard's style to date, so I seriously doubt this drastic change in direction will begin with S4 (i.e. putting ratings on all S4 pieces).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny thing is, when they removed the rewards from raiding, the arena people told me to &quot;play for fun and not for loot&quot;. I give you guys this advice back now.</div></div><hr />

lol people aren't so stupid too play when they aint getting something, the fun of the game is achieving a certaint goal, or get sertant items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So... Why do you want all that nifty S4 Equip when you don´t have time to play anyway?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bytheriver</div><div class="date">2008-04-14, 05:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All these 2k+ rated people are always on about the skill, but whenever someone suggests they should have to beat people bellow 1850 using the same standard of gear, instead of higher DPS weapons such as now (and even more so in S4 if they are 2k) they scream about it.<br />
<br />
Instead, they all come down to 1650 and steam roll people with S1/2 and some S3 with much better gear.<br />
<br />
Just finished some games for today 1650-1700 rated, faced about 30% of teams with full S3 shoulders. Our healer has 2 parts of S3, and the rest is S1.. we don't stand a chance already and this will make it much worse.<br />

Should be about skill, not keeping players sub 1750 because the teams they face all have already got full S3 and they cant complete.</div></div><hr />

But you forgot something important. If I can not get S4 items why should I participate there? So now lets continous this, what if I am not the only one which will think like this.<br />
<br />
Arena is anyway so f$@&amp; unbalanced. <br />
<br />
What you think, if just the ub0r 100 Pro Arena teams left there, you think it will get better?<br />
Nobody will get a 2k+ rating with this constellation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ok. In your first post you said this is bullshit because people without time/SKILL can't get these items because they can't get the required rating. That's the reason for the requirement rating, to separate the people with time/SKILL from those that do not. Just like if you don't have the time/SKILL to get into BT/Hyjal, you're not going to go around with those pieces of armor.<br />
<br />
Plus, they're not putting requirements on all pieces so if you get enough arena points for those pieces of armor, it could increase your chances of getting a higher rating.<br />
<br />
If you're that worried about it, I would recommend leveling other toons. It's not that big of a deal to get the S4 stuff since LK is coming up around the corner.<br />
<br />
There's plenty of gold farming from the new dailies, get some gold and spend it.<br />
<br />
Start farming honor points/marks so you can get S2 gear for honor if you don't have it already.<br />
<br />
There's not a shortage of things to do, just think outside the box.<br />

lolol this is exactly what i ment lol, Both PvE and PvP is skill(pvp more then pve though)/time required, and my point was that there wasnt much left that casual players can achieve. you get money from daily's yes, and where to spend the gold on? getting yourself boosted in arena lol? thats just lame,and doing daily's isnt fun, so it becoming less and less a game for casual players. you seriously need to learn too read posts.</div></div><hr />

I supported the original idea to put rating requirements on weapons and shoulders, but if they really bump them up by another 200 pts or so without any concern of how that will affect the whole system is just plain dumb. If the reason for the increase is that too many ppl are running around with S3 weapons/shoulders despite the rating requirements, perhaps they should look at the rating distribution among the different brackets. In my battlegroup alone (Nightfall):<br />

Teams with rating over 1850 2000<br />

2v2 1610 522<br />
3v3 993 337<br />
5v5 324 118<br />

It's pretty clear where the inflation is coming from.... If they want to lower the number of ppl getting access to these items then they should apply different rating requirements for different brackets. Getting 2k on 5s is significantly harder then getting it on 3s, and even more so then 2s, not to even mention how horribly unbalanced 3s and 2s are. I'm sorry but I don't think that druid+anything face rolling their way to 2k in 2s is the same as taking a 5s team to top 100 in the battlegroup.<br />

So rating requirements = GOOD, equal rating requirements across all brackets = BAD.</div></div><hr />

l2p, get skill, get the new gear. It'll just take you a little longer to get to that point, no big deal. And if you don't get to that point, you got LK. And if you can't get higher ratings, it'll take you awhile to deck out in the s4 gear that you can get anyways, getting like ~300 points/week.<br />
<br />
And Blackburn has a good idea.<br />
<br />
I still recommend leveling toons to 70 in time for LK. This will help you have that 'feeling' of accomplishing something. Not to mention, you can go back and see things you forgot/never did.<br />

Even though I do no support raising the rating requirements even higher (at least not the way they probably plan on doing it), the &quot;no time&quot; argument just doesn't apply to arenas. We took our 5s team to 2k rating playing mostly only 10 games a week, so the time commitment we put in was no greater than some scrub team losing 10 games a week. So if you got the skills, arenas are the one place where lack of time will not be your enemy.<br />
<br />
However grinding the honor gear to supplement your arena gear is a different story....</div></div><hr />

<br />
2v2 should be only for points and fun, in this way, people cannot argue about &quot;that class is better then mine, he can roll face to shoulders&quot; when they actualy suck at game.<br />
<br />
And to whiners who posted above: even if they'll give you free full set enchanted and socketed with the best gems in the first day of the season, you'll still not be able to pass your line. You'll get steamrolled by top teams in s3 gear.<br />
<br />
So no, it's not the gear that makes difference, it's you. If you sucked 2 season in a raw, and stayed on 1800 rating, if they;ll give you the best gear in game, you'll not better, becouse it's not the gear, it's the arena expirience, team playing, and dedication.<br />
<br />
for example, there are good hunters holding high spots, and doing great. And they don't think that their class suck and the pilars should be removed, and they are like few.<br />
<br />
<br />
And there are loads of casuals, thousands who think that hunter is underpowered, and pilars should be removed, and it should be a dps race fest.</div></div><hr />

Until Blizzard can provide balanced content instead of what these stats show then any kinda raiting to limit players progress is not acceptable<br />
<br />
MMOs are build on the basic rules of equal chance of progress for every character - WOW PVP is as far from that as any game can ever get.</div></div><hr />

Even raiders have full s3, maybe some1 runing around w/o shoulders, becouse he recently dingined level 70, and it's an alt.<br />

You know what personal raiting stands for ? Ask the % of hunters. Then tell everyone they have equal chance of progressing. <br />
<br />
WOW PVP arena system shows that current devs are totally incompitent of creating balanced content. 10 million ppl will be finding that out in the next year. Incoming 1000% more ppl rolling druids and warriors compared to hunters and Mages. And that wont affect PVE content ? <br />

I'm pretty willing to bet that half the people whining about this can't even make 2k so they change won't affect you anyway because you never could get the shoulders. And more so you can still get all the other 4 pieces of the set but you can't get the shoulders because simply you're not good enough and the stat increase is so small it won't make a difference anyway.<br />
<br />
All this casual talk is very idiotic. Do you people really expect to get the same gear and treatment while you're playing LESS than the people who devote much more time into their character? No, it doesn't work like that. Sorry. <br />
<br />
Burning Crusade has been as casual and as scrub friendly as possible with all the epics flowing around. The shoulders are merely a visual sign that shows that the specific player has performed exceptionally in arena. I don't even want to remember S1 and S2 where everyone was running around with the shoulders thinking they're the shit.</div></div><hr />

This is the real problem..... Everyone is talking about people whining because they don't have enough &quot;skill&quot;. I'm a Ret Pally and I love to play my spec. I've put in the time and I've gotten almost every peice of gear I am able to with a top rating of 1650ish... that' means mostly s3 with some season 2 gear<br />
<br />
Will I ever get to 2200 or even 1800 with my current setup... No<br />
<br />
Is is because I don't have enough skill.... No<br />
<br />
It's because a Ret Pally is an unbalanced class in 2v2, and unless I dump my partner of 6 months for a well geared Resto Druid (assuming I can even find one, since everyone wants one) I'm probably stuck with a s2 weapon untill they drop rating requirements. <br />
<br />
Do you think every single hunter out there sucks? If you do you should look at the BG scores at the end of the match, hunters are often the top of DPS but they're just about the worst class in 2v2.... not because they dont' have &quot;skills&quot; but because their class isn't suited to 2v2 combat.<br />
<br />
Sure, some people lack armor, lack playing skill, lack cooperation in an arena team.... but there's probably more people out there that just rolled a character who isn't good for arena competition.<br />
<br />

Mostly true, but you also wouldn't be punishing the new guy who just started playing WoW 2 months ago and finds he has no chance of competing against anybody when he steps in the arena. WoW players aren't in a union, and tenure shouldn't give a person an automatic advantage in an instanced PvP environment.</div></div><hr />

Actually, yes it is because you don't have enough skill.

<br />
<br />
If you are casual, what else do you need gear for other than 5/10 mans and dailys?<br />
<br />
Leave the exceptional gear to the people that will actually use/earn it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daedalon</div><div class="date">2008-04-14, 09:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Now let me tell you what I think of current Arena system.<br />
<br />
Its simply the worst MMORPG ruleset that has EVER been created.<br />
<br />
It is build around allowing FEW classes to dominate part of an entire game. It is a system that trives on unbalance. Its ok to have unbalanced classes ingame but then u DONT make a ruleset that INCREASES that unbalance. Its very easy to create a perfect ruleset where EVERYONE starts at same spot after each season. That is not the case atm. Players that have been benefitting the past year of TBC from unbalanced PVP arena content will continue to do so for the next 6 months creating more and more unbalance MMORPG game. <br />
<br />
How many of the current players that are here talking about skills realise that at this point in time, it takes same basic skills of a DPS warrior and healing druid to get to 2000 raiting as it takes a hunter and healing shaman to get to 1650 raiting. THAT is the skills we are talking about in this game. And THAT is the skills that players here are so proud of. Its a joke. I have my own ideas how to build a fair ruleset for current arena. And belive me - that system is NOT build around giving out stats items to increase the diffrence between classes. Its so easy to prevent that. But the current &quot;geniouses&quot; at Blizzard (or should we say castouts from EQ and UO) couldn't care less. &quot;The game is not supposed to be balanced&quot;.... Oh really...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tetravuss</div><div class="date">2008-04-14, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mostly true, but you also wouldn't be punishing the new guy who just started playing WoW 2 months ago and finds he has no chance of competing against anybody when he steps in the arena. WoW players aren't in a union, and tenure shouldn't give a person an automatic advantage in an instanced PvP environment.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is what happened to me. Got to 70 waited awhile to start arena (started like 2 months ago, 3v3 mostly). I keep hovering around 1550-1600. Now I'm saving points for S4 and hoping that I can at least go 200 or 300 higher rating. I'm not bitching. I'm setting myself up for the next season while taking this one in stride.<br />
<br />
For all the talk about 'welfare' epics, it still takes time getting the gear that you need just like it takes time getting the gear from raiding.<br />
<br />
People need to QQ and realize the time they put in directly effects what they will get out (some exception to arena as blackburn has pointed out). Have fun, do what you can. If you can get that rating, thats awesome. If not, experiment a little, get some better gear, because I'm sure most people that complain are not geared up like the people they are hitting - that's certainly my problem. But when s4 comes out I'm looking at getting 3 s4 pieces and getting supplemental s2 honor gear until I can get enough arena points for the rest of s4. Then I'll be g2g.<br />
<br />
point is - have fun. 2200 is attainable - the harder it is to get, the more rewarding it will be. I know when I equip my s4 weapon/shoulders (if it happens) I'll be happy as hell.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So you still want the best items in the game, when you are terrible at this game and cant earn them? If you dont have the time to earn easy pvp epics, you dont have the time to earn the pve epics. Guess what, WoW is an MMO...in MMOs the people that spend the most time in the game generally have the best 'stuff'.<br />

You dont get it do you ? You can still be terrible at this game and get full set IF you roll the right classes and specs.<br />
<br />
Do the calculations and see how a DPS warrior needs the same &quot;skill&quot; to get to 2200 as it takes a hunter to get to 1850. NO matter if hes doing 2v2 3v3 or 5v5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
First of all, &quot;her&quot;? Have you even killed Illidan?<br />
Second, Illidan drops the full set of Tier6? You can't get a single piece of it until you can kill him?<br />
Third, there are 71 2v2 teams, 33 3v3 and 24 5v5 teams above 2200 rating in my battlegroup. That's only 361 ppl in the entire battlegroup that have that rating. I bet there is a lot more ppl farming Illidan and even getting Sunwell loot already. Hell, my server alone has probably half that number farming Illidan.</div></div><hr />

An impossibility for them to play players that just started with their teams or even ppl that dont have gear. This would help players that are not well geared and be accessable to some sort of gear that they may grab instead of just getting 1k arena points a month. That would lead to more competion and more players that would enjoy the arenas. My team being at 1661 from 1795 after a 8-10 losing streak, we managed to play atleast 2 players on each team that were full S3 geared, while us in S3/S1. Now having the personal rating req for gear increased and possibly on all gear will make it impossible for players to even get to 1700+to be able to purchase their gear. Also limiting well geared players to jump on and switch teams to help increase the rating for gear for possibly shittier skilled or geared players for the cost of gold.</div></div><hr />

The little problem here is that if you kill illy only 2-3 people of your 25 people raid get shinies. Basically, 10% per kill. Under perfect circumstances, aka no bad luck with the random number generator.<br />
<br />
If you get to 2200 rating your entire group gets a full set. No problem with random chance, no farming him for 10-20 weeks after you killed him the first time.<br />
<br />
(Yes, yes, it costs arena points, of cource. But those are plentyful, especially at that rating. If you would get a new kind of arena points at that rating which you needed for the s4 items and where you could only buy 1 item a week then you might have a point, however....)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most important part tho. U need 25 ppl to take illidan down - meaning balance between classes and specs.<br />
<br />
It takes two ppl to get 2200 raiting. And it thrives on unbalanced gameplay. <br />
<br />
Can noone see where this is leading in a MMO game ?</div></div><hr />

News flash, it takes 10-20 weeks (often more) to get 2200 rating and get FIVE ppl 1 piece of gear, and then that's it, there is no bringing other ppl on to get them equivalent loot too. If you're farming Illidan, EVERY week THREE ppl get 1 piece of Tier6 and 2-3 other ppl get other Tier6 quality loot. 1 Tier6 boss equips 5 ppl in S3 quality gear every week. I both arena and raid, the only raiders that QQ about arenas are the ones that suck at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know what farms warrior/druid and warlock/druid? HUNTER/Druid. <br />
<br />
Ret paladins are good, but not in 2v2. Also, if you can't get past the 1600s in 2s with your ret paladin and any partner wearing full s2/s3, then you are awful and don't deserve the weapon. 1500s is propagated by newbs and scrubs that play 10 a week, but have lots of resilience. 1600s is full of bad cookie cutter teams that need to l2play. So whatever made you think that you deserve a s3 weapon and/or shoulders for being terrible, lol!<br />

<br />
Well interesting idea.<br />
<br />
I say implement it ASAP. That way 95% of the playerbase will instantly know they have zero chance of ever getting gear and will give up Arena. The reamining 500 on each b/grp will suddenly find that as the competition is so tough they will lose often enough never to get a good ranking. <br />
<br />
Whatever the result that would be the best thing to ever happen to PvP</div></div><hr />

People that only arena don't have access to PvE gear. And comparing the two is stupid since it's totally not the same gameplay/challenge/fun. If you only see the loot out of it, shame on you.<br />
<br />
If you can't realise that someone that plays a lot has access to better gear then someone who is cusual, you shouldn't even be posting here since you're a re...<br />
<br />
Also, before saying that you won't be able to get to 2k because people will outgear you, look at the gear difference. It's not like you're in blue and they are in overpower purple. The gap between s2 and s3 is not enough to make it an excuse. Also, only 2 pieces right now have a personal rating which makes it even smaller.<br />
<br />
And to anyone who says that they can't get to high rating because of their class, it's not. You're probably bad in arena. Yeah you're going to tell me look at the numbers of war/druid in 2s and priest/mage/rogue in 3s and elem shammy teams in 5s... It's true but my point is, any class can be good u just need to find what suits your class and your PLAYSTYLE. <br />
<br />
I'm a rogue who played with a disc priest for about 2 months, we got to 1750 in 2 hours and were stuck from 1750 to 1830 for 2 months, so we got tired of it and stopped. It is suppose to be one of the easiest setup in 2s but I sucked at it. I then invited a rogue to try the 2 rogues team. After about 15 games to get used to the playstyle, we got to 1850 easily and we barely play 15 games a week.<br />
<br />
I don't consider myself an hardcore pvper in arena and I totally agree with the fact that people who play a lot more arenas than me should have access to better gear. Put rating on every single piece of S4 IMO. Starting at 1650 for gloves and +50 per item... If you can't do good in arena whatever your class/setup/spec is why should you have gear that was implemented in the game for PVPERs...</div></div><hr />

<br />
2200 is to much this only supports the imba combos in 2v2 such as Wl/druid ....<br />
<br />
so you can see all of your Druids/Warriors and Warlocks with s4 Shoulders due the imbalance in 2v2</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bumping up the weapons to 1950-2000 isn't an awful idea either.<br />
<br />
Putting rating req on all of the S4 gear would remove the arena system from active gameplay and that's what I support most out of what people here have said. The Arena system will go the way of lvl 60 raids and fade into the night if they make it impossible for the lower rankings to get gear of decent value. <br />
<br />
No matter how much argument of skill you want to lay down in the brackets the overall problem remains that there won't be a high end bracket system period if they add rating to all items. To be at the top there needs to be someone to beat. And if the only people playing are the high end competative teams I want to see how high a rating they will get when everyone has a nearly even win/loss record.<br />
<br />
As a retribution paladin I will strive in Season 4 to get myself a new weapon. Because even in raiding it eclipses for my class atleast everything else on the board. Will it be easy? No. Will I repeatedly get steamrolled by the cookie cutter druid/melee team? Yes. Will I get frustrated at imbalance? Yes. But I'll still play because, well..... I'm pretty damn good at what I do.<br />
<br />
Sadly not everyone can say that and if they add rating to every item I'll be forced to stop Arena play merely because it's a waste of time and money. Due to class restrictions I'll get stuck at the low end brackets in 2v2 and 3v3 where it's easiest to attain higher rankings. And so will everyone else that's on the &quot;unpopular class&quot; list that the wonderful little diagram on the news page points out. If you want to talk about skill anymore take a second to log out and look at the class/rating breakdown and tell me what in that analysis screams skill.<br />

Simply because the one reason is in a 2v2 or 3v3 you can knock down the rating to almost 1.2k. Then add your main and friend and your personal rating will hit 2k befor the team even makes it back to 1.5k. Thats why it wont chanage people do it now and will do it again with s4 theres always loop holes around pvp. Thats why people still afk/bot in av.</div></div><hr />

2. Stop complaining about class imbalance, while it might be easier for some classes to get the rating, it's still achievable by all classes so stop acting like it's mission impossible for class X or Y.<br />
3. People complaining that they have the right class or spec but not the right partner are stupid also. You think you can kill raid bosses with retarded raid setups or improperly specced people? No.<br />
4. S4 is the last season, these shoulders will be the BEST shoulders for PVP until WotLK, they better be hard to get don't you think?<br />
5. That arena gear has ended up as welfare epix for 3 seasons now and caters (bad) casuals with top end gear probably wasn't intended in the first place. <br />
6. You don't need the best of the best gear if you play as 'casual' (in case of PVP, there is no such thing as hardcore or casual, so people saying they are casual are just afraid to admit that they suck), since the best of the best gear is only required for parts of the game you'll never see. <br />

Know what I did? I got my S3 shoulders on my druid first. That didn't take long. Then I went on my rogue, and got the shoulders in twos with him. Then I went on my mage and got the shoulders in twos on her. Sure, 3s would have been easier for the rogue and mage, but wtf do I care I don't button mash and cry &quot;UNBALANCED&quot; when it takes me more than a month. Did I ever say that druids aren't unbalanced in twos? Hell no, because they are. But they also blow serious chode in fives compared to shamans, priests, paladins, warlocks, warriors, and mages. The only class which blows more chode than druids in fives in fact, is the rogue. <br />

I promise you, there are alot of teams that can't get 2200 rating, not because they aren't skilled, but because when they play they might only meet their antisetups etc. And before you come and tell me to l2p cause Im stuck at 2k rating or w/e you wanna say to me, I played 5v5 and 3v3 in s2 up to ~2350 rating in both the brackets. And I can honestly say, atleast for 3v3, that the teams we met at 2200-2300rating, usually weren't any different, then the teams we met at 1900-2000rating. I could agree though, that there is a wall, if you compare the top 20teams in 3v3, and top 10 teams in 5v5, to the 2k-2,3k rated ppl in those brackets.<br />
<br />
To make this post abit shorter, all I wanted to say is, personal rating is quite rubbish imo, cause lets be honest, the biggest reason why some teams gets higher ratings then others is because they get lucky and meet lots of easy setups to beat.</div></div><hr />

So after &quot;10-20&quot; weeks you have only enough arena points to buy &quot;1 piece of gear&quot;?<br />
<br />
Rrrrrrrrrright.<br />
<br />
And you seem to forget that you do not just run into BT and kill illidan. You have to farm kara, farm SSC/TK and finally progress through BT/MH. That takes a good deal longer than &quot;10-20 weeks&quot;.<br />
<br />

Unless you want to suggest to introduce a limit so people can only buy one arena epic per week? Now THAT would make things interesting.<br />

Which reminds me of something:<br />
There might be only xxx teams of arena rating of 2200+, but you are blissfully ignoring a little fact: you only need that rating to *buy* the items, not to *use* them. <br />
Your numbers would only be valid if you had to stay at that rating. But you don't. YOu can reach that rating, buy the items, and fall back to a less stressful 2000 one or even lower.</div></div><hr />

Rrrrrrrrrright.<br />
<br />
And you seem to forget that you do not just run into BT and kill illidan. You have to farm kara, farm SSC/TK and finally progress through BT/MH. That takes a good deal longer than &quot;10-20 weeks&quot;.<br />

Mate it looks that you are doing all activity in wow ONLY for items. Wow is about FUN and something for relax :) and Items are just REWARDS ;D So try to look on it this way ;) If it is problem fo you to get items from PvE try to do PvP if from PvP then try to do more PvE ... but dont forget --&gt; HAVE FUN &lt;-- ! :-*</div></div><hr />

In WoW they give the best players even more advantage so both the best players and the poor players loose interest (atleast us looking for an exiting, fair fight). I love having my full S3 pawning the most players but sometimes the gap becomes boring where I would like another option. I see the tricky part in creating an environment like that, but still often many things abot competing feels like reverse logic.</div></div><hr />

Illidan won't drop her bow for me if I can't actually kill her, whats different?<br />
<br />
In PvE Illidan doesn't get harder for me to kill after you've killed him.<br />
In PvP Illidan get harder for me to kill after you've killed him.<br />
<br />
This is because in PvP I am competing against you, in PvE I am competing with you.<br />
<br />
The difference is really in that, if my competition has better gear than me, it's going to be harder for me to beat that competition than it was for my competition to get that gear in the first place.<br />
<br />
Also, the fact that PvP gear work so well in PvE and Blizzard's decision to water-down PvE rewards...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zeroevil</div><div class="date">2008-04-15, 12:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish blizzard would just fix the personal ratings issue that is currently plaguing the system. I mean i've recently started a 2v2 (2x Hemo Rogue) team sure I know it's not the best group match up, but here's the thing it doesn't seem to matter regardless when we saw within the first two weeks 9 matchs with teams with full s3 gear. This can be very disheartening especially after dropping gold to make a team to be against somewhat evenly matched teams. I'm in 3/5 s1 with s1 weapons and s3 offset gear, my partner which hasn't been in the arena since s2 started has a great deal of s2/s2 offset. We both started with 1500 individual rating and our first three matchs were against 3 teams that had personal ratings of 1750+ how can this be fun at all. Another question how can this be legit if in fact the arena system did work properly. We've recorded every match and recorded their ratings along with ours hell we've even joined the server to bs with them after a close match.<br />
<br />
I have no issues with 2k weap/2.2k shoulder rating I think it's a privilege to be able to get those items and they should be earned not just afked for like the current bg'ing system. My honest opinion is regardless if you quit a team you should keep your highest personal rating and it should be applied to any new team. That way if you go out and make a new team you have to fight against ppl evenly matched by ratings, I would have no issues doing 2k rating if I had gotten there once in that season.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For me, there is no problems to have rating on items.<br />
Everyone knows how hard it is to rise a good arena rating (without PL), so those who achieve that, diserve a &quot;special reward&quot;<br />
<br />
But maybe blizard could split and limit matchs according to the rating. Matching between slices of rating like : 1400 to 1850 then 1850 to 2000 and finnaly 2k+<br />
<br />
A team witch has rised 1850, and which have acces to new arms, cannot fall with team under 1850 which is still fighting in S1/S2.<br />
<br />
This just to try to get the same level of equality, like teams surrounding 2200, which all have the same gear and where, just, the skill makes the difference.<br />
<br />
Need a bit more fairlyness / Equality, just to rise because a team has some skills rather than rise because it's overstuff.<br />
<br />
And also find a way, to stop the Power levelling in arena, just to avoid to have full S3 in 1450 teams ( just for exemple: require personnal rating 2000, cannot be use in 2000 minus team rating or something like that :p )<br />
<br />
Probably impossible to realise, i aggree.<br />

Why do you think you see all those full s3 teams at low rating? Cuz they are selling arena pts... How to fix it? So easy. Instead of taking the team rating to give the points every tuesday, do it separatly for every player in the team. Take their lower rating (team or PR) and give them pts.<br />
<br />
Let's say a full s3 war/druid start a 2s team to sell it. They bring it up to 2k and sell it to scrubs in green. They play 3 or 10 games (depending on how they selling pts) and will probably lose all of them and their personnal rating will be like 1480 or something like that. Now on tuesday, the 2 people that bought pts should receive pts for their shitty 1480 personnal rating. That would end ALL the full s3 teams in the 1500-1700 brackets.<br />
<br />
I know someone already suggested to give the entire team the pts for the lowest rating in the team but I think that would be too much. Let's say my arena partner stop playing (our team is at 1.9k) and i have to replace him. Why should I do less pts for a few weeks...<br />
<br />
AND stop comparing how easier it is to get arena gear vs pve gear, it's totally not the same game... If you're a raider who complains that arena gear is easier to get then GO ARENA AND STOP SPAMMING 222232222322223...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
For 5v5 bracket, for each new person that joins the team, the team looses 100 arena rating. <br />
For 5v5 bracket, your personal rating can not go 150-200pts higher than the team rating.<br />
The points you gain each week are based off your personal rating now?<br />
<br />
Those scale respectively for the other 2 brackets (like losing 200 pts per person on a 2v2). <br />
<br />
Wasn't that posted somewhere as the intended change being pushed through to stop point selling?</div></div><hr />

don't forget it takes tons of skill for a hunter to pair with a druid to hit 2k+ or a mage to pair with a rogue and hit 2k+ either. learn to play class combinations that work and quit crying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all started in s1 gear, than upgraded to s2 etc. So you might just need to pay arena points for season 3 gear before you get you greedy hands on season 4 instandly.<br />
<br />
I don't think this rating change is gonne change much either, skill wise everything simply moves up, what 2k is atm will be 2.2k in season 4 etc.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents.</div></div><hr />

Don't you just think that the most teams you strugle with atm will be on a higher rating aswell? Couse i think that everythnig simply moves up a notch (rating wise) and this change only results into everyone getting more arena points.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FailedCRC</div><div class="date">2008-04-16, 09:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They really need to make the rating requirements differ per bracket.<br />
<br />
Getting 2200 on a normal battlegroup in 2v2 with a strong combo is doable.<br />
<br />
Doing so in 5v5 is very different, where the top rated teams are often 300-400 points short of the top 2v2 rated teams.<br />
<br />
Better still they would evaluate the actual distribution of teams and ratings in each bracket on each Battlegroup and have the rating be the top X%, changing dynamically and recalculated every day (with a minimum lower bound so the formula didn't break on a season restart obviously).</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is not the case at all, and you do not seem to understand how the rating system works. this would only be the case if newly created teams would get a team rating of 1700 instead of 1500. as this is not how it is, we will have exactly the same situation that we have now, and simplified, it means that the amount of teams that can be at high ratings is dependent on the total amount of teams playing in a specific bracket in that battlegroup. for every rating point gained by a team, another team has to loose the same amount of points. the direct effect of raising the rating requirements is that fewer people will have access to the items, which seems to be what Blizzard is intending.</div></div><hr />
