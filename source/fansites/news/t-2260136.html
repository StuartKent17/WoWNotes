Russell Brower (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Russell_Brower) was the senior director of audio and lead composer of Blizzard Entertainment.<br />
To anyone familiar with my work at #Blizzard,<br />
<br />
It’s with a heavy heart that I post this status update, but as they say, “all good things…”<br />
<br />
I’m extremely proud of the amazingly talented team I helped build and the creative output we’ve accomplished together over these past 12 years. As the company has grown, the topography of the Sound team has adjusted accordingly, and the last couple of years have been no exception. With the success of a “sound de-centralization” initiative, my current position of overall Sr. Audio Director/Composer is no longer relevant and is being eliminated.<br />
<br />
Today is my last day, though there is an excellent chance I will continue to contribute to Blizzard’s projects as a freelance composer. Obviously, I have a lot to figure out, so I do not have any further information to share as to what I will be doing next….yet. (Except for my solo album— that is well under way; stay tuned!)<br />
<br />
I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to EVERYONE reading this: all of our Players, Music Lovers, and the countless new friends I’ve made worldwide, for the incredible and indelible life experiences I have enjoyed while at Blizzard. Especially the Players— each of you have truly enriched our lives by playing our games, meeting us at #BlizzCon and #Nerdtacular, attending our music concerts the world over, enjoying our soundtrack albums and sheet music— the list goes on and on. We have so much to be proud of and I am truly grateful to each of you and to all my Blizzard colleagues for putting up with me over the last 12 years and teaching me so much.<br />
<br />
I look forward to staying in touch with ALL of you, be it here on FaceBook, Twitter (handle-change coming up), and at future concerts (actually I have several #VGL shows still to come this year in Europe, China and Brazil.)<br />
<br />
WATCH THIS SPACE for news of my solo album, the first track of which I just recorded in June with 51 of the FINEST studio musicians in Los Angeles!!! #AFM #Local47 FTW!<br />
<br />
Wishing each of you all my best, with tons of gratitude,<br />
<br />
Russell Brower<br />

I really hope someone with compltely fresh approach will work on music for 8.0 onwards.</div></div><hr />

There should not be .<br />
<br />
<br />
With the success of a “sound de-centralization” initiative, my current position of overall Sr. Audio Director/Composer is no longer relevant and is being eliminated.<br />
<br />
Looks to me he got fired. Most likely due to with reorganizations / rebuilding the sound design team and he didn't really fit / wanted any other spot that most likely would be a downgrade for him.</div></div><hr />

I wish him all the best. The music he contributed to WoW will be around and loved for all time. It really makes the game enjoyable and adds to the atmosphere and feeling of it all. Of course he had a great team to help him but he composed some great work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wait. He was 'made redundant'? Blizzard got rid of the guy responsible for some of their most iconic music because of MONEY? Jesus Christ this game is going down hill. Fast. They're milking it for the last few drops they can get and then they'll toss it aside.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Without having done any research, I assume &quot;sound decentralization&quot; means that Blizzard will from now on hire external composers instead of having their own ones. Maybe its for the better, Diablo 3's and SC2 soundtracks left a lot to be desired and WoW's newer soundtracks - while still decent - got more repetitive after Wotlk, which probably is unavoidable if the same people stay in charge of the soundtracks, at some point they run out of fresh ideas.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DarkAmbient</div><div class="date">2017-07-21, 09:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You have to wonder what the hell is going on at Blizzard when someone like Russell Brower is made redundant. Seriously, what the actual fuck?<br />
<br />
That said, perhaps the suits are worried about sliding sub numbers and feel like a shake-up of the old guard is necessary to bring some new life into the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just delusional thinking. Everyone who left blizzard lately have been with them for more than 10 years. Which is more than enough time to get sick of the place. Overall, Blizzard is a cool company to work at and I can't imagine people wanting to leave there because &quot;their games are shit&quot; because let's be honest. Blizzard is one of the best gaming companies there is.</div></div><hr />

As for the reasons we can always point the finger at Blizzard being the naughty one, people can take redundancy as the only option and &quot;no choices&quot; left because they don't want to accept the new types of contract being offered, so it is difficult to say wholly whose the real instigator. <br />

I can't imagine the corporate dynamics that would make Rusell Brower's role &quot;redundant&quot;. I've seen him live on Blizzard concert, he is passionate about his music and it shows. I hope he will continue to write for Warcraft, but either way the magic of his music will endure and wherever he goes next he will always find the love of the people he inspires.</div></div><hr />

Don't get me wrong, he is great artist responsible for one of most iconic aspects of wow. Its just that after WoTLK, his work on wow became very...repetitive ? MoP had few good tracks, but both WoD and Legion really felt like more of we already have.<br />
<br />
I really hope someone with compltely fresh approach will work on music for 8.0 onwards.<br />
<br />
I think MoP had a different vibe, mainly because most tracks were (for the most part) directed by Jeremy Soule, or in other words the guy who did the Skyrim Soundtrack (hopefully just among other things, it's the only 2 things I know him for).</div></div><hr />

So? Most people have no clue about most topics on this earth. And still people talk about them and exchange opinions. Negativity and rejection ire just part of the game called life, don't take them too serious. Especially video games and media overall attracts millions of narrow minded people who express theirselves.

Neal doesn't work at Blizzard, he is an independent composer. So Blizzard can't fire him like Russell, but it's also not sure either they'll keep commissioning music from him.</div></div><hr />

I personally liked a lot of the soundtrack in Warlords. Speficially Gorgrond/Everbloom, Frostfire Ridge, Spires of Arak, Skyreach, Auchindoun, Talador and Nagrand.<br />

<br />
Personal opinion though is that WoW's music the last couple of years has been bland, they've tried too hard to make everything sound epic with orchestras there's a lack of ambient music, the Witcher 3's soundtrack is how it should be, a mix of both but Russell always used orchestras.</div></div><hr />

Without having done any research, I assume &quot;sound decentralization&quot; means that Blizzard will from now on hire external composers instead of having their own ones. Maybe its for the better, Diablo 3's and SC2 soundtracks left a lot to be desired and WoW's newer soundtracks - while still decent - got more repetitive after Wotlk, which probably is unavoidable if the same people stay in charge of the soundtracks, at some point they run out of fresh ideas.<br />
<br />
Or maybe they got redundant because WoW started moving towards &quot;sound decentralization&quot;<br />

Yeah I always liked WoW music but to be honest I'm playing the game way too much to have music on all the time. I play a couple days at the start of a new expansion with music on but after that turn if off.<br />

For me, music in a game is very important, and the music in WoW has been awesome all the way, and a BIG thanks to Russell Brower for making such excellent music experience in the game. <br />

Not that I think the music and sound in the game will be worse in the future, but Brower is awesome!</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, you're not &quot;someone who wants to love WoW&quot;, you don't even bother looking at earnings calls to form an informed opinion. If you did, you'd see that WoW pulled 800 million USD on a bad year (end of WoD), and is now around the 1 billion USD mark before Legion is even in its final patch. If that's a dying game in your little mind, then that's all the proof one needs of what sort of ilk you belong with. <br />
<br />
Pathetic.<br />
<br />
I'm an actual fan of this game, and I'll voice concerns and give feedback rather than just sit around acting like a toddler with a speech impediment uttering the same nonsensical phrase over and over in the form of; &quot;WoW is dying!&quot;. A phrase which hasn't come to fruition in the 12+ years that idiots have been throwing it around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vanilla was mostly Jason Hayes. Brower only joined Blizzard in TBC, and even that was mostly Matt Uelmen (though the Blood Elf zones where his).<br />
<br />
WOTLK was when he really came into the forefront.<br />
<br />
Not to diminish his input, he crafted some great pieces of music, but Jason Hayes is, for me, the definitive WoW composer, and I'm really glad he returned to Blizzard a couple of years ago.<br />
<br />
I also think that Starcraft 2 and Diablo 3 (sans Reaper of Souls) had a disapointing musical direction under his watch.<br />
<br />

Who cares if you doubt it? You can doubt all you like, the facts are in their earnings calls, which are free for everyone to examine. And no, the store mounts are not the only revenue they have outside of subs in regards to this game.<br />

Just how can be the game be &quot;most profitable ever&quot; if the team is bigger than ever and the subs are way below half of its biggest ever number? That plainly is more expenses and less income than when it was in the peak, so where does the money come from?</div></div><hr />

<br />
From subs, services, physical items, WoW tokens (whom can now be bought for ingame gold and converted to Battle.net Balance, not just sub time), box sales.<br />
<br />
Earnings calls are public (and highly illegal to forge), curious minds can simply examine them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not true for huge projects like WoW. Most of modern day WoW soundtrack is performed and recorded live and only bolstered with high quality sample library mockup parts and synths. Low and mid budget projects rely on highly skilled people who are able to mock up pieces with sample libraries that sound fairly convincing to the layman's ears, but big budget productions - with good reason - still use real orchestras and performers in the final production.<br />
<br />
Either way, this has no bearing on needing - or not needing - a guy like Brower. You can have the best commercially available, or custom-produced virtual instruments on earth - they're just high-quality sounds, they won't compose any music for you. Further, Brower wasn't &quot;just&quot; the composer - he was actually the lead of all things audio at Blizzard. Like an art director in the music department. He was largely responsible for the artistic direction, cohesion, quality insurance and overall organisation of all audio contributors and assets. <br />
<br />
Giving up in-house art teams and leads is generally much more cost-effective, but product quality and identity almost always take a huge blow as a consequence, so I'm not sure if this was wise of Blizzard. They always had absolutely exceptional audio, probably the very best in the industry. Another company who employs inhouse audio in many of their studios - and it really shows - is Ubisoft. Not exactly encouraging to see a company like Blizzard apparently cutting corners here.</div></div><hr />

Subs are less than half of their peak, which also correlates to box sales: way less than on the peak.<br />

<br />
&quot;The one thing that always stayed good about WoW&quot; =/= People having different opinions on what constitutes good music. Plenty of WoW music has been deemed rubbish depending on whom one asks. <br />
<br />
Besides, changing things =/= &quot;messing it up&quot;. Much like Hans Zimmer ain't the only good movie composer, Russel Brower ain't the only good game music composer.<br />

<br />
I'm not one for conspiracy theories, I'm merely stating facts about the profitable state of the game. A source of revenue pulling close to 1 billion USD on a bad year, and over 1 billion USD on good years, is not exactly something to scoff at.<br />
<br />
And you seem to focus on 1 aspect. Character transfers are, like subs, not the only source of income. I've for example not paid real money for character services in 4 years.</div></div><hr />

Lots of people play with wow tokens.... wow tokens that someone else has to buy for real money at 50% more cost than a monthly sub. That off sets some of the lost subs.</div></div><hr />

In all honesty, it's no exaggeration for some.

<br />
Tokens, mounts, services, stuff for OTHER Blizz games, etc. Everything can be bought w/ WoW token.<br />
<br />
In NA each purchased WoW token earns them extra $5, someone else has to buy it for $20, you redeem it for $15.<br />
<br />
People are much more eager to purchase stuff from Blizz store if they pay w/ B.net balance, in their minds they pay w/ in-game gold and not w/ RL currency.<br />
<br />
For instance, I'd never pay €150 w/ RL money to transfer my chars to another realm, I didn't really need to do so, my prev realm was okay-ish, but I play AH a lot and I had enough gold to do so. So I bought 12 tokens (someone bought from Blizz for €20), redeemed them for €156 (12 * €13) and I spent €150 for B.net balance. Blizz got a nice bonus of €84 (12 * €7) just because I chose to pay for stuff w/ &quot;gold&quot;.<br />
<br />
People also redeem tokens for game time :p<br />

Wow is not one of them. It utilizes music only in cutscenes to invoke some sort of emotion or as ambient background. When i played ff14 and raided briefly it made me realize that music can work very well in dungeons and raids to amplify the atmosphere, even when its more on the foreground, Oh well, looks like wow wont get any cool boss battle music.</div></div><hr />

They're not hiding their quarterly profit numbers in any shape or form. If you, and I sure hope so, meant to say sub numbers, those are not the only way to gauge the health of games I hope you know. It's telling though that people just assume out of wishful thinking that them remaining true to their decision must equal that the game is still bleeding subs. Meanwhile, profits manage to go up somehow... <br />
<br />
Wonder if you people be as eager to sing this same old tired song 10 years from now when we've had 5 more expansions and the game still keeps ticking. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Subs are going down, but they are milking money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
They're hiding the sub numbers because they are way, way down from the peak times and look bad at earnigs calls and thus focus on other things. Kinda shame since as a player, healthy population number is much more important information than how much money they investors will be getting this quarter.</div></div><hr />

Then why hide them when for years you proudly boasted them? Oh maybe because they were dropping with every expansion....yeah that kinda makes sense now doesn't it. It's not a healthy game anymore, look at top end guilds just saying &quot;buh bye&quot; in recent years. But keep on pretending that WoW is going to go on for 10+ more years.</div></div><hr />

I'll be playing this game 10 years from now.

You don't need to pretend they are not hiding them. Most of us arent that naive and dumb as the same fanboys, that screeched before how Blizzard revealing their subs made them credible and its the only valid proof of a MMOs health, now try to pass everyone off, with this blind defense of Blizzard making a cut on the bad news. They never replaced them with any 'more' accurate/fitting figures as they claimed for damage controll. They just kept it dragging until the 'sinking' was undeniable and the fans excuses on the net turned more and more to excuses rather than denial only a few dead beat fanboys still seem to carry on with.<br />

And from playing the game rather than spending my time doomsaying about it on a forum, I can say that Legion is far more active than WoD was during those final months. Even at its worst, this game held 5 million players. And yet we have clowns sitting around saying &quot;Hurr it'll be dead in 5 years tops!&quot;. <br />
<br />
Yeah, just as how &quot;it'll be dead after WOTLK&quot; was the go-to argument for the doomspeakers way back when. You people are more repetitive than Jehova's Witnesses constantly moving their goalposts for the rapture.<br />

Ah smartass response, laughing away the anxiety, obscuring your argument with some vague 3rd party quotes dodging the point worse even your self in another, and claiming victory. A fanboy classic .<br />

Once more you're shockingly unable to relay what you're actually trying to say. I'll just take a wild stab at your point and counter it from there. <br />
<br />
There are financial reports for every year, they're very much public and display that WoW is still a financial spearhead for the company. It's cute though just how invested you are in believing otherwise<br />
<br />
Those numbers are for 2016, when 2017's financial report is concluded, it'll be equally public. You're trying to deny that they're making these things public despite the proof being right there in front of you.<br />
<br />
Q1 of 2017 has been made public as well, knock yourself out trying to deny that they haven't been.</div></div><hr />

Damn, I'm actually pretty bothered by this one. WoW music is one of my absolute favorite aspects of the game. Say what you want about the gameplay, but the music has always been quality.<br />

Funny thing is just how hated MoP's music is/was... It had some amazing scores, but somehow a large group of people defined the expansion by the kazoo inn-music (which I think is adorable in itself)...<br />
<br />
I'm guess that we'll still see his works from time to time though, seeing as how he's apparently excited about freelancing jobs for Blizzard.<br />

This is what happens when Blizzard contracts everything out except a few roles. The quality of the game has taken an absolute dive, and will continue to do so as they whore themselves out. But, who are we kidding? The glory days of this game are long behind it.<br />
<br />
If the quality has taken an &quot;absolute dive&quot;, then every expansion before Legion must've been worse than WoD... Which of course doesn't hold up.<br />
<br />
The production quality of the game has never been higher though, and WoD was a badge of shame for a reason rather than the norm. Even though some brainiacs actually do sit around pretending that Legion is less of an expansion than WoD was...</div></div><hr />

Honestly, that linked earnings call doesn't really boast with WoW numbers. It's company wide numbers.<br />
<br />
Last year this little thing called Overwatch launched, boosting company numbers immensely. And Legion's launch, like any expansion, brought boost to Wow at end of the year. But what is 2017 status for WoW?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Record profits all around, including WoW, and that's just the first quarter. <br />
And they obviously don't use the revenue success from other games to fictionally boost some illusion of success for potentially worse off- games. No single game of theirs are marked as sinking in revenue. <br />

Still not over the fact they are hiding both WoWs revenues and subnumbers? Take your own advice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you talking about the hard figures that spelled 'sinking' no matter how you turned them before Blizzard stopped reportint any exclusively WoW related figures and started hiding them in a large pool of other revenues or some numbers you made up in your head?<br />
<br />
Pot calling the kettle black? Where are your facts to back up any of your claims?<br />
<br />
Looking back to 2008, it shows they've included WoW's subscription revenue in the 'subscription, licensing and other revenues' category. Are you getting your numbers from somewhere else or are you actually looking to pre WOTLK numbers?<br />
<br />
They did lose quite a few subscribers in Q1 2015, but that coincides with the 6.1 Twitter Integration. The last reported sub number appears to be 5.5m subs at the end of Q3 2015. While it's not close to the peak, they surely can't sustain with those numbers. :rolleyes: <br />

I'll be playing this game 10 years from now.

I guess thats a pretty clear 'I cant cite the 2 numbers I base all my claims of because they are not actually there' and 'Yes they hide the subscriber numbers now' .<br />
<br />
Also its not illegal to stop breaking down your revenues to more smaller business units and hide a specific games revenue or profits in a large pool of other revenues or profits. Otherrwise Blizzard would have gotten in trouble after hiding WoWs revenues just like they did with the subs. I guess you are either deliberately missing the point because you know you are wrong or really clueless.</div></div><hr />

You might as well give up on this guy, man. He's going to think whatever he wants to think regardless of the facts. You can give him all the info avaiable out there, and he still won't take it. He's on a fansite for a game he clearly hates just to be negative. It's such an odd mindset that has come to the internet gaming people. Like, when they stop enjoying a game, then it must be over with and everyone should hate it. If not everyone hates it or agrees that it's dying, then they have to just sit around a fansite forum telling everyone there how terrible things are for the game and how it'll be dead soon.</div></div><hr />

Dont be silly<br />
<br />
This argument is on one part about feelings vs latest numbers, that havent been posted thousand of times in several dozen dedicates monthy threads already like the 12 Million tanking to half its size. Where not gonna quote Blizzard office number every time to proof the company actually exists and other trivia. Don't pretend you haven't seen these charts with the hard numbers a hundred times at least and dozen times on the front page of this very site. <br />
https://cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6995089/world_of_warcraft_subs.0.jpg<br />
<br />
On the other hand it was about was sinking or not sinking based on actual facts rather than feelings in the past (of course before Blizzard started hiding the numbers because we need facts to say something based on facts). It wasnt at any point about 'not being able to sustain with 5,5 Million subs' or whatever red hering strawman fallacy you just tried to play. <br />
<br />
Now do you need more than the tanking from 12 to 5.5 Million subs curve until Blizzard just cut the reports off, as proof that well it was definitely sinking and that wasn't just hat0rz making up stuff? Tell me what would convince you if not that? Or do you trust more in personal anecdotes? And if that curve doesn't scream sinking then our problem is not the numbers but your very uncommon definition of 'sailing fine' Its almost silly to dispute that at this point.<br />
<br />
As for the financial aspect he is the one inventing new facts about WoWs profitability, not me. Dont ask me to prove something thats isnt even in the document when thats exactly my point he pretends to miss. I have asked three of four times just for quotes of these current WoWs profits and revenues. He has explicitely refused to prove his point quoting even a single number after writing so much evading nonsnese, not even something logically implying his 'real' feelings should be right. I wouldn't even have asked for this if I didn't already knew they where not there. So figures hes just just another person making up shit or talking shit about stuff they dont actually understand.<br />
<br />
And vague links to far too general sites maybe or maybe not containing some evidence or proof for your claim or implication they do aren't backup to your claims Mr Kettle. Just save them for yourself if you are too lazy to pull them out, especially when its some place everyone knows already, as smart as some of you might think you are after finding Blizzards IR page after a million posts debating over them over the past 10 years ever three months for weeks. Othewise I refer you to www.google.com which has all information proving me right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously I don't know shit about Blizzard inner working and their policies, but if you think about it - his position wasn't only composer. He was also Sr. Audio Director which means he was probably overseeing ALL sound work being done for WoW or even the entire Blizzard. And that not only a lot of work it is also a lot of risk of being dependant on one guy. So this “sound de-centralization” initiative sound a lot like they trying to move at least sound localisation to their local staff in Europe and Asia. And after that his composer job wasn't enough to justify full time employment. We get new music how often? Every two years? Do you think it takes him two years to create new soundtrack, especially when he isn't the only composer on the team?</div></div><hr />

Also WoW cannot simply die. As long as the source code exists on the internet, it will always be playable.<br />
<br />
You're the one insinuating the game is &quot;dying&quot;. Not once did I mention that the game was going to cease to exist or &quot;die&quot;. The game is simply on the down-curve and will simple continue to decrease in subscribers as it is currently doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think the music has consistently gotten better, then Brower wasn't the MVP. Neal Acree has been credited for most of the music since Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
My point being, the music isn't going to change suddenly or lose quality, as the sound team has several composers that have worked with this man for a long time and know his style. Besides, if Blizzard ends up getting rid of the sound team and starts hiring specific artists for specific themes instead, Brower could still get a lot of the contracts, they'd just be mixed with pieces from different artists, potentially adding variety to each expansion.</div></div><hr />

Wonder how long it will be before we get the usual &quot;another rat fleeing the sinking ship&quot; crap?<br />
<br />
I'll be honest - “sound de-centralization” initiative, my current position of overall Sr. Audio Director/Composer is no longer relevant and is being eliminated., and them essentially laying off someone as talented as he is, is at the very least eyebrow raising. Most company's would fight tooth and nail to keep this kind of talent on board. <br />

Looks to me he got fired. Most likely due to with reorganizations / rebuilding the sound design team and he didn't really fit / wanted any other spot that most likely would be a downgrade for him.<br />
<br />
People that are fired are generally not allowed goodbye posts like this. He either faced a downgrade in job title/pay, or he was laid off. Either way, this is a loss for Blizzard, talent-wise.</div></div><hr />

To let talent like this go is a bad fucking decision - and if I know how corporations work, I'm seriously wondering if he was making too much money, and that's why they let him go. This is how corporations get rid of people, who make too much - they make their jobs redundant. <br />
<br />
This is definitely eyebrow raising.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Wonder how long it will be before we get the usual &quot;another rat fleeing the sinking ship&quot; crap?<br />
<br />
Difference is he was let go, he didn't decide to leave. So that argument is pretty invalid in this case.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pakheth</div><div class="date">2017-07-21, 10:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im actually kinda glad he is leaving. Don't get me wrong, he is great artist responsible for one of most iconic aspects of wow. Its just that after WoTLK, his work on wow became very...repetitive ? MoP had few good tracks, but both WoD and Legion really felt like more of we already have.<br />
<br />
I really hope someone with compltely fresh approach will work on music for 8.0 onwards.<br />
I fully agree. The music in general has been rather bland and repetetive for some time. MoP had a lot of great and varied songs, but both cata, wod and legion suffers from repetetions and remixing of the same songs over and over. The music list each expansion offer gets shorter and shorter. This frustrates me as the music tends to be rather noisy and therefore tiresome to listen to, which is a bad thing for videogame music that you will be encountering a lot. Also the flow of the songs tends to be irratic, usually starting out noisily then going calm, or going up and down, not deciding on what kind of music it wants to be. And to be honest, I hate music that blast in your ears the moment you enter a zone. I rather have it start slow, then build up, like it did with most zone music between vanilla and wotlk. especially in tbc. It usually helps a lot against music fatigue.</div></div><hr />

Yeah this says nothing about their overall profitability. If you cared to read it, Overwatch is the cash cow, not WoW.<br />
<br />
And yet they list their revenue increase as being forefronted by WoW and Overwatch. How does that fit your narrative? By any metric, a cash cow pulling 800k USD on a bad year is not exactly a dismissable force. <br />
<br />
You're hilarious though, so you keep doing you. The game has only passed its predicted death by people such as yourself by give or take 9-10 years by now, I'm sure you'll sing the same song 10 years from now all the same.<br />

you are either deliberately missing the point because you know you are wrong or really clueless.<br />
<br />
I'm not missing any &quot;points&quot;, since you're literally not making any others than ones based in your own wishful thinking and conspiracy theories. <br />
I don't entertain this stupidity anymore, people whom are so invested in this company/any of their games performing poorly were old news 9 years ago when I was convinced by forumgoers that WoW was ending after ICC. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
You might as well give up on this guy, man. He's going to think whatever he wants to think regardless of the facts. You can give him all the info avaiable out there, and he still won't take it. He's on a fansite for a game he clearly hates just to be negative. It's such an odd mindset that has come to the internet gaming people. Like, when they stop enjoying a game, then it must be over with and everyone should hate it. If not everyone hates it or agrees that it's dying, then they have to just sit around a fansite forum telling everyone there how terrible things are for the game and how it'll be dead soon.<br />
<br />
Yeah... You've pretty much summed it up. I'mma stop entertaining these kinds of people altogether, because just as WoW keeps ticking, they keep hanging around to hate on it.<br />
<br />
Aside from earnings calls, the proof that the game moves forward is in the fact that it still runs with more to come. It's held true 4 expansions beyond the projected cutoff, it'll continue on as long as the game remains profitable.</div></div><hr />

That is a load of crap and you know it.<br />
<br />
One of Blizzard's long-standing problems with their employees is there had been no room for advancement, hence why people would leave and work for Riot or something. Now that the people on top are leaving advancement opportunities suddenly start opening. <br />
<br />
That people weren't leaving Blizzard is really the unusual thing.</div></div><hr />

Right here are the composers for Legion:<br />
<br />
Russell Brower<br />
Neal Acree - Contracted by Blizzard since TBC<br />
Sam Cardon - Contracted by Blizzard since MoP<br />
Edo Guidotti - Contracted by Blizzard since Wrath<br />
Glenn Stafford - Senior Composer and still at Blizzard<br />
Derek Duke - Music Director and still at Blizzard<br />
David Arkenstone - Contracted by Blizzard since TBC<br />
<br />
<br />
Many of your old time Blizzard songs and vanilla WoW were by Matt Uelmen who left Blizzard in 2005 (Russell was hired to replace him) after the Blizzard North shutdown and now works for Runic Games, Derek Duke whose been at Blizzard since 2001, and Glenn Stafford whose been at Blizzard since 1993.<br />
