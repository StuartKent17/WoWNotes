That's the point. Threat was THE number one issue for DPS in vanilla. The bosses hardly had mechanics. Open world mobs today have more abilities than Molten Core bosses.</div></div><hr />

Didn't know vanilla released in 2015 mate.<br />

Additionally, yes, it has some initial snap threat, but not like the ridiculous amount of threat it pushes out now. Warriors are not supposed to keep aggro on mages arcane exploding everything down.<br />

Demo shout should still be used in heavy AoE situations and will still generate the most threat- it did in actual vanilla. To my understanding it was just simply doing too much, it shouldn't do so much threat that a mage spamming AoE can't peel any mobs off you.</div></div><hr />

Sarcastic reply, but please tell me how prot paladins are worth a shit without a taunt and without ways to regen mana in combat. They are irrelevant. They can tank 5 mans but at that point you might as well just heal because it's a waste of gold on the re-spec because it's worthless in raids.<br />
<br />
BC fixed prot paladin tanking and made them viable, anyone trying to use them in classic gets 4 face palms out of 5. They are not used for AoE raid tanking like they where in BC, let's cut the BS about it being their niche lmao.<br />

Digging that hole even further. This isn't what skittish is. Skittish reduces the threat the tanks do by a flat amount, making it slightly more relevant and adding something to pay attention to.<br />
<br />
This is how most MMOs where outside of the Cata-&gt;Legion hey day of threat being free simply by attacking a mob. Threat is not supposed to be free in Classic. Do you understand now? Or do you think &quot;random aggro drops&quot; are a thing lmao.<br />

My point was that because even most of the bosses in Naxx had perhaps two abilities DPS needed to watch out for, that not pulling aggro was the number one problem/issue for DPS.</div></div><hr />

First of all, seal of wisdom, mp5 gear/buff, mana potions, clever use of spell ranks etc. Second of all, I never talked about raids or raids bosses specifically here. I was talking about dungeons primarily (even though I never stated that). I know not having a taunt or any kind of distance closer is a real issue which makes them unsuitable to tank most raid bosses. However, there are still quite some bosses where they serve a purpose. Tanking adds or just raid trash for example.<br />

I totally understand the shortcomings of the class and I am fine with that and no where did I state otherwise. So yes, you totally deserved that sarcastic reply for assuming whatever.</div></div><hr />

Threat is meaningless vs i cant possibly generate enough threat are again 2 completly different things. No one asks for one thunder clap beeing enough threat for the whole mob, but working as hard as possible and doing everything a tank can and still not beeing able to hold agro is stupid and was surely not intended.</div></div><hr />

Except it is. You know why the MT gets all the best gear first in Classic? Because your DPS is limited by the amount of threat the MT can do. You are not meant to hold aggro against a dps of similar gear level going balls to the wall, you're playing the wrong game in classic if you expect it to be that way.</div></div><hr />

I agree on the prot paladin thing. Trying to tank something on a prot paladin was an effort in futility. This idea that they were viable tanks came later and thanks to pservers. Saying one was a prot paladin main in Vanilla is about the same as saying they were a melee hunter. ;/ <br />
<br />
On the other thing, the MT got the gear first to survive the hits, not because of threat. Classic difficulty increase philosophy was &quot;make the tank get hit harder.&quot; so it made sense to funnel gear at that point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhh, most of the gear you give the MT has nothing to do with survival and has everything to do with increasing their DPS, aka TPS. You think you give the MT the first thunderfury to &quot;survive hits&quot;? lol. You think horde groups put a windfury totem in the MT group to &quot;survive hits&quot;? lol. Surviving boss hits is hardly an issue, and bosses in current retail are far more dangerous to tanks then they ever where in classic. Nobody gives MTs gear first in retail, because it doesn't increase raid DPS the most- like it did in vanilla/classic.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it's sad because you're so right on the paladin issue and you're so wrong on this one. Thunderfury is the one exception where you're going to significantly increase threat output with a singular gear upgrade. The design philosophy right up until somewhere in Wrath was that to make encounters harder they had to hit harder. There's a great interview about that somewhere in the archives of the internet. Obviously modern encounters are harder, there's a better design philosophy for raiding now, but back in the days of Vanilla-Wrath where encounters were mechanically simple a lot of the difficulty came from the mobs hitting harder. Funneling the gear to the tanks had everything to do with survival. <br />
<br />
The damage increase from one tier to the next for tank gear is quite small. The damage output on mobs is quite high. It's all about making the tanks survive. Tank gear aside from the random piece here and there with hit didn't start having great threat stats until Naxx. The funnel gear to your tanks strategy started long before that, and died right after they swapped to a better design philosophy than &quot;LOL MOB HIT HARDER.&quot;</div></div><hr />

One thing is clear- you probably played vanilla, probably even thought you where right because there where plenty of bad players that even went with the &quot;give tank gear so they can survive&quot; statement hell, some lower end guilds still do that. But it's completely false, there is a reason funneling gear to the MT died at the exact same time threat died as a mechanic in the game. At least among top guilds.<br />
<br />
A tank didn't need all the gear to survive a hit from a boss in vanilla, being as geared as the average raid member is more then enough. They needed that gear to hold threat and increase total raid DPS as a result.</div></div><hr />

You're wrong. Go look at Vanilla WoW raid gear. Gear funneling to tanks existed since the start, but tank gear didn't start getting threat stats until Naxx. Gear funneling to tanks died off long after threat being an issue did btw. Why do you think things like Styleen's were so valued instead of more offensive options? I don't think I'm right, I know I'm right. The DPS increase for a tank between tiers was minimal, the damage reduction was massive. Nobody in Vanilla funneled gear to their tanks because it increased threat (aside from TF)</div></div><hr />

getting threat was the core tank gameplay before they changed it to focus much more on the staying alive part. the reason they changed is cause while threat was a fun mechanic for the tank, it wasn't for the dps.</div></div><hr />

Something felt off about that, and now I know why - it was a bug. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying him or anyone else who used it to generate big threat was cheating or anything - they may have legitimately thought Demo Shout was correctly generating that much threat. Heck, private servers may have had that level of threat, so it might have felt normal for those coming from private servers (not Asmongold).</div></div><hr />

But it's completely false, there is a reason funneling gear to the MT died at the exact same time threat died as a mechanic in the game. At least among top guilds.<br />
<br />
A tank didn't need all the gear to survive a hit from a boss in vanilla, being as geared as the average raid member is more then enough. They needed that gear to hold threat and increase total raid DPS as a result.<br />
<br />
Wrong. There's a reason tanks have separate threat gear and survival gear - to optimize for your current setup. You also don't give your tank Lionheart Helm first, despite it being the best helmet for threat. Why? Survival. Many T2 pieces are worse for threat than T1 pieces - do tanks pass on those? Of course not. Why? Survival.</div></div><hr />

The only reason paladins and bears weren't seen as main tanks is that they can't be uncrittable to a raid boss (+3 levels). It's not conducive to a successful raid if more than half of a tank's health gets taken on a single melee hit. Paladins and bears can tank everything else in the game, including raid trash, just fine.</div></div><hr />

Gear funneling to tanks existed since the start, but tank gear didn't start getting threat stats until Naxx. Gear funneling to tanks died off long after threat being an issue did btw. Why do you think things like Styleen's were so valued instead of more offensive options? I don't think I'm right, I know I'm right. The DPS increase for a tank between tiers was minimal, the damage reduction was massive. Nobody in Vanilla funneled gear to their tanks because it increased threat (aside from TF)<br />
As a former raidleader from MC to Naxx in Classic, I can confirm. We equipped the tanks first especially because of survival, not DPS or threat (tanks did shitty dps back then anyway).</div></div><hr />

<br />
aoe tanking while a mage goes balls deep spaming max rank arcane explosion was never a thing in classic, shout tanking was a thing in classic but mostly to keep agro from healer and only for the first seconds of a pull or for incoming extra adds(patrols,etc), then you go cleaving and tab sundering, shield slamming and revenge throught the pull keeping the focus at your priority(mostly using SS at cd on focus while tab targetting the rest), and keeping demo shout active to reduce dmg, also if you can stance dance after securing aggro to further reduce dmg taken switching to battle stance and do a thunder clap, then switching back to defensive, u can go to berseker to use berseker rage to increase your rage gen<br />
<br />
edit: and that was the standard aoe tanking of warrior up to wotlk when they buffed thunder clap (only usable in battle stance in vanilla, then in BC was usable on defensive but its aggro was shit), shit that is still the way of aoe tanking on skittish when avatar is on cd</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Loveliest</div><div class="date">2019-09-12, 07:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh my deer sweet child, I'm going to guess you are one of the players on live that don't understand why skittish exists either right?<br />
<br />
Why does skittish exist? I mean sure, if a geared warrior jumps in with bladestorm and your AoE spells are on CD, it makes a difference. Live and skittish aren't the best example.<br />
<br />
Back in the day threat was one of the few metrics you could identify a 'good' tank by. If (s)he held threat, the tank was good. If not, dpses and healers were mowed down. As such a tank, it made you feel good, people appreciated you. But here's the thing, threat was supposed to be a mechanic for all the party members, not just the tank. In reality, you ended up tanking both the mobs AND your party, watching out for threat could be taxing - especially with dpses with no self preservation ignoring your marks and attacking randomly. So tanking could end up not being fun - I actually remember raging quite a lot back in the day - &quot;Look at that rogue going for the one ranged target that's not brought to the group yet etc etc&quot;.<br />
<br />
So threat in general, while I found it quite fun to manage (even with the raging), was not as fun for quite a lot of people who thought they wanted to tank (see the harsh drop in tanks at the start of Cata when threat was a thing again). Losing aggro and getting people killed would most likely end up with people bitching and telling you you're a bad tank, dpses were hardly ever called out.<br />
<br />
Threat could have been a fun thing, but time has proven that your role being dependent on random people is a recipe for disaster and should be avoided. Skittish is a thing now ONLY because M+ are &quot;hand made&quot; groups of supposedly coordinated people who aren't totally clueless. And exactly because of that, skittish is kinda irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

Bears can also main tank every raid boss in vanilla (incl. all of naxx) and their BiS gear is a combination of AQ offset and leveling gear. Their health pools and armor are so massive vs warriors that the crits aren't really an issue + some bosses (like Patchwerk) cannot crit.</div></div><hr />

Not really annoying, tell your healer to not heal people who have aggro, and do not chase mobs to taunt them back, let the casters come to you, they will learn as their dps goes down when they are getting hit, and have to run to you. <br />
I always put a skull on mobs as dps if the tank doesn't. <br />
<br />
It should never be annoying for you, cause people are fast learners if you do it this way. It's easier if you pair up with a friend or two. People have forgotten that taunt is melee range now also. Hard lessons make better teamplayers.</div></div><hr />

#nochanges<br />
<br />
...btw that means no changes from 1.12 reference client, not no changes once released. fixing a bug that prevented a mechanic from being faithful to the 1.12 client is faithful to the #nochanges mantra. i am pro-#nochanges\<br />
<br />
though to be frank, #nochanges would also mean reproducing the behavior of now-protected API to be allowed to be run by unsigned code as long as it was triggered from a hardware event. This would restore addons such as Decursive's 1.12 behavior, but it would also open up an extremely harmful category of addons that completely play your character for you which boils down to &quot;1-button macros&quot;. I'm not talking about &quot;swifty 1 shot macro&quot;. I'm talking about macros that would make decisions for you; &quot;if A then cast B elseif C then cast D elseif E then cast F...&quot; etc. Blizz drew the line at that and, while it bothers me this change was made, it was healthy for the game. If this change was not made, it would open up a terrible can of worms and stigma against a person if they did or did not use &quot;1-button macro&quot; addons and create a divide among the playerbase, removing players from groups if they did or did not use such an addon.</div></div><hr />

It isn't even entirely true that Shaman, Druid and Paladin cannot main tank they just need more passive mitigation to get close enough to push the crushing blow off of the damage table or close to it, they will get hit by one eventually but for the most part out gearing a give raid is more than enough to start main tanking it as any of the other tanking specs.

Demo shout spam for tanking mass pulls was possible in the original game as was battle shout spam in a group with 4 hunters + 4 pets. My guild did both starting in BWL for Razorgore and Nef. The reason it's getting 'fixed' now is because it's getting popular traction due to all the power leveling and dungeon farm happening and not because it is a bug that wasn't part of the original experience.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">relaxok</div><div class="date">2019-09-12, 06:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Exactly, the strategy for razorgore was just to go in circles around the ramps spamming demo shout. This is like being able to DI razorgore to skip phase 1. Now clearly its a bug, but it was a bug that was in vanilla the whole freaking time.<br />

That’s not true, I OT’d that fight and it was spamming piercing howl to kite not demo shout for some other reason</div></div><hr />

Piecing howl just slows them down, Demoralizing shout keeps aggro. You have to use both for it to work. Anyway it was there in vanilla, blizzard nerfed it after a lot of people started using it and thats fine but devs need to come clean and say they put a fix from a later patch in an older one, not some cryptic bullspit like they did here to confuse everyone.</div></div><hr />

This almost certainly won't happen for a variety of reasons. Primarily because it opens the door to other fixes/changes that they don't want to put the time into doing. This got changed because of the popularity it got in power leveling/gaming. Not because it didn't exist in Vanilla or 1.12. They're likely just planning on relying on the communities lack of information to pass it off as a simple bug fix to maintain the integrity of 1.12. It's not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Demo shout was generating too much threat. In Vanilla it would normally deal X threat to each mob. It was instead dealing X threat to each mob for every mob that it hit. So if it normally would do 50 threat, and you hit 5 mobs with it, it would now do 250 threat to every mob. <br />
<br />
Battle shout was generating too little threat. In Vanilla it would normally deal X threat for every player buffed to all mobs. So if it generated 50 threat and hit 5 players in the group, it would generate 250 threat to all enemy targets. If there were 5 enemy targets, it would deal 250 threat to all of them. Instead, this was being split across mobs with threat. So instead of 250 threat to every mob, it was dealing 50 threat to every mob if there was 5 targets. <br />
<br />
In Vanilla, Demoralizing shout would do the same amount of threat regardless of how many targets you hit. In Classic it was scaling up in a stupid way the more things you hit with it. In Vanilla, Battle Shout would scale up with how many people you hit by it, and apply that to all all targets. In Classic instead it would get weaker the more targets that were around as it would divide threat by that number. <br />
<br />
In Vanilla, Battle Shout was typically better threat than Demoralizing Shout as long as you were buffing your whole party and they were on the threat list. Demoralizing shout was better on pull if you're not on everything's threat list, but otherwise Battle was better. Most players didn't have a strong understanding of this because these mechanics were kind of hiding and the numbers themselves were pretty low. Doing something like Razorgore Eggs for instance demo shout works predictably and has a very similar impact to battle shout if you can only guarantee hitting yourself. In fact, in many ways it's better because you can ensure you're just putting threat on your targets and not the ones across the room. <br />
<br />
But if you can buff your group, and you want threat on everything, battle shout was the way to go.<br />
<br />
I knew something was wrong because Battle Shout was falling way behind Demoralizing Shout when it should have been ahead, and Demoralizing shout was doing way more threat than it should especially as more mobs were affected.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if they ever fixed it but it sounds similar to this.</div></div><hr />
