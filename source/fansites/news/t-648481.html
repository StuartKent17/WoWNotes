PTR 3.1.2 - Build 9901<br />
A new build has been deployed on test servers, a few interesting changes have been made to Lake Wintergrasp. <br />
Lake Wintergrasp<br />
Wintergrasp Victory (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=56902) now rewards 3000 Honor. (Down from 5000 Honor)<br />
Wintergrasp Defeat (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=58494) now rewards 1250 Honor. (Down from 3000 Honor)<br />
Tower Damaged (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59135) now grants up to 750 Honor. (Down from 1250 Honor)<br />

Cripple (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=89) now increases time between melee and ranged attacks by 20%. (Down from 45%, already hotfixed on live servers)<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
Herald of the Titans (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=3316) Changes<br />
In this minor content patch, we'll be updating this achievement from the item level 226 requirement to an item level 232 requirement. Bear in mind that the description text of the achievement in the client will likely not be updated in this patch and will still reflect the outdated data. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/16903640039-ulduar-10player-hard-mode-weapons-update.html))<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp ... a failure?<br />
I think it's a little early for such a prediction based on the announced change to Lake Wintergrasp quests. We're looking into, and working on many different potential ways to keep Wintergrasp and our battlegrounds fun, engaging, and both great means of obtaining honor.<br />
<br />
It was referred to as a failure and future ghost town before the expansion released. Clearly that hasn't been the case, but we've learned how the design and appeal of the zone can lead to performance issues if too many players are crowded into a relatively small space. Our ultimate goal is not to make the zone less appealing, but to increase the appeal of battlegrounds and change the way questing in Wintergrasp works to hopefully throttle the participation in any given battle.<br />
<br />
We very much like the zone and we want it to be functional above all else. The game play inevitably suffers when performance issues arise and it's our goal to address this from as many different angles as possible, none of which include implementing solutions to ensure &quot;no one will want to go anymore.&quot;<br />
<br />
We encourage players to provide us feedback on battleground queues and team balancing (i.e. matches starting with uneven numbers on each faction), and Lake Wintergrasp performance and honor viability once 3.1.2 is released. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16904078836-so-wintergrasp-is-officially-a-failure.html))<br />
<br />
Honor gain in Battlegrounds<br />
This is something we're visiting to some extent for the next major content patch. We want all of the battlegrounds to be as close as possible with regards to honor gains, and we want the length of individual matches in every battleground to be roughly the same. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16904078847-of-battlegrounds-and-honor.html))<br />
<br />
10/25 Man Dungeons<br />
The problem with this is that the people who want to do bigger 25 player raids would complain when only 10 player raids are available as we wouldn't have reached the 25 player ones yet, and then vice versa when we are adding the 25 player raid dungeons and ignoring 10 player raids. Making a raid dungeon is a lot of work and not something that is easy to complete.<br />
<br />
We went with this new model as it allows a progression path for players who want to do just 10 player raids and for those who want to do just 25 player raids. All players also get to experience all of the content that we worked on in the way that works best for them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16903520036-so-now-we-do-25p--.html))<br />
<br />
Alterac Valley<br />
We did everything but neglect Alterac Valley. We tested and experimented with numerous changes until we got it to a point where we feel matches can be completed in a reasonable amount of time, while the overall zone is still enjoyable and rewarding for the time spent there. We do agree that some of the changes made have diminished the need to engage enemy players a little too much. We also understand that Alterac Valley matches are the most prone to starting with uneven numbers on either side right now, but that's an issue to be addressed via the queuing system and functionality.<br />
<br />
There are ways we'll be looking to bring back some pretty epic battles in our next battleground as well as improve the queuing system, but there are no major changes planned for Alterac Valley at this time, particularly not for those who want it reverted to the original version. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16904078836-so-wintergrasp-is-officially-a-failure.html))<br />
<br />
Crusaders can't run their Valiant daily quests<br />
While you aren't the only one, I turned in my tokens so I have less to do and wanted the Crusader title asap. We do plan to make some changes to how this works in a future patch that will smooth this out a bit.

Q: Will people outside of the United States be able to purchase the online stream and receive the in-game pet?<br />
A: Yes, but there may be some limitations on countries that can do this. We will post more details regarding this when the online stream is available for purchase. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/25/16903578182-post-questions-here--also-questions-faqs.html))<br />

Unholy DPS too high?<br />
We think Unholy dps is probably too high on fights with adds, which ends up being a lot of Ulduar bosses. From looking at the numbers, the main culprit seems to be using Death and Decay, Unholy Blight, Pestilence and Blood Boil all together. None of those are a problem alone, but they work really well together. Unholy Blight is the spell we would most likely change. It has never really found a niche.

Fury DPS to be increased<br />
We are likely to buff warrior dps slightly in PvE. Fury likely needs more than Arms, but our intent for now is also to buff Arms a little. (Our intent could change of course.)<br />
<br />
We don't have any specific changes to announce. Do not expect to see a 20% jump in your numbers. Please do not interpret this as the class, stances or rage mechanics being re-designed. Look at our recent change to Lightning Overload as the kind of thing we might implement. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16903633680-warrior-dps-is-unacceptably-low-in-31.html))<br />

Earlier they changed WG dailys to being weekly (can only be done once per week), therefore they buffed the honor gains (which was still less than doing it each day). Now they are nerfing the honor gains from the weekly dailys. Double nerf.<br />

<br />
<br />
It's possible that these numbers are what you would receive if you were the sole person in WG, but then it's divided by a maximum of 10 people in the zone. If I, for instance, damage a tower, I currently receive 125 honor. When I destroy it, I receive another 125 honor. That appears to match up with what's said.

Last time I checked you needed PvP gear to compete in arena and WG has(had) by far the best time/honor ratio. Not to mention the trinkets and off-pieces bought with marks.<br />

But thanks for playing, BGs aren't PvP either.</div></div><hr />

It's being nerfed because it's being used to down hard-modes in ways that shouldn't be able to be done.<br />
<br />
I.E. Steelbreaker last.<br />
<br />
Place 3 warlocks in raid.<br />
Place 2 stam stacked Voidwalkers on Steelbreaker, 1 tanking, 1 building threat.<br />
Place Doomguard + warrior on steelbreaker to IMP TC + Cripple.<br />
The voidwalkers even though nerfed are now taking a CRAP ton of less damage.<br />
<br />
Now, they fixed the encounter itself by making pets still buff him, except they totally forgot that people can just despawn there pets.<br />
Doomgaurd was the allmighty in making a boss hit for a crap ton less. It's the #1 easiest way to do Vexas hardmode, XT hard mode, basically ANY boss hard-mode (that hits for more when hardmode is activated.</div></div><hr />

Wintergrasp Victory (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=56902) now rewards 3000 Honor. (Down from 5000 Honor)<br />
Wintergrasp Defeat (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=58494) now rewards 1250 Honor. (Down from 3000 Honor)<br />
Tower Damaged (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59135) now grants up to 750 Honor. (Down from 1250 Honor)<br />

Intact Building Defender (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=59203) now grants up to 1500 Honor. (Down from 2500 Honor) (Note: Currently shown as 150 Honor but most likely a typo)<br />
<br />
<br />
It's possible that these numbers are what you would receive if you were the sole person in WG, but then it's divided by a maximum of 10 people in the zone. If I, for instance, damage a tower, I currently receive 125 honor. When I destroy it, I receive another 125 honor. That appears to match up with what's said. Each tower would reward 75 honor for damaging it, and then 75 more for destroying it, for instance.<br />
<br />
Obviously a nerf, but not terribly severe. Maybe they will up the weekly quest rewards to compensate some? Maybe not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe they are all like the last comment &quot;typo&quot; and the last digit doesn't show so you actually gain 1250? Though will be &quot;75&quot; when patch hits.</div></div><hr />

Cripple isn't much of a nerf tbh, it's hardly used. And stating that Warlocks are fine and cannot get worse, then you must have stopped playing for a long time. Aslong as I got 21% damage reduction from crits and still get 7k+ crits from warlocks they are not fine...</div></div><hr />

To be honest, Noone cares about pvp anymore. This game will never be balanced.

I don't see why everyone cares about item levels so much. If they aren't changing the stats on them - who cares?

<br />
The WG honor &quot;nerf&quot; is to stop WG being something that you absolutely had to do every time there was a battle, as otherwise everyone else would be getting more honor than you did, and your PvP gear level would suffer as a result if you found WG too boring to be bothered with. It just puts it on a par with the battle grounds. Furthermore, the weekly quest reward honor gain was based around an assumption that you did the dailies 7 days a week. For most people, this isn't true, and it would have been an unnecessary buff to already easy-to-grind honor for those who can put 8 hours a day into doing so.</div></div><hr />

Depends on the class - as a Ret, Hammer of Crushing Whispers (http://www.mmo-champion.com/i/news/2009/april/04_26_9806_36.jpg) should be better, even blowing Earthshaper (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=45521) out of the water with its sockets, once the stats are updated.</div></div><hr />

Regardless, they're better than 25 man weapons, which is just stupid imo. To fuel the nerd rage - no, I don't think people who run 10 mans should have weapons that are as good as people who run 25s.

<br />
aoe fights are the only ones where i can sometimes make rank #1-3 in the meters, on vezax im something like #12 and ignis about #10...<br />
<br />
but its okay with me if ya nerf our aoe dmg a bit, but please leave our single target dps alone, if at all its too low :)</div></div><hr />

They'll buff 2h spec. Not even kidding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crushing whispers is only better than Aesir's if you need the hit rating, otherwise Aesir's is better. If the 3.1.1 stats are any indication, the two items are identical except the mace has hit and the sword has armor pen.<br />
<br />
As for your last comment there, I guess you could say that once you've downed both and therefore have points of comparison to actually draw from, rather than your own suppositions. Judging from your armory, you've not completed a single hard mode nor stepped foot in Uld 10, so you might want to refrain from such statements. <br />
<br />
In addition, I find it amazing how many people are so poorly informed about the stated intent for item progression. (I'm not talking about player progression, this is concerning itemization and proper stat allocation from budgets based on item level.) They said some time ago that the vision for this is:<br />
<br />
10m --&gt; 25m --&gt; 10m hard --&gt; 25m hard<br />
<br />
If you think normal 25 is actually more difficult than 10 hard, I'm sure your local police would be interested in what you're smoking.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have exactly opposite opinion -10 man hard modes are harder then 25 man normal modes. That's why it is logical that weapons will be above 25 man normal and below 25 man hardmode.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2009-05-14, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Obviously a nerf, but not terribly severe. Maybe they will up the weekly quest rewards to compensate some? Maybe not.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uh.... it's a 50% nerf to the honor gained in WG. That's pretty fucking severe.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On the topic of 10 man weapon - Aesir's Edge is now clearly the best melee weapon in the game until Voldrethar. <br />
<br />
There is just NO way that 10 man weapons should be that close to being the best. That would have been like Ashkandi dropping from Hakkar.<br />
<br />
<br />
It would only be like that if there was a 40 man Zul'Gurub with the same boss mechanics that had the only upgrades to the 10 man weapons.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;hard&quot; modes of most of the 10 man bosses are MUCH easier to down than 25 man hard modes. This isn't Sarth 3D anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Uh.... yes. That's why 25 man hard modes reward ilvl 239 loot, not ilvl232 like 25 man normal modes and (soon to be) 10 man hard modes.<br />
<br />
The comparison isn't between 10m hard modes and 25m hard modes, it's between 10 man hard modes and 25m easy modes. ANY hard mode is harder than the loljokes that are most Ulduar normal mode bosses (Mimiron/Yogg are the only decent normal mode bosses).</div></div><hr />

It depends on your rank (in the battle), if you are just a slacker you get a lot less</div></div><hr />

No.. Warrior DPS was to high compared to OTHER classes, not just arms.</div></div><hr />

you mean getting first lieutenant? Because I can assure you, you can be a complete slacker and still get max rank. You can go afk when the battle starts and get it lol.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure there was a better way to fix it like putting WG in an instance but I guess it's just easier to make sure less people play it meaning less lag.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sephirote</div><div class="date">2009-05-14, 10:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I think the easier way to fix this problem woul dbe to give the choice to do an AB with 40 peeps on each side and put 2 new flag raise the cap and do the same thing with the other BG and do the inverse with AV give the choice to do it with 15 peeps and put the AV less bigger.<br />
<br />
Like that people will have more BG to do and will eplxore something else new, so it's not everyone that will run in WG when it's up<br />
<br />
so u have the choice to make the old BG or the new version , and put daily in each with less points ( for the daily )<br />
like if u kill 3 peeps at every flag u gain 4gold and 400 Honor<br />
<br />
This is just an idea that I trow out like that so it's not perfec I know but still we would have less peeps in Wintergrasp and it would fix the latency problem</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or even better, elaborate. (That means explain, i'll make it simple for ya) and actualy tell us. Think you can do that without the condescending manner? Probly not you've yet to overcome your neanderthal needs to be the alpha male. Probly due to the fact your stature IRL! hasn't been kind enough to grant you the ability to do so.<br />

And the L2read statement doesn't really work on a forum, ya know where reading is pretty much mandatory<br />
