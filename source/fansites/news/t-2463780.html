Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Battle of Dazar’alor<br />
<br />
The achievement Can I Get a Hek Hek Hek Yeah? (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13316-can-i-get-a-hek-hek-hek-yeah) now requires all members of the raid click on the Mysterious Trashpile before the fight starts to receive Jani's Favor, and then complete the existing criteria for the achievement.<br />
Fixed a bug that prevented some players from receiving the achievement The Hidden Dragon on Normal difficulty.<br />
Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Arcane Torrent to remain available when changing factions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Emissary armor, weapon caches, and rewards from faction assaults now reward the item by loot specialization. These were previously rewarded by class.<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Sinister Gladiator's Safeguard (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165807-sinister-gladiators-safeguard)’s shield now has a duration of 6 seconds (was 10 seconds), and can now be dispelled.<br />
Dread/Sinister Gladiator's Emblem (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165056-sinister-gladiators-emblem) now has a duration of 20 seconds (was 15 seconds).<br />
Sinister Gladiator's Maledict (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165806-sinister-gladiators-maledict)’s heal absorption can now be dispelled.<br />
Xalzaix's Veiled Eye (https://www.wowdb.com/items/160653-xalzaixs-veiled-eye)’s shield can now be dispelled.<br />
<br />
Developers’ note: With the start of Battle for Azeroth Season 2, we introduced two new trinkets that are acquired via PvP, Sinister Gladiator’s Maledict and Sinister Gladiator’s Safeguard. In agreement with feedback we’ve been receiving, we’ve made a few changes to these items so that they provide more of an opportunity for counterplay when encountering enemy teams using these trinkets. We’ll continue to keep an eye on the strength of these trinkets as the season progresses.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Season 2 crafted Engineering goggles should now refund Tidalcores or Breath of Bwonsamdi and Expulsom when scrapped.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where Alliance players who had faction transferred to Horde could not see Nathanos in Dalaran to accept &quot;The Warchief Beckons&quot;.<br />
Nazgrim is once again available in Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar for Horde players on the questing experience to unlock Pandaria.<br />
<br />
<br />
World Quests<br />
<br />
Faction Assault World Quests now properly give credit for the Weekly Quest &quot;The World Awaits&quot;.<br />
Pets should now summon and path correctly on Airships during Faction Assaults.</div></div><hr />

Only took them five months! In another five months, who knows? Maybe they'll fix shamans and tanks.</div></div><hr />

So what does this mean exactly? Are assault rewards still locked at s1 370 even though it was introduced with 8.1 and spec specific loot is a s2 change? How hard has it become for them to communicate clear ffs.</div></div><hr />

It means what it says. from now on all hunters Don't get polearms from weapon chests (I'm a bit angry about this). It clearly states that. It also clearly doesn't state anything about item level.</div></div><hr />

This means that the weapon cache that rewarded my ilvl340-spear-wielding feral druid with a 370 INT off-hand this weekend will not piss me off next time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Communicate, like the whole post that explained each and every item level changes where Assault gear were clearly not listed. Look like it was a catch up mechanic. A piece of gear every 17 hours is a little too crazy to scale past LFR item level.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2019-01-24, 11:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It would be nice if you could just toggle which specs you can get loot for on and off. So a druid might be happy to get loot for Feral and Guardian but not Resto or Balance or someone who plays all their specs might just turn on loot for them all and not really worry what they get. Having to manually tweak loot spec for every boss gets a bit tiring if you play multiple specs.</div></div><hr />

Better late than never? It was so fun getting loot on alts that I was absolutely never going to use because I only play one spec on them, all while they kept saying how it was intended to be that way.</div></div><hr />

I don't know who'll be more excited this: me, a Druid, or my wife, a Rogue (Every time it's a weapon cache, she gets an axe and I have gotten so many AGI weapons and am still rocking a 340 main hand for my resto spec).</div></div><hr />

Another one crying how bad shaman and tanks are. I am pretty sure you are not optimal at both hence the crying, but hey it is the class not the player that is bad. I keep forgetting that. Or is it the other way around? Hmmmm......</div></div><hr />

A random troll appeared! It used Random Insult! It's not very effective.<br />
<br />
Please, oh high and mighty lord of the 3-post count, do tell me how Guardian druid raid and M+ representation are all the bear players' fault, and not the result of a spec balance issue.</div></div><hr />

You said tanks, you didn't point at one specifically<br />
<br />
Tanks are fine, Guardian druids are just not ideal</div></div><hr />

Tanks are far from &quot;fine&quot; all around. So let me guess: are you a DK or a monk?</div></div><hr />
