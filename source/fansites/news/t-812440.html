Master Riding now properly grant players 310% flight speed in Eastern Kingdoms with X-53 Touring Rocket, Celestial Steed, Headless Horseman's Mount, X-51 Nether-Rocket, X-51 Nether-Rocket X-TREME, and Invincible.<br />
<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds<br />
<br />
Battleground Demolishers in Strand of the Ancients have had their health lowered in all Battleground brackets except for the level 80-84 range, where their health has been increased.<br />
Lifegiving Seeds can no longer be used in Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Players who have the Insanity debuff can't benefit from Time Warp until the debuff has expired. Players can no longer benefit from both Ancient Hysteria and Time Warp prior to the Insanity Debuff fading.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..mage) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1669-Mage-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Frostfire Orb cannot trigger Fingers of Frost if Rank 2 of Frostfire Orb is not learned. Fingers of Frost functions normally otherwise. Note that the debuff will still appear on the target until a client-side patch is applied to correct this display issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..paladin) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1670-Paladin-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Zealotry no longer consumes the Hand of Light proc effect.<br />
Tower of Radiance no longer grants Holy Power from Holy Lights cast on a target buffed with Beacon of Light. It continues to work as the tooltip describes for Flash of Light and Divine Light. Please note the tooltip may not be updated to reflect this change until a client-side patch is applied.<br />
Healing done by Beacon of Light is now properly affected by healing modifiers on targets which reduce healing done (i.e. Mortal Strike).<br />
The healing done by Light of Dawn has been reduced by approximately 40%. Please note the tooltip may not be updated to reflect this change until a client-side patch is applied.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
<br />
The Looking For Dungeon random bracket for Throne of the Tides and Blackrock Caverns has been changed from level 80-81 to 80-82, and the specific bracket has been changed from level 80-83 to 80-85.<br />
<br />
Blackrock Caverns<br />
<br />
Twilight Dragonkin Armorers in Throne of the Tides and Blackrock Caverns now always drop some sort of loot. Get your Shimmering Claws while they're fresh!<br />
<br />
Blackwing Descent<br />
<br />
All four golems are now immune to Distract in the Omnotron Defense Council encounter.<br />
Poison Bombs in the Golem Council encounter will now only attack and explode on targets they're fixated on.<br />
The gate beyond Magmaw and Omnotron should not close after the bosses are killed if a soft reset takes place.<br />
The Orb of Culmination will now properly respawn after a soft reset takes place.<br />
<br />
Deadmines<br />
<br />
Ripsnarl's Summon Vapor mechanic now ignores line of sight and correctly spawns a Vapor in regardless of where players are standing.<br />
Glubtok can now be looted even if the party dies before he finishes his dramatic death sequence.<br />
<br />
Grim Batol<br />
<br />
Impaling Slam by Forgemaster Throngus now does much less damage, but is no longer mitigated by fire resistance.<br />
Players can now zone into the dungeon while another player is in combat with a boss.<br />
<br />
Halls of Origination<br />
<br />
Brann now correctly begins his event for &quot;Heart of the Matter&quot; if the player is mounted when the quest is accepted.<br />
There is now a teleportation device present at the front of the dungeon once Temple Guardian Anhuur has been defeated.<br />
<br />
Throne of the Four Winds<br />
<br />
You are now able to drink and eat after the party wipes. It's a sad day, after all, when the dead can't even enjoy delicious food and drink.<br />
The Ravenous Creepers in the Conclave of Wind encounter now properly retarget players on the western platform when their aggro target moves to another platform. Even when no players are available to target on the platform the Creepers will retarget any new player who arrives on the platform.<br />
<br />
The Vortex Pinnacle<br />
<br />
Characters who become stuck in a Slipstream are now properly dropped after a period of time and brought back to the platform via the Fall Catcher.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Amulet of Dull Dreaming and Acorn of the Daughter Tree had duplicate stats. That's no fun for anyone! Amulet of Dull Dreaming has a critical strike rating of 112 and a haste rating of 112. Acorn of the Daughter Tree has a mastery rating of 116 and a haste rating of 107.<br />
Captured Lightning from The Vortex Pinnacle now correctly has Spirit instead of hit rating. The item tooltip may not properly update to reflect this change, but the appropriate stats should be applied to a character when the item is equipped.<br />
Lifegiving Seeds can no longer be used in Battlegrounds.<br />
Shroud of the Dead, purchased from the Ramkahen Quartermasters in Uldum, is no longer Bind-on-Equip.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
The respawn rates for all Horde and Alliance Cooking daily quest objectives in Orgrimmar and Stormwind have been increased.<br />
The Alchemy mount Vial of the Sands is no longer Bind-on-Pickup.<br />
Corpses which have already been skinned should no longer sometimes remain, making players think they can still be skinned -- players who are then left saddened by false hopes.<br />
Players are no longer able to apply the Eternal Belt Buckle on belts higher than item level 300.<br />
The droprate on the Precious Locket from Royal Monkfish in Stormwind waters for the Fishing daily quest &quot;Big Gulp&quot; has been increased.<br />
Ethereal Ink sold by vendors was too expensive and now trades at a 1:1 ratio with Blackfallow Ink.<br />
Obsidium Ore nodes now spawn more frequently in Deepholm.<br />
Pristine Hides were too common and now have less of a chance to drop.<br />
The gem cuts Timeless Nightstone, Jagged Jasper, and Solid Zephyrite can no longer create perfect versions of the cut.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests &amp; Creatures<br />
Cataclysm Zones<br />
Deepholm<br />
<br />
Players that are not on the quest &quot;Wrath of the Fungalmancer&quot;, and are out of combat at the same time another player begins the Fungalmancer event, will not be placed into combat with Fungal Horrors that spawn during the encounter. All Fungal Horrors despawn as soon as Fungalmancer Glop is defeated. In addition, at no time should Fungalmancer Glop path through walls or terrain. Norsala respawns moments after a player completes the encounter.<br />
The quest &quot;Wayward Child&quot; can now be completed with Therazane regardless of the phase the player is in.<br />
Twilight Soulreapers and Defaced Earthragers no longer give any experience or loot when killed.<br />
<br />
Mount Hyjal<br />
<br />
All players who receive the raid victory message while on the quest &quot;Prepping the Soil&quot; will also receive quest objective completion.<br />
Lava Surgers were caught red-handed showing no loot. Showing no loot of an almost broken nature. This will not do. (They now drop loot and can be mined.)<br />
<br />
Tol Barad Peninsula<br />
<br />
Wandering Souls will now always drop a Cursed Femur for the quest &quot;Salvaging the Remains&quot;.<br />
Darkwood Broodmothers and Darkwood Hatchlings were sharing spawn locations, sometimes preventing one of the creature types from spawning. This has been corrected.<br />
The Magnatized Scrap Collector cannot be used outside the designated quest area.<br />
<br />
Twilight Highlands<br />
<br />
The cutscene for the quest &quot;Enter the Dragon Queen&quot; no longer breaks if someone skips the cutscene and more than one person is watching it.<br />
The ever-sneaky Cayden Dunwald should now always get attacked during the escort quest &quot;Once More Into The Fire&quot;.<br />
Baited Black Drakes were Deathwing wannabes and doing way too much damage with their fire breath. This damage has been reduced to ensure there is only one king of pain.<br />
To address a phasing conflict, players cannot accept &quot;Somethin' For The Boys&quot; until they've completed all three of the preceding quests, including &quot;They Took Me Pants!&quot;<br />
Axebite Grunts now despawn whenever the siege tanks get healed and leave, or if they get destroyed. The Siege Tank Commanders are now flagged as immune creatures and no longer get stuck in combat, which prevented players from interacting with them for the quest &quot;Siege Tank Rescue&quot;. In addition, players can no longer attack Siege Tank Commanders.<br />
Darunga's respawn time for the quest &quot;Doing It Like a Dunwald&quot; has been reduced. In addition, the corpses of Darunga and Jaspertip Crystal-Gorgers should no longer linger around for an inordinate amount of time.<br />
The Frothing Rage buff is now removed when players leave the zone.<br />
The ogres in Glopgut's Hollow now respawn at a higher rate than before.<br />
<br />
Uldum<br />
<br />
Harrison Jones will now spawn at the exact same time as the Obsidian Colossus for the quest &quot;Fortune and Glory&quot;.<br />
Engaging in PvP combat in Ramkahen now properly spawns guards.<br />
Wearing associated costumes for the quest &quot;Firing Squad&quot; when the cutscene plays should no longer result in event issues.<br />
Kill credit is now awarded to all party members for both the regular and daily versions of the quest &quot;Fire from the Sky&quot;. Missiles from other players are also visible to everyone now.<br />
Elite Troopers were way too elite and had triple the armor they're supposed to have. We've stripped them of some of their precious protection.<br />
All party members are now receiving credit for motivating a Slacking Laborer for the quest &quot;Make Yourself Useful&quot;. This is 100% more useful.<br />
<br />
Vashj'ir<br />
<br />
The quest &quot;Wake of Destruction&quot; now only requires players to devour 10 naga.<br />
Hallazeal the Ascended now despawns when a player leaves combat or logs out while being engaged with him.<br />
At the conclusion of the final cutscene for &quot;Defending the Rift&quot;, the quest completion NPC is visible for both factions.<br />
The Nespirah Fluid buff is now removed when players enter a dungeon, raid, or Battleground.<br />

US side: Premo got the world first nef kill since 25-man is harder then 10!<br />
<br />
EU side: NO, you got the patch that fixed the bugs earlier than EU!<br />
<br />
US side: You guys got the expansion a day earlier and a free reset!<br />
<br />
EU side: Well a kill is still a kill. You can't justify it because of the number of players. Blizz said that both are equally challenging.<br />
<br />
US side: Butthurt Europeans! Premos kill requiered more skill and coordination, screw what blizz says.<br />
<br />
US side: Yeah Paragon abused auras on LK!<br />
<br />
EU side: Still look at wowprogress, Paragon is still number 1!! U MAD AMERUKHUNS?!?!<br />
<br />
<br />
[And it continues like this until we get into a heated discussion between Football and American football, and someone comments on the use of football instead of soccer.]<br />

That really doesn't apply. Anyone who went to Howling Fjord has operated a similar device and is also proficient enough to ride motorbikes, drive tanks, etc Technically I know how to drive one on my warrior but I cannot remember how to turn it on since I dropped Engineering.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ugh, that's the reason is it? I'd been picking up the perfect solid zephyrites for my tank so far, the extra 8 stam per gem was pretty nice, and probably worth the small additional gold outlay. The one this i really hope is that they don't nerf gems that have already been applied - that'd just be annoying...</div></div><hr />

The gem cuts Timeless Nightstone, Jagged Jasper, and Solid Zephyrite can no longer create perfect versions of the cut.These 3 cuts are for the JC daily, as there was a problem of where if you cut a perfect stone of one of those three, you couldn't then turn it in as the quest wants just the normal versions.<br />
<br />
Instead of letting it work off of perfect cuts too, they just make it so you can't cut perfect stones for those specific cuts ever. Strange.</div></div><hr />

Adept was first US Kill, Paragon or Экзорсус was first EU, they killed it in 10man and are now on Hardmodes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sigh to save everyone some time/make the trolling less.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Either way GZ on the kill Premo!<br />
<br />
Premonition killed it 25man because they others had already cleared it and are now working on Hardmode content, Premonition was still one of the first 5 to clear and grats to them.<br />
<br />
&lt; ---- Australian without a bias to EU or US<br />

<br />
The Alchemy mount Vial of the Sands is no longer Bind-on-Pickup.The drake may no longer be BoP, but the recipe still is. This means that if I wanted the mount I would either have to pay an alchemist/archaeologist with the recipe enough to cover their crafting fee and the vendor items (and of course give them the other reagents), or level archaeology with my alchemist. So until they make the recipe BoE, some of us are still sad because archaeology takes a long time to level and not everyone had the foresight to level their alchemist's archaeology. :(<br />
<br />
But yeah, good news that it is BoE. We shall see these up on the AH starting at 50K pretty soon. Depending on supply, they will slowly dwindle down to 35K, but even then alchemists who manage to sell them will be making some nice profit - especially if they mine their own ore to transmute into Truegold! And with the guild perk that reduces vendor bought item costs, either the profit will be greater or the prices will go lower. Alchemists of course would hope for the former. XDCorpses which have already been skinned should no longer sometimes remain, making players think they can still be skinned -- players who are then left saddened by false hopes.And yet, everyone knows that Ghostcrawler feeds on both your tears and your false hopes. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not that I don't have mana issues, don't get me wrong, but it was possible through combined teamwork (CC, proper pulls, dispels / purges what not) to keep my mana pool around 50-80% during trash fights cause of a combination of Word of Glory + Holy shock + holy light.<br />
<br />
By the looks of it (again, haven't tried it out since the nerf), it seems like I'll be struggling on mana.<br />
<br />
I do know for a fact priests are having a rough time, although it does come down to team work + spec of the priest. A friend of mine started out with discipline for healing in Cataclysm heroics, then he tried out holy and now he doesn't have mana issues at all unless something bad happens such as double pull, bad CC or just people being morons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm healing is supposed to be more difficult and thinking about what you're doing + not being afraid of using your CDs, however it's still supposed to be possible to do a heroic within (in my opinion) an hour, not three.</div></div><hr />

Being able to only experience omnitron and magmaw in 10 man so far being a druid and healing with a shaman and paladin, i have to say that it was quite frustrating to see them dish out huge AoE healing for no mana cost ( beacon on tank, HL on tank and every 3 HP use LoD) and whilst the shaman and me were at 60-50% mana the paladin was happily spamming his heals around the raid staying at 90% mana with 9-11k hps.<br />

Gratz to Premonition on WORLD 1st 25 man. Thats right, beat Paragon because they didnt kill it on 25, but clearly since Boubouille is in love with Paragon he wont mention that, he clearly also has a problem with Adept who got US first Nefarian.<br />

Hi, you're a Priest who can't play his class. Welcome to life. I've seen a Priest in non-raid ready gear heal an entire group standing in the shield on the first boss in HC Vortex Pinnacle and finish on about 40% mana. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Holy Paladins no longer have a cheap go-to heal without a CD - HL heals about 4% of a tank's health, which is useless. At the same time Paladins have the weakest mana regen CD of any healer class; where everyone else's restores 30% or thereabouts with no drawback, Divine Plea restores at most half of that while simultaneously nerfing healing by 50% for 15 seconds. This is not a needed nerf to Holy Paladins. It is a disastrous error that completely removes Holy Paladin as a viable raiding spec.<br />
<br />
What's truly disgusting about the incompetence being displayed here is that the whole mess could have been fixed by reducing ToR's chance to proc from 33/66/100 to 25/50/75.</div></div><hr />

I've done Magmaw as a resto druid. Other healer was a disc priest and the other a holy paladin, and the scenario you described pretty much matched my raid exactly. The AoE damage would come in, I'd spin out rejuvs on the raid, Swiftmend (and by proxy, Efflore... Efflu ... that crazy green PBAoE heal I can never spell) the guy who got chucked into the air because he didn't move out of the ground heaving .... and I'd be damn near OOM. Meanwhile Mister Holy Pally is throwing out heals like it was going out of style. Managing raid damage is how I do as a resto druid, and to watch my mana bar GO AWAY from performing a basic resto druid function while a holy paladin does both the disc priest's job and my job at the same time with minimal mana cost ... well it burned my biscuits to say the least.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to go all &quot;HAHA SUCK IT HEALADINS&quot;, but really, the Cataclysm healing change (and the realization that came with it) should have hit them as hard as it did the rest of the healers. I haven't made as many scowling or sheer utter horrified panic expressions at my monitor while healing since I picked it up when ZA went live. Part of me is going &quot;oh, well it's good that it's not like ICC and I can fall asleep with my face on my keyboard&quot; and part of me is going &quot;OH GOD OH FUCK OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD OH GOD STOP TAKING DAMAGE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCCCK&quot;, so uh, yeah.</div></div><hr />

Stop doing this and you'll do a whole lot better, trust me. They nerfed Rejuvenation specifically to negate this style of healing. You actually have to manage cooldowns now for AoE parts of any given fight. Pro-tip: ToL and Lifebloom.</div></div><hr />

That's not what I meant. Read what I quoted. He is upset (using the word lightly) because Alchs didn't get an epic recipe and now what they do have everyone has access to it. That is easily comparable to the Engineer mount. And no, I don't care, what-so-ever. I've actually made and sold 4 choppers.</div></div><hr />

I understand, but like I said elsewhere, what does everyone care about being such a unique flower all the damn time? There are benefits to Alchemy that actually effect gameplay, but it's the vanity items -- items that now can make them an obscene amount of gold -- that trigger the QQ. I mean seriously people, it's a game, who cares if your best friend also has the Barbie Vette now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-12-15, 02:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not that I don't have mana issues, don't get me wrong, but it was possible through combined teamwork (CC, proper pulls, dispels / purges what not) to keep my mana pool around 50-80% during trash fights cause of a combination of Word of Glory + Holy shock + holy light.<br />
<br />
By the looks of it (again, haven't tried it out since the nerf), it seems like I'll be struggling on mana.<br />
<br />
I do know for a fact priests are having a rough time, although it does come down to team work + spec of the priest. A friend of mine started out with discipline for healing in Cataclysm heroics, then he tried out holy and now he doesn't have mana issues at all unless something bad happens such as double pull, bad CC or just people being morons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm healing is supposed to be more difficult and thinking about what you're doing + not being afraid of using your CDs, however it's still supposed to be possible to do a heroic within (in my opinion) an hour, not three.<br />
<br />
All healers are struggling on Mana, that's the intent. Paladins were apparently not having this problem like everyone else was, so they nerfed you in line with everyone else. Blizz wants healer mana to be an issue. They want to force DPS and tank to avoid what they can, and healers to choose the right spells for the job. It's &quot;working as intended&quot; if the DPS who keeps standing in fire is dead a the end of the fight. It's also &quot;working as intended&quot; if most DPS spent most of the fight at 50% health, had to burn survivability cooldowns and/or self heal if possible. My friends Anti-magic Shell, Icebound Fortitude, and Gift of the Nauru have been getting quite the workout in heroics.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't really fix the problem. This just makes holy palas rather useless. The issue was: LoD was OP as aoe heal, LoD healed tank too. Holy light is infact a very bad spell, long cast time + low healing. The only good part of holy light was the holy power generation, since you could LoD and heal fuckloads(or WoG if specced for WoG rather). The better nerf would've been to change it so LoD no longer heals the tank(therefore forcing hpalas to either use LoD healing raid or WoG healing tank and 1 other person). Possibly make judgement not procc seal of insight. Now I think my new healing style will be to use Divine light instead of Holy light and rather wait 1-2 sec between each cast... At least that way I'll have some HP regen and similar hps and mana usage...</div></div><hr />

Because this is an RPG, and being different / special / unique makes your character more yours and less exactly the same as everyone else.<br />
<br />
The stat bonuses are required for all professions now. If there isn't some kind of stat bonus, no matter how it's implemented, the profession is automatically worse than everything else. This is the reason the engineering tinkers got nerfed but the cogs and helm were introduced.<br />
<br />
In light of the stat bonuses being bland and required the only remaining 'difference' of any real value between professions (what you can make for other people is meaningless) is the BoP items. This mount was one of those; now it's just a gold sink.<br />
<br />
The remaining 'unique' things for professions are:<br />
* The flying carpets for tailoring<br />
* The flying machines for engineering<br />
* The tinkers for engineering<br />
* The alchemist stone for alchemy<br />
<br />

There are some JC-only trinkets. I'm just not understanding how this had any &quot;real value&quot; for Alchemists. It's just a mount.</div></div><hr />

They probably switched to different gear/used a transform item for the pic. I guess they could've fought as Blood Elves (I've fought as a Wolvar before), but for the gear it's probably their &quot;pic&quot; set.</div></div><hr />
