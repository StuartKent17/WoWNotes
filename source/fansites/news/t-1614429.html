Because they would rather get music for the masses than some guy pressing buttons that 6 people in the crowd care about.</div></div><hr />

To be fair people don't go to BlizzCon to see metallica, it is a cool bonus but it isn't why people go so I wouldn't expect people to drop everything and attend a concert if they already had plans.</div></div><hr />

No I get that, which is why I say it's a shame. Changed my mind from maybe buying the virtual ticket package to definitely doing it.</div></div><hr />

Why should he be jealous? Metallica makes some good songs, but the bandmembers are assholes. There are tons of better bands out there.<br />

bad choice lol.<br />
<br />
From what i have seen on twitch and live pvp/raid streams most gamers nowadays are into electronicish/dubstepsih type of music..you could even get those bands that mix metal with that, but a full trash metal band from the 70s/80s ..cmon now...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Too commerical? Most of their songs were made 20-30 years ago. Unless people are still stuck on One getting a music video...<br />
<br />
Also, Foo fighters are the epitome of a great rock band with awesome dudes in their lineup. I don't know how anyone could hate on them. Dave Grohl is a man's man.</div></div><hr />

Metallica is THRASH, not Heavy Metal. Actually, they created the Thrash genre. It is thanks to them we have bands like Megadeath and the like.<br />
<br />
Heavy Metal is......way more hardcore.</div></div><hr />

AS I said:<br />
<br />
Metallica is considered Thrash Metal, not Heavy Metal.<br />
<br />
Different Genre. Personally I prefer Thrash over Heavy, because sometimes Heavy gets a little TOO hardcore.</div></div><hr />

It is literally thanks to Metallica that we have Megadeth. If they hadn't kicked Dave Mustaine out of Metallica we wouldn't have Megadeth.<br />

Megadeth is still better though. So much heavier and faster.</div></div><hr />

Oh woow. I don't really like metallica because it's way too commercial, but it's better than what the other years had I think(like Foo fighters).<br />
<br />
If Metallica is way too commercial, da fuq is Foo Fighters then? o.O</div></div><hr />

Megadeth is still better though. So much heavier and faster.<br />
<br />
Oh I'll never deny that awesomeness that is Megadeth. And yes, you are absolutely correct. Kicking out Mustaine was both their worst move..and best move. If they had not we wouldn't have Megadeth, so they created their main competition. But...by kicking him out they also helped in the creation of an awesome band.<br />
<br />
But I enjoy both bands. To me, though, Metallica is special. Love em or hate em, you still need to respect them because they completely changed Metal (their personal views aside. I'm talking about what they did for the genre not all the stuff they do offstage). All of the Thrash bands today are following in their footsteps.</div></div><hr />

From what i have seen on twitch and live pvp/raid streams most gamers nowadays are into electronicish/dubstepsih type of music..you could even get those bands that mix metal with that, but a full trash metal band from the 70s/80s ..cmon now...<br />
<br />
They weren't around in he 70's. Also, this is what Blizzard themselves likes, which is neat honestly, they can't always cater to the fans.<br />

I like both Metallica's and Blizzard's products, but they both piss me off for reasons that are probably summed up pretty well by the quote.<br />
<br />
All said, I think they're an alright choice. Someone might have nailed it by talking about middle aged people picking bands... but they are also pretty well tolerated by a decent number of people. Vanilla is a good choice for a diverse crowd.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Metallica by Request&quot;<br />

Basically, everyone with a Rock am Ring Ticket was allowed to vote on their site and they would play the songs that where voted the most + their newest Song (Lords of Summer)<br />
<br />
On the day they would play there was a video playing every 2 minutes when there was no band on stage that said that 3 songs tied and you should send SMS for 50 Cent per SMS to vote for the last song.<br />

The three songs that &quot;tied&quot; where &quot;The Day that never comes&quot;, &quot;...And Justice for all&quot; and another Song no one in their right mind would want to vote for. <br />

I was a big Metallica fan like... back in the late 80's but I just can't stand their personalities; and as someone who mostly grew up on Punk/Hardcore in small venues and met/hung out with/talked to a lot of my favorite bands.

Absurd amount of money? It's only $40. You're getting a concert, info on what's coming next in games and content, tournament coverage and live raid competition (if any of that applies to you), and minor in game content for 3 or 4 different titles. I'd say $40 is a steal considering what you might pay for a concert alone on pay-per-view or actual tickets, or what Blizz may have charged for the in-game stuff if it were put on the Cash Shop.</div></div><hr />

Uhm, is anyone really going to argue that this isn't a huge step-up? Even if you don't like Metallica, they still have millions of fans and still sells out concerts around the world. Blink-182 on the other hand, no one even knew still existed. The &quot;too commercial/Foo Fighters&quot; comment I found hilarious, who honestly doesn't listen to a band because it's too popular? If you like it you like it, and if you don't you don't. Nothing else matters. (Pun intended)<br />
<br />
Say what you want about Metallica. They practically invent multiple genres, and many bands today wouldn't exist if it wasn't for them. This includes an insane amount of &quot;non-commercial indie&quot; bands that many people listen to nowadays.</div></div><hr />

Well, you said &quot;and another Song no one in their right mind would want to vote for&quot;. Well, maybe people like it and did vote for it? You must consider the possibility that you could be an outlier.<br />
<br />
<br />
How clueless are you? noone cares for Metallica anymore since they went for napster cause theyre to stupid and go against their own fans.I gues you havent heard the SHIT metallica put out after ...and justice for all???You cant admit your FAIL can you? he is NAMED after the AIRBASE RAMSTEIN not fater the band. You must be seriously desperate :DI fixed that for you. Hell even that metallica movie was a piece of crap cause instead of just showing the concert the tried to make it a REAL movie with &quot;STORY&quot;.<br />

&quot;I don't like Metallica therefore they are insignificant and anything they do sucks&quot;.<br />

&quot;Where&quot; (wait...where do you want me to look? OH, you meant &quot;were&quot;) and yet they recently had their largest grossing tour ever. That is the definition of still is, not were.<br />
<br />
&quot;Shit&quot; after And Justice For All? The shit started with Load. All albums up until Load and ReLoad were great.<br />
<br />
They went after Napster, and it was actually legitimate. If you work for something, you don't want people getting it for free. They don't perform/make albums for the fans. They do it to make money. And any band that says otherwise is lying, else they would be performing for free. I find it funny that people go after them for that when it was mainly a single member (Lars) and he had a valid point (people were getting his music for free. Basically: stealing). They just went about it all the wrong WAY.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't waste my money for any college music classes because they're for mouth-breathers who have no actual skillsets and want to spend their whole lives chasing an unreachable dream.

I don't think one can generalise that gamers nowdays are into anything in particular. This is especially true when we're talking about World of Warcraft players; MMOs have a very, very wide demographic - WoW especially. But yeah, there is basically nothing that Blizzard could pick that would please all the attendees. Even among the very traditional gamer demographic I don't think there would even be a consensus. (as a gamer, I like just about every music genre)<br />
<br />
It's mildly amusing to me that every year, people decry the choice as the worst pick ever, and that they should have picked band X instead, like there is one right choice that will make everyone happy.<br />
<br />
Personally, as someone who has always attended Blizzcon, I have enjoyed most of the concerts -- Tenacious D is not my style and would be the one exception -- but oddly my favourite still remains Video Games Live. I am pretty sure if Blizzard scrapped a rock band for VGL people would throw a shitfit, too. Can't win!<br />
<br />
I haven't listened to Metallica in 15+ years, but I am sure they will put on a good show. And if not, well, no one is there for the band anyway.</div></div><hr />

Perfectly said. It's astounding that people get so....upset over musical tastes. If you don't like the band, at least give more of a reason than &quot;they suck&quot; or don't say anything at all. Basically it just sounds like most of these posts are here just stir the pot.<br />

<br />
I'm a fan of rock and metal since I was 8. I like a lot of metal bands like Helloween, Iron Maiden, Gamma Ray, Therion, Tristania, Iced Earth, Blind Guardian, Dimmu Borgir and many others. But not metallica. They always sounded way too commercial(and they took a commercial route) and for that reason I didn't like it.<br />
<br />
So there, you just met someone who doesn't like metallica :)</div></div><hr />

Getting mixed signals here, guys. Look, I know you want to complain, but please at least pick a tact and stick to it. <br />
<br />
Pro-tip - it's difficult to be both &quot;heavy metal&quot; and &quot;whiny emo bullshit&quot; at the same time. The fact is, they're neither. They're metal/thrash metal. I strongly advise KoolKid to research into actual heavy metal, and quikbunny to grow up and realise that just because they're a group he doesn't like, doesn't magically make them emo.</div></div><hr />

Except Metallica play with positivity, they're one of the only of the thrash metal genre that give positive vibes live. Their live shows are like celebrations, they're there to have fun along with the crowd, never mind the lyrics. Next time try talking about something you actually know something about, Metallica is anything but whiny.<br />

Technically, Heavy Metal is a genre of Rock. It began with what I call 'The Big Three'.... Sabbath, Zeppelin and Deep Purple, and was more blues.<br />
<br />
Then Judas Priest came and decided that was just no good, which is where the speed comes from. <br />
<br />
Definitely agree on the Heavy Metal and Thrash metal for Metallica, you CAN be in two genres at once.</div></div><hr />

It's so you're able to hit the bass pedal twice as much when you're trying to get a constant flow of bass pedal beats, but it becomes awful when shit drummers such as metallica's and megadeth's just hit their double bass pedals constantly throughout their entire song.

He doesn't conform to the EDM music these days (SNL about dropping the bass amirite?). He does produce quality good music. <br />

Regardless if he presses a button or not, he spent hours upon hours creating it, just as talented as somebody who plays live, he has done his work.<br />

Actually both their drummers are considered god like drummers by nearly every musical figure on earth. You really are trying too hard with this. Metallica is one of the top 30 highest selling bands to ever play on this earth with over 110 million record sales. Lars Ulrich is on every best drummers ever list created from Gibson to Rolling Stone. <br />

wish they'd get someone whose glory days aren't long past.<br />
<br />
I'd dare say Metallica = one of the bigs to many MANY people, no matter how wrong they've gone during recent times no doubt due to a shitty music industry. No such thing as glory days being gone when classics.<br />
<br />
Seriously, I'd take them or old geezers from most 70's bands over the crap we have these days. Inb4 &quot;Nicki Minaj will be performing at Blizzcon 2015!&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See, this is where you go wrong. It's fine to dislike a band or a type of music, but claiming it's not &quot;real&quot; music just because you don't like it is the very height of ignorance and stupidity.</div></div><hr />

That avatar doesn't go with this whole attempt at &quot;Holier than thou&quot;. Also, I'd call it the pinnacle of trolling to claim that music ain't real for a fact just because YOU don't like it. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

MMO Champion is like the filth gaming forum of the internet where most of the trash comes. Every where else i've read up on Metallica at Blizzcon the comments is largely positive and happy/excited..Then a person comes over here and it's the same old bitch and complain..The only forum on the internet that's bitching..Didn't see that coming. This place actually gives me a headache at times like this morning..No idea how people can go on all day/everyday bitching at everything, living in some whining state of mind on everything in life. Metallica is a decent choice...Much worse ones out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But since I am curious, since you believe they suck, what band would you chose instead?<br />
<br />
Haha. What a stale retort! I'd probably choose a washed up band from the 80s and 90s ironically, like Metallica. ;)</div></div><hr />

i'd consider glory days to be when they're making good music. their new music is complete crap compared to their old stuff, which is legendary tier.<br />
<br />
if they could get metallica, they could get testament, or exodus, or even a newer band like lazarus A.D.</div></div><hr />

Ouch, what a &quot;Whiplash&quot;. Please, &quot;Shoot Me Again&quot;. &quot;So What&quot;, like I'm supposed to be all butthurt by the biggest troll here. And you'll just keep at it &quot;Until It Sleeps&quot;, won't you? Well, here's your &quot;Cure&quot;, &quot;King Nothing&quot;. I won't be &quot;Wasting My Hate&quot; on you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm gonna assume those are some stupid names of songs by that sellout of a band called metallica? <br />
1/10 for creativity.<br />
