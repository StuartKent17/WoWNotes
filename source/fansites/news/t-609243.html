<br />
Q&amp;A Grab Bag<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Sunwell Plateau is the last content patch before the expansion release.<br />
There isn't any plan to nerf Kil'jaeden right now, he's intended to be the last boss before the expansion and is meant to be hard. <br />
Raiding armor sets and PvP rewards sets will look different and won't share the same model anymore in Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
Uldum was on the original list of dungeons to be added to Wrath of the Lich King but right now it's still unsure if we'll see it or not. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Raiding armor sets and PvP rewards sets will look different and won't share the same model anymore in Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Mechanics<br />
Most of the shaman totems, Unleashed Rage, and Battle Shout are some of the buffs changed in WotLK to affect the whole raid instead of the party. <br />
Dynamic Line of Sight will be introduced in WotLK PvP, for exemple a pillar might move up and down every 20 seconds, or we might have movable items. More info about Arenas in tomorrow's panel.<br />
The attacker/target range mechanics are being re-evaluated it might be changed for Wrath of the Lich King to fix most of the existing bugs, including the ones affecting the attack range of Feral Druids. <br />
Even if it looks like a lot of classes are being changed to make them &quot;more hybrid&quot;, but developers still want to keep the classes as distinct as possible. <br />
There is a plan to give player access to two talent specs to switch between them without having to respec all the time. More details in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World<br />
You will be able to use your flying mount again at level 77, and might be able to take passengers at level 80. <br />
A harbor will be added to Stormwind to transport players to Northrend, a new zone will be added in Northern Plaguelands as the Death Knight starting area, and an arena will be added to Orgrimmar in place of the existing empty one.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Inscription trading skill is intended to be for both casters and melees, inscriptions benefits every class. The current plan is to use herbalism as the primary gathering profession. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Death Knight<br />
People playing a Death Knights will see the original voice of their race slightly modified to make it sound more ... Death Knight-ish. <br />
Tanks will be interchangeable in 5-man dungeons but tanks will have a speciality in 25-man raids. Death Knights will be best against casters and shouldn't be too far behind on other encounters.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
Dagger specialization will be improved for rogues in Wrath of the Lich King. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock<br />
There isn't any plan to change the soul shard farming as it's part of the class, but an &quot;emergency soul shard&quot; ability might be added.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid<br />
There will be a new model for the Druid's Dire Bear form and the Dire Cat form will be introduced.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin<br />
Retribution paladins will share their itemization with Death Knights and Warriors. Their group utility will be increased by making them more efficient DPS-wise. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior<br />
The plan is to improve the warrior specs to make sure that DPS warriors would be able to tank a little, while protection warriors would be able to DPS slightly more with new abilities like Shockwave.<br />
<br />

<br />
I would hope that a dps warrior would eventually get a CC since its kinda required in a lot of cases, since we can't off-tank a mob in heroic.<br />
<br />
And I hope they are true to their word and realizing that the tanking classes are few and far between with the tankadin being the best right now, which is good, but would love to spread the love.<br />
<br />
I am SUPER excited about the Death Grip, I always wanted a Scorpion pull ability as a warrior tank.</div></div><hr />

Nourish: &quot;Heals a friendly target for 1550 to 1800. Heals for an additional 387.5 to 450 if Rejuvenation is on the target.&quot; <br />
Flourish (Rank 1) (talent) - 450 mana, 40 yard range. &quot;Heals friendly party or raid members within 10 yards of the target for 672 over 7 sec. The amount healed is applied quickly at first, and slows down as the Flourish reaches its full duration.&quot; &quot;<br />
<br />
MY bad I didn't realize they were thinking about two healing spells.</div></div><hr />

Does this mean that the 2H will become Main hand? and you'll be allowed a off-hand? or actually be able to equip 2x2H? is this been revealeD?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Bladestorm is indeed Arms.<br />
Titan's Grip is indeed fury.<br />
<br />
Think about it, Titan's Grip is about dual wielding, which is fury.<br />
<br />
According to Lead Designer, THIS does indeed mean dual wielding 2x2hD weapons.* SICK imo!!<br />
<br />
But it does reduce your damage from the weapon. *not mentioned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Congratulations, here's your frostfire bolt, it's crap, but it sounds very powerfull!&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The new mage armor is very powerful, they also changed invis to a 3 second phase time (can be reduced to 1 second with the talent prismatic cloak) and they changed magic absorption to grant .2 to all resists per point (5 points total) per level (thats 120 resists at level 80, thats like having a felhunter with master demo) and they also added a new shield which absorbs 1200-2000 damage then freezes all opponents nearby for 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
Im a mage and those are some amazing changes TBQH<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: FYI titan grip makes you attack 20% slower with 5 points vested.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Laotzu</div><div class="date">2008-06-28, 12:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Frostfire bolt will benefit from both fire and frost talents. It will do damage based on which element the target is most vulnerable too.<br />
<br />
So it will slow the target, freeze them in place etc as well as benefit from ignite and so on depending on which talents you have picked up in the 2 trees.</div></div><hr />

So it will slow the target, freeze them in place etc as well as benefit from ignite and so on depending on which talents you have picked up in the 2 trees. <br />
<br />
<br />
If you looked at the tooltip it also said 40(or 46) yard range, if you can enhance that with talents then its a big advantage over the shorter range frostbolt (36 yards)</div></div><hr />

<br />
he just described the reasons behind the DK inspiration/design, and that they are making the DK talent trees be less of one role each (DPS,tanking or utility) and more mixed to allow for more tanks in the game<br />
<br />
the UI around the character portrait has been changed and simplified, but I haven't seen it because at that point the stream went haywire :'(</div></div><hr />

The changes around seem to boost everything but mages dps...<br />
As i spent last months getting all classes to lvl 70 (but warr and druid that i don't like) i guess i'm definely moving to the no-brainer gameplay of Hunters or Rogue/Lock as dps.<br />

The Mage Armor change is good in a way. It's still so limited in its use though. I guess when you go into arena and you notice if its Warrior/Druid or Warlock/Druid you'd swap but that's mana cost right there against a drain team... nice.</div></div><hr />

I believe that the note means that Long-term buffs (Blessing of Might, Wisdom, Salvation etc) will no-longer be overwritten by short-term buffs such as Blessing of Freedom, Protection and Sacrifice. Good change, but it will be interesting to see if they remove the 'one Blessing per Paladin' rule too in Wrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He said Freedom and Protection would no longer be considered blessings so will not over-write an existing blessing when used on a target.<br />
<br />
So if you have cast Blessings of Kings on the tank and you use Freedom on him - he will no longer lose BoK. They are going to rename BoF and BoP so they arent blessings anymore. Thats all he said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mages will be getting alot more (PvE) buffs than what they've said so far on the panel, talents which for example increase your crit% alot, talents that boost spirit and critchance based on your spirit (very useful considering how much stronger spirit actually will be as a stat in general), increased critical damage bonus for fire, free instant-casts for arcane, a huge boost in AoE damage for fire, much stronger kitingstrength for frost, but also a very strong frostbolt buff (damage and a debuff that benefits the entire raid, but also boosts your own DPS alot).<br />
<br />
So really no .. the changes I've seen for mages so far, bring mages right back on top of the DPS-meters. So you shouldn't start whining .. yet. (You should probably also note that warlocks for example have been given almost 0 talent that increase their raidDPS, but mostly just utility and fancy solo/5man talents).</div></div><hr />

Like Haq said, its great for healing classes and tanks who want to DPS in PvP and actually KILL things. Will be loving it for my warrior tank. Also quite sexy for my lock if I ever want to play SL/SL spec when I'm bored of farming stuff.</div></div><hr />

and omg these changes sound awseome..i can't wait for them all... makes me wish i had a 70 of every class... and demonform o_0 i knew it was gonna be the final demo talent, sounds sweet.. hope its just like the wc3 demonhunter(illidan)<br />
<br />
dire cat form^.^ and frostfire bolt sounds sweet, a dualtype dmg spell that gets effected from both talent schools...<br />

I play all of my chars in PvP and PvE (doing only one is rather boring to me). These are a 9/5/47 destruction warlock, a 20/41/0 CoH holy priest, a 42/0/19 mutilate rogue and a 45/11/5 beastmaster hunter. I also started a protection paladin.<br />
Yes in my opinion all of them are viable in both PvP and PvE but i guess you would disagree about some.<br />
<br />
For me the point in creating and leveling a character is to make decissions and balance out my various individual interestes. Yes i really like the fact that i can't have the perfect raidspec and the perfect arena spec all at once. The necessity to deal with the disadvantages of my choosen spec is what makes it fun for me.<br />
<br />
If my warlock could switch between SL/SL and 0/21/40 all the time there would be no point in playing him at all.</div></div><hr />

I look like a what? The stats aren't gonna make up for the suckage. One reason I liked fury was I hated the 3sec speeds on 2handers. Now I'll get to DW them, only with a 4-5sec speed, woohoo.

FAIL !!!<br />
2 damage over 2 seconds = 1 DPS...<br />
<br />
Now some maths with new S4 weapons (Maces).<br />
2H mace : 140.3 DPS<br />
1H mace : 107.9 DPS (mainhand) or 108.0 DPS (offhand)<br />
<br />
2H mace - 20% (maxed out talent) = 112.24 DPS<br />
<br />
112.24 DPS &gt; 107.9 DPS or 108 DPS<br />
+ 4.02% on Main Hand.<br />
+ 3.93% on Offhand<br />
<br />
The extra stats will increase the +% Dps even more. <br />
(and with raid buffs the difference spreads even more)<br />
<br />
Still, honestly...landing a hit every 4.3 - 4.5 seconds for a fury warrior might be quite depressing and totaly destroy your dps on squishy stuff (5 men heroics or similar) that die before you land your second hit...</div></div><hr />

This is for PvE though, what they do with PVP I really don't care it's a whole different world.<br />
<br />
They should introduce spells that work/act/behave completely differently in PvP and PvE, this would eliminate constant imbalances between the two mentioned sectors and if they want to tweak something in PvP they would not mess up the spell in PvE and vice versa. Every class can be balanced perfectly with only one path (pvp or pve) in mind, if you try to do it in with both, you end up with a mess that is now, where classes that should clearly do a better job don't and then they try to balance all this by trying to give all classes the same spells with a different name, leading to even less diversity and fun.</div></div><hr />

Actually.. you're an idiot. Hex makes them unable to attack or cast spells for 8 seconds while NOT breaking on damage and letting them move at -75% speed. So it's like poly without breaking on damage and no healing effect. Not the same at all.</div></div><hr />

Whooptie doo...<br />
<br />
These 3 things we have been asking for prior to BC.<br />
<br />
These three things should have been done with release 1.9 (that was the one they looked at paladins in)<br />
<br />
So while I am truly happy they are adding exciting things for all the other classes.<br />
<br />
Got to say, not going to be playing in expansion, given their continued need to &quot;curb kick&quot; paladins.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ninthelora</div><div class="date">2008-06-30, 06:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Allright I read all this 10 pages every single post and I liked all the discussion there :) I could agree with a lot but disagree in some matters aswell.<br />
<br />
About the classes, @ first: it is way to early to yell about, my class is being nerfed. There aint being officially announced which class get which spells. Only talenttrees are revealed which is only about 20% of your capabilities. Im wanting to hear all whining mages when they announce something like: Firelance (Rank 1) - Does 478 to 526 damage to the target. Does triple damage against targets with a scorch debuff on them... for example.<br />
<br />
So just hush and wait. All classes will be fun to play @ the start, im sure of it and in meantime ofcourse there will be patches to rebalance it.<br />
<br />
About the warriors using 2x2H, its probably just going to be a personal choice you got to make and the fact that it will do loads of damage when you hit a target. But it is very slow. So for 5man instances it aint so good.<br />
<br />
The thing what made me most happy, seems to some of you guys being a fail by blizz. Im talking about the ability to have 2 setted specs which you can switch off (anytime or with CD (I hope anytime personally)).<br />
I have a rogue and im not a rich rogue lets say most of the time I got around 200g on my bank. I come back from work go eat and can play @ 19.00 mostly. Im not in the mood to do daily's. I play the game for fun (what it should be). So I want to do some BG's and do some heroics/swift kara run or w/e. Now I want to do heroics with combat spec for sure. Top the damage is what we want right? And in pvp I want Shs! So switching between 2 specs is for me something I could say about: Why didnt they do this earlier?!<br />
And actually I must not complain... For tanks/healing classes this is even beter!<br />
<br />
This is my honest opinion, just wait before you scream about nerfs to your class!<br />
WOTLK is gonna be so much fun!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting times ahead for WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fury Warriors - My main is Fury, but when I heard about the Titan Grip thing I rolled my eyes. It might look really cool, but unless they completely redo how Rage works again..it won't be very efficient in raid dps. That, and it does sound more like a personal choice and will probably balance itself out. So hit really slow and do x amount of damage with less hits, or hit in normal speed with more attacks and do the same amount of damage. Meh, I am not really a fan of Titan Grip myself, but to each their own.<br />
<br />
Dual Spec - This will be a great boost to individuals who like to tank/dps, tank/pvp, dps/pvp, heal/dps, heal/pvp, etc. It will also be a boost within a raid itself if you tend to have a raid with like 4 or 5 tank spec'd people..then you are against a boss that only needs a single tank. Currently you have 4 semi-useless dps wasting raid space, but if this thing happens, your other tanks can all switch to their dps or pvp spec and actually do dps.<br />
<br />
Totems - THANK YOU JEBUS! Sometimes raids are able to select perfect class balances for themselves, but others aren't all as lucky to have multiple Enhancement Shamans or whatever spec in the raid. So if you end up having 4 or 5 tanks, and an entire group of melee, but only 1 Enhancement Shaman, it can suck. But if this goes through, all your tanks get Windfury to up their threat a little bit more (think Void Reaver), and even the Feral Druids get benefits since Strength of Earth and Grace of Air will be combined..so no more needing to choose between agility for druids/hunters, or windfury for rogues/warriors. But also I guess Windfury will help Druids attack faster, so they will also get Windfury while we also get more agility for crit or AP or whatever we use it for.<br />
<br />
Druids - Nice changes, but Feral definitely needs a buff by way of gear choices. They don't have that big of a selection currently..it's either get PvP gear, set pieces, badge gear, or you are boned. Rogues at least get regular drops from bosses.</div></div><hr />

Seems like heroism and aoe healing will be the 2 key things that will make raiders need more then 1 but I'd imagion there might be less in the future.</div></div><hr />

I was expecting new things for the whole hunter gameplay but now we got slight changes to our shooting rotations (meaning we dont need them that much anymore..) and buff to our pets for pvp, I somewhat doubt that these things will change us that much in pve because everyone would yell OP to our faces even more..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paranitis</div><div class="date">2008-07-02, 01:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I also really like the Hunter change as far as pet talent trees go. I can finally turn my Hunter's Crab into an actual tank! Yay!</div></div><hr />

<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">timzor</div><div class="date">2008-07-02, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">oh yeah<br />
<br />
add all melee dmg enhancing buffs and an full wotlk haste gear 2 that</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarevokcz</div><div class="date">2008-07-03, 08:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Totems are being &quot;condensed&quot; into a smaller amount of totems, for exemple Strength of Earth and Grace of Air totems will be merged into the same totem<br />
A new weapon enchantment will be available &quot;Earthliving Weapon&quot;. It will increase the healing power of the Shaman.<br />
Flametongue will give spell damage bonus to the Shaman.<br />
Totems are being moved to physical school, you can't counterspell anymore. <br />
Totems will also affect raid members, not just the local party.<br />
Shamans are getting &quot;Hex&quot;, a polymorph-like spell on a medium cooldown allowing them to turn an enemy into a frog. The enemy cannot cast or attack but is still in control of his character.<br />
Windfury won't be a weapon enchant anymore and will be changed to a buff. You will be able to use it in bear form or with poison.<br />
<br />
<br />
holy cow!<br />
if thats gonna come in wotlk, im going to play once again WoW, those are really my wishes from last year n half in tBC, little bit late, but that might really help shaman both pve and pvp wise, tho raid-wide totems could be in current form OP, i guess they can have only 1 raid-wide totem and 3 other elements only party wide or smth like that, still, nice plans for shaman, finally, they deserve that after tBC tbh</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">phoenix_crow</div><div class="date">2008-07-11, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You guys seem to forget that totems only have a 20 yard range (30 with talents if I remember correctly). There are a lot of fights where everyone just can't be that close to the totems, gruul for instance. Even with the totems buffing all of the raid you will still need more then one or two to cover the entire raid. <br />
One problem I see coming about this change is the tranquil totem, I would often be put into a group of healers and would have to make sure this was put down all the time. But now I'm going to have to make sure it's out of range of the tank and the OT as well as having it down all the time. <br />
<br />
In the future I see lots of uninformed people yelling at me wondering why they don't have my totem buffs when I'm trying to buff other other people. And me running back and forth trying to buff both magic and melee (good luck on getting your buffs hunters), I hope to god they also add more time before the totems go away.<br />
<br />
Other then that I like the changes. Hex seems like it's going to be great, but more as a &quot;oh shit&quot; move. We still won't be a viable CC in instances or raids but that's ok by me. Hopefully it won't be a nature move but I'm sure it will be. Changes to weapon enhancements should have been around a long time ago. <br />
<br />
What Shaman really need is different kinds of attacks, having nothing but nature moves puts a dampen on our ability to fight anything that can lock it down. Druid are in the same boat but less so.</div></div><hr />
