A word from Mekon &amp; Mackzter (SK Guild Leaders)<br />
First of all we would like to say a huge thanks to the guild for all the work that has been put in not only now but the during the build up to Sunwell in general. It's been an intense 4 days of raiding but now it's time to return to normal working life for the next few months and relax :)<br />
<br />
As for Kil'Jaeden: It's a really intense fight, the most technically demanding fight in terms of personal performance and survivability. M'uru was all about the strategy and this one was all about absolute perfection in terms of execution. There are however a few random elements that make the fight frustrating at times. All in all definitely the hardest boss ever made and an impressive final boss.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has finally done a good job on a TBC instance with Sunwell. The difficulty level compared to BT is not even comparable it's soo much harder. In BT you could have 5 bad players and still carry them no problem, Sunwell requries consistent perfection. We are soo happy that they have finally delivered a non cockblocked but very hard instance!.<br />
<br />
As for WOTLK we are going to go just as hard, probably recruit more players to prepare and hopefully we will be playing the Beta soon :) Now we've proved we are the best we have no intention of giving up that mantle without a fight!<br />

/e seems as if i was wrong thinking blizz hadn't finished the encounter^^, thought the AE+500% damage increase for the last 10% would be meant to make him unkillable...<br />

<br />
Are you serious? oO. They raided at least 10 hours the day. Most other guilds will need 3 weeks of training (with normal raidtimes) to kill him - if they ever pass M'uru.<br />
<br />
There are two reasons why first kills took longer in the past:<br />
1. There wasn't any guilds, that raid 10+ hours a day<br />
2. In classic you had to farm 1 hour for the potions for 1 hour raiding<br />
<br />
It is a wonder, that people have the ambition to wipe 50 hours on one boss. There are many games that I bought, I never even played for 50 hours.</div></div><hr />

and if they spent 10 hours raiding so what? u think they are the only ones? they killed him first and they deserve recognition for it, so here goes GRATS <br />
<br />
btw...u dont happend to be a nihilum lover? =)</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">flammable</div><div class="date">2008-05-25, 01:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A huge congratulations to SK Gaming. They have proven since the start of Sunwell that they are indeed THE BEST guild in the world and it is even more impressive that they got world first before the US, who had 1 more day headstart than they did.<br />
<br />
Nihilum were quite confident that they would get KJ world first kill, but now, obviously not. Nihilum's bold claim's before their world first twins added to the competitive edge of raiding and makes it only more interesting for all observers and rival guilds.<br />
<br />
About previous claims regarding the encounter being too easy. I do agree that it is unfortunate that he was able to be killed within 5 days but the top guilds demand perfection and they have vasts amount of players who will fill this role through realm transfers... its a pity now that the top guilds seem to always retain their position with new cross realm recruits... its pretty impossible now for new guilds to make a name for themselves and realms don't really have the same community as in the past. Players can easily just go to another realm.<br />
<br />
Anyway congrats to SK once against and they are crowned the best raiders in all of World of Warcraft, for the next 6 months(?) at least =D...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It took SK less time to do KJ than M'uru?. However SK have said that KJ is the hardest boss yet?.<br />
<br />
It has to be noted however that M'uru is mentioned in the KJ kill statement, but im sure you guys have been working around the clock to acheive this so well done.<br />
<br />
I for one am iterested in SK's thoughts on the tuning of SWP. M'uru give me nightmares but as KJ has been KO'd faster it gives me hope.</div></div><hr />

Most casual raiders likely put in about the same amount of time once totaled. These top guilds simply make the big pushes when it counts and have the skilled players for those times.</div></div><hr />

Somehow this race felt kinda akin to whats going on in america right now, with Nihilum keep moving the goalpost and insiting that &quot;that boss doesnt matter&quot;, &quot;we couldnt do this and that, so their kill doesnt count&quot;, &quot;only the last boss is what gives world firsts&quot;, &quot;they got to test it on ptr, but we didnt, so no way we can get world first&quot;, blablabla. <br />
<br />
So nice to see them finally put back in their place, hopefully this will also mean that they will shape up and we will see a more serious and competitive race going on in WOTLK, if there will be any race at all...(due to blizzards idiotic changes imo)<br />
<br />
But one question to the guys that were actually there; since KJ was never tested, how polished did the fight feel? Buggy, too easy (i know you wrote hardest, but a boss can be hard as hell and still be easy once youve figured it out), or overtuned? Did he feel like an untuned boss?</div></div><hr />

our mages have always delivered on dps (2700dps last teron for example) and this would never be a reason not to bench them.<br />

in terms of raiding hours i dont really know why ppl whine at playing a few heavy progress raids. We raided BT/Hyjal in 4.5 hours for 11 months we've had plenty of free time to do whatever (infact im sure some of our raiders play less than most casuals on an average week). ppl dont mind sacrificing a couple of days of work or classes to get a world first, feels amazing trust me :)<br />

Raiding started to go sour with TBC, with the crappy content, server migrations, watered down PVP and whatnot.<br />
Guilds used to be a sacred thing, there were bonds of friendship between members. Loyalty and character meant a lot, now with server migrations no one cares about such trivia, time for the prosperity of guild hoppers and loot whores.<br />
Top guilds pre tbc had a status of a legend and had a shadow of mistery veiling them, right now they are a machine for recruiting top tier geared players, nothing misterius or legendary about that.<br />
<br />
Sorry about the rant. I spent a lot of time playing this game, made a lot of friends, too bad it all turned in to a money making machine.</div></div><hr />

Also SK raided twice the hours nihilum did, all this being said Nihilum still managed to pull out the world 3rd on KJ so i still consider them #1</div></div><hr />
