Mists of Pandaria Digital Deluxe Mount and Pet Released<br />
If you bought the Digital Deluxe (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/services/digital-deluxe/) version of Mists of Pandaria you should receive your mount (http://www.wowdb.com/items/85870-imperial-quilen), pet (http://www.wowdb.com/items/85871-lucky-quilen-cub), and achievements (http://www.wowdb.com/search?search=quilen+collector#t1:achievements) when logging in after Patch 5.0.4. <br />

Gamescom Interviews<br />
There are few more interviews from Gamescom that have some interesting bits of information. If you want to read the entire interview, check out Millenium (http://www.millenium.org/wow/accueil/actualites/mop-interview-des-developpeurs-de-wow-entretien-de-millenium-avec-les-devs-de-wow-73403) and Judgehype (http://worldofwarcraft.judgehype.com/news/mop-patch-5-0-world-boss-ordalie-quete-legendaire-patch-5-1-etc/).<br />
<br />
<br />
The Sha of Anger (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1265-Sha-of-Anger-Pandaria) respawns every two hours and will drop PvP and PvE gear, similar to Tol Barad bosses. You should be able to do this boss once a week.<br />
Salyis's Warband (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/710-Salyis-s-Warband-Pandaria) will only respawn once every four to five days and drop items you can't find anywhere else such as mounts and pets. <br />
Proving Grounds (solo instances to try out new specs, train yourself and earn achievements) are not forgotten, just something that has to be done right. There is no specific announcement date yet, but it is something they might come back to after Mists of Pandaria is released.<br />
Playing with lower level friends is something that would still be nice to do, and part of the tech needed was added with challenge modes. This is not a high priority for the moment, so there is no specific announcement to be made about it.<br />
The goal for Mists of Pandaria is to deliver the next major content patch right as players are finishing up the first one. They should be spaced out more evenly with a shorter time between patches, maybe even a little more content than in previous expansion patches. <br />
There are no current plans for a system of veteran's rewards for older players. <br />
Mists of Pandaria won't be bringing back any old bosses.<br />
There won't be any server merges, as cross-realm zone technology will be applied to the problem. <br />
The legendary questline will start in Patch 5.0 with Wrathion who traveled to Pandaria. After completing the questlines, you will be rewarded with a powerful gem that will let you upgrade specific items dropped from raid bosses. The questline will not finish here and will continue with Patch 5.1, after the Horde and Alliance really settle in Pandaria. The questline available after the release of Mists of Pandaria will end with a cliffhanger.<br />
PvP/Arena spectator mode is a functionality that developers would like to add but no real plan for now.<br />
Pet Battles could be available on mobile platforms one day. Blizzard thought about it but developers are currently focusing on the extension for PC and Mac. We will have to wait to know more. <br />

Patch 5.0.4 Class Guides<br />
There were a lot of class changes in Patch 5.0.4 and Icy Vein's class guides (http://www.icy-veins.com/classes-wow) are a good place to start catching up. <br />
<br />
These guides give a more in depth overview of the changes and new status of each class than the some of the guides in our Patch 5.0.4 preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2905-Patch-5-0-4-on-Live-Servers-This-Week), so they are worth a look if you already read some guides yesterday!<br />

Known Issue: Master Looter in Raids<br />
With the release of patch 5.0.4 Players who utilize the Master Looter option in Raid groups may encounter a known issue under certain conditions in which loot cannot be assigned to players outside of the Master Looter’s own group. <br />
<br />
We are currently working to resolve this issue in an upcoming fix. <br />
To work around this issue, Master Looters will need to move players they wish to award loot to into their own group. Please note that normal loot trading between players in Raid groups will still apply once the loot has been awarded by the Master Looter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Account-wide Mounts, Pets, and Achievements<br />
It’s finally here, and you’ll be able to enjoy just about every mount and pet you own on any character, and any license, under a single Battle.net account. You can also work on a wide variety of Achievements from multiple characters. Please be aware of the rules and guidelines we’ve just posted for how you can coalesce your account-wide pets and mounts smoothly and safely.<br />
<br />
*To see all of your achievements, pets, and mounts, you’ll want to log into every character at least once.<br />
<br />

Alterac Valley NPCs<br />
This is going to be a rather confusing explanation so bear with me.<br />
<br />
The BG NPCs have to be nerfed both on beta and on live to make sure they aren't too deadly in the 85-89 bracket. This nerf also applies, perhaps unintuitively, to the level 90 bracket on beta. However, once you are legitimately in the level 90 bracket on live, the NPCs should be more challenging.<br />
<br />
To complicate this explanation, we found that the 85-89 bracket for IOC was not nerfed correctly, but we have just fixed that. The IOC NPCs should be as weak as the AV ones now. <br />
<br />
But again, when you hit level 90 on live (not beta), they should be more challenging. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4768687029?page=24#461))<br />
<br />
Making all Pets and Mounts Account Wide<br />
You have to log into the character that has that mount first<br />
Indeed, and it’s highly recommended you log into all of your characters on every realm just to be sure every pet and mount is accounted for. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/233759-ravenlord-mount/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6412973971?page=1#10))<br />
<br />
Unable to Ride Some Flying Mounts<br />
Do you have the appropriate level riding capability (flight) for it? Also: Be sure to log onto the character that found it and learned it first. You have to log onto all your alts for their items to be shared.<br />
<br />
It's also worth noting that the violet proto-drake no longer grants the flying skill associated to ride it.<br />
<br />
Oh, and this too: You can't ride a flying mount at level 37 unless it is classified as both a ground/flying mount. The TLPD is not. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/233756-why-cant-i-ride-my-time-lost/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6412413905?page=1#5))<br />
<br />
Account-wide Pets with Patch 5.0.4<br />
You can have more than 4 of a particular pet type in your journal.<br />
This is correct. The migration was allowed to exceed the limit. It is a limit on the player collecting pets, going forward.<br />
<br />
Is the only way to get rid of the excess (I have so many rocket bots) releasing them?<br />
Yes. Please note that there are many pets that will have significant value once they can be caged (after Mists of Pandaria). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/233567-account-wide-pets-with-patch-504/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6413172080?page=23#456))<br />
<br />
Game Design and Character Progression<br />
This is a cop-out. I can't tell you how disappointed I was when I read this from a company that has claimed it believes giving players options to enjoy the game the way they want suddenly saying that options are a bad thing and shouldn't &quot;count&quot;.<br />
I think you're taking that out of context. For the players saying &quot;I want something to do after I finish my raid for the week,&quot; providing them very optional content (the examples I used were maxing out professions or achievements) isn't something that fits the bill for them. Telling them they can always find something to do if they try hard enough would be fairly considered a cop-out. They want some kind of directed gameplay with a sense of character progression.<br />
<br />
Options as a general philosophy are a great thing. We love options and we have tried to provide lots of options for max level players to progress their characters, such as scenarios, challenge modes, Raid Finder and daily quest hubs, in addition to options you've always had, such as dungeons, PvP and professions, and some new types of content that aren't tied to character progression, most obviously pet battles.<br />
<br />
We never want players to feel locked in to a character so we are making things account wide! *locks vp gear behind rep grinds that are not account wide*<br />
That's a tricky balance to strike. At the end of the day, the reason most players make alts is to have additional characters to play. I could just as easily say &quot;I feel locked to my priest because she has so much better gear than my rogue. I should be able to give any gear I pick up to my rogue and I should be able to share valor and conquest points among all my characters.&quot; Or you can take it to a silly extreme &quot;I already leveled up one character to 90, so I shouldn't have to do it for a second character.&quot; That really isn't that different from saying you don't want to do the level 90 quest content a second time.<br />
<br />
As I've said before, we don't think leveling an alt (and by &quot;leveling&quot; in this context I am technically including all of the progression you need to do to max out a character including level 90 content) needs to take as long as leveling your first character, but it should take some amount of time. Maybe we're erring on the side of being too conservative, but it's always easier to make game rules more forgiving than it is to tighten them up. (Players like gaining power and freedom by they hate to lose it.) <br />
<br />
For example, a compromise might be that you could buy an item at Exalted level that you could mail to an alt to give them a headstart. Maybe we re-introduce the tabards, but at Exalted level, but have them only work on quests, not dungeons, and make them bind-to-account to help a second character. Maybe it's okay to have factions be shared across accounts the way mounts and achievements are, but currency should only stay on the character who earned them. Or maybe it's the currency that should be BOA and not the factions. (Those are just brainstorming ideas -- not announcements.) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/233643-conflicting-game-desgin-uses/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6412423206?page=2#40))<br />

Aspects and the GCD<br />
As I said above, we're still not convinced the Aspect design is working as intended (which is to provide a decision for the hunter) and long term, we will likely continue to iterate on it.<br />
<br />
In the short term, our plan is to revert the recent change and return Aspects to off the GCD. Yes, you might just macro them again, but that seems to be the lesser of two evils compared to having them on the GCD.<br />
<br />
I can't provide any information on when this will happen. Hopefully we can fix it before you start leveling from 85 to 90. No promises. I'm just sharing our intent.

Guild Wars 2 was released on the 28th, but before release time even rolled around the game hit the 400,000 concurrent users (http://www.guildwars2guru.com/news/744-guild-wars-2-hits-400k-concurrent-users-before-launch/) mark from just the people with early access! More than one million copies were pre-ordered, giving the game a successful start. <br />
<br />
We also recently saw the first Level 80 character, Surfeuze! GW2Guru has an interview (http://www.guildwars2guru.com/news/746-interview-with-surfeuze-first-80-in-guild-wars-2/) with him talking about how he accomplished this speedy leveling. <br />

World of Warcraft Exclusive Look (2001)<br />
SamuraiSmurfette (http://www.reddit.com/user/SamuraiSmurfette) provided us with scans of one of the earlier looks at World of Warcraft from a 2001 edition of Computer Gaming World. Enjoy a look back almost 11 years ago at what WoW was planned to be during the earlier stages of development. If you are interested in the rest of that issue, or any others, you can find them over at Computer Gaming World Museum (http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=2001&amp;pub=2&amp;id=208).<br />

I have the Private and Sergeant titles on some of my old alts, but their titles weren't transferred to other characters from what I was able to see.

It's funny that when you go around everywhere, you see comments of people trying to take jabs at it or downplay its success. I don't even play the game but am so glad that it is blowing away all expectations when it comes to the numbers. Go ArenaNet!</div></div><hr />

It's 400k concurrent players. Meaning, at some point there were 400k players logged in at the same time, we have no idea how many players bought the game in total. Also this number is from the pre-launch period, it may have went up or down at launch.</div></div><hr />

Crushridge will be a desert/dead realm soon and i never have meet a foreign player before by playing on it, so i think its about 99% the italian population :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Yig</div><div class="date">2012-08-29, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have this magazine in my room, I haven't looked at it since just before TBC came out. I bought it when it was current on a road trip. I'd always wanted to play an MMO, but they were all too crappy and limited at the time, and re-reading this article now in 2012 I am suddenly reminded why WOW absolutely blew me away like no game I'd ever played. It was the first virtual world you could explore without loading times, a real world of different lands and terrains all linked with real bushes and creek beds and cave systems, no loading times. We'd talked about that for over a decade. Of course you could get that with a very basic graphical interface, that's what WOW did that nobody had ever done before that I had been waiting for practically all of my life. <br />
<br />
They made a seamless world that was visually dynamic and immersive, that was worth looking at. With actual gradual transitions between terrain, and foreshadowing, like clumps of vegetation and landscape bits that would show up in clusters and build until you were in a new place. <br />
<br />
We take all this for granted now so much in retrospect it's absurd to me how amazing this all seemed at the time. The naivety of 2004 seems like something gaming will never hold again for me, without something like virtual reality perhaps, and hopefully John Carmack is working on that now with the creator of the Occulus. <br />
<br />
This article reminds me of why after months and months of playing WOW, I was still sitting there playing WOW for the 8th or 12th hour back to back, amazed that I was still absolutely absorbed and captivated by the warm colorful glow of the screen, sometimes into the next day. I miss that.</div></div><hr />

Learn to read with understanding - those are not subs but people logged in and playing in same time. For example SWTOR had 350k on release in same time and game was advertised basically everywhere. So i suppose 400k pre-release is really really nice.</div></div><hr />

The old doomguard spell took 5 people to summon, and 1 would die. Then you had a rampaging doomguard running amok until you enslaved it.<br />

Other than that only ritual of summoning is close i suppose, requiring 3 people total.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Troll... unless you're just some kid looking for attention, you can clearly see, unless you're blind too, that ALL the models have changed a lot. Mind you that there is a difference between models and skeletons. Skeletons have not changed significantly in the past 7, maybe 11 years, but the resolution for the model skins has improved a lot for all races. Second, the female human model is completely different from what I can see in that article.<br />
<br />
The more important thing to see here aren't the graphics, but just the overall change the game has endured. The little amount of Vanilla I played 6 years ago is really hard to recall seeing as how I played an average of 5 hours a week and didn't really immerse myself in the game until much later in Burning Crusade, but this article has only made good memories crawl back to me about how unique the game was compared to a lot of the other games around for its time. It also made me think about why people always end up coming back to WoW after crashing and burning from their hyped up other MMO. People may end up just recalling this memory and linking it to every expansion, maybe every patch that Blizzard releases and wants to challenge Blizzard to see how long they can hold their interest based on how unique and exciting the new content is. The reason some people get disappointed with newer content is that they keep comparing it to a standard of uniqueness they had for it in 2004, but in reality its really hard to achieve the amount of unique qualities that came with the game when it was very first released. Just look at the dates in the article here: 2001 and from the article you can see some of the screenshots of the world already which means for the next 3 years Blizzard had worked very hard to bring you the outstanding game that it was in 2004. They have continued working this hard on newer content but they were given far shorter time frames to work within. How do you think the game would measure up today if they put the amount of work and time into each and every patch and expansion that they did with the release of the game, granted that we might only be as far as Wrath of the Lich King today?</div></div><hr />

Spamming shield was fine before the mana pool nerf.

Also, doomguard summoning, where one member of the summoning party was sacrificed.<br />
<br />
Those were good times...<br />

Anyway, back to GW2, i have a whole new world to discover and enjoy, and sure as fuck, i am.<br />

<br />
It really is too bad they didn't take it that direction. There are screenshots around of early WoW with language profficiencies and other mixed-faction elements. It would seem like they had taken those from Everquest, which may be the reason they dumped the idea. Dark Age of Camelot having three distinct realms may have been an added factor, though the mixed-faction screenies of WoW were as late as 2003 (along with housing), so that was scrapped late (anyone know if those were in open Beta?)</div></div><hr />

Original goldshire was far better than what it ended up as, good thing they never kept the &quot;2 humans and Orcs working on the relationship&quot; which sounded very kinky and wrong the way the article was worded ;)</div></div><hr />

To be fair, MMO-Champion pretty much is WOW-Champion, and has been for years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your math skills astound me. You realize that the 400k is ALL the 1M. 1M got in early, 400k happened to play at the same time (probably when headstart launched).<br />
<br />
Just to put it in perspective.. AOC presold more boxes.....<br />

Goldshire looks so much bigger in WoW 2001 than it does now :P<br />
<br />
They actually nerfed Goldshire when they realized they didn´t have time to make all the starter ´towns´ the same. Their original plan was for all the towns to be as big as goldshire... but instead of making 7 big towns, they just nerfed one.</div></div><hr />

I'm still amazing that it did so well and has lasted so long, when I first saw it on a friends computer in first year, I passed over it saying I'd probably never like it (was into CS and AoE at the time). Now I'm still playing and most of my friends that couldn't stop talking about it back then have long since quit.<br />
<br />
Funny stuff :)</div></div><hr />

One of the biggest problems I thought with Cataclysm. And thankfully that thought was echoed by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

If you've never played Everquest, maybe you don't really get this.<br />
<br />
Back in EQ, which mostly revolved around grinding mobs to gain exp, people would basically stake their claims and camp certain groups of mobs.<br />
<br />
So if you were playing, you'd maybe see a group of people totally dominating a camp of sand giants, so you'd have to go play somewhere else, for example.</div></div><hr />

Look at the Blizzard's NO-NO list arround page 78 on the PDF, look at the last one.<br />
No Rats and Bunnies to kill hmmmm ok, those bunnies arround the pandaria farms are not bunnies !<br />
Nor is the Darkmoon Rabbit (wowhead.com/item=80008) and Giant Sewer Rat (wowhead.com/spell=59250) ...<br />
(Sorry can't post direct links yet - and kudos to the person who gets the reference before reading the item)<br />
