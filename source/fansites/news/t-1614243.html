Warlords of Draenor - Vicious War Raptor<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Vicious War Raptor (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116778-vicious-war-raptor). This is the new Horde PvP mount in Patch 6.0.2, sold by Deathguard Netharian (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/73151-deathguard-netharian) for Vicious Saddle (http://www.wowdb.com/items/103533-vicious-saddle). If you don't already have a saddle, you can get one from the Primal Combatant (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/9236-primal-combatant) achievement when Warlords of Draenor launches.<br />

<br />
New Character Model Changes<br />
Are the new models done?<br />
Sorry about that, it's not intentional. We're still looking through and collecting feedback, and of course still have the Blood Elf update to go. We don't really consider anything in the game as &quot;done&quot;, it's a constantly moving and changing and evolving game. In addition to going through stylistic feedback, there are a number of items that are simply bugs we'll be addressing, like facial feature options clearly not matching up (most obvious being Undead eyes appearing where no eyes existed before).<br />
<br />
If you have any threads/images/videos you think encapsulate your feedback particularly well, feel free to share them. Can never have too many links.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Arthas Costume ChargesThe charges on the item appearing as 1 (instead of 50) while on the vendor is due to a separate bug we're tracking. Many items throughout the game may be currently showing 1 charge, but when purchased will display their correct amount of charges remaining. It's a bug we're working to address but won't be within the Lich King costume fixes. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/345315-the-arthas-costume/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/14926872836?page=23#444))<br />

Any reason Ele has 0 mana regen whatsoever? Are they just intended to be horrible in WoD because there is really no reason.<br />
Their damage spells have almost no cost. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522839978972176384))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
If I skip Tectus/Brackenspore and kill Mar'gok, can I go back and kill them, or will the raid &quot;complete&quot; with Mar'gok's death?<br />
You can go back and kill them. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522761494120120322))<br />
<br />
According to patch note, each diff. should have its own lockout. But 10m &amp; 25m Legacy raids are sharing them. Is this intended?<br />
That's for Siege of Orgrimmar and Draenor raids. All other raids unaffected. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522846853671305216))<br />
<br />
Releasing in Siege or UBRS dodges a load screen. Will the old raids/instances see that too?<br />
Draenor dungeons/raids will all work that way as well. We'll likely retrofit it to older instances in the future. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/522853610825064449))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
So honor not dropping from the rares and honor not coming from the isle of thunder quests intended or bug?<br />
Intended. Those NPCs/quests served their purpose during Mists. The time has come to remove them. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522531702002831362))<br />
<br />
18 honor per win your joking right increase honor win cos 18 honor per win i wont even get full s15 on my hunter sort it!<br />
Battlegrounds in Mists rewarded approximately 20 honor/minute for the winner. 18 for a fast skirmish win isn't far off. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522532392632741888))<br />
At level 100, you'll be getting that honor AND a box that might have a piece of gear you need. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522532530973470720))<br />
<br />
The new group finder is pretty awful for PvP... At least add 2v2, 3v3, 5v5, RBG categories?<br />
When the season starts there will be arena and RBG categories. Pretty pointless to have them out of season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/522585831748300800))<br />

Yeah, because it was destroying the game. People being trees for fun and possibly blocking thigs like mail boxes and NPCs. Oh, wait. They can do that already on large flying mounts and ground mounts.<br />
<br />
Blizz should nerf the size of all mounts to be only one scale in size.<br />

Better nerf tauren and draenei too then. They can block mail boxes just by standing on them. Even on small tiny mounts.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are raid encounters not working properly post patch, and they hotfix the skymirror.<br />

<br />
Not always. <br />
<br />
I've put in many a ticket for not being able to pick up the quests from Skar'this the Hereticin Heroic Slave Pens. Namely the Mark of Vashj and the Cudgel of Kar'desh.<br />
If I make a toon tomorrow and level it to level 70 I can pick up the quest and complete it no problem, hell you can even roll a pandaren and pick up the quest and do it, they weren't even around in TBC. But the warrior i've had for 5 years that is now level 90 cannot do the quest. Soon as you ding level 71 you are no longer eligable to pick up the quest. you can pick up the quest at level 70, continue to level to max, complete the quest then turn it in and you are fine. <br />
<br />
All other quests as far as I am aware can be pick up and completed at max level. I can do all the quests for all the raids and dungeons at whatever the current max level is no issues, except for Serpentshrine Cavern. The quests are still ingame and you can still do them, you won't get a title if you do them now, but you can still do them. Unless you are higher than level 70, in which case you can't.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't even want the title I know I can't get, and I know you can enter the raid without having done the quest. I just want to do the attunement quest on my toon that I have done every other attunement quest on, my warrior is my main, I do everything on him, pets, mounts, quests, achievements, RP vanity items, tier, weapons. I'll level another class if they can do something my warrior clearly can't, druid flight form quests, warlock dreadsteed/green fire, but the serpentshrine cavern attunement quests are something every class can do, even today.<br />
<br />
Being forced to make and level an alt to complete a quest I should be able to complete on my main is a more of a bug that needs fixing than how a few players choose to spent their afk time in major cities.</div></div><hr />

The point I was trying to make is, that's not how the encounter used to work pre patch. All you had to do either solo or in a group was stand in middle and he would level out, or secure yourself in a tentacle hole. Now you have to run side to side to stop it happening, and it happens if you are solo or in a group. Deathwing never used to try to roll like that pre patch, so clearly there is something broken about the fight post patch that should be fixed ahead of other things that are less detrimental to people's gaming experience.</div></div><hr />

Battlegrounds in Mists rewarded approximately 20 honor/minute for the winner. 18 for a fast skirmish win isn't far off. (holinka)<br />
At level 100, you'll be getting that honor AND a box that might have a piece of gear you need. (holinka)&quot;<br />

Ah that makes sense, never tried soloing it before the patch. Then I do agree with you :-) But it is still soloable for about any class at the moment (not sure about mage)</div></div><hr />

Their damage spells have almost no cost. (holinka)<br />
<br />
That's nice and all, but this makes Lightning Bolts mana-negative, and means going OOM sooner or later if one has to off-heal. Having limited mana during extended off-healing is fine, but recovery when not doing so should be possible without having to stop damage output.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Never fixing the things that actually need fixing. Spine of Deathwing is constantly rolling even if you stand directly centre and try to level him out, but no blizzard nerfs using the sky mirror to turn into a tree.<br />
<br />
You DO realize you could just hold the bloods on one of the open sores, right? They don't fly off Deathwing's back, and it trivializes having to move from left to right every 5 seconds (which is what you should be doing, not trying to stand in the centre) <br />
<br />
If you cannot hold that much damage and need to move back and forth, then don't stand in one spot for too long. Use your movement speed buffs if you get slowed.</div></div><hr />

Yeah because you want every casual running flex to be running around with what is, probably the most iconic item in the game. Use some common sense maybe ?</div></div><hr />

With a 1% drop chance? I don't think so, besides heroic is only a little bit harder than normal right now, it's almost hard to tell the freaking difference between them.</div></div><hr />

What about it? I solo'd it on 5 toons this weekend, two of which were so bady geared they couldn't even get yogg 25h down... but spine 10 man norm was 1 shot easy stuff.<br />

Actually this did happen to me more than once prepatch, alone and in groups of 2-3, never did understand why sometimes he went roll crazy and others you could just stand in the middle, but this same thing happened pre-6.0 to me a few times.</div></div><hr />

This is true, but in Holinka's defense, they probably didn't understand the question. The person asking the question, or making the demand rather really needs to take an English course or at least a writing course.<br />

Sure hope they'll review female trolls...their run style is INCREDIBLY dead and flat, it has no real motion to it other than her legs going back and forth. It's as if they went too far with some races (male nelf, dwarf, human) and not at all with others...<br />
<br />
Male human needs a bit of work, I'm not understanding how you consider it complete. In addition, male Night Elf is one of the most complained about updates. Dwarves were done really well but if you really want to put blame on the time spread you should be looking at Orcs. Orcs are arguably the best looking new models and obviously what they spent the most time on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mythic has locked raid IDs, like the old days. You cannot join someone else's Mythic if you've done one yourself, just as well, if the people you ran with complete that raid ID it will end up completed on your end as well.</div></div><hr />

Er, they have been adding redone original race mounts as PvP rewards for a while now. On the Horde side we have had the Wolf and Forsaken mount already. Alliance has had the Steed and Night Elf mount redone. With the Ram being added now as well.<br />
<br />
But please, don't let facts get in the way of good drama.</div></div><hr />
