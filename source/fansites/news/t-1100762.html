The beta is now &quot;very close&quot; and Blizzard finally clarified how invites will work for people who bought the WoW Annual Pass.<br />
We’re very close to beginning beta testing for World of Warcraft®: Mists of Pandaria™! Over the course of the beta test, we’ll be inviting Annual Pass holders, press, fansites, friends and family, and opt-in beta testers to participate. As there’s no NDA for this test, you’re likely to start seeing lots of screenshots and new video around the web. Please keep in mind that the game is still in development, and what you’ll see during the beta test is not necessarily representative of the final game.<br />
<br />
If you’re wondering how you can help us test Mists of Pandaria, or how the test works, look no further than the paragraphs directly below this one.<br />
<br />
How do I opt-in?<br />
Once you’ve set up a Battle.net account and have attached at least one Blizzard game, you can choose to opt in to our beta tests from the Beta Profile page. You’ll need to select which franchises you’d be interested in helping test, as well as download and run the System Check tool to attach your computer’s specifications to your beta profile. Once that’s complete it’s simply a matter of waiting for an invite.<br />
<br />
How will I know if I’m selected?<br />
We’ll send you an email letting you know when you’re selected, but please be aware of phishing attempts. Some unscrupulous individuals send out falsified emails purporting to be from Blizzard, but are in fact meant to steal your login credentials. For more information on how to identify these emails please refer to our Battle.net Security site. One easy way to ensure your invite is legit is to avoid clicking on links in any invite emails you receive, and instead log in to your Battle.net account and see if you have a Mists of Pandaria beta license attached. If there’s no license, you can be sure the email you received was not from Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I am participating in the World of Warcraft Annual Pass promotion; when do I begin testing?<br />
We’re inviting Annual Pass holders in waves over the course of the beta test, and will be ramping up the number of invites we send as quickly as possible. We’ll be inviting Annual Pass holders based on several factors, including how long your World of Warcraft account has been active and when you signed up for the Annual Pass. Keep an eye on your Battle.net account and email for your invite to join the beta test.<br />
<br />
How many players do you plan to invite to the beta test?<br />
Our primary focus will be ensuring that all of the players who signed up for the Annual Pass are invited over the course of the beta test. The number of additional players we invite will be based on our testing needs. If during the course of testing we determine we need more players to participate, we’ll invite more.<br />
<br />
Is there an NDA?<br />
There is no Non-Disclosure Agreement for the Mists of Pandaria beta test. Those invited to play are free to take screenshots, movies, or stream the game content. Please be aware that the game is very much still a work in progress, and we appreciate your understanding when you encounter bugs, graphical errors, or other issues.<br />
<br />
How long will the beta test last?<br />
We have not determined an exact date for the end of the beta test. We’ll post a notice when the beta test is nearing completion.</div></div><hr />

Except nothing in the actual contract said when you would get in. The advertisement page before the contract doesn't count.<br />

Yes, you have a guaranteed chance to be able to participate in the beta.<br />

The non-annual pass holders do not have any guarantees<br />

I'd laugh if anybody tried that. People didn't seriously think Blizzard was going to let the millions who signed up for the annual pass in at once?<br />

There's no way it was ever going to be ONLY Annual Pass holders in the beta. If you got the Annual Pass for the beta, you should have been thinking that it was for the GUARANTEE of a beta invite... not that it was the ONLY way to get into the beta.</div></div><hr />

Your still getting diablo 3 for free though, but I hope that doesn't get released in waves too. ;)<br />

<br />
I think you're confused. It said you would get beta access for Mists of Pandaria, and that you would get a free copy of Diablo that would be available on release day. I signed up for the pass the day it became available, and I have the original contract printed out from that day, and nowhere does it say &quot;you get into the beta day one&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only down side of that is, your not actually signing a contract when taking part of the annual pass. A contact is legally binding and unable be allowed to op-out of it, as with the annual pass you can op-out of it at any given time but you lose all your rewards.<br />
<br />
so blizzard can do anything with the beta waves, regarding to the annual passes.</div></div><hr />

This is true, over the last couple months a lot of friends that took the annual pass also quit and just put a stop order with there banks, so yeah the fact people can opt out without consequences also means they can change the rules. Fair is Fair.</div></div><hr />

My account is 7 years old and in those 7 years I payed for more than 6 and a half years... Just hope having taken a wow break for a month about a year ago doesn't screw me.<br />
<br />
It will also be interesting to know if they are giving US players an antiquity advantage, considering the game got released in europe about 4 months later.<br />
<br />
At least I know I signed up for the pass on the day it was announced... Fingers crossed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the news that over 1 million people signed up for the annual pass came out some time ago, there is no way you could not have anticipated this.<br />
<br />
I'm honestly more surprised they are even bothering with an opt-in at all at this point.</div></div><hr />

Are you guys expecting a medal for staying with wow until it shuts down in 10 years from now or are you really enjoying the game still?<br />

tbh I am very suprised myself, I just hope a lot of these people can let go when the time comes otherwise they going to be very unhappy with the wasted time on there death beds.</div></div><hr />

They said they were going to start invites based on several factors, including length of time you have had the account and the time you signed up for the annual pass. Notice the key words there: SEVERAL FACTORS and INCLUDING. This means there are any number of other factors that could help you get into the beta just as fast and being a day 1 sub and having signed up the very second the pass went live. Don't get so hung up on the little details and just enjoy all the time you do get to spend in the Beta, hopefully using it for what it's really for: FINDING AND REPORTING BUGS IN GAMEPLAY!!!</div></div><hr />

You have to be mindful the advertisement is non-binding. What the contract says is what you have to pay attention to and, as far as I remember, it does not guarantee a first-wave entry. It sucks, but it's how that works. Plus, it would be close to impossible to get all the people with a annual pass in for the first wave without major server crashes and/or lag.</div></div><hr />

I'm aware of the technical challenges - as to whether or not their &quot;landing page&quot; text was binding: it depends on where you live. I'm actually unaware under what law they are in general here in EU, but if they had been a Danish company, the actual text/image on the landing page would have been legally binding as well (I've worked in internet business living off doing advertised sells through landing pages).</div></div><hr />

It feels like it's misleading towards the customer and that is not good for any company, but like already has been pointed out, it's not legally binding.

<br />
Yeah, I'm not sure about which law you have to go through, but I guess Danish law would still apply since you (apparently) reside there and that's where you celebrated the contract, yea? Plus, in order for your country to be eligible they must have had to secure the proper legal channels, but since they don't operate FROM Denmark, it might be fishy. I guess they abide to French law as that seems to be their EU base of operation?</div></div><hr />

I know that is what you pointed out. I was pointing out it's not legally binding. This time I'll add &quot;in this case&quot; :P Even if under French law (where Blizz has their EU office) the landing page would be legally binding, the wording of the beta test invites as part of the annual pass would still leave a lot of room for (legal) interpretation. What is available for instance? Isn't the moment you get an invite the moment it becomes available to you? etc. etc.</div></div><hr />

He clearly state, and im sure will be most important factor, its how old your account is and how payed it was. But surely, by knowing blizzard already for many years, they will start the selection with USA, Germany, France and Spain. After, we start to talk about other countries, so even if your account its since 2005 non stop payed and u also signed up for the anual pass in very first day of it, im pretty sure that if you are for example from an east european country or just south america, you gonna get the beta invite among the last.</div></div><hr />

I think it's actually the text here that is misleading and causing everyone to get upset. Note that it doesn't say, &quot;Your beta access will go live with the beta launch,&quot; but &quot;beta access will go live with the beta launch.&quot; Thus, technically, if they give even one person beta access at beta launch, they have lived up to what they actually said.<br />

Note that it doesn't say, &quot;Your beta access will go live with the beta launch,&quot; but &quot;beta access will go live with the beta launch.&quot; Thus, technically, if they give even one person beta access at beta launch, they have lived up to what they actually said.<br />

A: You'll be able to download and play Diablo III as soon as it's available and once you complete the one-year term, it's yours to keep, even if you cancel your subscription. Tyrael's Charger will be available with Patch 4.3, and beta access will go live with the beta launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully it will be more like weeks. They need a lot of people to download a lot of MoP data, get some server stability testing with smaller groups at first, increasingly larger groups as time passes probably. Beta testing in itself can be very annoying due to bugs and server crashes or extreme laggyness. I am pretty sure Blizzard will want to avoid a shitstorm of drama from the people that signed up thinking they could play the real MoP in the beta already as much as possible. I'd count on weeks, but I am pretty certain it won't be days. :(</div></div><hr />

Except for the last part where it says &quot;Terms subject to change without notice&quot;. Which means they can do whatever they want, up to and including revoking beta access from the offer.<br />
<br />
The phrase that keeps getting quoted was on the advertisement splash page. What you are implying is that them mentioning dance studios in the Wrath announcement trailer then not including that in the final game constitutes breach of contract, which it obviously does not.</div></div><hr />

Beta access will be available at Beta launch sure. But to whom? That's where you're making the mistake. You're assuming they mean you will get it. Clearly they didn't. Did they know you'd assume that and sign up under that assumption? Probably. But nowhere did they promise you specifically that you would get access on day 1.<br />

Wrong. If they said it that way how many people would have signed up to wait for waves of others before them to get access first?

I agree. Ive played all of Blizzard's games since Warcraft: Orcs and Humans and have not been in a single beta even though Ive signed up for them on multiple accounts.

Wrong again. Reading comprehension also covers punctuation. See that period there at the end of that sentence about Diablo 3?

Not everyone subscribes to the archaic ideas of old. Quite a few, including myself, are having a great time with the game. Just because your opinion doesn't care for the game, it doesn't mean it somehow makes our opinions invalid. I will never understand people like you, why hang around a forum dedicated too a game you no longer play? Is it just too attack those of us who still like it, or is it because you want some god damned cookie for your opinion? It annoys me to no end that people still find the need to come on here and act like because they played since Vanilla their opinions somehow have a higher weight then others. I played since a month after launch, and imo, all I can say is Blizzard has done a great job. I love the direction they have taken then game, if you want some terrible grind fest, go play Aion, or one of the Korean MMO's that are just insane on difficulty.</div></div><hr />

If they stated that they were going to do it in waves and the criteria to get it earlier would have to do when you signed up for the Annual Pass they would have gotten even more people signing up and quicker.

Anyway, I'll start the bidding at total time played of 510 days across all toons. Im curious how many days people who have been playing since Vanilla have.</div></div><hr />

A: You'll be able to download and play Diablo III as soon as it's available and once you complete the one-year term, it's yours to keep, even if you cancel your subscription. Tyrael's Charger will be available with Patch 4.3, and beta access will go live with the beta launch.<br />
<br />
Here I'll bold and underline the part for you okay?<br />
<br />
YOU WILL be able to access diablo 3, tyrael's charger, beta.<br />
<br />
That You'll is for Diablo 3. Sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
couldn't agree with you more i got cata beta and all that happened is the majority treating it as a demo and then there was the odd few myself included that did pretty much every quest and burned the hell out of the leave feedback option and actually searched for bugs yes the server stability was horrid bugs everywhere but thats the point of beta to find these bugs its a shame more people dont see it for what it is a test and not a damn demo of the game</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">shootyadead</div><div class="date">2012-03-21, 06:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually when you begin a new topic you start a new paragraph. It's the same as when you refer to a person you don't say the persons name over n over while writing a story, eventually it will change to he or she implying that it's still talking about that person.<br />
Sure you do, sometimes. Except when the next sentence is still part of the main topic you are covering in this paragraph. They were still talking about the promotional items that you were gaining from signing up for the annual pass, therefore no new paragraph was needed. However they were done talking about Diablo 3 so they stopped and started a new sentence. See how that works?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xebtria</div><div class="date">2012-03-21, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the annual pass splash screen it was read as &quot;when beta starts, you have an invite&quot;. Now it is in waves. And it will be based on when your account was created and when you signed up for the annual pass.<br />
<br />
Well... I don't really have a problem with that. My account is active since May or June 2005, but it took me a bit time to sign up for the annual pass, it wasn't instantly when it was announced.<br />
<br />
I don't need to be online the very second the beta invites come up, but neither I want to wait too long. let's say, out of experience, the beta will last something between 4 and 5 month. I have no problem when I have to wait 1 or maybe 2 weeks until I get my invitation, but sure as hell I don't want to wait 2 month. I got a guarantee to get beta access when the beta goes online. What is a guarantee worth if I have to wait 2 month? As said, one week more or less isn't a big deal, but I hope it's as soon as possible. And I would also expect that, when I would have created my account yesterday just to sign up for the annual pass so I get the beta.<br />
<br />
If anybody who has signed up for the annual pass has to wait longer than one or two weeks until he has access to the beta, it's pretty close to false advertisement then.</div></div><hr />

Now people won't sign up because they'll be afraid they'll get it a week before the actual game comes out.<br />
<br />
Actually no. By only telling us now that there are going to be waves of people getting into the beta they ensured a constant stream of people signing up for the annual pass. If you missed the first few days of the signup for some reason and then saw that you'd have to wait through waves before you could get in because others beat you to the punch you'd be a lot more tempted to just say screw it, i'll wait. Instead, they left it very vague and open for people to interpret however they would, most assuming they'd get instant access, which they may/may not.</div></div><hr />

Usually you'll have an icon available on your account page of battle.net showing that your beta is available now. If you start getting emails saying come into beta, just check there to verify.</div></div><hr />

The same could be said of you,<br />

Some of you seem to be focusing on only part of what was said. They said they were going to start invites based on several factors, including length of time you have had the account and the time you signed up for the annual pass. Notice the key words there: SEVERAL FACTORS and INCLUDING. This means there are any number of other factors that could help you get into the beta just as fast and being a day 1 sub and having signed up the very second the pass went live. Don't get so hung up on the little details and just enjoy all the time you do get to spend in the Beta, hopefully using it for what it's really for: FINDING AND REPORTING BUGS IN GAMEPLAY!!!</div></div><hr />

you could argue, that the exclusive part applies to the &quot;beta access will go live at the beta launch&quot;.<br />
which would translate: if you have annual pass, you get beta access ass soon as the beta launches. when you have not, well, it might take a little while for you. and tbh, I'll nerdrage a little inside myself if anyone not signed up for the annual pass has beta access earlier than me.. ;D</div></div><hr />

Explain to me how exactly i am wrong? Just because Blizzard flat out said we will be activating in waves does prove me wrong in blizzard way of going about it.

Actually no you cant' because the beta access being live at the beta launch wasn't listed on the exclusive benefits part. Guaranteed access to the beta is the benefit listed. Not guaranteed access at launch.<br />
<br />

<br />
Then why was beta access represented as an 'exclusive benefit' (by being discussed in that paragraph) when it really wasn't? Why wasn't it under another category like 'non-exclusive benefits'? Either way there has been deceptive advertising.<br />
<br />
It wasn't. Guaranteed access to the beta was the exclusive benefit. And yes I know everyone thinks I'm contradicting what I said earlier but I'm not. The wording here is very precise and that's the important part people are failing to see. Guaranteed access to the beta is the exclusive benefit. Meaning that you can only guarantee you are getting into the beta by getting the annual pass. However, Beta access is not the same as guaranteed beta access. Anyone can get lucky and get beta access. Only annual pass holders are guaranteed it though. Trust me, this is about the shadiest advertising ever, but they did it perfectly. You can't beat Blizz at this, they're just too damn good.<br />

Does this mean if I took a 6 month break from January 2011-June 2011 it decreases my chances of getting into the first wave?<br />

Noone was. That's exactly where they got people. They worded it so you thought you'd be in instantly, which is why a lot of people are crying foul. But they did not ever guarantee anyone anything other than access at some point before the end of the beta.</div></div><hr />

Q: When do I get Diablo III and the other exclusive benefits? A: You'll be able to download and play Diablo III as soon as it's available and once you complete the one-year term, it's yours to keep, even if you cancel your subscription. Tyrael's Charger will be available with Patch 4.3, and beta access will go live with the beta launch. <br />
<br />
Alright, this is a simple Q&amp;A (question &amp; Answer). The question here is &quot;When do I...&quot;, which is key in this question. It is directly being asked by the person signing up for the offer. The answer, is responding to you directly and what you get, not what other people get and when, but directly to the person signing up for the offer. There is no other way to read this question in answer and come up with a different conclusion. The fact here is that the Subscriber was asking a question, and the company making the offer was answering that question purely based on that subscriber, and not other subscribers. <br />
<br />
&quot;They were just talking about beta access, not directly to you.&quot; - unfortunately that does not work as they were answering a direct question to a specific person. Seriously, if you people can not comprehend a simple Q&amp;A, I really hope you aren't studying law or already in a law based field. <br />
<br />
With that said, I feel slightly conned in this deal, but at least I'm still getting D3, and a beta access &quot;eventually&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Haha, love it. ;) Yeah I just hope everyone realizes it's all Activision. Blizzard honestly cares about their players, but unfortunately they're not in charge anymore. Big man up top says we gotta do this and trick people and do things very shady so I guess that's what we do.

Actually I understand the Q&amp;A quite well in fact. The problem is that the person asking the question cannot and does not represent the entire player base. Under your reasoning, if the person that asked the question does not gain immediate access to the beta at launch then sure they could sue. I've said it several times and I'll say it once again. Beta access is not part of the exclusive benefits package and therefore you cannot assume you will get it when it is launched, as per the answer to the question. Guaranteed access is the benefit and it will indeed be granted at launch, just in waves starting at launch, as they've already described.</div></div><hr />

You are right. They are right from legal point of view, so of course no one is going to sue them for it or anything. But that was a definitely lousy move from their side. A lot of their customers who bought annual pass right now are dissappointed and they have lost the trust of them. Okay, speaking for myself, my own trust. It's okay for a cheater to do things this way, saying &quot;Hey, have you seen that asterisk and that smaaaall text addition to our contract with number *****-**-**? Now you understand that money/business/apartment/car is now mine. Please get out from my sight&quot;, but it's not okay for a company who want their customers to believe them and to continue subscribing.<br />
<br />
It's like a elected politician saying &quot;Okay I promised that one granny to raise her retirement money percent, but only her, all of you please calm yourself you cannot sue me or ask for anything&quot;. Can they sue him? No. Will they re-elect him? Definitely no as well. <br />

I'm with you there. I think the only beta playing I really want to do is to see some of the new environments a little bit, try out the new talent system, and learn a bit of the mechanics of the monks. Other than that I will probably watch some of the videos to learn the raids when they come out (being a raid leader and all) and that's about it. I don't want to get burned out early so I'll wait and experience the game first hand.<br />

I'm not here to argue with you, as I do not believe with arguing with under educated people, so I will leave this with this post:<br />
<br />
The guaranteed beta invite is an exclusive perk for the people who signed up for the annual pass, as the rest of the player base do not have a guaranteed invite coming their way as the opt-in is a lottery system.<br />
<br />
The question asked was from the subscribers point of view and there is no way to read that any differently as that is exactly how the question is worded. The question is written saying &quot;When do I..&quot; which means the response is directly towards when the subscriber gains their perks.<br />

Thank god it is not like that. Blizzard needs to invite players from top guilds and top pvpers to test the game before releasing it. There is not guarantee that people who bought the annual pass are skilled ones. There are things that everyone can test, and things that need good players. The difficulty of the new raids is a good example.</div></div><hr />

Maybe (read maybe, because it's doubtful) they'll let those who have signed up most recently with the newer accounts in first and make those who have been around longer wait, so that they keep the new player base interested. I doubt it'll happen but you never know with Activision calling the shots.</div></div><hr />

Sorta makes it seem like a bit of a scam, if I'm honest. One of the main reasons many of us got the pass was for beta...<br />
<br />
The pass merely guarantees a beta spot, as I read it. Anyway... who cares. Bring on the beta! :-)</div></div><hr />

The waves will occur fast and in large quantaties - everyone will have plenty of time in the beta. It won't be anything like normal beta's where the last people have only 1 or 2 days to play.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't be surprised since the Blue post was written at 5 am EU about the Beta. Just look at how the blue post is written ? ''Do this and that, remember that and this'' Oh well, we will see !</div></div><hr />

Technically they didn't sell the annual pass, you subscribed to it. They only removed the ability to opt out of it within the last week because they knew this was going to happen. They knew that players would be opting out in droves once they found out they weren't getting instant access. Again this is clearly an Activision design as I have stated before but Blizz will take the heat for it.</div></div><hr />

Riddle me this Batman,*what's*the sadder behaviour?: *playing a game for a long, long time and continuing to enjoy it, or reading about a game you*don't*even play for a long, long time and whimsically trying to mock those who undoubtedly*aren't*as attached to the game as you realise?*<br />

<br />
Weekly maintenance in the US isn't Wednesday morning, it's Tuesday morning. Therefore this is outside of the scheduled maintenance window and could very well be the beta going live. We don't know for sure but going with what Boubouille said I'm figuring it will indeed be the beta.</div></div><hr />

Depends if the poster is in US or EU as to whether this is normal maint then. EU is in maint atm.<br />

Ehh... Usually their mainteance goes from Tuesday to Wednesday from 5 am to 11 am. <br />
Nothing unusal about this one excpet they postponed it 1 hour.</div></div><hr />

That's for EU maintenance. US maintenance is Tuesday at the same time. The US battle.net server is also down meaning this isn't regular maintenance.</div></div><hr />

Meh, if something special is up, which i believe there is, then it should be the same weird mainteance as for both EU and US - Only difference i see on EU is as i wrote, they postponed it 1 hour. Anyway, i expect to see my beta invite asap ! Got my account active for 7 years now, and bought annual pass as soon as you were able to.</div></div><hr />

My account has been active for 5 years and 8 months. Doesn't mean I expect access from day one, although it'd be nice. People expect too much and then moan when their dreams are shattered.</div></div><hr />

That just means they're going to look at those things. It could also mean that they use them the other way and give it to those who haven't been here that long to keep them interested/playing. Never know with Blizz/Activision.</div></div><hr />
