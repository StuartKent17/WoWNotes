Tier 12 Preview - Paladin Armor Set<br />
It's time for another Tier 12 Preview! Today I decided to make the millions of paladins on our forums happy with a nice and shiny video of their new armor set. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, there's a &quot;Pants&quot; version, but it doesn't mean it will be used. So far the only official set is the brown/orange version with the robe. <br />
The loop in the back of the Paladin is tied to the helm, not the shoulders. <br />
As usual, recolors are usually here for NPCs or non-set items. It doesn't mean that it will be impossible to get them in-game, but it doesn't mean you'll get them either. <br />
<br />

NPC Model - Nozdormu<br />
Nozdormu (http://www.wowpedia.org/Nozdormu) finally got his own model in this patch.<br />
<br />

PTR Raid Testing Schedule 5/20<br />
Friday, May 20<br />
EU 10:30 AM PDT – Shannox (10 Player)<br />
US 4:30 PM PDT – Beth’tilac (25 Player)<br />
<br />
Shannox Testing Note:<br />
The creatures spawned in the middle of the volcanic plains will be active for the test. To spawn Shannox, you must defeat a few of them. The number of creatures needed to spawn Shannox has been modified for PTR.<br />
<br />
As always, the schedule can change at a moment’s notice due to issues with the build, server, encounter, or the mercurial nature of designers. The encounters are all a work in progress; there will be bugs and tuning is not final.<br />
<br />

Does the Dungeon Journal kills the discovery and inventiveness of raiding?<br />
We have not in fact made the statement that &quot;Discovery and inventiveness in raiding is bad” with the introduction of the Dungeon Journal. We have simply said, &quot;Here are the tools to be successful. Go forth and conquer.&quot; We have in no way said &quot;how&quot; to do it nor is that our intention for this feature. The ability to play your character within a team of other people is all up to you and your skills. We're just trying to make it more possible to be successful within the game with information that lends itself to aiding success.<br />
<br />
We want the discovery and challenge to come into play as a result of actually facing the mechanics versus simply being beaten by the mechanics of the game to begin with to even start working on a strategy to defeat the encounter (which is what many top raiding guilds end up doing.) It's very difficult for anyone to claim that discovery is a large portion of the game when we live in a world of datamining, PTR videos, boss kill addons, and extensive documentation of everything by a very savvy and experienced gaming community.<br />
<br />
We want to provide a common language to communicate with as well. What exists now is something that has evolved over time in an organic way, but not everyone is speaking the same &quot;language&quot;. This way, you can call the &quot;big blue thing&quot; by its name rather than resorting to trying to describe it or make up a new name for it.<br />
<br />
We know that players already go out to outside sources to look for information. On some occasions, this information may even have misinterpretations of the boss abilities and cause some frustration for those who are attempting to kill the mob based on that information. We're simply making what you're facing a bit clearer where it needs to be made clear. This isn’t the fault of those documenting these things. From our end, not all abilities that bosses use are as clear as we could have made them or should make them be.<br />
<br />
It's expected that the top-end guilds that like to go for the first kill/s will still be able to accomplish this with or without the Dungeon Journal existing. We have no fear that they will suddenly be overrun and lose their place simply because everyone is starting with the same information.<br />
<br />
That said, we have been listening to feedback as well and have trimmed back a little of the information. We also may consider (for the future) not documenting specific abilities for very difficult bosses like Sinestra, or heroic modes on final bosses like Ragnaros, or even what exactly causes Onyxia to deep breathe. Getting solid constructive feedback that we can consider to set into motion for change is always welcome and useful to us.<br />
<br />
If all else, if you still want to take on encounters without the use of the Dungeon Journal, you can. Just don't open it. What you don’t know, will probably kill/wipe you. ;) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/176567/dungeon-journal-down-the-spiral-we-go) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2522435462?page=5#86))</div></div><hr />

Paladin Tier: Like the helm, and overall the set, but the chestpiece seems a tad TOO much cloth. Not a cloth vs plate issue for me, but alot of the chest is just gray boring. Also I hope that tauren helm is just bugged atm.<br />
<br />
On a side note, Bibi didnt you say you had to push back locks for the shaman vid...but now pops up Paladin...<br />

Butchered. :/ Though the screenshots and this video seem to give it more justice than the other one I saw did (Before Boub posted about it.) and this one seems to show off all it's proper details on the beak which look quite nice. But I'm not a fan of these lazy fire-bird models. Raven Lord was unique till now, besides the fact it had a raptor skeleton that suits it very well so I didn't mind. But now it just looks like 'another boring mount' next to these. And yes I have the mount so I'm mad. xD<br />
<br />
Paladin T12 looks so hilarious on Tauren. Thought about rolling one, completely changed my mind now.<br />

<br />
Other than his very low item level gear, he's freekin bad ass. Why can't all Belf models look this good?<br />

Blizzard say they don't want to change models because players have become attached to how their toons look, but I'm not sure anyone would complain if they made them this good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blue paladin set is my favorite so far even if I'll never get it even on the odd chance it is obtainable to players.<br />
--Paladin tier 12 pants are 3D, little edges come OFF of the characters legs which I think is awesome! (Same with nozdormu's leggings)<br />
--Not the robes though.<br />
<br />
Nozdormu is one handsome dragon in his elf form, ADORE HIS MODEL, it is just plain gorgeous.</div></div><hr />

I must admit that I'm not a big fan of the Fire Raven, I doesn't look bad but I prefer the orginal one. Though it will look awesome on a shadow priest.<br />

Check again, that's not a BE model. And who cares if it's recolored, as long as it looks awesome? +The Tattoo and Beard look great. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder of course, though.</div></div><hr />

Sadly, this means all three will likely require Raid achievements, or at least be raid boss drops.<br />

Must be the trend of 2011. Like Cataclysm is the first expansion using reskins. lalz<br />

i dont see the big deal as if blizzard is the first company to do this. just an example the Ford F150 had the same body style from 97 - 04, 7 years worth of recycled body styles. however it was still one of the most popular trucks.<br />

the point is most people dont realize how much designs are recycled in this world, its just a part of life why keep complaining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;we live in a world of datamining, PTR videos, boss kill addons, and extensive documentation of everything by a very savvy and experienced gaming community.&quot;???<br />
<br />
Datamining - Blizzard's fault;<br />
PTR videos - Blizzard's fault;<br />
Boss kill addons - Not exactly blizzard's fault, but they are there on day 1 thanks to Datamining and PTR;<br />
Extensive documentation - reason 1, 2, 3.<br />
<br />
The amount of info, including heroic mode before even beating the boss on normal mode (Can't update it after the player beat it? No reason to not test heroic modes on PTR anymore, including the final boss that they've always choose to not show to keep it &quot;fresh&quot; on live) is almost saying how to do it. It's not a generic description, it's very detailed.<br />
<br />
Paladin set is nice, the only problem with pants (in every tier that they use pants instead of robes) is that they never get a matching boots and belts for Prot and Ret. Don't know why Blizzard can't just random it every tier so in the end every plate class and their prot/dps spec gets a full set. DPS plate Tier 11 we have 1 trash drop boot, 1 valor boot, 1 359 boss drop bott and 1 372 boss drop boot. Why not choosing one of those to match a paladin set? Why both boss drops and valor are Warrior T11 and trash drop DK T11? Same for DPS plate belts: 1 from Hyjal faction (Why DK???), 1 from Maloriak (DK again), 1 from blacksmith (Warrior) and 1 from Conclave (DK again). Why not giving conclave not only random stats but also random skin, to include the Paladin T11 version?<br />
<br />
They should create the sets in a way that they could share the same belt/boots then. When the sets are totally diferent from each other (like they do for T12) it gets very weird. When the paladin set uses robes instead, the boot problem goes away at least.<br />
<br />
And Nozdormu? For real? Epic :)</div></div><hr />

Yes they use the same base skeleton. That by no means make them a re-skin. Re-using base skeletal features happens in every game, simply because developing a 3D Skeleton takes an enormous amount of time and effort.<br />
<br />

I know, I know. Expected somebody to point that out. But weird as it is - I WAS surprised. Suppose I just couldn't find any downside for once!<br />
<br />
There has never been any 'mystery' unless you havent bothered to alt tab and google, effectively relying on others to carry you through stuff while you 'discover' what kills you. And imo - if the fights a mystery (for everyone except the guilds that did it first) - you're doing it wrong.

That way you still have the 'figuring out' and making it past each phase on a boss without really knowing what is next.<br />
<br />
I think a big part of WoW that has died for long-time players is the mystery and discovery, and rather than struggling to bring that back, Blizz has opted to instead bury it in a shallow grave.<br />
<br />
So Blizzard takes what websites do like Tankspot, wowhead, etc. abilities of bosses does in each phase, Loot drops and put all that information in-game so some people do not have to tab out and search those websites. And that makes WoW's grave any shallower? Have you pug a Dungeon group in the past year or so, wipe on a boss and people get so pissy the group is done for because someone in that group is their first time, or god forbids forgets what every boss in game does. Will the Journal stop people from being jerks, NO. But at least the Game is giving people a tool to read and they do not read it then they are terrible players that want others to carry them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There has never been any 'mystery' unless you havent bothered to alt tab and google, effectively relying on others to carry you through stuff while you 'discover' what kills you. And imo - if the fights a mystery (for everyone except the guilds that did it first) - you're doing it wrong. I've never met anyone over many years of wow that thought diferently :/<br />

During my raiding career, which was TBC/WotLK, I told my GM that I refused to watch videos, and I refused to use DBM/BigWigs. He was okay with it, and I did just fine. I just enjoy the game more that way, I'll read up on tacs to get a vague idea of what I'll be facing, but I think Watching vids and using boss mods sucks the fun out of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like the idea behind it; I just think that we continually ask less of people from the perspective of responding to 'challenges' in-game. <br />
<br />
I also think Blizz went about it the wrong way in Cata, in that you need to gradually build up what you expect from people rather than reversing all of the previous expansions' 'e-z-mode' decisions. <br />
<br />
As developers, Blizz has a lot of power through the leveling process to affect how new players approach the game. They want more inclusion, more people getting into all the game has to offer, but their methods seem to stray too much toward handing it to them , and too little toward building people up to get over the barriers to the gameplay they would have otherwise missed.<br />
<br />
In that sense, the journal feature is a bit of a cop-out in its' current iteration. It says, &quot;There's not enough communication in LFG 5-mans- so we're going to eliminate the need, rather than encouraging it.&quot; You can provide a lot of information to people- just dose it out as they gain the experience to put it in perspective.<br />
<br />
Of course, I primarily tank or heal, so I am used to explaining aspects of fights to newcomers, and I have a bit of patience. It goes a long way.</div></div><hr />

You know debuffs/buffs tell you what they do on the tooltip right? Most top guilds either fraps new progression attempts, or at least screenshot the tooltips for things they need to figure out.<br />

This just eliminates that outside tool usage.<br />

Actually black dragons generally take human form and green usually take night elf form. Arygos and Andergos (blue dragon) turns in to gnomes, chromie (bronze dragon) turns in to a gnome, Caelestrasz (red dragon) turns in to a night elf (not sure why), anachronos (bronze) turns in to a human. <br />
<br />
It's just if you are a big dragon and can turn in to anything, are you going to turn in to some ugly thing or a high elf? eh? ;)<br />

<br />
Actually, it *is* because of their sense of 'pretty'. Most of the dragons prefer to take the shape of Elves when they take on mortal forms, because the Elves are the only 'mortal' race that they (the dragons) can generally identify with (what, with the millenia long lifespans and all). In the end, though, it's a personal choice per dragon, and there *are* some who opt for other forms (Like Kalec or Chromie, to name a few notable examples).<br />
<br />
/lore off<br />

Anyway, I love the new Nozdormu model. Freakin badass right there. Also, WTB that dragon tatoo and another Herod's Shoulder style armor piece to show it off!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pally T12 = AWESOME (except for the helm...the ring of fire is too big)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember having the first raven lord mount on server and people asking what it was and where the hell i got it, now it shouldnt even be considered a &quot;rare mount&quot;, tis a shame imo.<br />
<br />
noz model is dope, would like to see more awesome models like this appear in game. But its funny that its a blood elf in looks on a night elf frame, not sure why blizz does this all the time.</div></div><hr />

I was hoping the red/orange version was going to be the normal version and that the Heroic version was going to be a bit more intricately theamed.</div></div><hr />

So he's a mix between a night elf (looking at how he stands), and a belf if you look at his ears, hair and face ;).<br />
<br />
You even posted pictures and you still can't see that he stands like a Night Elf? Nozdormu is a High Elf with a Night Elf frame.</div></div><hr />

Well, aside from the body posture, could still do with work, but the muscularity is awesome. Reminds me of old Blood Elf concept art. Also, the facial hair is nice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just what the frickin' hell is it about elves that all the aspects absolutely HAVE to take their form? Are they trying to appeal to our sense of pretty?<br />
<br />
Dragons are vain, proud creatures. If they want to take on a mortal form, why use something ugly? I wouldn't...</div></div><hr />

The fire raven lord is pretty neat too. More mounts is always good :P</div></div><hr />

Seriously, why are they recycling one of the last few unique mounts in the game now. It's SO freakin' lazy. Blizzard, you are lazy, and you wonder why you're losing subscribers.<br />
<br />
Seriously, this is too much, too far of them people. And they expect people to pay for premium services on top of a game that you already pay $15/mo for in which most of the assets are blatantly recycled?<br />
<br />
Lazy developers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Noz should have had a goblin form... or maybe troll. Just sayin. :P<br />
<br />
Oh. And, uh, I want that mount. :D<br />
<br />
They're aspects,ofcourse they try and copy a immortal form - elves.<br />
<br />
Deathwing has a human form by the way..</div></div><hr />

During my raiding career, which was TBC/WotLK, I told my GM that I refused to watch videos, and I refused to use DBM/BigWigs. He was okay with it, and I did just fine. I just enjoy the game more that way, I'll read up on tacs to get a vague idea of what I'll be facing, but I think Watching vids and using boss mods sucks the fun out of the game.<br />
<br />
-_-<br />
<br />
But you made your raid leader explain every fight to you instead?<br />
<br />
Also - reading strats is exactly what I was talking about and you just said thats what you did!!! Didnt say vids were necessary. <br />
<br />
And how does your story relate to the actual point of my post in regards to the idiocy of people qqing about a journal with boss mechanics in it? Even if you're not bothering yourself I bet your raid leader didnt just scream WE'RE DOING IT LIVE before you all ran in to discover the mechanics for yourselves. This journal is HELPFUL and doesnt really provide anything we didnt have before through the internet or add ons. It just makes it more accessable.<br />
<br />
Btw personally, and this is only my OPINION I'm not saying other people don't think differently, but I wouldn't want to raid heroic content with anyone who hadn't read up on mechanics and knew all the little tips and tricks that their class can bring to the raid. I don't put the effort in myself just to wipe while someone else is doing it wrong because they couldnt be bothered.</div></div><hr />
