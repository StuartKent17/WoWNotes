Legendaries are 910, mythic gear can proc beyond 880. Had 890 and 895 gear drop for my guild, and that was before the ToV patch.</div></div><hr />

If I remember right, From Scratch were one of the big ones hit by the ban wave. Don't know if it's true and could be rumors, heard Blizzard put their ban in effect right in the middle of third phase of Helya and a huge amount of the core members got banned for exploiting the Artifact Power glitch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some of their players did that fancy artifact power exploit which got them banned so they essentially DQ'ed themselves as a part of their raid team got banned. By disqualified I mean that they can't compete in the raid since they don't have the numbers to do so :p</div></div><hr />

Well it's a 3 boss 'raid', and already widely regarded as overtuned.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't worry too much about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would say that right now only 20 players can make that assertion.<br />
<br />
The raid is most probably overturned. The core rooster of method are close to 895 ilvl in bags 885 equipped, Blizzard is more likely than not to nerf Helya in a few days/weeks.</div></div><hr />

Now they had half their guild banned for exploiting AP mechanics too.<br />

After WF Archimonde by Method in WoD the majority of core Method players left the guild and formed Serenity. Afaik only 3 core members remained with the guild master Sco. I think it was Rogerbrown, Justwait and Perfecto who stayed.</div></div><hr />

The number appears to be the number of Mythic+ they'd need to run to get their 35th trait at their current level of Artifact Knowledge. The checkmarks already have theirs.</div></div><hr />

What a clueless comment. Weve been raiding 16 hours a day since wednesday to make this kill happen. we didnt AP exploit ( All our dungeon runs are recorded on various streams) and it would be impossible for us to kill the boss in one day if we had been waiting out bans. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Artifact rank. Artifact ilvl. Trinkets. # of Legendaries.<br />
<br />
Everything else is pretty irrelevant and &quot;undertune&quot; by comparison.<br />
<br />
All people do for Mythic+ is farm for supercharged relics and trinkets, while hoping for Legendary drops. Blizzard never should've allowed Mythic+ at launch and saved it for down the road as a catchup mechanic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not blaming Method for doing that, they would be stupid not to exploit the &quot;bring the class&quot; bullshit that Blizzard implemented if they want to get world first. I am blaming Blizzard for designing classes and raids in a way that certain specs are clearly favored in certain encounters. <br />
<br />
I am not sure if Method has public logs on this fight, but if they have, you will see that the SPs will have an insane damage output compared to all others. No exploit necessary, it's just Blizzard bad class design (tm)</div></div><hr />

There was a mage, called Qooning. Check wowprogress. <br />
<br />
No Rogue or Monk though and I haven't seen an elemental shaman in a world first kill since MoP but it seems like these things are only an issue when a mage is concerned, even when the accusation is false.</div></div><hr />

My question never stated what they did in the past i'm talking about now and legion. this is 2nd raid content now that just got beat. so nighthold is next which will be 3rd, the way blizzard time-gates everything ap grind etc. it's just pathetic to see stuff die in 1 day-ish. atleast allow it to take 2 resets. <br />

Gratz though, doesnt really change my opinion of the guild after sco went sellout mode, but gratz nontheless. They deserve it.:cool:<br />

I don't exactly get the stigma around selling out, he's trying to make a living out of something he loves to do, isn't that everyone's goal? And Sco clearly loves raiding and the game so let the guy do what he does.</div></div><hr />

you can't take what top guilds do as an idea of how hard the content actually is</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc6818f34952</div><div class="date">2016-11-21, 12:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">you can't take what top guilds do as an idea of how hard the content actually is<br />
<br />
top guilds are no &quot;special players&quot; they are group of people who have proved that they have the time to headbutt a wall until it bricks, while guilds like method does have amazing players. it does not neccesary mean they are the best in the community &quot;Player-wise&quot; thesedays people gets on ptr and learns all strategies more or less that the encounters has to offer, and creates weakauras for them. <br />
<br />
it is said that any succesfull guild atleast has 1 who is good at lua coding.<br />
<br />
So what does this actually mean? It means that the &quot;Top&quot; you are talking about simple are &quot;Great Players&quot; who again and again pulls until it works.<br />
<br />
In legion, you have access to Mythic+, which is something you can do again and again and again.<br />
<br />
Thanks to the streaming world we live in atm via twitch tv. it is easy if a known streamer sets up a &quot;boost run stream&quot; where you keep getting keys to your desired dungeons, and boost them for get some chest loots.<br />
<br />
Since you are not saved you have access to everything. Now Blizzard knowing this released undertuned encounters. Helya is atm the only thing that lasted few days, i wish that she would atleast last 1 or 2 weeks. as in average guild ilvl of 885 or 890. afterall legendaries are now 910 and doing mythic+12 gives 885 ilvl loot,<br />
<br />
this would force method to atleast focus on gear grind for like 1 week and it would make the raid content more healthier.<br />
<br />
i have the following mindset that<br />
<br />
I feel its pathetic to play everyday, to farm every possible ap world quest, to do all the check ups weekly before reset, just so you on patch day beat the living up of released content and then have to look forward to next content already on day 1.<br />
<br />
this seriously struggles me.<br />
<br />
Here I have shared my opinion of the matter, feel free to agree/disagree we are all different after all.</div></div><hr />

I'm not arguing all that bullshit, you me or the other 99.9% of the playerbase aren't gonna 1 clear it in 1 day so it makes no difference if the top guilds manage to clear it. that is absolutely no indication of it's difficulty.</div></div><hr />
