Update - Added new items in a separate post. <br />
<br />
Patch 4.3 - PTR Build 14890 Items (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1008375-Patch-4.3-PTR-Build-14890-Items?p=13879613#post13879613)<br />
<br />
<br />
Update - Added Chromatic Dragon Mount Video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DN3MprbDp6c). <br />
<br />
Taiwan Realms now get Raid Resets twice a week<br />
The new raid lockout changes for Taiwan and Korea adjust the lockout timers for the patch 4.0 and 4.2 raids. The lockout timers for these raids will now reset twice weekly instead of once. These raid lockout changes are being made to allow players to raid more often and get more chances at epic loot drops. Players will be able to down current Cataclysm raid bosses twice a week, accelerating players’ progression.<br />
<br />
We are testing these new raid lockout changes in Taiwan and Korea first. Our goal is to expand this change to other regions in the future, but we don’t have anything further to announce at this time with regard to North American implementation. <br />

It might be problematic for casual raiding guilds however, especially if they decide to implement this for new content, so hopefully they will just use it for older content only.<br />
<br />
2.) That chromatic dragon model is pretty damn awesome, about time they switched it up to something new instead of reused.<br />

Every tier for other classes has always revolved around some theme of the expansion or patch. Firelands creatures/architecture, tiers that look similar to something in a zone, etc. Death Knights are above that. Every tier they get something that goes with their class and stands apart from those other non-Hero classes. t11 - more skulls (did you see those skulls anywhere in cata?). t12 - you can see the architecture of a frost wyrm, with their wings on the helm. So i'm glad they are continuing the trend. (finally a purple/green set that really goes with the scourge WCIII theme)</div></div><hr />

I wonder how they will deal with the change? And why is this being contemplated? Will Mists of Panderia come out soon so there's not a lot of raid time on Dragon Soul? I'd actually prefer that the valor point cap reset twice a week but thats not going to happen. Some guilds are going to be pretty upset that they will be pressured to clear the raids twice a week to max out their chances to get loot to keep up with progression.</div></div><hr />

Uhm, no? They announced they were buffing Blood DK's for next content to make them less prone to one hit KO's at least a month or more ago when discussing tank changes. Correlation is not a sign of causation; these were already a long time coming. =S<br />
<br />
As for skulls on DK tier, something different? Like, fluffy kittens or something unrelated to the death in death knights? ;D</div></div><hr />

Every tier for other classes has always revolved around some theme of the expansion or patch. Firelands creatures/architecture, tiers that look similar to something in a zone, etc. Death Knights are above that. Every tier they get something that goes with their class and stands apart from those other non-Hero classes. t11 - more skulls (did you see those skulls anywhere in cata?). t12 - you can see the architecture of a frost wyrm, with their wings on the helm. So i'm glad they are continuing the trend. (finally a purple/green set that really goes with the scourge WCIII theme)<br />
<br />
This makes me want to facepalm so hard. HERO CLASS MEANS NOTHING. It only means they start out at a higher level, they are not stronger, better, cooler, entitled to anything special, and definitely don't get &quot;cooler&quot; tier sets. Are people that stupid that they believe hero class means anything? It was a marketing ploy to build hype around the release of the death knight class. Nothing more.</div></div><hr />

I wonder how they will deal with the change? And why is this being contemplated? Will Mists of Panderia come out soon so there's not a lot of raid time on Dragon Soul? I'd actually prefer that the valor point cap reset twice a week but thats not going to happen. Some guilds are going to be pretty upset that they will be pressured to clear the raids twice a week to max out their chances to get loot to keep up with progression.<br />
<br />
Agree with this, while it sounds nice on paper, I think there are too many problems that comes with it at the moment. A lot of guilds right now are based on a 1 week cycle. For example, My guild raids twice a week on the weekend friday/saturday. If they make the reset point on tuesday, then we're pretty screwed, because we would miss a whole reset worth of gear basically. Similarly, it would force many guilds to raid twice as much as they are now.</div></div><hr />

I think resetting raids twice a week would be nice, it would give me more options instead of just idling in Orgrimmar/Stormwind. It might be problematic for casual raiding guilds however, especially if they decide to implement this for new content, so hopefully they will just use it for older content only.<br />
<br />
2.) That chromatic dragon model is pretty damn awesome, about time they switched it up to something new instead of reused.<br />
<br />
3.) Blood DK buff :D, I guess they took that guy who QQed about them during Blizzcon seriously.<br />

I'd rather have the original 10/25 lockouts back rather than twice-weekly resets. I hope they scrap the plan. If gear progression is a concern, they could always drop the valor point prices for stuff. &gt;_&gt;<br />

My thoughts exactly.. The last three tiers for DKs have all looked awesome in my opinion (except the helms, but I don't show them anyway), but this one looks kinda plain and not as cool &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
Especially since it took them 45 years to make it and they built it up to be real cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
whatever, at least it's better than most of the rest of the tier 13 sets lol</div></div><hr />

People are getting extremely bored with nothing to do for most of the week these days. Especially with Firelands and now Dragon Soul both being exceptionally short raids. I mean c'mon when Cata came out we got multiple raids with many bosses in each, apart from one which had two. They said they would do this from now on rather than give us just one giant raid like they had been doing with ICC etc. This was a model based off the first tiers of TBC. Then Firelands comes out and they flat out changed their mind and really skimped out big time. They got rid of us having multiple raids with many bosses, but this time they didn't even go back to the one raid only but having it be large design. Now we get one raid and it's medium sized. Some thought it was just for Firelands and now we see it's like that as well with Dragon Soul. I don't understand why they changed their mind on having many raids per patch with few bosses in each and decided upon one raid with a handful of bosses like this. So yeah this is a huge reason why we need raid lockouts to be cut in half. Those who don't wish to raid the extra time don't have to. Those of us who would love to raid twice a week shouldn't be punished by the people who don't wish to raid longer. Oh also that new drake is indeed amazing looking. Too bad I can't say the same for the DK tier set. Looks like the new warrior PVP set in a way. Uglyyyyyy at least imo.</div></div><hr />

While this seems pretty awesome, it's still basically saying that if we as Elemental shamans want to be viable DPS we will still need to retain 2 pieces of our tier 12.

However this is obviously a new type of Chromatic Dragon unlike any we've seen before. The golden color reminds me of the Dragon Soul and how the Aspects power appeared when they united against Deathwing. This is some sort of harmonious fusion of the Dragonflight's powers.<br />
<br />
It's Captain Planet versus the older ones Frankenstein's monster. But they're still both technically Chromatics that combine the traits of all of the Flights, the manner in which they combine them is very different however.</div></div><hr />

Nothing will force you. Besides what's the difference whether you run the raid twice a week on 2 chars or twice on the same char?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In my mind, I associate Chromatic Dragon with Tiamat (5 headed dragon goddess from DnD, one head each of red, blue, green, black, and white), her opposite number is Bahamut the Platinum Dragon.<br />
<br />
I'm actually thinking of Dragonlance dragons here and it gets even more confusing. In Ansalon, chromatic dragons are &quot;base colour dragons&quot; (red, blue, green, black and white) and metallic dragons are.. well, gold, silver, bronze etc. So this is definitely a metallic dragon! Rawr. :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Riboflavin</div><div class="date">2011-10-26, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's most likely called Chromatic as that's a lot shorter to name the model in the files than Soul of the Aspects for the pet and Heart of the Aspects for the mount. The pet/mount names sounds like a culmination of all the dragon aspects(maybe not the black fight*cough*) thus they are chromatic in origin, and not to be confused with the mutant magical atrocities that Deathchin and his ilk created.</div></div><hr />

Wish we knew what that one looked like. Can't be worse. Like the Chromatic Dragon very much, I'm fine it being gold, I mean, seriously, whatever, doesn't make much more or less sense than them being purple, as they were till now. I'm damn curious where we get this one though. It has a distinct Asian look imo so Mists of Pandaria? Why is it already in the game files then though? Or can we take Metzen's &quot;big things going down literally and figuratively in 4.3&quot; as an idea? Such as ... The Five Flights decide to attempt something truly extraordinary - magically merging their flights into one big, chromatic flight. No longer will only one Aspect be responsible for Life, one for Time, one for the deep Earth etc. but all of them. They already had their bit working together like a unit in Thrall - Twilight of the Aspects, maybe they just decide to take it one step further, especially given that there's no new Black Dragon to become the Aspect of Earth (that they can trust - yet). End their differences and become one. Maybe this chromatic dragon is this Heart of the Aspects mount. I think the Blazing Drake will look different, all their &quot;Blazing&quot; mounts have flames in some way. I look at this chromatic dragon and maybe its flight like this ... Deathwing tried to forcefully merge the flights into a chromatic dragonflight, he was corrupted etc. This would be the pure version of this, the dragonflights unifying.</div></div><hr />

Uhh no shit? The guy you're quoting and trying to make stupid has a point which obviously flew over your head. What he was saying was that having the raid lockouts expire twice a week would be good so he could raid MORE and do more. Extending a raid lock out after you already kill every boss isn't going to give him more to do like he's wanting....<br />

The DK tier looks good but it looks to me like it's based very strongly on the warrior S11 gear that they released a couple of weeks ago... I'm a little disappoint :P<br />
<br />
I'm guessing Should of the Aspects is the Chromatic Drake pet because it's a pet and an instant cast, so I'll assume that the Heart of the Aspects is the flying chromatic drake mount... interesting, given the description of 'This mount changes depending on your riding skill and location,' it kinda looks like this will be a pet store or a TCG card mount...</div></div><hr />

Rawr. :D<br />
<br />
The metallic/chromatic divide between dragons actually comes from Dungeons and Dragons. Ansalon/Dragonlance was a Campaign Setting for that game system, and it's very clear that they pinched Tiamat (renamed Takhisis) and Bahamut (renamed Paladine) from the Deities and Demigods book (I think it was, it was later rereleased as Legends and Lore). Sure, they made some alterations (Takhisis is CE while Tiamat is LE, for example), but they're essentially the same.<br />
<br />
Red, Blue, Green, Black, and White have always been the five colours of the evil dragons, going back even as far as Basic Dungeons and Dragons.<br />
Gold, Silver, Bronze, Brass, and Copper were the colours of the good dragons. It is actually rather straight forward, IMHO.<br />
<br />
ETA: Given that Blizzard also seems to have the same idea (switched up a little, but basically 5 different colours, with different &quot;breath weapons&quot; and alignments), I wouldn't be terribly surprised to find that it predates Dungeons and Dragons as well.</div></div><hr />

And really? Things are that bad that we need 2 lockouts per week now? Are we really that gear driven? Another way to inflate the lack of content, just like normal + heroic &quot;Firelands is 14 bosses!&quot; crap? Heroic races now at the launch? LOL<br />
<br />
There was a reason ppl asked to not raid 10+25 anymore. Ppl complaining that is not good to raid 4,5,6 days a week and now Blizzard is forcing them to do so? LOL. Ppl will be pressured to raid more just like they did get with 10+25, except that one could argue that 10man gear was crap and you could roflstomp the easier 10man with the better 25man gear, but now they're the same. Guilds are setup for 1 raid per week, 2 days, 3 days, etc. Increasing that to 6 days does not help. Not when you're forced to do so on the same character. LFR is alread there for twice a week raiding in a way that does not force guilds to put their members in such a pressure. Members in your guild who can raid 6/7 days per week will always be better (and get spots) than the others who could run the current schedule.<br />
<br />
Want something better Blizzard? Separated locks for Normal and Heroic like ToC. Worth more than forcing ppl to raid twice a week no matter what. No pressure for clearing normal while discussing giving up trying a heroic mode or not, just because you need to clear it on normal. That will help the game way more than 6/7 days of raiding.<br />
<br />
Unless we're getting more content fast (new Tier every 3 months or less), no need to fast foward stuff that much, want to nerf the entire content 1 month after it's release and now packing those 6 months worth of raiding into this 1/2 month(s) thanks to the new nerf philosophy?

People are getting extremely bored with nothing to do for most of the week these days. Especially with Firelands and now Dragon Soul both being exceptionally short raids. I mean c'mon when Cata came out we got multiple raids with many bosses in each, apart from one which had two. They said they would do this from now on rather than give us just one giant raid like they had been doing with ICC etc. This was a model based off the first tiers of TBC. Then Firelands comes out and they flat out changed their mind and really skimped out big time. They got rid of us having multiple raids with many bosses, but this time they didn't even go back to the one raid only but having it be large design. Now we get one raid and it's medium sized. Some thought it was just for Firelands and now we see it's like that as well with Dragon Soul. I don't understand why they changed their mind on having many raids per patch with few bosses in each and decided upon one raid with a handful of bosses like this. So yeah this is a huge reason why we need raid lockouts to be cut in half. Those who don't wish to raid the extra time don't have to. Those of us who would love to raid twice a week shouldn't be punished by the people who don't wish to raid longer. Oh also that new drake is indeed amazing looking. Too bad I can't say the same for the DK tier set. Looks like the new warrior PVP set in a way. Uglyyyyyy at least imo.<br />
<br />
Do something else, there are other things to do even in WoW. But go play other games, do something else about your life other than staying logged in WoW the entire day.<br />
<br />
Even that way, go raid with your alt if you have that much free time. But don't ask to f%¨&amp; others.</div></div><hr />

So what you do is just EXTEND THE RAID LOCKOUT. Now people that want to raid twice a week on one toon can and those that don't can keep to their regular raid times. It will also probs equal more pugs. So quit acting like this will affect anything at all</div></div><hr />

What extending it has to do with killing the same boss twice a week?<br />
<br />
You're not looking cool saying that, just stupid.<br />
<br />
You can't kill 7/7n, so it's worth killing shannox twice a week than to make up for that? LOL.<br />
<br />
If this won't affect anything, why change then? Right?<br />
<br />
LFR is there to fix it for you bro.</div></div><hr />

It affects the people that want this change but doesn't affect the people that don't want it. So why you are complaining about it I really don't understand <br />
<br />
It's got to do with the fact you are bitching about how it's an unneeded feature that people don't want to kill those bosses twice a week. The fact is some people do. Also about me trying to look cool or whatnot I don't see how that is relevant to anything at all? <br />
<br />
To some people that can't get 7/7 killing shannox twice is something worthwhile. About extending the raid lockout I said that to point out people aren't being forced to raid more it's just giving people that want to raid more on their mainsore opportunities to do so. People aren't the same as you are</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still not looking cool bro.<br />
<br />
Things need a common ground, they changed the 10+25 for a reason and 10+25 was better than this new one since 10man were a joke as you could roflstomp it with 25man gear, dropped worse gear (so you could just keep doing your 1 25man per week and stay on the same pace as ppl raiding 10+25, so no replacing you for not being able to raid 10+25 and staying behind on gear progression) and all.<br />
<br />
If you check, there will be ppl who wants 3 or more lockouts per week. Didn't you see that a few ppl got sad that they couldn't just spam non-stop LFR for drops? There will be always someone who wants more than you. So, not a good reason to change it just because someone in the entire world wants it. They are tired of saying that they go for the marjority, not minority anymore. The marjority wanted more content, not the same little content twice a week. More lockouts is not the answer for the problem.<br />
<br />
Ppl are being forced to raid with the current model if this new lockout is implemented and the content is getting burned faster at this pace. Raiding Firelands (or the current) more will not solve your boredom problem. If they want to implement that for older tiers, so ppl can join the current one faster, ok. But forcing ppl to raid the current more and more won't solve anything.<br />

<br />
Extending raid has no impact on that matter.<br />
<br />
Extending make you loose 2 weeks dude, and with that system, 4 lockouts instead.<br />
<br />
Extending is for working on a boss to kill it. Not to spread your schedule. You raid on your weekend, you go there and clear it. Now you go back next weekend and extend it, gratz, you just doing nothing that week while others are doing it for the 4th time. Way to go.<br />
<br />
Again, the answer for your specific time is on 4.3: LFR.</div></div><hr />

It is a mixture of Lichking Armor and the various experiences the Death Knights have gained along the way. It is plainly superior to everything we have had before.<br />
<br />
The fact that anyone could complain because it &quot;took so long&quot; insinuates that because it took long, you thought it would be super mega-amazing and the definitive Tier gear for all classes *ever*. I want to assure you that you will never see a Tier set that matches these standards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, and came to the conclusion that no, not enough ppl want this change. If they did, no reason to start in (guess why) places where ppl are more prone to farm non-stop. They're shooting everywhere to keep their customers and they'll check if this does the trick for the lack of content.<br />
<br />
I don't think the wotlk model was better, it was just as crap as this new twice per week. Just way easier to say &quot;no, I don't want to do it and it's not needed nor will affect my performance on 25&quot;.<br />
<br />
Wanna see the magic of two-way road? Thinking that everyone wants to raid the same more and nobody will be forced to it is just your opinion.<br />
<br />
This is a multiplayer game, this is a MMO, not a single player game. If it was just like that, nobody would give a crap about it. But you need others to acomplish it and others need you. As long as someone thinks that is the way to go, you're screwed and just need to leave.<br />
<br />
As ppl alread said, the game, community, guilds and all are setup for 1 lockout per week. Adding another lockout of the same level isn't just a &quot;fun thing do to when bored and having nothing to do with your life other than WoW on that same character&quot;. Any guild that wants progression (of any kind, not only the last heroic boss of the patch) will be heavly impacted by it.<br />
<br />
What happened with the mentality of &quot;you can play anytime you want and not get screwed&quot;? Why are we able to do all of our 7 heroics of the week in one day instead of the old forced 1 per day for all the 7 days of the week? Because then you can play when you can and not stay behind others just because they can log every day to do their daily randoms. It's the same for raid. We get one lock out because it needs 10 or 25 players to group together at a given time to try it. You have the entire week to get the best schedule for the group without screwing it because you're loosing lockouts for not being able to have all the 10/25 3h or 4h a day the entire week. <br />
<br />
Stop thinking about you and start thinking about the game and the community as a whole. Who will pick you with your once a week schedule if there is someone who can show up for both raids and gearing hell faster than you? See one of the problems? See how you're getting forced to raid twice even if you're not &quot;on top world guild&quot;?</div></div><hr />

I don't see how this is a negative thing.<br />
<br />
Again, LFR will be there for you. The game is not centered around raid pugs. This is the only audience who can /cheer at this change and right now they're not the marjority anymore since Blizzard changed to focus to guilds. For this audience, if they could just spam the current raid non-stop as they can the heroics in LFD, would be great and the best thing ever.<br />
<br />
And you're not even taking into account WHEN the raid will unlock. It can just unlock in the middle of your raiding schedule. Would be fun to find half of your group somehow locked and unable to raid right on the exactly time frame everyone can raid together? LOL huh? Now you have to join their lockout (if they didn't clear it) or pug others in their place, raid 1 less day, etc. These problems won't show up if you raid twice on diferent characters for example. You satiate your lust for purples and raiding non-stop without compromissing others.<br />
<br />
See how many problems will show up? Sometimes it's up to Blizzard to set something to prevent more cons than pros. Even the worst decision ever made in the world, there will be someone who will find something good came with that decision, someone who will get something good for them out of that, wich does not mean it's the way to go. It's common place for everyone to work on it. This time they're failing their job. Don't believe that with this change, things will remain the same, most ppl will not raid twice, etc. The &quot;1 raid only&quot; players will become minority, because most guilds will get around into a way to raid twice to keep competitive and progressing and their players to hold their raiding spots. If you're unable to join the &quot;raiding twice&quot; bandwagon, you're just screwed trying to find a guild that only raid once.</div></div><hr />

This was my thought as well. It's GORGEOUS. The gold and armor style and widely different style of dragon head definitely make me think it's Pandaria-based.<br />

I hope they release the blue and purple though...the red doesn't quite sit right with me. they should have rendered a green instead imo. that way the people hoping for a &quot;diseased based&quot; set can have something to cheer about. but then again...they have green gear in the heroic tier 12.the dragon mount...finally a new model that doesn't resemble everything else or a reskinning of a model *cough* the mount off rag *cough*...*cough* reskinned proto-drake *cough*it would be nice if they reduced the lockout timer for the home servers first. i wouldn't mind getting some of my alts into the raids twice a week.</div></div><hr />
