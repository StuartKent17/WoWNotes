Some of them probably weren't. PTR and live servers are entirely different environments, especially in terms of scale and stress. Also, 1 day of downtime won't kill you. Trust me, it's happened before and I'm perfectly fine!...*twitch*</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not what I'm even saying.. A day of down time would have been perfectly understandable. But it was just a few hours. Why even have a PTR if bugs aren't going to be found out and anticipated? I would have gladly accepted a day of downtime, it would have meant it wouldn't have been rushed, like it so obviously was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A lot of the technical issues probably still wouldn't have been found because of the difference between testing environments(where it's pretty difficult to simulate the stress thousands of people put on a single server, all doing very different things, especially when not that many people use the PTR overall) and live servers(where all the bigger bugs that were hiding show up). Code is an unforgiving bitch.<br />
<br />
The raid-based bugs are probably there because they probably weren't tested by more than 10 people during PTR(it was irrelevant to the testing, so why bother?).<br />
<br />
There's really no excuse for the Death Knight runes though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of people on PTR is there to test their class buff or nerf few are testing for bugs<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably not too far off but we haven't been able to reproduce the situation yet on our internal servers, which is a necessary step in pinpointing the issue. There's definitely something wrong, it's just finding the catalyst and then devising a solution. Rest assured there are many people working overnight to resolve this and other issues.<br />
<br />
Like last post said and blizzard confirm here. Live servers are way different then ptr or their internal server.<br />
Live server have huge ppl trying to log at same time trying to explore same new things stressing server and making it bug. Also ppl don't use half of addons or Hardware on ptr to realy test it. Ptr client is a fresh copy not a update over updates making wierd errors between client-server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At least Blizzard has tech support working around the clock on these issues. It's only a couple of hours. We can all live without WoW for a couple of hours.<br />
<br />
If you can't, please, take up reading. Go outside and breathe some fresh air. Anything. Don't complain and rant and rave about a company that cares enough to bring you new content, pay its workers overtime to stabilize everything ASAP, and want you to enjoy your gaming experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Patch wasn't rushed - they have a really good quality management looking into each patch they test. There may be times when some patches won't make it into the final version or (most likley), won't work like they should be.<br />
<br />
WoW has a massive code base right now and you can't just &quot;fiddle&quot; a bit around, to get things done. Worked once for a smaller company with an ERP/CRM System with a good and not-so-small software. If you canged even a tiny bit of code, you had to think about all posibilities that could happen or have to be covered. And to be honest - about 80% at the time, we had something forgotten in the abyss of the code and some things went wrong. Some things you don't see when testing the function or the user using it in a different way.<br />
<br />
Same with the latency issue. The PTR are 2-3 Server System - think most of them just one blade unit and an SAS Storage behind.<br />
<br />
The REAL Servers are a MASSIVE System with workload share, Clustering, big networks etc. pp. - it's a whole different level then the ptr - just read up a bit about clustering, the options, big networks and you will have your brain hurting after some times just READING about.<br />
<br />
And those &quot;new&quot; latency issues are a bitch to find ... there are many possibilities where it could go wrong <br />
<br />
So even with more time, the patch wouldn't be better, because some problems just come with a huge player base and a really big system ;)</div></div><hr />

another patch full of BUGS,BUGS and more BUGS. You would think that after all these years. We would be use to a patch that messes up and makes the game hard to play. Does Blizz care NOPE why cause you keep giving them your money. Will it get better.....NOPE will you keep giving them your money...YEP And also a way to tell that blizz does not really care about what they put out...HOTFIXES Almost everyday HOTFIXES and changes to how we play the game.<br />

then they shouldn't be blowing what little disposable income they might have on a game. I mean unless their goal is to stay flat broke and busted then I guess WoW would be a worthwhile money sink afterall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To TEST the game? See the keyword? If you're thinking these are the only bugs found, maybe you should go onto a PTR yourself and see what the game is like then. I recall the Beta, Worgens looked more like Zombies, some spells wouldn't work and well, goodluck gearing to 85.</div></div><hr />

Why? Because of the sheer number of people on live compared to PTR, all doing things differently from each other, in ways that may not have even been touched during testing.<br />
<br />
Having worked at a software company, deploying 'patches' to a customer system then seeing problems crop up that I hadn't even seen coming, I can understand this. I'd rather wait a few more hours or whatever, and have a stable system to play on, than not.</div></div><hr />

People who are living in poverty do not spend 15 bucks a month on WoW. And if they do, then they need to be sterilized and taken off any Government benefits they receive.</div></div><hr />

Don´t make excuses for Blizzard having piss poor test environments. They could easily simulate the stress of 20k logons with bots. It´s a matter of a crappy QA department and them just using live realms as test beds because they are lazy and incompetent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would I feel ashamed? There is nothing at all repulsive about that statement. People who are living in poverty should not be spending money on World of Warcraft and seeing as in 2009 92% of the population living below the poverty line were on some form of government benefits, there's a good chance you're paying for one of those people to play WoW.<br />
<br />
Now, there's a big difference between living paycheck to paycheck and generally being broke and living in poverty. The original statement was living paycheck to paycheck, I replied to someone commenting about people living in poverty. If you live paycheck to paycheck and find money to pay for WoW, more power to you. If you live in poverty, which again means there's a 90% chance that you're receiving some sort of government benefits in 2009(the last year I could find the statistics for), and are wasting money on WoW then you are nothing but a drain on society.</div></div><hr />

How many people actually play PTR? I'm usually the only one in my guild (over the last two expansions) and I do it only about half the time. So 1 out of 25 consistently. I'm gonna take a wild guess and say that 10+ other people who are new to the game don't either. So I'm going to say (safely) 1 out of 35. So 35 times the amount of people who play PTR log on to live. So (roughly) 35 times the man hours of finding bugs and 35 times (I know this isn't accurate) the server load/stress of PTR. Now you can blame Blizzard for not fixing stuff found early in PTR, but you can't blame them for zero day bugs that need fixes.</div></div><hr />

Def agree with you buddy. <br />
<br />
It drives me insane always seeing &quot;blizz doesnt care about this and that and they just want our money period.&quot; They HAVE to care to some degree with soem of the posts that GC has posted relatively recently tryign to explain their side of things. They have to care that once this patch came out they had multiple ppl working tail over trying to get things fixed ASAP, yet 99% of the ppl that play don't understand the tech that goes on behind the scenes and thus get pissy because they pay 15 a month to have apparently everythign perfect. Coding, networking... anything electronic in general theres always something that can/will go wrong, anticipated or not. Just be glad they care enough to fix the bugs as quick as they can, or even that they want to continue producing content for people to enjoy. <br />

On the flip side you could have spent 40 bucks on Vanilla, be paying $15 a month, and still be playing Vanilla 5 years later.</div></div><hr />
