Throne of Thunder LFR Opens Another Wing Today<br />
Don't forget that another section of the Throne of Thunder LFR will open today (http://us.battle.net//wow/en/blog/8789565)! AskMrRobot has a nice blog post up about how to spend your bonus rolls and what all of the output means. <br />
<br />
You can find the encounter journal and loot tables for the next 3 bosses on the pages linked below, and boss guides over at Icy Veins (http://www.icy-veins.com/throne-of-thunder-raid-wow). <br />

Patch 5.3 PTR Changes Clarifications<br />
Tonight's PTR build demonstrated why you should always wait before complaining about changes. We can only report changes made to the tooltips, so when tooltips are not updated completely you don't get the full story. Ghostcrawler was nice enough to address some of the concerns anyway!<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Character<br />
In vanilla, having an alt was very difficult. In Cataclysm it was very easy. We're just shifting things back a tiny bit. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314828066474053633))<br />
and that sucks. Making me drift from the game.<br />
That's not our goal. But there is a fine line between &quot;my alt is too hard to play&quot; and &quot;I have nothing to do on my alt.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314827941051768832))<br />
Also not our intent, but we don't want everyone to be at 11 maxed out alts on their account with nothing to do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314828878696820737))<br />
<br />
Might surprise you, but a lot of people find professions fun. Need to tune out the instant gratification crowd.<br />
I think the question is: would you have the prof alts if your main could do all profs? Do you like the professions or the alts? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314176347272519680))<br />
so leveling in mop is so boring and painfull to disourage us from having too many professions?common<br />
Not sure how you concluded that from my comments. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314774806333624320))<br />
he's arguing, rightly, that you've expressed you don't want players to have autonomous access to all profs.<br />
He's arguing with some strange cart and horse placement. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314781293701382144))<br />
you're the one who so often says all players' input has some value, no? Isn't his point apparent, if not eloquent?<br />
He was attempting to use my discussion of professions to argue that we made mop leveling &quot;boring and painful.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314826890546409473))<br />
Would not be first time you've wanted more player(LFR) interdependence(LFR) than players(LFR) want(LFR).<br />
Not the word I would use. IMO WoW is most fun when it's enjoyed socially. We worry the solo LFR guy won't be a long-term player. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314830164087431168))<br />
Funny how you have removed all the social aspects from the game then, if you want people to enjoy it that way.<br />
We worked hard to give players a lot to do, which was important. But I agree it came at a social expense. Next problem to solve. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315145763502034945))<br />
<br />
I don't want to quest on the alt. Way things are set up, dailies feel mandatory<br />
But questing is a big part of the game. You do have options (such as dungeons or PvP) but they aren't designed to be as efficient. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314885058399961089))<br />
<br />
I understand your reasons you want give single chars a lot to do. Thats great. But that does not mean you need to punish alts<br />
The purpose of having an alt, for us, is to play them. Too many catch-up mechanics means you don't have to play them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314828177853792257))<br />
But does that mean you need to repeat every single accomplishment the player already did?<br />
No, and you generally don't have to. Things like commendations, heirlooms and even making bags for your alt give you a big leg up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314830450608709633))<br />
But repeating double gate removals and reputations grinds burns out players. Why aren't those brick walls account specific?<br />
Because then your alt doesn't have to quest. You earn valor and then get another raid-geared character. And then what? Make a 3rd? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314831417316093952))<br />
Really, this is not to annoy you. I appreciate your work. But.. alts aren't the target group of mop as it seems<br />
No, it's cool. I'm just trying to unravel the apparent paradox of wanting to have an alt but not wanting to have to play that alt. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314833893842878464))<br />
you define play here very differently than many. I'll endure a grind for my main, but alts are for fun, and grinding sucks.<br />
I'll counter that with &quot;grind&quot; is a word players use when they want the rewards but not the steps it takes to get them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314884229613887488))<br />
I honestly don't understand this response. Are you saying people upset about the grind are whiners?<br />
I'm saying &quot;grind&quot; is a pejorative word that has a mushy definition and tends to get overused. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315146678527221760))<br />
Well then what kind of conversation can we have? I can't call a duck a duck without it being apparently a pejorative term.<br />
Some words just lose their meaning through careless use. Grind is one of them, along with clunky, scaling and benched. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315149054969536513))<br />
and Epic. Your company really needs to stop using Epic. It's in he same teir as this other words you describe<br />
It's true. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315488574315311105))<br />
<br />
Could there be a sliding scale, so toon#3 took less time than toon#2, toon#4 less than toon#3, for altoholics?<br />
Yeah, honestly, that's more of what we're going for. Just trying to figure out that scale. 50% of the time of the first? 10%? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315146887571333120))<br />
<br />
It's not about not playing it, it's about the burden to repeat everything that the player already did.<br />
But isn't that what an alt is all about - replaying the game through a different view? Otherwise we could just offer class respec. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314885296854532097))<br />
Mounts are a great example. They are account shared.<br />
Yes, and so are achievements. Rep could be, or even valor, loot or char level, but at some point you'll have nothing left to do. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315148590454546432))<br />
Why should a char level not be at 90 automatically? Because i learn the class on leveling it. I need to find out how it works<br />
Not sure how important that is anymore. Respec Feral to Balance is a big difference. Also many spells have less use at low level. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315210389195485184))<br />
<br />
catchup mechs are not &quot;play&quot;, work. Without loot as carrot, raiders would play,so would(and do)gladiators. Who'd daily or lfr?<br />
Disagree. Many raiders would stop without loot as a carrot. Players tend not to do activities that have no loot incentive. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314884722478153729))<br />
Part of that is on us to come up with rewards besides loot, but loot is still the most proven effective reward. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/314884831613956098))<br />
glads do. Point is lfr and dailies are endured for loot; raiding is -fun-.<br />
Consider that we could have made WoW a game about running instances or even raids. We didn't. There are reasons for that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/315146359231623168))<br />

SC2 Situation Report - April 1, 2013<br />
Blizzard replaced the worker units (SCVs, Drones, Probes) with the removed Warhound model today in SC2! Thanks to ShadowRaven6 (http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1bel83/workers_have_changed_to_this_for_april_fools/) for the image.<br />
As you may know, the Warhound was removed very early in the Heart of the Swarm public beta test because we felt that its role overlapped with the Marauder a bit too much. Mechanically, these two units were virtually identical, but were produced from two different buildings. It’s never an easy decision to remove a unit, but this decision was particularly tough because we absolutely loved the Warhound’s art.<br />
<br />
After watching the MLG Winter Championship, we noticed that Life was able to beat Flash a little too easily in the finals. Had Flash been able to build Warhounds, our favorite race (Terran) may have won the tournament. As usual, we made a spur-of-the-moment decision based on this match and immediately set about rebalancing the game.<br />
<br />
Accordingly, we reintroduced the Warhound into our internal builds for testing purposes. It felt great to have the Warhound back when we played as Terran, but when we played against them using our favorite race (Zerg), it somehow felt very wrong. Obviously, we couldn’t have that, so we decided that we must also give the Warhound to Zerg.<br />
<br />
After putting some more thought into it, we realized that our favorite race (Protoss) was getting the short end of the stick because it was the only race without the Warhound. That’s when it came to us: Protoss should have it as well, since one of our main goals in StarCraft II was to create as much symmetry as possible amongst all three races.<br />
<br />
So after considering every angle, here’s what’s changing:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Warhound has been added for Terran because robots are cool and the art is amazing<br />
The Warhound has been added for Zerg to remain competitive with Terran.<br />
The Warhound has been added for Protoss to keep Protoss players from whining about them on the forums.<br />
<br />

<br />
While we know these changes are drastic, we encourage everyone to log in and spend some time playing before rushing to judgment. We welcome you to share your thoughts, but this time around we’re not going to be listening to feedback.<br />
<br />
For more information on the story behind the Warhound please check out the Warhound Q&amp;A (https://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/9369236/Blizzard_Creative_Development_Warhound_QA-3_31_2013) and the latest entry in our StarCraft short story series “Command Performance (https://us.battle.net/sc2/en/blog/9369229/New_StarCraft_Short_Story_Command_Performance-3_28_2013)”.<br />

As for the issue about alts that Blizzard does not get, for many of us their raid/heroic usage is no different than having a second talent spec. I myself am more than willing to do the work to get to 90, but damn if I want to spend the full grind getting ready to raid on a second character or more. I think justice points need to be account wide. That would make alt gearing easier without giving away the house. Throw some automatic bleed over in reputation points and voila, problem solved.</div></div><hr />

Sadly, it won't get fixed because that skeleton with the derpy hoof, is also on Invincible and the Celestial Steed. While I am not sure about the former I do know that the Celestial Steed also has that same broken foot flop going on. ;x<br />

Seriously... They need to sit down, and make the Headless Horseman's mount have a clone, and add a wing mesh to it, so Tyrael's Charger, Invincible, Celestial Steed, and these Pegasus could look less like rubberized bad renditions of double jointed, stubby-legged horses, and more like the mind shattering awesome creatures they are actually intended to be! I would LOVE the Pegasus, and while I will want to get one, I doubt I will ride it much at all because of the fubar'ed flight animation. Invincible is the only mount that semi-hides the severe brokenness of the skeleton it is on, due to being armored in the way it is, and half rotted. The Pegasus fixes the missing back end of the hooves that all of the prior models have, but... it's not enough.</div></div><hr />

Most people cant see what is wrong the current one, but I'll gladly tell you: You gave the animation of the hippogryph to all these kind of winged horse mounts. Problem is that they have shorter legs, than horses supposed to have, and they move their legs very differently. A horse's hoof should never swing back and forth like that when it is flying or running!<br />
Why?<br />
Because this way it looks like a retarded pony!<br />
<br />
I would LOVE all these mounts, the Celestial steed, the Invincible, and of course these new ones! But now i only see the them as a group of mounts, that could be sooooooooo much more awesome, but blizz didnt have the time/energy/will to create a new animation for them. And that saddens me greatly. I 've been hoping that they will be fixed someday, since i first saw a mount like this in Wrath of the Lich King, but now i realize, they wont.. Retarded ponies are not my type.<br />
Details can make a great game an awesome game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Consider your typical 90 in the game...Unless you RP or spend a LOT of time in SMC or Exodar how do you get around? You fly. I understand where you're coming from, really, I do; but keep in mind the thought processes behind most capped players: &quot;I want convenience!&quot; If they were to offer just a plain old ground mount nobody would REALLY want it all that much because there aren't enough constant situation in WoW where you can only be on a grounded mount. PvP and the few instances/parts of raids where you can mount up aside - in today's game flying mounts are really the only way to make anything appealing to the mass of players now.<br />
<br />
That said - where the hell do you even get those mounts?<br />
<br />
Also - WHAT IS WITH THE STUMPY FUCKING HORSE LEGS?! I really want to know why the hell Blizzard keeps using these horse models. They have short, stocky, little legs - reminds me of those shetland ponies or whatever they're called. When I see horses I see long, lean, legs...FIXXXXX IT!</div></div><hr />

Also, the position of the wings shifts the central point of gravity, which would in turn cause the body to tilt upwards like it was climbing a steep hill.. They need to be shifted behind the shoulders, not infront on the neck (which looks more like a giraffe neck than a horse neck, goddam was this thing inbred with camels?)</div></div><hr />
