Warlords of Draenor - Upcoming Beta Additions<br />
It looks like upcoming beta builds (next week (https://twitter.com/ckaleiki/status/489208570756362240)) will give us Gorgrond, Talador, and Ashran!<br />
<br />
<br />

Warlords of Draenor - 7/15 Beta Invite Wave<br />
A sizable invite wave went out tonight, allowing many more people to join the beta testing for Warlords of Draenor. Bashiok also explained a little bit more about how invite targeting works.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/betaWaves.png (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/status/489134331621699585) <br />
<br />
Targeting was at subscription length + recent activity of accounts who are (of course) opted in to beta test on the website. So account creation date wasn't necessarily a factor, although of course those with a lot of sub time also have old accounts. Also it was a target and not a guarantee, and so certainly not everyone who has been playing a long time got one.<br />
<br />
But more are going out to opt-ins every week, and there are fansite and gaming news site giveaways. Plenty of additional opportunities every week.<br />
<br />

Warlords of Draenor - Holiday Updates<br />
Muffinus hinted (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/489212646680313857) that holidays may see some changes or updates in Warlords of Draenor.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
does everyone get a base multistrike %? Don't have beta yet so can't test<br />
No, no global base amount. A few specs have passives which some though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486984248239202304))<br />
...which *grant* some. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486984348726358016))<br />
<br />

also also about mirror images. Giving mages an ability we've had for years as a lvl90 talent isn't fun or exciting gameplay.<br />
It does like 3000% more damage now though! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487124787219947520))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E))<br />
Will a warrior have to commit to glad stance before a bg starts?<br />
In its current implementation, yes. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486692395853950978))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
Is Rating -&gt; % conv. going to be the same for Crit and Multistrike? If so, it feels like Crit will always be numerically better.<br />
Nope. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486578932733337600))<br />
Good to know. Are we going to see Multistrike Damage bonuses (&gt; 30%) the way we do with Crit? (&gt; 100/50%)<br />
Yes, but they're very rare. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/486580609829969921))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Is it realistic to expect we will frequently switch gemming and enchanting, esp given stat attunements?<br />
The average player? Maybe not. A top 10 guild tank doing progression? Wouldn't surprise me at all. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/486553679156109312))<br />
<br />
With most ench/gem/reforg gone, how do we promote build diversity aside for drop RnG. It's fairly important during progression.<br />
But enchanting and gemming aren't gone? Also flask/food is a good chunk of secondary stats - you can make large stat adjustments. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/486547707033432064))<br />
I was under the (misguided maybe?) impression that available enchants and gem slots are severely reduced in WoD?<br />
They're consolidated into fewer slots, so you can wear more gear instantly, but each enchant you do have is more impactful. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/486554000611753985))<br />
<br />
In other words, will heroic dungeon gear be powerful enough for normal mode Highmaul?<br />
Absolutely. Normal Highmaul is tuned for Heroic dungeon blues, and Normal Highmaul will be open before LFR. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487307632336568322))<br />
Question, is that Normal which is &quot;Flex&quot; now, or &quot;Normal&quot; right now?<br />
If I ever talk about Warlords raids, I'm using the 6.0 difficulty names. So, the former. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487348672955285505))<br />
Follow-up inquiry, what is Heroic Highmaul tuned for?<br />
&quot;Tuned for&quot; can be misleading. Tuned to be done in Normal Highmaul gear by the audience for which Heroic is the likely endpoint. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487353582153256960))<br />
But Mythic-caliber raiders should be quite able to do Heroic Highmaul without much/any Normal gear. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/487353794821246977))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Any chance at getting a few more bgs for low levels, random bgs xp &lt;3<br />
Actually yes! We are going to redistribute when battlegrounds come available. More at lower level. Also Random BG at level 20. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486708244673355776))<br />
<br />
I don't play much. I did however start at release and saw the game wither away since Cata.<br />
Arena participation grew 50% over the course if the expansion. Not dead, growing. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486510623522447360))<br />
<br />
constant new rewards take resources. motivation at top end is a recognition issue, maybe in game ladder UI to show off?<br />
Definitely thinking about ways to improve rewards and progression in PvP. Any change would need to be clearly better. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486539455558213634))<br />
<br />
we going to see an different version of nagrand arena in WoD? Maybe more #savage<br />
One of our longterm goals is to improve the visuals of the arenas while preserving their layouts. More to come on that. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486618427243511808))<br />
awesome, looking forward to see what is to come. Cant wait testing out Ashran when its on beta, druid ready to explore n kill! <br />
We're working to get Ashran playable in Beta very soon. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486619350787297282))<br />
<br />
then what about shooting through a hill in a bg map? Is that latency to?<br />
No terrain does not break LoS in WoW. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486679086027124736))<br />
<br />
so do you think they will ever make an arena that is wide open? Nowhere to hide type arena<br />
No, line of sight and positioning are a critical part of arena PvP (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486514428557275138))<br />
of unless you are a caster or hunter who can shoot through solid objects. Which has been a problem for years<br />
In arena? Barring latency, the objects in arena do block line of sight. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486677424709464065))<br />
so all the complaints about shooting through solid objects is being blamed on latency.<br />
do you have any specific examples? Generally, objects in arena break LoS. But for moving targets, latency matters. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486678785438146561))<br />
for instance, on my client, I may see myself behind the pillar, but on your client I haven't made it there yet. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486678894502633473))<br />
is that something that is trying to be fixed in WOD?<br />
No because it's the nature of online multiplayers games. Synchronization is often sacrificed for responsiveness. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486682572747845632))<br />
<br />
I remember you asking how to increase arena participation a while back. *hint*hint*<br />
We are creating new Vicious mounts of the Combatant achievements. It was very effective for increasing participation. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486679600164896768))<br />
<br />
I remember seeing something about the window for getting the vicious saddle being extended. True or am I just imagining things?<br />
The vicious saddle will be available each season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486676717855981568))<br />
The same one available for s14 is still obtainable now then? Just trying to be sure to clear up confusion between friends and I<br />
You can obtain one Vicious Saddle per character each season. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486677271650902016))<br />
<br />
Well you can't really blame people. I don't give a crap about store mounts, but your answer was kinda poor and now deleted<br />
The irony is that we're already making more PvP mounts. I know people are upset, but we are doing what they want. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486581329257955328))<br />
1 Ground mount per expansion isn't what people want. Again you presume to thin you know what we want.<br />
who said one per expac was the plan? I think you are making assumptions. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486965201506287617))<br />
Sorry, it's actually two. For each faction. That's what we got for MoP. Did the plan change for WoD?<br />
We hope to do 2 per season as long as we can. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486983058914955265))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
So Dave, outside Pandaria are there any beings to compare the celestials to? Or are they unique?<br />
The ancients (Goldrinn, Aviana, etc) are just like Celestials. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/486725641375469568))<br />
<br />
WHOA! The elements on Draenor want balance? They aren't fighting with early h other or mortals for supremacy?<br />
Unlike Azeroth, they don't seek the end to all, but the balance of all elements. The Breakers have other plans... (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487127217265442816))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
are there any negative ramifications for bulldozing your plots?<br />
There is a cost in garrison supplies, but there are also a ton of ways to obtain them (mostly through adventuring!) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/486391208621928449))<br />
<br />
Why the cut to only 3 small garrison plots? Forces picks for the player now, Storehouse or Salvage only choice.<br />
What would you have done with 4, specifically? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/486692681116958720))<br />
I'm afraid of losing that impressive base feel, that houses a true army. Less complete base now.<br />
It's still REALLY big, and full of stuff. Looking forward to feedback when t3 unlocks for sure. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487121503902003201))<br />
<br />
Yep, more alts with Garrisons...<br />
Fine line to walk, rewards per alt. Didn't work out well on the farm. Check out garrison capacity system. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487123825176625152))<br />
<br />
What type of armor will non-human and orcs have? People are nervous around Worgen in Stormwind plate.<br />
They come in the armor of their origins, Night Elf sentinels will look like sentinels, etc. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487051828266164224))<br />
<br />
Can we have a variety of racial guards? Not just one race, but a combination of orcs, trolls, etc?<br />
There are some plans to allow you to customize where your guards come from (e.g. what main city) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487009561329401858))<br />
You mean faction right? Cause there are races without cities.<br />
Yes. You can have all worgen guards and call it Dogfort. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487017272725106688))<br />
Please say Pandaren will be included in this.<br />
Yup! Even some Shado-pan may choose to show up... (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/487051981563781121))<br />
<br />
UI / Addons<br />
you said earlier no &quot;new stuff for arena frames&quot; - not even letting us scale/move them? Or do we have to rely on scripts?<br />
Those frames are reusing the boss frames. We'd prefer to do a more comprehensive overhaul. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486686106990034944))<br />
Is it actually on the list, or something you'd simply like to do?<br />
On the list of things we'd like to do... (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/486700418173382657))<br />

<br />
I think it was a given Ashran would have quick access...it's really no different from Tol Barad in that regard. Your hearthstone is a second way to get somewhere quick and gold challenge modes will probably offer ports to their respective dungeons as well. It's about par for the course as far as travel goes.</div></div><hr />

I planned to level my char from 90lvl to 100 , but when i create char it is already lvl 100 and copy character from my live acc is not working for me :/ In the other hand i can immediately try max level features/spells etc . <br />
This was probably really huge wave , because most of my guild mates got invited too. I am sorry for you guys who have not yet received an invitation :(<br />
<br />
I think you may have just created a character on the PVP test server &quot;Mekkatorque&quot; If you use a premade it's auto 100 and pvp gear on that server, However on &quot;Gilneas&quot; if you premake a character it will be level 90 with 500 ilvl, i was also able to copy my own characters over on this server. <br />
<br />
As for leveling though as far as i know it's capped at level 92 at the moment! hope this helps :D</div></div><hr />

I've been very active on their forums for many years, but haven't been subscribed the last 6 or 7 months. I have also played since 2006, so I could easily have been within the groups of these first two waves(I think). If I had not unsubscibed half a year ago!<br />

To be fair. I would not have been on this forum if I didn't have any interest in their game, or a passion for it. That doesn't mean I'm staying subscribed all the time. I have played for a long time, and have run out of content of interest much more frequent the longer I have played.</div></div><hr />

Another &quot;Pandaria&quot; expansion for people who love progress through dungeons..they have also said that Heroic Dungeons will be more challenging than LFR and yet again blue rewards in dungeons that will stay relevant for 2-3 weeks...then it will be one of the same..you want to progress further but you are a casual or a small group of friends that seek challenging content? join LFR again. Another 2-3 monther expansion for me. Once I level 2-3 chars to 100 and see some dungeons, will quit again. I am not gonna run LFR, ever..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normal dungeon gear will be enough for hc dungeons, with hc dungeon gear being slightly better than lfr gear. So you get to choose! LFR gear and hc dungeon gear will both be enough for the first normal raid. And normal raids are flexible, meaning you can do it already with 10 man, so even you and your small group of friends!<br />
<br />
Also, progress through dungeons before raids has always been the case... Good thing imo, since not everybody levels at the same pace, so you always get to do content with the few people that dinged max level at the same time as you.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say the word guarenteed. But having friends who started in wrath and have gotten one, i believe i am more of a veteran and have used more money on subs than they have (Which seems to be the criteria in the last two waves).<br />

<br />
The &quot;final wave&quot; for Annual Pass peeps was 400k strong on April 19,2012. Beta continued for several months after and while I do not remember or have the dates after that, next waves consisted of the few stragglers that weren't flagged due to various issues on their accounts, and the remaining Opt-Ins.<br />
<br />
The fact still remains that anyone who wanted in could get in by doing nothing more than signing up for annual pass which cost nothing. You simply signed an agreement stating you'd keep doing what you were already doing for a year. So complaints about never getting beta were kind of removed as being valid during MoP.

Signing up for a full year is not the same as costing &quot;nothing&quot;. A lot of people suspend and then resume their subscription. They would had had to pay a sub for the dry period before the release of MoP. I still remember a huge number of complaints on this forum by people stuck with the annual pass. It may not have made any difference to you but you can't make that assertion about anyone else.</div></div><hr />

You were guaranteed a beta invite with the AP, it cost nothing except 12 months of active sub time. If you aren't actively subbed for a 12 month stretch and you weren't enticed by the free mount, guaranteed beta invite and free copy of Diablo 3 then I am not sure you really need the beta invite in the first place.</div></div><hr />

How do you come to your conclusion? He didn't need the beta because he might not have wanted a superficial item like a mount, a &quot;free&quot; copy of a game he might not be interested in, and a years sub which he might not have known if he was able to pay that full time. I wish understood your logic that buying something, in this case the annual pass, somehow means that he didn't need / want to be in the beta. In the end it had a cost, and that was 12 months of active subs. That's a cost of $180, for a beta when at the time the game was in a stagnant period with no content being added just like it currently is.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for me, I was in the WotLK beta. Haven't gotten into the WoD beta yet which boggles my mind as they keep insisting it favors those that have been in the game a long time, with lots of sub time, and are currently subscribed. I've first subbed to WoW in May 2005, which means my account has existed for 9 years and 2 months. I have a total active sub time of 5 years 7 months. I also have a current subscription. Either I have really horrible luck, or there are some more criteria here that are working against me.</div></div><hr />

The point remains that he was guaranteed a beta invite. If you were subbed to WoW for that whole time period it cost you quite literally nothing. If you're the type to not remain actively subbed and just pop in/out of the game for a few months out of the year then why would you think you are entitled to beta access? Are you honestly looking to test the game or just use it as a freebie expansion trial? <br />

Honestly I don't really care how Blizzard handles their betas, and other MMOs tend to have more open beta periods which I appreciate. But I also don't stamp my feet and make forum posts when I don't get beta invites, especially when all signs point to this beta being more of an open beta than Vanilla/BC/WoLK, although perhaps not as open as MoP, and last expansion's beta invite was available to everyone who lived in an area where the AP was made available.</div></div><hr />

It's about how you can already look the same as each other by going to the barber shop.</div></div><hr />

There's nothing to get. It's not funny. Apparently players should just readily accept sameface because it's more feasible. Who cares if models look nothing like your old one and all look the same? It's like, really hard for them to make it happen, so you've got no right to not like it.</div></div><hr />

The comic makes fun of the comic itself. It shows that the maker of the comic is a hypocrit that demands more complex and different faces and not the same face with different features but on the other hand always draws the same faces for his own comic characters and also just changes facial features like the haircut and hair color.</div></div><hr />

Playing since Jan 1 2006, login a few times every week, do flex 4 on my main and alt and... didn't get an invite. At least with people like you not getting one I feel better.</div></div><hr />

Above the big &quot;Play&quot; button there's a drop down menu where you should be able to click on &quot;Beta: Warlords of Draenor&quot; below &quot;In development&quot;.<br />
Before you download anything I suggest you delete all old beta/ptr things on your computer and then download the WoD one(if/when you get it).</div></div><hr />
