Recent Living Bomb and Hot Streak Changes<br />
[blizzquote author=Crygil source=http://blue.mmo-champion.com/4/19110153306-recent-living-bomb-and-hot-streak-changes.html]During the 3.2 development cycle, players reported the bug that Hot Streak did not trigger from Living Bomb critical periodic damage. Initially, we made the decision to continue preventing Hot Streak from triggering. This resulted in the “non-periodic&quot; text being added to the Hot Streak tooltip. Late in the 3.2 cycle, the decision was revisited, and Hot Streak was allowed to trigger from Living Bomb periodic damage, but too late to correct the tooltip. However, around the same time, Living Bomb was changed to be allowed on multiple targets per Mage. <br />
<br />
In addition, our QA team discovered a 3.2.0 live bug that periodic damage from Fireball and Frostfire Bolt was being counted toward breaking the Hot Streak (as these could never crit). In discussion yesterday, we determined that with multiple targets per Mage, Living Bomb periodic damage triggering Hot Streak was too powerful. However, we still liked Living Bomb being used on multiple targets and didn’t want to change that. Instead, yesterday (Wed Aug 5) we hotfixed Hot Streak so it could no longer be triggered by periodic damage, resolving both the bug with Fireball and Frostfire Bolt, and the balance concern with Living Bomb. In the course of that hotfix, a data error was introduced which caused the non-periodic damage from Fireball and Frostfire Bolt to never break the Hot Streak streaks on non-crits. That data error was corrected with a hotfix this morning (Thr Aug 6).<br />
<br />
Final result:<br />
Host Streak triggers exactly as stated in its tooltip: “2 non-periodic spell criticals in a row using Fireball, Fire Blast, Scorch, Living Bomb, or Frostfire Bolt”. Only non-periodic damage interacts with it, and only those spells listed. Periodics do not affect the streak in any way. Direct damage from the listed spells always count, for or against the streak.<br />
<br />
Sorry for any confusion that resulted from us not posting this sooner. We’ve been making many fixes since 3.2 went live this week.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't OP in any way! It put mages back where they should always have been. It's a cloth-wearing pure DPS class, so why shouldn't it be allowed to have as high DPS as any rogue or hunter?..<br />
<br />
If they really want to fix this in a reasonable way, they should make LB single-target again, but make hot streak proc from the dot crits.</div></div><hr />

Are you serious? I saw a mage do 8.5k DPS in the new 5-man, as she was just spamming Pyroblast the entire time. It needed a change.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you're laying it on a bit thick there.. I didn't experience such a huge boost at all.<br />
I don't see how it's possible in a 5-man instance unless you have like 70% crit.</div></div><hr />

The periodic damage could trigger hot streak with the glyph, but it couldn't break it. So if the periodic damage went Crit, non-crit, Crit without any other casting in between, she would get a hot streak. Certainly non intended, and she was just spamming pyro and laughing. <br />
<br />
Would she be able to duplicate this everytime? Doubtful. But in makes for poor balancing for this to be allowed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
As you point out yourself, it's completely random. But so are many of the things triggering hot streak..<br />
Maybe they could make a fix, disabling every other hot streak from LB dot crit. That would deal with the worst randomness, while still leaving a pretty nice dps boost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally agree with you! most boss fights are single target and now we cant get hot streak from LB ticks this change is just totally useless. Thanks blizzard for giving us false hope.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bug</div><div class="date">2009-08-07, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">trash or pvp with living bomb multi crit hs was like:<br />
<br />
<br />
tab trash/players and place 10 living bombs. <br />
after 6 or 8 living bombs were placed, hot streak started procc<br />
<br />
now you could chose, <br />
AOE + final ticks from living bombs<br />
or endless instant pyros to 1 focus target<br />
<br />
both resulted in 15-25k dps over 10sec in both, pvp and pve if targets stood close to each others<br />
so its about 30% higher than 3.1 aoe.<br />
maybe too much, but shouldnt mages be the best aoe class as stated?<br />
<br />
therefor we were indeed glasscanons. real glasscannons. for 1 day<br />
<br />
this was great fun to play.<br />
just lower pyro ignite dmg or lower pyro dmg, or bring HS proccs something like &quot;2 times in a row = 1HS, within next 5sec you need 3 times in a row for another one&quot; dont know<br />
<br />
<br />
but this was great gameplay. much more flexible, much more spontanous, much more diffrent, much more difficult.<br />
<br />
it really rocked. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
mage damage is gonna go from shit to omg whats the point in mages being in raids lets just get locks ! <br />
<br />
:'( <br />
<br />
major nerf for mages in my eyes.<br />
<br />
altho i must say me and a few my guildies have been farming 5man normal ToC for abyss crystals &amp; too see what boss memories we can get to spawn. <br />
<br />
and on the 2nd boss when all those mobs come in. we just gather them up and i tab and lb all the targets doing like 6K crits over and over and hot streak triggers liked 8+ times, and with 4/5 mage t8.5 bonus it doesnt always use the proc. and end up getting 4 in a row.<br />
<br />
so wonder how hard it will be to get fireball to proc hot streak . . .</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">roiber-</div><div class="date">2009-08-07, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">seriously?<br />
<br />
1. i agree with the living bomb changes. with multiple living bomb targets the hot streak procs where overpowered.<br />
2. but the fact that hotstreak is now just like it used to be in 3.1 is stupid.<br />
<br />
yes the living bomb change to multiple target boosts our dps on multi-mob-bossfights slightly. yes just slightly, exactly where the mage needs to be, on the same level as other pure dps classes. on single target fights on the other hand, wich are most of the fights in wow, it gives us exactly nothing, leaving us behind locks, rogues and hunters just like we used to be. and thats just not cool. its really annoying blizzard doesnt see this. <br />
<br />
make hot streak proc again from 2 crits, even if not in a row. crit - noncrit - crit = hs proc<br />
thats the boost we need on single target fights, and no its nowhere near overpowered. it just fits perfectly (made our mages finnaly on par with other pure dps classes in our ulduar raid)<br />
<br />
besides that, it would level the rng a bit. its just freaking annoying if your unlucky. ive got several hardmode kills over the last few months where ive been literaly without a single hotstreak proc in minutes!<br />
<br />
damn you<br />
<br />
edit: and yes, get your shit together. that bug was forseeable. thats what happens when you rush. next time take your time to do it right. because now we have just another few months ahead without being competitive... again... since bt...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Good thing every boss fight is just like Patches and you simply remain stationary and attack a stationary target, amirite? 8-8.5k dps on the 1st and 3rd boss fights, not while aoeing a bunch of trash. But feel free to continue your &quot;woe is me&quot; attitude about your class, it sure helps to break the stereotype of the crying mage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like other mages told, if they think that was to OP (and if i remember it well they don't say it, they just say &quot;to fix a bug&quot;) they could take us the multiple target's... 9/10 mages would be happy with this.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Read it again and for what i can understand they change it for both reasons: be OP and to correct a bug. Anyway i still think they could keep HS proc from periodical dmg and take the multiple LB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are not gonna see much hot streak streaks when we start dropping 4pt8 anyway</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the &quot;power guidelines&quot; Blizzard uses are just that, guidelines, and not hard-and-fast rules. The fact the Living Bomb glyph is more powerful than the usual glyph doesn't alone mean that is a problem, just like the fact the Hot Streak talent is far more powerful than the usual talent per point doesn't mean Hot Streak itself is broken in some way. Certain talents *and* glyphs are simply &quot;expected&quot; parts of certain specs and their power level is taken into account when balancing everything else.<br />
<br />
Also, the blue post lies about both changes being made &quot;around the same time.&quot; They were made over a month apart with confirmations from Ghostcrawler on June 29th and July 30th that each was intended, the second in reply to a post mentioning both changes at once. Basically they couldn't figure out a quick way to fix the bug (that fireball/FFB dots were breaking streaks) and reverted Hot Streak completely to 3.1 code. It wasn't considered overpowered until there was a bug they couldn't fix.<br />
<br />
As for those talking about mage QQ, just how many other classes have to worry about HOTFIX nerfs, rather than at least waiting until another real patch gets pushed for a nerf? I don't mean bugfixes, I mean nerfs. This wasn't a bug (in fact the only bug having to do with it WEAKENED it), it was confirmed intended, and then nerfed. And this is the fourth patch in a row mages have received a nerf within 2 days of patch via HOTFIX. Paladins and DK's get to be overpowered (if this was indeed OP at all, there's not enough data yet) for months, not days, while Blizzard collects data to decide on a nerf.</div></div><hr />

Living Bomb = Causes 153 Fire damage every 3. After 12 sec or when the spell is dispelled, the target explodes causing 306 Fire damage to all enemies within 10 yards.<br />
<br />
So just looking here, for each target, he will probably get a HS proc after 9 seconds, crit, noncrit, crit. If your arguement is then, having two living bombs up, would increase that or whatever; that would almost work if, you target someone, LB, then instantly LB someone else, then a 100% crit chance, you would get a pyro every 3 seconds. Fireball talented, and glpyh'd, does more dmg every 3 seconds then a pyro.Fireball 3 seconds aying you have no haste. <br />
<br />
And Hot Streak doesnt stack, so having like &quot;10 other people LB&quot;, ALL CRITing at once, would still equal, 1 pyro.<br />
And If your casting an instant pyro, the Hot Streak buff lingers, sometimes sucking up another Hot Streak proc. <br />
<br />
ONLY way a mage could spam pyros, was that he timed them so well, that all 10 people were LB'd at different 3 second intervals, all critting. That would be four pyro's maximum, until needed to reLB all 10 people, still a 1 second wait between each pyro.<br />
<br />
I wish they kept it to 1 target and ticks criting. Laughing at people wanting more than one target then ticks criting</div></div><hr />

The thing is, the better geared you were the more streaks you had. I had a bit of fun doing BG with 4pt8 basicly just tab targeting people and putting living bomb on them. Within seconds i would get a pyro proc, wich i used instantly and just kept on putting LB up. Doing that i more or less just kept on doing:<br />
<br />
Pyro<br />
LB<br />
Pyro<br />
LB<br />
Pyro<br />
LB<br />
Pyro<br />
LB<br />
Pyro<br />
<br />
I wasnt really running oom either since having Ignite running on so many people plus the mana back from critting kept me going at 90% mana for a long time. The rotation does consume alot of mana but you gain shitloads back from it aswell.<br />
<br />
It was strong, probably as strong as ret paladins were at the start of WOTLK but spread over multiple people. And it required skill to use effectively since as fire specced you still die when a rogue breaths on you or when a ret pala looks at you funny</div></div><hr />

(Using my mage for the numbers.)<br />
Pyroblast = 718 mana, if crit, 30% mana back, = 215 mana. Total mana lost = 503 (if crit everytime)<br />
Living Bomb = 718 mana, if crit, 30% mana back, = 215 mana. Total mana lost 503 (if crit everytime)<br />
If you crit, 2% mana back every 2 seconds = 4% mana back total = 756 mana<br />
756 mana back every 4 second, if criting non-stop<br />
<br />
Total mana lost = 503 everyone GCD (Pyro, Lb, Pyro, LB), [756 mana per 4 seconds, converted into seconds, 189 per second. 314 mana lost everyone second doing that pyro LB rotation. My mage's mana bar would last 60 seconds, self buffed with that rotation. Just under the circumstances that you never casted any other spell (in pvp), and you crit with every single spell againts pvp, resiled geared players. So yea<br />
<br />
And my pyroblast hit for 9363, on a test dummy, with molten fury talent accounted for. Armory Dpser<br />
<br />
Those stats are from a 80 mage in full 8.5, self buffed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LB periodic proccing HS was absolutely retarded. I was overwriting so many HS procs it was unbelieveable, and it was really clumsy as a rotation, turning into facerolling your pyro every two seconds- pretty skilful! LB on multiple targets is a great change, it means that our AE dps is no longer static in the form of FS/Blizzard and is fantastic on Freya and Mimiron hardmodes where DPS is crucial.<br />
<br />
So why are people crying so much about single target DPS? Have you been to patchwerk lately, or even looked at combat logs of your performance? Sure Ulduar comparative to Naxx brought with it a lot of movement, however if you aren't completely braindead, it's still fairly easy to destroy the meters as a mage.<br />
<br />
Appreciatively I have close to full Ulduar gear, none of it is out of reach for your average raider (barring HM IC cloak) and I still have the badge i200 trinket. I put out 7.3 on patch the week before 3.2 (RNG wasn't overly insane) and was routinely around or occasionally over 6k on mimiron hardmode (until we start wiping.) Even on Thorim hardmode with all the movement, I don't find myself very far down the list, although I did lol when I was linked that apparently rogues are hard done by on DPS :D<br />
<br />
Things will only get better for mages, RNG is a sucker for HS procs, but all the upcoming setbonuses are geared towards crit (which I'm pretty so-so about, but could be worse) so all those complaining about crit rates need not worry any longer.</div></div><hr />

I don't think that this is possible with the spell coding, if it is, would it then proc off the last AE LB you did? I don't think it needs rebuffing back, might be worth a new glyph though for single target i.e. can only cast living bomb on one target, but periodic ticks crit and proc hotstreak... only if mage dps drops off the charts, currently it's fine.</div></div><hr />

This. He is right nothing has really changed, and for all of those falling behind the hybrid class you might want to consider playing something else.

You're wrong, the idiot you quoted is wrong. The Fact of the matter is that now mages are below other pure dps classes and even hybrids, with exception on only a few Boss fights. I.E. General and Hodir. <br />
<br />
http://www.wowmeteronline.com/rank/clazz/dps/all/7/0/3<br />
<br />
If you honestly fall behind rogues by only that small of a margin as you claim, you're guilds' rogues need to do better, and most likely your feral druid(s) also are lacking.<br />
<br />
For 16 hours mages were nearly on par with rogues and warlocks, still behind, but closer to where most mages-including good mages-would agree we need to be. LB on multiple targets is nice, but it doesn't help in the long run for the most part with the main thing mages need, which is higher single target dps. HS procs from LB ticks was a big part of this.<br />
<br />
They could easily add a glyph that would allow us to be able to count LB ticks for HS procs from our original LB target, while in contrast said glyph also makes us unable to LB multiple targets. I dont' take credit for this idea, many people have already made the suggestion. It would help greatly solve both a lack of potential in PVE, while at the same time not making us pyroblast machines in PVP. Any decent mage would probably happily HS procs via ticks from 1 LB vs spamming LB on multiple targets.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, why do mages have to be top damage. That position does, and SHOULD belong to the rogues. They bring 1 thing, damage. Their job, stick the pointy end in the bad guy. I loled at the 'i'm falling behind rogues hunters and warlocks' argument because other pure dmg classes are outdpsing you this is a cause to rally and QQ? Now, i agree, ya'll should be ahead of the hybrids but as for top dps, nah Rogues should own 90% ofthe time.<br />
<br />
And honestly, what does it matter which of the pure dps classes are tops on the dmg meter, as long as it is a pure dmg class (barring there's not an exceptional hybrid player out there with more just plain skill, which there are. I've seen some horrible mages in my day and i've seen some very good ones.<br />
<br />
Now, about your link. What is that, the top 20 dps done on those particular bosses.. or the top dps done by those using WMO to track. And you neglected to mention YS HM in your statement up top since you do have 45% of the slots there filled. Show averages of the classes not the top dmg by a person who quite honestly could have been extrememly lucky with his RNG and happen to score high on the meters that day (or that fight). Or, maybe those people are just better than you.<br />
<br />
What i honestly want to know is, this was considered a bug when it first happened, but dev team decided to let you run with it. As stated this was not an intended change, but it was interesting and they decided to let you keep it. So why would they test it? its not on the list of stuff that NEEDS to be tested and now they see that it was, in fact, too powerful (in the eyes of the dev team) so they lowered it down to where they thought it needed to be. There were some good ideas thrown around about how to fix it, and if i were to pick one it would be the single target with allowing the crits to proc HS definitely not multi target proc'ing HS.<br />

If mages are consistently outdpsing or even coming very close to rogues and feral druids in 25 man ULD, then it's 1 of two things: 1- that mage is godly, literally, or 2- the rogues/feral druids aren't doing what they need to be doing. The latter is most likely true by far.<br />
<br />
You've completely misunderstood, either because you simply read this thread and apply the &quot;QQ&quot; excuse, or because you have never played a mage and will never see things from our end. My guess is a little of both.<br />

First, most mages are NOT arguing that we should be top damage, our legitimate argument is, we SHOULD be very close to, if not on par with the other top damage dealers. We are a pure dps class, plain and simple, we may offer some utility, even more so than rogues, but our main function is pew pewage. When hybrids have the potential to outdps us, then yes, something is wrong.<br />
<br />
There are horrible, good, and bad players of every class, but let me explain to you exactly what that link shows and proves. It shows the top 20 damage done per boss in Ulduar. Again, notice the only fights where mages can shine are gimmicky fights, such as Hodir and General. Yes, YS is represented by mages fairly well too. Obviously some are very good players, but the fact and main point is, it shows the POTENTIAL of individual classes. Mages rely more on the RNG than nearly any other class. If mages were &quot;extremely&quot; lucky, we'd at least have some representation on other boss fights.<br />
<br />
Bug or not, we competed with other top damage classes, (rogues, hunters, feral druids) on more fights than those listed above for a short period. Multiple LB proccing HS procs on numerous targets is a little too strong for PVP, It is fun, but it doesn't address the main issue mages are facing right now, which is single target dps. Like so many people have shown, both problems could be dealt with using a single glyph and/or change.<br />
<br />
As it stands atm, mages are considered average dps, and we are now the most squishy class in the game. Blizzard coined the phrase &quot;Glass Cannon&quot;, this does not refer to a class doing &quot;average&quot; damage while also having the lowest HP. As it stands, we are closer to a Class Rifle. The reason so many mages, including GOOD mages are upset is because we've seen our class devolve from something it was meant to be to somewhat of a shadow and mere utility. <br />

I give kudos to healers, but something tells me you've only been playing the game since WOTLK. Why does this matter, you ask? Because you'd know a lot better where mages are coming from if you even knew our history.</div></div><hr />
