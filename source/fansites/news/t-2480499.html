Please note that the goal here isn’t to just counter-tune specs in each bit of new content as we believe specs that work well in an encounter should continue to do so.<br />
<br />
Regarding this specific Shadow Priest change, their multi-target performance was beyond our tuning targets and so we simply want to bring them back into range while minimizing the impact to their single-target performance.<br />

<br />
Shadow<br />
Auspicious Spirits damage reduced to 70% (was 100%).<br />
<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: The damage reduction to this talent is meant to curb the synergy of Insanity and Shadowy Apparition generation when combined with some Azerite traits, while still leaving it as a fun and interesting combo.<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Abyssal Speaker's Gauntlets (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167841-abyssal-speakers-gauntlets) shield absorption effect is reduced by 66% when engaged in combat with enemy players.<br />
Trident of Deep Ocean (https://www.wowdb.com/items/167864-trident-of-deep-ocean) shield absorption effect is reduced by 50% when engaged in combat with enemy players.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Patch 8.2 PTR Class Changes<br />
We have a few more class changes coming to the Rise of Azshara PTR. We made the initial changes and the following will be active on the PTR soon.<br />

<br />
Vengeance<br />
<br />
Metamorphosis<br />
<br />
Health bonus 50% (from 30%)<br />
Now causes Shear to generate 20 additional Pain and 1 additional Lesser Soul Fragment (was: generates 7 Pain per second).<br />
<br />
Developers’ Note: This significantly increases the self-healing potential of Metamorphosis, as well as the health buffer, making it a more reliable major cooldown against all types of damage.<br />

<br />
Guardian<br />
<br />
Frenzied Regeneration (Rank 3) is learned at level 85:<br />
<br />
Frenzied Regeneration spends up to 30 additional Rage to immediately heal you for up to 18% additional health.<br />
<br />
Note: This spell is affected by Guardian of Elune, but not affected by mastery.<br />
<br />

<br />
Frost<br />
<br />
Runic Empowerment has a 2.0% chance to proc per Runic Power spent (from 1.5%)<br />
Frost Fever’s chance to generate Runic Power increased to 30%<br />
<br />
Chance now diminishes on targets beyond the first<br />
<br />
Breath of Sindragosa now has double the usual chance to proc Runic Empowerment<br />
Breath of Sindragosa costs 18 Runic Power/sec (from 15)<br />
<br />
Developers’ Note: Frost was starved of resources too often, especially when using Breath of Sindragosa. This increases Frosts’s Rune income baseline and includes a further change that returns many extra Runes while using Breath of Sindragosa. Breath builds will now be able to fill more global cooldowns with casts of Obliterate, to make up for the lost Frost Strikes. The cost of Breath itself is increased to keep its overall duration roughly unchanged.</div></div><hr />

It's an utterly idiotic talent which limits your gameplay to burst windows only. First of all this style is boring as fuck, as well as unrewarding. People need more action, not a 15sec window in which they do damage, then poke their noses for 2 minutes. We need to press more buttons, and I mean different buttons, not the same ones but more times. Give us our short gcd back. Remove pillar and horn from gcd.

As Blizzard already said, SP is/was overtuned for multi-dotting raid fights. Outlaw rogue has nothing to do with that. End of story.</div></div><hr />

Totally meta that’s why spriest is being picked over other ranged for the top heroic runs, come back when mythic is cleared to prove my point.

For m+ it's because they lack utility<br />
<br />
For CoS they are so far ahead in dps that you probably can't see them anymore so you think they are not part of meta. Just go to warcraftlogs and you will see, I wouldn't be surprised if world first Uunat will be done with 5 spriests in raid.<br />
<br />
As for the spriest nerf...well it's kinda justified, I just hope it won't hit their single target dps too much, but I don't think so.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a bit of a weird change for sure, but I can maybe see this being useful in a scenario where you don't use Ironfur (where there's more casters than melee), similar to how a warrior sometimes chooses not to Shield Block just to spam Ignore Pain. Maybe it'll play out nicely with the already announced reduced cost to the other two (Ironfur and Maul). We'll see when it makes it to PTR.</div></div><hr />

This right here, no question about it. Not to mention I play Affliction and Shadow....Meta is the bane of Wow, it has completely destroyed the ability to take any further advice,&quot;Play whatever you enjoy&quot; yeah, no doesn't work that way. <br />
<br />
Soooo, when one gets nerfed we switch to the next meta, so long as you are running each range class, keeping each one ready to go at a nerf bats notice. That means, Balance, Shadow, Warlock (all flavors), Hunter (both range), Mage (all flavors), Ele, and on and on, rinse and repeat. <br />
<br />
Flashing that warcaft logs always seems to be the trump card for everyone in all arguments...not even sure we could perform without all this hand holding, think everyone would explode if we lost all ability to see how god like we are..or when to step right, step left, step back, soak this, soak that, nut to butt yah buddy, LEFT SIDE!!, grab orb, move orb, stop casting, cast..<br />
<br />
Run a raid without it now, no meters, no log tracking..nothing, is it even possible anymore? Something tells me no..get rid of DBM, play only using the default UI. *laughs* nope, we can't.. <br />

All of that only applies to high end mythic raids and mythic+ dungeons. Nobody cares if you don't play the best specs in normal or heroic. If you're just doing it for fun then you can play whatever you like. If you are doing it to rank, you want to use all the best tools available to achieve that and if you don't pull your weight, you might get replaced with someone who is better than you. <br />
<br />
It's not exclusive to WoW, it's not even exclusive to MMOs or even video games. It's like that in anything. There's a big difference between someone who plays a sport as a hobby and someone who is going for a championship. You'll have plenty of people who play the sport as a hobby pull up stats and tools that the pros use, too. That's why endorsements exist. Doesn't mean the competitive setting is &quot;ruining&quot; the sport. It's just a different level.</div></div><hr />

Soooo, when one gets nerfed we switch to the next meta, so long as you are running each range class, keeping each one ready to go at a nerf bats notice. That means, Balance, Shadow, Warlock (all flavors), Hunter (both range), Mage (all flavors), Ele, and on and on, rinse and repeat. <br />
<br />
Flashing that warcaft logs always seems to be the trump card for everyone in all arguments...not even sure we could perform without all this hand holding, think everyone would explode if we lost all ability to see how god like we are..or when to step right, step left, step back, soak this, soak that, nut to butt yah buddy, LEFT SIDE!!, grab orb, move orb, stop casting, cast..<br />
<br />
Run a raid without it now, no meters, no log tracking..nothing, is it even possible anymore? Something tells me no..get rid of DBM, play only using the default UI. *laughs* nope, we can't.. <br />
<br />
&quot;THIS says otherwise...&quot; is exactly how we are as a player base forever more..<br />
this might be shocking. but bosses are designed with Boss Mods in Mind</div></div><hr />

What is even the point of this wall? Meta have always been a thing. Addon's have always been a thing. And yes, logs is a trump card as it shows the numbers we need to make a conclusion.<br />
<br />
And we couldn't raid without DBM, as raid encounters are made with DBM in mind. There is too much to keep track of to do it without tools. Just take a look at current fights vs Vanilla fights, if you're wondering how fights would be without tools to help us keep track of shit.<br />
<br />
And unless you're pushing for realm first Mythic clears, meta is of no concern to you. You can play what ever you enjoy and still clear HC (heck, even Mythic when you've geared up enough) as any class/spec in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It gives you an idea of how fights will look like in mythic. If you look at Heroic BoD and Mythic BoD the class/spec ranking for each boss is very similar if not same.<br />
Also, you can tune in Limit raid, they have 5 shadow priests, that can give you an idea of how strong this spec is</div></div><hr />

<br />
With this logic, why isn't all the other classes at the same rankings?</div></div><hr />

Not saying spriests are in a bad spot cause they def not, but they definitely didn’t need a nerf especially when some other classes’s nerf is loooooong overdue<br />
<br />
So... Limit are currently using 8 Shadow Priests for progress. I think the nerf is justified.</div></div><hr />

What did you smoke to think that shadow is not meta in cos.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I personally hate BoS' playstyle (pooling resources is not fun for me), but I respect the ones who like it. I would definitely like to go back to MG Frost though, it's what made me love this spec for several expansions.</div></div><hr />
