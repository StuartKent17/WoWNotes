New teleportation portals in 2.4 ?<br />
That's a change I didn't notice when I checked the latest PTR build patch, but it looks like two new teleportation portals have been added to the game. These portals should let players teleport to Theramore and Stonard, but it's still unknown if they will be used as part of an event or just added to the mage spell book. This could also be linked to this quest (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=11223) but in this case I don't really understand why they would add a Stonard portal as well. Thanks a lot to endarion for his mail about this !<br />
<br />
Note : I know that the TP to Theramore shows Stormwind as the background of the portal, it could either mean that both portals will use the same graphic or just that the one for Theramore isn't included in the patch yet. <br />

GMs on Tournament Test Realms<br />
Yesterday, some members of the Blizzard dev and community team were on Tournament Test Realms to run a few tests on the new servers deployed to host the worldwide arena tournament later this year. The servers crashed a few times (and again, it was &quot;intended&quot;, that's the whole point of a stress test) but we had the opportunity to see a few GMs having fun, below are a few screenshots. Some players also had the change to fight Blizzard teams in Arena matches. <br />

WoW video renders<br />
Sometimes, you can really get nice things with a lot of time and knowledge of 3D tools, and a bunch of WoW Models. The videos below show how WoW would like with tons of increased lightning and a few other nice effects (You can also check qelsss's youtube profile for a few more videos (http://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=qelsss&amp;p=r)). These videos are made by a fan, they're not official and are NOT a preview of anything.<br />

Comics<br />
With the release of the 2.4 patch on PTRs I had to stop reporting new comics in news, now that the amount of news to report is nearly back to normal it's time to post all the comics I missed. Belows are 4 of them, 3 from the official site and the latest one from Dark Legacy. <br />

Bit too late for this, end of KZ raiding in 3-4 months. It's more for leveling, as Horde doesn't have a single portal near these places. Sux to be them.<br />
I mean it's obviously Theramore for Ally and Stonard for Horde. Theramore doesn't have an ally town near by, Stonard doesn't have a horde town near by. It's logical.<br />
But the Theramore one will be nice when the 4th CoT instance is released in WotLK.</div></div><hr />

Certainly but how will you go to Shattrath in Wotlk where you'll probably have bound your hearthstone somewhere in Northrend ?<br />
<br />
Also the current mechanism in game works for all classes while the spell icons look like teleport / portal Theramore, thus mage-only spells. Don't think this is for all classes, it looks too Mage-like.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking of the same, else there will be no other use for these port spells. But i dont get it why these spells are getting implemented (if they are getting passed ptr).<br />

Normaly only capital city's have teleport/portal spells.(Counting shatt a bit as capital of outlands)<br />

They're both outposts that are intended to grow, no? They're both intended to establish a foothold in their respective zones, and it's clear from talking to the NPCs and interacting that they're both intended to become much larger than what we see today.<br />
<br />
It'll be neat if, some time in the future, they both do grow, much like the settlement on the Sunwell isle does as the patch 2.4 content progresses. Once they're big enough, portal trainers become more logical.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're both outposts that are intended to grow, no? They're both intended to establish a foothold in their respective zones, and it's clear from talking to the NPCs and interacting that they're both intended to become much larger than what we see today.<br />
<br />
It'll be neat if, some time in the future, they both do grow, much like the settlement on the Sunwell isle does as the patch 2.4 content progresses. Once they're big enough, portal trainers become more logical.<br />
<br />
<br />
Theramore is already pretty large, considering it has a stables, mill, two barracks, mage tower, docks, and more guard towers than all of Elwynn Forest. It also makes quite a bit of sense to add a Portal Trainer there, and probably a Mage Trainer as well, since Jaina Proudmoore is a mage herself, resides in a mage tower, and herself can teleport and mass teleport her group. Theramore already has a Paladin and Warrior Trainer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also I dont see any reason to go to SSC (or TK) after equiping yourself with T6-like BoJ gear... the first MH and BT bosses are really easy... easier than most stuff in SCC (or TK) give superior loot and will be free accessible in 2.4<br />
<br />
<br />
Too bad you get 3 pieces of actually t5 level gear (for most classes, despite the ilevel) and maybe a ring and a weapon or two (which are also not that great)... Come on guys, get serious. The badge gear changes nothing. Its only a few slots, its not ZOMG EPIC, and its so expensive that the raiders that want it will be getting it LONG before the kara causals and all (since they'll be getting badges off every 25 man boss now too, and many of them do kara badge runs as well).</div></div><hr />

To you and to everyone else that said the exact same thing.<br />
First off I'm talking about a guild with brand new raiders. Not retards but good players that want to learn and progress.<br />
Second, I said &quot;farm 300-500 badges before 2.4&quot;. So do KZ and ZA as much as you can before 2.4. I didn't say otherwise. But after 2.4 and after you've gotten your items - it's useless.<br />
Third, I'm saying &quot;start with SSC&quot; because well you need to at least get a feeling of what 25mans are. If you can't down The Loot Below with all badges from the first, second and the upcoming third revision and full blues/pu&#1088;ples from normal/heroic 5mans, all enchanted and gemed (with possibly the new gems?)... well you pretty much won't be able to do anything else. :/<br />

<br />
The pieces that are already on badge gear are Kara/Gruul/Mag level from ver.1, SSC and TK level from ver.2 and MH/BT level from the upcoming ver.3.<br />
The crossbow that's gonna be sold is the best ranged weapon a BM hunter can get up untill Sunwell plateau, the chest, legs and armor for my hunter are exactly BT equivalent and I can replace them only with T6. The bracers and belt I already have from ver.1 are already too awesome for KZ and can be replaced only from ZA/SSC/TK ones. Include the badge cloak here which is perfect for BMs, the Bloodlust Brooch and possibly the Battlemaster's Cruelty/Determination, the new ap ring and the SL polearm which a lot of hunters use up to TK because the lack of luck on Legacy and Trollbane and there you have it. Tons of items that I won't be replacing anytime soon.</div></div><hr />
