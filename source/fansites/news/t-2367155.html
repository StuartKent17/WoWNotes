I still think they will be out before the actual launch of BfA just like how Demon Hunters were released a couple weeks before Legion went live. It's going to be the same exact thing with the first 4 allied races. You pre order BfA and you get them a couple weeks before the official BfA launch.</div></div><hr />

Yes, the magical code fairies descended and changed it during the night. Because programs definitely alter themselves all the time. If it is feasible now it was feasible all this time... they just didn't bother and lied about it.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. And given how many times Blizzard has said something to the effect of: &quot;We just don't have the technology to do that yet&quot;, but then later on figures out a way to do it....I don't know why anyone would be surprised by the backpack thing.</div></div><hr />

Why are you like this? The fact that you are here on this site commenting means you know damn well they never said it was impossible. Every change they make to the game has a cost in terms of resources and time. Updating the code for 4 lousy slots was clearly not worth it to them before. Now it is for some reason. It doesnt make them liars and you are definitely not speaking truth to power or whatever it is you think you are doing by calling them liars.</div></div><hr />

They just felt it was not the answer to the problem. Adding bags would just lead to people hoarding more crap. They instead added the keychain to free slots, made bigger reagents stacks, introduced transmog, the toy box, all of which were more efficient solutions to release bag space.<br />
The technical issues they talked about were creating those new systems. Not adding bag slots.</div></div><hr />

You're the only one acting like people don't know that. And the fact that the code has evolved means that it's entirely possible there is now a way to expand the base backpack that wasn't viable before.</div></div><hr />

Huh? I thought Blizzard had decided to make the token that transforms into the legendary cost 1000 essences and give six times as many essences than activities were presently giving so that people couldn't stock up on them before the patch? I'm confused.</div></div><hr />

Looks like they left it at 175 and didn't increase the drop rate. 175 or 1000 with 6x the drop rate wouldn't make much of a difference anyway</div></div><hr />

It is 1000 for Tokens and 300 for Upgrade, the official Blizzard post has the correct numbers:<br />

<br />
I've been saying this for weeks and I'll repeat it again. Allied races will be part of the pre-order bonus. And it's probably not far around the corner. However, they're going to use us all as guinea pigs for awhile on this level scaling b/c despite PTR we all been here long enough to know they're going to need to tweak things. Allied races will be the carrot on a stick to appease people while we wait on BfA.</div></div><hr />

Not mentioned in the notes, but I'm pretty sure this patch will also include the changes to professions like Enchanting, where a bunch of old mats are getting converted into a fewer number of new ones, and those are used in any legacy enchantments.

ye this is very possible <br />

first they make leveling utter garbage fix it a bit when people complain too much and then release allied races<br />

it woudl be to much at the same time since they know how badly it will be when people realise that nerf to leveling is nothing but pushing char boost sales</div></div><hr />

no thats better, because you only have to run a dungeon 1-2 times on one char and 1-2 times on a 2nd char, but currently sometimes 20 times until you get your shit</div></div><hr />

Or the more likely scenario is that when they decided to redesign the core UI actionbars for BFA ( as they are doing ... I played the BFA demo at Blizzcon ), it was their chance to update the main bag too.<br />
<br />
Guessing by the maturity level of your post that you must be somewhere between 7-10. Here is a tip for you as you grow up: just because things change from time to time, it doesn't mean the world is lying to you. Even things that were once unchangeable, can change. You'll start to figure these things on your own as your brain matures over time.<br />

<br />
<br />
The whole scaled levelling seems somewhat &quot;fishy&quot; to me. I have wanted this for a very long time. But I feel they have overdone it, and its not in order for the levelling to be and feel &quot;right&quot; it feels more like a way to push character boosts through the store. This might be the cynic in me going overboard but it does feel like it if you ask me.<br />
<br />
<br />
All we really wanted was a more meaningful levelling experience. One where we could actually do the zones we wanted without being pushed towards another zone and other storylines half-way through due to us out-levelling everything.<br />
<br />
But what they have done is increasing health pools by a large margin and at the same time they decrease stats on heirlooms all while they also bumps the required amount of XP for levelling 1-60 by a significant amount. It seems like the estimate is that you need about 40% more XP in order to reach level 60 compared to before. That's a lot. When you combine that with the fact that health pools have been increased a lot as well so killing mobs and finishing quests takes about twice the amount of time or even longer compared to live you will be looking at a levelling experience that will take a bunch of time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some will argue that this is a good thing. We get more in-tune with how levelling was before and how its &quot;supposed&quot; to work. And I can see what you mean, but for most people levelling up alts is already a tedious and tiresome process. I for one wanted a more engaging levelling experience where I could fully take part in the storylines without feeling I'm wasting my time on grey mobs and quests half-way through. I didn't want it all to take XX hours longer to reach the same level as before. I don't want to spend more time reaching level 110, I just wanted that time to actually mean something other 1-3 shot kill everything up until level 90 and without you out-levelling all the zones and content along the way.<br />
<br />
Increasing the health pools is a good thing as that would require people to actually start &quot;playing&quot;, start using class rotation and whatnot. But it shouldn't be combined with increased requirement of XP along the way. If anything it should have been the opposite in order to balance out and counter the fact that killing mobs and doing quests will take twice the amount of time or even longer compared to before.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The cynic in me tells me that this has nothing to do with doing it the right way, but more to do with Blizzard pushing the sales of character boosts. What better way to push sales of boosts by making the already very long and tedious levelling process even longer and slower? I almost feel like this whole scaled levelling and the new allied races are here for one simple reason; to get people excited about levelling alts and by making everything feel slower they are making it more likely that people will stop half-way through and just boost and if they do end up playing all the way that additional time spent equals more and longer subscriptions anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its the same with the allied-races. They are nothing like Demon Hunters from Legion where we got actual new content with a new class with new rotation, abilities and playstyle. Its not the same as Draenei, Blood Elves, Goblins and Worgens where we got new levelling zones and experiences. These allied-races are just a simple skin of existing races without any new content along with them. And they are also conveniently gated behind existing content so you are forced into playing Legion if you haven't already in order to unlock them and the last two requires reputation grinding in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Its all about minimal effort and resources spent by Blizzard in order to maximise subscriptions and sales (boosts).</div></div><hr />

Well, aside for one small questline.<br />
<br />
Why are people at all exited about this?<br />
<br />
Maybe because people still like to level in WoW? I know, what a strange concept that people actually still like to experience leveling and how these changes will allow a more dynamic experience and flow due to not one shotting every freaking mob and out leveling the zone in 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
There's tons to be excited about. <br />

<br />
You do need an authenticator, and according to the patch notes you also need SMS Protect meaning a cell phone that can receive text messages. There seems to be some disagreement over whether you really do need to have both, or if the patch notes were just badly written and you only need one or the other. I guess we'll find out tomorrow.<br />
<br />
The Authenticator is really no problem, you can either use the physical one from Blizzard, a phone app, or a Windows app (WinAuth). It will only ask you for the code one time and then it shouldn't ask again unless you log in on a different computer or from a different IP address. I have not been asked for my code for at least a year, maybe longer.<br />
<br />
Honestly though, it's only 4 more slots in your backpack which isn't really that great anyway so I wouldn't worry about it.</div></div><hr />

It support push so instead of having to open the app, read the code and manually type it in you simply get a notification, click approve and your done. The process is pretty much automatic, all you need to do is hit the approve button on your phone. Upon login the entire process starts by itself. You are also authenticated for 30-days or something so its not like you have to do it all the time if you are only using one single machine. Just don't log off from the client app and your are good.</div></div><hr />

But gotta get something extra for bag space. And idiots just lap it up, never once questioning it. <br />

The authentication is handled by the launcher, not the game as it used to be in the beginning, unless of-course you run the game executable directly. Other than that, you only need to authenticate once in most cases, and it will last you months or even years. Also, the app is a handy way to deny connections to your account if the unfortunate scenario comes to happen.</div></div><hr />

Its not really about being &quot;safe&quot; by not clicking phishing links and acting responsibly while using computers and technology. The most &quot;common&quot; way for people to get &quot;hacked&quot; these days are because of server breaches and user information and password database leaking all over the Internet.<br />
<br />
You can user your devices 100% responsibly but when a server gets breached and you happen to have an account in whatever database the hackers are able to extract your user information and password will be out there no matter how &quot;safely&quot; you use your own devices.<br />
<br />
This is the sole reason why GDPR is being enforced in the EU to force companies to actually take more responsibility as account information, passwords and credit card information is getting leaked left and right these days as most companies don't enforce even basic security practices due to the extra amount of cost and the addition amount of hardware it requires.<br />
<br />
When I used the &quot;reset your password&quot; feature on the biggest telecommunication company here in Norway they simply sent me my password in clear text using e-mail... Non-encrypted e-mail.. E-mail is so easily spoofed and gets sent to so many devices using protocols that are so easily compromised. Its beyond ridiculous I couldn't believe it myself and this e-mail is now cached on several servers with my password in clear text.. Bravo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not using two-factor in 2018 is pretty much consider being unsecured and unreasonable just because of how often all these user names and passwords gets leaked all the time.</div></div><hr />

That's the most clueless post of the year. Or even of decade.<br />
<br />
You might want to do basic reading on what authenticator does and how it works. Its not new thing that Blizzard invented, its not something that can spy on you. All modern software with decent security use some kind of 2fa authentication, often different authenticator apps that all do the same as Blizzard authenticator does.<br />
<br />
You don't need to buy anything. Physical authenticators are thing of past. You need to simply install app on your phone. All that app does is generates numbers for you to enter to confirm that its you trying to log in. It doesn't bother you every time you want to log into game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And how is that? Then lets remove shaman ability to reincarnate or priest shoulders that give free ress every 10min.<br />
<br />
The point is, in a raid where you have min 10ppl losing one is 10% loss ( not counting tank ) in 20 or more well its 5% loss ( or even less ) so yeah still possible to do it even if its mythic boss in question ( even if you lose 3-4 ppl, depending on boss HP - not tank ofc but u can lose a healer ) but if you lose healer in M+ you are kinda done ( provided that boss doesnt have small amount of HP ) since most abilities even if u use immunity can kill you fast, like feed on the weak and so on.<br />
<br />
So yeah 10min is a alot, 3m-5m would be ok</div></div><hr />

<br />
How so? They have bumped the XP requirement with about 40% for 1-60 and comparing how long it takes to kill mobs and finish quests you will spending about twice-third times the amount of time compared to what you would normally spend on the same tasks before the patch.<br />
<br />
So you need to get more XP than before in order to reach level 60, and every mob you kill on your way will take much longer. How does this result in it taking the same amount of time?<br />
<br />
The rough estimate on levelling from 1-60 is that it you will need to spend at least twice the amount time if you do exactly the same thing as before the patch. So if you before that patch spent 20 hours reaching level 60, it will now take you 40 hours. These are just examples and not estimates.<br />
<br />
How is that the same?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a really hard time believing you will save that much not having to travel as much/far as before. You don't really manage to do all that much in 10 minutes and it will rarely take you more than tops 15 min to move from one area to the next on the live servers today.<br />
<br />
Mobs gives the exact same amount of XP as before. The major difference is that you will spend 2-3 times the amount of time killing each mob. So that's a 300% decrease in XP per hour just there. This will also make it so that most of the questing will take that much longer as most of the quests have some sort of mob killing associated with it. If it take 2-3 times the amount of time killing each mob for a quest, it will take you 2-3 times the amount finishing the quest. It gets even worse with quests where you have to loot things that don't drop 100% as it will be much faster on live to kill additional mobs in order to get said items compared to after the patch. So for each additional mob you need to kill in order to get the last drops the equation gets worse for after the patch compared to live.<br />
<br />
But you also have quests that don't require killing mobs. You have lots of take this, deliver it over there and various quests where the looting is done by interacting with objects in the world and not by killing mobs. All these will of course still take the same amount of time on both live and 7.3.5. So even though killing takes 2-3 the amount of time it will be close to 2 times due to the fact that you have various quests along the way that won't require you to kill anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
And this is just about the fact that mobs have larger health pools and gear being nerfed so you spend much longer time killing than before. You also have to take into consideration how they have also increased the amount of XP required to level as well. That's another 40% XP required on top of everything basically taking longer.</div></div><hr />

I don't mind to have the authenticator connection to the account as prerequisite. But I do mind the connection to my phone. I already have a security measurement installed, and my account has never been compromised at all. Not once. I don't see the reasoning behind having 2 security measurements for this QoL feature. This is a scam.<br />
<br />
My authenticator is usually stored at home. If burglars break in, they have much more valuable things to steal than my authenticator, which they probably would not even notice because my home is a bit of a mess. But with a mobile phone, which can get lost at any time if you really have bad luck, connecting my account and not being able to play in such a scenario, on top of all other negative effects - I don't need that. Of course, I have never lost anything more valuable than a cheap umbrella or cheap sunglasses, but smartphones could also be pickpocketed.</div></div><hr />

To people who like to level, this is a good thing. There's nothing more annoying than to outlevel a zone in the middle of its story. You either have to miss out on the end of the story or just do a bunch of gray quests. The increased XP makes it so that you can to an entire continent of questing getting to 60, instead of hitting 60 when you're 2/3 of the way through all the zones. This isn't for people who want to level quickly. It's for people who enjoy the process. I don't want boosts, heirlooms, etc. speeding things up. I want to enjoy the story while leveling, and this makes it so the mobs aren't trivial along the way. For me, this is possibly one of the best patches they've had in years. I unsubbed about 9 months ago for the first time since Vanilla, but this patch is going to bring me back.</div></div><hr />

Basically this. I kinda knew they wouldnt be coming what with blizz not saying anything about them at all, but I hoped. I want to level, but what's the point if I'm just going to do it again and again when the new races are released? Better off to just wait and hope the preorder comes soon I guess</div></div><hr />
