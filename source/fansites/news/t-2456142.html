Upcoming Tuning Adjustments - December 18<br />
https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1104519-tuning-adjustments-december-18/;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/48561/1&quot;]With scheduled maintenance next week on 19 December, we’re focusing on shoring up a couple of specs that fell a little behind with Tides of Vengeance:<br />

Developer Q&amp;A Feedback<br />
I know he more then likely didn’t word it right but…It honestly sounds like they only take analysis data into consideration and not their player base…<br />
Which would actually explained a ton about the sate of the current game, class design, and how poor of a state BFA launched…<br />
That Q&amp;A was hard to watch <br />
<br />
I guess you’d be surprised just how much we do read and do listen but that doesn’t mean we do knee-jerk reactions to whatever someone says. We do miss things and do make mistakes, we are still human (unfortunately?), but we do try to consider the implications that changes will have for all player types. We, the World of Warcraft community, are a mass of individuals and not a hive mind.

If you have additional questions or topics to discuss feel free to share those. If there were specific questions you felt weren’t important, please specify those. Keep in mind that what you are wanting answered and what is important to you can easily be different to others… many others.

Yesterday, we announced a difficult decision—the HGC will not be returning in 2019 and we’ll be transitioning some Heroes of the Storm developers to our other game teams. While our extended Blizzard family working on World of Warcraft, Hearthstone, Overwatch, and our unannounced projects will be getting an influx of much-needed, extremely talented Heroes devs to help them achieve their goals, it also means that we’ll need to change the cadence of support for Heroes going forward.<br />
<br />
So, I’m sad. I’m sad because I love this team and this game that we’ve built together, with all of you, and this past year has been such a great one for Heroes of the Storm. The HGC had its best year yet and I was so looking forward to the 2019 season. On the game side, we’ve had a steady stream of some of the most sought-after heroes, amazing themed events, and impactful reworks. We also made meaningful progress on improving core systems and features across the game. We truly hit our stride in 2018, so I’m disappointed that some of the exciting plans we had for 2019 will have to change.<br />
<br />
But all is not lost. The team that remains dedicated to Heroes of the Storm is a veritable Who’s Who of developers who have been driving every facet of the game from the very beginning—from people you know and have seen speak publicly about the game for years, to those who have poured their hearts into it from behind the scenes. In short, we’re continuing to develop the game with an incredible team that has the experience and passion required to support Heroes of the Storm well into the future.<br />
<br />
The Heroes of the Storm team and I also have a unique opportunity to rethink things and reprioritize. Because now more than ever, our charge is to focus on taking care of you, our players, and to channel all our energy into keeping the game dynamic and fun. This means we’re still committed to regular hero reworks, themed events, and even new heroes. We’re setting our sights on the new goals and timelines for what we want to do with the game from here on out and we’re eager to share those plans as soon as they’re finalized.<br />
<br />
So, I’m also excited. I’m excited for my teammates to bring their hard-won experience from making this game to the other teams at Blizzard to help their games be even better. And I’m especially excited for Heroes of the Storm to continue evolving with a renewed focus and purity of purpose.<br />
<br />
Thank you for joining us on the journey so far, and please bear with us through these changes. Your feedback is as critical as ever, and continues to guide our priorities and decisions while helping us be better along the way.<br />
<br />
Thank you,<br />
Kaéo</div></div><hr />

False, it only lets you understand enemy faction talk, it does not let you speak it. In order for the person ganking you to know what you are saying, they also have to use the elixir.</div></div><hr />

You can't use it to grief people so I doubt it will make much of a difference. People already try to add others to battlenet to rage at them, making themselves able to understand you doesn't really do anything.</div></div><hr />

This is incorrect. I purchased the elixir and was able to switch my spoken language to Common. The random gnome player I spoke at definitely took notice!<br />
<br />
Moving to HotS news: Blizzard Entertainment just really, really shat on the HotS community particularly the e-sports teams. Like, Bethesda level of shit. There is no blog message that is going to smooth this over any time soon, especially something so patently disingenous (obvious if you know how to interpret market-speak).</div></div><hr />

then that's an oversight on their part, because Ion was very deliberate to say that you should have to have the elixir on in order to understand what the enemy faction is saying in order to prevent the toxicity they're scared will happen</div></div><hr />

<br />
They said in the Q&amp;A that it is only supposed to make you able to understand the opposite faction, not be able to speak to them. You're only supposed to be able to speak to them if they also choose to enable understanding you.<br />
<br />
If they didn't implement it like that I could see it being a bad idea, a very bad one, but that is not how Ion described it. Literally the opposite actually.<br />
<br />
As for being able to use battlenet anyway, roleplayers don't want to type to their fellows in battlenet whispers with their battletags/real names. That would defeat the purpose of the whole roleplay thing.</div></div><hr />

I don´t know which game will be shit on, but I´m sure what will be the next &quot;new&quot; one: a battle royale game. That´s what Blizzard´s been doing with the last games, his own version of an existing game.<br />

Love wow!<br />
<br />
The blanket % buff works if specs need fine tuning during a .5 or maybe mid way in a tier as a tuning pass. Developers are using it WAY TOO MUCH. <br />
<br />
It is a joke when used on feral to push up a known low parsing spec the week of a content patch. They need more attention. In general, under-performing specs (pve logs not pvp) likely have fundamental flaws or scaling issues. They could be lacking in aoe or single target. % buffs do not help solve anything. Its offsetting an issue that will reoccur at the best.</div></div><hr />

Agreed this is their 2nd time attempting to increase/expand on the faction war. It has been terrible with people complaining on both sides that X faction got something, and Y faction didnt. I'd still be ok with factions similar to Aldor/Scryers.</div></div><hr />

I think this is where we are being taken. Even though we have a faction war based expansion, I think they are trying to end the horde vs alliance fight, with void elves, light undeads (not in game but in the lore already), we are aimed at a everyone vs the void.</div></div><hr />

Not true, I spoke to horde player yesterday. You can change languages to orcish in language menu.</div></div><hr />

You should buy a crystal ball and become a fortune teller, you seem to have talent for it.</div></div><hr />

Dunno what's sadder: the current state of WoW or the people that say they are glad they are not playing this game anymore but still are wasting their time reading and replying to current wow news instead of playing their fav game :/</div></div><hr />

It's a fair guess, but not 100% accurate. <br />
I for example do not play, my sub ended 5 days ago and i dont intend to resub untill i see some changes.<br />
I played everyday since release untill about a month ago.<br />
The difference is, this is literally my first MMO post. <br />
Yes, i just made an account, i didnt need it before because i didnt comment. <br />
<br />
Back to the point - what im trying to say, that while most of &quot;im glad i dont play this game anymore&quot; people may be just saying that in hopes of blizzard seeing it, and still be playing, some aren't. And if they are still consistently reading patch notes and blue posts it may be because we're hoping for some changes that would let us still enjoy this game. <br />
<br />
Cheers.</div></div><hr />
