Blue posts<br />
Easy gear in TBC Arenas<br />
We definitely make mistakes, but you are mischaracterizing how we feel about Arena. The problem was that the initial BC Arena gear was so easy to obtain, that it attracted many players to Arenas who really had no business being in there or in fact didn't even enjoy it. They just went where the loot was. In LK, we offered the same or better loot through raiding and lots of people went raiding.<br />
<br />
We like Arena. It isn't going anywhere. We just want to reserve it for people who actually like it, not for those who feel like they have to do it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23214332010-not-understanding-the-cata-goals-and-ideals.html))<br />
<br />
AE Healing<br />
True, but many of those spells require targeting. Even PoH requires targeting. I'm not a big fan of the way Wild Growth has turned out either, but at least its hot prevents it from being the &quot;nobody dies from AE&quot; spell. Again, they are good spells, and they have their place. I wish there was more of a decision of when to use them instead of always on cooldown. I realize part of that is encounter design. Part of it may be that they are still too good. (But we aren't nerfing them anytime soon.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/23329534731-people-saying-priests-are-fine.html))<br />
<br />
Mana management and encounters difficulty<br />
Fights are designed to be hard (to a degree). If you have a proposal for how they can be hard in a different vector, please share. Running OOM is a tool that we lost and want to regain, but I suspect that will lead to a lot of &quot;Healing isn't fun anymore&quot; responses. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/23329534731-people-saying-priests-are-fine.html))<br />

Rake Bug<br />
Right. It's possible that there is server - client disagreement (because of lag) about what's going on, so that you think you can reapply Rake (because it has fallen off) but get the &quot;more powerful aura&quot; error instead.<br />
<br />
We did have a similar problem with Immolate at some point, but we fixed it by letting you clip that last tick. I don't think you would want that with Rake because it would be a dps loss when that happened. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23307930926-feral-quality-of-life-adjustments.html))<br />
<br />
Nature's Grasp in 3.3.3<br />
That's a bug. You can only cast one Entangling Roots. You can proc the roots on 3 targets with Nature's Grasp. [...] They are two different spells that just look alike.<br />
<br />
There is a small ICD to keep a rogue from blowing through all 3 charges quickly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23425553606-natures-grasp-on-the-ptr.html))<br />

Lightwell<br />
Lightwell isn't okay either. We don't want to turn it into a totem, because the class already has plenty of spells that require little interaction. We're not entirely sure what we'll do yet, but we still like the basic idea (creating something and it does the healing) so we aren't going to just scrap it.

Rake Bug<br />
Right. It's possible that there is server - client disagreement (because of lag) about what's going on, so that you think you can reapply Rake (because it has fallen off) but get the &quot;more powerful aura&quot; error instead.<br />
<br />

For those saying that the random BG system is coming out tomorrow, NO, it's not. Come on... It's for the PTR obviously..

It's probably a question you get asked a lot but why in the world did you expect anything besides that from the official forums? Any time there's been an 'official' forum for anything that's what it's degraded into. Personally it's the last place I look whenever I want information on something.<br />
1. Elitist Jerks forums.<br />
2. Ensidia Forums.<br />
3. MMO Champion Forums.<br />
4. Class-specific fan forums.<br />

<br />
Couldn't they make it similar to what the lightwell in ToC 5m does off the trash mobs in 2nd encounter? i.e. - it heals people via some instant spell [smart heal]. But they've said &quot;We don't want to turn it into a totem&quot; ...<br />
<br />
That, or make it a summonable pet, like shadowfiend, that heals people... lasts a minute, and instead of mana it has 'charges' [10, just like what the lightwell does already]], which can be auto-cast [via smart heal] or turn that off so you can select the target you want it to heal on [with a short debuff to prevent spamming it on one person consecutively maybe]... :P<br />

Yeah, they mentioned in BlizzCast they wont release it now (or soon(tm)), as they want players to be focusing on PvP. Same applies to co-op mode vs AI.<br />

There is nothing wrong with appreciating beauty, there is howevre something wrong with your aggressive attack on people.<br />

Aggresive attack on people? Saying something alike, god that girl is hot i'd spank that. I'm pretty sure she appreciates that, you low life bastard.</div></div><hr />

What quite a few people in this thread are doing is definitely not &quot;appreciating beauty&quot;...</div></div><hr />

Have they even logged into the game since then? Giving free tier 9 to people that do 5-man Heroics is even worse.<br />
<br />
<br />
they also give ilv 232 pvp gear with just honor if you forgotten</div></div><hr />

Dude in the back is totally smoking. I'd do him.<br />
<br />
<br />
You're right, I am grumpy about it &gt;:(<br />
<br />
Just to imitate what guys sound like when feasting and drooling over somebody that looks remotely nice (that they'll never have)... OMG That dude in the back is hella fine I'd do him any day any time. I bet he's got a fine ass to match those sexy arms. and OMFG he works for Blizz?!?!! that's so hot! all the other guys in the pic are fugly and disgusting but that one guy makes me want to let you all know that he's hot no matter how many times other people in the forums have already repeated it!!!!!1!11 <br />
<br />
There are men/boys in this forum that have yet to realize that most women do not fancy being treated like a piece of meat. It's great that guys can think a woman is beautiful and think that you're complimenting her with your words, but man you guys are so degrading to not just her, but yourselves as well.</div></div><hr />

So you wont see neither Tom Chilton ( Kalgan ) or Chris Metzen, simply because they arent in the community team, but instead Lead Game Designer and Vice President of Creative Development, respectfully.<br />
<br />
I'm able to identify only 3 people on the picture, the WoW CM's Nethera and Zarhym along with the Diablo III CM Bashiok ( Who was previously a WoW CM under the name of Drysc ).<br />
<br />
back row, fourth from the left is Zarhym, the 5th is Bashiok (Drysc).<br />
<br />
Neth is second from left on the front row.<br />
<br />
Also I think I might see Vaneras.<br />
<br />
But that would mean the EU CM's are there too.<br />
<br />
Edit : Found Bornakk, back row second from the left.</div></div><hr />

We definitely make mistakes, but you are mischaracterizing how we feel about Arena. The problem was that the initial BC Arena gear was so easy to obtain, that it attracted many players to Arenas who really had no business being in there or in fact didn't even enjoy it. They just went where the loot was. In LK, we offered the same or better loot through raiding and lots of people went raiding.<br />
<br />
We like Arena. It isn't going anywhere. We just want to reserve it for people who actually like it, not for those who feel like they have to do it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23214332010-not-understanding-the-cata-goals-and-ideals.html)) <br />
<br />
oh so you want only people who actually like arena to do it? Sounds good<br />
Then how about starting giving gear equal to that of arena to other PvP players who do not like arena ( instead of the second hand gear I heard you plan to give to BGers in cata) and give arena fans something else that is not gear as a reward to have something to flex their epeen with?<br />

raiding is for raiding gear not PvP gear</div></div><hr />

<br />
well blizzard...arena was enjoyable in TBC more than [Wotlk] now in Wotlk players who pvp Have to play arena if they like it or hate it ,players are changing there class to other classes that they find boring just to reach 1800 rating for a weapon.<br />
in tbc you could get weapons and range weapons and have a full pvp gear to be redy for arena.<br />
<br />
IN Wotlk you made arena as a DPS race more like going for a boss in ICC 25men and find out who is making top dps.<br />
<br />
now players use pve gear because you made them in need for hast raring [mages] and you made warriors use pve gear [armor penetration]<br />
<br />
now 3v3 and 5v5 is all about the faster class well make the big crit first.[am lying?watch a 5v5 or a 3v3 or trying being a priest in one of those[never played a priest] and you well be dominated in few seconds.<br />
<br />
make players raid for pvp?<br />
<br />
why dont we pvp and get full t10 then?<br />
<br />
<br />
you just need players to pve and you even made the pve LFG system which is cool but even with those weapons in pve [Pos axe for example] you dont get what you want from it,you removed weapons from honor and players start to whine that is hard to pve now t9 is for free so players can raid.<br />
<br />
you made t9 for free and you dont want to add pvp weapons in honor again because players afk there way to it?<br />
well i afk my way in Heroics i got full t9 in my DK mage warrior all in 5-6days that is even less than a week.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
