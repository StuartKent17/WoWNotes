Earlier this month I said that I planned to reset the Hall of Fame to reflect the recent buffs to Ulduar bosses. After a few days I actually changed my mind and decided to keep it as it is now and not change it. All guilds had access to the nerfed version at the same time and we can't really create a new ranking everytime a boss is changed, we would just create one every day. <br />
<br />
The Hall of Fame (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=864) is now up to date, but I would like to mention a few kills of the buffed versions of the hard modes:<br />
Method (http://www.methodwow.com/) killed the buffed version of Freya's hard mode. <br />
Ensidia (http://www.ensidia.com/home/news/Ensidia-Ulduar-Hardmode.html) killed Freya a bit later, and also Thorim during the same night. <br />
For The Horde (http://www.for-the-horde.eu/) killed Thorim as well.<br />
<br />
Replenishment Change For Arenas<br />
We are making a hotfix (any minute now probably) so that Replenishment in arenas will only affect the character and not the whole team. It will continue to function as it does currently outside of arenas.<br />
<br />
We feel Replenishment is balanced for larger groups, but just makes too much of a difference on smaller arena teams. Making the rules work differently in PvP and PvE isn’t a solution we like to use often, but in this case we think it fixes the issue cleanly, while still making the talents in question useful to the character who takes them. Alternatives, such as nerfing the amount returned by Replenishment in arena or making it not function at all, seem like more punitive choices from which we want to stay away. <br />
<br />
Recent In-Game Fixes - 04/23<br />
Listed below are recent fixes we have applied to the game. Keep in mind that some of these changes may not be active until after the realm has been restarted. <br />
<br />
Fear Ward will now properly be consumed whether a player is sitting or standing.<br />
The Rogue talent Savage Combat should now properly be removed after leaving an arena match.<br />
Greater Blessing of Wisdom and Mana Spring Totem will no longer stack as intended.<br />
The trash mobs before XT-002 Deconstructor have gone through additional changes that should make them a little easier to get through.<br />
The Ocular in Icecrown should be killable again using the quest item Eyesoar Blaster.<br />
The quests &quot;Shatter the Shards&quot; and &quot;The Guardians of Corp'rethar” should be completable again whether or not you are involved in Argent Tournament quests.<br />
The trash mobs before Mimiron have gone through additional changes that should make them a little easier to get through.<br />
The Priest ability Serendipity is now properly consumed when a spell finishes casting and does not affect a second spell.<br />
Nature’s Swiftness should properly affect Rebirth.<br />
The damage of XT-002 Deconstructor’s Gravity Bomb ability has been reduced.<br />
<br />

Mana regeneration in 3.1<br />
You are rarely in a situation to compare Int and Spirit directly. More often you are choosing say Spirit vs. Crit, and Crit is already much better for Balance druids. I don't know that many priests really stack Spirit because of the Innervate potential, so a change like this wouldn't affect them much (though I get your point overall).<br />
<br />
Really though the greater issue is that we don't put a lot of regen stats on PvP gear, and ultimately we don't want to. That makes Innervate a lot better in PvE than PvP. PvP Balance druids seem to have mana problems. Solving that through Innervate, the ability you get that, you know, is supposed to give you mana, is an attractive solution.<br />
<br />
This is a bigger discussion, but we have muddied the waters by converting Int into a regen stat and Spirit into a damage stat for so many casters. Long term, we would like to clean that up somewhat. Regen in general has always been just a little too confusing in WoW. We think we can make it a more straight-forward concept without losing any depth. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474162276-pvp-moonkin-mana-regen-is-utterly-broken.html))<br />

Stealth nerfs in 3.1? <br />
A true stealth nerf would be something we were trying to hide, or at least waiting to see if players discovered it. There aren't many changes like that, particularly in this day and age. When we make hotfixes, we are patching the server. This isn't a big orchestrated change like launching a new client patch so we don't always know the exact minute or second when the change goes in.<br />
<br />
If it's something we intended, we'll let you know pretty quickly. If it's a bug, we'll let you know once we figure out if it's going on.<br />
<br />
We made changes to Conflagrate, Death Strike and Exorcism lately. We have not made any changes to shaman damage, hunter trap arming time or many of the other questions that have popped up lately. If any of those are bugs, we'll let you know as we verify that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474152752-i-didnt-know-the-customer-had-to-ask.html))<br />

Innervate<br />
Part of the problem is that Innervate scales with buffs. So we can either have it give too much mana in PvE or too little in PvP. Right now it's the latter -- we're pretty happy with Balance mana regen in Ulduar, but it's too low in PvP.<br />
<br />
We'd like to make a change where Innervate always restrores about the same total mana (say 15,000 at level 80). That's good for PvP but not overpowered for PvE, and has the added bonus of being more useful to non-Spirit based casters as well. &quot;Innervating the hunter!&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474162276-pvp-moonkin-mana-regen-is-utterly-broken.html))<br />

Paladin mechanics<br />
We're not talking about combo points here. But we keep running into problems with say Judgement, Divine Storm, Crusader Strike, and now (until recently) Exorcism and perhaps even Hammer of Wrath all being unrelated. You can use one per global cooldown leading to just a ton of damage without there being much an opponent can really do. There is no poison or disease to cleanse. There isn't a self buff someone can remove. They often don't even have time to respond because the attacks are coming right on top of each other. Yes the abilities all have cooldowns, but that's small consolation to someone who may be in triple digit health by the time you unload.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it's not like there is much skill involved to that rotation (&quot;GC SEZ RETS R FACEROLLERZ&quot;). You hit the buttons and damage happens. Sure you can come up with other situations where a player just hits their buttons and unloads a lot, but in a lot of cases they do have other considerations to deal with. Warriors have to watch Overpower opportunities. Enhancement shamans want to follow up Stormstrike with Nature damage. Frost mages want the Frost Nova (or whatever) before the Ice Lance.<br />
<br />
To some extent, Holy paladins even have the same issues. Simple does not have to mean boring. Having few buttons doesn't have to mean having few options.<br />
<br />
Again, we've come a long way with paladins. Their aren't horribly broken. No class is. They just need a little more tweaking. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16473622306-concerns-about-ret.html))<br />

A lot of guilds have managed this including ours.. they nerfed the fight so hard if you can't get the 4 min kill you need to re-evaluate your life. Cause.. that HP nerf is just wtf.</div></div><hr />

I do not care about anything else in WoW anymore, they could make the paladin a class where all it does is /dance instead of attack as far as I care. I have Peggle. It's ok.<br />

<br />
Isnt this like a pretty huge game mechanic change for PVP? I mean, ive specced into replenishment talents so both me and my teamm8s can make use of it. If they are gonna nerf it so it only applies to myself, i might consider putting those 2 talents elsewhere since i have different ways to get mana back being a Hunter. This proves to me that Blizzard has no clue in what they are doing, and are hotfixing a major game mechanic just like that. Can i get a free respec then?<br />
<br />
It looks like they are watching how arena matches go on live servers now (since PTR is a HORRIBLE place to balance PVP) and then randomly decide, lets nerf this, lets buff that, lets nerf replenishment etc.. see how that turns out. They always, and have always overly buffed sertain classes while overly nerfing others in a major content patch, and are now trying to hotfix their incompetance. Why cant they see in advance (like the thousands of arena players can) that nerfing 1 class is actually buffing other classes vs that 1 class. But they keep buffing the other classes cause they were underpowered, while nerfing overpowered = underpowered becomes overpowered, and overpowered becomes underpowered.<br />
Besides, replenishment works fine in large groups they say, so it works fine in Heroics, but not in 5v5 Arena? Just get rid the proven fact that 2v2 is a failure for arena, and has been for over 5 seasons, and will be failure in this season as well. Just get rid of it and introduce 4v4 allready, or let ppl have the choice to have 3x a 3v3. Get rid of 5v5 as well, its a zerg fest without any means of tactic. My 5v5 was best on server horde side, and we totally sucked. <br />
<br />
It also seems weird to me that they 1st said that they didnt want Arena to become a &quot;mana&quot; game, and said that players should be able to lose without being completly oom. And now they are compeltly contradicting themselves with removing team replenishment in arena. So, is this gonna be a Melee season yet again where mana-less players can keep on spamming their dps while mana classes have to actually think what and what not to spend their mana on?<br />
<br />
Oh, and they overbuffed Warriors, Druids (resto) and Disc priests, they are now the fotm classes for S6.</div></div><hr />

The mini games are great for FP's or waiting for someone who's AFK in your instance! I have been playing bejeweled on FP's for a long time now :D<br />

Plus it's always fun to try and beat guildies scores.<br />

I don't think anyone would actually log onto wow to play the mini game however.<br />

that's fucking stupid, seriously. it's not fixing the class, it's making it worst, because if you're enemy know if they remove it, they win, what do you think they are gonna try?.. <br />
<br />
Think before you do something blizz. same for retribution. I can't get a higher crit than 5k in full pve gear, with both trinket proccing, ending with 6k AP, on a dummy with ZERO reslience.. that's retarded. best you can crit healers in arena is around 3.5k, how do you want to kill one? with substain dps, countered by substain hots? seriously lame.</div></div><hr />

That just makes it more challenging, doesn't it? You can't just use it at any random time and get all your mana back. Besides as said above compared to Mage's with Evocate you're off good.</div></div><hr />

Yes it is really hard to Sheep, CS, Frost Nova, Deep Freeze, Slow+Blink behind a pillar and reset all you're CDs when the 1st attempt failed so you can use Evocation to get back to almost full hp and mana. /sarcasm.</div></div><hr />

Furthermore, it's not like there is much skill involved to that rotation (&quot;GC SEZ RETS R FACEROLLERZ&quot;). You hit the buttons and damage happens.<br />

Btw, new patch data is here, 3.1.2: &quot;Replenishment effect now only works on pets*&quot;<br />

<br />
We feel Replenishment is balanced for larger groups, but just makes too much of a difference on smaller arena teams. Making the rules work differently in PvP and PvE isn’t a solution we like to use often, but in this case we think it fixes the issue cleanly, while still making the talents in question useful to the character who takes them. Alternatives, such as nerfing the amount returned by Replenishment in arena or making it not function at all, seem like more punitive choices from which we want to stay away. <br />
<br />
I'd like to reply this blue in the WoW forums but sadly my account is EU and this is in US forums...<br />
I just wonder how stupid this sounds for me once again. I mean: casters have to worry about mana while melees can rush mindlessly regaining their powers automatically. If you also sum that exist several do-not-cast mechanics (counters, reflects, silences...), apart from the normal crowd controls that affect everone, while phisical attacks can't be prevented. If anyone proposed &quot;Curse of Drop-your-weapons&quot; or &quot;Bless of if-you-touch-the-priest-you-can-be-insta-mind-controlled-and-attack-your-mates&quot; or Invisibility working as a Cloak of Shadows phisical style... well that person would be called crazy...<br />
Also I'm wondering why is this such a big need to fix while Blizzard allows shamans' heroism for a whole group in arenas when one of the biggest problems nowadays is rushing...</div></div><hr />

Isnt this like a pretty huge game mechanic change for PVP? I mean, ive specced into replenishment talents so both me and my teamm8s can make use of it. If they are gonna nerf it so it only applies to myself, i might consider putting those 2 talents elsewhere since i have different ways to get mana back being a Hunter. This proves to me that Blizzard has no clue in what they are doing, and are hotfixing a major game mechanic just like that. Can i get a free respec then?<br />
<br />
It looks like they are watching how arena matches go on live servers now (since PTR is a HORRIBLE place to balance PVP) and then randomly decide, lets nerf this, lets buff that, lets nerf replenishment etc.. see how that turns out. They always, and have always overly buffed sertain classes while overly nerfing others in a major content patch, and are now trying to hotfix their incompetance. Why cant they see in advance (like the thousands of arena players can) that nerfing 1 class is actually buffing other classes vs that 1 class. But they keep buffing the other classes cause they were underpowered, while nerfing overpowered = underpowered becomes overpowered, and overpowered becomes underpowered.<br />
Besides, replenishment works fine in large groups they say, so it works fine in Heroics, but not in 5v5 Arena? Just get rid the proven fact that 2v2 is a failure for arena, and has been for over 5 seasons, and will be failure in this season as well. Just get rid of it and introduce 4v4 allready, or let ppl have the choice to have 3x a 3v3. Get rid of 5v5 as well, its a zerg fest without any means of tactic. My 5v5 was best on server horde side, and we totally sucked. <br />
<br />
It also seems weird to me that they 1st said that they didnt want Arena to become a &quot;mana&quot; game, and said that players should be able to lose without being completly oom. And now they are compeltly contradicting themselves with removing team replenishment in arena. So, is this gonna be a Melee season yet again where mana-less players can keep on spamming their dps while mana classes have to actually think what and what not to spend their mana on?<br />
<br />
Oh, and they overbuffed Warriors, Druids (resto) and Disc priests, they are now the fotm classes for S6.<br />
<br />
<br />
While warriors did receive some much needed utility for S6, they still lack a pummel in battle stance and still need more on demand burst. I'm lucky if my MS crits for 3k.<br />
The problem with shield bash in battle stance is gear/weapon swap which creates a gcd.<br />
Since Blizzard wants us to stay in battle, it makes it harder. Charging for interrupts will probably have to do for now.<br />
<br />
Warriors are still easy to train and bladestorm is avoidable. But S6 is definitely a lot better for warriors than S5. Saying that warriors are op in S6 though is something that just isn't true.<br />
<br />
And with people comparing Ret Paladin/Priest to DK/Pal in S5, I think the replenishment changes were needed. My lowly rogue/mage team stood not a chance.<br />
<br />
I will, however, come out and say that while Magss and several other rogue heroes pointed out rogues received no insane damage buff, they still do feel a little overpowered. And definitely much more so than the warrior I've played as my main for the last four years.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure no one intends to log into WoW just to play peggle. I'm sure you've had downtime every now and then. Even 30s BG res timers. The game is autopaused on closing so even in 30s spurts you can shoot a few balls or two in your peggle game and amuse yourself instead of staring blankly at the spirit healer for 30s.<br />

Something about mana regen being nerfed and therefore making replenishment that much more valuable and so any team without it gets boinked.</div></div><hr />

(http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Paladin mechanics<br />
We're not talking about combo points here. But we keep running into problems with say Judgement, Divine Storm, Crusader Strike, and now (until recently) Exorcism and perhaps even Hammer of Wrath all being unrelated. You can use one per global cooldown leading to just a ton of damage without there being much an opponent can really do. There is no poison or disease to cleanse. There isn't a self buff someone can remove. They often don't even have time to respond because the attacks are coming right on top of each other. Yes the abilities all have cooldowns, but that's small consolation to someone who may be in triple digit health by the time you unload.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, it's not like there is much skill involved to that rotation (&quot;GC SEZ RETS R FACEROLLERZ&quot;). You hit the buttons and damage happens. Sure you can come up with other situations where a player just hits their buttons and unloads a lot, but in a lot of cases they do have other considerations to deal with. Warriors have to watch Overpower opportunities. Enhancement shamans want to follow up Stormstrike with Nature damage. Frost mages want the Frost Nova (or whatever) before the Ice Lance.<br />
<br />
To some extent, Holy paladins even have the same issues. Simple does not have to mean boring. Having few buttons doesn't have to mean having few options.<br />
<br />
Again, we've come a long way with paladins. Their aren't horribly broken. No class is. They just need a little more tweaking. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16473622306-concerns-about-ret.html))[/blizzquote]<br />
<br />
A ton of damage without there being much an opponent can do...because ret pallies have an MS and interrupt right? Any healer can heal through it unless they get caught in a cc chain at the wrong time or in a stun when they're low without a trinket.</div></div><hr />

For when you're waiting in battleground queues, flying long distances (dailies / mooncloth transmutes), waiting for AFKers, waiting for raid leader to do tactics, waiting for people to get themselves to the instance, waiting for buffs, waiting for a res, I could go on but you get the idea.<br />
It's actually quite well made, it auto-closes when you have a ready check or get put in combat.</div></div><hr />
