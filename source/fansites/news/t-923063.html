World of Warcraft update 4.2, Rage of the Firelands, will introduce the first new raid tier in Cataclysm, and with that it will also introduce the first conversion from Valor Points to Justice Points. For anyone running Heroics and raids, this is important information to ensure you spend your points wisely before release of the patch.<br />
<br />
With the release of patch 4.2 all Valor Points will be converted down to Justice Points up to the 4000 point cap, with any points over the cap being converted to gold at a rate of 47 silver per point. In addition, all previous Tier 11 Valor items will now be purchasable with Justice from the Justice Point vendors, and new Tier 12 Valor items will be available from the Valor vendors.<br />
<br />
For example: I have 3300 Justice Points and 1600 Valor Points. Upon logging in after 4.2 releases I’ll see that my Valor has been down-converted to Justice; I now have 4000 Justice Points and 0 Valor Points. 900 of my Valor Points were over the 4000 point cap, they converted at a rate of 47 silver per point (.47x900), and so I received 423 gold as compensation.<br />
<br />
The maximum you can have is 4000 Justice points, and Justice will be able to buy Tier 11 gear, so it’s important to go ahead and spend Valor before 4.2 if the conversion would take you over the 4000-point Justice cap and you have no need for the gold.<br />

Clarification: Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/)<br />
Dragonwrath is designed to be DOT-friendly. Simply put, it has a chance to copy each tick of a DOT spell. There is no internal cooldown, since we want it to be good for warlocks and Shadow priests.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the proc chance is adjusted favorably for pet specs that derive a significant portion of their DPS from pets.<br />
<br />
Our goal is to tune Dragonwrath in such a way that you can give it to any caster without anticipating certain classes or specs getting a bigger benefit than others.

I can't find the quote at the moment, but I believe that it was confirmed that if the previous T11 required a token, that token is still required to purchase, alongside the JP requirement</div></div><hr />

If a mage try to act like its a bad tank and dont do much dps to be sure he wont agro, then its a sucky mage that cant hold his dps up. <br />
I seen tanks that after a mage hold back his dps in 2 sec before hitting loose agro several times too, and then blame the mage anyways. It's getting out of hand this hate now...</div></div><hr />

Seems to be to be pretty accurate, though, the mage mains I know don't and wouldn't play a tank.<br />
At least as a tank you have the power to let the bad mage die. <br />
A good aggro-whore mage is harder though, between iceblock, images, invis, kiting, images, iceblock, kiting...but he'll figure out that that hurts his dps.</div></div><hr />

On the tank issue, not sure how the convo came about but if a mage can pull threat from a tank.. the tanks gotta go!<br />
I have only ever had issues with a lock pulling threat off me and thats been VERY VERY few times, and I actually end up hitting soul shatter all the time on my aff lock so I can understand that. I MT raids on 2 pally tanks and can honestly say no one comes close to threat, not even better geared mages, so something is seriously up. If you're taking threat from a tank and its an AoE situation, thats a different story and really isn't a reason at all to brag since you're a nub and don't know what tank assist is. <br />
<br />
Speaking of locks... the whole paragraph about Dragonwrath not benefitting anyone over anyone else (DPS), is a load of crock and shows these morons have no idea what they're talking about...<br />
IE he said it will double EACH tick of A dot and/or a spell (single spell from a mage i take it)... there is in no way you can equate the doubling a DOT and any spell (even if its a mage spell that hits for 30K on average) since a dot from an aff lock can crit for 12k already!! Do the math, what happens on a dot that normal ticks for 6 9 9 9 12 9 ??? (for example but you get the point) Thats a TON of damage! Don't know for sure about spriest dots i havent played my priest in forever but this just smells like bad news for aff locks (cause i bet they'll nerf us again).<br />
<br />
Not even going to go into the lack of ICD because spriests and locks have insane uptime on dots (at least good ones).</div></div><hr />

Might merit further inquiry, but I am sure the Blue meant, there's a chance for every single, seperate tick to be copied. Otherwise his clarification about no GCD would not matter (as much).</div></div><hr />

I'd be impressed if anyone managed to &quot;cap out&quot; Valor points. Just think, if only we'd saved the maximum possible 28 weeks x 1250 VP we'd be able to get 16,450g, then we could laugh at all those people who foolishly squandered theirs on selling BoE boots or (perish the thought!) actually bought gear with it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then why are you holding on to those VP?<br />
Do the math, with the automatic conversion (assuming you're JP capped), 5000 × .47 = 2,350 g<br />
So, if you're holding out on VP, this conversion is NOT a good thing for you. You're better off selling some BoE boots, which go for at least 3k, maybe less depending on the server (though, I doubt it's gonna be less than 1k). You can get at least 3k to 9k by doing this instead of letting your points get converted.<br />
<br />
And for those complaining about the Daily Blink's &quot;hate&quot; on mages, you do know the guy who makes them plays a mage main, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hunters, mages, boomkins, priests and warlocks can be just as lazy with the boys that play them. In fact I find the girls that play these classes to be far more attentive to their class than the boys. You really should look into that arrogant jerk problem you have.<br />
<br />
On topic the daily blink is predictable and boring. As a tank if I lose aggro it's almost always to warriors or hunters. <br />
<br />
Please daily blink get a new shtick</div></div><hr />

My guess is it applies to dot ticks instead of spells because of the way SWP and Corruption work.<br />
Imagine you apply SWP and it doubles the spell, you can effecgtively keep both spells up with MF.<br />
Same for Warlocks with Corruption through Haunt/Drain Life/Whatever other spell refreshes the dot.<br />
While I understand the reasoning behind it, a copy of one tick of a spell is not really that amazing.<br />
<br />
With the rate dots tick at it will probablyh result in the same gain but I'm still a bit dubious until I've actually seen it in action</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 minute on dummy (4x AB rotation + arcane missiles) (not buffed etc)<br />
28 arcane blasts <br />
30 arcane missiles<br />
<br />
= 58 'ticks'<br />
<br />
1 minute shadowpriest (dots up , mindflay , few MBs, note better geared then mage)<br />
44 ticks of mindflay<br />
24 VT<br />
3 MB<br />
24 SWP<br />
24 DP<br />
<br />
= 119 ticks<br />
<br />
i've been told that it the staff will probably have 6% proc rate (can someone verify this?) is it safe to assume the staff will proc approx 3 times on the mage and about 6 times on the shadowpriest ? <br />
<br />
<br />
At first I thought it would duplicate a whole spell but I think its more logical and balanced if it turns out to work somewhat like this? or am I totally wrong..? :p</div></div><hr />

Caustic and Delia - I like how you both dwell only on the female part of Glaxton's comment and conveniently ignore that he said something bad about guys too. Dying to be another victim of some &quot;sexist joke&quot; are we? lol<br />
<br />
We likely took offense to the female part because he basically states that all girls are terrible and the only way they can do good damage is to play an easy class. And the &quot;bad&quot; thing he says about males is that the unskilled ones play easy classes, implying that their are skilled males, but no skilled females...<br />
<br />
Its not playing a victim card when being offended by an outright sexist remark...<br />
<br />
It'd be like if I said:<br />
All men are idiots... but so are stupid women...<br />
<br />
Its ok that I insulted all men, cause I said stupid women were idiots too!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tank:&quot;What the hell guys I have to do so much Grr&quot; <br />
<br />
DPS &quot; OK i'll stay here but move when this happens, CC that guy, DPS an insane amount on this guy while killing this add when he spawns, be told to interrupt 7 times when my one interupt is on cooldown, then get blamed for everything when you can't hold agrro&quot;<br />
<br />
Healer: &quot; Yep I'll keep myself, the tank and 3 dps alive, CC and sometimes have to DPS a &quot;super&quot; add when it comes in&quot;<br />
<br />
Tank: &quot;Good, I'll spam agrro hits, fail many times to hold agrro while demanding more dps, blame the healer when my gear is shitty and lose 50% of my HP on every hit and blame DPS for every other mistake, then have the arrogance to roll need on DPS gear because my instant queues and extra goodie bag now aren't enough. Jeez you guys are failures...&quot;<br />
<br />
In any LFD group I have been in the wipes caused by arrogant tanks have easily outnumbered the wipes caused by 4 other players usually out of mere arrogance or bad play not because content is hard for tanks. Wrath spoiled everybody, tanks walked through dungeons while dps didn't have to CC, now CC is vital but a tank paying attention instead of complaining is hard to find.</div></div><hr />

LOL, such a poor victim. Please. He didn't say a class that 'ALL girls play to be good in dps&quot;. <br />
I'll help you understand it.<br />
<br />
If a girl is playing a mage (in his opinion) it's because it's an easy class to do dps iwhile facerolling.<br />
<br />
If a guy is playing a mage (in his opinion) it's because they have no skill and still can do good dps.<br />
<br />
You're jumping to conclusions because as I said earlier, you're dying to be a victim.....</div></div><hr />
