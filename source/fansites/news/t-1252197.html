Change is coming to PvP gear in the relatively near future, and we wanted to provide a not-so-brief update on the improvements we’re planning, while pulling the curtain aside a bit so you can see the thought processes that motivated the coming changes. We also thought this would also be a great time to get the World of Warcraft PvP community involved in the discussion.<br />
<br />
The Challenges<br />
There are a few main issues that we’re working to address within the next couple of patches:<br />
<br />
Early Advantage<br />
Currently, it’s very common for players that have a head start at the start of the season to earn the best gear quickly and gain a dominating position on the ladder with a very high Match Making Rating (MMR). It’s then pretty common for those players to only participate on the ladder in a minimal way before reaping their rewards at the very end of the season. That’s not particularly good for competition, and we don’t think that it’s a very fun way for a competitive ladder to work. We would like to see the ladder remain active, and for high ranking players to earn their positions throughout the season, instead of just blitzing early and camping a spot above a certain threshold.<br />
<br />
Mid-season Start<br />
Players getting into PvP mid-season face a very significant challenge to gear up and become competitive because players that started earlier in the season are so far ahead in terms of gear. We want to make it more reasonable for a player to join in on organized PvP mid-season, while still rewarding the commitment of players that have remained invested in PvP throughout the season.<br />
<br />
Rating Requirements<br />
The current rating requirements on PvP gear create an artificially sharp division between players over 2200 rating and those below that rating threshold, which is unduly difficult to cross. We’d prefer that teams progress up the ladder on a curve against gradually more difficult opponents, instead of running into a wall at a certain rating.<br />
<br />
Gear Advantage<br />
Over time, the gap in power between Honor and Conquest PvP items has widened. This happened, in part, because it’s necessary for us to preserve the balance in power between PvP and PvE gear so that one doesn’t become the most obvious path to victory for the other. Right now, there are four tiers of PvE items, but only two tiers of PvP items. To keep Honor items from being the best choice for entry into PvE, they needed to have a lower item level than equivalent Raid Finder items. At the same time, Conquest gear still needs to be better for PvP than Heroic raid items, which puts it way over on the opposite end of the power scale from its Honor counterpart. While there are items that bridge the gap between Raid Finder and Heroic Raid loot, there really haven’t been any PvP items to bridge the gap between Honor and Conquest gear. We plan to solve that problem by introducing new tiers of PvP items, changing which currencies it takes to buy items and when, and by making PvP weapons more readily available in general.<br />
<br />
Flexibility<br />
While the item upgrade system has the benefit of allowing players that have “finished” their PvP set to continue to progress their character’s power, because there’s built-in pressure to continue upgrading their main set, it also means that players don’t always feel comfortable spending those points on alternate sets of gear for different specs (though it’s worth mentioning that the upgrade system will be disabled for patch 5.2). We’d like to make it easier for players in this position to experiment with alternate specs and stats.<br />
<br />
Moving Forward<br />
Meeting these challenges will mean that some changes are coming to MMR, PvP gear, and how gear is earned and paid for:<br />
<br />
Team Rating Inflation<br />
As we’ve mentioned previously, we want to see the ladder rankings decided toward the end of a season, and not a foregone conclusion dictated by what happens at the start. As discussed in the PvP in Mists of Pandaria Dev Watercooler, as of patch 5.2 Team Rating will gradually increase as players participate in PvP over the course of the season. We expect the new system to help ensure that the ladder remains active at all ratings and that the competition stays fierce from start to finish.<br />
<br />
Gear Changes<br />
To accomplish the goals of making PvP more accessible and less punishing, gearing more consistent and flexible, and flattening the power curve out over the course of a season, there are some significant changes in the works:<br />
<br />
2200 rating requirements removed from all PvP gear. (5.2)<br />
Gear will be available in four tiers:<br />
<br />
Dreadful Gladiator’s (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Dreadful+Gladiator) gear will be crafted. (5.2)<br />
Malevolent Gladiator’s (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Malevolent+Gladiator) gear, including weapons, will be purchased with Honor Points. (5.2)<br />
New tier of PvP items: Tyrannical Gladiator’s gear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Tyrannical+Gladiator) will be purchased with Conquest Points. (5.2)<br />
Tyrannical Gladiator’s gear can be purchased for Honor after 27000 Conquest Points are earned for the season. (5.3)<br />
Elite Tyrannical Gladiator’s gear can only be purchased with Conquest Points after 27,000 Conquest Points have been earned for the season. (5.2)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The 2200 rating requirements on gear will be removed in patch 5.2, and when that happens, the only barrier to acquiring top of the line Elite gear will be the 27,000 Conquest Point seasonal currency requirement. While highly rated players will still earn gear more quickly, there won’t be an invisible wall to progression at 2200 rating.<br />
<br />
As of patch 5.3, patches that don’t include the start of a new season will offer players the opportunity to purchase Conquest Point weapons without first meeting the seasonal currency requirement for them. We’re relaxing these restrictions because, by the mid-point of the season, the restriction has served its purpose and is no longer necessary. It’s worth noting here that the 27,000 Conquest Points earned requirement must always be met to buy Elite armor and weapons in every season.<br />
<br />
In terms of relative power, we’re tuning the item levels, PvP Power, and Resilience on the new set of PvP items so that the difference between Malevolent and Elite Tyrannical Gladiator’s gear is similar to the relationship between this season’s Dreadful and Malevolent Gladiator’s gear. This helps accomplish the goal of smoothing out the power curve by adding a tier in the middle of the PvP gear spectrum. Also, to add choices and flexibility, once the seasonal currency requirement is met, players will have the option to purchase Tyrannical pieces for Honor, which should allow players to more easily experiment with alternate stat loadouts and specs.<br />
<br />
Mid-Season Catch Up<br />
Players who are starting their journey into PvP mid-season start significantly behind the gearing curve. While we want to avoid invalidating the effort of players that have competed for the whole season, we agree with the feedback we’ve received that the starting gap is too large, so a new Conquest Point catch-up cap will be implemented using the following formula:<br />
<br />
(Current week of the season) * 1000 – (Conquest earned thus far this season)<br />
<br />
Here are some examples of how this will work:<br />
<br />
Player A is starting PvP for the first time in week 10 of the season, and hasn’t earned any Conquest Points at all that season. He will have an additional cap of 10,000 points added to his normal weekly rating based cap.<br />
<br />
Player B has already earned 5,000 Conquest Points by week 10, so she would have an additional cap of 5,000 points added to her normal weekly rating based cap.<br />
<br />
Player C has been playing all season long, and has earned more than 10,000 Conquest Points by week 10. He only has the normal weekly cap to work with (but should already be on their way to being well geared).<br />
<br />
If a player “redeems” their catch up cap by earning all those points, then they’ll begin the next week at their normal weekly rating based cap. Should they miss more weeks, then the catch up cap accrues again.<br />
<br />
So, to sum up the planned changes for Patch 5.2:<br />
<br />
Rating requirements will be removed from PvP gear.<br />
Malevolent Gladiator’s gear, including weapons, will be available for purchase with Honor Points.<br />
A new tier of Conquest Point gear will be added that becomes available once 27000 Conquest Points have been earned for the season.<br />
Team Rating will gradually increase during the season for teams and players that continue to compete in PvP. This system is explained in the Mists of Pandaria PvP Dev Watercooler.<br />
<br />
<br />
And here are the specific changes that are planned to hit in Patch 5.3:<br />
<br />
In patches that don’t include a new season (including patch 5.3), the seasonal currency requirement of 27,000 Conquest Points earned will be lifted from weapons. The seasonal currency requirement must always be met to purchase Elite items, though.<br />
Once the seasonal currency requirement is met, players will be able to purchase Tyrannical Gladiator’s gear with Honor Points.<br />
The Conquest Point catch up cap will be introduced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusions<br />
Overall, we expect that these changes will create a more active and competitive PvP environment, narrow the gear gap between the highest rated players and those still working their way up the ladder, and open the door for more experimentation in terms of class or spec.<br />
We look forward to hearing your opinions and feedback on these upcoming changes!</div></div><hr />

Did you not read the Part were you can earn X (weeks) x 1000 more honor for each week your not playing ? I could Grind out Arena matches as a catch up method.<br />

<br />
I think they only really had two goals<br />
<br />
1. Easier catch-up<br />
2. Prevent people from 2200ing the first few weeks, and then playing minimally until the end of the season<br />
<br />
The 2200 thing never made sense, it was just a huge jump that then gave you a big advantage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll still be far behind the wintraders who have a 3.5k cap every week... Wintraders and high skilled players will have t2 weapon with a full conquest cap by week 10, then fill our pockets with cp so we can instantly upgrade all our gear when 5.3 hits and still dominate people due gear differences.<br />
<br />
And people will still have to play a minimal amount of games, rating get higher, so the people they meet are worse, thus easy wins.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shampro</div><div class="date">2013-01-18, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is overall a REALLY good way to not make gear the make or break for returning players, while still haveing the incentive of obtaining new Gear once you reach the 27k points. And this basicly solves people sitting at 2200 and then stop playing, it basicly means the season at the end will be REALLY competitive for higher rated players, While STILL makeing it very accessible for returning players.<br />
<br />
People who are mad by this, make me happy. Those are usually people that pick on lesser geared ppl, but arent exacly skilled. THIS balances gear overall, WHILE STILL haveing the incentive of titles and mounts for higher rated players, I love it. Looks like it will work out well on live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I totally like the changes, all of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They didn't change anything to that.<br />
You'll have honor gear<br />
conquest gear<br />
elite conquest gear<br />
<br />
and in 5.3, you can upgrade all of it. Nothing changed, people that started late just get more conquest and you no longer need a rating for elite gear, which doesn't really matter since wintraders/pros will get it weeks/months before any other player gets it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crevox</div><div class="date">2013-01-18, 02:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All this is going to do is make PVP players complain that the best PVP gear in the game can be gotten by anyone that just makes sure they cap their conquest. It means there is no gear for people that are good at the game, and any random dood can get the best gear simply by playing PVP.<br />
<br />
Even though I don't PVP anymore (rarely, I dislike WoW PVP) even I think it's a pretty dumb idea to remove the high end goal for players to shoot for. There are a lot of players that PVP because they enjoy it and they want to get a high rating, but there are also that bunch of people (some of which are in the other bunch as well) that have that rating as a goal to strive for, so they can get new, powerful gear. Now, just like EVERYTHING ELSE IN THIS GAME, it's a time gated reward. You can cap your conquest for the week, but no matter how much you play, you will not be getting that gear until you play for the next however many weeks. <br />
<br />
This also doesn't really change the problem that people that have elite gear have a powerful advantage over the people that don't have it. Previously this simply meant that the 2200+ rating players would have it, but now you're going to be competing against people that have it below that rating.. making it even more difficult to get up in rating until you finish getting past the time gates to get it yourself. This solution fulfills Blizzard's goals more than anyone else; you are forced to play the game EVERY SINGLE WEEK from patch start if you want to stay relevant in the PVP scene. All it does is apply their current PVE mentality (dailies, etc) to PVP.<br />
<br />
IN ADDITION, PVE players now have a very good reason to PVP (even simply for the sake of capping conquest) due to the ridiculously high item level gear they will be able to easily obtain regardless of their skill level. This is because, for some reason in this expansion, PVP gear is just as good for PVE as PVE gear is. All they have to do is enter PVP and roll their face across the keyboard and they'll eventually be &quot;elite.&quot;<br />
<br />
Agreed there was a problem, but think this is not the best solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope, only 15 weeks for the average player that just caps arena, 13 if you cap bg as well... On the other hand, people with 3.5k caps only need 7-8 weeks for it.<br />
<br />
Gotta love numbers like that, shows how quickly the average player will get behind anyone that players RBG/arena on a high rank.</div></div><hr />

But, Blizzard thinks this game is an RPG and there should always be a system in which you get better equipment. They think that is a fundamental feature of the game that is enjoyable and should exist.<br />
<br />
They are not wrong, but this is not the right solution.</div></div><hr />

Yep it is, it may not be the 100% fix, but it is completely better than what we have now :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, ahahahahahahahahaha at all the elitis crying that they wont stomp ppl just because they have better gear, now they actually may have to use a bit of skill hahahaha. Like the guy above me for example XD</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fleps</div><div class="date">2013-01-18, 02:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is a nice move, very nice.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of players will be upset by this because of the mentality of &quot;rewards&quot; that PvP is on WoW and others MMO's, but I beg you to remember how PvP works on other game styles, such BF, CoD and many more: there is upgrades that requires you to play and get high ranks, but once everyone is there, its when the real thing matters: skills.<br />
<br />
Doesn't matter if the guy has the same gear than you, if you are good you will still win. It will only be more difficult (I call it challenge) and sometimes close fights (wayyyy more fun) <br />
<br />
And you will still be able to faceroll people on bad gear on world pvp. <br />

<br />
They are not wrong, but this is not the right solution.<br />
<br />
I agree with them. This has been the basis for the core of WoW's design forever. The only people that are in favor of implementing that are those that think they would suddenly win more often with equal gear. Those people are likely wrong. They would just move on to class balance being the reason they lose.<br />
<br />
Seriously, if you like that system better people, go play GW2. Don't make this whole game change just to suit you. You might want to find a game that already suits you, it will make you much happier.</div></div><hr />

I still feel like this is too little and too late. Those that enjoy competition and competitive play will lust for mores changes like this. Those that enjoy a pathetic circlejerk used only to make themselves feel better about their time dumped into the game will cry.</div></div><hr />

I have no idea why either. In PvE it makes no sense to casualize gear. In PvP the only reason you wouldn't want it casualized is to stroke your ego, which is absolutely irrelevant to good game design. PvP should be as accessible as it can be, and let skill factor settle the rest. That's really all there is to it.<br />
<br />
I've been nearly 2700 and achieved Glad 2 times and I fully support giving every player the same gear I have ever had. And you know why? Because I can still trounce them with my skill any day, but their enjoyment in PvP will skyrocket, and that can only be a good thing.</div></div><hr />

This, pretty much. From ranking, comes the actual incentive. Which is titles and mounts. And those incentives are still 100% in :).

<br />
100% agreed. However, I do think they do need to add some more cosmetic piece upgrades the higher rated you are, as it will give more incentive to try for higher ratings. PvP gear should be easy to get, but there still should be rewards for being good. Things like Glad titles and glad mounts are the perfect things to offer. They do not give a cosmetic upgrade, and are really coveted rewards that make people shoot for them.</div></div><hr />

PvP should be about the actual battles vs. other players. Not the different kind of things you can get, that being the main factor is stupid. PvP should have always been a side game. Something you do purely out of enjoyment, and some cosmetic rewards in there for those extra dedicated. PvE has a gear progression system because it makes sense and is a different game altogether.</div></div><hr />

Also, ahahahahahahahahaha at all the elitis crying that they wont stomp ppl just because they have better gear, now they actually may have to use a bit of skill hahahaha. Like the guy above me for example XD<br />

<br />
The thing is, all the time since the introduction of Elite gear, there was this '2.2k' thing going on. 'Need 2.2k to join, need 2.2k this, 2.2k that' as the Great Barrier between skilled PvPers and unskilled PvPers. Players who did PvP fulltime but aren't in for competitive arena to the point where you reach high ranking, didn't get anything for their commitment to the Pvp side of WoW. I myself am not a fan of arena nor will I ever be. And I end up being stuck on CP.<br />
<br />
Now they solved this problem, by rewarding those people with the ability to get by gear much easier, and while pushing them to keep PvPing for the reward it brings: Elite gear, and at the same time you can keep spending those Conquest Points for the majority of the season.<br />
<br />
Overall, this is a good strategy. It means I can do BGs the entire season and still be rewarded like the good old days when you just played PvP for the sake of PvP and ultimately got a nice set of gear out of it. The only ones that are going to be hurt by this is those special snowflakes who go 2.2k for the gear and sit there for the rest of the season. That doesn't make you a PvPer, it makes you somebody who wants to be some special f'in guy who wants to be noticed.</div></div><hr />

I dont care if noobs can get t2. But it is kinda lame that there is nothing cosmetic for those 2200, 2400+ whatever players. Nothing extra to spend points on. There is no damage advantage in looking different, its just cool. Whats the problem in letting that stay? Absolutely retarded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Point is if the player is terrible you'll still beat them... or is it the fact that the gear advantage you get from being &quot;pro&quot; and pvp focused is removed so if they ARE skilled they'll be able to beat you as your advantage is removed?<br />
Point is there's been a loooong time of pvpers above a certain rating using that rating as a &quot;I'm awesome, your shit&quot; now if you have a high rating you've continued to work for it and are skilled not just no-life pvp'd at the start of the season and creamed perfect gear to keep you there.<br />
<br />
It's not perfect but it's a hell of a lot better than the previous setup. If PVP is about skill rather than &quot;learning to beat a computer&quot; then surely having folks get an equal shot at gear if worked for is going to better the nature of PVP not diminish it?</div></div><hr />

You are wrong and i'm not stuck in the 1500 bracket. So quit complaining. :3 <br />
This is a huge step towards equaling gear, preventing win trading and helping people catch up that join mid-season. <br />

If the ladders stay competitive right till the end then those folks still have to win fights to get their conquest points against increasingly harder teams as their own MMR goes up from winning. They don't just turn up and win them without effort. There's a possibility to game the MMR still by going nuts till MMR is high and teams are hard then deliberately tanking ones rating but a simple &quot;MMR is easy to gain and hard to loose&quot; system will make sure that it's overly painful to do.<br />

If they are so terrible, how is them having the same gear as you going to effect you? I mean if you are so much more skilled and plain better than them and gear is equal, wouldn't you win?! <br />

There isn't much of a problem. Right now there's the Gladiator mount and title and then the other end of the season titles. For starters, I think they should remove Challenger, Rival, and Duelist from end of the season rewards, make them earned when you achieved a certain rating in arena and make them permanent. Then, I would reintroduce some nice cosmetic tabards that can be obtained at 2300 or 2400 rating. I also think they should re-add The Flawless Victor title into the game. <br />
<br />
That should solve it. Or at least make it more competitive for higher rated players.<br />
<br />
But honestly though, if you need so many rewards just to want to play arena, what does that say about arena itself? It's not very fun. That's what it's telling me.</div></div><hr />

Nah, a lot about this game is the prestige and &quot;power&quot; of ones character. To make PVP interesting it needs the gear to be a LITTLE more available (I still stand by my earlier post that people still have to win to get their points for the week). There DOES need to be something that makes those that are at the top of their respective ladder look special. The prestige side of it doesn't effect the game at all and gives something to work at beyond gearing the character up. Tabards are a bit.... meh. Titles, sure, nice but most folks are into the whole idea of cool looking armour sets that make their character look awesome. Keep a cosmetic tier for high ranked folks.</div></div><hr />

You will get titles, mount, and Elite gear. The incentive are there, this just means people wont sit at 2200 anymore and roflstomp ppl :)</div></div><hr />

If they give elite gear to everyone, you can still wear it. If you still have an issue with that, it's not about looking nice anymore. It's an ego issue. Which is something that I will never support. You need something other than your skill to constantly validate to yourself that you are better than most people. That is absurd and comical to me. Let rating and your own skills decide how good you are. Not how you look. <br />
<br />
This is also going to encourage more carries and paid boosts which are toxic to the game. I can't support that either. Not only that but it breeds and fosters elitism, another terrible aspect that the PvP community tends to adopt. <br />
<br />
If you really, so desperately want to make folks know you are good at the game, get the Gladiator or rank 1 title. Otherwise, most people should be content with smashing their opponent to prove that they are superior.<br />
<br />
That's my stance. Love it, hate it.</div></div><hr />

You would think they would love it as this is a great step towards better competition and a better ladder. Gladiator title will tremendously increase in prestige. <br />
<br />
To be honest competitive PvP, Arena or RBGs, should scale gear and have very rare transmog sets as rewards for winning (kind of like CMs in PvE). This will truly make &quot;current competitive PvP&quot; mostly skill dependent as you still have to take into consideration balancing issues. Normal BGs should be left for a casual PvP experience where you can feel overpowered if you so desire.</div></div><hr />

In PvE it makes no sense to casualize gear. In PvP the only reason you wouldn't want it casualized is to stroke your ego, which is absolutely irrelevant to good game design. PvP should be as accessible as it can be, and let skill factor settle the rest. That's really all there is to it.<br />
<br />
I've been nearly 2700 and achieved Glad 2 times and I fully support giving every player the same gear I have ever had. And you know why? Because I can still trounce them with my skill any day, but their enjoyment in PvP will skyrocket, and that can only be a good thing.<br />

You play arena for pvp and improving yourself and your team. If you find that boring then go pve or something. Theres a reason games like SC2 and Dota 2 are so popular, they offer competitive, fun, challenging pvp and theres no rewards to it, people just play cus its damn fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Easier catch-up<br />
2. Prevent people from 2200ing the first few weeks, and then playing minimally until the end of the season<br />
<br />
The 2200 thing never made sense, it was just a huge jump that then gave you a big advantage.<br />
<br />
Sounds about right, and honestly the changes make sense in that regard. <br />
<br />
This'll also do something to discourage people buying their 2200 rating.</div></div><hr />

What do you think makes Sc2 one of the most respected / competitive games out there? People who have some kind of gear or level advantage? No, its that it takes a lot of skill to be one of the best.<br />

The only people who actually are getting flustered over this are the 2200-2300 tryhards that are consistently around this rating. The really good players don't even care, just go to AJ and see posts from Venruki, Talbadar, Nadaghast to name a few. They don't care. And neither should Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Why? Because bringing that incentive in will make a lot more people, current or new, try PvP again. And losing out the few that actually rage enough to quit because their shinies aren't unique anymore is more than compensated by the aforementioned boost.</div></div><hr />

You'll have honor gear<br />
conquest gear<br />
elite conquest gear<br />
<br />
and in 5.3, you can upgrade all of it. Nothing changed, people that started late just get more conquest and you no longer need a rating for elite gear, which doesn't really matter since wintraders/pros will get it weeks/months before any other player gets it.<br />

Why should they waste development time making an entire new set for each class each season, just so they can feel special and unique? They did it once for the entire expansion in regards to Challenge Modes. And that can be achieved by anyone, including PvPers. <br />
<br />
The best you guys can hope for is some new tabards and the titles under Gladaitor made permanent and awarded in-season. Anything more is unreasonable and wasting development time. Stop worrying so much how you look and how others perceive you and just kill people. So sad.</div></div><hr />

Wellwell. The problem is that pve players get unique looks, new achievements etc for every raidtier. Pvpers have the one set and every1 will look the same. Imo it would be good idea to add some new achievements, transmogear (does not need new model maybe recolor?), tabards, minipets or something for high arena/rbg rates. Just to motivate casual pvpers to learn and push for higher ratings instead of farming the 10 games per week. Ofc there are players like me who plays arena becouse its fun instead of loots but imo those things would increase the amount of people queing to arena.</div></div><hr />

Who actually cares about the 2200 gear when people buy sales, get it in (exploited) rbgs, transmog exists or for people using model editing programs like evermorph in the past/now tmorph.<br />
<br />
Still disappointing that people have to wait till 5.2 for warrior nerfs instead of it just coming with 5.1. Even with how bad cataclysm was at least 4.1 nerfed how dumb warriors were in s9.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What are you worried about? If they're 'terrible', then you won't have a problem beating them in equal gear now, will you? Or are you actually terrible, and rely on a falsified 'skill' crutch known currently as a gear gap to beat people? <br />
<br />
Anyone who disagrees with these changes is a scrub. More equal playing field = more competition = better PVP environment. Anyone who argues against this just shows that they do, in fact, rely on gear over skill.</div></div><hr />

The problem is that pve players get unique looks, new achievements etc for every raidtier. Pvpers have the one set and every1 will look the same. Imo it would be good idea to add some new achievements, transmogear (does not need new model maybe recolor?), tabards, minipets or something for high arena/rbg rates. Just to motivate casual pvpers to learn and push for higher ratings instead of farming the 10 games per week. Ofc there are players like me who plays arena becouse its fun instead of loots but imo those things would increase the amount of people queing to arena.<br />
<br />
Do you even realize how small of a percentage arena holds over the overall PvP playerbase? It's a mini side game. That's all it is. You're asking for comparable rewards to PvE for this shoebox PvP minigame. No. <br />
<br />
You don't deserve anything other than some minor cosmetic awards. Not only does a small percentage play arena, a significantly smaller percentage of that total plays well enough to garner these &quot;2200&quot; rewards. It's a complete waste of development. They're finally smartening up and opening up the PvP gear to the entire PvP playerbase. <br />
<br />
Really though, what's all the fuss about adding all of these rewards for being -mediocre-? You're 2200, you aren't suddenly good at the game. That's what's reserved for Gladiator, and they get their due rewards. You want to look/feel special? Achieve Gladiator.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you got the point. I don't care about gear or being special snowflake. I just hoped those cosmetics would increase the interrest of pve / casual players to actually play rated pvp ---&gt; increase the amount of people playing pvp ---&gt; shorter ques, more teams and different setups. And like i said before only minor cosmetics / minipets should be added as rewards. No gear advantage..</div></div><hr />

Most of the people complaining about the 2200 elite gear being given to everyone are some of the most toxic players I've ever encountered in the game. WoW would wholly benefit from their departure. Hopefully Blizzard realizes that. The PvP community has become rife with elitism and boosting, it's sickening.</div></div><hr />

Gear Changes<br />
To accomplish the goals of making PvP more accessible and less punishing, gearing more consistent and flexible, and flattening the power curve out over the course of a season, there are some significant changes in the works:<br />
2200 rating requirements removed from all PvP gear. (5.2)<br />
Gear will be available in four tiers:<br />
Dreadful Gladiator’s gear will be crafted. (5.2)<br />
Malevolent Gladiator’s gear, including weapons, will be purchased with Honor Points. (5.2)<br />
New tier of PvP items: Tyrannical Gladiator’s gear will be purchased with Conquest Points. (5.2)<br />
Tyrannical Gladiator’s gear can be purchased for Honor after 27000 Conquest Points are earned for the season. (5.3)<br />
Elite Tyrannical Gladiator’s gear can only be purchased with Conquest Points after 27,000 Conquest Points have been earned for the season. (5.2)<br />
what ?? ow this is the finish of the game . i will better play some WoT or Dota , for free but wouldnt pay for this shit . Cause i am responsive player 2x gladiator and should..... <br />
The make free rbg (evereyone can take 2.2 on rbg for 1 hour) and ow they will give epics for free ? no hardcore ?<br />
this game totaly die after Ulduar, there no borders between guys who farm LFR and guys who kill Sha. just will abort my account GL HF Blizzard (and big ThX cause i can stop play ) =))</div></div><hr />

I think wow pvp community is much better without people like you. If you want to be hardcore you get your glad. This change only takes the gearcap away and lets ppl to compete even on their alts. <br />
And i think you should stay out of dota too becouse you wont get gear advantage in it based of ratings/ time played.</div></div><hr />

Quit the hate and think a sec before posting shit like this. <br />
If you are mediocore 1900+ player after full gear there is absolutely nothing to achieve in arena if you are not good enough for gladiator. That will result to huge drop in playerbase of arena pvp. Thats why i want some minor cosmetics /pets added. So players can achieve something while playing and getting better at the game. Cba to wait 20 minutes in ques after everyone will quit when they are fully geared.<br />
<br />

Sums it up pretty well. This just helps to remove the artificial barrier that was imposed years back. Why would people who can reach high ratings 'need' better gear? Cosmetic rewards make more sense.<br />

A rating requirement for gear has always been a stupid idea. The fact that's someone's skilled should give them the edge in PvP, but giving someone a statistical boost as a reward for that skill is unnecessary doubling-up that makes the gap far too wide. It's not PvE; in PvP, someone is on the receiving end of your gear.<br />
<br />
One thing, though. Unless I'm reading this wrong, you can't spend any conquest points until you have 27000 of them, because the tier bought with conquest requires 27000 points earned in the season. Am I wrong about that?</div></div><hr />

Yes some like me pvp for fun. But why would new arenaplayer ever try getting good in arena and push for rates? He can just play 10 games per week and still get all the benefits of arena. It doesnt encourage to try getting better.<br />

You are wrong about that.<br />
You will buy &quot;Tyrannical Gladiator’s gear&quot; with conquest points till you reach the 27000 earned conquest-points-mark, from there on the &quot;Tyrannical Gladiator’s gear&quot; will cost you Honor and you will invest your conquest points in &quot;Elite Tyrannical Gladiator’s gear&quot;.<br />

<br />
The so called pro pvpers in wow are not better, or more skillful in the current system, they are just first to get the gear and rating, which is a factor more of time played than actual skill. Any real pvper wants a true skill based contest, not an epeen gear check.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Small side note, it may not work out, but something like getting a very small conquest reward for every win AFTER cap would be a good idea? like 3 min 15 max depending on rating? It would, if not for people playing all day and all night (which, with so small rewards, should perhaps be okay for them to get ahead for?) at least make the PvP scene a whole lot more active? I don't know, I would like the idea. 10 gold + 5 conq points per win *after cap, edit* would be awesome actually! :D</div></div><hr />

I have to call this a lie. Most of the people at high rates are actually good. Arrogant and rude. Yes. But not bad. Minority are exploiters.(except rbg ladders which are still fucked up by mmr bug abusers. Would be cool if blizz fixed this)<br />
Low rated people easily blame gear or their class for being bad. Usually the problem is between chair and keyboard. Or why would i face full malevo geared ppl at 1300 ratibg when im farming points on my freshly dinged alt?<br />
Gear change is great but i doubt it helps bad players getting any higher rates.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't bode too well for hardcore PVE'ers with a lack of time - but I guess the arguement there is we choose to PVE main time, allowing less time for PVP.

And i think you should stay out of dota too becouse you wont get gear advantage in it based of ratings/ time played.<br />
<br />
You go girl xD.<br />
Now honestly guys, you're not seeing the big picture anyway. The &quot;pros&quot; will have an advantage anyway cause think of it: if you go for high rating in the first week your cap will increase for the second week and you'll get the weaps alot faster than everybody else anyway. So i don't see why all the qq... plus skill&gt;gear ? hello? if you're that &quot;pro&quot; you can beat a full tyran in greens so just drop it.</div></div><hr />

-players can only buy 476 gear(down from 483, already acquired gear remains unchanged) with honor and it can not be upgraded(npc is gone). players that farmed this season will have 483+upgrade= 491 gear, im not even talking about t2 upgraded weapons. have fun beating guys with +15 ilvls<br />
<br />
on the upside every noob can get full elite gear(something that only gives a cosmetical benefit for the best players) with just capping 1800 points for 15 weeks *sigh*<br />

False. The pro tournament level players are exactly that. They have to qualify on the Arena Tournament Realm where everyone uses the same gear.</div></div><hr />

I play pvp only around 3 hours each day. But since i play Fury pvp max rating i can get is like 1900.<br />
So even tho i play quite allot and i like pvp i could not get elite gear without getting boosted by some imba guy.<br />
And i do know i wont get any better im doing pvp since S1.....#<br />
<br />
Another gr8 thing is that i will be able to grind honor for my FC gear once i get to 27k conquests. Atm im upgrading items that i use for FC and for Fury.<br />
But 5 items in FC gear are blue cant afford conquests to buy epic replacement.<br />
With that change you can have off spec gear for honor :D</div></div><hr />

This, hence the comments about GW2. Quite a few peeps on here are complaining that &quot;noobs&quot; get the best gear - well pvp is about skill, it's about playing your class better than other people. How can you possibly do that with _any_ kind of gear differential, it will _always_ have an impact. Thus gear _will_ diminish your ability to say &quot;I'm a good pvper!&quot;. All pvp gear should be the same - do as GW2, you enter an rbg or arena your gearset changes. The ladder system will, win trading/botting aside better reflect actual skill. Add transmog sets at different points in the ladder and tada you have a skill based solution with appropriate rewards.</div></div><hr />

Top PvP players still have the gear advantage since they get higher caps, which is fine since this is not a FPS and gear does matter, but now people that start late, or alts, can somewhat catch up, which was impossible before.

Many of my good friends haven't earned recognition because they lacked a simple -boostable- achievement and dropped PvP.<br />
I continued to remain casual and started to pug RBGs because of the conq cap.<br />
Now with 2200 wall removed and extra tiers it will be more equal ground.<br />
<br />
Only bad side of this change will be it can encourage more botters for honor farm and more dull BGs.<br />
But now we also have that too, so I guess and hope at least there'll be more true PvPers to outnumber the botters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let those people do it I guess. They will be the ones having the disadvantage early on but on long terms they have the advantage when they can buy full elite. But I wouldn't call it much of a win-win since iirc elite gear isn't too much of a huge upgrade in stats.</div></div><hr />

Not the different kind of things you can get, that being the main factor is stupid. PvP should have always been a side game. Something you do purely out of enjoyment, and some cosmetic rewards in there for those extra dedicated. PvE has a gear progression system because it makes sense and is a different game altogether.<br />
<br />
''something you do purely out of enjoyment, and some cosmetic rewards in there for those extra dedicated'' Well that statement wasnt really that smart, since that's exactly what they are removing now, the small rewards for the extra dedicated. Except the titles from the end of the season, there will be NOTHING at all to fight for during the season. Everyone will be doing RBG's now because the cap is so insanly much higher in RBGs than it is in arenas. Since S1 there has always been goals to reach. In tbc and wotlk it was really exciting going through the ratings as you got a piece at like 1500, and then the next goal was 1600 where you got the next piece. There was always goals to reach because there was always an award at the specific rating, and the excitement of reaching those goals is one part of what made arena even more fun. in cata they removed most of those mile-stones, but now most of the mid-bracket players was fighting for the sweet ''elite'' gear. What are we going to fight for during s13? absolutely nothing... Sure arena is fun, but i think most of the people here agrees with we when i say that having a goal, or getting an award for your work, sure as hell gives more motivation to do something and getting better at it, than ''just for the fun of it''. Anyways, where i want to come with this, is that like someone else said, you still need to have some awards for the better people mid-season, for example some sweet cosmetic changes, and not just titles in the end. Lets compare it to the FIS Alpine Ski World Cup, every single race during the cup there is a winner, imagine the feeling they get when they recieve that 3.5 kg crystal globe for first place, or the smaller ones for 2:nd and 3:rd place. That's you when you get your fancy looking elite gear cus you're better than others and actually receive something for your work during the season. And then, in the end of the cup, there's ofc a bigger reward, the big 9 kilogram crystal globe for the winner, thats you in wow aswell, but instead you get a title and maybe a mount if you did really well.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard removed pvp goal, and now pvp is about farming conquest points during 6 months. I agree that elite weapons were a bad reward that created a wall, but every raid below 2200 rating wished to arrive at 2200 rating, even if it was impossible for them. Without any goal there's no reason to go. Even the uninteresting challenge modes has some kind of reward to go for.<br />

I can't be the first, I'm realistic, but I can complete the content, I'm optimistic. To reach the end is always my purpose. But now, PvP has no end, it's a pointless neverending race that we can't win.<br />

The 2200 goal was good, the elite weapon reward was bad. Just replace the reward for another one, a good one.<br />

But isnt that what it has always been? farm for honor gear, then for conquest gear, and then for rating. For myself I feel this change will be great, allowing players like myself to reach high in arenas. I play 5 different characters, had 7 I played in cata. Now I dont have to wurry about being behind on gear farm, and can focus on rating. Being stuck on 1900 mmr on 3-4 chars cus I'm so far behind on gear and always meeting full t2 warriors, mages, hunters or locks which recks us. <br />
<br />
A goal doesnt have to be a chase for a reward such as the 2.2k weapon. My goal has been to reach high arena rating, to be better than most others with several classes no matter what virtual reward i get. I cant play 1 character on days end without having a go at my other characters, I like variety. And now with these changes I see myself playing competivately on my alts aswell, running certain setups with the guys I find fun playing with.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. The 2200+ should have either recolor or a 'hardmode' like cosmetic only set.<br />
I myself would never get to even pretend to get close to them...but I think there should be some kind of reward for the people that do<br />

But isnt that what it has always been? farm for honor gear, then for conquest gear, and then for rating. For myself I feel this change will be great, allowing players like myself to reach high in arenas. I play 5 different characters, had 7 I played in cata. Now I dont have to wurry about being behind on gear farm, and can focus on rating. Being stuck on 1900 mmr on 3-4 chars cus I'm so far behind on gear and always meeting full t2 warriors, mages, hunters or locks which recks us. <br />
<br />
A goal doesnt have to be a chase for a reward such as the 2.2k weapon. My goal has been to reach high arena rating, to be better than most others with several classes no matter what virtual reward i get. I cant play 1 character on days end without having a go at my other characters, I like variety. And now with these changes I see myself playing competivately on my alts aswell, running certain setups with the guys I find fun playing with.<br />
<br />
The danger with this system is that it will only turn into grinding - leading to more danger of afkers and bots. When a game considers the only thing needed to get gear is to push 1 button to Q up... and get gear - then something has failed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're removing rating requirements on gear, not the ratings themselves, so you still compete to beat out others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How many guilds try to get the first world kill? Less than 1%<br />
How many players at the beggining of expansion try to be first lvl max? Less than 1%<br />
<br />
Players are realistic and prefer human goals. 2200 rating was a challenging goal with a good reward feeling for an important amount of players. The highest rating is something that only a minimal amount of players care about.<br />
<br />
Why atempt to raise the rating? If Blizzard don't make me feel unhappy with rewards at higher rating than mine, I'm happy where I am. In other words, PvP will be farming. Each week cap your conquest points and that's all. No goals and at the end, boring as doing daylis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1.) The people actually complaining about are very few in number, there's really nothing to worry about from them crying endlessly.<br />
2.) Giving elite gear to everyone encourages more people in general to participate.You remove the carrot on a stick from mediocre players and give a carrot on a stick to nearly every PvP player. This = success. <br />
3.) From a business standpoint, it's a sound idea. More people like I said will be intrigued and subs will increase because of it. Also, having more options to choose from color variations will help reduce boredom and increase variety. <br />
4.) 2200 players aren't really good. They are mediocre. If anything put a cosmetic tabard and give it to 2400, 2500, and 2600 players. Those players truly deserve it. 2200 is honestly nothing impressive, from the view of a player who's been much higher in the past. <br />
5.) It helps kill the boosting/carry business. People will no longer have an incentive to buy T2 weapons OR special snowflake gear anymore, this can only be good for the community. It will help increase competition and people looking to get the 2200 ratings simply to prove they are good, not to chase some carrot on a stick. <br />
6.) It will help remove the toxic tryhards who can only brag about their snowflake gear and are too bad to get any other cosmetic reward. It will reduce elitism and general hostility that's prevalent in the PVP community today. The top, top players I've actually talked to or read a post from DO NOT CARE about this. They simply do not, because the challenge is all that's needed for them and they do not need to feel special, because they realize it's absolutely pathetic. <br />
<br />
All in all, it's an excellent change and one I have no doubt Blizzard considered and planned through. This change can ONLY be good for the PvP community as a whole. If you do not support this, frankly, you are being a selfish brat and only caring about stroking your ego instead of realizing the big picture.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CodeConqueror</div><div class="date">2013-01-18, 07:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with the removal of the rating requirement for Elite gear is that now the only reward is the rating itself which doesn't do anything for you in game and there will be a drop off of people playing/people playing less because there's nothing for them to work for and get out of it. There needs to be some type of in game reward for hitting 2.2k, possible rewards:<br />
<br />
Title that is only available while at that rating (similar to the one from BWD achieve)<br />
Special mount that is only usable while at that rating (must be usable in non-flying areas; similar to the way the halloween broom mount works)<br />
Transmog set that looks different from current PVP/PVE tier gear (not just a recolor; similar to challenge mode rewards or even use the same rewards)<br />
<br />
<br />
But I agree that it shouldn't be a stat booster that gives you an advantage over others. The only advantage you should have that matters is skill.<br />

The rest of the changes look like really good improvements for everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Not true. I've seen tons of them here and on the official post. Whether any change is good or bad, there will almost always be a vocal group endlessly crying about it.<br />
2) By this measure, there's no reason to do anything in game that requires skill to earn. Extend this logic to PVE and you should also give all players who participate in normal raiding a way to earn heroic tier gear without having to down heroic bosses. Granted PVE and PVP shouldn't be treated the same, but the logic remains.<br />
3) There's no way to know for sure how/if it will impact subscription numbers but it will most likely increase them due to frustrated players that gave up might come back and try again. But, how many players will walk away due to nothing to aim for when reaching high ratings? Who knows, maybe none.<br />
4) Sounds like BS but w/e. If 2.2k isn't anything special, then they should adjust the rating requirement to reflect what minimum rating a skilled player should be able to attain. I think 2.2k still demonstrates enough skill to merit a reward (yes, some people will get carried but there's no way to fully eliminate that); it doesn't make you the most skilled, but skilled enough IMHO.<br />
5) This is already addressed by #2.<br />
6) You exemplify the exact elitism and toxic hostility in the selfishly bratty way you claim to be against (your final statement reflects this as well). You sound like a bitter player who hasn't been able to reach 2.2k this season or last and just want a way to feel better about it. But, what do I know, I don't know you, just your words.</div></div><hr />

Why do you think you are elite at 2200? You are anything but elite. You are still miles behind the really good players that can achieve Gladiator and beyond. Blizzard is just removing the carrot on a stick from mediocre players and placing it in front of nearly everyone, boosting PvP popularity. It's a good change that you are too blinded by your ego to see. <br />
<br />
People say they have nothing to work for anymore, then why do so many of these &quot;elite&quot; players still play tons of games after attaining their gear set? Certainly not because the incentive is now removed once you have it. Sorry, but none of you make sense. At. All. <br />

PvP should be all about skill and gear advantages should have nothing to do with it. If you play an FPS game like CS or Halo, everyone has access to the same equipment and the only thing that matters is how well you use it. Other games like CoD where you can earn new weapons, its mostly just a skin and the basic weapons are just as good.<br />
<br />
All characters should be normalized with the same stats whenever you enter a PvP instance.</div></div><hr />

I never said you're elite because you're at 2200, you're just better than others obviously, but mostly i was just talking about the elite gear itself, the extra reward at higher rating. I wouldnt care if it was just called ''tier 2'' or simply called nothing but just another color, but there still has to be some kind of reward, because that makes it so much more fun. I think most people, even you, agree's with me when i say that everything is more fun when you get something cool out of it. Sure now you might say, but hey, you get a title in the end of the season if you're good, but that's in the end of the season, what about the rest of the season? At the moment i play my main to very high rating, then i usually dont do that much arena on that char, but then i instead do alot of arenas on all of my alts to reach higher goals, which one atm is 2200 where i get some sort of reward for my work. I LOVED the system they had in tbc and wrath, where you got your parts the higher rated you were, because then there was not just the 2200 goal, but actually alot of goals and mile-stones you could reach, which made it really fun. But that's just me, i love having a goal and getting a reward for reaching it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lol ok, really?<br />
<br />
like blizzard (any company really) doesnt take the good ideas from other games and implement them in their own product?<br />
<br />
you are welcome to your opinion but i strongly disagree with it. the pvp gear system is quite good and something that i think should be in just about every mmo. in a pvp setting everyone, i believe, should be given the same gear. it should be about skill &gt; gear. in the past i was a firm believer that the entry level blue honor gear should have been puchased for a small amount of gold similar to the way swtor did. when gw2 came out i thought that that was the better approach. <br />
<br />
pvp is about killing the other player, plain and simple so while i believe skill determines your ability to do this its not the case 100% of the time. someone who just hit 90 in greens will get absolutely stomped by people who are in full pvp gear. there is really no competitiveness/challenge that person can put up until they obtain better gear so whats the point in forcing them to grind?<br />
<br />
now, if they can just finally change the way all spells/abilities work they might actually get some sort of resemblence of balance in the game</div></div><hr />

(never a R1 though) I more than welcome this change. I have quiet a few friends in the game who are currently 2200-2300 rated with T2. When the TR realm came out in S11 alot of these players had 2200+ teams. For some strange reason I can say about 75% of them never made it past 1900 on the TR. With a level playing field their &quot;true&quot; skill came out. Granted there were other factors, later patch w/ last seasons gear but still, there is no excuse for a 2300 player to not make it into the 2,000's. It just opened my eyes on how HUGE of a gap T2 weapons made. I always knew you had an advantage but to the extent my fellow 2200+ players wern't able to make it 2k+. I am happy that the 2200 bar is gone. I welcome all the compatition in world. PvP will reward those who are &quot;skilled&quot; by allowing them to achieve their gear faster and climb up the ranks quicker. I those players choosenot to play they will fall behind in the gear race and potentially lose that top spot. If they come back after sitting for 2 months they may not have the gear to compete anymore until they continue to play and prove that they deserved the top spot! It's excellent. I don't see how people think this is a bad idea, Wintraders and Boosters have plauged the PvP community. Your 2200+ Achieve has become like Warth's PvE iLvL.</div></div><hr />

There are other possible rewards besides gear, additional glyphs, items like the ones droped by rares, cinematics, multi player mounts, the skybreaker. Something more cool than a tabard, and something less unbalancing than gear.</div></div><hr />

I took a massive break and started MOP almost 4 months late and decided to level healers to play with friends and solely due to the gear and slight lack of practice i've literally not broken 2100 so far this season but im still rocking alot of blues.<br />
<br />
That right there is why they needed to change the current system, its disgusting that 2500 players cant get on alts, farm full upgraded honor gear and not get decent rating with a t1 comp and any1 who disagrees needs to open their eyes and realize that you shouldn't get an unfair advantage simply because you decide to log on and play 1 character from the day of the season starting until it ends.<br />

-the fact that u still need to earn the points to get the weapons, even if u get a 10k cap mid season u still have to win, so better players or players learning a new class/spec will be rewarded the same as if they started early.<br />
- personally, and i think itl be the same for others, but i made my druid resto and my shaman resto for this xpac and due to RL commitments i don't have time to gear them in dps to mess around in bgs or dailies or try a diff comp or rbg. I am really looking forward to doing 3s as resto on them and then grabbing a full set of moonkin or ele gear and messing around on live from just honor once ive reached the 27k cap.<br />
- THIS is probably the biggest thing. alot of my good arena partners have quit, while leveling a shamna and gearing ive met alot of really nice but horrific pvpers and may or may not be good with ur class in arena, now i still do 2s wtih them but 2s is broken and because i started late i need to get as high as possible in rbg or arena for gear to even stand a chance. Having this system will allow u to inadvertently help ur friends get better in arena because in time they will have full elite gear whether u did 3s or rbgs with them or not, and ull have off specs that may suite a comp. It is extremely hard to help some1 learn arena atm when they are half blues, ur half blues and u do 2s and 2 t2 mages come out of invis and kill him in a blanket silence.<br />

i know its a wall of text, but tbh there is no downside, if i was stil playing at 2500 rating like wotlk/cata and i had full t2 id rather do it knowing we beat them just coz of comp/skill not coz i logged on since release of season. people need to relax and realise that messing around with cool people and teaching them to even go up 100 rating from 1500 is just as fun sometimes as being on front page of the ladder</div></div><hr />

I think it removes a huge incentive to PVP, or rather, it diminishes the incentive to want to play better or to push yourselves.<br />
<br />
It's no longer a reward for high level game play but a reward for time spent on the game.<br />
It's like daily rewards where there's no skill involved, you just do them for a long time and you get rewards for showing up.<br />
<br />
If they're talking about advantages and disadvantages then they should probably spend more time balancing the damn game.<br />
Right now it's a joke how easy some classes/specs have it in PVP and it's the biggest turn off.<br />
The most infuriating disadvantage has nothing to do with &quot;gear&quot; but all to do with &quot;class balance.&quot;</div></div><hr />
