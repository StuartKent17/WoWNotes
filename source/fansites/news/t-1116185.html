Druid Symbiosis Spells<br />
Druids get a fun new ability (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/110309) in Mists of Pandaria that gives them a spell from another class and the target an ability from the druid. With the help (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1103278-MoP-Symbiosis) of some of our nice forum users, Sunfyre compiled a list (http://www.owlkin.org/2012/03/23/symbiosis-results/) of all of the ability swaps that take place. <br />
<br />
These abilities are changing every patch, so consider them a preview and not the final list of spells.<br />

World Boss Raid - Galleon<br />
Galleon is one of the new World Bosses in Mists of Pandaria, located in the Valley of the Four Winds. He currently spawns a few times a day on the beta servers, and our wonderful livestreamers (http://www.twitch.tv/mmo_champion) made an attempt (http://www.twitch.tv/mmo_champion/b/314820301) (2:07:48) to defeat him with 80 players that was unsuccessful (down to ~65%).<br />
<br />
This time around they are going to make another attempt with more players on Sunday April 15th at 22:00 CET / 4:00 PM EST. This will take place on the Mekkatorque-EU beta realm. The spawn timing isn't known exactly right now, so if you want to take part, be ready to spend some time waiting. For more details speak with Niklive (Alliance) or Longview (Horde) in game. <br />
<br />
There are multiple mobs involved in the encounter, with Galleon and Chief Salyis being the main two. Galleon has 261 Million health and Chief Salyis has 11 million health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fire Shot (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121673-fire-shot) - Saurok Skirmishers riding on Galleon's back fire flaming crossbow bolts at random players, inflicting 15,000 Fire damage.<br />
Stomp (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121787-stomp) - Galleon stomps the ground, inflicting 92,500 to 107,500 Physical damage to players within 70 yards and knocking them down for 3 sec.<br />
Cannon Barrage (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121600-cannon-barrage) - Chief Salyis orders his minions to fire off eight powerful cannon blasts. Each blast inflicts 300,000 Fire damage to players within 10 yards and knocks them back.<br />
Salyin Warmonger - Chief Salyis' Warmongers periodically jump down from Galleon's back to engage players.<br />
Impaling Pull (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/121747-impaling-pull) - Pulls a distant target towards the Warmonger and inflicts 13,875 to 16,125 Physical damage.<br />

Changing Talents and Specializations<br />
Either in the next beta build or the one after that, you will be able to speak to your appropriate class trainer and they can unspec, unglyph or untalent you for a small fee. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220751-all-classes-talents-and-specializations/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4427705594?page=1#2))<br />
<br />
New Spellbook Feedback<br />
To clarify, the new spellbook has 4 tabs (5 if you have a pet or are a druid).<br />
<br />
The first tab is general, and contains riding, armor skills, languages and guild perks.<br />
The second tab is your current spec tab. It contains all of the spells -- class and spec, active and passive -- that apply to your character.<br />
<br />
The other 2-3 tabs are for other specs. They contain all of the spells (class and spec) that those specs can use. If you want to know if e.g. both Holy and Shadow have Power Word: Shield, you can look on those tabs.<br />
<br />
We are currently still sorting spells within a tab by active and then passive, but we may merge them back together if the active vs. passive thing proves confusing.<br />
<br />
This design is different from the spellbook on live, which classified every spell as belonging to a spec. This made some sense for say mages, whose spells tend to all have fire, frost or arcane theming, but didn't work well for many other classes. Sinister Strike is on the Combat tab, but Eviscerate is on the Assassination tab. Garrote is Assassination, but Sap is Subtlety. Super intuitive, huh?<br />
<br />
We understand that putting lots of spells on one tab is overwhelming, but arbitrarily dividing spells onto multiple pages is confusing. There's no clear win either way. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/220731-feedback-new-spell-book/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4427565540?page=1#5))<br />
<br />
Demonology Direction<br />
<br />
You aren’t intended to be a melee caster in Meta. Things like Demonic Leap, Carrion Swarm and Immolation Aura are more situational and fun toys than core rotational spells you need on a challenging raid boss. We did experiment with Demo spending more time in melee earlier on, but we have backed off of that for some of the reasons you guys mention.<br />
The basic rotation is something like: Keep Corruption up. Use Hand of Gul’dan on cooldown. Respond to Molten Core procs with Soul Fire. Use Shadowbolt when there is nothing else to do. Fel Flame is for movement. Breath of Gul’dan is for melee.<br />
During Meta, all of your rotational spells should cost Fury. You shouldn’t have to pay nearly any attention to mana. <br />
The basic mechanic of Demonic Fury is to build to 1000, go into Metamorphosis, and then pop out again when you reach 500. If you need that extra dps *right now*, you stay in Metamorphosis until you run out. <br />
There’s a bug right now where when you exit Metamorphosis, it drains half of your remaining Fury. It’s the same bug causing the DK spell conversion to drain all of your runic power.Use Demonic Slash and use Soul Fire when you get a Molten Core proc. The Molten Core procs will come from Wild Imps.<br />
<br />
Wild Imps has changed so that imps consistently proc from your Shadowbolt and Demonic Slash. The Wild Imps in turn can proc Molten Core. If you like the old Wild Imps mechanic, you can recreate it with a glyph.<br />
<br />
We are experimenting a lot with Demo, so let us know how these latest changes feel. We don't feel that the older design of Demo (use both Fire and Shadow spells with lots of demon damage) was super compelling. It is a spec that has wanted a home for some time. Affliction and Destruction by comparison have a stronger kit.

Black arrow Feedback<br />
We agree with you that the redesigned Black Arrow hasn't worked out well yet, and even overlaps a little with the new Powershot talent. We are likely to revert Black Arrow to the 4.3 design.

Free BattleTag Change<br />
When we introduced BattleTag nicknames, many of you created one to try the feature in the Diablo III beta test or simply establish your new identity in anticipation of Diablo III's release.<br />
<br />
Today, we're releasing an update that will give everyone one opportunity to change their BattleTag nickname for free. If you picked a nickname you're not happy with, don't worry -- you can pick a new one. Even if you haven't created your BattleTag identifier yet, you'll still get one free BattleTag change to use after it's been created (similar to the way character name changes for StarCraft II worked).<br />
<br />
As we announced previously, BattleTag nicknames will be required in order to play Diablo III, and in the future, they'll be used in a variety of ways across all of Battle.net. To set or change your BattleTag, simply log in to Battle.net account management, head to the Account &gt; Summary page, and look for the Create or Change option. BattleTags aren't unique, so you can pick any name you like as long as it adheres to the BattleTag Naming Policy.<br />
<br />
Here's what you can expect from BattleTags when Diablo III launches:<br />
<br />
Your BattleTag will serve as your public identity when chatting, grouping, or interacting with other players in Diablo III.<br />
Once two players agree to become BattleTag friends, you'll automatically be able to see and interact with each of the Diablo III characters your friend plays automatically – no need to add multiple character names to your friends list individually.<br />
Prior to the game's release, your presence on the Diablo III forums will be connected to your BattleTag, rather than any one specific character in the game. You'll transcend boundaries!<br />
<br />
Our long-term plans include adding the ability for BattleTag friends to participate in cross-game chat (in StarCraft II, Diablo III, and World of Warcraft, and future Blizzard Entertainment games), as well as offer other features similar to what's currently available via Real ID. More cool additions to BattleTag are on the horizon, but we're not quite ready to talk about those yet.<br />
<br />
We'll continue to keep you up to date on our plans for BattleTag nicknames as more info becomes available. For more details, check out the BattleTag FAQ (http://us.battle.net/support/en/article/battletagfaq).</div></div><hr />

Unconfirmed that they get but there is a Wrath with Symbiosis. It's believed to be for ret and is unconfirmed, may be unconfirmed.<br />
<br />
There are some nice spells there<br />
As Feral:<br />
DK; Ranged attack good for PvE and PvP<br />
Hunter; De-target/threat drop good for PvP (force enemy to detarget you interrupting a cast) and may have use for PvE<br />
Mage; PvE may have a use, PvP has more use<br />
Paladin and Priest; good for PvP, has use in PvE<br />
Rogue; good PvP and PvE<br />
Shaman; mediocred (they hit for &lt;100damage)<br />
Warlock; good PvE and no doubt PvP<br />
Warrior; good for PvE and PvP<br />
<br />
@ Yim<br />
It's for utility its not meant to be for raw damage, healing. If there are fights like beth in MoP, allows rogues to taunt mobs. If give rogues a strong survival CD as well</div></div><hr />

I find it a bit sad that the current &quot;World boss&quot; are frankly worthless (other than poseidus, but that is because of the mount).<br />

And about the druid spell: hum .... might be hard to balance: eg: a druid tank needs a dk in the raid to be able to gain another CD, but if a dk is not in the group, then I fear you would never take the druid tank ...</div></div><hr />

Yes, Dark Simulacrum is garbage unless you manage to use it right before a Paladin uses Lay on Hands or Divine Shield. You hardly gain any damage benefit, only ever found it useful on Ragnaros since you could get a single burst of 50k damage at times, otherwise these types of abilities are useless unless what you copy scales with your highest stat (strength, agility, spirit etc) for more damage or healing if it's an attack or healing spell.</div></div><hr />

:D<br />
<br />
I love that other classes get nothing yet the druid (In most cases) gets a awesome spell. Druids = best class.<br />
<br />
The real reason though is because otherwise you would be stacking druids, this way it's nice to have a druid and its something to bring one for which right now there's barely a reason to bring a druid over another class (Especially resto), but you wont wanna stack them in most cases.<br />
<br />
Mushrooms is still a great spell especially for melee but its nothing big and i think that's probably a good thing so you wont make druids op.<br />
<br />
I think right now (Not knowing what Monk gives.) i would give it in this order Shadow priest &gt; a tank &gt; shammy for pve, of course there could be a situation for other classes and its all based on your raid.</div></div><hr />

Shadow priest may win over a tank, depending on the situation a extra raid wide healing CD will be better. Remember this copy's the spell so having two tranquility's in a raid that would normally only have one could be nice. <br />

Target swapping every thirty seconds is already very powerful for Ferals. This is going to be INTENSE. Though, Soul Swap could be better for certains fights. Eitherway, effing excited. <br />

Symbiosis is a druid spell not a priest spell, of course it gives the druid something better. And in most cases that's the point.<br />
It's meant to fill holes in the druid class, and i think its a fun way of doing it. Otherwise you might as well make every class the same.<br />
<br />
Remember you keep your spell, Symbiosis only copy's the spell.</div></div><hr />

The point is to give them the advantage in all situations? I guess I shouldn't be surprised. They were Blizzard's pet class for over 4 years.<br />

Do you really think Shadow can use a channeled heal that drops Shadowform with a Cat knocking the hell of out him? Seriously? Priest gets upper hand. Cat Disperses. Cat gets upper hand. Tranquil.... Skull Bash. About as Fair and Balanced as Fox News.<br />

And you completely fail at reading. This is a beneficial spell that can ONLY be cast on someone in your group or raid. A feral druid is not going to cast it on you as it is attacking you. In the case of shadow priests, if a feral in a raid cast it on a spriest in HIS OWN raid.. then the cat would be able to use dispersion... which is nice for some raid encounters.<br />
<br />
But again, you should probably learn to read.</div></div><hr />

It looks like something you would use on a party member to gain their ability to help. <br />
<br />
for example, look at the warlock demonic portal one. It allows them to teleport to the target warlocks portal...why would they have it for the enemy? then the enemy just wouldnt cast a portal rendering the spell useless.<br />
<br />
also, it would be dumb to take a key ability from someone an enemy target and give them a decent ability in return...because you are really only giving them the ability as you are not actually &quot;taking&quot; the ability away from them. <br />

<br />
The point is it doesn't really give anything good to any of the other classes and all caster dps get a heal, it fills hole's in the druid class.<br />
For example rogues have redirect that's been a hole for kitty's for a long time, instead of just giving them it and making every class the same they gave us Symbiosis. <br />
<br />
Its not like you lose that CD you just gain a extra one, it copy's the spell.<br />
<br />
You give the druid a CD and get a spell you may use but probably wont its the same for every class.<br />
Sorry if i don't see why that's a game breaker, a little more tough sure but game breaking? no.</div></div><hr />

Posted this on the druid forums, hope i can cancel it too.<br />
<br />
How pissed off would you Druids be, if me....a hunter. Clicked off Symbiosis every time it was put on me(hoping that would cancel any spell you received from me). This spell will be the NUMBER ONE complaint about all forms of play in MOP. PVP/PVE whatever it is, the amount of Raging that will go on with this spell, will dwarf anything that has ever been seen in the 7 years or so WOW has been out. I honestly want no part of it.<br />
There is a reason that in SWTOR with the new Legacy system, that they dont allow you to use...for example Force abilities on your Bounty Hunter. The amount of balance needed for PVE/PVP is not worth the effort. So it was relegated to basically solo use on a long cooldown.<br />
You Druids with your rose tinted glasses can't see how much damage this spell will do to the game. Again, i want no part of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a raid boss designed for max level players, I doubt anyone on the beta realm is over level 86 if even that. <br />
<br />
It's like trying to kill Ragnaros with 80 level 80 people, they wont come far.<br />

The boss is &quot;tuned&quot; around 25-40 level 90 characters hitting on him.</div></div><hr />

But the amount of people who can't even read is staggering. It's a friendly spell, how can it even be otherwise, you know what the word &quot;symbiosis&quot; means, right?<br />
Same goes for calling a single buff spell &quot;unbalanced&quot;. How can a single buff be unbalanced with respect to itself is beyond my understanding.<br />
Also some shadow priests who think that tranquillity will shift them out of shadow form need to learn their class I guess. My main is a druid and I haven't played wow for a year and I still know that only holy spells shift you out of SF. Tranquillity is not a bloody holy spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How Symbiosis works:<br />
1. Must be cast on a Friendly target.<br />
2. Friendly target copies (note copies) one of the Druid's Spells. Druids get a copy... note copy of one of the friendly target's spells.<br />
3. Druid and said linker keep their original spells and again an additional spell.<br />
Hardest part is picking the druid/other roll comp, and the spell cannot be cast in combat and lasts one hour.</div></div><hr />

What fair are you even talking about. You're getting a free spell, you don't want it - don't use it. How can it remotely be unfair, I don't even.<br />

There's more to WoW than raids. I think if a healer fell in a 5 man, the mage MIGHT be able to spam Healing Touch on the tank to keep the party going, while using their level 90 talents to sustain their mana. I could see it being most practical in PvP though.</div></div><hr />

I agree, the amount of people who can spend 15 minutes complaining about something.. after not spending 2 minutes actually READING what they are complaining about.<br />
<br />
In this thread, we have probably had 5 people think that you ´steal´ the spell from the target.... and another person post 4 times thinking you used it on an enemy player as a sort-of debuff.<br />
<br />
Honestly, after reading this thread I know now why there is an add-on that has to tell people to not stand in fire.<br />

you do NOT lose your spell. The absolute worst thing that can happen to you is that you GAIN a spell that you don´t really need.

Who's talking bout losing spells? <br />
<br />
Mass Dispel &amp; Dispersion and even Leap of Faith are about factor 10 more important spells as Entangling Roots is. People are talking about giving class defying spells to the druid and getting shit in return and even tho some have utility they are placed on completely wrong specs and most of those symbiosis spells are focusing mostly on PvP<br />
<br />
What will a holy/disc priest do with Entangling Roots in a PvE environment for example? <br />
<br />
I know these are nowhere near final, I still think they are completely missed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you mean by &quot;giving&quot; and &quot;return&quot; anyway. It's not like druids are just getting those spells in their spell book forever. They are just lending it for the duration of a bossfight/arena match. You're still there with your precious class and its defining abilities, without you druid won't be able to cast it. You're just allowing the druid to cast it for you if you will. Even if you didn't get anything &quot;in return&quot;, it would still be by no means &quot;unfair&quot;. Actually getting something too out of it is just the icing on the cake. It's not a &quot;return&quot; as you didn't give anything up for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you are still missing the fact that YOU are getting a new level 87 spell. Druids are getting this.<br />
<br />
Let´s just break it down more simple for you. Let´s pretend you get NOTHING from the druid. that you completely ignore the abiltiy you are given<br />
<br />
As a moonkin, at level 87, I am given a poor man´s version of mirror image.. assuming I am grouped with a mage, if not, then I don´t really get crap.<br />
As a mage, at level 87, you are given Alter Time. (the new spell for mages).... oh, and at times, you will also have a healing spell from symbiosis.<br />
<br />
The benefit the moonkin and the target receives SHOULD NOT be balanced, since this is OUR SPELL that is being used. You not only get YOUR SPELL, but you also might get something from us that may be useful. I know pretty much every tank would want the ability they get from druids.<br />
<br />
If this was an ability that was in ADDITION to our other level 87 spell, then there would be an argument that it should be more fair.</div></div><hr />

It's been a while since I've played a priest, but there is a potential benefit to having roots as a healer. As far as I'm aware, Mind Control is the only CC a priest has (this may have changed since Wrath). Roots would give a priest the ability to CC in situation where it would be necessary, without losing the ability to continue to cast heals. I don't see much of an application in a raid environment, but it would work out fairly well for PUG dungeon groups, when people don't look out for their teammates. Is it great for a healer, no, probably not (nature's grasp would be better), but it does have the potential to be useful from time to time.<br />
<br />
Several other people have mentioned this, but it's better than nothing at all. Druids don't get any new special spell at 87 other than Symbiosis. You don't have to use the spell given by the druid, but of course it would be ideal if the spell you get is as useful as the spell the druid gets in return. At least nobody is losing a spell, both gain something. As you mentioned, I'm sure we'll see many revisions to this. I'm definitely puzzled by a few of the choices right now as well.</div></div><hr />

Tell me where I said you lose your abilities.... All I'm saying is that the druid get crazy good, class defining abilities. It will undoubtedly mess with the balance of the game if symbiosis stays the way it currently is. But I guess that's too hard to see outside the druids PoV.<br />
<br />
I'm not worried about gaining a spell I don't need, I'm more concerned about druids getting spells that are too good for a class that already has an insane toolbox.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If this was an ability that was in ADDITION to our other level 87 spell, then there would be an argument that it should be more fair.<br />
<br />
Actually, believe it or not, I would be happier if the druid would just take/copy a spell from a class and not give anything in return. They can not possibly balance this out properly no matter how you turn it, some classes/specs will get better spells while others will get shafted with lesser spells. <br />
<br />
Yes tanks would like it, since they get good stuff that is actually useful to their playstile, while healers and DPS get stuff that is nowhere near their job description. Why would a Mage or Warlock go heal in the middle of the fight? Why would a Priest root and why would a Shaman who is supposed to heal prowl around? <br />
<br />
The only healer that got useful stuff within their job description is the Holy Paladins, who got Rebirth, but that's to be expected with Blizzards pet classes the Pala and the Druid. <br />
<br />
And I know this is the beta, but few beta patches ago Priest had Cyclone now they changed it to Entangling Roots and this shows me that they're trying as hard as possible to avoid giving healers actual useful spells that might come in handy and they're trying as hard as possible to find some reject spells that make no damn sense to give to a healer. Pretty much the same goes for DPS.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard just can't seem to help themselves. They finally get close to the &quot;Bring the Player not the Class&quot; that they've been going on about for the last couple of years, and then go and stick this Achilles heel in.</div></div><hr />

Seriously? Warriors get either an 8 second 60% sprint on a 10 minute cooldown in exchange for Spell Reflect or SHATTERING BLOW (what the actual fuck? ferals that can remove iceblock/bubble? So basically the cata mage then).<br />

And now people are complaining some of those pure dps can get a free healing spell since apparently it's now useless. Make up your damn mind.<br />
<br />
I do agree that tank specs shouldn't get tank cds, it just doesn't go with how the rest of the abilities were designed (i.e not directly improving a spec's role).<br />
<br />
Honestly I'm at a point where I'm actually starting to think they should just go and remove the &quot;give a spell to the linked class&quot; part of symbiosis. Or give you all teleport moonglade. Maybe people would stop whining and move on then.<br />
<br />
But then again, even if the class receiving symbiosis gained the entire druid toolkit, people would still complain that it's not enough and that &quot;half of these abilities are useless to me!&quot;</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hey guys, rogues have probably been too strong this tier. What do we do?&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh, oh, I know: Let's make prep do not reset smoke bomb any more.&quot;<br />
&quot;I have an idea: Let's put prep on the same tier as the mobility talents, so that rogues either have to stand/waddle around doing nothing (especially with 8 sec CD on dispels) or lose damage/utility/escape possibilities.&quot;<br />
&quot;Let's give them growl as their symbiosis spell to make sure they won't ever use it in PvE or PvP.&quot;<br />
...<br />
&quot;Guys, guys, I have the best idea ever: Let's do all of this at once!&quot;<br />

I don't even play my rogue much btw... he's been 85 for months and has still green/blue gear.<br />

EVERY other class got a cool spell or talent that EMPOWERS them or let them DEAL DMG.<br />

Many and many people said me &quot;He Nephyron it's beta, everything can change&quot;. NO, after 7 years I've learned that what blizz release at the beginning will be the final product with some tweaks, but the base of won't change.<br />
They have decided to give Hearth of Wild to druids as lvl 90 talent -&gt; the druid community think it sucks -&gt; they change the tooltip every patch and continue to keep that shi*<br />
They have decided that Symbiosis will be the lvl 87 druid ability -&gt; the druid community think it's nice for PvP, but want something usable everywhere -&gt; they continue give nothing for PvE</div></div><hr />

They're removing Dark Intent as a targeted buff for this reason, and here they are bringing in something potentially much more dangerous. <br />
<br />
I think they should increase the benefit that the Druid receives, but only provide utility bonuses to the target. Extra Tank cool-downs or Tranquility are too powerful and we'll end up having to have a Druid in the raid for each Tank, or worse - several Shadow Priests and several Druids for blanket Tranqs... it's madness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How pissed off would you Druids be, if me....a hunter. Clicked off Symbiosis every time it was put on me(hoping that would cancel any spell you received from me). This spell will be the NUMBER ONE complaint about all forms of play in MOP. PVP/PVE whatever it is, the amount of Raging that will go on with this spell, will dwarf anything that has ever been seen in the 7 years or so WOW has been out. I honestly want no part of it.<br />
There is a reason that in SWTOR with the new Legacy system, that they dont allow you to use...for example Force abilities on your Bounty Hunter. The amount of balance needed for PVE/PVP is not worth the effort. So it was relegated to basically solo use on a long cooldown.<br />
You Druids with your rose tinted glasses can't see how much damage this spell will do to the game. Again, i want no part of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
You lost me at SWTOR.</div></div><hr />

On PvE side druids will always be forced to cast it on tanks (unless they are tank themself).</div></div><hr />

I'm not complaining about this, what about the heal that the Spirit Wolf gives ?</div></div><hr />

Ice Block is critically important for mages, and Healing Touch is utterly useless. How is this fair in the arena? OMG BLIZZ!!!<br />

Learn to read!!!<br />

YOU keep your ice block and symbiosis copies it to so we get ice block aswell...</div></div><hr />
