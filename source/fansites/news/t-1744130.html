Armory Stats - Proving Grounds<br />
Today we are taking a look at the proving grounds achievement completion rate of players. The data used today is a sample of 6.1 million characters from 3.1 million accounts. We also did this at the end of Mists of Pandaria, which you can see here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4556-Armory-Stats-Mists-of-Pandaria-Proving-Grounds-Blue-Tweets-Blizzard-Art). <br />
<br />
It appears that many more people did proving grounds thanks to the minimum requirement for heroic dungeons, but less people have gotten around to doing Endless this time around. The number of healers and tanks is somewhat more even now<br />
<br />
You can see scoreboards on WoWProgress for DPS (http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_damage), Healing (http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_healer), and Tank (http://www.wowprogress.com/char_statistics/field.pg_tank) endless.<br />
<br />
A Monk recently got to wave 230 of Tank Endless and shared a video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C4T-FHGbQRI). Be sure to leave any requests for stats you want to see in the comments!<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Runesaber Mount<br />
Where is it?<br />
Grooming. We'll let you know when it's ready to make its way into Azeroth proper. (You know how cats can be.)<br />
<br />
but I can't help a feeling a sense of condescending attitude with that remark.<br />
I can assure you there was no condescension in my post at all. I think it's very easy for people to extrapolate what they like out of text sometimes, but if you were familiar with my style of communication, you'd understand. This was merely my way of skirting &quot;soon&quot; and letting people know it's not a forgotten thing. We'll get everyone the information when we are all clear to do so. Don't worry. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/366060-runesaber-mount/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16780658037?page=2#38))<br />
<br />
World Bosses<br />
There are world bosses that you can kill weekly. I do one a week and I find groups by the premade group finder.<br />
This. There are often quite a few premade groups looking for people to do these bosses. Perhaps what you aren't seeing is people in chat asking for more people since they're using this system instead? (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/366057-world-bosses/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16774227461?page=1#4))<br />
<br />
Clicking Abilities<br />
I click one-off, raid cooldown and/or super rarely used abilities I keep in smaller bars above my keybound action bars. I don't particularly want to create yet another modifier key, or attempt to contort my hand just to reach bizarre binds I rarely use. It works for me, I do just fine, and I'm not involved in any situations where it adversely affects my performance relative to the content I'm involving myself in. I think if you get into a situation though where you're attempting to increase your performance, or underperforming and wondering why, then certainly keybinds and quick use of abilities can make a big difference. But, at least personally, I'm not looking to break any records in Normal mode progression.<br />
<br />
When you have direct contact with developers and have been a forum poster for 10 years, do you really want to admit all you do is normal (flex) mode? How.. odd.<br />
If someone wants to openly expose that they are judgmental of how others choose to enjoy a form of entertainment, then I'm not going to stop them. It's helpful to understand who people are. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/366072-any-other-scumbag-clickers-out-there/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/16716771799?page=8#157))<br />
<br />
WoW Tokens<br />
Opinions (on inflation)?<br />
I won't speculate on economic impact, but one thing I find interesting to ponder is where the wealthy acquired their wealth from, and if any wealth lost/spent won't just be reacquired from those same sources.<br />
<br />
I will add, I suspect Blizzard is going to price the tokens higher for the buyers than the sellers receive to create a gold sink they can adjust at will. So they will have a handle on inflation.<br />
The gold price is dynamic based on supply and demand. Aside from setting a starting gold price when the system is first turned on, the fluctuating cost is determined by the market.

Blue Tweets<br />
Art<br />
Hi, all my friends and I loved the Human/Orc HD armor. Any plan to do more in the future, say all racial city guards armor?<br />
It's a big art job, made sense for garrisons because you had human/orc guards by default, we'll see what happens in the future! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/578788297448648704))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Could it be possible for tier tokens to show warforged/socket/tertiary before they are consumed?<br />
Due to technical limitations, we don't have plans for this at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578996377776091136))<br />
<br />
Please tell me that there are plans for other uses of Draenic Stone. I have been hoarding them in my reagent bank in hope.<br />
We gave them a good sell price, but at this time there are no other plans. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578996761718468608))<br />
<br />
Characters under lvl 100 can't see ore/herb/fur/etc. traders. By design? Alts are people too!<br />
You need a level 3 Garrison, but you can visit someone else’s to pick these quests up before then. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/578996951892414464))<br />
<br />
((Why does Darkmoon Adventurer's Guide not work in WoD content? Never see an artifact drop in instances.))<br />
That item is currently being revamped and will make its triumphant return very soon! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/579010411535593472))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
map goals concise on HotS load screen. I have no idea wtf the goal is in most wow pvp maps<br />
Yes I very much like their loading screens. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/579044733374242816))<br />

Wildstar - Companion Pets and Holo-Wardrobe<br />
Wildstar has some fun new additions in an upcoming patch. Non-combat companion pets are coming to the game, obtainable from many different sources. <br />
<br />
The new Holo-Wardrobe is also part of this patch. It allows you to save item appearances to an account wide list of appearances. You can edit a costume and swap the appearance in an item slot with any appearance you have unlocked for that slot. A similar system was mentioned for a future WoW update in previous developer interviews.<br />

Blizzard is able to do a system like it. Diablo III works with an unlock system. You loot an item, you can now use it for transmog. They even have dyes in Diablo III.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its not like they've been having their main teams working on it 24/7 in some sort of race. Far as we know blizz just barely finished the groundwork for patch 6.2 and waiting for after 6.3 is finished to start work on it for 7.0.<br />
<br />
Its not like the mass transmog feauture is remotely needed. its will just make an already good system more functional.</div></div><hr />

It's definitly a hurdle. They could split it up between expansions or even tier/non tier and stuff though. Sure, it'll require you to search through all the gear a bit (unless they add a search function) but it'll be far better than haviving a bank/void storage 90% for cosmetic puroses.<br />

How's Wildstar doing nowadays?<br />
<br />
Well, they barely make as much money as City of Heroes did before they closed and they have about 37k subs, according to those who can do the maths. That should tell you how &quot;well&quot; it's doing. Other than that, nothing has barely changed.</div></div><hr />

Does this include old proving grounds? I know I haven't bothered trying dps or healer since I already have the title from last Xpac but did endless tank as I never got around to it in mop? Considering how rare all 3 endless is this could (relatively) massively skew the datum.<br />

Nope, the old achievements were moved to legacy achievements.</div></div><hr />

The general subreddit traffic trend usually matches the game activity and interest.

<br />
Yeah because two half-hearted raids, Garrisons(Facebook game), and selfies are the height of MMO content.<br />
<br />
Come on people, stop pretending Blizzard actually really does anything with the millions it makes besides churn out one excuse after the other. They've really become slow and lackluster in post-expansion content and even before recent most of their focus was entirely on raid content. It was a miracle to get something besides that without, yet again, another expansion release.<br />
<br />
Many developers output a considerable amount more that tends to be much more varied, on much less resources. The difference is? Blizzard has a bunch of old content most of us have done and or is obsolete at this point that people like to harp as being somehow additive to the game. Does it make it feel bigger overall? Sure. In the same way a girl stuffing her shirt makes her tits look bigger.<br />
<br />
Now I see why they get away with such minimal efforts.</div></div><hr />

DPS 77.7 / 89.8 = 86.5% of bronze dps tried and did silver.<br />

Hell I did not even want to do bronze, let alone have to do silver. I think the proving grounds are a complete waste of time. If they had not made them a requirement, they would of still been in line with the amount of people that completed at least silver in MoP. Forcing people into do something is hardly reflect of the people that willing like to do these types of thing. So even these graph does not honestly tell who felt they wanted to do this as opposed to who only did it because they had to in order to do three heroic dungeons for the legendary ring chain. That is another thing had Blizzard not tied at least one normal and 3 heroic dungeons to the chain, I doubt they would of had as many do the proving ground this time around as they did, so that further makes this graph more skewed.</div></div><hr />

Sure it did. WoW is bigger in a way that is not substantial but more superficial. Basically, I was saying his argument is invalid and it's that sort of thinking that keeps Blizzard in a relaxed position while they continue to churn out less than most other developers despite having budget and resources that dwarf anyone else several times over.</div></div><hr />

This is a little harder, but I might be able to grab the last date a player killed a specific boss. The question is what to do with the inactive characters that haven't logged on in weeks / months.</div></div><hr />

That's because Wildstar was designed ground-up to be flexible enough to be able to accomodate those things. WoW's base coding is a fair bit more rigid, and thus it's harder to make big changes to it.<br />

The funny thing is they never fixed the frame rate problems that I know of...

On topic: I really loved the aesthetics of wildstar.. Hell I even loved the game in general before I reached level 50 and discovered how grindy end-game was. Which was a shame.

I will inevitably give wildstar a try one of these days, but until they change the end game to be slightly more accessible so it isn't like pulling teeth to knock things out, I'm just not going to worry about it too much.<br />

The proving grounds requirement to do Heroic Dungeons should be removed. It is terribly unequal for different classes. My Hunter did Silver easily on like the 3rd try at an iLvl of 610. My Warlock is at 651 and still can't do it.<br />
<br />
It's all strategy, and it scales to ilvl, higher or lower... It's easier at lower ilvl with higher weapons then average ilvl<br />

<br />
It's really not unequal. Some classes are harder than others and you can't do heroics till you figure that out. <br />
<br />
Also, proving grounds scales with you so ILVL shouldn't matter.<br />
<br />
As a warlock. Use GoSac with the felhunter or keep it out. He can interrupt the healers. After that, I can't really see you having any trouble because all 3 specs have decent enough aoe to complete it if you know how to prioritize and move out of the the way of the globules.</div></div><hr />

there is literally zero reason to do anything after silver<br />
<br />
Achievements / titles? Curiousity in seeing how far you can go compared to other players (wowprogress rankings for endless proving grounds makes this easy)? <br />
<br />
Do you only do things in this game if there is some loot incentive? Actually, if they added rewards to proving grounds, it would be cool... like a mount for beating wave 40 or something. kek<br />
<br />
I found endless fun the first couple times, but it literally takes like 30-40 minutes to back to my high score point where things become difficult... endless should ramp up way faster IMO or begin at the equivalent of level 20 or so. Shouldn't be a test of patience.</div></div><hr />

Optimization: Much better now. I have personally seen 30 frame increases<br />
End game Grind: Like all mmos it is still grindy, but so much less now, took me 2 days to do the updated attunement, and there is just a ton of content now, with more on the way.<br />
PvP: Balance is fixed for the most part, they seem to be changing it to a hybrid Gw2/WoW pvp system<br />
Raids: No more 40 mans because they are dumb, new boss in a box raid coming in the next update, THAT USES THE ULDUAR DIFFICULTY SYSTEM!'<br />
<br />
<br />
Just going to say this because most of you play WoW so you would understand more.<br />
6.1: Twitter integration<br />
A few daily quest<br />
QoL and reasons to repeat old content.<br />
1.3 (drop 5): Daily Zone (with varrying dailies to keep em fresh, really fun on PTR)<br />
1 boss ulduar style raid<br />
1 new adventure<br />
new 5-20 man event. <br />
PvP rallying (like what WoD does)<br />
Contracts, altering missions that can actually buy raid gear eventually. Reasons to go out in the worl<br />
Halo-Wardrobe<br />
Companion Pets.<br />
<br />
That will probably be more than 6.2 as well not counting raid content.</div></div><hr />

Thats me. <br />
But dont get me wrong, I didnt complain and throw a fit over needing to do some PvP for the MoP legendary. It's not my thing, but it wasnt hard to get the wins and I think it was great that the legendary quest made you participate in all aspects of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a comparable game is FFXI (two years older than WoW and was built up first as an MMO on PS2 in Japan first before having PC release later).<br />
<br />
They recently implemented the ability to equip 2 linkshells. http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxi/threads/45762-lsmes2-Can-we-have-it?p=538507#post538507<br />
<br />
From January 2015 <br />
We checked to see if allowing the secondary linkshell message to appear would be possible, but it seems we will not be able to address this.<br />
<br />
FFXI was created with the concept that only one linkshell would be able to be equipped. With the January version update, while it appears that you are able to equip two linkshells, internally you are still actually only equipping a single linkshell.<br />
<br />
As for a suggestion made on the Japanese side of the forums, to make it so you can switch the controls between LS1 and LS2, we determined that this would take a lot more resources to overcome hurdles that are higher and more complex than making it possible to check the LS message.<br />
<br />
In order to check the LS message or make it so it’s possible to use the same features as LS1 with LS2, we would have to dig deep into the core of the FFXI system and totally revamp it so multiple linkshells could actually be equipped. However, this is essentially the amount of work required to totally build a new chat system from the ground up, so it’s not a realistic option at this point.<br />
<br />
March 2015 Update (http://forum.square-enix.com/ffxi/threads/46531-Mar-26-2015-%28JST%29-Version-Update).<br />
<br />
<br />
Linkshell messages from both primary and secondary linkshells are now displayed upon logging in.<br />
<br />
A text command to display sublinkshell messages has been added.<br />
/linkshell2mes, /ls2mes<br />
Allows the player to view their current sublinkshell group’s welcome message.<br />
* Players must set a linkshell to be their primary one in order to edit these messages.<br />
<br />
<br />
Welp, that was fast.<br />
<br />
Also this. Even FFXI beats WoW's vanity system.<br />
<br />
/lockstyle functionality has been changed.<br />
A category for locking/unlocking character equipment appearance has been added to the Misc. 3 section of the Config submenu.<br />
Style Lock<br />
This category has the same effect as the /lockstyle commands.<br />
Selecting “Static” will lock the character’s appearance.<br />
The conditions for a character’s appearance to be automatically unlocked have been changed to the following<br />
When changing jobs.<br />
New functions have been added to the /lockstyle text command.<br />
A Style Lock category has been added to the Edit Equipment Set section of the Macros submenu<br />
Players may lock in their equipment appearance by registering an equipment set, selecting it, and then choosing Style Lock.<br />
Method for Fixing Appearance<br />
Players may select which equipment set they would like to have displayed by using the /lockstyleset command together with the number of a registered equipment set.<br />
/lockstyleset [equipment set number]<br />
Sets your character’s appearance to be that of the designated equipment set. Not designating a number will display the currently equipped items. This command may also be used while appearance is currently locked.<br />
<br />
Ex. “/lockstyleset 1” will fix the character’s appearance at that of the equipment designated in equipment set 1.<br />
* This command may only be executed once every ten seconds in order to reduce server load.<br />
Method for unlocking equipment apperance<br />
Appearance may be unlocked by turning off the option from the config menu or using the /lockstyle command once more.<br />
Read on for information about equipment sets.<br />
The conditions for which equipment may be used with the style lock functionality have been changed.<br />
If these conditions are fulfilled, players are able to display even equipment that is not usable by their current job. The new conditions for /lockstyle are as follows.<br />
The player must be in possession of the piece.<br />
The player must fulfill the conditions to equip the piece on at least one job they have acquired.<br />
For weapons, the weapon type for main and sub weapons must be the same as those currently equipped.<br />
<br />
<br />
In FFXI, you can have 100 gear sets (you can also mix and match). You can swap appearance to 1 of those gear sets at any time.<br />
<br />
FFXI dev team is the best.</div></div><hr />

Four months since the expansion launched and all we've seen is a raid that was delayed from launch rolled out prior to 6.1, Twitter integration and a couple toys.

Yeah, due to old and foolish one way transfers between PvP servers to PvE, the two PvP servers are suffering. While the two PvE ones are noticeably better off. Which...now that I think about it, was an important factoid/bit of context that you intentionally left out. In you mentioning your video. Hmm...seems like a little bit disingenuousness on your part.<br />

Wildstar you are no one's main game. You are something people try out in addition to their other game(s), so you should cater way more to casualss<br />
Stop the hardcore humbug!<br />
<br />
Despite the comforting and pervasive meme by the worst of players (who used an obvious tongue-in-cheek joke as a crutch), the game hasn't really been that &quot;Hardk0re&quot;. And the more grindy of elements, they've kinda reduced over the past two patches. Especially with attunment and Amp/Skill point obtainment. Seems like the game IS catering towards casuals more.</div></div><hr />

It's really a L2P issue. I did Silver on my Warlock months ago in quest and pvp gear (WAY below 651), I had to respec from Affliction to demo but I finished it after a couple tries.</div></div><hr />

Good god, then just delete your lock. I got almost all the way through GOLD the VERY FIRST TIME I went in on my lock, I was at like ilevel 580 or so, fresh ding'd 100. Bronze and Silver were cakewalks, and I've never done PGs before, I've never watched videos of them, I had absolutely no idea what to expect. The dude would tell me what each new mob did, and I would kill them, simple as that. I did it as Destro, btw. I'd imagine I could've gotten through Gold easily if my ilevel had been higher.<br />
<br />
My DK will be my next 100, I guess I'll see how hard they are for him. But my lock had absolutely no problems at all getting Silver done, and my lock is about my 10th out of 12th most used class...I only leveled him first because he's the GM of my guild. I also took over a year off from WoW and only came back at the start of March.</div></div><hr />
