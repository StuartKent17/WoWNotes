Patch 5.2 Tweets<br />
More Patch 5.2 info appeared on Twitter today! <br />
Are you happy with the burst damage in PVP? What changes can we expect? You nerf items, are you still going to nerf spells too?ty <br />
It's prolly still too high. We're def looking at specific abilities/cooldowns. You'll likely see 5.2 changes to major outliers. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/281469807398891520))<br />
<br />
How about a stacking buff for your farm that reduces pests the more consecutive days you plant/till?<br />
Been brainstorming w/ @DaveKosak &amp; @mumper flavorful ways to make farmers more efficient at tending w/ time. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/281471493777522689))<br />
<br />
Are there any plans to buff Unholy Death Knights? It's really sad how underpowered this spec is right now. <br />
You'll likely see some love in 5.2. Unrelated, my current main is Unholy. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/281551898320990208))<br />
<br />
Can this mount collector expect to see some new mounts in 5.2? (Still hoping for 200+ mount achievement!) <br />
New mounts not a bad thing to hope for, I reckon. (Source (https://twitter.com/CM_Zarhym/status/281470052249767937))<br />
<br />
Lor'themar assemblies the troops after the Purge of Dal. Is that to attack Ally or Garrosh or to take to Pandaria? <br />
Lor'themar's plans will be clear once 5.2 starts! (Source (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/280552214286725120))<br />

Maybe you guys have not noticed how op Fluxfire Feline (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/68838-fluxfire-feline) is. Wind-Up (http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/459-wind-up) with Supercharge (http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/208-supercharge) damage 1800+ <br />
Yup, changes on this combo are coming in 5.2.0. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/281114050237169666))<br />
<br />
Please roll bandages and upgrade stones into the battle pet journal UI or make them acct. bound so we can mule them. Bag space<br />
Bandages stack up to 25 in 5.2.0. We intend for players to use stones, not stockpile. Hence the low stack size.<br />
Can they at least become boa? cutting the many stacks we have basically in half doesn't really help much. <br />
Battle Pet Bandages bind to Battle.net accounts in 5.2.0 as well. It's like we read your mind! (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/281434644396773377))<br />
<br />
Is it intended that the &quot;Nether Roach (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/62625-nether-roach)&quot; does not count as cockroach, so its Apocalypse (http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/519-apocalypse) ability kills itself? <br />
This is fixed in 5.2.0 (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/281519611126632448))<br />
<br />
Also, does this mean being pulled out of a battle due to PVP/PVE agro will also despawn the pet? <br />
We have some plans in regards to making this all smoother in 5.2.0, we will share info soon. PVP interaction was not changed. (Source (https://twitter.com/mumper/status/281584334811586560))<br />

Do you know why battle pets don't show up in my auctions on mobile app? <br />

Changes to Tillers Farm<br />
I love my farm. I love that I have all of my best friends to help me with my farm. But wouldn't it be nice if...<br />
<br />
You could jump onto Miss Fifi and stamp all the vermin out of your occupied soil.<br />
Your dog would chase away the birds from your alluring veggies.<br />
The chickens would lay eggs.<br />
The pigs would...fertilize...a crop or two....<br />
While some of this has to do with tuning, we are considering some improvements to the farm and in this area. We might need to adjust the numbers a bit to reduce, say, Alluring over time. But we do want to make you feel that you need to tend to things regularly, even if you become more efficient in handling it. Though, perhaps we can consider allowing more crops to randomly grow without any obstacles or challenges, especially after youâ€™ve proven your farming savvy. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248736-dreaming-of-the-farm/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7416263256?page=1#5))<br />
<br />
PvP Balance Feedback<br />
Would you agree its more balanced than it was from the start of the season up to the new patch? <br />
<br />
I think it is, but there is still alot of tweaks you could say that need to be worked out.<br />
I agree that it has gotten better, but we know that there's more ground to cover and we're always working to improve. In light of that, there are still many more changes coming in patch 5.2. <br />
<br />
I can't talk about them just yet, but keep your eyes open for more information in the coming weeks. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248737-pvp-getting-more-balanced/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7415462899?page=1#19))<br />
<br />
Elder Charms Mandatory?<br />
charm are mandatory if you want to be up to par, if you're lucky you get 3 extra items per week<br />
They aren't mandatory though. You can raid just fine without them. Yes, you won't gear as fast (assuming you get items from them relatively often), but it's not going to impact your character in a negative way, other than *perhaps* missing an upgrade (since you don't even have the guarantee you'll get one through the charms). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248742-blue-post-says/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6161067458?page=1#19))<br />
<br />
Elder Charms in LFR<br />
On Raid Finder you can use the coin on bosses you've already killed that week. And every time you'll have the same chance of getting loot. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248745-verify-about-elder-charms/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6200810354?page=1#4))<br />
<br />
LFR Loot System Feedback<br />
Actually it won't make a difference. Under the old system, a boss would drop 4 or 5 items that would be split among 25 people. With the current system, everyone has an individual chance for loot which means that 3 shamans and 4 paladins may very well each get that shield they need. It is also mathematically possible that all 25 people in the raid get an item from one boss and that the next boss has no loot for anyone.<br />
Exactly this. <br />
<br />
With the old system, you not only had to hope that the item you needed dropped in the first place, you also had to roll against many people to get it. We were hearing a lot of feedback that the need/greed system was being used incorrectly by people that didn't actually need items, but pressed Need anyway. This new system takes that factor out of the equation completely. <br />
<br />
Yes, it does mean that you will occasionally get an item you already haveâ€”think of this as winning something that no one needed with a Greed rollâ€”but it also means you'll never lose an item you need to someone who doesn't need it, as happened previously. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248739-please-fix-lfr-lootsystem/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6160657367?page=1#12))<br />
<br />
Archaeology Feedback<br />
Archaeology is also a secondary profession, which kind of implies it should not provide better items or improvements than primary professions. Of course on the other hand, being a secondary profession makes it possible for everyone to have it which makes it a somewhat nice profession since it sort of implies equality between players. <br />
<br />
The truth is, archaeology is not for everyone, although we have cut down on the necessary travel time to find dig sites by having 6 dig locations per site instead of 3, and added some extra surprise dig sites in Pandaria, thereâ€™s still players who wonâ€™t go for it, and thatâ€™s perfectly fine, thereâ€™s a lot of different content in MoP that was made to appeal to different kinds of players.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that weâ€™re still in the very early stages of MoP, we have said that we wanted to keep updating the game and adding patches more frequently with this expansion, chances are, professions might also get some love with some of those patches, so donâ€™t despair, itâ€™s still only the beginning.<br />
<br />
Whenever we have some news regarding updates to any of the professions we'll make sure to let you know. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248714-what-about-archaeology/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6161066590?page=1#3))<br />

Professions<br />
yeah said that a while back. Did the mode spawn rate increase, maybe?<br />
We felt that at the 1:3 conversion that Spirits were simply a GL delivery mechanism and not used for other things. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/273612006651744256))<br />

why the change to daily/acct for Blingtron? It was just a fun prize... I don't see harm in it being per character <br />

What's the thinking for tailoring putting new, larger bag recipe behind 2 rep grinds? Was 12 daily crafts per bag not enough?<br />
Making Imperial Silk takes a commitment of logging in for 2 min a day. Not much gameplay there. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/275621122932879360))<br />

Have you guys considered something cooperative like the AQ gates war effort to get people out and about? Was a great event.<br />

with all the success of wow what 3 things do you think blizzard could improve upon?<br />
If you mean WRT WoW, I'd say 1) Faster content, 2) More direction at max level, 3) easier for returning players to ease back in. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/269560395805626368))<br />

Given how useless first aid is these days with all classes having heal mechanics. The amount of mats needed for it could be high enough that most player would still rather go to stable masters. That you don't have bandages at all sucks especially while starting with pet battles...cause those fights at the beginning only last a few seconds. Later on thise ain't a problem anymore cause the fights last longer and that in combination with the bandages from masters is usually enough(which is why I had about 250 bandages today and sold 150 of them).<br />
<br />
Archeology definitely needs some love. New items for the old races...and a value update for the keystones(when archeology was released it was great to find those keystones while digging cause they actually really helped to speed up the creation process. With all the changes in archeology they pretty much lost their value and hence there is no &quot;well, just another common item...but at least I found a keystone to use on my next rare&quot;-effect. I want that back. Upgrade them. 2 could finish one item...3 a rare.....or make them increase the chance to get a rare item in research next...or make them count as some kind of currency for new special items just like the crytals for the cloudsnake. There are plenty way to make them interesting again).</div></div><hr />

I think what happens is sometimes readers here miss the dev comment (or conversation) that is the inspiration for the comic. If you missed the real discussion, this looks nonsensical... but if you happened to have read the conversation, you find the humor.<br />

Well this Blink is stupid.<br />
<br />
Mark of Kil'jaeden can only be turned in up to revered. After that you need Mark of Sargeras.<br />
<br />

Can anyone out there please enlighten me what the fuss about this robot is all about? I seriously don't get it.<br />
<br />
Bingatron used to allow every character on your account to get a gift. So people would plop one down, then log in on 10 alts to maximize their chance of getting a 1 in 100,000 mount. For the players that canÂ´t limit themselves and feel they have to max their opportunities, it was an anoyance to have to log in and out so much.<br />
<br />
So now you can only get 1 Bingatron gift per account per day. Nobody knows if Blizzard changed the mount drop rate or not. Wowhead currently has over 100,000 boxes opened with 1 mount so far...</div></div><hr />

See what I don't understand in all of this is the tweet where GC says Blingtron is a chore. Blingtron is probably the most optional thing in the game. It takes next to nothing to complete, and by the same token awards you next to nothing. How is it the blingtron is a chore and dailies aren't? Blingtron needs a nerf but dailies don't?</div></div><hr />

There's a chance for a mount. That alone is enough for some people to do anything to get it. And others will do it out of fear of being &quot;left behind&quot;.</div></div><hr />

And you tell me what you need to do dailies for on alts?<br />
<br />
1. Gear - for what? Raid and get gear, otherwisee do heroics and LFR. There is no reason to grind out reps for gear for alts.<br />
<br />
2. Prof Recipes - You donÂ´t really have to grind anything now. You can get Revered with Klaxxi just by questing through the zone from 84 to 85. Enchanting? Save your self the headache.. sell your sha crystals and buy the enchants from the AH.. half the time you will make gold in the process. Tailor bags are a big vanity item similar to mounts. Nobody needs 2 extra slots.<br />
<br />
Dailies are NOT a chore mainly because they are content, they are story, they are the RPG part of the game. If you have done the new rep and havenÂ´t been blown away by the story, then you should just grab a calculator and play a spreadsheet somewhere.<br />
<br />
But really, the question I always ask and never get an answer to.. if you have a main, and you have an alt.. what else are you going to be doing? Most of the reps take less than 20 minutes to do. Some of them like AC take 5 mins.. What else are you going to be doing in that time that isnÂ´t a bigger grind? more heroic dungeons? Farming ore?<br />
<br />
I think people just canÂ´t control themselves with dailies and do too many, then got burned out. I have revered with every faction on my main, I also have revered with 2 factions on my priest alt. I donÂ´t think I ever did more than one quest hub per day on both of them. I always have capped VP and have lucky charms out the butt.<br />
<br />
The problem isnÂ´t with Reps, it is with people who are semi-OCD with being a completionist.. OMG, I must be able to ride a cloud serpent on all 11 alts. I must be able to craft every item in the game within the first 2 months of the expansion. Trust me, I have enchanting on my main... at almost any given moment the AH is selling the Â´goodÂ´enchants for less than the mats... I am in no hurry to Â´grindÂ´ LWer through GL so I can make leg enchants that sell for less than the mats too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Charms mean you need 45/week on average for as long as the system remains. I don't care one bit about rep but I still need to do 45 dailies a week.</div></div><hr />
