We think mages are still having mana problems and don't want to reduce Evocation's cooldown anymore. Nor do we want to buff mage armor too much more or using e.g. molten armor seems pointless.<br />
<br />
Instead, we reduced the mana cost on Fireball, Frostbolt, Frostfire Bolt, Arcane Blast, Arcane Missiles, and Arcane Explosion. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Arena testing and bug exploits<br />
As to Arenas, yes we are getting much more testing now. Unfortunately it doesn't take much to derail that testing, such as the Typhoon bug, or the POM Pyro bug, or the current weapon multiplier bug. That's the kind of thing that happens in a beta, but it has a much harsher effect when players are trying to beat other players than it does when players are questing or doing raids. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10873897363-ghostcrawler-its-all-we-want.html))<br />
<br />
Pet balancing and GCD<br />
I would like to try a pet model at some point where the pets were sturdy and easily healed, but contributed much less of the total dps (like 15-25% instead of 30-40%).<br />
<br />
The GCD, as I've said, is a good deal trickier. If anything, we regret a little pulling some abilities off of the GCD because that opened the barn door for other requests to remove things from it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10863436434-feedback-middle-ground-for-hunters-gc.html))<br />
<br />
Glyphs pass soon<br />
The glyphs weren't finalized until late, and we had already done a lot of testing and balancing then. They are also a little tricky to adjust because the intent is that they do change what you do slightly, instead of just buffing the buttons you'd already push.<br />
<br />
But we plan on doing a pass on them soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/10871017014-gc--what-is-being-done-for-shaman-glyphs.html))<br />
<br />
Sorting mounts under the &quot;Mounts&quot; tab<br />
We'll try to get some improvements in over time. It's not our highest priority UI feature, however. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10873898539-feedback-unable-to-sort-mounts-under-tab.html))<br />
<br />
Class balance and WotLK release deadline<br />
The numbers aren't done. We changed an awful lot of combat mechanics and we're still adjusting things to get them right. Unholy death knights (I assume that's the spec you are talking about) have some nerfs coming (and I've already posted about them).<br />
<br />
Don't feel like Lich King is a deadline. If anything, it's only a beginning. Even if we had everything absolutely 100% perfectly balanced to our liking, some smart player would figure out that if you combine this talent spec, with this elixir and this trinket and use this set bonus, then bam, your dps goes up by 200 points. That sort of thing is going to happen, and we're just going to have to adjust when it does. Balance is a work in progress, not a destination. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/7/10532602707-can-we-agree-that-were-all-pretty-worried.html))<br />
<br />
Raid diversity in WotLK<br />
I undestand your concern here. It's totally valid. But it's actually the &quot;OMG we need X&quot; mentality that we're trying to get away from. Even a 25-player raid stacked with healers is going to have ~15 slots for dps. Not every raid will have a rogue in one of those spots, but some will, and some will have 3 or 4. We want to restore flexibility back to the group. Our experience is that a lot of guilds are groups of friends, and it sucks when those groups have to sit out mage 3 and 4 just because &quot;full on mages.&quot; If you have a group with exceptional rogues, great. Bring them. You shouldn't be punished for having too many good players.<br />
<br />
Now maybe you're worried that battle rez or battle shout or whatever is still too good and stacks so well that every guild is going to switch to stacking, oh I don't know, 10 Ret pallies for their dps. If that happens, and we're convinced it's really an issue not just players experimenting, then we'll squash it. Because the goal is you bring ~15 dps, not that you bring 10 ret pallies. That violates the &quot;OMG we need X&quot; situation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/7/10532602707-can-we-agree-that-were-all-pretty-worried.html))<br />
<br />
Cleaves in PvE in WotLK<br />
Assuming you are talking about PvE, a big part of that in BC was the boss cleaves that were so deadly to melee and the necessity for crowd control that could pretty much only be done by a mage or priest. That did suck and it wasn't fair and we changed it. You shouldn't be walking into that situation again. Now you can argue that your dps isn't up to par, which is a valid concern (in the sense that I understand why you'd be worried about it, not in the sense that we think it's true). But it is also a concern voiced by probably every class at the moment. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/7/10532602707-can-we-agree-that-were-all-pretty-worried.html))<br />

Black Ice and damage increase spells effects<br />
The Black Ice tooltip may very well still be wrong. Sometimes text doesn't get updated at the same time. But the spell effect should be that Black Ice only buffs Frost. Frost got some other buffs and Unholy got some other nerfs too. These might not all be in the build. I am also going off of memory here, so I may be mistaken.<br />
<br />
Tundra Stalker buffs Obliterate and Howling Blast. Adds double expertise.<br />
Acclimation buffs Rune Strike (in addition to its normal effects).<br />
Crypt Fever down to 10/20/30%.<br />
And the big one... when you miss, your runes activate in 1 sec instead of 2. This makes misses, dodges and parries a lot less painful.<br />
<br />
We are also getting reports of Tundra Stalker not causing extra damage as it should. I can't verify that, but keep it in mind. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/18/10535473208-new-death-knight-changes.html))<br />

Feral abilities<br />
With regard to abilities, we have been torn between giving bears (and cats) more unique abilities versus giving them tanking abilities that many players considered &quot;core.&quot; We could have certainly come up with something more original than Last Stand for bears, but at the time, a lot of bears were comparing laundry lists of buttons and said bears wouln't be invited to raids because they didn't have an oh snap button like Last Stand. We put that functionality in Berserk, then later backed off of that so that we could make Berserk a more fun button to push as bear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/9956326946-snarfsnarf-speaks-help-save-feral-tanking.html))<br />
<br />
Typhoon<br />
I'm not aware of any changes to Typhoon's damage. If you're just talking about Rank 5, we had to just temporarily yank it to make sure it was becoming untrained -- despite the last hotfix, druids were still ending up with it when we added the rank back in. We should be able to add it back next patch.<br />
<br />
Also understand that if it hadn't been abused so much that we wouldn't have had to yank it. It's not terribly fair or helpful to complain about not having access to the ability when it was being used to overpower bosses and other players to such extremes. While the bug was ours (mine in all likelihood), we're not going to be able to get back all of those busted battles, yanno?

<br />
Predatory Instincts reducing AoE Damage by 30% instead of 15%<br />
Predatory Instincts is a huge nerf. You just haven't seen it yet. It only works in cat form.<br />
<br />
I hinted that this might happen before, but as it was, a druid was going to be the only tank people took for dragons like Malygos. That would have been particularly true for any encounter that was supposed to be a resist fight, because the druid could skip a lot of the resist gear. Your health pool should still make sure you handle those fights sufficiently. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10535473265-feral-tanking-nerf-actually-a-buff.html))<br />
<br />
Treants<br />
The Treant health appears to be too low. They aren't updating correctly from your Stamina or level or something. We'll get it fixed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/2/10638059228-i-have-askd-befortreants.html))<br />

Hunters in Arenas<br />
Arenas were not kind to hunters. We do get that. We talk about it all the time. Did we buff hunters too much now for Arenas? I have no doubt you'll disagree, but it is a concern. We need to actually see a lot more arenas (with fewer broken classes in them) to know how things stand. We are trying to make it better, but it's also possible to overdo it. Good for you I guess, but bad for everyone else. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10544540526-its-been-fun-a-hunters-eulogy.html))<br />
<br />
Multi-shot and AOE Damage<br />
I can understand not caring about AE damage if you spend most of you time in PvP, but why would you not want to do AE damage in PvE? People wipe on trash all the time. Even if trash is trivial for you, clearing it faster just means more boss attempts. And even on the bosses, it's getting rare these days to have an encounter that's just a boss without some kind of minions or adds.<br />
<br />
Maybe you're just saying that the AE isn't important enough to go super deep in Marks? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10539073697-serious-question-why-use-multishot.html))<br />

Blessing of Sanctuary<br />
We like Blessing of Sanctuary as a buff you can put on anyone. However, we might do something like let it benefit the paladin more than other targets. (Self buffing gives a better result than buffing someone else.) Or we might just add more paladin mitigation somewhere else in the tree. That all assumes you are deficient. If 2-5% makes a big difference for you (I don't think it will make that much of a difference, but for sake of argument), then buffing paladins 2-5% when they didn't need it could also make the other tanks non-starters. We'll keep testing it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/10532280539-gc-tanking-testing-assumptions.html))<br />
<br />
Shield of the Templar<br />
Okay, here is one change you don't have. Shield of the Templar now also reduces all damage taken by 1/2/3%. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/10532280539-gc-tanking-testing-assumptions.html))<br />
<br />
Critical Block<br />
<br />
Critical Block is something we're still keeping our eye on. I'm not going to promise a paladin version, but it's totally something we'll consider if paladin blocking starts to fall behind.<br />
<br />
Whoever said it, yes it's absolutely going to be a challenge trying to get parity among 4 classes with totally different mechanics, and in some sense the warrior to paladin comparison is the easy one. But we don't like having only one MT class, and we don't like giving everyone very similar gear, talents and abilities to tank, and we don't like the situation where you need a different tank for every fight because they all excell at certain types of encounters and suck at others. So the option we're left with is to have 4 who are different but relatively equal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/5/10532280539-gc-tanking-testing-assumptions.html))<br />
<br />
Retribution paladins<br />
I can't imagine too many people think that DKs (Unholy I presume) and Ret Pallys are balanced. We won't leave things like that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10544540526-its-been-fun-a-hunters-eulogy.html))<br />

Riptide and Restoration tree<br />
Riptide probably isn't going to be a crazy awesome raiding tool *unless* you're in a fight with a lot of movement, in which case it does its job very well. It is situational, but we actually made a lot of the new spells situational because almost every class already had bread and butter abilities well before LK.<br />
<br />
Now, I think it does shine in 5-player dungeons, PvP or in 10-player raids, depending on how many hot-based healers you have. The initial heal could probably be a bit larger. That is something we may change after some more testing.<br />
<br />
I know Resto hasn't gotten as much attention as other shaman specs in this forum, but honeslty we think it's because you work pretty well. Players have gotten made when I've said that before, but particularly in raids, everyone knows what they're going to get from a Resto (CH and Earth Shield) and I don't think that is going away. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/10529928653-developer-goals-for-riptide.html))<br />
<br />
Spirit Wolves<br />
We might have to lower the healing per damage if the damage goes up a lot with the AP changes. In other words, you might not see a buff to healing and damage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/8/10871017574-spirit-wolve-undocumented-buff--its-nice.html))<br />
<br />
Spirit Wolves scaling with AP in NEXT build<br />
I said Strength at one point, but they never did scale off of Strength. In fact they never scaled off of anything. They were the same no matter what your level or gear. We fixed that though, and they should scale very well (using AP, not Str). Let us know if that isn't happening. [...] Then you're going to love them next build.

<br />
No matter what raids will be stacked with all the changes to potions, damage output, basic class requirements, Same goes for talent builds. Theorycraft from all classes will say X build does top damage, healing, tanking or raid utility. This will not go away.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peacemoon</div><div class="date">2008-10-06, 04:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Theorycraft is theorycraft. I would rather spend my theory time on something much more useful like real life medicine. I'm not saying you shouldn't theorize certain things or play intelligently. However a 2%~ difference done by some maths guy is NOT going to be enough to take player A over player B in REAL situations.<br />
<br />
The amount of guilds who take WoW as a job and only take the absolutely best classes of every role are thankfully very few and far between. They also tend not to have much of a community, as they are only using each other for progress so the moment progress tops that type of guild falls apart. Unless they are continuously successful they always fall apart. Continuing success is very difficult to pull off.<br />
<br />
Most guilds though are based on friendship and friends and just attend raids with what they have. I have always led this type of guild, infact we had balance and feral druids, shadow priests and ret paladins in molten core and blackwing lair back in Vanilla WoW when such specs for &quot;healing classes&quot; was ridiculously ridiculed by people. We still were the second guild to kill both Ragnaros and Netharian on our server.<br />
<br />
We do the same now, and just take who are available. Blizzards new concept of balance supports this play style and I for one approve of the direction. We already have a feral druid as our main tank, since he is one of our best players and also the best geared tank we have. Its annoying to find mobs and bosses he cannot tank simply because he is a druid not a warrior.<br />
<br />
<br />
Taking a skilled feral druid over some noob rogue has always been my preferred option of choice. When things start to go bad and unexpected events happen, who is going to be best to adapt to the new situation? The Druid.<br />
<br />
Once people intelligently think about this, the whole question of 2%~ here and 3%~ there will, as said by Ghostcrawler, become just background noise to the majority of the player base. <br />
<br />
I really think people need to stop being such drama queens on this whole issue and stop being so mindless and become more wise. ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
*The image I have is a nest of chicks, all chirping away &quot;buff me! buff me! no nerf him not me! ME!&quot; With Blizzard occasionally feeding each one, pacifying them for a few mere minutes. They can only see their own needs, and not the needs of the nest as a whole, or even the entire flock.</div></div><hr />

Once that is done, the difference in play skill will be far larger than the difference in class ability. Therefore, the only reasons to pick one person over another for a raid spot are: 1.) They are the better player, or 2.) They are your friend.<br />

Tell the Hunters to switch to Viper and refill their mana bar over the next 15 seconds?<br />
<br />
Yes, it causes you to do 50% damage (except not quite, since the pet is still doing damage at 100%). Hunter damage is being balanced assuming you spend x% of the time in Viper doing 50% damage. If they got rid of that, they'd have to flat nerf damage so it came out equal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? The total damage done, the average DPS over the whole fight, comes out the same for both (or will once the balancing is done, I have no idea who is ahead at the moment). In exchange for spending 15 seconds out of every minute (a gross exaggeration on your part, by the way), doing 65% damage (50% of the 70% of damage from Hunter + 30% damage from pet) Hunters will get to see bigger numbers the other 45 seconds.<br />
<br />
If it were switched to an Evocation type ability, then they'd have to DRAMATICALLY reduce the amount of damage Steady Shot and Auto Shot (and Chimera Shot, and Serpent Sting, and Multi-shot) did to keep it even.<br />
<br />
Do you understand that on the beta right now Mages are not doing considerably more damage than Hunters?<br />
<br />
Also... I play a Hunter and have no Mage, though my main going into Wrath will be a Prot Paladin.</div></div><hr />

But i would not want to conclude anything and blame people for it. All this time i have waited for retri to have their moment in the game since through out the time of WoW , retri has given people hard situations to adjust to even though they like it or not as for the mentality of people who are against paladins who play as retribution though it has subsided in the late tbc. The amount of buffs in the recent time span has suprised us players and will make us more tempted to play this class specc but on the other hand by what i see is that blizzard wont leave paladins alone untill they are downgraded to a certain level where they would want it to be.For all i expect out of retribution is that they will not have to land on the same boat as they were all along and would play a darely significant role as all other classes have played in pvp and as well as pve. In my experience i have not tried the the present retri so i would not have a clue but this is a general post which id just like to claim to all retri that there is hope for us now:P which i hope that blizzard does not screw up at their execution of a good game.<br />

Theorycraft from all classes will say X build does top damage, healing, tanking or raid utility. This will not go away. <br />
<br />
Yes and no. Some will, on the basis of the maths alone. Some people are just like that, they want their whole raid to do the BEST DPS POSSIBLE. However, if things are balanced they'll probably find they'll still &quot;need&quot; 2 paladins, 2 shamans, 1 druid, 1 priest for healing and/or party buffs, that's 4 classes covered already. Then you'll have your top 2 DPS classes (melee/ranged). That's class #6. And maybe some boss attack which it's REALLY useful to bring a mage or warlock for, like a ranged tank sort of thing. Which brings us to 7. Then you need a tank, such as a warrior or DK. That's 8, and that's before you've even considered different specs for debuffs, and there are only 10 classes to start with.<br />
<br />
However, the slight advantage given by this edge on DPS should make almost no difference until the final raid dungeon (Arthas / Icecrown). And they should have plently of time to get the balance right before then. Most certainly, this won't be the exact same balance as there is at the launch, so you'll be wasting your efforts trying to sort it out too soon, and gearing up 15 mages because they do 100 DPS more than the next guy in the best gear, only to find them nerfed in the following patch, or their next tier of gear isn't so good, or even just some class-specific trinket issues (deathsworn trinkets etc) allowing warlocks come out in front instead.</div></div><hr />

Don't forget Napkin that spriest's will be giving raid-wide mana, ret paladin's JotW will be regening the mana of the lowest 10 in the raid, and I think even mana-tide totem has become raid wide (amirite?).

Yes, it causes you to do 50% damage (except not quite, since the pet is still doing damage at 100%). Hunter damage is being balanced assuming you spend x% of the time in Viper doing 50% damage. If they got rid of that, they'd have to flat nerf damage so it came out equal.<br />

Yeh kinda like Warlocks atm, we can do a massive amount of damage but we are limited by the extra tiem we have to take life tapping. For those of you who hasn't raided with a warlock i have to say it does take up some time even if you do it smart. <br />
<br />

We like Blessing of Sanctuary as a buff you can put on anyone. However, we might do something like let it benefit the paladin more than other targets. (Self buffing gives a better result than buffing someone else.) Or we might just add more paladin mitigation somewhere else in the tree. That all assumes you are deficient. If 2-5% makes a big difference for you (I don't think it will make that much of a difference, but for sake of argument), then buffing paladins 2-5% when they didn't need it could also make the other tanks non-starters. We'll keep testing it. (Source)<br />

If you want to be lazy please dont play any class... or rather, remain in Kara or Heroics where you can be lazy all you want. Almost all the other classes have to work at micro managing how they regain mana so that they can sustain their dps, so excuse me if people find you're being absurd by complaining about a little micro management when your autoshot still outputs a fair amount of dps when you're out of mana.</div></div><hr />

Warlocks don't use destro pots unless they literally have 2 shadow priests. They use mana pots.<br />
<br />
Difference is if the fight is short enough, a mage can use destro pots. A warlock never will, unless it's like shade of akama and only lasts 1 minute (pretty bad example since that's almost the easiest fight in the game after T4).<br />

I can understand not caring about AE damage if you spend most of you time in PvP, but why would you not want to do AE damage in PvE? People wipe on trash all the time. Even if trash is trivial for you, clearing it faster just means more boss attempts. And even on the bosses, it's getting rare these days to have an encounter that's just a boss without some kind of minions or adds.<br />
<br />
Maybe you're just saying that the AE isn't important enough to go super deep in Marks? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/3/10539073697-serious-question-why-use-multishot.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
I found this part particularly interesting. The trouble isn't that it's not worth going deep marks for AE, it's that even deep marks hunters don't have enough AE for it to be worth considering for that reason. Talented multishot might be good, but it still only hits 3 targets and has a cooldown that prevents it from being spammed during a fight. That means it's used mostly as a single-target damage attack that happens to hit 2 others if any are around, not a useful AE ability. Anything you can AoE down with multishot was trivial anyway, even after you talent for it. Do warriors invest talent points in cleave so they'll get invited to groups for AE duty?<br />
<br />
Now if Volley got buffed until it did so much damage that people started using it for single-target fights, that'd make things much more interesting... But as it is, hunter AE is generally used only to help other classes kill large groups slightly faster, whether they're &quot;real&quot; AE classes using AE, or groups with no &quot;real&quot; AE spamming the closest thing they have. No hunter that's serious about their PvE will take talents to do slightly better AE, they'll be spending the points to improve performance in the situations where it will make a difference. They might spec deep marks anyway(depending on how balancing ends up), but they won't do it for the amazing AE.<br />
<br />
Unless they totally change all that when rebalancing for Wrath... :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes. Fury warriors are good AOE dps b/c of cleave, sweeping strikes, and whirlwind.<br />
<br />
Multishot doesn't have to be just for AOE groups, imagine a pull with multiple tanks. You could multishot 3 elites at once that are being tanked just fine. You just can't use it for good damage in 10+ mob pulls.</div></div><hr />

1) Blink and Ice Block taken off the GCD<br />
<br />
What the hell? Why do you need those off the GCD? No one else gets escape abilities off the GCD right now. Yes, Hunters are going to get their Disengage off the GCD (the ONLY ability they get not on GCD), but NONE of their oh shit abilities are as good as Blink or IB, and Hunters are the ONLY class WITHOUT a way to reduce GCD.<br />
<br />
Keep dreaming.</div></div><hr />

It already fucking is. Use Mage Armor. Spec Arcane Meditation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlocks don't use destro pots unless they literally have 2 shadow priests. They use mana pots.<br />
<br />
Difference is if the fight is short enough, a mage can use destro pots. A warlock never will, unless it's like shade of akama and only lasts 1 minute (pretty bad example since that's almost the easiest fight in the game after T4).<br />
<br />
respond anyway. grats on your successful troll!<br />

Sweeping Strikes is going back to the Arms tree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That only makes Spirit useful if you actually need additional mana regen. Every other caster has a stat or skill that converts Spirit into a DPS stat that is useful in all situations, whether you need additional mana regen or not.<br />
<br />
Now, Fire Mages have a mana dump of sorts in Living Bomb, so if the fight's long enough that using Mage Armor allows them to cast Living Bomb while using Molten Armor doesn't, then Spirit is useful to them -- but even so, Spirit isn't always useful to them the way it is for Warlocks, Druids, Shadow Priests. (Maybe Ele Shaman, not sure.)<br />
<br />
Frost Mages have no mana dump and are extremely efficient, so Spirit is pretty much never useful to them under any circumstances.</div></div><hr />
