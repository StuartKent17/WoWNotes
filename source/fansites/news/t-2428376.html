Yeah the way this has been implemented into the game really is a bit of a mess and I'm sure it could have been handled in a much easier to understand way, or maybe even a way that was more fun for both factions at the same time. Hopefully they are treating this first Warfront as an experiment and will improve on them for whatever comes next.</div></div><hr />

Horde had to wait 1 week to even have the world boss, alliance had all that already, horde gets the scenerio first. Now horde will have world boss starting on Tuesday, and the Alliance will have the scenerio on Sunday.<br />

It's kind of fun? But it's also really short, simple, easy, and can literally go bland on you after the second time doing em. <br />

See, the problem with your argument is that all of this requires time. And the time isn't even rewarding/worth it either. It's just a long wait for a VERY simplistic Scenario that you can't even LOSE!<br />

No one wants that.<br />

<br />
How else could you do it though?<br />
<br />
Blizzard wanted an effort made to initiate the event as opposed to a Wintergrasp like timer. But they also wanted the side gathering resources to have enough time to experience the actual attack.<br />
<br />
So how would you do it?<br />
<br />
You don't know how long it will take to gather the resources, and you want to give 7 days (it would seem) for the entire faction population to experience the content. How do you create a progress bar for that?<br />
<br />
What Blizzard HAVE screwed up on is the unclear explanation of how the the whole process works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with your arguement is the entirre false time gating argument..everything in this game and nearly every other game available has some sort of time gating, hell even things in life sometimes have time gating.<br />
<br />
Stop using time has a reason for something being bad. Just because you can't have it now, like you think it should be, does not make it bad.<br />
<br />
And no..I did not do a 180. The control of the zone is per week. We c an do the scenerio for a week, but yet we get the benefits of it starting Tuesday. I guess reading comprehension is not your forte?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HighlordJohnstone</div><div class="date">2018-09-09, 06:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would've made it a daily process. Or something similar towards the Mage Tower. <br />
<br />
For example: Share contributions for each Faction. Make Warfronts their own thing without having to actually show case who actually controls the Zone in game (uninstanced), so that everyone else could just battle it out and shit. Or, if ya do attempt that process, give the Alliance a chance to conquer a base or two throughout the Zone so that they too can do their own Warfront, and so forth. Make it a back and forth assault, and shit. So that there would be NO time gating, a total back and forth on Warfronts, as well as a total attempt to have fun with your friends while slaying the enemy faction. Though, I wouldn't change the uninstanced world.<br />
<br />
Or, make the Alliance wait 24 Hours so that the Warfronts could be a daily switch. For example: The Horde controls Stromgarde for a day. Then the Alliance takes a hold of Stromgarde for a day. Back and forth, daily. This is more likely.<br />
<br />
I'm shocked that Blizz forgot about these options. Cause, BOTH OF THESE ARE DOABLE! But, nope, small indie company, am I right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Everything in this game has time gating&quot;<br />
<br />
Yet I can still get the full package without having to wait for the full package each week, or some shit like that. The reason why Raids/Dungeons are time gated is because you could really only do em once every week. But, ya still got the full package. The Mage Tower was the same thing, giving people a monthly chance to do the Tower on BOTH ends of the stick. Here, this is not only a wait, but each Faction feels left out, and unchallenged, leaving a...well...incomplete taste in your mouth. Like the Package was full at one moment, but also got dismantled and destroyed midway through the trip when you realized that it fell from the delivery truck with the top part of the Box being open and unsealed throughout this entire time. <br />
<br />
Not to mention the fact that all of this wasn't tested. Like, not even once. Only the scenarios were tested.</div></div><hr />

I was a little confused my self when the progress bar hit 100% and nothing happened, not sure what they could have done specifically. <br />
<br />
Maybe some kind of stealth/sabotage missions? Or maybe a mission or event to evacuate your forces and prepare them for a counter attack? <br />
<br />
More or less anything would be better than nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Phase 1: Faction 1 has access to scenario (once per character), controls zone, has access to world boss<br />
Faction 2 has access to lucrative resource for azerite turn ins<br />
<br />
Phase 2: Faction 2 has access to scenario (once per character), controls zone, has access to world boss<br />
Faction 1 has access to lucrative resource for azerite turn ins<br />
<br />
Both factions have access to rares in the zone in each phase.<br />
Phases switch every week like all content has reset for close to 14 years now. There is no need for progress bars and algorithms to account for faction imbalance.<br />
Upon introduction of a second warfront, activate it with phases reversed so both factions have access to the full cycle every week.</div></div><hr />

Blizz making it take longer for the players to complete / grind things so that they dont get &quot;bored&quot; and can stay subscribed for longer.<br />

The warfronts feature is a terrible both story wise and design wise. And how it started today and broke multiple other things will be remembered until they kill it off for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

You mean the world boss that doesn't give guaranteed loot? Yeah enjoy that. <br />

You are delusional if you think horde getting a guaranteed 370 + item isn't going to effect world firsts or the race in general. <br />

<br />
Play Zandalari Trolls and Kul Tiran Humans! (but only after a long rep grind and when we implement them 6 months after expansion release)<br />
Play in Epic Warfronts (there's actually nothing epic in it, the way it works doesnt make sense story wise, and design wise its even shittier. But EPIC!)<br />
Enjoy Islands Expeditions with endless random maps (and shit rewards and repetetiveness on a new level)<br />
<br />
... umm actually I cant think of anything else. They took some great things from Legion and pruned them to laughable levels (mission table, war campaign) or implemented ideas, mostly good ideas but with terrible execution.<br />
<br />

<br />
Horde had to wait 1 week to even have the world boss, alliance had all that already, horde gets the scenerio first. Now horde will have world boss starting on Tuesday, and the Alliance will have the scenerio on Sunday.<br />
<br />
You people amaze me sometimes with your whining before you even think things through.<br />
<br />
Well correct me if i'm wrong, but has there ever been content that was unavailable for one faction for one week, cause i don't really remember it? And i don't mean things that you can contribute to to make it faster, i mean literally impossible to access for a week.</div></div><hr />

Please stop queuing for it then, because there's ACTUALLY THINGS TO DO, and you are making it harder for the people who are doing the required work. Seriously.

its still bugged cause we win and there is no portal to Arathi and our base is destroyed and there is only OUR war machine look like aliance still have warfront xD WTF<br />

Okay that was a bad way to phrase it. I didn't mean to say I was literally doing nothing; I was running around collecting things, building demolishers, repairing demolishers, all that. It just FELT like doing nothing because none of it was challenging or engaging in any way. 10 minutes collecting lumber and iron, fighting mobs that keel over with a sneeze even while solo? Zerging some random elite that is never a threat to anyone? Nothing I did in there felt like fun gameplay, and the only thought in my head at all times was oh gods please let this end already. I had serious flashbacks to how MoP scenarios went down.<br />
<br />
And to be fair, the whole thing DID end pretty quickly, I don't think it took even 20 minutes to win. But it still wasn't fun, and it still was a far, far, FAR cry from being a core expansion feature. It's a bit of a bigger WQ that you do once a week, and little more.</div></div><hr />

This expansion is slowly turning into one of the worst I've had the displeasure of playing for many, many years. I'd even rate wod higher because at least it had the garrison.

Stop using time has a reason for something being bad. Just because you can't have it now, like you think it should be, does not make it bad.<br />

And no..I did not do a 180. The control of the zone is per week. We c an do the scenerio for a week, but yet we get the benefits of it starting Tuesday. I guess reading comprehension is not your forte?<br />
<br />
No, we waited 7 days for that timer...only to be met with another timer of 7 days. We don't even get to start until next week...when we have already waited a week for them to gather resources...only to find out that we have to wait another week before we can even start that. Which means warfronts is bi-weekly, and from I am hearing...it isn't even worth that...and can reward pvp azerite gear that the Horde seem to disagree with. So bad system that is EXTREMELY TIME GATED with shitty rewards. And like the islands...gets stale VERY quickly. This and island and azerite....are lack-luster...or flat out bad.</div></div><hr />

You get a guaranteed piece of 370 loot. MOST people in fact the VAST MAJORITY of people that got to kill those bosses got nothing more then a green azerite shard for &quot;loot&quot;. So most of us got nothing. Only to find out that a big feature of this xpac...is lame...underwhelming...and on a 2 week time gate. Boring. Azerite traits are also lack-luster and boring. They don't even matter it seems. Its like...what was even the point? Give us Tier back...Tier was meaningful...azerite is just a big main stat stick piece of gear with no secondaries, but with some crap traits on it that doesn't even matter or is underwhelming at best.</div></div><hr />

well one mythic usually takes like 20-30 minutes as well, and some times you wont even get an item from that, at least warfront is guaranteed item, plus you can run them at any ilvl and dont need to reach 330+ to even get invited for mythic groups in the first place. So far I have gotten 5 different items in 5 runs, so you probably had extremly bad rng, which can happen in mythics as well</div></div><hr />

It may drop something, I insiste on the &quot;may&quot;, just like the rare mob, they may drop 340 ilvl items.<br />

&gt; Week 1: my faction have the zone and I have a handful of quest (non repeatable until next time we got the zone)<br />
&gt; Week 2: my faction don't have the zone and I have a handful of gold sink quests to retake it.<br />
<br />
No, instead it's :<br />
&gt; Week 1: my faction have the zone and I have a handful of non weekly quest (non repeatable until next time we got the zone)<br />
&gt; Week 2: the enemy faction is attacking and I GOT NOTHING TO DO FOR THE WHOLE WEEK.<br />
&gt; Week 3: my faction have the zone and I have a handful of gold sink quests (non repeatable until next time we got the zone)<br />
&gt; Week 4: my faction is attacking for a week<br />
<br />
Or am I missing something?<br />
Please, tell me I'm missing something here!<br />
The faction that is &quot;under attack&quot; is REALLY supposed to have NOTHING TO DO for a whole week?<br />
<br />
HOT DAMN warfront are lame! Because let's be frank:<br />
Week 1 is pretty much 45min of quest in a shiny new revamped zone.<br />
Week 2 is NOTHING.<br />
Week 3 is a couple of gold sink quests.<br />
Week 4 is an EXTREMELY unchallengeable scenario in the new revamped zone.<br />
<br />
And that's it?! Really?!<br />
<br />
Why the hell that revamped zone is so underused? Why the controlling faction don't have daily here?<br />
Why in A WARFRONT between the two faction there's NO pvp at all?<br />
Why didn't they just slap a couple of towers to create so sort of constant openworld battleground?<br />
<br />
They could have added a new reputation in these warfront, with their own daily (or wq, whatever) and that you could increase your reputation toward by doing some pvp in the zone?!<br />
<br />
WHY IS THAT THING SO EMPTY OF CONTENT AND SO LAME?!<br />
WHAT THE FUCK BLIZZARD?!<br />
<br />
Edit : Thinking about it, that stuff could have been improved A LOT by simply making it a 2 weak rotation like we thought it would be at first, but with the simple tweek being that once you faction has finish to gather resources, you just have to do the warfront scenario once to &quot;unlock&quot; the controlled state of the zone for you character (thus accessing the weekly quest and the world boss on the zone).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not even a 370 item. <br />
<br />
It's before the Mythic raiding opening. The horde also had an advantage in azerite farm (+ 500 azertie per war effort quest ), plus another 370 chance on the world boss, + potential 340 on rare. Alliance just get a chance for a 370 loot and a chance for 340 loot. <br />
<br />
this put one faction at a clear disadvantage, because you'll have an horde guild with potentially, and at least two 370 ( minimum non titanforged) items on each of their members, which can potentially give them a huge advantage in the race for &quot; world first &quot; <br />

Which means warfronts is bi-weekly, and from I am hearing...it isn't even worth that...and can reward pvp azerite gear that the Horde seem to disagree with. So bad system that is EXTREMELY TIME GATED with shitty rewards. And like the islands...gets stale VERY quickly. This and island and azerite....are lack-luster...or flat out bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
The most shittiest feedback system Blizzard ever introduced:<br />
- Alliance got a timer for the 0-100% Warfront Contribution of the Horde Faction. Below: A Greyed out &quot;Join the Queue/Scenario&quot;. Quests tell you to come back later.<br />
- Horde reaches 100% -&gt; Contribution bar is replaced by a 6days 24 hours bar... Below: A Greyed out &quot;Join the Queue/Scenario&quot;.<br />
- Coming up next week -&gt; 3RD Warfront Contribution Bar starts at 0%, this one actually the first for the alliance... Bwlow: A Greyed out &quot;Join the Queue/Scenario&quot;. <br />

You can run it as much as you want while it is up and get a 340 every time on top of the quest for a 370. <br />
<br />
That said, there are 4 phases to the Warfront process (Alliance control/Horde gathering -&gt; Horde assault -&gt; Horde control/Alliance gathering -&gt; Alliance assault), that each take roughly a week, and one single faction can only queue for the instance during one week. So you can access the actual Warfront every 1 in 4 week, give or take a few days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But..you can do it how many times you want now....don't need to wait all that. From what i remember, everytime we'll be able to do it, we will get the 370 quest, so it would be bad being able to get 1 every week. They'll probably change warfronts once alliance have their time too. I mean, i was wishing it was faster but after seeing what we get, i'm ok with the timer. It's something you do to help catch up, that's it. I'll have 2 new 120 by the end of the weekend, i wish we had warfronts up still or that i could lvl up faster, but since i don't have much time on the week to play =\.<br />
<br />
If you can do all mythics, some mythic +, some pvp (lol who does that still), raid N-H-Mythic, farm mats, farm rep, the weekly island expedition quest and would do warfronts weekly...even in 1 character. Man you have a lot of time in your hands. Now, if you are like me and don't do all that stuff, than is not a problem that we have nothing to do, it's a problem that we have nothing we want to do, to do. This last part goes to everyone, not to you in specific ^^.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was under the impression that the Defending Faction would get a Scenario that was basically defending their territory against the opposing faction NPCs with the Island Expedition faction NPCs to do the gathering and assaulting portion of what the players for the attacking side do in their scenario, and in a Sylvanas esque fashion (minus the blight bomb) order a retreat after a certain amount of time or certain objectives were carried out, not this literally lazy, half assed &quot;you get to sit around for another 7 days jacking off killing once per week rares that the opposing faction can kill too, and pray to the RNG gods for a chance at 370 loot from the world boss, all the while the opposing faction sacks your stronghold.&quot;<br />
<br />
I loved the ideas of War Fronts, but the execution could NOT be poorer save for linking them to the mission table some-how, dear lord how much more awful would they be if war contributions were actually linked to your mission table..<br />

I'm pretty sure even with poor secondary statted gear, a 15+ ilevel upgrade is an upgrade for every class/spec excluding trinkets and best azerite trait gear..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">randomcast</div><div class="date">2018-09-10, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the best way to fix this would be to have 2 war front zones at the same time one in the old kingdom and the other in kalimdor. Each faction would have control over 1 and you can keep the bi-weekly format where each faction contributed to the other zone to unlock that zones scenario to assault. Once done they switch (like it will do now). They should also add in that you can lose if your team doesn't preform well but not so that a few people will completely make it a pain (you really have to try hard to lose in order to lose). This will also allow you to set up harder difficulties to queue for so you can head in with a group. This can also allow them to add more War front zones later in the old world areas (with some that are not active) to show that the war is spreading to other areas.</div></div><hr />

If I get a bunch of gear from Warfronts that have Mastery as it's biggest stat on it, with no versatility, it is definitely not an upgrade for me. Heck, the 320 legs that I have actually had more crit, which is my number one secondary stat, than the warforged 345 legs that I got from the Warfront. My 320 legs also had Versatility as it's highest stat. The 345 ones had a ton of mastery which I do not need at all. Versatility is my number two secondary stat. Haste and Mastery are dead last together. In fact most guides say to basically almost ignore Mastery and Haste. So no, a 15+ item level isn't always an upgrade. It's scrap fodder.</div></div><hr />

So what you are telling me is that the PRIMARY stat increase on your leg upgrade is less valuable than your SECONDARY stat increase? I call BS. Now, if it was a ring where the secondary stats were crap, so the primary stat increase of stamina was the only thing that was worth anything, I could see your point and understand your frustration. But a straight up ilvl increase on any item other than rings(and maybe some trinkets) should have a big enough Primary Stat(Strength, Agility, Intellect) that a loss in secondary stats would not offset that gain.</div></div><hr />

No worries, mate. Sorry if the tone implied I was being a dick about it. I had the same reaction when I hit 120 and kept getting bad rolls on secondaries, and complained about it in guild, where I was promptly set straight about the Primary stat &gt; Secondary stats.

I'm not talking about myself personally, but those actually vying for the top spots - do keep in mind that a 20-30 item level upgrade on each raider bumps up the group average by 1-2 item levels, which ultimately will definitely have an impact at the top end. It's not uncommon for those guilds to get a bunch of 1-2% wipes that could quite literally have been kills if they'd had a tiny more oompfh.<br />
<br />
As for regular raiding with the &quot;lesser&quot; guilds, it has an even larger impact as they most likely haven't been going at it even remotely as hard, a 370 for everyone in a group is like 3-5 bosses worth of loot.<br />
<br />
And ofc even more so for the casuals still in normal uldir.<br />
<br />
Those pieces have a huge impact on the playerbase whether one wants to admit it or not.</div></div><hr />

From my experience there's a few bold afk'ers each battle and many running around gathering ressources as if you don't get iron trickling in to collect in the chest or more than 3 demolishers is possible. Usually followed with something about wanting to ride the kodo even though one guy with it is enough. Running with the npcs/buffs and together is far more beneficial to just capture the points and keep them bottlenecked till ressources are in and demos are out. One battle I spent 5mins on the fireboss because too many split up or faffed around in the mine next door.</div></div><hr />

I am well aware you can spam, these. However, 30 minutes for a random 340 piece is not a good time investment, especially when most competitive players are beyond 340 in every slot. It was worth doing once for the 370 piece, that's it. I personally am 350+ in every slot except my Azerite chest (340), which can't titan forge. Most in my guild are the same way. IF you raid and do M+, doing the Warfront more than once is a waste of time. <br />
<br />
&quot;It trivializes content below raiding?&quot; By giving a reward equal to Emissary rewards and Mythic 0 dungeons that we had access too since day 2 of the expansion? You are much better off spamming M+5's for 355 gear, takes the same or less time each run. <br />
