PCGamer Interview - Battle for Azeroth's Prepatch Story and Bugs<br />
PCGamer (https://www.pcgamer.com/wows-game-director-responds-to-battle-for-azeroths-elf-genocide-drama-and-rocky-pre-patch/) interviewed Ion Hazzikostas and John Hight on the prepatch drama that has happened recently both in terms of the reaction to the story and the bugs.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/oldsoldierinterview.jpg (https://www.pcgamer.com/wows-game-director-responds-to-battle-for-azeroths-elf-genocide-drama-and-rocky-pre-patch/) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The team anticipated that the prepatch events would be pretty controversial.<br />
Ion loves the Warbringer Jaina short.<br />
Pragmatic ruthlessness and honor/justic are both encapsulated within the question &quot;what is the Horde?&quot;<br />
The team had a lot of anticipation to release Old Soldier after the reactions from Warbringer Sylvanas.<br />
The story of Battle for Azeroth will continue to be expanded on both inside and outside of the game and the pacing should keep people happy and engaged the whole expansion.<br />
Ion thinks the major reactions to what Sylvanas did is that of questioning if her decisions define the Horde as a whole. Old Soldier is supposed to show that this is not the case.<br />
The reactions of the community is expected and understandable. Ion mentions the internet's reactions to the Red Wedding during Game of Thrones and how emotions run high when something you love is torn down.<br />
You can't alienate people and never let them back in, but a good story should have ups and downs that compliment each other.<br />
A fun part of WoW is that the story is episodic. If it seems like they are doing something blatantly obvious and repeating past stories, people should stay tuned because they are setting you up for a surprise.<br />
The internet can be a giant game of telephone. During the Blizzcon announcement, the question of Teldrassil was who attacked first, Alliance or Horde? It was to build anticipation until Alpha when the timeline of the events was pretty straightforward.<br />
People want to look for an explanation for events that make them uncomfortable, but sometimes storytelling is just that.<br />
If the team had their way, none of the story would be revealed before an expansion, but the benefits of a beta outweigh keeping the entire story a surprise.<br />
Blizzard tries to keep major story points hidden until they are experienced in the live game. This is mostly done by excluding major cutscenes from testing periods.<br />
There is a lot of stuff that the players will see for the very first time in just a few days; some really big story beats that they can't wait to share.<br />
Any time the screen goes black and nothing happens during the beta, this is an indication that there is a missing piece not available to decrypt yet.<br />
The team likes to use the prepatches now to set up the story and bridge the gaps between expansions.<br />
Prepatches are previews to something that is a part of the expansion while also having a fleeting &quot;you have to be there to experience it&quot; piece.<br />
The goal is to make each prepatch deeper and more memorable and act as a rallying cry to come re experience this world. <br />
The team wants this prepatch to be something that is reflected upon with nostalgia years down the road.<br />
This time around, the team went back and set up a scaling method that could be done coherently instead of the Warlords one in which each spell was manually readjusted. Applying this massive infrastructure change to 14 years of data came with some unexpected bugs.<br />
A lot of these bugs were caught during the PTR and beta phase, but it isn't until the live game that you can catch a lot of content that most players test on the PTR.<br />
Ion says the game is pretty stable at this point and most of the early prepatch issues have been solved.<br />
The fix involved hand tuning a lot of values. This wasn't a code bug but involved a lot of math. The team had underestimated the impact the absence of artifact weapons would have.<br />
They wanted to understand understand the underlying issue instead of just blindly fixing them.<br />
The 60-80 leveling range was sped up because the team agreed this was a range of leveling that was taking longer than intended. They were aware of it in 7.3.5.<br />
They are tracking the launch of Battle for Azeroth to go well. With the new sharding technology and beta testing, they anticipate the launch to go smoothly even with a global launch.<br />
The team is happy with the speed that they corrected the prepatch issues even though they know this doesn't excuse having them in the first place. A 14 old game that is this complex is bound to have some issues, however.<br />
The expansion launch is just the flick of a switch because prepatch puts all the data into the player's computer beforehand.<br />
The work that the team has done in the past few weeks is to assure that Monday and Tuesday go as smooth as possible.<br />
<br />

Mail Esports Interview on Wow's Maturing Storyline<br />
Mail Esports (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/esports/article-6043667/With-Battle-Azeroth-World-Warcraft-mature.html) interviews Gary Platner and Terran Gregory on WoW's evolving story.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/mailesportsinterview.jpg (http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/esports/article-6043667/With-Battle-Azeroth-World-Warcraft-mature.html) <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Landmark storytelling games were not out yet when WoW launched in 2004.<br />
World of Warcraft storytelling inspirations are much different now than in the past.<br />
Vanilla storytelling was much more of a hyperbolic fantasy, comic book-esque story. This is what people gravitated towards during that time.<br />
Nowadays, audience sensibilities have gravitated to a more thoughtful, compelling narrative. Blizzard has followed suit and is starting to tell more stories like this in WoW.<br />
WoW is still finding new players all the time. Some of them weren't even alive when the game was released.<br />
Gregory sees some of the younger generation embracing WoW on Twitch and loves it.<br />
The WoW demographic also showcases a lot of parents and older generations.<br />
The storytelling has matured with the audience.<br />
Much like successful daytime soap opera, Wow has adopted the practice that for every character that goes out, one gets weaved in, but you can't do them all at the same time. <br />
Garrosh Hellscream was the first example of a character that saw a full ark through expansions. Community engagement shifts these narratives as well.<br />
Every quest in the game has a unique name, and it's sometimes a monumental task to think of a new name for a quest nowadays that isn't taken already.<br />
The team decided to go with the story of Battle for Azeroth because they wanted something a little more personal and emotional after Legion.<br />
The team wants to focus on the people involved in the war and progressing them as characters.<br />
Old Soldier was the first high-fidelity CGI cinematic released outside of being an expansion introduction. They had an opportunity to make a second and it seemed right to do so. <br />
The team knew that Old Soldier would connect well because a lot of players would be feeling like Saurfang at this point.<br />
The passion people have for Wow is what has kept it popular all of these years, and it's this passion that will keep it going for many years to come.<br />

Riot - Ghostcrawler Moves to Head of Creative Development<br />
Ghostcrawler has moved (https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/54ABrPUY-ghostcrawler-lane-swap-queue-dodge-whatever) from being Lead Designer on League of Legends to Head of Creative Development at Riot. They are continuing to work on other games.<br />
<br />
In an interview with Variety (https://variety.com/2018/gaming/features/riot-games-next-game-league-of-legends-1202892072/) Riot Games co-founder Marc Merrill asked what the future of MMOs looked like. &quot;I think we have a view, others have a view, players have a view. World of Warcraft continues to be a dominating game. There is a really good argument that going head-to-head with ‘WoW’ may not be the best move, but who knows. We’re exploring a lot of stuff, thinking about a lot of stuff.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hello friends,<br />
I wanted to let you all know that I moved off the League of Legends team a few weeks ago to take on an expanded role. I am still very much at Riot, but I am no longer the lead designer on League. The new lead designer is Andrei “Meddler” Van Roon.<br />
<br />
My new position at Riot is head of creative development. We don’t typically make a big deal about titles at Riot, however, I plan on still keeping up an active conversation with you all, so I wanted to explain a little bit about what this role means so you’ll have some insight into the kinds of topics I’ll be most effective at discussing. <br />
<br />
We’ve been up front that we want to put the S in Riot Games, and I am helping with that effort. In addition, we have been taking Runeterra as a world more seriously, as you’ve probably realized with the release of the Ryze CG and the world map. While telling stories is really important to us (and I hope many of you), there is a limit to the kinds of stories we can tell in League of Legends without getting in the way of a competitive, multiplayer game. So, many of our stories will have to come through other mediums, and of course that possibly includes other games.<br />
<br />
I look forward to all of the “GC was kicked upstairs where he can’t do much harm to LoL” memes. Let me know if I can help you with those in any way.<br />
<br />
League of Legends is in great hands, arguably even better hands. I know it’s hard sometimes as players to have a full appreciation for how many people collaborate to make League happen. League development is very much a team effort (a large team effort), and it’s almost impossible to detect the influence of any single contributor, even a lead designer. The direction for League comes from a leadership team, to which Meddler is a great addition. He has been working on League longer than I have, and he knows all of the nuance, weird rules, and “tribal knowledge” of League design better than I do. He has a long memory of things we tried and why they worked or didn’t. He knows where the bodies are buried. I’ll also still be Meddler’s boss, so if he disappoints you, just let me know and I’ll take care of things. In all seriousness, I wouldn’t be able to step away if the design team on League wasn’t so strong.<br />
<br />
I’ll still be out there playing the game with you, and I promised the development team that I’d always let them know what I think, by posting on Reddit of course. I’ll keep an eye on Boards as well (and more attention to the lore Boards now), but the easiest way to reach me is probably on Twitter at Ghostcrawler (https://twitter.com/ghostcrawler).<br />
<br />
In keeping with my reputation of buffing frost mages, Meddler promised to take good care of Lissandra.<br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Timeless Isle Vendors<br />
The Timeless Isle was an addition in Patch 5.4, and brought some new end-game content. The vendors in this zone accept Timeless Coin as currency, and after a few iterations some cool items were added. The Reins of the Heavenly Golden Cloud Serpent mount is still purchasable for 100,000 Timeless Coins. Also, the Censer of Eternal Glory can be used to collect the secondary PvP currency.<br />

<br />
The Burdens of Shaohao<br />
This five part series tells the story of Emperor Shaohao, and sets the story of the Mists of Pandaria. After the emperor fights doubt, despair, fear, and anger, he recognizes that his people have succumbed to the same emotions. The emperor must make a sacrifice for the good of his people, if he wants them to survive the sundering.<br />

<br />
World of Warcraft 10th Anniversary<br />
In preparation to the 10th anniversary of World of Warcraft, there was a blue post revealing some of the content players will get to experience. Molten Core, Tarren Mill and Southshore PvP are iconic Vanilla experiences. To remember some of the earliest parts of the game, these would make a return in the form of a 40-player Raid Finder for Molten Core, and a Tarren Mill vs. Southshore battleground<br />

<br />
Legion Confirmed<br />
World of Warcraft: Legion was unveiled at Gamescom in 2015. The cinematic teaser showed Gul’dan in the Tomb of Sargeras, releasing a foe we have not faced in a long time. During the event some of the major additions of the expansion were also revealed. A new Hero Class, the new continent, artifact weapons, and order halls. Some of the key allies and villains were also mentioned.<br />
<br />

<br />
Infernal Mounts<br />
The Infernal Mounts model was added to the game files in 2016. Two of these color variants were used in Legion as rewards from Nighthold Heroic and Mythic. The Frostshard Infernal was added in the Battle for Azeroth Pre-Patch as a reward for the No Stable Big Enough achievement. The Coldflame and Flarecore Infernal recolors have not been used yet, and could potentially be used in the future.<br />

<br />
Demon Hunter<br />
The new Hero Class announced at Gamescom was the Demon Hunter. This new class would have two specializations, Havoc and Vengeance. This is the only class in the game with only two specializations, with one being DPS and the other tank.<br />

The Red Wedding was completely in line with Tywins motivations and what we knew of the character. Attacking and burning teldrassil was completely out of character for half the races present there. Like the tauren druids having a massive bloodthirst for malfurion? Come on. <br />
<br />
Also &quot;we've now started making thoughtful narratives because thats what people want these days.&quot; lets ignore the fact that people who enjoy those things didnt suddenly pop into existence overnight, why do these feel like some of the storylines with the least thought put into them in recent memory. Characters drive story, what you want to happen real bad shouldn't dictate character actions because it devalues any development you attempt. On one hand you tell us sylvanas loves her people and would do anything to protect them then on the other you have her gunning down half of them for daring to show up to event she herself put her blessing behind. Now sylvanas is worthless as a character, sure we can't predict what shes going to do but thats because you've shown anything shes done in the past has no development on the character as she stands today. Next week she might retire and open a bakery and sell tiger loafs to the golden lotus. Shes never expressed a desire to do that before but she also never expressed a desire to gun down her own people for doing something she told them to do but here we are.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not gonna adress the hole comment but what i am going to do is use this as an example .<br />
Please research things before you speak and say stuff , since Horde druids were sent to Silithus to help heal the dmg that Sargeras made with his sword. Since Sylvanas knew they wouldnt be ok with her plans. Thats why they all met at the crossroads and only Saurfang and Nathanos knew about her plans.</div></div><hr />

Druids killing other druids because of factions differences really does not make any sense. There is a quest for horde druids to kill aquatic druids that are trying to destroy sinking azurite barrels.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, that was my biggest issue with the questline on the horde side since I first did it on a druid. I understand it's not really practical to have a separate quest chain for one class but it still didn't feel right at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly how I feel too. I don't care about the burning of Teldrasil, that is war, but druids would never participate in this kind of war. A lot of thing does not make sense especially after Legion invasion, heroes (of same class) cast away differences and work together, now suddenly they kill each other. They even swear their allegiance to their class leader already.<br />

Well they kind of failed there. <br />
<br />
It's a perfectly serviceable pre-patch, it fills in the gaps from Legion to BfA, but it's note exactly memorable. In all honesty the only two pre-patches I can really recall is WotLKs, which was wonderful with the zombie mechanic (at least until people QQd because they couldn't check the AH) and the plagueland grind, and the Legion pre patch, which was incredible fun tearing across the landscape to kill demons in the invasions.<br />

I can vaguely recall Cata, as it had some elemental invasions in cities, but I can't clearly recall MoPs or WoD's. BfA's will be joining the latter.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, no serious druid would do that, nor would they allow Sylvanas to try and kill Malfurion. <br />

You know what's even worse than that: The nelf captain, Delaryn Summermoon, who was killed at the burning of Teldrassil is giving out world quests after that... Really?

It's using the opponents emotion to weaken their strategy. Syl baited them into a huge trap in Undercity. The Alliance was blinded by vengeance and they spent tons of resources attacking a useless target of no strategic value. Remember it takes significantly more manpower to attack a fortified position than to defend. To top it off most of the force was gassed and it was a huge loss of life. Some horde were sacrificed, but the Alliance took a major blow.<br />
<br />
That's pragmatism in my book.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The events themselves impact on the story sure. But how those events translate into player experience isn't really that involving. A short questchain and some entirely forgettable world quests. The scenario is decent, but so short lived I don't think it's going to stick with me like the legion invasions will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
....excuse me, what? <br />
<br />
This isn't just wrong - it's absurdly wrong. Unless of course, by &quot;landmark storytelling games&quot; you mean the 'walkie-talkie cinematic experience' style of games that have come into vogue amongst AAA developers of late. The Last of Us didn't invent mature storytelling, guys. Games with good stories have been around for decades - many of them being amongst the vaunted all-time classics of the medium.<br />
<br />
Come to think of it, a lot of that article is questionable. &quot;Blizzard has always been known for its storytelling&quot;. Once upon a time, maybe. At this point in time, though, it's been the biggest chink in their armor for years.</div></div><hr />

Seems pretty plausible to me.<br />
<br />
Except that we literally just finished with an expansion where Blizzard made a huge stink about class identity over faction or race identity (class-segregated order halls, but little to no factional division except the historical little piece of Dal allocated to each). Malfurion has been a central piece of the druid order hall campaign all expansion, and in fact is the one that personally welcomes you to the Dreamgrove right before you select your first questing zone in Legion. This is literally the same as if the shamans, after all expansion, were just totally cool with Anduin (or Sylvanas) murdering Thrall right in front of them, or mages being cool with either one murdering Khadgar in front of them. It's absolutely insane to think that the class order would take that sitting down.<br />
<br />
Like, ok, if Malfurion had burned down a capital city or something, then I could see horde druids (and hell, probably even alliance ones) turning on him. But Malfurion was just defending his people, and was doing it in a surprisingly restrained way (wisp wall instead of, say, wisp detonation ala Archimonde). And it's not like Sylvanas sprung this on us. Before we even set foot in Darkshore, she told us point blank that her intention was to kill Malfurion. Why in the hell were druids forced to go along with this? Hell, why were any of us, but especially druids.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think he meant that it was shocking like the red wedding, because noone expected it to happen.<br />
<br />
The only problem is: they announced it way too early.<br />
I never read spoilers, but somehow it was impossible not to know about this.<br />
So it was sadly not shocking while playing..<br />
<br />
This is the issue. Comparing it to the Red Wedding is ludicrous. Like, this is more analogous to if they'd announced the Red Wedding ahead of time, and who all would die, but were like &quot;but it's not who you think! Just wait and see&quot; when everyone was like &quot;uh, ya, Wrey and Bolton kinda hate them&quot;. And then when shit goes down exactly as expected, and people get indignant, they try to lay some line about having respect for creators because &quot;they're giving it their all&quot;.<br />
<br />
Like, I don't have an issue with any of the creators personally. I just have immense issue with their storytelling, their pre-reveal dialogue, their hilarious &quot;it's morally grey!&quot; for an action that can legitimately be described as genocide-because-Sylvanas-threw-a-damn-temper-tantrum, and their attempts to characterize criticism of their storytelling and storyline as criticism of the creators themselves. That said, given the content of this recent quest chain, I do think that whichever creator or creators had dominant influence over how that storyline was written need to be shuffled into positions where they aren't as likely to cause something like this in the future. Like, I'm not saying fire them, but this is a perfectly valid strike to hold against the Creative Director, or whomever they decide ultimately screwed up here. Because this absolutely 110% was a complete blunder, both in terms of storytelling and in terms of PR.</div></div><hr />

He's decided what you're going to be nostalgic about, he loves to micromanage every aspect of the game, I'd bet his next move is to tell you how to move the mouse, so you can understand what it means to be the Horde better. <br />
<br />
&quot;We like to keep things under wraps&quot;. We totally hadn't noticed that. At all. <br />
<br />
I think I've cracked the code, though: if Blizzard makes a statement that includes &quot;What it means to be...&quot; - it's gonna suck. Hard. WoD could have been called &quot;World Of What It Means To Be&quot;. <br />
<br />
&quot;Nowadays, audience sensibilities have gravitated to a more thoughtful, compelling narrative. Blizzard has followed suit and is starting to tell more stories like this in WoW.&quot;<br />
<br />
Could've fooled me. Anyone want to point out where the &quot;thoughtful, compelling narrative&quot; is?</div></div><hr />

Wow's storytelling has always been great and suddenly thinking it's a joke because a character didn't act the way you headcanoned their actions? Give me a break.<br />

Yeah it's dumb. I know they don't want to just keep making the same prepatch over and over again with a different enemy, but WotLK and Legion pre-patches are historically the best and greatest and overwhelmingly positive experiences most every player has. Then they forget all of that and make lame pre-patch events like MoPs and WoDs</div></div><hr />

Well, for some desperately-lacking perspective: it's a fictional story many people have sunk literally thousands of dollars and literally a decade and a half of their life into. <br />
<br />
Blizzard literally wants their fanbase to be invested deeply in the material they produce. It's how they stay in business. So they can't a) produce something ridiculously shitty, and then b) be surprised or indignant when their customers hate its blatant inconsistency, thoughtlessness, and stupidity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also &quot;we've now started making thoughtful narratives because thats what people want these days.&quot; lets ignore the fact that people who enjoy those things didnt suddenly pop into existence overnight, why do these feel like some of the storylines with the least thought put into them in recent memory. Characters drive story, what you want to happen real bad shouldn't dictate character actions because it devalues any development you attempt. On one hand you tell us sylvanas loves her people and would do anything to protect them then on the other you have her gunning down half of them for daring to show up to event she herself put her blessing behind. Now sylvanas is worthless as a character, sure we can't predict what shes going to do but thats because you've shown anything shes done in the past has no development on the character as she stands today. Next week she might retire and open a bakery and sell tiger loafs to the golden lotus. Shes never expressed a desire to do that before but she also never expressed a desire to gun down her own people for doing something she told them to do but here we are.<br />
<br />
Well, first of all, Sylvanas has always been like that. Why has it come as a surprise for the most people? And secondly... who the f cares about GC and what's he's doing at Riot.</div></div><hr />

Appart from tauren and that's mostly their druids , horde is evil simple as that , the only thing that &quot;old soldier&quot; video showed was that some of the horde are like sylvannas kill and take land and don't care and some are like saurfang as in they do the same thing but with honor. &quot;Hey i'm gonna take your land but pick up your sword cos' i'm honorable like that&quot; completely ignoring the plundering and territory stealing.</div></div><hr />

Think you missed the global release announcement. BfA is releasing at the same time world-wide. They set it at midnight in CEST (Central European Summer Time, UTC+2). That means it releases at 6:00 PM EDT/3:00 PM PDT on Monday the 13th in the US, 6:00 AM CST (China Standard Time, not the US version of CST) on Tuesday in Shanghai, and 8:00 AM AEST (Australian Eastern Standard Time) on Tuesday in Sydney.<br />
<br />
So yes, the countdown timer is accurate, and in fact, for the first time represents the global release countdown.<br />

So your evidence of the Horde being worse than Alliance is because of two leaders who 99% of the fanbase hated and complained about being forced to follow? Uhh... Ok.. I guess using your logic Alliance is 100% evil because of Arthas.<br />
<br />
Singular villains can come from any faction, that doesn't define the faction as a whole though. If you want to know what the Horde are actually about you should try actually levelling one, or better yet play WC3 where the modern Horde was formed.</div></div><hr />

You do realise how many NPC's and things are in the game right? Are you really getting your panties in a twist over something so unimportant?<br />
<br />
<br />
Give me examples m8 .

<br />
You have the dark irons in the Alliance now, you know the guys the summoned fucking Ragnaros into the world.<br />
<br />
Allies enslaved Pandaren @ start of mop to build warcamp<br />
<br />
Jaina massacred innocent Belfs in Dalaran<br />
<br />
Goblin Intro - You fired upon a neutral vessel full of refugees and sank it<br />
<br />
Arthas was human - responsible for probably the most loss of life next to legion<br />
<br />
Nelfs are responsible for the original legion invasion, and partly to blame for the subsequent two<br />
<br />
Want me to go on? I'm not saying the horde hasn't done bad shit as well, just dont pretend your fucking alliance is a pristine force of goody goodys.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Luzahn</div><div class="date">2018-08-12, 04:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alliance is certainly better on average, I'd say. It wasn't that way until after Wrath, but ever since Garrosh its had a problem with aggression and a willingness to inflict civilian casualties. <br />
<br />
The Alliance's nastiness is more insidious, though. It doesn't get much coverage in the game itself, but there's an undercurrent of exclusion and mistrust at-odds with the positive veneer of the faction. Not quite evil, but a colonialist bent, a willingness to label people as savages or monsters.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Quaade</div><div class="date">2018-08-12, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's using the opponents emotion to weaken their strategy. Syl baited them into a huge trap in Undercity. The Alliance was blinded by vengeance and they spent tons of resources attacking a useless target of no strategic value. Remember it takes significantly more manpower to attack a fortified position than to defend. To top it off most of the force was gassed and it was a huge loss of life. Some horde were sacrificed, but the Alliance took a major blow.<br />
<br />
That's pragmatism in my book.<br />
<br />
Except no. The trap in UC was just in case she lost. <br />
<br />
That the master schemer was unable to include mages in her master scheme, makes her look nothing like a master schemer as her plan fall apart after the unexpected arrival of one. <br />
<br />
One whose reputation is that of an insanely good teleporter. If Sylvanaa is so to be clever and a master schemer, she should have known at that moment that her last attempt would fail. <br />
<br />
Instead she's shown as being quite pleased with herself untill she sees Andiun alive. <br />
<br />
As for her monological taunting. That behaviour right down to sitting on the throne is a mirror of how Blackwing in BWL acts and we tell him in other words that he's crazy. <br />
<br />
Again none of it is ruthless pragmatism. It's blind stupidity at a level where Sylvanas might as well be Old Man Smithers in a rubber mask.</div></div><hr />

So either have Sylvanas be a Lannister/Frey/Bolton, or don't have her do things that they would do then try to say &quot;but she's still morally grey, and isn't evil&quot;.</div></div><hr />
