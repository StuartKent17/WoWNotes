Tournament Q&amp;A<br />
A few more questions related to the tournament, you're getting used to it. <br />
After the qualifying at what point would we be traveling to compete?<br />
Traveling would occur at the live Regional Qualfier events. The top 4 teams from each qualifier round will be invited and flown out to the live regional qualifier event to compete for cash prizes and a chance to be invited to the 2008 World of Warcraft Global Invitational Arena Championships. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5784481569&amp;postId=57837448305&amp;sid=1#1))<br />
<br />
Will mods be used at these locations?<br />
Mods will not be allowed for the live events. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5784481569&amp;postId=57837448305&amp;sid=1#1))<br />
<br />
If we will not be traveling, will mods be allowed in the tournament at all? <br />
Mods that are allowed by the ToU and EULA are allowed for the onlish phase, but as stated above, they will not be allowed at the live events. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5784481569&amp;postId=57837448305&amp;sid=1#1))<br />
<br />
Can you make new teams?<br />
All teams are supposed to be locked down so I believe the ability to create teams is also disabled. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5813171576&amp;postId=57837448273&amp;sid=1#9))<br />

Wrath of the Lich King and money sinks<br />
According to Bornakk, Blizzard found tons of new ways to make you spend your gold in the expansion, however nothing says if it will be enough to stop the inflation created by the daily quests (especially since Patch 2.4)<br />
Well, there will be things that cost money in Wrath of the Lich King, we have no plans to remove currencies. <br />
<br />
Note: This has nothing to do with the purchase and/or process of allowing your flying mount to fly in Northrend.<br />

World of Warcraft Surpasses One Million Peak Concurrent Player Milestone in Mainland China<br />
Yes, that's one million players playing at the same time, see the press release (http://www.corp.the9.com/news/2008/news_080411.htm) below. <br />
<br />
Shanghai, China – April 11, 2008. The9 Limited (NASDAQ: NCTY) (“The9”), a leading online game operator in China, today announced that Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft, the subscription-based massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) has achieved a record peak concurrency of 1 million, the highest concurrency since the game's commercial launch in June 2005, following the launch of its new expansion pack, World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade, in mainland China on September 6, 2007. <br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade is the first expansion pack for the massively multiplayer online role-playing game developed by Blizzard Entertainment and operated by The9 in mainland China. In addition to continuing World of Warcraft's epic story line, Blizzard Entertainment's Burning Crusade expansion pack has extended the existing game content in a variety of ways, raising the original game to new heights. After the launch of the expansion pack, many existing players returned to the game and numerous new players have also been attracted to participate in the experience. It is no doubt that the epic game content and quality of Blizzard Entertainment's World of Warcraft: The Burning Crusade has once again written a new chapter in mainland China's online game history.<br />

heh, already noticed mats especially are taking a huge jump from inflation on our realm. if you're not after money for your epic flier for that n-th alt, i'd seriously be stockpiling other stuff. WotLK still a loooong ways off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm assuming this was a joke.<br />
<br />
If not...<br />
<br />
Many times these guilds have people take their kill shot photos in old school T3 gear to show how experienced they are in the past. I find it pretty cool actually if someone has full T3. Not may people got it and its one of the few RARE achievements still left in this game. When WotLK comes out I'm sure you'll see certain rogues take pictures with their warglaives out even if there are substantial upgrades. Its a really cool thing Imo, even though it has a mild leetness to it. /golfclap.<br />

<br />
<br />
&quot;For this kill we have three different points of view:<br />
<br />
Sbe - Restoration shaman<br />
Zkygge - Combat rogue<br />
Ekyo - Destruction Warlock&quot;<br />
<br />
So how do you know what a hunter did for 10 minutes during this fight?</div></div><hr />
