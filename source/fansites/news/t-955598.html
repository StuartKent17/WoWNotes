World first Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest by Siiz (US-Senjin / Premonition)<br />
Siiz (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/senjin/Siiz/advanced) from Premonition (http://premoguild.com/forums/portal.php) (US - Sen'jin) was the first player in the world to acquire Dragonwrath, Tarecgosa's Rest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71086/dragonwrath-tarecgosas-rest/)! Congratulations to him.<br />
<br />
And to answer the top 2 questions about the mount portion of the staff: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The mount has a 1.5 sec cast time just like any other mount.<br />
People can't ride on your back. <br />
The giant dragon in the 2nd screenshot isn't the mount, it's Tarecgosa during the end event of the questline.<br />

It's about the size as other drake mounts. The spectre of the huge dragon, though... it was so big, you could see it from outside the city gates.</div></div><hr />

Just keep the quest in your log and you can do it every day afaik... that's how I got it, did the quest 7 days in a row. I heard you can even choose shadow wardens while you do this so you don't miss any marks, but if you care about completion I imagine you don't need them very badly anyway.</div></div><hr />

Not true our ele shaman in my guild would have gotten world first he is only 2 boss drains away and we screwed up when we did the 4 quests not reailzing you could whipe before we had 1 shotted 2 bosses whell making it. So he lost 2 boss's of cinders which put him 2 boss's of drain behind. Long story short we didnt exploit and he is 2 bosses away so legitly if they did the 4 quests before killing bosses and had good droprate this was 100% legit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you keep &quot;Into the fire&quot; at completed and do not turn it in, and keep &quot;Fire from the Skies&quot; in your quest log as well. You can return every day to do the bombing run without having to do a single daily for Molten Front. This of course is for people who are done with the area and just need the achievement. I have one left to go, glad they made this change. Kept seeing the same elemental every day &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

We're not the best guild ever, but we got 3 mobs on farm now, in large part due to horrible participation cause of the damn summer hole, people going on vacation etc. Tried the other 2 a couple times but had to switch people too often to enable everyone to participate etc., everytime we see some progress new people get swapped in and have to relearn the fight. <br />
Or we do a 10man raid or 2, then suddenly get barely enough people to form a 25man several people may have never seen the fight before that at all, and 10man people have to adapt to 25man, more crystals, more people to mess up on Ryo's legs etc. At this point I'd count myself lucky to finish the Ember step of the questline by the end of August... -.- Goddammit...</div></div><hr />

More or less, since they fixed the &quot;save the daily&quot; trick. <br />
But its all the better isnt it? <br />
Although I dont think this should be prioritize than other more serious matter.<br />
<br />
Such as is the tagging issue on &quot;the fiery lords of sethria&quot; (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5861/the-fiery-lords-of-sethrias-roost/) fixed? <br />
Or do the npc from &quot;the protector of hyjal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/29128/the-protectors-of-hyjal/)&quot; still do aoes to the opposite faction npcs?<br />
<br />
<br />
I have no problem with everyone else having it, if they did the same as me. Making it 3 elementals is such a joke.<br />
But you do realise the &quot;save the daily&quot; method doesnt work anymore?<br />
Before it was 1 per everyday. Now its 3 per every 3 days.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
10man raids are way, way easier.<br />

Yea, if you have enough toons with epics to do a raid stack/optimum class composition.<br />
&quot;sorry leet mage, we need that death knight over there to grip adds&quot;<br />

Lol you must be bitter that you can't get it or something. Legendary items have gotten much better since then, it isn't just a &quot;oh lets hope it drops&quot; type deal.

well seeing as its 7th week of firelands atm.. you would need 18 bosses to get 25 embers with optimal luck meaning its 3rd week you can start with cinders.. now cinders take around 2 weeks and 4 bosses if you do it with 6/7 or 7/7 heroic so thats 4 weeks and 4 bosses gone past till you get to souls.. now as he doesnt have ragna downed at least untill this week.. its like he should have gathered 250 souls in 14 bosses and as 250 divided by 17 is 14.7 you cant have the staff by the 7th week without downing ragna or bugging the souls drain at least once..<br />

so basicly he cheated i guess, like did ur shammy unless you have ragna on heroic down before this week<br />

Flameward Hippogryph as &quot;world first&quot; only if you cheated your way trough the daily reset bug. Otherwise you're just &quot;world first&quot; as everyone in the world who started at day 1 (wich means, almost entire player base, lol).<br />

Just keep the quest in your log and you can do it every day afaik... that's how I got it, did the quest 7 days in a row. I heard you can even choose shadow wardens while you do this so you don't miss any marks, but if you care about completion I imagine you don't need them very badly anyway.<br />
<br />
I'm afraid it does not work like that anymore for a long time... used to do that only to loose the firehawk one day.<br />

If you keep &quot;Into the fire&quot; at completed and do not turn it in, and keep &quot;Fire from the Skies&quot; in your quest log as well. You can return every day to do the bombing run without having to do a single daily for Molten Front. This of course is for people who are done with the area and just need the achievement. I have one left to go, glad they made this change. Kept seeing the same elemental every day &gt;.&gt;<br />

At least for me, I couldn't start the next ones without turning in &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and completing the next 2 (gather the 5 herbs and kill 8 mobs). The firepeak npcs only offer the dailies after I turn in both.<br />
<br />
Way before the hotfix for the elementals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even bigger fail. You need 9 bosses but then you need Beth'tilac, Shannox, Rhyolith and Alysrazor again to start on cinders... hence it takes 2 weeks.. this is when you look at from day 1 from firelands started, hence 1 clear + baleroc + 1 of those 4 is needed to complete the first part of the quest, hence you cannot continue on the quest untill next reset when you get the 4th portal fragment and can summon the fire elemental</div></div><hr />

Well sort of correct, but you could still do it by starting to fly at 10 secs before the daily reset meaning you are on the quest all the time pretty much^^</div></div><hr />

Really? Was it that much of a problam so they had to fix it? Its not like there are thousands of things that needs to be balanced about druids that are more important to the gameplay. Right? Blizzard fails... again! GW2. Cant wait!</div></div><hr />

It doesn't. HC25 just gives more than double the amount of cinders than 10man normal. also 10heroic gives nowhere near as 25hc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nope none of the quests need HC modes, but its just faster by a lot if you do them hardmodes.. then again normal 25 is still faster than hc 10</div></div><hr />

It seems to be very random. I had it for a number of days in a row and logged in one day to not have the hawk up. I dropped the quest, completed &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and the subsequent quests. And for some reason I had the daily to get the egg that day. It also happened to be the day that Flashfire (the last one I needed) was up. Needless to say I was annoyed.<br />
<br />
The last few days I had the Firehawk up just fine. I don't know what causes it to randomly go away, but something does. In any case this morning Flashfire was one of the 3 so I'm finally down with those achievements. Now onto the RNG of the Scorchling pet. At least that one I can do once a day and now I don't need to worry about keeping certain dailies. In fact I'm going to skip the &quot;Into the Fire&quot; dailies entirely. I'm so sick of them.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure Blizzard took a look at how many people had all achievements BUT &quot;Death From Above&quot; and it was lower than they'd like. This allows there to still be some RNG but nowhere near as bad.</div></div><hr />

Unless tier 13 heroic gear has a way higher itemlevel difference to the actual tier (but Blizz already stated they want to keep it that way) i can't see how ~ 600 additional spellpower, ~ 150 additional intellect and ~ 100 additional secondary stats should bypass a procc responsible for 10% of your overall damage.</div></div><hr />

It's been working fine for me, the bird vanished after around a week my 1st time hanging on to it, and was up for 3 days (as of yesterday) the second time. Even if it doesn't last indefinitely it's still better than every other day. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
At least for me, I couldn't start the next ones without turning in &quot;Into the Fire&quot; and completing the next 2 (gather the 5 herbs and kill 8 mobs). The firepeak npcs only offer the dailies after I turn in both.<br />
<br />
If you hang on to the bombing quest you only have to complete Into the Fire, if you're really lucky and have the event glitch and leave you up top after killing the pyrelord you can hang on to that too and not have to do any dailies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not that it matters anymore, but you don't need to complete Into the Fire, either, after the 2nd day (due to how you have to open up the fire hawk, you have to turn it in at least once). Keep it completed and don't turn it in and you can bypass the flames to go straight to the bird.<br />
