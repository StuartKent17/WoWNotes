Enchantments at the AH

Enchantments at the AH<br />
It's not as uber as it sounded first but it's still decent, it will probably means that you'll be able to throw most of the &quot;minor&quot; armor enchants to the AH. (Hint : level your enchanting now, Greater Eternal/Nether Essences aren't cheap)<br />
It was stated at BlizzCon that we would like to see enchanting on the Auction House as a tradable profession at some point. However; we do still want to keep the personal interaction there of finding an enchanter to some degree. Which may translate to something along the lines of requiring personal contact be involved with only the very highest end enchants.<br />
<br />
<br />
Low population servers<br />
Drysc posted a few more words about character transfers and low population servers. <br />
Not at the moment, although there's a new one opened for the Oceanic transfers I don't suspect it would actually meet the criteria you're looking for in a &quot;new realm&quot;.<br />
<br />
We've been very successful with the free transfers, and continued use of the &quot;Recommended&quot; tag which recently took The Forgotten Coast up to a very nice population, and that should continue to help grow the community there. It's now on Shattered Halls and although it's early, looks to be helping there as well.<br />
<br />
A lot of what I see posted as proof a realm is &quot;dead&quot; appears to be a combination of personal experience and perception of a situation. I am constantly reading posts where someone says that their realm needs help, I see the name and think &quot;No way, you're crazy&quot;, and sure enough their faction is in the majority and their population is greater than 2/3 of the other realms. I think it's easy to experience some lack of interaction at some point, maybe have been looking at the user-submitted skewed population data on some website, and jump to a conclusion that there's a correlation. In actuality, it's just that no one wants to run that one non-heroic with you, there's plenty of people playing though.<br />
<br />
For the realms that do have a low population, and there are few left, they're definitely improving, and if we haven't targeted them yet to get people on them then we will as soon as we can.<br />
<br />
<br />
Winter Veil patterns fix<br />
Small reminder, these patterns should be hotfixed today on US servers and tomorrow on EU ones. <br />
We certainly do care about our players and plan on making the recipes available before the holiday is at an end. Penney Copperpinch (Orgrimmar) and Wulmort Jinglepocket (Ironforge) will most likely be our vehicles to do so. However, this is one of those fixes that cannot be hotfixed as easily as others. Not every issue can be rectified on a realm while it's up and running, unfortunately.<br />
<br />
The next time we do rolling restarts (scheduled for Tuesday at this time), you should hopefully be able to retrieve the recipes you desire from those NPCs.<br />
<br />
There's no minimum skill level to purchase the recipes off the vendor, so don't worry there. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3466327626&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=16#306))<br />

Unlimited Escapism 4<br />
Unlimited Escapism 4 is out ! If you liked the 4 others videos, you'll like this one too, both versions of the video are being mirrored to the download server but I can't guarantee how stable it will be ^^.

<br />
Basically, it's running on an old server with an awfully bugged version of lighttpd, and I eventually have to restart it every few hours because it crashes and my sysadmin isn't here. (I totally fail at UNIX)</div></div><hr />
