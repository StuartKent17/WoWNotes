<br />
<br />
Seal of the Martyr now makes all your melee attacks deal [Numbers] additional Holy damage.<br />
<br />
Unleashing this Seal's energy instantly causes [Numbers] Holy damage at the cost of health equal to 33% of the damage caused.<br />
<br />
For reference, the old text: <br />
<br />
<br />
All melee attacks deal [Numbers] additional Holy damage, but the Paladin loses health equal to 10% of the total damage inflicted. Lasts 30 min.<br />
<br />
Unleashing this Seal's energy will judge an enemy, instantly causing [Numbers] Holy damage at the cost of health equal to 33% of the damage caused.<br />
<br />
So recoil on the judge is still 33%, but gone from seal damage? We can hold off judging to pass raid damage situations without GC's utterly insane recommendation to burn 28% of base mana swap out seals. My only concern would be that JotW is ALL of our regen without losing a DPS glyph for Glyph of Seal of Blood and theory leaves us at time till OOM with no judging at what, 20 seconds?<br />

If I am reading this right... before Imp Defensive stance only raised your melee damage, which to me means only your white hits (aka standard swing)<br />
<br />
Now that it is increasing PHYSICAL damage by 5/10%, is that really a 5/10% buff to all Warrior abilities that do physical damage? which is everything?<br />

Heroic strike, devestate, S slam, revenge, shockwave, tclap, etc.</div></div><hr />

Didn't you know? This spell is baseline! Which means not only Holy Pallies can cast it! And with it lasting 1 minute, I mean you would only have to waste one global cooldown per minute.. but how horrible, thats really not your job, I get it... You can't use one of your own abilities to decrease the damage you receive.. I understand...</div></div><hr />

Didn't you know? This spell is baseline! Which means not only Holy Pallies can cast it! And with it lasting 1 minute, I mean you would only have to waste one global cooldown per minute.. but how horrible, thats really not your job, I get it... You can't use one of your own abilities to decrease the damage you receive.. I understand...<br />
<br />
<br />
So shadow priests should be casting PWS on tanks as well? SS is supposed to be cast by holy pallies, maybe ret casting it on themselves if they feel like helping out the healers.<br />
I can't see any prot pallies wanting to have to work this into thier rotation. Especially for 8+ min boss fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Melee = white damage<br />
Physical = all warrior damage<br />
<br />
Correct? Pls someone else confirm.<br />
<br />
Melee is not = white damage. It includes at the very least Heroic Strike which specifically states that it causes melee damage, but I suspect would exclude Heroic Throw and Thunderclap.<br />
<br />
The Enrage from Improved Defensive Stance has always said &quot;Physical damage increased by 10%&quot; so I suspect this is just a tooltip clarification and not an actual buff.</div></div><hr />

How the hell did you get that from what i wrote?<br />
They are overnerfing the new talent. Our DPS on PTR was fine with Rip and Rake ticks critting. With only Rip ticks critting, Glyph of Savage Roar nerfed combined with the Savage Roar change, it's too much.</div></div><hr />

And since the Shattering Throw change was already mentioned by GC some time ago I can't quite beleive that this build holds buffs for all three Warrior trees and no nerfs... though the Prot changes are... well... meh...?<br />

PS: Boub, you're quite quick deleting firsts today, huh? I concur that action :D<br />

Shattering Throw was nerfed, and Bladestorm now only hit 4 targets instead of all targets. That's 2 nerfs.</div></div><hr />

Being a Holy Paladin this new talent is definitely something I would want to pick up depending on my roll in the raid.<br />
<br />
Currently Sacred Shield absorbs around 2500-2700 damage over 30 seconds every time it procs on live. Picking up this talent would make it around 2900-3300 damage absorbed every six seconds over one minute. That's (give or take depending on your gear) 32,400 damage over the full duration. That's huge compared to the default.<br />
<br />
And it would free up one GCD every 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, what i don't get:<br />
Divine Guardian (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=53530) *New Talent* - Tier 4 - Improve the effectiveness of your Divine Sacrifice spell by an additional 5/10% and increases the duration of your Sacred Shield by 50/100% and the amount absorbed by 10/20%.<br />
<br />
On the one hand, they don't give the skelleton that is Retribution new talents, on the other hand, they stuff more and more crap into the protection tree, especially stuff that has zero synergy with Retribution. How the hell do they want to get us into speccing into other trees with these changes?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Maneken</div><div class="date">2009-03-26, 11:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Overall this Blood thing is what 5%-6% damage boost for ret? That makes up for the losses we've been reporting. And it gets rid of the &quot;Do 300 dps to yourself&quot; part of Blood so that's good too. It also pulls us away (slightly) from the Stack Strength at All Costs thing we have been on recently and starts to add value to Hit and Haste. Our ArP is baked in with all the holy damage, so Warriors and some DKs get to keep that stuff.<br />
<br />
That pretty much takes care of ret paladin PTR concerns.<br />
<br />
Hey, while we are talking, how about that visible libram thing they were talking about pre-Wrath? I'd like to see my book.<br />

Sorry, but Math says otherwise. We're going to gain more damage from Seal than we lose from the Judgement nerf + less RV damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Honestly I'm pretty OK with that. Keep the seal damage constant between unreliable SoComm procs and dependable SoB. Then SoB is a clear upgrade in the damage attached to auto-attack (sustained DPS) and loading the SoComm damage into the Crit-Judge when stunned (PvP Burst). Really it decouples our PvP and PvE damage and lets them adjust weights without blowing up things they don't want to. In theory. They could, depending on how likely that is.<br />
<br />
While I'm still dreaming, if they take the burst out of our toolbox they might put the interrupt, school lock, gap closer, or snare we keep asking for. Though Exo on players with 40% boost between Glyph and easy talents auto-crit on Warlock pets and Demonform/Lichform players our burst might be over the top still. Who knows? That remains to be seen.<br />
<br />
All that is left is adding some Ret-related stuff to low Holy/Prot. I could explode myself with sacrifice in Prot or use all of my mana healing (strongly off-healing for a few seconds) with low holy... I guess. Aura Mastery?<br />
<br />

<br />
This is hilariously stupid. Aren't Holy Pallies supposed to be casting this? I will not give up 8% crit to go get this. Prot pallies now cast it on yourselves!<br />
<br />
Either remove this or move it up to tier 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes... you clearly know what you talking about... Just because you are Holy it should go to Holy Paladins, right? <br />
<br />
It's a baseline ability, so it's for ALL Paladins. Maybe you can understand that you might be playing without a Holy Paladin and you can surprisingly be PROT. This is a nice spell to mitigate damage, and that's your job as Prot, amazing isn't it? But by being in a 30 Sec cycle it's not something you usual refresh during a fight, it's something you use when facing several mobs on a trash pull so you cast it before the pull, this will make it a good ability. Get a clue... Prot paladins scale Spell Power with Stamina. And if it wouldn't be bugged for scaling with Ret even Ret would use it for PvP for example.<br />
<br />
So... just because you would like it, doesnt' mean you should have it. Holy Paladins are too powerful in PvP as it is and damn good on PvE Like always, so they don't want to throw them everything. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry but Sacred Shield is not only Holy, so get over it.</div></div><hr />

They botched the priest changes (as long as the mana regen is nerfed for healing priests, the job's done), and they didn't do anything significant with locks yet.. Oh, you were expecting actual positive changes, sorry pallys and DKs are hogging those.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yea well, i'm still under the impression that priests got the nerf kick for mana regen, holy especially, and disc definitely didnt get away scratch free either. Changing Rapture to 2.5% mana once per 12 seconds is like putting a time limit to illumination for holy pallys. You rarely see them go oom, but they have some how avoided this whole nerfing the healers attack. I can go with the mana regen at the end of the shield's life, but to cut out DA and limiting to once per 12 seconds just isnt right. As for holy, catching those out of 5 second rule mana ticks via clear-casts were key to getting through the longer fights with any mana at all, especially if dps was an issue in a raid.<br />
<br />
Now i know they were worried about disc in pvp, but if there's so much problems with pvp, why not make a separate talent tree system for pvp to help make that system better without messing with pve workings to such a huge extent?<br />

Some of my friends didn't like me bitching about it this week and told me to make a rogue... so I am. Once they get buffed I imagine they'll be a powerhouse just like they were last expansion, allowing me to play an energy-based melee class competitively like I had wanted.<br />

These buffs with nerfs attached have to stop, honestly. Do they not have anyone running numbers in house so that they need to throw it on the PTR to get even the most basic results out? What a joke. <br />

What part of applies to ALL combo point generating moves was unclear. If an attack generates combo points, having points in Lethality will make it will crit for more damage. <br />

Glad some people are stoked about upcoming changes, but as someone who has decently geared feral druid and a warlock (druid is getting its paws wet in arena, 733 res atm) kinda disappointed.<br />
<br />
Primal gore I thought would be the turning point in feral dps, not just in PVE but in PVP. For example, can you imagine having a 90% crit chance on loathweb and applying your most powerful bleeds? Lacerates critting would help me keep aggro say in a fight like Malygos where dps actually gave me one hell of a challenge (favorite fight in this game btw). <br />
<br />
Rake/Rip critting would let me not waste my energy/combo points on critting a well-geared holy paladin or dk for...I don't know 4k...it would let me apply damage that cannot be stopped (reduced perhaps by shit like IBF/grace) as well as giving me the option to stun at will with maim.<br />
<br />
Anyways, this goes out to the PTR testers...are my dreams of PVE tanking in one spec and PVP cat/bear dps and PVE cat dps in 2 specs gone? Rake ticks for 1550 easy without raid buffs at the moment...telling me I'm not going to see 3100 damage popping up next to all those white hits makes me wonder who thought up primal gore in the first place...my 2 cents I guess.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) CS is still the same old boring useless skill<br />
2) Is the buff to SoM enough to compensate for the previous crit nerf and the current judgement nerf? I havent test it yet but i dont think it is. Best case scenario it's about the same or a tad more, which means that we'll still be at the bottom of the dps list<br />
3) The recoil is still there. Yes it is nerfed but it's still there. It's a fact that retri paladins are the only class that have to hurt themselves to deliver rly low if not the lowest dps ingame. This is absolutely ridiculous.<br />
4) There's still no useful way to spend 10+ talent points. I dont know if they're planing sth about it but i'm not optimistic. Seeing the changes till now i'm disapointed. Nothing fresh nothing creative. I dont see why would they come up with any nice new ideas about our 10+ useless talent points<br />
5) SoC sux even more now.<br />
6) Our mana regen is still an issue.<br />
<br />
Conclusion : Retribution is currently the worse class talent tree ingame. One could say it's broken and that wouldnt be far from the truth. To change that, serious changes are required. Not just the usual old crap aka tune up or down the seal dmg. The mechanics of the tree need to be reworked.<br />
<br />
Currently there are no signs of such acts. So retridins will remain at the same point they always were which is at the bottom of the dps list and the most undesired class in a raid. Especially now that they dont have anything special to offer. <br />
<br />
My advice : Reroll and dont waste your time with a broken class if u want to have a guaranteed raid spot and do competitive dps. I've already switched to warlock and i'm really happy that i dont have to worry about such crap ;D</div></div><hr />

You have no idea how to read those stats.<br />
<br />
Yes, the 0/32/39 of all specs is the most common spec. All that means is that Blood DKs tend more toward a single set of talents than Unholy or Frost DKs. <br />
Blood DKs on the whole are still in the minority, they just all happen to spec the same way as each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
and here he starts to talk himself out of it.<br />
<br />
how do u decide if a spec is &quot;more&quot; frost than unholy?<br />
if it is not by the amount of talent points in a tree, then is it by how deep u go into it?<br />
or is it going by what skills such a dk uses the most?<br />
or wait, is it some own made-up scale to fit ur own arguments?<br />
<br />
the talent build list down there makes a difference between different 0/32/39 specs, if u did not notice. that a blood is on the top just tells us that blood has a certain build that is flavored over others. it does NOT imply in any way that blood is the most common spec overall.<br />
<br />
oh, and even if u shift over enough from unholy to frost, so that unholy falls below blood.<br />
then ... frost will have a higher percentage than blood.</div></div><hr />

It's stupid that a TALENTED Seal is worse than a base one. It should be the number one DPS seal for someone going Ret spec. You're wasting talent points for it. Change its to a deep Ret talent, buff it to be better than Blood/Martyr.<br />

If I was to guess, I reckon either they will remove it and replace it with a well needed pvp talent and leave cs alone. Or they will add something to the proc of command to make people use it in pvp. Blizzard knows command should be the pvp seal and that blood should be the pve seals. Our dps was too low, so in pve they have fixed this. I'm willing to bet there will be a pvp change to soc in the next couple of builds, otherwise as people said, what's the point in command.<br />
<br />
That said, I think people need to look at the numbers. Testing has shown that the 10k judgements are now 8k, ok huge 2k reduction every 7 seconds BUT the seal is now procing for around 1000-1500 and people are seeing crits of 3000....I would much rather have a seal procing 100% of the time for 3k on White hits, cs and ds than having 2k added to judgement...if you work it out just 3k from cs and blood could equal an instant 6k and you think burst is down?If the recoil is gone from seal procs this is a massive buff.</div></div><hr />

LoL... you're probably very unlucky with CDs... trinket out of the stun. Unless you're using it on &quot;LoLpentance&quot;...]<br />

My point wasnt the stun, it was the burst that they can get when they do it right atm, and I dont see any major nerfs to it. And I didnt say they have better CC:s than a rogue, just mentioned that they DO have CC that is long enough when used right..<br />
<br />
But yeah, I dont have problems with retris in arena atm, I can control them pretty easily when I have CD:s, but if retri gets to burst me I wont survive for long.</div></div><hr />

After last round of DRW nerfs (only tooltip in last patch, but just a matter of time)<br />
<br />
<br />
Being able to have a permanant ghoul with &lt; 20 points in the unholy tree was a huge passive DPS boost to Blood and Frost DPS builds to the point where a DPS build without it would have been pretty much gimped. Just having a permanant ghoul was a 300-500 DPS boost for Blood DKs which would have required substantial nerfing of deep blood to balance around.<br />
<br />
If all specs have to spec to get the permanant ghoul then it may as well have been made baseline for all trees so it seems Blizz preferred to keep the existing version where the Ghould is basically more of an Unholy thing rather than forcing all DPS DKs to go 16 points unholy at least.<br />
<br />
As for nerfing Death Strike to force people to use Obliterate I think TBH they should just change Obliterate to not remove diseases and be done with it. It's damage has already been nerfed massively so the penalty is arguably unneeded. More importantly I think the removes diseases is not a mechanic that any DK regards as fun.</div></div><hr />

1) They WILL change CS<br />
2) They WILL fix SotM/B<br />
3)They WILL fix recoil<br />
4)They NEED to fix our trees<br />
5)SoC has NOT changed<br />
6) With the new glyph or without? ;p <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Hey, I'm not arguing that CS is great now. Damage is where it needs to be, they are working up additional effects.<br />
2) Seriously? Bugged patch is bugged. Martyr and Blood each got half of the changes. Also, any aura you cycle to on the PTR is apparently displaying the Ret aura graphic on top of its original graphic. Divine Storm is getting an 80% bonus from the venture co. ret libram instead of 80 damage. They horked something up I'd be shocked if it went live like this (mainly the libram thing, but other bugs are there and easily reproducable).<br />
3) Unless they change the text back, I'm waiting for the fix to fly off the handle. See 2. If they come back and say &quot;Oh, we meant to leave 10% recoil on the seal, lemme change that wording&quot; then I'll get the pitchfork and torch and drive to Irvine.<br />
4) I'm agreeing with you on this one. They want me to keep just enough mana to run a DPS cycle then drop one third of my points into non-DPS talents in order to... Heal for three seconds? Take a ton of raid damage and die? Not really great alternatives.<br />
5) Relative to Blood, the Judge is better, but the procs are infrequent and unpredictable. These are arguably the correct concepts for the seals. Blood = More sustained damage, Command = Burst from Judgment. From this standpoint either can be adjusted without PvE or PvP messing each other up simultaneously. And either would need to be adjusted to stay in line with DPS requirements.<br />
6.) Link to post by a person smarter than me HERE (http://elitistjerks.com/f76/t37843-retribution_paladin_thread_wrath_3_0_a/p110/#post1163311). &quot;TLDR: It's not infinite mana either way. I think we're best glyphed Judgement, Consecration, Exorcism - SoB glyph doesn't have enough value added.&quot; All calculations were pre-last patch so if I had to guess, SoB glyph would become less useful if the recoil is in fact removed.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I wait for bug fixes before I start to panic. I'm open to panic though. Remember when they &quot;fixed&quot; Seal of the Crusader? I lost something like 50 DPS, back when 50 DPS was SRS BIZNESS.<br />
<br />
The interesting part is that the -1 sec judge cooldown is making it to our next season Gladiator gear and (of course) not continuing to Tier 8. This would seem to suggest they want to make big judgments a PvP thing, with big seals being a PvE thing. However as always, this could be Blizz being inexplicable. (See Vengeance Nerf, Crusade and 2h weapon spec being very similar, etc)</div></div><hr />

Roll Eyes We're not bad off. Yes our potential dps in ideal situations on live may be slightly less than other classes, but considering all the other awesome stuff we can do and how much raids like our buffs, I'm not complaining.<br />
<br />
The PTR setup actually is giving us better SoM/SoB, and the mana regeneration setup of judgment of the wise + glyph if needed is giving us even more flexibility than when we relied on getting mana from being healed.<br />
<br />
Remember the PTR is not done yet, and nobody knows what our final state will look like. They're still aiming for the ideal being slightly less than pures. Again, something you probably won't see since fights fluctuate a lot.<br />
<br />
To me, the only things I wonder about is:<br />
<br />
a) why they don't focus more on our talented seal, lots of classes get a talented ability, and it usually is in a primary spot in the rotation for that talent build. Why is SoC more of a secondary utility seal?<br />
<br />
b) Ret talent setup is sort of thin, but I'm actually ok with that because it allows us to talent other things that aren't just DPS in order to help our groups. Believe it or not, that's the whole reason I like being a paladin. I'm not pure DPS, I'm a hybrid that has other benefits to make a raid go well.<br />
<br />
So be thankful for those extra talent points we have now! We can use them for something interesting.</div></div><hr />

Feral was insane on ptr, our druid that was always bottom 5 dps was #1 on pretty much everything and he doesn't even have a working dot timer on ptr.<br />
<br />
Feral DPS on the ptr is really high. Yes, they needed to be nerfed a little so they weren't trumping pure classes on every fight by a great margin. I wish they could find a different way to nerf them rather than removing rake from primal gore. <br />
<br />
They changed the savage roar glyph and that will help some. Honestly, they could probably remove the savage roar glyph and ferals would have been happier with that than them taking rake off of primal gore. <br />
<br />
Primal gore is an extremely fun talent for feral druids because they always sport a very high crit chance. Being able to see bleeds crit is heaven for a feral druid. I wish they would let us keep bleeds that crit but tone us down in other ways.</div></div><hr />

Because DK tanks are not OP? Are you serious right now... I hope your either drunk or something in saying that because that's the biggest load of crap.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't agree more as I just transferred from a feral tank to feral dps primal gore is going to be the well needed booster for cat dps. The removing of rake from primal gore is a downer, but they needed to (for lack of a better word) nerf it down a bit. I do agree in saying they could have just removed the savage roar glyph and left rake in primal gore though because it will for sure be nice to see bleeds critting and becoming more fun for kitty dps and more useful =]</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cruscontrol</div><div class="date">2009-03-27, 09:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The druid nerfs on primal gore is a definate downer as well as the SR glyph. I mean it's kinda funny how people dont think hybrid dps should always be lower than pure dps classes. I'm feral dps and i top meters right now on patch at about 5.5kdps. that more than most. It shouldnt be a matter of since you're a pure dps class you should automatically be higher on dps. It's a matter of who can play their class better. I'm in ptr and I was hitting at about 6300 or so on patch and around 5.8k still on ulduar bosses. kologarn is an exception lol, but yea that may seem high to some since im a druid, but if you know how to play your class and are good at it than whats all the fuss about it. Well hey im just trolling now lol. Main point is that overall feral dps ive seen arent that great and this would definately help out their dps, but guess those who know what there doing gettign this buff it probably would seem a little OP. lol Druids OP my goodness</div></div><hr />

There is no way Ret spec is the &quot;worst class spec in the game&quot; - that's just ridiculous hyperbole and absolutely pathetic. It is an issue that JoM has high recoil damage in PvE but in PvP it's a necessary balance. They need to find something that removes or at least remedies its recoil in PvE without affecting PvP...if they can do that then case solved. <br />
<br />
Or they could make it deal a % of your HP instead of % of the damage, that would solve the issues with its recoil damage scaling insanely with fights like Thaddius and would still keep it in check for PvP.<br />
<br />
JoM is a problem, but to go as far as to say Ret is the worst class spec in the game just wreaks of former TBC retardation.</div></div><hr />

Seriosly, most of the times when retri gets the HoJ on me (500 resi rogue) I die during the stun or leave with like 20% hp. And yes, you got CC :p<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all I wasn't talking about now. I was talking about after the patch.<br />
<br />
And yes, a rogue is probably the only thing I can kill in one stun lock, but never:<br />
<br />
A. A rogue that is being healed in arena.<br />
<br />
B. Any healer.<br />
<br />
And lol, we got CC yes, but what do we have compared to other classes? Jack shit. We relied on our burst damage (even though it was comparable to that of Hunters, though they also have millions of CC) and now they take that away from us, that's what I'm saying.</div></div><hr />
