Mount Hyjal: In Defense of Nordrassil<br />
For years, Mount Hyjal and the wounded World Tree, Nordrassil, have remained cut off from the rest of Azeroth. Sealed away within a protective field of dense foliage by Malfurion Stormrage, Nordrassil has been slowly recovering from the devastation of the Third War, when Malfurion called upon the tree's power to destroy the archdemon Archimonde and repel the forces of the Burning Legion and Scourge. Now, with the impending cataclysm, the World Tree's well-being is threatened once more. From the Firelands within the Elemental Plane, Ragnaros and his minions prepare to burst into Hyjal and set Nordrassil ablaze -- and the conflagration would endanger all life on Azeroth.<br />
<br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, players will have the opportunity to explore the newly reopened Mount Hyjal as Azeroth's heroes, with the help of Ysera, Malfurion Stormrage and Hamuul Runetotem, are called upon to push back the armies of the Firelord, banish Ragnaros to the Elemental Plane and lay waste to the twilight dragon stronghold in nearby Darkwhisper Gorge. This all-new level 78-82 zone will feature multiple quest hubs, phased terrain and quest lines, portals to micro-zones within the Firelands, an all-new raid dungeon, and much more.<br />
<br />
The World Tree<br />
Players will be able to enter Hyjal by way of Moonglade, to take on a series of high-stakes quests in a historic location alongside some of Azeroth's most renowned heroes. With a longstanding rivalry among the night elf leadership threatening to undermine the campaign against Deathwing, players will quickly discover the task of defending Nordrassil is more daunting than they had anticipated. In order to succeed, they must seek out the help of extremely powerful allies: the Ancients.<br />
<br />
The Ancients<br />
To protect Nordrassil and heal the devastation the invading fire elementals are causing across Mount Hyjal, players must first recapture the shrine of the wolf god Goldrinn. The ogres surrounding the shrine will not leave peacefully, but seizing the shrine will allow players their first opportunity to infiltrate the Firelands and shut down a key Twilight portal, slowing the advance of the nearby Twilight's Hammer in Hyjal.<br />
<br />
With the first portal dismantled, players will soon be sought by the wilderness spirit Aessina to assist in cleansing and healing the nearby forest, ultimately returning the land to its former splendor. This small victory, however, isn't enough to deter the Twilight Remnants from attempting to scorch the forest once more. As you struggle to keep these foes at bay, you'll also need to help the Guardians of Hyjal -- a new neutral faction of druids and worshippers of the Ancients -- repopulate the forest with animal life. It's even rumored that Malorne has been spotted in the wilderness. Perhaps further investigation is necessary....<br />
<br />
Amid the chaos, the Druids of the Talon will need players' assistance to resurrect the goddess of winged creatures. Players begin the process by helping to slay a group of black dragons and closing a second Firelands portal from within. Just when you think things might be heating up, you'll need to fight through a burning night elf town to shut down the third and final portal with the assistance of the turtle god Tortollus.<br />
<br />
Darkwhisper Gorge<br />
Your successes in Hyjal will ultimately lead you to the assembly of the Ancients, who have set a plan in motion to bring a powerful ally and demigod back into this realm. Before that can happen, however, you will need to infiltrate Darkwhisper Gorge disguised as a follower of the Twilight's Hammer, acting quickly to sow discord within the entrenched faction, weakening it for the coming struggle. Only time will tell if the Ancients' plan is a success -- but you'll need to do your part if there's any hope of saving Mount Hyjal from the twilight dragons, Ragnaros, and his minions of the Elemental Plane.<br />
<br />
Firelands<br />
More information on this all-new level-85 raid dungeon is coming soon. <br />

But Mount Hyjal already blows them away in terms of epic-ness.<br />

To say nothing of Hellfire Peninsula and Zangramarsh! If this is where we START leveling in Cataclysm, that's a damn good sign.</div></div><hr />

As for all the comments about &lt;insert word&gt; was merely a setback. Yeah, its a bit annoying sometimes when they bring everything back, but since resurrection seems fairly commonplace, doesn't really seem that bad.<br />

Besides a lot of the lore even before WoW was made had a lot of people dying and refusing to accept that and somehow being brought back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A year? Four years have passed since the forces of the Alliance and Horde banded together, to stop the might of the Burning Legion... You should recognize those words. Four years to the beginning of vanilla, probably 2 years in vanilla, 2 years of TBC, 2 years of Wrath. That equals a decade since anyone has been to Hyjal. If you're referring to the Caverns of time, that is going back in time, not to it's present state.</div></div><hr />

Four years have passed since the forces of the Alliance and Horde banded together, to stop the might of the Burning Legion... You should recognize those words. Four years to the beginning of vanilla, probably 2 years in vanilla, 2 years of TBC, 2 years of Wrath. That equals a decade since anyone has been to Hyjal. If you're referring to the Caverns of time, that is going back in time, not to it's present state.<br />
<br />
Each expansion counts as one year as of the vanilla WoW (shown in the timeline on worldofwarcraft.com), so it has been a total of 8 years.<br />

im right behind u on this one, why cant bosses come back ? especially bosses like Ragnaros/KilJaden/Old Gods who we fought in their WEAKENED state where we arent even sure if it was them or their buffed illusion ?<br />
<br />
also end of Cataclysm Expansion (my guess):<br />
u fight DW with Alex's help then when he almost is near death either Azshara or Bolvar pop and ZOMFG blast Alex off and kill her. ( bolvar for revenge since her breath made him what he is now and Azshara cos she and DW are partners in crime )</div></div><hr />

You do know that he is neutral? and not against horde? just as runetotem aswell. they both hate war and want peace.<br />

Pretty much. I don't think there's anything wrong with the logic of it, now that I think about it, people are just tired of seeing recycled bosses.<br />

As large an advantage as a mage has in quick transportation to any major city. It's not like the mage couldn't have gotten there eventually, but if you can shave 10 minutes off your travel time from, say, Undercity to Thunder Bluff, I'd say it's and advantage nonetheless.</div></div><hr />

So, I heard demi-gods never really &quot;die&quot; and they just go to the Emerald Dream. Now that Malfurion is back, King Druid, it makes a helluva lot more sense.<br />
<br />
Ragnaros? It's been known since practically Vanilla that all we did was banish him back to the Elemental Plane.<br />
<br />
Original, fresh, surprising attempt.<br />
<br />
The only one I have a problem with is Nefarian. The tag-out theory is pretty silly and worthy of something in some crappy anime (not hating on anime, but there are shitty ones).</div></div><hr />

Well, if they introduce brand new Lore characters Blizzard get a lot of 'Who the hell is this guy?', there's not that many current lore guys who are AWOL at the mo and with all the druids and their demigods they were never really killed, just went 'someplace else'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This.<br />
<br />
Agamaggan was an awesome ally in the War of the Ancients (Cenarius went to HIM for help against the Burning Legion), sacrificing himself so that Malfurion could reach the Well of Eternity. According to wowwiki, his spirit currently resides in the afterlife, so it shouldn't be too hard to bring him back.<br />
<br />
Plus, he can do this:<br />
<br />
<br />
Among his abilities, Agamaggan could stomp the ground with his massive hoof, breathe corrosive acid upon his enemies and cast a rain of thorns that would detach from his back causing considerable harm.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
Hesitation in combat is unknown to Agamaggan. He will fearlessly charge and throw his full strength against any opponent. His first assault usually concentrates on spellcasters, eliminating their unpredictability from the field of battle. In the middle of a group of opponents, he will use his special attacks to knock down a number of opponents. Believing that he can gain an enemy’s strength by consuming it, he will do his best to keep fallen opponents from being recovered or revived by their allies.<br />
<br />
Giant hoof stomp? Acid breath? Thorn rain? Sounds like my kind of boar.<br />
<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Agamaggan<br />
<br />
Edit: And this little tidbit adds all the more reason:<br />
<br />
<br />
Legend says Agamaggan might walk among the living someday<br />
<br />
In conclusion, I want Mr. Superboar back. Now.</div></div><hr />

-Who the hell buffed her up to be Deathwings Size ? <br />
<br />
<br />
They aren't the exact same size, and all aspects didn't differ so much in size anyway. Also seeing how Deathwing has those adamantite plates (or w/e) he can't grow that much, since he has no one to replace the plates.</div></div><hr />

Staghelm pretty much died in the Stormrage novel. He was driven insane by the the nightmare and corrupted Teldrassil. Also I doubt that the nightelf population would actually try to over throw those two lovebirds (who are married now, yey! :&gt;)</div></div><hr />

No, this is a corporate decision, notice how little detail Alextrasza has compared to Deathwing &quot;we want the customers to focus on Deathwing, our next $$$ cow&quot;<br />
Any artist who seeks to make a finished work, wants it all to fit together, so u can't have this very detailed character and the one to the left that looks like a sketch.<br />
Had the artist been free to finish it, then both dragons would look totally awesome together.<br />
<br />
Also Cenarius? Plz he was such an idiot the way he rushed antagonizing the Horde, his own fault he died, that pompous jerk.<br />
If Blizz is such a big fan of bringing back old characters, why not bring back old Grom Hellscream? Just so he can kill Cenarius again.</div></div><hr />

Any artist who seeks to make a finished work, wants it all to fit together, so u can't have this very detailed character and the one to the left that looks like a sketch.<br />
Had the artist been free to finish it, then both dragons would look totally awesome together.<br />
<br />
Do you.. honestly believe this? Alextrasza looks a bit 'duller' because she actually has flesh and scales going on there, which have been obviously dulled by nicks and such over the eons. She's an obviously living creature. Deathwing, on the other hand, is as much armor as he is flesh and scale, and you can plainly see that. Not to mention, the fact that Alextrasza is a bit more blurred is obviously implying motion, whereas Deathwing is standing his ground and is defensive. And REGARDLESS, it's entirely possible to have a piece of art have way too much detail. The point is to focus on Deathwing, because.. that is the focus. He is the threat, he's the terrifying dragon that is half-armor half-flesh, and trying to destroy the planet. I can't imagine how you got 'Blizz only cares about $$, they had a chokehold on the artist and told him to make Alextrasza look boring.'</div></div><hr />

It's a COMPANY not kindergarten funplay with colors. They have their next cash cow, Deathwing, to think about, from a businessman's perspective giving a memo like over-focus on Deathwing makes $en$e.

Well yeah, but somehow with all the lore that has been added since then it feels weird, cenarius (killed by a little buffed orcs mind you) are strong enough to return, but Illidan, Arthas, and so forth were not, even though they are supposed to be much stronger at the time they died.</div></div><hr />

Last I checked &quot;shut up because you don't agree with me&quot; is not how you win arguments.<br />
<br />
Also, why can't you also consider some other arguments? Focus on deathwing with sharper colors to make him appear stronger and more resilient than Alexstraza who is losing the fight, or maybe to show that Alexstraza is fleeing since is certainly appears like she's using her hind legs to shove herself in the opposite direction of deathwing.</div></div><hr />

Once again, &quot;shut up you're bad/ugly/stupid&quot; is not an argument winner... ever.<br />
<br />
Deathwing's backlegs aren't even drawn in the picture. The object snaking out from under deathwing is his tail, his hindlegs are obscured into the background.<br />
<br />
Alexstraza actually has hindlegs drawn into the picture if you look carefully. Her left hindleg is more visible as a curve against the sky, but the blurring of the legs is clearly intended to show dirt and dust being thrown up in the battle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Coloring doesn't explain why she should be so sketchy, do u honestly believe she looks like a finished piece? Yes or no.<br />
Also, does Alexstraza have a different Fysiology than other dragons, so that her back legs start WAY further back? Obviously it just illustrates how little love she got in this work.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qorpse</div><div class="date">2010-04-14, 01:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">In regards to the Alex/Deathwing wallpaper and people who critique every small little aspect (No pun intended.) of this game and previews thereof:<br />
<br />
The motion is going away from Deathwing, not towards him. You can tell by looking at points on Deathwings chest (i.e. - Lava flowing with the range of motion away from him, not vice versa). I believe the artists intention was to show possibly one of 2 things happening:<br />
<br />
1.) Deathwing swiped at Alex, she's getting rocked backwards.<br />
2.) A heck of a lot of wind whirring by due to the battle.<br />
<br />
As far as proportions, who knows why she is his size. We've seen other &quot;official&quot; wallpapers where he is copping a squat pretty much on top of several city buildings, dwarfing them (pun intended). Meanwhile, she's hanging out at the Wrathgate, about the same size as a building, if not a bit smaller.<br />
<br />
Perhaps she got a buff (Elixir of Giant growth?) to make her larger. That or she has been taking anabolic steroids and HGH. Maybe a little of that rBST stuff they inject into cattle.<br />
<br />
Who knows! Great picture though and this update has me really excited.<br />

<br />
<br />
That's ur assumption that it's his tail n not his leg. Why u think he has his tail between his legs, is beyond me.<br />
<br />
I wondered about that thingy, was her left backleg? But it's too blurred to tell, it could be something part of her left wing instead. Not much to go by here.<br />
But ur logic fails very bad, if that is the placing of her left backleg, then where on the other side is the right backleg? It mysteriously isn't shown.<br />
<br />
Deathwing is the focus, so most work was focused on him, I still kinda like the work, I just happen to be a fan of belf dwagon ;)<br />

<br />
Back to bite again. I think Alextrasza got a lot of love in that pic. The detail in the wings is awesome - you can see the veins in the membrane on the underside as light shines through it - as is the detail in the chest scales. I also personally don't think she looks too masculine there, but that's just because I've always considered dragons as super epic, extremely large and powerful-looking creatures, regardless of their gender. I never liked the idea of a thin, graceful dragon, outside of the mythology of Chinese dragons.<br />
<br />
Also kinda weighing in on the demigod info, that has me really excited. I think it'd be awesome if the old animal gods that were slain in the original War of the Ancients were brought back in, as though 10 thousand years has proven to be enough time for them to 'regenerate,' just in the nick of time to help battle Deathwing and the invasion by the elemental lords Ragnaros, Al'kalir, and who knows, maybe Neptulon will make an appearance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, I think she looks finished. If you look at her underbelly below her arm you can see that those scales have more detail because they wouldn't be affected as much by wind/dust since her arm is blocking it. The artist put some effort and thought into this, not &quot;let's make it blurry so blizzard can make more money&quot;. <br />
<br />
And... I already addressed her &quot;physiology&quot;. Deathwing's legs aren't even visible, you can't say where they start.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also like that they will be utalizing the gorge south of Winterspring as well, shame to see areas essentially go to waste. Also I wonder if we're entering through moonglade does that mean the envirement around there has created a path and moonglade's been messed up or is it a simple portal is what i'm wondering.</div></div><hr />

Ya, characters that existed in some book that I haven't the slightest interest to read don't exist at all as far as I'm concerned. Even Cenarius I'm excited to see, because he hasn't appeared in WoW yet. I don't care if he died in Warcraft 3. He was an awesome character and he deserves to have some involvement in this expansion.<br />
<br />
Honestly, you people take lore more seriously than Blizzard does. Which is to say that you take it seriously at all. Blizzard doesn't give a rat's ass about continuity, and never have. One could say that's a continuity in and of itself. Blizzard has been very consistent about changing lore when it's convenient. It's kind of their little inside joke.

Then that means they need to stop giving us the option to revive in game too since, when the character dies its &quot;Meant to be dead&quot; kinda lame right? Just saying. Player characters aren't the only ones with the option of a corpse run. :P</div></div><hr />

Now i can say that Blizzard lore devs have no clue about druidism .The worshipping of animal gods (totems) is totally shamanistic<br />
<br />
-First they give Hurricane to druids (lightning spells belong to shamans, WTF)<br />
-They shapeshift because an animal SPIRIT (shaman thing again) gave them the gift to do so, not because of their understanding of nature powers (see bear quest, flying travel form)<br />
-Now they go for the Turtle God, the God of Winged beings and the WOLF God ( ghost wolf+spirit wolves=more shaman stuff)<br />
<br />
Druids are &quot;nature priests&quot; or guardians. Druids take their powers innately from the nature and chemistry, not praising any god<br />
<br />
TLDR: stop ripping stuff that belongs to shamans<br />
<br />
Edit: further reading shows me that there is indeed animals on the Dream, but not intelligent beings</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Years. In Caverns of Time we travel BACK to the Battle of Mount Hyjal, not get teleported straight into an on-going war in the present. The Battle of Mount Hyjal resulted in Teldrassil being grown off the coast of Darkshore, thus it would have to be more than a single year.<br />
<br />

Anyway, this sounds AWESOME, I can't wait for Cataclysm to hit the stores :3</div></div><hr />

Oh yes, because you know everything about their lore, right? ::)<br />
<br />
Seriously, stop believing that everything you do is right, when it's obviously Blizzard themselves who know their lore better than anything. Why is it that Druids have to seek out the Spirits of the animal aspects? There may be more to it than put in game, so just stop it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also... HURRICANE is a nature phenomenon, and last time I checked, Wolves, Winged Creatures and Turtles are pretty close to Nature as well. Just because you want something to be one way, doesn't make it so. Sheesh, just stop it, really.</div></div><hr />

1.) Deathwing swiped at Alex, she's getting rocked backwards.<br />

Clear distinct difference between Shamanism and Druidism. Druids have their shifting powers granted by the spirits from nature. In the case of Nightelves, who have been the dominant race in Druidism on Azeroth, those are the spirits of the bear, the stag, the raven and the frostsaber (cats).<br />
<br />
You call it 'Shamanism', whilst Shamanism is about practising and the praise of the elemental spirits - not the spirits of animals. You are, incorrectly, mixing it up with Trolls, Loa's and the lore revolving around that. Even so, it's still 'just' semantics, the one thing that this lore is clearing up (or trying to tell us, if you will) is that Nightelves and Trolls aren't that much different at all - they even might share some old roots.<br />
<br />
On that note I would like the call out to Blizzard to finally, at long last, make Travel Form a stag. You know it's been meant to be.</div></div><hr />

Dude, shamans work with elements: earth, fire, water, wind etc. Animals have nothing to do about it. Surely you have some aid form a bunch of spirits bound to elements, but it's a secondary link, your &quot;care&quot; about life is only derived from being a &quot;spiritual leader&quot;, just like a hunter cares that his prey is healthy so he can kill it and use it for his people. Shamans do not care how the life feels or willing to learn its secrets, they just want to guide their PEOPLE wisely to take the most profit outta it. Shaman's tribe, ancestors, loyal spirits in service is all that matters to him.<br />
<br />
Druids work with animal and plant kingdoms directly, they care and protect the life itself, they do not use the knowledge to squeeze its riches for some &quot;people&quot;. They can understand the way of shape shifting a lot better than you.</div></div><hr />
