<br />
<br />
Patch 3.2 - PTR Notes Update<br />
The PTR Notes (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html) have been updated to reflect the changes from the latest build. <br />
PvP<br />
Ring of Valor<br />
The flame wall has been removed.<br />
<br />
Ruins of Lordaeron<br />
Two line-of-sight tombstones have been added to the slime pool on the southern side of the map.<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp<br />
Against the Odds: This achievement has been removed and converted to a Feat of Strength.<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
Ulduar<br />
An Immortal Guardian targeted for Empowering Shadows in the Yogg-Saron encounter will now become a 'Marked Immortal Guardian' while targeted.<br />
Crusher Tentacles in the Yogg-Saron encounter spawn a little slower in 25-player mode allowing a bit more time for players to clear out the Illusion room.<br />
Empowering Shadows in the Yogg-Saron encounter now targets a maximum of three Immortal Guardians in 25-player mode.<br />
Yogg-Saron's health has been reduced by 20% in the final stage of his 25-player mode.<br />
<br />
Items: General<br />
Items with Triggered Effects: These items generally have cooldowns on how often they can be triggered. Those cooldowns are now triggered each time the item is equipped (example: A trinket has a 45-second cooldown on an effect triggered by player attacks; when a player equips that item, the effect will be unable to be triggered for the first 45 seconds it is worn).<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=610) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Crusader Aura: This ability now also grants its flying speed increase to a druid's Flight Form and Swift Flight Form.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=660) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman))<br />
A customizable totem bar will now be available for shamans allowing the storing of 4 different totems. These totems can be placed on the ground at once in one global cooldown for the combined mana cost of all 4 totems. The naming scheme of the spells to summon the different totem sets has been changed to make it less confusing for players:<br />
Call of Fire (Totem Bar 1, the first one gained at level 30) is now named Call of the Elements.<br />
Call of Water (Totem Bar 2) is now named Call of the Ancestors.<br />
Call of Fire (Totem Bar 3) is now named Call of the Spirits.<br />
Call of Earth (the spell to recall all summoned totems) is now named Totemic Recall.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=680) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br />
Improved Shadow Bolt: Redesigned slightly. Instead of a 100% chance to apply a 1/2/3/4/5% critical strike increase on the target, it now has a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to apply a 5% critical strike increase.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=600) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warrior))<br />
Devastate: Weapon damage and bonus per Sunder Armor on the target increased by 100%.<br />
<br />
Bug Fixes<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight<br />
Anti-Magic Shell: The tooltip for this ability will now reflect modifications from the Magic Suppression talent.<br />

Desecration: No longer causes unnecessary combat logging.<br />
Horn of Winter: Learning rank 2 of this ability caused players to unlearn rank 1, such that it no longer appears in their spellbook. It is now possible to relearn that rank, and death knights will no longer &quot;forget&quot; rank 1 when they learn rank 2.<br />
Lichborne: The buff from this ability can now be cancelled.<br />
Raise Ally: Using the Gnaw ability while under the effects of this spell will now initiate auto-attack. In addition, the damage done has been changed from a flat value to a percentage of weapon damage.<br />

Summon Gargoyle: Corrected the inaccurate tooltip which claimed a Gargoyle could last up to 40 seconds, when in fact 30 seconds has always been the maximum.<br />
Rune of Razorice: Corrected a bug where this applied to frost damage done by others.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Bash: Tooltip now specifies that the Interrupt effect only occurs on non-player targets.<br />
Bear Form, Cat Form, and Dire Bear Form: Mana energizes that occur while in these forms will now appear in the combat log and floating combat text.<br />

All ranks of Sonic Blast now properly have an 80 Focus cost.<br />
Black Arrow Ranks 5 and 6 training costs have been lowered significantly.<br />

<br />

Exorcism: Now properly has a 100% chance to be a critical strike when cast on death knights using Lichborne.<br />
Eye for an Eye: Now properly triggered by periodic critical strikes. In addition, the tooltip incorrectly stated that 20% damage is reflected, when it is actually 10%. Tooltip fixed.<br />

Mind Flay: This spell will now work correctly with [target=focus] macros.<br />
Pain Suppression: No longer can be cast while under the effects of Incapacitate or Cyclone.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />

Immolate and Unstable Affliction: All ranks of these two spells will now overwrite each other.<br />
Improved Imp: Each time an Imp is summoned it will recast Blood Pact (if autocast is on), forcing it to benefit from this talent, even if the Imp was not summoned at the time the talent was learned.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior<br />

Most of this game was made and designed before TBC even came out, they have not really a single thing. All those items/spells..you mean just the recolored ones used a million times? Amazing locations? Like all those hallways...and circular hallways?</div></div><hr />

I mean look at the corset on the druid / rogue gear. They also get good looking shoulder backpacks to make it look that much better.<br />

And just wow at the amazing detail of the plate pieces, I will put pride into the fact that I have a sword on my chest rather than all of those other terrible looking emblems on theother plate pieces.<br />

Arguments like this I fail to understand. People act like sharing models is a new thing. As many have pointed out, there have been plenty of item sets that share looks (AQ, Sunwell, right off the top of my head). Even the non-set epics share models (Paladin T8 = Epic plate shoulder graphics). This isn't new, so at least they look good.<br />
<br />
About the Alliance beak thing, for the love of God people, they're all &quot;Alliance&quot; themed. Anyone notice that one of their main symbols is a gryphon? Personally, I think it adds some character. +5 Blizz.</div></div><hr />

Not really... it only stands out against the DK and Warrior skins of the same gear because the BElf is lankier and the colors are red and gold, a huge contrast to the colder darker black DK/Warr skins.<br />

Technically, Alliance shaman would have a unique set as well (They just didnt use the Draenei when showcasing it).<br />

The Horde Pally set looks unique because only Belves can use it but its actually the same model as the DK and Warrior set with just a different texture map/color scheme</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Why are you so angry? You're basically the only person in here insulting other people's taste.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I get what Blizzard is trying to do with the same looking armor sets, how we are all supposed to be an united army getting ready to assault Arthas...but really, could they not have added at least some details to different sets other than different colors? Couldn't they have added a little variation?<br />
<br />
Also, you guys really think these sets look good? They aren't horrible...but they are so bland, especially the Alliance sets. At least the T7 recolors were somewhat vibrant and cool to look at.<br />
<br />
<br />
I kind of agree with you here. I think having some more noticeable details would have been nice, but I kind of believe that the toned down idea was on purpose. If you're facing a group of people, would you immediately try to kill the guy wearing an all gray jumpsuit, or the guy in huge, bright gold armor that glows like a second sun? Chances are you'll do the ladder. This way, every person in their 'unit' will be barely noticeable from their members. <br />
<br />

Alliance leather is very much on par with the &quot;time period&quot; they are trying to portray. During the medievil period leather clothes were stiched together just like in the t9 art we see. It's vintage. I don't find anything wrong with it, except for the beak? on the helm...makes no sense. <br />
Well, at least I can hide it.<br />
Of all the sets, the leather, esp. the chest, is probably most consistent with what light armor &quot;back in the day&quot; looked like.<br />
Think about it, before all the LOLOLOLOL<br />

Wow can you people not grasp that... we're complaining because it's BULLSHIT to use in anything. They have the manpower and certainly have the time to design a handful of nice looking gear. Every other MMO does, why can't they? Just saying &quot;Well they've done it before&quot; DOESN'T MAKE IT RIGHT. holy shit, wrap your heads around that for a second. ::)<br />
<br />
<br />
When people start cussing in threads, I smile on the inside. It's like, &quot;Hey, I can't really have a normal conversation, and since I must be right, I'll throw out something that'll make me sound tough...hmm...but what to use...&quot;<br />
<br />
Anyways, you are incorrect on this statement. Last time I checked, Everquest (original) didn't have different looking sets. If you were a plate wearing human, your armor looked the exact same as another plate wearing human (even when they reworked the graphics in Luclin, they still were the same). Guild Wars used the same graphics for many different sets. I haven't played either game in a very long time, so these facts might have changed.<br />
<br />
Anyways, why do people feel like they have to stand out in order to enjoy themselves? Honestly, the new sets could be checker boards if they had the stats I needed. Game play / content &gt; graphics. This is why I still play Super Mario Brothers on my NES.</div></div><hr />

That's a good point for the people arguing the whole &quot;uniform&quot; aspect. The horde ones are quite varied in color compared to Alliance. They appear to have more graphical effects as well, such as the mage/lock/priest shoulders and the shaman/hunter shoulders, versus the bland alliance stuff. The horde leather looks like something from T1/2 though, which I find interesting. Picture a resto druid in that gear. Then again, they're probably in treeform.<br />
<br />
Horde wins this round.</div></div><hr />

I really most of them, but the alliance leather is so damn funny. And yeah this is like the lancelot age, I expect when we'll reach 3.3 every class is going to have atleast 1 skull on their armor set :D</div></div><hr />

Don't really understand these people that are literally crying their eyes out because they don't like their sets. &quot;Riflemancho&quot; is a good example of one of the retards who will be crying himself to sleep tonight about these models even though I would hazzard a guess his Naxx guild won't be getting anywhere near this loot no matter how easy Blizzard try to make it :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
In complete honesty, can someone tell me why there is a huge base of players that feels Blizzard is no longer putting in any effort into WoW? I've been playing for 3.5 years, and I feel as though there is far more content in the game now then there was back when 'they cared'. Sure, there are expansions in play that weren't around back then, but we're being given new raid zones, an evolving storyline, more dailies, more reasons to play alts, pretty much a lot of stuff.<br />
<br />
I think I need to write down all of the people who believe Blizz is getting lazy with armor, and watch their reactions when T10 is released. I have faith in the company.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
SMB has more content then most games out right now and the graphics are still good. All that 3d shit is boring in the Mario world and screws with the game. And last I checked, Lineage II, FFXI, Aion and other games all gave us nice looking gear. Sure they reused some of it sometimes, but then they came back and gave us nice looking pieces. Blizzard has a total of TWO things to design, the helm and the shoulder pads, because all the other parts are just textures painted onto your character. And yet they still can't design interesting looking gear for each class. Oh and gameplay/content &gt; Graphics? Yeah, a lot of content in this 3.2 patch I can tell you, what with all the reskinned bosses? The lack of lore? The boring fights? ::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually I'll go further to say that these are the best tier sets every designed. Look at the detail in these textures. I don't understand why people are saying they look bad, they look imba. The alliance rogue especially looks amazing. With the non-tier parts it will look even better.<br />
<br />
Obviously they don't look as good as Bloodfang or Frostfire (T3) but certainly better than the rest.</div></div><hr />

I can imagine a male human wearing the shit. its almost as bad as the bird man suit they tried to pass as rogue t9. Ours is pretty horrible too but not nearly as embarassing to wear and laughable as the ally leather. I could see it being nice on a druid but on a rogue...... no just...no.</div></div><hr />

By that time all set gear will be converted into one-piece feety-pajamas, so that way there isn't any polygonal building involved. It will also be colored black, since it is the default color on most imaging software color palettes and the color wont need to be changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've never played Lineage II or FFXI, so I can't comment on their armor designs. I was just saying WoW isn't the only game that reuses armor graphics. They tend to not do it much more than other games.<br />
<br />
I can see your point about content, if you look at it from a patch to patch basis. I view WotLK as a whole xpac, meaning 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 are all part of the same box. If you batch them together, then yes, we're getting a lot of content here. If you're going patch to patch, maybe not so much.<br />
<br />
Again, about helm and shoulder design, I'd save those comments till your T10 comes out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, creating a video game of this scope is difficult. Yes, WoW is still one of the (if not the) best MMOs out there. Yes, I will continue to play it. But I am left scratching my head about a few things this patch is bringing out that I simply do not understand.<br />
<br />
First: The Tier 9 gear is, in my opinion at least, pretty hideous looking across the board. The best I can offer for any of the models I've seen is that it &quot;doesn't look bad&quot;. But the single MOST disappointing feature about the new armor is that its design is just flat, plain-old lazy. What do we have here? 1 new model per class of armor (cloth, leather, mail and plate)? Honestly, Blizzard - is that REALLY the best you can do? Is that all we can hope to ask for, that 2-3 classes will now look practically identical? If you are truly running out of ideas for how to make the classes look unique, hire some blasted fashion designers to come in and consult. They make some pretty wacky things to display on those catwalks... I'm sure they could come up with something for you.<br />
<br />
Second: The new dungeon and raid content. Glorified Pit of Blood and a rogues' gallery of NPCs we've already seen. Bravo. This one is right up there with recycling Naxx for us to headline the expansion.<br />
<br />
But what puzzles me more than how obviously hastily thrown together this whole tier was is WHY it is being jammed down our throats NOW. Ulduar was a pretty impressive piece of work (itemization aside) and MOST of the raiding world is still working its way through the content. Okay, so most serious guilds have downed Yogg, but how many have completed Yogg +0? 5? If THIS trash is all you can throw together, why even release it at all?<br />
<br />
I would love to hear some explanation on this from the folks at Blizzard, and guys - save the whining about how hard it is to please everyone and keep the game balanced... You phoned in the content additions for 3.2. That isn't up for discussion. What I want to know, is why?</div></div><hr />

I also liked the T8 rogue set. Very symbolic, and a way to distinguish WoW rogues from the generic rogue/thief/pickpocket fantasy stereotype.<br />
<br />
I find it highly amusing (and also, somewhat sad) that so many guys are being embarrassed about what they'll be &quot;wearing&quot; as an ally Rogue or Druid. As a woman, I can wear pants these days without being ridiculed...nobody will blink twice. I could even wear a fancy pantsuit to a party, instead of a dress or skirt. Nobody would care. Nobody would accuse me of being out of line, or a dyke, or anything. But you poor men keep supporting dress and fashion biases among yourselves (trust me, women appreciate a well-dressed male). The Druid and Rogue leather is beautiful, but you're all too scared/biased/steeped in western male culture to keep an open mind about it. It's kinda sad to see as an outside perspective as a female. Woman's emancipation has progressed quite far, and the world hasn't yet fallen apart due to it, but men are still trapping themselves with their attitudes about what is &quot;manly&quot; and what &quot;isn't&quot;. (OMG, my friends will laugh at me! QQ! Really, you give a flying fuck about what your friends think? That's how you make your decisions? Wow, that's so...high school female cliquish! Which I despise, in either gender. Just as I despite male gossip as much as I do female gossip.)<br />
<br />
/end being randomly philosophical. (Yeah, this isn't the best place to speak about it...I know. ::sad face::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And also... rogue alread used that kind of mask in TBC sets.<br />
<br />
Alliance sets are good, except for mail ones (looks more like a Druid). They made the leather sets really look like what they are: Leather.<br />
<br />
Horde sets looks good too, except for leather ones (didn't like the &quot;looks like old time plate&quot; look). Paladin really improved without the green spikes, but overall the horde plates look weaker than alliance model and plates overall. Not that much &quot;heavy armored&quot; and I was looking foward to something like it for horde (Warrior's T6 anyone?).<br />
<br />
Overall, finally going back to not every set looking like plate.</div></div><hr />

Worst shaman set currently in the entire game, its a cheaper and worse looking ripoff of tier 1.<br />
<br />
oh well, nothing that cant be fixed by replacing the game files for T9 with those for T2, the best looking shaman set ever made.<br />
<br />
But really, how does it fit into the logic of ANYONE that the highest level gear in the game looks so bad one wouldnt wear it just to spare the eyes? Stop fucking around blizz!<br />
And if youre really so horrible you have to recycle the Tier 6 set for warriors, why on earth do you then make it look worse than the set youre copying???</div></div><hr />

All that 3d shit is boring in the Mario world and screws with the game. And last I checked, Lineage II, FFXI, Aion and other games all gave us nice looking gear. Sure they reused some of it sometimes, but then they came back and gave us nice looking pieces. Blizzard has a total of TWO things to design, the helm and the shoulder pads, because all the other parts are just textures painted onto your character. And yet they still can't design interesting looking gear for each class. Oh and gameplay/content &gt; Graphics? Yeah, a lot of content in this 3.2 patch I can tell you, what with all the reskinned bosses? The lack of lore? The boring fights? ::)<br />
<br />
<br />

Lock and priest gear should not basically look the same given a slight color change. Not knocking the art dept (me being a professional artist myself), they are probably cranking out some pretty bad assed designs but they are not being implemented into the game. Epic armor should look very unique and epic to the class it has been made for, especially for all the work that goes into acquiring it. Blizzard makes 11 million+ dollars a month off this game, there is no reason why they cannot at the least provide better armor designs that do not look like a rip off of another class in game. In vanilla wow we had some fantastic armor designs that preached to the class it was intended for, now a few expansions and millions of dollars later instead of the designs getting better they sadly have gotten extremely lazy.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abremm</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 10:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i think people need to think about a couple things when looking at these sets, and see them in the context of the game:<br />
<br />
#1, this gear is not boss dropped, its not some hidden treasure locked away for the the last thousand years, it is armor being produced by the argent crusade for the specific purpose of equipping a team of champions to face off with Arthas. <br />
<br />
#2 on the &quot;omg one model for each armor type? WTF?!&quot; comments... normaly there are 10 sets for 10 classes, if they did that for this patch, they would need to make 20 different sets (10alliance/10horde) that are each unique and special in thier own right and up to the usual quality standard. that is really asking alot, imo. so i think its perfectly reasonable that they went with 8 different models with 20 different skins.<br />
<br />
given those two points, i have no problem at all with these sets. they fit the context very well, and if making 8 sets with 20 skins means they can spend more time on ICC, then more power to them. <br />
<br />
this patch is obviously a mid-expansion gear reset to get people ready for ICC, they did the same thing in TBC. i think its a great idea to keep the player base together.</div></div><hr />

WRONG, I got banned for replying to a thread about how one guy was disappointed on the new set, I added my 2 cents saying how I felt they rushed it, I didnt get banned for saying that but for bumping a 2 day old thread, basically they used that as an excuse to get me banned, its got nothing to do with being an asshole.</div></div><hr />

And they have an excuse to be alittle lazy this time around, its not like we're getting these legendary pieces of gear from some mystical treasure chest... we're kickin around things/beings our faction randomly collected, and getting rewarded straight from the armories. <br />

<br />
Raise the god damn corset and attach sleeves, give druids legs instead of another damn kilt (wtb back T4 days where I could look good on a mount... ¬_¬) then remove the hood from the helm, let us keep the bird beak part, then make some awesome BoE/emblem boots with buckles, let Druids use 1 handed sword, and then call Droods and Rogues pirates.<br />
<br />
Because THAT would be awesome.<br />
<br />
Personally as a druid, even teh little time I spend in night elf form&lt; I don't wanna go round wearing some crap corset dress thing with a hood. I look like im trying to pull superheros ¬_¬<br />
<br />
Or atleast give the hood like pointy up ears so we can say: LAWL IM NITEOWL, then i'll go moonkin form and say: LOLZ ME 2.<br />
<br />
<br />
And yes I agree, hunters set looks more like a druids set.<br />

Ulduar was a pretty impressive piece of work (itemization aside) and MOST of the raiding world is still working its way through the content. Okay, so most serious guilds have downed Yogg, but how many have completed Yogg +0? 5? If THIS trash is all you can throw together, why even release it at all?<br />

Perhaps T9 will be a reflection of this - some kind of Argent Crusade created gear for play in their arena?<br />

It makes bosses less likely to go after the healers cuz they see the spikes, stop and go back to mashing the tank because he has less of them and thus it will hurt the bosses hands less.</div></div><hr />

(http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?shaman))<br />
A customizable totem bar will now be available for shamans allowing the storing of 4 different totems. These totems can be placed on the ground at once in one global cooldown for the combined mana cost of all 4 totems. The naming scheme of the spells to summon the different totem sets has been changed to make it less confusing for players:<br />
Call of Fire (Totem Bar 1, the first one gained at level 30) is now named Call of the Elements.<br />
Call of Water (Totem Bar 2) is now named Call of the Ancestors.<br />
Call of Fire (Totem Bar 3) is now named Call of the Spirits.<br />
Call of Earth (the spell to recall all summoned totems) is now named Totemic Recall.<br />
<br />
<br />
i mean really. if you are playing this game and simple wording confuses you about what they do and you can't read the tooltip that says it find a new game. can't believe that players especially ones that play a shaman and the tooltip said call of water drops asigned totem set confused anyone. and the tooltip for call of earth said recall all totems was omg confusing. oh well the new ones will work just as well, just stupid that somebody can't read and probably thought it would drop all the fire.water.earth totems etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
have you been under a rock for the past month. we all know that the sets are going to look the same. they are for the colusiem event where our rewards are from the alliance and the horde, not some dk, machine, etc from an instance. the sets look the same as others have mentioned over the past few weeks to resemble more of a army or faction, or team. whatever you want to call it its to make us look uniform.<br />
<br />
while this is not the most impressive tier set it has its highs and lows. its is also put in as a gear catch up for those just coming back or not really doing ulduar. its in place for 3.3 to go live. they want everyone to see it and they want it when it goes live.<br />
<br />
besides, when it comes to best in slot, usually no more than 2 tier items make the list if any at all. and with the minimal upgrade some of them are from T8 you will probably only wear it if you do the 25man heroic.</div></div><hr />

Thing is a lot of people have been saying WHY the sets are poor and what needs to be changed. I know that even though I don't have a priest or a lock if I DID have on or both of them, i'd be pretty naffed off the only difference between the alliance armor sets its a bit of shoulder re-coloration and a slightly darker skirt. While mages get a nice shiny light blue one, heck, would it have been so hard to make priests white and gold? No, not really. Infact definately not, 5 minutes on photoshop with the game texture. Max.</div></div><hr />

Makes one wonder, did they miss the memo that frost has already been killed off in arenas and they're keeping on beating on a corpse that's grown cold a while ago?<br />
<br />
Classic case of left arm not knowing what right arm is doing.</div></div><hr />

I play horde priest and honestly couldn't care. Our cloth sets look amazing.</div></div><hr />

You change the red tones in the armor to black, and then you change the red of the glowing eyes to blue to keep it more in theme with the WotLK.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm appalled that you'd even bring such a possibility up!<br />
Rogue T2 is by far the ugliest set that is currently in the game IMO<br />
The Anh'Qiraj space suits come close, but not as bad. But then again this is just my opinion.<br />
<br />
Enough people complained when they recolored t4, t5, t6 and recently t3. I don't think redoing t2 would bring in positive praise.</div></div><hr />

Mwhaa also whats up with thy laziness Blizz!? only 8 totally different looking sets and 20 somewhat different. You were so much more creative back then, I mean just look at the 2.2 patch notes! http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_2.2.0<br />
<br />
To be honest, sets are fine, better than most of the sets out there but worse than the awesome Ulduar sets.</div></div><hr />

I'm not normally one to QQ - I like most of Blizzards choices. I think Ulduar was a greatly designed epic raid actually. I really think its a huge shame that the new tier of content, what is going to replace all that gear and all that work, is one room consisting of like 6 bosses. Seriously ... 6?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogue t2 (ugliest set in the game)<br />
Druid t1+2<br />
Paladin t1<br />
Priest t1<br />
<br />
You'll feel much better about these &quot;shitty&quot; looking sets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you just seriously say that Druid T2 Stormrage set is worse than this??<br />
And Rogue T2?<br />

man. what kind of stuff are you on?</div></div><hr />

<br />
the designers have no ideas, what they can create as content until the new mmo will release, so blizzard do the best they can do - they recycle all things.<br />
<br />
Only the T9-sets are so non-creative (one set for each armor class and faction).<br />
<br />
no, wow is definetly dead, and wotlk was the last addon.</div></div><hr />
