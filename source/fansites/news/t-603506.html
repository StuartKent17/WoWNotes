Season 3 in Europe 
Time for european players to experience the wonderful season 3 downtime. Keep in mind that you can go in Nagrand and Blade's Edge arenas, as well as in the town of Gadgetzan to avoid the crowd in Area 52 when you try to buy your new equipment. If everything goes well the server alert bot will be on #mmo-champion on irc.quakenet.org to warn players as soon as realms are online.

Season 3 in Europe<br />
Time for european players to experience the wonderful season 3 downtime. Keep in mind that you can go in Nagrand and Blade's Edge arenas, as well as in the town of Gadgetzan to avoid the crowd in Area 52 when you try to buy your new equipment. If everything goes well the server alert bot will be on <br />
#mmo-champion on irc.quakenet.org (irc://irc.quakenet.org/mmo-champion) to warn players as soon as realms are online.<br />
This Wednesday there will be a scheduled maintenance. Please note that all European realms will be offline from 05:00 until 11:00, Paris time (CET).<br />
Some realms will be undergoing extended maintenance. The following realms will be offline from 3:00 until 11:00, Paris time (CET): <br />
Alonsus<br />
Anachronos<br />
Darkmoon Faire<br />
Darkspear<br />
Burning Steppes<br />
Bronze Dragonflight<br />
Kor'gall<br />
Lightbringer<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Due to the maintenance our website (e.g. forums and account administration) will not be available from 3:00 until 6:00, Paris time (CET).<br />
<br />
Season 3 Bugs<br />
New season, same bugs. I guess it's pretty hard to fix something on season changes, it's not like it happens very often. <br />
We're aware of reports from players that the incorrect Season 2 titles have been awarded, and we're currently investigating these claims. Until we have a better idea of what the issue is, what the cause is, and what a possible fix is, we're unable to make any further comments of any substance.<br />
<br />
Rest assured we're investigating.<br />
<br />
We're also aware that the Season 2 Nether Drakes were not sent out, but instead the Season 1 Nether Drakes were sent in their place. We're waiting for a final conclusion on the title issue before we make any decisions on the drake issue and ultimately send out the Season 2 drakes.<br />
<br />
Vindicator gear replacing Veteran<br />
I forgot to mention it in the FAQ, and I guess it's a good addition for people who couldn't check it by themselves yet. (Yes, you can still get the rings)<br />
The Season 1 (previously called Gladiator, now called Vindicator) items can be found where honor items can always be found, in the champion's hall of Stormwind and Orgrimmar.<br />
<br />
The new Vindicator items are fully replacing the old Veteran's items, except for the rings.</div></div><hr />

Getting a bit pissed of on all this delays. <br />
What is the problem??<br />
<br />
I m surprised that a company that makes money on 9 million accounts X12 euro = 108 million Euro / month and cant do anything on time and correct from the start. <br />
(And i counted LOW it is 12.99 euro/month.. just incase + all new players in china so i guess it maybe is 10 million ppl + . )<br />
<br />
Do something right for once! GG Blizzard ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have tons of screenshots that proves my team were ranked 10 (2v2) at the entire Vindication BG, which is a fairly small one, so only 25 teams (5000 teams in total) should get the Gladiator-title and mount. We dropped to rank 16 due to boosters when the realms went off. At least we should've gotten Duelist title if not Gladiator, but no, no title. That was 2373 rating in 2v2; Challenger title. I got Challenger in S1 with 1900 rating, ranked 1k or something. &gt;_&gt;<br />

arenajunkies suggests 15th as the cutoff point for Gladiator.</div></div><hr />

Besides, I somewhat refuse to believe there's 1700 teams in the Vindication battleground that hasn't played 20 matches and doesn't have one person with 20% attendancy in them. o_o<br />
<br />
Besides, it also predicted a rating of 2338, which is way off, we're 50 above it.</div></div><hr />

The main problem is that there is like 1 or 2 on Bloodfeather that got the drake, tons of players that had enuff for gladiator didn't get it.<br />
<br />
Any idea of when EU is getting titles and drakes fixed? :D</div></div><hr />
