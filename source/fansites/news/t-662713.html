WoW Teaser on Soundblaster.com<br />
A new teaser appeared on the front page of SoundBlaster.com (http://www.soundblaster.com/). For the moment it's just a blinking horde logo with the Lament of the Highborne (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/movies.html#lament) playing in the background. I don't think Blizzard would announce anything important through another site and it's most likely just a nice way to release a new piece of hardware but we'll keep an eye on it anyway.<br />

Credit to Jester1257 for increasing the lighting.<br />
<br />
We can easily see Azshara in this pic, and the Eastern Kingdoms on the right.<br />
<br />
My theory as the days progress: The image will both get brighter and the map will extend outwards so we can get the full view of the map.<br />
Once Blizzcon hits, we will be hit with a surprise.. possibly the destructive wake of the Cataclysm visible on the map.</div></div><hr />

Before the Diablo 3 announcement on the WWI there was this splash screen that was updated once per day with more symbols/hints etc until the day of the announcement. <br />
<br />
Flash files here being named day1.swf sort of brings all of that back</div></div><hr />

if it is really just about a WoW themed headset (and not a WoW CataclyxnsdnsjdbyouknowwhatImean themed headset) people will be VERY dissapointed. you don't want to dissapoint people when you're trying to sell them stuff.<br />
with blizzcon coming in a few days, this can't be coincidence either (unless soundblaster is really stupid ;) )</div></div><hr />

Well, it's not exactly their fault if people are putting words into their mouths. Nowhere does it say it's Cataclysm related, if people are expecting otherwise and it isn't, that's their own problem</div></div><hr />

The pieces of the maps shown in the luminated screenshot are identical to the existing map. Are you really that blind with hype? As much as I believe mmo-champion's assumptions are correct... some of you people really grasp for straws, and see what you want to see. These &quot;missing pieces&quot; are gradients, fading it into the background. Good lord people.<br />
<br />
Blizzard WOULD NOT do this through Creative. This is Creative sparking gossip, and garnering traffic for their site (traffic = money in the world of adsense). They're basically yet another pirhana, feeding off this hype frenzy. And the retarded are feeding into it. Good job, Creative's marketing department.<br />
<br />
Not only that, handing over the updated map to a company that has zero affiliation with Activision/Blizzard... is not a good thing to do. All you're doing is risking leaks. Do you really think everyone adhere to NDA's? A lot of people out there would rather be publicized.</div></div><hr />

and yeh, as other have said, you can clearly see the (really big) maelstrom swirling behind the logo.<br />

betting it'll get brighter, and the logo more see-through over the next few weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
that's not your train of thought if you work in advertising (and it shouldn't be if you want to be successful)<br />
<br />
it is soundblasters problem because they'll lose potential customers due to them connecting the brand with the dissapointement created when Cataclysm turned out to be a shallow hype. and with those rumours on mmo champ and blizzcon coming in just a few days, that's probably &gt;90% of the people visting their site right now.<br />
<br />
either soundblaster and blizzard are indeed working together and it is about a Maelstrom (Lament of the Highborne) expansion.<br />
or this is a very, very bad move that'll dent soundblasters image and blizzard's aswell to a certain amount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Though in my personal opinion it looks as though they will time it with the new expansion announcement or atleast Blizzcon. Totaly see the text around the inside part of the metalic looking bit to end up being the expansion name or a WoW quote or something. People need to be less orientated about the map at the back, it is definately a standard game map, there is no coastal fading or diminishing and it does not show anything about a flood. It's there for decoration, majority of people wont even notice it!</div></div><hr />

<br />
you have to wait like 2-5min for the movie to load.<br />
imo it has nothing to do with the cataclysm, it's a WoW headset.<br />
And to hype blizzcon etc etc they have it on the map and maelstrom.</div></div><hr />

as you can see Azeroth itself has not changed.<br />
<br />
the only thing I am skeptical about the background color of the malestorm and the patterns in the sea.<br />
<br />
where in the game a blue background is selected, it is not blue but yellow. approximately the yellow which is is also present at the land.<br />

<br />
It is definately, one hundred percent, a new headset. <br />
<br />
Though in my personal opinion it looks as though they will time it with the new expansion announcement or atleast Blizzcon. Totaly see the text around the inside part of the metalic looking bit to end up being the expansion name or a WoW quote or something. People need to be less orientated about the map at the back, it is definately a standard game map, there is no coastal fading or diminishing and it does not show anything about a flood. It's there for decoration, majority of people wont even notice it! <br />
<br />
<br />
People see what they want to see. :)</div></div><hr />

What I find odd about this is how Kalimdor's bottom half is oddly not shown as well as Eastern Kingdoms. That's very peculiar that they wouldn't have at least a bit more of the Barrens showing. You could make the case that it doesn't matter and that they're just focusing on two Horde areas, but that also doesn't make sense because they can easily do the same on the right side.<br />

Lazy blurring or something more?!<br />

Why? I guess because there will be Gilneas + Kultiras i guess... but dunno :)<br />

The 2 portions of the map in the picture are a representation of &quot;The Cataclysm&quot;.<br />

On the left it displays Azshara, which is giving the hint at 'Queen Azshara'? A possible zone change? etc etc.<br />

On the right however we can clearly see a scene of the 'Tirisfal Glades'....possibly to state the return of the Guardian? Krasus' Grove? The landing zone of the Highborne upon Azeroth?<br />

Could it be that Blizzard has invited their partners to take part in the build up? And soundblaster.com jumped the gun a day early or something? <br />
<br />
Otherwise this is soundblaster just building hype over wow themed headphones or something. A move that will ultimately disappoint some players but will still succeed in gaining some serious name-recognition... there is no such thing as bad publicity, as they say.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The map used in the flash file is exactly the same as the in-game map. Of course there's shaded out bits, blurs added, colored textures, etc... They were editing the image to fit with their flash design. Chill out.<br />
<br />
Hell, looking at the flash... the metallic, circular design in the center with the horde symbol clearly resembles the ear piece of a headset. If you look, you'll see it. Imagine a new headset with a flashy, little horde symbol on the ear piece.<br />
<br />
And another point, which has already been made, Blizzard would not give sensitive information pertaining to new game releases to a third party company. They would, however, allow said company to enter in an advertisement partnership to help promote the release of their new hardware in time with Blizzard's new expansion announcement. It could even be that Blizzard is heading up the promotional design for Soundblaster's new WoW related headset campaign in coalition with their countdown to announcing Cataclysm. It makes sense. Both companies stand to gain from the attention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ugh.... Its NOT a WoW headset. Ive never seen a headset with no speakers... or not end. It's a ring of some sort that I believe to be some kind of plot device to who will be the last boss in the CC (Im going to abbreviate Cataclysm.) or who the greater evil will be.<br />
<br />
The 4 islands on the in game map when zoomed all the way out is interesting, but I doubt that it will be the Goblin's starting area, since the factions tend to have an equal number of cities for the races on each continent.<br />
<br />
Why is the area where Durotar is suppose to start faded? Isn't it speculated that Durotar will be flooded, or destroyed. A statement about this can be made without physically editing the map.<br />
<br />
The symbols flying around are not broken up pieces of the horde symbol, their the symbols from the Inscription Runes, you know, the ones you buff your abilities with?<br />
<br />
The horde symbol confuses me, why Horde and not Alliance? I think it is because of Garrosh Hellscream, and all the speculated things about the Horde till now.<br />
<br />
The yellow behind the Maelstrom just suggests emphasis on that area. That in turn leads me to believe that this is indeed linked to Blizzards copy writing to the name &quot;Cataclysm&quot; which most likely could be the new wow expansion.</div></div><hr />

Those are the Broken Isles ( The place where Sargeras's Tomb is located, not too mention where Gul'dan and most of the Stormreaver Clan were slain)<br />
<br />
The Isles are known too be constantly shifting around the Maelstrom in a clockwise manner, i doubt they have been implemented into the old map as of yet....expect it in the updated version :)</div></div><hr />

But sir, this is a creative headset. (and to clarify: i doubt soundblaster is copying creatives design)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">biozork</div><div class="date">2009-08-18, 05:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have carefully read the posts in this thread, and I cant seem to find anyone writing about the song shortly played in the flash. Other than noted in the OP.<br />
<br />
The song is called &quot;Lament of the Highborne&quot;, known to most from the questline, that ends with the song performed by Sylvanas Windrunner (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/downloads/movies.html#lament).<br />
The original version is a Kaldorei (night elves) song lamenting the losses during the War of the Ancients (http://www.wowwiki.com/War_of_the_Ancients).<br />
The War of the Ancients is a conflict that rocked ancient Azeroth some ten thousand years prior to the First War. It started when the reckless Highborne drew the attention of Sargeras and his Burning Legion, and was ended, after massive casualties, when the Well of Eternity blasted the supercontinent of Kalimdor apart. This event is called &quot;The Great Sundering (http://www.wowwiki.com/Great_Sundering)&quot; or Cataclysm.<br />
http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/wowwiki/images/a/a6/Great_Sundering.jpg<br />
(http://www.wowwiki.com/File:Great_Sundering.jpg)<br />
The site of the Well of Eternity became a swirling vortex of power known as the Maelstrom. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it just me, or is this too much of a coincidence that it is a song that can be directly related to Cataclysm?<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">draget2004</div><div class="date">2009-08-18, 06:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unfortunately from the look of the the circle that the horde logo is in has a very shiny plastic look, plus it has the two etches on either side that is similar to most headphones (my radioshack ones have similar cuts).<br />
<br />
I think the reason why the bottom of durotar is cut off, and below Silverpine is cut off is because that's where it says Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms, and since this is a third party website that doesn't have access to blank maps vs maps with locations on them they had to edit out the bottoms.<br />
<br />
One thing i did notice is that the video file is called &quot;ML.Swf&quot;.<br />
<br />
ML could either stand for Maelstrom or it could stand for Major League (as in Major League Gaming, if these are new gaming headphones.)<br />

<br />
The 4 islands on the in game map when zoomed all the way out is interesting, but I doubt that it will be the Goblin's starting area, since the factions tend to have an equal number of cities for the races on each continent.<br />
<br />
Why is the area where Durotar is suppose to start faded? Isn't it speculated that Durotar will be flooded, or destroyed. A statement about this can be made without physically editing the map.<br />
<br />
The symbols flying around are not broken up pieces of the horde symbol, their the symbols from the Inscription Runes, you know, the ones you buff your abilities with?<br />
<br />
The horde symbol confuses me, why Horde and not Alliance? I think it is because of Garrosh Hellscream, and all the speculated things about the Horde till now.<br />
<br />
The yellow behind the Maelstrom just suggests emphasis on that area. That in turn leads me to believe that this is indeed linked to Blizzards copy writing to the name &quot;Cataclysm&quot; which most likely could be the new wow expansion. <br />

You don't know SHIT. Boubouille's posts are accurate and always new and refreshing. Goddamn, you're goddamn ignorant aren't you? This isn't &quot;anything for clicks&quot; fuckface. This is present time news motherfudger. This is information pre-blizzcon, which is valid.<br />
<br />
I hate you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Qrio</div><div class="date">2009-08-18, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have a deja-vu, and no - not about last year's WWI teasers about Diablo. <br />
<br />
I have a deja-vu from 2 weeks ago when Boub was sure that the new patch will hit that week. Hundreds of posts were written to claim how wrong he is, how he doesn't know anything and he's just doing this for the clicks. Hundreds of posts were written to say that &quot;amg they can't release a patch without the arena season to close! Boub is corrupted and wants visitors! He fell so low that he has to resort to deception and blatant lies to attract visitors&quot;. <br />
<br />
Guess what, next day these guys disappeared. They laid lower than the grass for about a week, until he posted the &quot;preview&quot; of Cataclysm. These same guys started reappearing and attacking again.<br />
<br />
I'm not on anyone's side, and I want for once Boub to be wrong so he can run in Paris naked, but certainly for this thing I want him to be right. Just to mess up with the heads of everyone claiming he does this for the clicks.</div></div><hr />

I highlighted the ally logo. There are similar &quot;runes&quot; on the horde pic too.<br />
Can any1 find anything? :D like the letters of &quot;Cataclysm&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
That this was just something for new hardware seemed rather obvious to me. <br />
If it realy was about something in-game related, it would have been on the WoW sites like the diablo thing.<br />
<br />

Considering the vector quality of the design I'm making an educated guess this is the first look at the new expansion logo. (taken from the .swf directly)</div></div><hr />

Auto-quoting : <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Look at the damn animation, ffs. See the headset-like shape, in a headset-like metal gray color ?<br />
Oh damn you're right, everything points to the Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now it would be possible to quote everybody who was so hyped by this simply well-timed flash animation, and I could even quote the pople mocking my post. But I guess it's no use, the shame is already there.</div></div><hr />

Might be revealed at a certain con sometime soon?<br />
<br />
Superb marketing by blizzard and creative. <br />
<br />
Would not doubt one milisec that blizzard have briefed creative about what will create the most amount of hype. Business is business.<br />
<br />
Would love to know how many hits creative had on their site since they posted that..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Madmushroom</div><div class="date">2009-08-18, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On a side note of speculating, taken from blizzplanet:<br />
<br />
The hints of an upcoming cataclysm to be provoked by Cho&#8217;gall and his Twilight&#8217;s Hammer who wish to free the Old gods.<br />
and from wowwiki:<br />
<br />
Cho'gall escaped to southern Kalimdor, where he took shelter within the chamber of C'Thun deep inside the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj.<br />
While the Lich King attacked Stormwind City and Orgrimmar and King Varian Wrynn and Warchief Thrall were distracted,<br />
Cho'gall began the resurrection of his new master - the Old God C'Thun. This deformed the ogre's body which became monstrous and with features similar to his master's. <br />
<br />
Easy to see Cho'gall will be a main character, or one of the main characters, leading to the events of the cataclysm.<br />
resurrecting (part of)C'thun somehow to allow the other old gods to break free. it could go well with blizzard agenda of resurrecting old content, something in the form of 20/40 man AQ with C'thun/Cho'gall last bosses in the last patch before the new expansion.<br />
please don't flame me if it was posted before, I'm just speculating here :P</div></div><hr />
