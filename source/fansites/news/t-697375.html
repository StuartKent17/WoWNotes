Patch 3.3.3 introduced a lot of data for the prologue, or at least a part of it. If you checked the site when the patch was first release you already know that players will be able to recapture Gnomeregan (Alliance) and the Echo Isles (Horde). <br />
<br />
Achievements and Overcloaks<br />
This is where it all started, the new achievements were discovered instantly on the Item Database Latest Additions (http://db.mmo-champion.com/latest).<br />
<br />
Gnomecoming King (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4786/) - You assisted High Tinker Mekkatorque and the Gnomeregan Exiles in the recapture of Gnomeregan's surface.<br />
Gnomecoming Queen (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4787/) - You assisted High Tinker Mekkatorque and the Gnomeregan Exiles in the recapture of Gnomeregan's surface.<br />
<br />
There isn't any Horde achievement for the moment and they will probably be added to the game in a later PTR build.<br />
<br />
After digging a little more in the game files it also looks like players will be rewarded with &quot;cosmetic cloaks&quot; at some point. Apparently, Blizzard introduced an Overcloak mechanism that allows you to change the appearance of your cloak without having to unequip your regular super-epic cloak.<br />
<br />
Gnomeregan Overcloak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74842/gnomeregan-overcloak/) - Right Click to don a cosmetic cloak. Will cover the appearance but not the effect of any existing cloak.<br />
Orgrimmar Overcloak (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74847/orgrimmar-overcloak/) - Right Click to don a cosmetic cloak. Will cover the appearance but not the effect of any existing cloak.<br />
<br />
More spells should be introduced later according to the models I found in the game files. (Personal message to Blizzard: Guild Tabards overcloaks, please!)<br />

<br />
<br />
Flight Paths<br />
More flight paths have been added to the game. First, you have to understand that everytime you use a vehicle following an automated path, most of the coordinates it uses are stored in your client and aren't received from the server. Knowing that, we can reproduce the paths on a world map (yes, we can do that) and check where the various Cataclysm missions will bring us. <br />

Quest Lines<br />
A lot of quests have been added to the game for this event. Keep in mind that this is only a small part of the entire event but it will give you a good idea of how players will recapture Gnomeregan and the Echo Isles.<br />
<br />
There is also a third questline involving the Twilight's Cult, the end of the world is near and they really want you to know about it! <br />
<br />
<br />
Alliance - Recapturing Gnomeregan<br />
<br />
Quest - A Few Good Gnomes (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25229/a-few-good-gnomes/)R<br />
Objective - Recruit Gnome Citizens from Tinker Town using the Motivate-a-Tron and lead them to Captain Tread Sparknozzle at Steelgrill's Depot.<br />
Description<br />
Our engineers have been working on getting our battle machines ready for our assault on Gnomeregan, but we're out of pilots! We've developed a device called the Motivate-a-Tron, which prevents distraction from other sources and gives the gnome the courage to enlist. After motivating a few Gnome Citizens, lead them out to Captain Tread Sparknozzle out at Steelgrill's Depot, just south of Ironforge. Oh, and be careful. The device is still a little experimental. <br />
<br />
Quest - Basic Orders (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25199/basic-orders/)<br />
Objective - Follow Drill Sergeant Steamcrank's cues and then report back to Captain Tread Sparknozzle.<br />
Description<br />
Hey! You look like you could give us a hand! If you're willing to help our cause, we have to get you through training. Gnome training is brutal and rigorous, so I hope you're ready. Head over to Drill Sergeant Steamcrank and he'll walk you through what you need to know. Make sure you follow his orders when he gives them, or else you'll never make it I'm warning you though, it's tough over there. Come back to see me, if you make it. <br />
<br />
Quest - Vent Horizon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25212/vent-horizon/)<br />
Objective - Use Pilot Muzzlesprock's flying machine to toss Radiageigatrons at the vents surrounding Gnomeregan.<br />
Description<br />
We thought that we could wait for the radiation to subside around Gnomeregan, but it doesn't appear to be getting better. If we want to take back our city, we need to make sure it's safe for our troops to enter. Take these Radiageigatrons, hop in 'Thunderflash' here, and toss them at the ventilation shafts outside of Gnomeregan. They'll report the radiation levels directly to me. <br />
<br />
Quest - Prepping the Speech (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25283/prepping-the-speech/)<br />
Objective - Use the Gnomish Playback Device in front of Ozzie Togglevolt west of Kharanos, Milli Featherwhistle at Steelgrill Depot and Tog Rustsprocket outside the Kharanos Inn. Return to Toby Zieggear when all the speeches have been given.<br />
Description<br />
High Tinker Mekkatorque asked me to write a speech that he could give before the battle starts, but I can't tell which draft is good and which ones just stink. Could you try some of them out on some of the local gnome residents? This device creates an image of Mekkatorque saying a few lines from each of my speech drafts. Let me know which one works, okay? <br />
<br />
Quest - Words for Delivery (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25286/words-for-delivery/)<br />
Objective - Give the speech to Captain Tread Sparknozzle at Steelgrill Depot.<br />
Description<br />
Here we go. This is the speech, &lt;name&gt;! It has everything to be a great battle starter: It's inspirational, has eloquent language and speaks directly to gnomes. Never has a finer speech been written! Turn this in to Captain Tread Sparknozzle and get some transportation to High Tinker Mekkatorque! <br />
<br />
Quest - Words for Delivery (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25287/words-for-delivery/)<br />
Objective - Ride 'Thunderflash' from Steelgrill Depot to High Tinker Mekkatorque and deliver Toby's speech.<br />
Description<br />
All right, soldier. Time to prove your worth! Take the speech and board the flying machine &quot;Thunderflash&quot;. It's the fastest ship to High Tinker Mekkatorque and this speech is the only thing he's waiting on before starting Operation: Gnomeregan. Go! Now! <br />
<br />
Quest - Operation: Gnomeregan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25393/operation-gnomeregan/)<br />
Objective - [PH]Help King Mekkatorque take back Gnomeregan.<br />

Description<br />
[PH] Help Mekkatorque take back Gnomeregan.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alliance - Mechano-Tanks Tutorial?<br />
<br />
Quest - In and Out (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25285/in-and-out/)<br />
Objective - Test out the ejection system in the Ejector Mechano-Tank.<br />
Description<br />
We've gotta get these new mechano-tanks ready for the assault. You ready to help test these bad boys out?! Of course you are! First, we need to make sure that once you're in, you can get out. In battle, if you think your tank is going to explode, get out! I've seen many a gnome stay in 'til the bitter end... the tank blows up, and them along with it. Well, I've upgraded this tank with an ejection seat. Try it out for me, will ya? <br />
<br />
Quest - One Step Forward... (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25289/one-step-forward/)<br />
Objective - Test the the Scuttling Mechano-Tank's maneuverability.<br />

With the ejection system working, I think we're ready to test out movement. This tank has an extra special feature: Automatic Evasive Maneuvers! I want you to check out the servos on the left leg, the right leg and the Automatic Evasive Maneuver system. This is easy stuff, so it shouldn't take too long. <br />
<br />
Quest - Press Fire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25295/press-fire/)<br />
Objective - Test out the Shooting Mechano-Tank weapon systems on the nearby targets.<br />
Description<br />
Safety systems, online! Motor functions, functioning! Now all we need is to make sure that the guns will fire. This shouldn't be too hard, &lt;name&gt;. The mechano-tank on the hill behind us has been loaded with harmless pellets. Just fire off a couple rounds at the nearby targets and report back to me. <br />
<br />
<br />

Quest - Da Perfect Spies (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25444/da-perfect-spies/)<br />

Description<br />

Description<br />
Vol'jin has given me his war drums and put me in charge of trainin' da new recruits here. Only problem is we be short on new recruits. Supposin' I loaned ya dis drum, would ya use it to sound de call to war on Vol'jin's behalf in Razor Hill? If ya could even inspire just a few trolls to join da cause, it would make a difference.

<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/doomsdaymessage_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/doomsdaymessage.jpg)<br />
<br />
Quest - Prophecies of Doom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25228/prophecies-of-doom/) / Prophecies of Doom (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25228/prophecies-of-doom/)<br />
Objective - Listen to a speech given by a Doomsayer in the Drag and obtain copies of the pamphlets &quot;Elemental Fire for the Soul&quot;, &quot;What Does 'The End of All Things' Mean for Me?&quot;, and &quot;Finding Security and Comfort in a Doomed World&quot;.<br />
Description<br />
Harbingers of doom are nothing new on the streets of Orgrimmar, but I'm worried about this latest batch. These people are organized and they've attracted a lot of attention in the Drag, where they seem to congregate. I've thought about rounding them up or otherwise disrupting their activities, but that will just drive them underground. We need to find out more about them. Would you go to the Drag, listen to what these doomsayers are spreading, and gather any literature you can find about their ideas? <br />
<br />
Quest - Signs of the Times (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25254/signs-of-the-times/) / Signs of the Times (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25282/signs-of-the-times/)<br />
Objective - Setup 5 Warning Posters around the Valley of Strength, the Drag, or the Valley of Honor.<br />
Description<br />
We've got to do something to reduce interest in this doomsday cult, but I'm hesitant to take much action until we know more about who is behind this group. I've had my men place markers around heavily traveled areas in Orgrimmar. Take these posters and set them up where you see the markers. They won't discourage the most determined of seekers, but it's a first step in exposing this cult. The Horde has enough to deal with as it is, without people wilfully spreading lies too. <br />
<br />
Quest - Infiltrating the Cult (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25288/infiltrating-the-cult/) / Infiltrating the Cult (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25290/infiltrating-the-cult/)<br />
Objective - Speak to a Doomsayer Orgrimmar's Drag to join the cult, then put on your Recruit's Robe.<br />
Description<br />
The streets of Orgrimmar are wild with rumors about the cult's origins and practices. There's only one way to know the truth about this group, &lt;name&gt;. You're going to join them. Approach one of the Doomsayers in the Drag and tell them you wish to join their group. With any luck, they will give you instructions to introduce yourself to one of the group's leaders and tell you where the group is hiding. Don any clothing given to you by the doomsayer; you'll need it to gain entry to the group's hideout. <br />
<br />
Quest - Spreading the Word (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25380/spreading-the-word/) / Spreading the Word (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25415/spreading-the-word/)<br />
Objective - While wearing your Doomsday Message, visit the East Zeppelin Tower, the West Zeppelin Tower, and the town square of Razor Hill.<br />
Description<br />
Welcome to the farm, &lt;name&gt;. Everyone here works to earn &lt;his/her&gt; keep. For some, that means caring for the animals. Others are responsible for working on our construction projects. Still others work to spread our message among the people and I think that's a good place for you to start. Take this board. It bears a short message about our beliefs. While wearing the board, visit the eastern and western zeppelin towers outside Orgrimmar's gates, as well as the town square of Razor Hill, to the south. <br />
<br />
Quest - The Master's Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25416/the-masters-plan/) / The Master's Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25343/the-masters-plan/)<br />
Objective - Learn more about the cult's plans at the altar in the eastern part of the Jaggedswine Farm.<br />
Description<br />
You're fitting in well here, &lt;name&gt;, but there is more to us than daily chores and spreading the message. I'm sure you heard a little bit about it when you first joined. As you know, this world is ending and the unprepared will die painful deaths. We have been given a gift, an opportunity to become something greater and more powerful. Overseer Golbaz is will be preparing a ritual before the altar at the eastern end of the farm. Wait there for him, and learn more of your new brothers and sisters. <br />
<br />
Quest - The Doomsday Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25417/the-doomsday-plan/) / The Doomsday Plan (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25347/the-doomsday-plan/)<br />
Objective - Take the Elemental Devices to Blood Guard Torek in Orgrimmar's Valley of Strength.<br />
Description<br />
The first batch of elemental devices are ready. Your task will be to conceal them inside the city of Orgrimmar. The devices will unleash their fire elementals at the proper time. Don't worry, &lt;name&gt;, you'll be safely away before that happens. Do not do anything that would draw attention to yourself. &lt;The overseer hands you a package containing several of the elemental devices. This is just the kind of proof that Blood Guard Torek was hoping you'd uncover. You should probably bring the devices to him.&gt; <br />
<br />
Quest - Thwarting Twilight's Hammer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25418/thwarting-twilights-hammer/) / Thwarting Twilight's Hammer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25348/thwarting-twilights-hammer/)<br />
Objective - Break Elemental Devices to release their elementals. You must defeat 5 Raging Fire Elementals.<br />
Description<br />
You can't have been the only person sent into Orgrimmar to deploy those devices containing fire elementals. We have to find and disable the rest of the devices before set their captive elementals free and burn down the city. Are you familiar enough with the devices to destroy them? You need to break them open before the fire elementals inside have had time to reach full strength. They should be easy to defeat if you open the devices early. The cultists have probably put them all over the city. <br />
<br />
Quest - Warn King Wrynn (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25425/warn-king-wrynn/) / Warn the Warchief (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/25351/alert-the-warchief/)<br />
Objective - Speak with Thrall at Grommash Hold in Orgrimmar's Valley of Wisdom.<br />
Description<br />
You have successfully defended Orgrimmar from the threat posed by this Twilight's Hammer cult, &lt;name&gt;, and without shedding the blood of our own people. Our enemy will not rest for long. I cannot imagine that Cho'Gall will accept defeat so easily. You must take word to Thrall. Go to the Valley of Wisdom and speak to him in Grommash Hold. Tell the warchief that our enemies have shown themselves and we must be prepared for their return. <br />
<br />
<br />
Models<br />
A couple of models related to the Twilight's Cult questline have also been added to the files. <br />

High Tinker Gelbin Mekkatorque: The Liberation of Gnomeregan<br />
Gelbin Mekkatorque is known as much for his technical brilliance as he is for his just leadership of the gnomes. In addition to being elected high tinker, the most prominent rank in gnomish society, Gelbin proved himself to be an inventor without equal by leading the construction of the Deeprun Tram, which links Stormwind and Ironforge. Yet all of the high tinker's achievements have been overshadowed by one catastrophic event that occurred under his rule: the fall of Gnomeregan.<br />
<br />
Around the time of the Third War, an ancient menace known as the troggs surfaced in Gnomeregan from the depths of Azeroth. This barbaric race, thought to have been unintentionally released during the Uldaman excavation, crushed the gnomes' defenses and became entrenched in the lower sections of the city. Gelbin, for all his genius, was at a loss for a way to eradicate the savage invaders until his chief advisor, Mekgineer Sicco Thermaplugg, proposed that they inundate Gnomeregan with toxic radiation.<br />
<br />
Confident in Thermaplugg's radical plan, Mekkatorque gave the order to irradiate the city. This bold move worked at first: toxic radiation spread throughout Gnomeregan and momentarily stopped the troggs' incursion. Soon, however, it was evident that the radiation was killing gnomes as well as troggs. In the end, nearly eighty percent of the gnomish race died, and many of those who survived were mutated into deranged leper gnomes. To add to the tragedy, the troggs then resumed their assault on the city.<br />
<br />
Mekkatorque and the healthy survivors evacuated Gnomeregan and were taken in by the dwarves of neighboring Ironforge, but Thermaplugg disappeared. The high tinker later learned troubling news that his former advisor had seized control of the toxic gnomish city and instated himself as its twisted overlord. Much to Mekkatorque's shock, he also discovered that Thermaplugg had secretly desired the office of high tinker and might have been previously aware of or even complicit in the trogg invasion.<br />
<br />
The immense loss of life at Gnomeregan weighed heavy on Mekkatorque's shoulders, and in his fury he ordered the death of Thermaplugg. A band of heroes took up the mission and returned with a tale of victory, but after analyzing the claim, Mekkatorque realized that the mechanized overlord defeated in the depths of the city was likely nothing more than a cleverly engineered facsimile of Thermaplugg.<br />
<br />
Aware that defeating his nemesis would require a more robust approach, Mekkatorque labored over strategies to retake his city. His tireless brainstorming recently paid off with Operation: Gnomeregan, a brilliant multi-phased assault plan to liberate the gnomish capital and bring the real Thermaplugg to justice. With the operation set to begin, resourceful gnomes such as &quot;Doc&quot; Cogspin, Captain Tread Sparknozzle, and Drill Sergeant Steamcrank have been overseeing preparations and fine-tuning new technology that will be vital to the offensive.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Mekkatorque has begun rounding up all able-bodied gnomes to join in the attack, and his call to arms has also been heard by other members of the Alliance. The gnomes' techno-savvy has been vital in past conflicts, and many Alliance heroes are likely to join the offensive to recapture the extraordinary inventions within the fallen city. For Mekkatorque, however, his plan goes beyond just reacquiring lost technology. The retaking of Gnomeregan will determine his legacy in history, either as the high tinker who lost the gnomes' beloved capital, or the one who reestablished it as the center of innovation on Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Operation: Gnomeregan is now. <br />

Vol'jin: The Glory of the Darkspears<br />
Most of Azeroth's savage trolls are infamous for their extreme hatred of other races, but the Darkspear tribe and its leader, Vol'jin, are an exception. Over the years, the Darkspears have proven to be invaluable members of the Horde. Vol'jin in particular is known to offer strategic advice to Warchief Thrall on a regular basis, and the cunning troll played a role in retaking the Undercity after it was overthrown by the rebel forces of Varimathras and Putress.<br />
<br />
Yet for all of the tribe's accomplishments, the Darkspears are still plagued by a tragic history of exile. Long ago they were driven from Stranglethorn Vale's mainland by the more powerful trolls of the Gurubashi empire and then settled on a remote island. The Darkspears later sought refuge with the Horde when their isle was destroyed by a mysterious sea witch, and Thrall granted the trolls new lands on the Echo Isles off the coast of Durotar. Aside from a brief exodus when Daelin Proudmoore's fleet arrived to hunt down orcs, the Darkspears enjoyed relative stability until one of their own, Zalazane, drove his brethren from their latest home.<br />
<br />
The witch doctor Zalazane had been one of the tribe's leading mystical instructors when he was inexplicably driven to insanity by the powers under his control. Utilizing dark magic, he enslaved many of his fellow tribespeople and amassed an army of mindless Darkspear trolls. Fearing that all of his tribe would come under Zalazane's sway, Vol'jin ordered the remaining free Darkspears to abandon the Echo Isles.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin's Darkspears settled in nearby Sen'jin Village, which they have since used as a staging point to attack Zalazane. Over the years, members of the Horde looking to test their worth have braved the Echo Isles to confront Zalazane, and many of them even returned victorious with his severed head. These victories, however, proved to be nothing more than an illusion created by the twisted witch doctor's dark magic. Days after these trophies were taken to Sen'jin Village, they reverted to their true forms: painted rocks and coconuts adorned with wooden tusks, or even the heads of Zalazane's enslaved trolls.<br />
<br />
Despite these setbacks and his preoccupation with advising Thrall on Horde-related matters, Vol'jin has spent considerable time formulating a strategy to recapture the Echo Isles. Now he believes that the time to strike at Zalazane has come. As the Darkspear leader and his close allies Vanira and Champion Uru'zin await approval of their plan from the ancestral spirits, they have begun rounding up new troll recruits and staging reconnaissance missions to learn about Zalazane's minions.<br />
<br />
Yet Vol'jin's trolls are short on forces, and the enslaved Darkspears on the Echo Isles outnumber them. The Darkspears are well-known for being among Azeroth's bravest combatants, however, and fortunately many non-trolls have expressed interest in assisting Vol'jin, perhaps hoping that restoring the Echo Isles will eventually bolster the Horde's strength.<br />
<br />
Vol'jin is also aware of the strategic importance that a Darkspear homeland offers his allies, but he is motivated by more personal reasons. Zalazane's betrayal was an affront against Vol'jin's dream of a better life for his tribe, a destiny that his late father, Sen'jin, envisioned years ago. Only by retaking the Echo Isles will Vol'jin be able to honor his father and at long last secure a permanent homeland for the long-exiled Darkspear tribe. <br />

I don't know, while customization is fun. There could be a point when it gets out of hand. Like if they started going down the road of micro-transactions so you can have a different cloak looks or even eventually modify your armor, that's a bad sign.<br />
<br />
Not saying it's what they're doing, but its just a step in the direction.</div></div><hr />

I hope they can make a good story from the Lich King fight towards Deathwing's return, they really shouldn't go easy on that, plenty of room for some good old fashioned storybuilding.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the way I saw it, the quests only focus on the starting areas (Dun Morogh / Durotar). Is there any way of telling yet whether you can also do these quests as a lower level character? Of course I doubt Zalazane will still be level 11, but it would be 'logical' if even the smallest persons could help in for example the espionage quests etc.</div></div><hr />

Servers are larger, there is more population. However the population count hasnt raised since the WotLK launch, there shouldn't be THAT MUCH lag.<br />

He tried to resurrect C'thun, but it went terribly wrong and now C'thun has combined with Cho'gall.<br />
<br />
Cho'gall is essentially a host body now for C'thun.</div></div><hr />

I agree! Sort of the same way as they did in LotRO. Every toon has two &quot;outfits&quot; where they can place gear (except weapons) and yet retain the stats from their primary gear. In short: You have have part T9 and part T10 equipped i your main gear slots and for instance your entire T6 set in an outfit slot. Then you'll run around looking old school :)<br />

Anyone remember Zombie invasion? Could have been epic but not with WoW Community that gets pissed when not being able to do the &quot;daily life in WoW&quot; like standing on the mailbox. Easy way to make those guys not cry? Add achievements for that and they will be the first to do it.<br />
Zombie invasion would have been not stopped by blizzard if there were achievements because the people crying over it are the same that do EVERYTHING for some points.</div></div><hr />

I am a huge fan of customization. The only thing that bothers me in WoW is that everyone looks the same.<br />
<br />
On the other hand loading 1000 textures for the same model (while loging in Dalaran) will be a pain in the @$$, so it would be nice to have this feature enabled / disabled through options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
At any given time, you can be certain that Cataclysm (as in the actual expansion hitting the stores) is at least 6 months away if the beta hasn't started yet.<br />
<br />
They will not have the beta running for less than 6 months. <br />
<br />
So currently, the earliest you can expect the Xpac to hit is early fall. My guess is that it will hit in November just like Wrath did (and that BC was planned to hit, although they screwed it up and got it delayed).</div></div><hr />

Overcloaks... the sortof technical thing that Blizz is doing there makes me hope against hope that someday we'll be able to display the graphics of armor we have, and want to display, while retaining the stats and bonuses of our current armor sets.<br />

<br />
Actually, this overcloak sounds more like another type of tabard. Nothing hints at &quot;overgloves&quot; or &quot;overshoulders&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This whole entire feature would have to come with a function that automatically cancels the mirage of the other gear when queuing into PvP scenarios (and to a lesser extent, random dungeons (can you imagine how fast you'd get kicked after zoning into a random dungeon if the other people looked at you and saw pre-WotLK gear?)). It would be rather frustrating to zone into a BG/Arena to see the other players/team &quot;wearing&quot; S5 gear and they then proceed to wipe the floor with you.</div></div><hr />

There is speculation that these areas become the Trolls'/Gnomes' new starting (1-5) areas, so that they don't have to share one with the Dwarves/Orcs. Meaning the wildlife might stay, or even be lowered some levels, not that it mattered.</div></div><hr />

Lord of the Rings Online has had that for a long time. Any item you possess can have its appearance &quot;cloned&quot; and then applied to other items without affecting their stats.

<br />
<br />
Maybe this is a difficult concept to understand, so I will attempt to spell it our in more detail for you:<br />
<br />
This site, and its wizard genius Boubouille along with his friends, loves to dig &quot;behind the scenes&quot; of current Blizzard information to bring fans the latest and most in depth news possible. In order to do this they go BEHIND the patch you see and play and dig into the data files to uncover what new stuff is there or being implied. This, along with Boubouille's friends and connections in the Warcraft universe allow him to give you these sneak previews that are NOT YET AVAILABLE to you to play on the PTR or the retail game.<br />
<br />
It's a double - edged sword because sometimes these files behind the scenes are NOT COMPLETE or they are missing artwork and people say &quot;Boubouille!!! Please give us the new artwork!! Why won't you show it to us??!!&quot; and he must have to facepalm his head because the information is not yet available otherwise he would have already shown it to us.<br />
<br />
So to answer your question NOTHING in this update is playable by you on the PTR. This is behind the scenes stuff that Boubouille is digging out for you to enjoy.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm is still over 6 months away. WOO!<br />
<br />
<br />
(Boubouille won me over with the Worgen/Goblin info. I SOOOOOOO hoped he was barking up the wrong tree and was completely getting bad info... when it all pretty much came out EXACTLY as he previewed.. well.. all hail Boubouille!!)</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the ensuing world-wide devastation and nations looking inwards as they rebuild their cities and tend to the injured and dead, Hogger will gather the gnolls of Elwynn Forest and stage a massive coup on the denizens in Goldshire, claiming it for their own in a bloody battle filled with the screams of the fallen and incessant giggling battle cries. The streets will run thick with the blood of their enemies before they stand- err, hunch over victorious in the main square. They will then use it as a base of operations in order to gather strength, supplies, and numbers, as they plot their final assault upon Stormwind and destroy their human oppressors once and for all!<br />

Still, he did so by merging a probably actual leak with a SA fan speculation (or reposting what was offered to him as a real leak) and thus we still have so many people believing that Cairne will be murdered, Azshara will appear in Cataclysm, and that the Blackrock will explode.<br />
Heck, those people, when they finally realize this stuff won't be in Cataclysm, will whine to Blizzard why they didn't put this in even though they &quot;promised&quot; it...</div></div><hr />

My suggestion would be to make it purchasable option at Class Trainers - make it 2500 gold (entirely viable in few weeks work) and require level 60. That way Newbies wouldn't have to deal with the extra option, but anyone (even one who's only reached Level Cap pre-BC) will be able to use it.<br />

Really? You think that: because there is information in the PTR build, information that is not even being actively tested, information that is hidden and had to be ferreted out by people who understand WoW's data structures, information related not to the Cataclysm itself but to the Pre-Cataclysm event... You think this means that Cataclysm will be out in less than 6 months? Really? There are *at least* two more patches in the works before Cataclysm. We *know* that 3.3.3 and 3.3.5 are in the works (I note a suspicious absence of a 3.3.4 too, but maybe they're holding that as a place holder in case 3.3.3 stuff needs fixing after release). <br />
<br />
So, it's nearly March. Let's pretend for a moment that they test 3.3.3 and 3.3.5 for a very short 1 month period each before releasing them (and that their is no 3.3.4). That puts in very late April or early May before 3.3.5 is released. Leaving three months to PTR patch 4.0 and release Cataclysm? I seriously doubt it. As this point I would be fairly surprised at anything earlier than a late autumn release. Early autumn is possible but unlikely. Early winter seems like where the best money would go.</div></div><hr />

They wont do it, unless they plan Starcraft for summer release instead. They WILL NOT release 2 games at the same time or even within 2 months of each other it is very bad for sales, especially at Christmas when everyone would want both and most wouldnt be able to afford both.<br />
<br />
So summer will be Starcraft2 or Cataclysm, and same for Christmas (could be either). I guess it just depends on what they want to go with. Unlike Starcraft2 they don't need to do as much balancing in WoW becasue as we all know that's what the patches are for. SC2 on the other hand requires a lot more input an polishing over all for every aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
On a side note, Cataclysm has been in production just as long, if not longer than Lich King.</div></div><hr />

Talking about the Echo Isles, I have seen something in Razor Hill on PTR 3.3.3 which is missing in Razor Hill on the live realms. I am talking about the Troll Citizens:<br />

<br />
It'll be interesting to see if Troll and Worgen Druids start appearing in Moonglade prior to Cataclysm.<br />
<br />

Blizzard tests live on patch servers. Of course they've done internal QA and testing on the patches before they release to PTR, but only a month on the PTR would be an extremely short public test period by Blizzard standards. 3.3 was on PTR for several months. 3.3.3 may only be on patch for a few weeks, since it has minimal new content, but it'll probably be there a month or so. 3.3.5 has an entire new raid, however small. It will be on PTR at least a month. From what anybody can tell, this new stuff isn't even part of 3.3.5... Boub mined the info by looking at all the new data files, but none of this is active anywhere. Blizzard isn't going to change policy just because you want Cataclysm sooner. They will continue to chunk all new content up to the PTR and let people bang on it for a few weeks before they make it live. You saw this same kind of speculation leading up to LK release , &quot;OMG there's a new ghoul model in the patch files! WOTLK must be coming out next week!&quot;</div></div><hr />

Aside from the ghoul thing you mentioned, doesn't mean its going to be out in November. one raid and petty quests isn't going to last till Christmas. Summer release means, Parents, Kids, and everything in between will have time to play it for 3 months, instead of the 2 weeks of Christmas. They wait till Xmas and their cash cow will start to get skinny haha.</div></div><hr />

Heck, those people, when they finally realize this stuff won't be in Cataclysm, will whine to Blizzard why they didn't put this in even though they &quot;promised&quot; it...<br />
<br />
<br />
SPOILER<br />
Heh, if you're going to pick on Boubouille, at least do it for valid reasons. While the two latter are quite obviously bogus, Cairne will indeed be murdered, hints in blue posts in response to the initial uproar at the leaks pretty much confirmed this. Like that wasn't enough, new versions of the tauren quests involving Cairne were slipped into the game files a few patches ago, instead directing to his son, Bairne. So yeah, there you go. ::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please link those. I only vaguely remember something about him &quot;feeling adventurous&quot; and wanting to spend the rest of his life out in the wild. However, &quot;hints&quot; are usually meant to be ambigous, so I'm guessing they just hinted that Cairne would step back, nothing more.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Actually, if you go back to the news article, you find that Boub linked to a thread I started about these new quests. However, this just indicates that Baine will succeed Cairne, but it doesn't mean at all that Cairne has to die.</div></div><hr />

Maybe. Maybe Blizzard will change so one train each from Ironforge and Stormwind go to Gnomeregan and Gnomergan has a train to go to Ironforge and a train to go to Stormwind.<br />
<br />
For all we know, Gnomeregan may have a portal system set up like in Shattrath City and Daralan.<br />
<br />
Given some of these are bombing run quests, I hope Blizzard decides to open up the landing strip above Ironforge to make use for those quests.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The immense loss of life at Gnomeregan weighed heavy on Mekkatorque's shoulders, and in his fury he ordered the death of Thermaplugg.

These victories, however, proved to be nothing more than an illusion created by the twisted witch doctor's dark magic.

Yes, it is pretty stupid. I think Blizzard is realizing now that they ruined the gnome and troll stories early in the game by allowing low-level players to kill Zalazane/Thermaplugg. This is a quick-fix, hasty solution that is pretty incomprehensible and extremely convoluted, but meh, it works. We should just focus on how awesome it will be for Gnome/Trolls to finally get a capital city of their own. :D</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has said they do not have a release date for Cataclysm. They also said, mentioning Gamestop by name, that any store offering pre-orders for Cataclysm with a date attached is just a date that the store is giving as an estimate, not in any way backed up by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Most logical answer indeed. They didn't plan it as 3.4 in case they had to do an actual 3.4 to cover some additional time until the release of Cata, so they just gave this upcoming patch the highest numberin this product cycle.</div></div><hr />

Gnomes are the TRUE rulers of Azeroth...Horde and Alliance both are ran by gnomes, everyone just underestimates them and fails to realize it!!</div></div><hr />

My question is rather, how the HELL is General Drakkisath still alive, or Rend, or Nefarian? <br />
<br />
<br />
Its kind of hard to make a video game if you have to kill every mob, permenantly. Just think about all quest mobs, you dont go around saying &quot;Heeeeey... I killed this guy before.. This is wrong!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not becoming a capital city, but a level 1-5 starting area for Trolls. Same with Gnomeregan surface for Gnomes.<br />
<br />
<br />
any word which patch this will be fully active?<br />
<br />
No. If there was anything official or even comprehensibly hinting at a date, it'd be on this article.<br />
Since they already numbered this patch 3.9, this could mean it will be the last patch of WotLK no matter what, and e.g. will be released 4-6 weeks before 4.0, whenever that comes.</div></div><hr />

This stuff was discovered on the 3.3.3 PTR, but that doesn't mean it would be officially released with that patch.</div></div><hr />
