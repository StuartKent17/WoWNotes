<br />
Important - To clarify a few things, I decided to use the internal item database of MMO-Champion (http://db.mmo-champion.com) (yeah we actually have our own). Please keep in mind that even if most of the information is here it is not a real database and isn't meant to replace Wowhead or anything like that, it just helps having updated data during PTR testing. Also, it wasn't really supposed to go public and it's probably full of nasty bugs, we'll work on them. Please post feedback in this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=67292.0)<br />
<br />
Patch 3.2 now on PTRs<br />
Patch 3.2 is now available for download and I will update the site A LOT in the next few hours, stay tuned!<br />

Patch Notes Update<br />
The official patch notes (http://) have been slightly updated.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (3.1 Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=650) / 3.1 Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Blood Plague: Damage done increased by 15%.<br />
Blood Strike: The bonus damage this ability receives from diseases on the target has been increased to 25% per disease.<br />
Chains of Ice: Now reduces movement by 95% instead of 100%. The main effect of this change will be that targets of Chains of Ice will not have to re-issue a movement command to continue moving.<br />

<br />
World Environment<br />
Northrend Children's Week has arrived in Dalaran! Players can find out more by visiting the Eventide District.<br />
Portal areas in all major cities now offer a portal to the Blasted Lands near the Dark Portal.<br />
Once crossing through the Dark Portal, players can access a flight path directly from the Stair of Destiny to Shattrath.<br />
A new zeppelin docking ramp has been added to Thunder Bluff allowing Horde players easier transport to and from Orgrimmar.<br />
The local Postal Service has grown tired of walking so far each day to collect mail and has decided to install a large number of new mailboxes to Stormwind, Undercity, Darnassus and Orgrimmar.<br />
Matias in Darnassus has finally earned himself enough money from your repair bills that he was able to buy himself an anvil.<br />
<br />
New Models<br />

Less hindered, as in normally something slows the shaman for 50%, when the shaman is in ghost wolf it only slows him for 25%. Don't know the exact numbers yet ofc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
1. I dont see the fear change as a nerf, fearing + piercing howl + aoe was pretty good, now I won't have to use piercing howl.<br />
<br />
2. AttT is a buff even if you wear leather, youll get more ap, just less than if you wear plate so to those who wear plate already, its a pretty decent buff, about ~1.5%dmg with mostly ilvl226 plate gear.<br />
<br />
3. The bloodfrenzy change doesnt remove the 4% debuff, it only change the increase attack speed to only effect melee attack instead of everything (ranged).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Fear is a nerf, AttT is a buff no matter how you slice it (it's still more AP even if you wear all leather) and Blood Frenzy doesn't matter. It's changing the wording on the self-buff effect to make it only melee haste instead of global (also spell) haste. It has zero, repeat zero, effect on Arms.</div></div><hr />

And be happy that this path is not about your class, so you are not nerfed. As, if you are not rogue, any change to your class most likely means nerf. <br />

Rogues, meanwhile, are slightly buffed again. Leveling my lvl60 further on, I give up trying to play any class but rogue in this game, even while I hate then. I mean, hate playing them and hate playing against them.</div></div><hr />

In fact they have a lot of creativity, but it targeting different way. This development team loves to play with so called balance and change classes.* All other things are not interesting for them. So, events like children week and midsummer are not changed from TBC.* Colosseum seem to be pretty crap raid instance. BUT, we have another bastard of those arrogant morons creativity - revamped, &quot;buffed&quot; paladins.</div></div><hr />

The block value on all items will be pretty much doubled, making Paladins and Warrior way better than they are now. The thing Death Knights had to make up for the lack of block, was armor. Most Death Knight tanks lost about 3000 armor to the Frost Presence nerf and now we lose 5% more due to the Toughness nerf. And as if that isn't enough, we'll lose a sh*tload of health aswell due to the second Frost Presence nerf. Not to mention the awesome quality of Frost Strike that it cannot be dodged, parrier or blocked being removed.<br />
<br />
I didn't know Death Knight tanks were so overpowered they needed all these nerfs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I suspect molten armor is a mistake in datamining, weirdness with different ranks, it happens.<br />
<br />
Enduring Winter isn't a nerf, except to the extent that *all* replenishment is going from 0.25% per second to 1% per 5 seconds. The once per 6 seconds is a FIX, and a buff, because a frost mage with 3/3 and enough haste to cast 1.9 second frostbolts was refreshing the buff every 1.9 seconds, meaning a tick every 1.9 seconds instead of 1 second. It lasts well over 6 seconds so it is overall just a fix to refreshes costing ticks.</div></div><hr />

Have you read the entire 2 piece bonus? Mage armor grants more regeneration (I really don't understand why) and Molten Armor converts an additional 25% of your spirit into crit rating (80% !!!!!).<br />

The article posted on the main page saying the ptr is up is False! It is not up or available for download. The EU ptr forums still show the EU ptr as being 'not live', there are no US ptr forums up at all yet.<br />

<br />
either that, or the new bg (Isle of conquest) portals<br />
<br />
however that DOES look extremely like the starting bases in borean tundra<br />
<br />
edit: looking at them a little closer, the horde one doesn't seem to be the borean tundra base, so most likely the new bg portals</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I know, crit chance does suck alot for arcane as well as it does for frost oriented mages. I still believe 4p bonus is just a placeholder and might be changed to somewhat more arcane-friendly. Anyway I was juste talking about the 2p bonus :P. I heard some arcane mages can afford Molten since they're doing good with ulduar gear regen stats and mana gem glyph (assuming 2p T7) and meditation.<br />
<br />
10% more in-cast regen is pointless since it's capped at 100% (which you can already do with mage armor glyph) :-\.</div></div><hr />

(t7 2p-&gt; 10% shield slam dmg nice!, t8 2p-&gt; 10% devastate crit LOL? ok but at least i use it alot, t9 5secs off intervene wtf? who the fuck spams intervene!)<br />
<br />
on a side note, its kind of dumb for them to have kept the 20% magic dmg reduction on the 4pc set bonus for t8, you're essentially voiding this extra cooldown that warriors wanted/needed by inputting new gear. very smart blizzard undoing yourself again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
User Interface<br />
<br />
Quest creatures and objects will now show on the player?s world map.<br />
A skull graphic will be placed on the map in the general area where creatures players must kill can be found.<br />
A glowing skull graphic will be placed on the map in the general area where creatures can be found that drop quest objects.<br />
A gear graphic will be placed on the map in the general area where players must loot objects found in the world.<br />
A chat bubble graphic will be placed on the map in the general area where players must interact with a specific NPC.<br />
