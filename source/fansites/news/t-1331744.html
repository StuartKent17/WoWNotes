It's time to end the fun party we've been having for the past 24H. As it turns out, it's pretty easy to add whatever the hell you want on a .gov website. According to this new page, Blizzard just trademarked Corgis Unleashed (http://teas.uspto.gov/forms/xslt.service?xsl=input&amp;stamp=USPTO/FTK-64.71.21.238-20130814120043649151-eTEAS-5002254c2c79d6aec8bf777b67318fc458a605d98a3ad9671ba654fed544b2367f), a game that according to our sources would kind of look like this (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGwQqxDWE2M).<br />
<br />
Edit: Apparently the original news was too subtle, the &quot;Corgis Unleashed&quot; trademark was registered this morning for fun, as it turns out, there is absolutely no check and anyone can register something under Blizzard's name. This is an application, not a confirmation, you don't even need to pay the $275 application fee. <br />

We probably jumped on the bandwagon a little early and I spent the past 24H double checking stuff since it was basically everywhere, I guess today is just not the day. Sorry guys, going to call the whole The Dark Below thing a hoax.</div></div><hr />

Reaper of Souls is an actual teaser on the Diablo site, so it's legit.<br />

well, i bet reaper of souls will be revealed at gamescon, looks like they did the same as hearhtstone, reveal the trademark a few days before reveal. the dark below could be real, could be fake.</div></div><hr />

The Diablo trademark is real, as it was on the main site with a teaser image if I'm not mistaken. (Please correct me if I'm wrong.) The Dark Below however could be fake.</div></div><hr />

Reaper of souls is already on Blizzard site so we can only assume it is real. &quot;The Dark Below&quot;, however, may not be.</div></div><hr />

It's time to end the fun party we've been having for the past 24H. As it turns out, it's pretty easy to add whatever the hell you want on a .gov website. According to this new page, Blizzard just trademarked Corgis Unleashed (http://teas.uspto.gov/forms/xslt.service?xsl=input&amp;stamp=USPTO/FTK-64.71.21.238-20130814120043649151-eTEAS-5002254c2c79d6aec8bf777b67318fc458a605d98a3ad9671ba654fed544b2367f), a game that according to our sources would kind of look like this (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGwQqxDWE2M).<br />

Yes Cute but Deadly is real. The Dark Below never showed up in TESS (uspto.gov). So im gonna just call that MMO was the source of the hoax until Boub can show where he got the info from (which trademark website).<br />
<br />
Pretty sure its impossible to have access to preliminary filings and you only have the ones that get publisched in TESS. So hoax seems to originate from MMOC.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure its impossible to have access to preliminary filings and you only have the ones that get publisched in TESS. So hoax seems to originate from MMOC.<br />
<br />
Actually the trademark for the dark below has been linked back to the government website and it is real.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way it is linked back to uspto.gov (the trademark office website) is that someone filled out the online application form and saved it. The application was never submitted to the Trademark Office officially, as to do so, you have to sign the application under some severe penalties (perjury, etc.). That's why the application does NOT show up in the official trademark office database (TESS) when you search for it or for marks owned by Blizzard Entertainment.<br />
<br />
Also, after looking at the &quot;Dark Below&quot; image from yesterday, the top of it indicates &quot;TEAS Plus&quot; - which means that the description of goods and services has to be selected directly from the USPTO's manual (i.e., you can't use your own description) but the description of the &quot;Dark Below&quot; mark is not one that's found in the manual.<br />
<br />
TLDR: &quot;Dark Below&quot; is fake and is not a real trademark application filed by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What do you mean by &quot;approved&quot;? Once a trademark application is electronically submitted via the US Trademark Office website, it will appear in TESS (the online database) a couple of days later, regardless of whether the mark eventually registers. Many applications are filed where the mark in question gets rejected or abandoned without actually registering as a US trademark.<br />

That's just a form someone saved to their website, it is not actually submitted as a legitimate application. TESS (the database) is the only official source for submitted filings.

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that Blizzard is just filing crap now to throw us all off. I'm not saying that The Dark Below is 100% the next expansion, but I'm not completely writing it off based off of the filings today. <br />
<br />
And I don't particularly subscribe to the theory that all of this isn't some huge PR push to get people excited about WOW and possible have players resub in time for 5.4 and beyond, especially with FF14 hitting in a couple of weeks. Some leaks are made on purpose. Pretty interesting that Boub was the one to post the news in the first place. Hmmm...</div></div><hr />

The Dark Below application wasn't even made by Blizzard. It was just someone that wanted to play a joke. It hasn't been submitted as a real trademark. The $550 fee has NOT been paid. The Corgis Unleashed trademark isn't real either. That was just MMOs attempt to show everyone how easy it is to fill out a trademark application and in someone else's name. The $275 fee on that hasn't been paid either. So in the end someone had a nice joke that they played on all of us but neither of these trademarks are official. They are just filled out applications.</div></div><hr />

I would totally play that game. They would kill us with cuteness.<br />
<br />
<br />
Okay so I am going to explain this for everyone in debate. The Dark Below application wasn't even made by Blizzard. It was just someone that wanted to play a joke. It hasn't been submitted as a real trademark. The $550 fee has NOT been paid. The Corgis Unleashed trademark isn't real either. That was just Blizzards attempt to show everyone how easy it is to fill out a trademark application. The $275 fee on that hasn't been paid either. So in the end someone had a nice joke that they played on all of us but neither of these trademarks are official. They are just filled out applications.<br />
<br />
Actually, I think Boub did the Corgis Unleashed. He said you can even file the Trademark under other names. So he faked it looking like a Blizzard one just to prove that these trademark requests can be faked by ANYONE to look like they were Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

You're probably right about that now that I think about it. Either way, none of these applications have been submitted or were created by Blizzard.<br />

In this The dark Below application stood under Class: 2 and the fee that would have to be paid would have been 550 (2x 275) does this mean corgis was submitted as the second whatever &quot;class&quot; refers to or were there two trademarks apllied for with the dark below application? i dont understand what this &quot;class&quot; is.<br />

It hasn't been paid nor has it been submitted. It just a filled out application...nothing more.</div></div><hr />

Therefore, it's quite possible that we won't see any trademark filings in the US for the next WoW expansion until after the reveal at Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) The Dark Below application was posted (who did the application, no one knows, it hasn't actually been filed yet)<br />
2) Boub COMPLETELY MADE UP the Corgie Unleashed application to PROVE you didnt have to file it and could put anything you wanted showing that &quot;The Dark Below&quot; MAY NOT be legit<br />
3) Another guy did the same thing Boub did proving once again it COULD BE fake<br />

Does the status of the &quot;Dark Below&quot; alleged trademark differ from that of trademarks for previous expansions at the time that they were reported on MMOC?<br />

To try to clairfy a bit, so &quot;The Dark Below&quot; is not actually registered yet, only applied for. Were the trademarks for say, Cata and MoP only applied for as well when they were reported by MMOC?<br />
<br />
If they were, then there is still no actual reason to doubt the validity of it. The fact that it's easily possible to falsify information at the patent and trademark office merely shows yet another ineptitude of the US government, but would be merely coincidental. <br />

If the trademarks for MoP and Cata and others were already actually registered instead only applied for at the time of their reporting, then maybe some guns were jumped. <br />

<br />
2. NUMBER OF CLASSES: You must pay for each class of goods and/or services in the application. For example, if the application is for one mark but the mark is used on goods in two different classes, such as computer software in Class 9 and t-shirts in Class 25, then a filing fee for two classes is required before the application could be approved.<br />
<br />
http://www.uspto.gov/trademarks/teas/initial_app.jsp<br />
<br />
And i looked up the trademark of mop and swa that it had two &quot;goods and services&quot; so it would have been &quot;two classes&quot; when they apllied for the trademark. For the game it selfe and the website and such things. So at least it would make sense that in the application for the dark below the had &quot;Number of classes: 2&quot;</div></div><hr />

This Tumblr blogger has uncovered trademark applications filed by Blizzard in the fields of computer games, paper-based products, and online entertainment services. Those trademarks are on the USPTO's website, and we can confirm that Rod A. Rigole has been employed by Blizzard as legal counsel previously, so these trademark applications, all filed late last week on June 26th, are all real.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing that has changed is that MMOC has demonstrated that any idiot with free time and a wish to troll tens of thousands of people can file a fake application without paying money or any other kind of vetting process. Corgis Unleashed is fake. It was filled by MMOC to demonstrate how easy it is to falsify a trademark application. It was meant to prove a point, and it did. <br />
<br />
This means that The Dark Below may or may not be a real thing actually filed by Blizz. Since it was filed before this information was made widely known as it is at this moment, it still stands to reason that it's probably legit, at least to some extent. <br />
<br />
It also means woe unto us if The Dark Below *isn't* genuine. Because now there will probably be a wave of fake applications sent in Blizz's name by various trolls. So when the *real* thing does finally come along (if TBD isn't real) then we'll have no fucking clue what to make of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It matches previous already registered trademarked expansions from Blizz, and that Rod Riogle guy seems to check out. I suppose the information could have just been CnP'd from previous trademarks, but that's still a lot of trouble to go to in order to get off a joke. Not to mention, that person would have to have known then what we all know now, which is that any idiot can fake a trademark application.</div></div><hr />

That weird looking shape is what we call an eye, which looks uncannily similar to C'thun, who is an old god, which matches up with N'zoth who is ALSO an old god who would be in this &quot;Dark Below&quot; or IS the Dark Below.</div></div><hr />

Look at those tentacles up close in the new pic. Really well done. It's not some quick photoshop job.<br />

They are 3D and interacting with the border. I'm sure it's actually an animation. The tentacles probably crawl through the logo.</div></div><hr />

Funny because I just searched it and it does say 85 with last active 4 days ago.</div></div><hr />

It's supposed to be the eye of an Old God. Look up C'thun, he basically looked like that.</div></div><hr />

Even a basic look at the logo font will show how borked that fake video title was. Not to mention getting the title *wrong*, and all the other problems. Yet people still accept it!<br />
<br />
Just goes to show how easy it is to dupe people into believing falsehoods. I'm not saying that &quot;The Dark Below&quot; isn't the expansion title. It very well may be. But there were people on this board claiming 100% certainty that it must be true, and one guy betting his whole house, family, etc. on it. And the evidence was easily fakeable.<br />
<br />
If nothing else, this has been a good experiment to show how easy it is to start conspiracy theories.</div></div><hr />

<br />
my point still stands that its always had azeroth in the background. ive never seen a logo without it. my last issue with this image is that this photo was taken with a cell phone so you wouldnt notice the imperfections in it from the photoshopping. if it was really legit the person would have taken a screenshot instead.</div></div><hr />

I was honeslty thinking N'Zoth</div></div><hr />
