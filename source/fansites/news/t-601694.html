<br />
I, for one, am very interested in this, since I never even got close to Naxx back in the day. Would be quite a nice nod of the head to the raiders who never got a chance to try Naxx at level 60 cap. Plus, this also means the entry level raid will be a 25-man, which I think is a much more appropriate way to begin, allowing guilds to start raiding at full strength and be used to working in 25 person groups instead of 10 person.</div></div><hr />

I am one of these people. I never had a chance to do Naxx, however I dont really care that I skipped it. I do have a problem with the devs using prior content and charging more for an &quot;expansion&quot;. Imaging being charged 40 bucks for a level 80 2-man limit Gnomeregan. <br />

Whats the point when you can take 25 people into Naxx now and complete it, possibly less at level 80?</div></div><hr />

Ehem... to answer your question... Becuase its FUN period<br />
<br />
You play a game because its fun, as u go into a instance, because its FUN, its as easy as that, naxx is awsome, new items, more gameplay + one of the best instance ever, probbly with new bosses = fun for the whole family</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
I just came up with exactly those questions.<br />
<br />
Do they really want do move the whole instance? Will there be something like &quot;the little sister of Naxxramas&quot; in the Plaguelands? I mean, they can't just remove it. Because, if they do, there will be no T3 anymore. No Atiesh, etc. <br />
<br />
What i really wanna know is:<br />
<br />
1. Will there be a new T-Set in the &quot;new&quot; Naxxramas? (Clearly yes, but hey, someone's gotta ask it)<br />
2. Will we be able to loot the piece of Atiesh from Kel'thuzad on Level 80? And if so, will Atiesh be tuned for Level 80 as well? (I just want that Staff for my priestess / And i think too few people had that staff on Level 60)<br />
3. -&gt; Again if so, will the second piece of Atiesh still be on C'thuns loottable?<br />
4. Considering you can't just duplicate the instance and rename the bosses (unique and stuff), where will T3 be obtainable?<br />
<br />
Oh and, look at my signature before saying my english is bad ^^</div></div><hr />

It's already been established that the Corrupted Ashbringer can never be restored, it would have to be reforged anew. Should a pure Ashbringer make it into WotLK, I'd wager it'd be a Paladin exclusive legendary weapon, provided of course that they decide to make it wieldable at all by the players.</div></div><hr />

Those that were good enough at level 60 probably still have got the skills to progress beyond Naxx quick once they reach 80, so it won't really be &quot;boring, old content&quot; to them.</div></div><hr />

I never really understood that. Naxxramas is the supposed to be the seat of Kel'Thuzad, yet you fight him in Northrend?<br />

EDIT: I think the &quot;windows&quot; are meant to be portals to Northrend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But Kel'thuzud is the leader of all Lorderon scourge forces, but i guess since he was *defeted* Maybe hes pulling back the Necropolis so he can regain his power? Or maybe the Necropolis have been given much more important mission in Northrend?<br />
<br />
And yeah those are soppuse to be portals at the final level, he summons Neubians from them.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. As a matter of principle, the current &quot;level 60&quot; Naxxramas should not be replaced by the &quot;level 80&quot; Naxxramas. I would be content if they made the new one a heroic dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't mind if they are obsolete, and I don't mind if Andonisus is nothing, they were legendary and great weapons in their moment (and place).<br />
I am telling that there are 9 legendary weapons (counting Frostmourne, Ashbringer and The future ranged weapon), and only one is for casters. They should change that. I don't know how. But they should change it.</div></div><hr />

I do hope you can upgrade the staff (Ateish) in some way, and I think they'll keep the old Naxx, but lore wise it'll be in the past (just still there for convenient reasons, and players who feel nostalgic). Guys, this time, let's not fail to kill Kel Thuzad properly :-)<br />

<br />
what i HOPE:<br />
<br />
- that they dont tune it too easy ( like maulgar/gruul niveau for then-blue equipped would be great)<br />
- that they dont remove or greatly retune the mechanics of the boss (like thaddius, patch, instructor) where they dont HAVE to (4HM)<br />

By &quot;in the past&quot; I mean it belongs to the lvl 60 raids, and that was an attempt to kill Kel Thizad that failed, since I doubt they'll remove the current Naxx, the new Naxx will be the present one (hard to follow, I know...) therefore the current naxx will be the 'old' naxx and belong to the (recent) past.

10 mans! 10 mans! 10 mans! 10 mans...<br />
<br />
<br />
Please god no. Kara was only popular because it was entry level content. Hopefully naxx will be the new kara and we won't have an easy 10 man with better than Naxx loot.</div></div><hr />

Naxx being Naxx a 10man would suck lore wise too, I mean it's already going to be the easy part of the future raids, and it would be ridiculous to make it easy enough for a 10man raid, naxx has to remain somewhat of a challenge.<br />
<br />
If your guild can't do a 25man it's time for them to consider recruiting srsly</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Malineros</div><div class="date">2007-08-08, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10-person entry raids also create trouble getting a full 25-person team ready for the later raids, especially in smaller, slightly more casual guilds. If one group progresses faster through the 10-person content and is ready for the next (25-person) raid well before the other, you're at a roadblock. 10-person raids are fine, and fun, but from now on, I think it would be best if they remain side offers, kind of parallel in level/difficulty to 25-person content. Splitting a raid group into smaller raids is trouble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it is a legendary weapon, isn't it?<br />
<br />
Yeah but it's useless.<br />
You can also add the 7 legendary weapons from Kael'Thas Encounter...<br />
<br />
Btw, you said casters have only 1 legendary weapon, but Healing Pals/Shams don't have any.</div></div><hr />

I didn't count them because, the weapons were made for all types of players, if I said, there are 16 weapons and only two for caster it should have the same effect.<br />
And you are fight with that of healing pals and shamans.</div></div><hr />

However, the Argent Dawn reports that they never received the phylactery. It would thus appear that Montoy's true master is not the Argent Dawn at all, but so far nothing is known about his motivations. <br />

Probably the set up for the new Naxx</div></div><hr />

Confused...<br />
a) this conversation is too split now to be sure your not talking about some particular someone said<br />
b) the main topic is totally within lore. Naxx came from Northrend, Kel'Thuzad's phylactery was clearly never delivered to AD for destruction, so he will have regenerated.<br />
<br />
And I anticipate they will leave 60 Naxx where it is, as the story when we go to Northrend is further along the timeline than the recent Scourge invasion, however, for new people coming up in the game, you leave the old stories in Azeroth intact as much as you can to preserve that progressive story (minus actually experiencing the invasion - which was fun even though it could have been richer).<br />
<br />
If you meant something specific, please quote and/or explain.</div></div><hr />

The easiest resolution so far is to just retitle the current Naxx &quot;The Necropolis,&quot; leave everything as is, and then put a fresh new Naxxramas in Northrend w/ new and similar bosses tuned for lvl 80 25-man raiding. This way, Blizz further's the lore, and existing content isn't lost completely on the nostalgia nuts.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gatri</div><div class="date">2007-08-13, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">if u think about it if kel'thuazd is the leader of naxx is shouldn't be in Northrend because when Arthas went to Northrend to see the Lich king, Arthas said to Kel'thuazd to stay behind and watch over his kingdom (the Plaguelands). so if Kel'thuazad is in naxx it should be in the plaguelands.<br />
<br />
don't get me wrong i like the idea but it dose not fit in with lore.</div></div><hr />
