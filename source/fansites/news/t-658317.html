Hunter Q&amp;A with Ghostcrawler and the World of Warcraft Community Team<br />
<br />
Community Team: We’d like start this Q&amp;A off by asking a question that players of all classes often ask in regard to the very purpose of their class. In this case, we’re looking specifically at the hunter.<br />
<br />
Q: Where do hunters fit into the larger scope of things currently and where do we see them going from this point forward?<br />
<br />
A: We solved a lot of perennial hunter problems in Wrath of the Lich King, from the shot clipping problems of Steady Shot, to bringing Survival back to life, and making pet choice and training a lot more meaningful and hopefully enjoyable. Going forward we have several objectives we still want to accomplish. We want to make sure hunters in PvP are as good in Arenas as they are in Battlegrounds. We think their damage is sufficient, so we want to focus on their survival and crowd control. We want to make sure their PvE utility is as good as their dps (especially making traps live up to their potential for crowd control). We want to resolve what a hunter is supposed to do in melee (Raptor Strike? Disengage?).<br />
<br />
We want to clean up some of the clunkiness that still exists around pet control (both the UI itself and what the pet does on the battlefield). We think hunters have a good niche as the only real ranged damage-dealer that focuses on (mostly) physical damage based on a weapon rather than cast-time based spells. We just want to make sure they live up to that niche.<br />
<br />
Q: It was stated that we had intended to remove consumable ammunition from the game for patch 3.1.0, However, due to certain functionality not being ready in time, the change was put on hold. Is there any new information in regards to the functionality of non-consumable ammunition, and also a possible estimate as to when hunters may expect to see these changes implemented?<br />
<br />
A: From a technical standpoint, what happened is that the quiver is considered a bag just like other bags on the character but also, most critically, those in the bank. In order to remove ammo we would have to move the location of all of a character’s bank slots on the database that stores all of the World of Warcraft characters, which would be a risky thing to do in the middle of an expansion, and could result in “missing stuff” issues if something went wrong. It was just one of those last-minute show-stoppers.<br />
<br />
We still want to make ammo more of a gear choice than a consumable. We’re not sure if this would be as simple as getting the 125 dps arrows to upgrade your 120 dps arrows, or if you would do things like swap between your fire and poison arrows??? but that kind of thing is definitely on the table.<br />
I’m not sure when we can do it right. It’s not going to be for 3.2 unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Q: On the topic of hunter ammunition, currently, it becomes quite expensive for hunters to purchase Mammoth Cutters and Saronite Razorheads, especially given how much many hunters use in a given week. Are there any plans to reduce the cost, by potentially looking into the materials required to craft both types of ammunition?<br />
<br />
A: The problem with upgrading hunter ammo currently is how we work the progression. We don’t want to drop ammo on bosses for what I hope are obvious reasons so long as they are consumed. We need to have ammo improve as other gear improves, however, or the hunter overall starts to fall behind. Therefore there has to be some barrier that stops freshly leveled hunters from getting the best ammo while letting cutting-edge hunters procure it. In Burning Crusade, we handled this through a reputation grind, but it still wasn’t a very satisfying answer. In Wrath of the Lich King, we went with Engineer-crafted ammo and more recently changed the way ranged weapons scaled so that they would keep improving even if the ammo did not.<br />
<br />
For 3.2 we lowered the cost of the ammo quite a bit -- only 4 gold for a stack to manufacture. If you were paying 50 gold a night, that should drop to say 16 gold a night. Long-term this won’t be a problem because arrows won’t be consumed.<br />
<br />
Q: While we had previously reduced the range of the hunter's dead zone, it's still brought up as a concern. Is it possible to remove the dead zone completely? If this is not something under current consideration, what are the current design philosophies and balance reasons behind keeping this particular mechanic in-game?<br />
<br />
A: It’s possible to do so technically, but something we aren’t likely to do. Personally I think calling the current implementation a dead zone is just confusing and trying to sell the problem as worse than it is. Back in the day there was an actual distance at which neither ranged nor melee attacks would work – it was a dead zone. Currently there is just a minimum range for most ranged attacks. The way we want the hunter to work is that when you get into min range with the hunter, then the hunter needs to switch to melee, or more likely escape back to ranged distance again. We certainly don’t want the hunter to unload with both melee and ranged attacks at once – that might make them operate better at melee than range. Casters by contrast don’t have to do this, though it is often in their best interest to do so since their cast can get delayed or even interrupted by melee attacks. You can argue it’s goofy to be firing bows or rifles at point-blank range, but really it gets more into how we want the hunter (and all ranged weapon attacks) to work.<br />
<br />
I’ll add that the melee attack issue for hunters themselves is something we keep discussing. While we are unlikely to go back to a melee-focused build for hunters, we might consider a model where hunters don’t run away most of the time but switch to melee attacks – perhaps even a single punishing attack on a cooldown before the hunter Disengaged or whatever. This would be one of those things that helped hunters feel more different than actual magic casters, and might make them care about melee weapons as more than stat sticks. Additional feedback from the community on this sort of thing would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
Q: Would we consider allowing auto-shoot to work while moving? If there aren't plans for that specific change, is there anything in the works that will assist hunter dps in fights where a great deal of movement becomes necessary?<br />
<br />
A: Moving should feel like a penalty. We don’t want ranged attackers constantly circle strafing FPS-style because it confers a defensive advantage without giving up an offensive one. Moving is supposed to be bad and how you handle it is a test of your skill. We do give instant cast spells to some classes, but it should always be a dps loss when they have to focus on these exclusively. We would consider giving hunters another way to pull off an instant shot or beef up their dots, but we would want to make sure these would only be used in true long-distance movement situations. What I mean by that is we think we’ve possibly already gone too far towards balancing the Arena around instant attacks that can’t be countered before they go off.<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any long term plans to possibly removing the need for hunters to rely on a different resource system then mana?<br />
<br />
A: I hate to do this to you, but this is a great BlizzCon question. For these Q&amp;As, we’d like to keep the focus on each class’s current status and short-term plans, but at BlizzCon we’ll be happy to go into some more detail on our long-term vision for them.<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to increase the benefit hunters gain from haste?<br />
<br />
A: There are two ways to answer this question. The more general one, which applies to all classes, is that we want haste to be a useful stat. Rogues, warriors, and some casters like it currently, and we need to get it there for everyone. As I have said in several of the Q&amp;As, some stats have just fallen away from some specs even though they routinely appears on your gear. Sometimes this happens because talents prop up other stats so much that instead of being more attractive, they feel mandatory, and the ones that aren’t supported go from sub-optimal to junk status. We need the ability to put a variety of stats on your gear. We don’t want there to be an uber stat for anyone that trumps everything else to the point at which you don’t even look at the other stats. Gear is supposed to be a choice. I’ll say again that I think the online community sometimes focuses too much on the best-in-slot mentality, to the extent at which they consider everything except those BiS items to be worth skipping over. Remember, if it improves your dps, it’s an upgrade, even if another item would improve it more. That sounds so obvious, but I think there is a tendency for some players to stop thinking that way.<br />
<br />
Now for hunters specifically, we think the class is just too cooldown limited, which creates problems with haste. We’ve driven in that direction in order to give hunters a more interesting rotation, and to be fair, we feel like we’ve done that. But being cooldown limited isn’t necessarily a fun way for the class to play and we think it’s one of those things that makes hunters feel more like casters than like ranged-weapon users. (Hunters are casters in the sense that they’re ranged dps, but we still want the emphasis to be on the gun or bow.) More on this at BlizzCon, too.<br />
<br />
Q: How do we feel about the current state of stings? Are there any improvements planned for the way stings work, such as removing them from a shared global cooldown (GCD)? Are there current plans to improve individual stings?<br />
<br />
A: The best way to describe stings is we want them to feel like warlock curses. They should be a meaningful part of your rotation and something you should want to keep up. We understand that some of the stings are much more attractive than others (though to be fair, curses have a similar problem) and we need to make the less-popular stings more useful or just end up cutting them. We aren’t likely to remove any damage-dealing ability from the GCD and we’ve even taken a second look at whether we have removed too many defensive abilities from the GCD. It’s there for a reason, particularly in a client-server based game with inherent Internet lag.<br />
<br />
Q: Beast Mastery falls behind Marksmanship and Survival in regards to DPS, especially when the pet dies, due to how much damage comes from the pet when specialized in the Beast Mastery talent tree. Do we have plans to bring the potential damage the Beast Mastery tree offers to be more on par with what's currently possible with Survival and Marksmanship?<br />
<br />
A: Ideally, we want Beast Mastery to be able to do competitive damage with Survival and Marksmanship. Realistically with dps classes, it’s a math problem, and one tree nearly always edges out the other ones in most situations. That doesn’t mean we stop trying, but it also means we have to be realistic about what it will take to really get the specs to within 1% dps of each other, which is sometimes the point I fear we’d need to hit.<br />
<br />
The buffs to Catlike Reflexes and Wild Hunt were intended to boost Beast Mastery a little without causing every hunter in the game to swing back to Beast Mastery the way they all swung to Survival a few patches ago. We don’t necessarily like buffing Beast Mastery through the pet all the time. However, Beast Mastery also doesn’t have a signature attack like Chimera or Explosive Shot. At the same time, we don’t necessarily want to give them one because then Arcane Shot risks just vanishing from the hunter rotation. But, we can’t just buff Arcane Shot (unless it is very deep in Beast Mastery) because Survival and Marks use that too. See the problem? Ultimately the tree is supposed to be about pets, so we would rather make the pet easier to control and give the hunter ways to get the pet out of trouble so that they don’t face the profound dps loss of pet death. And even then, having a pet that is 50% or more of your dps is always going to have design problems, so we can’t go overboard. Beast Mastery and Demonology (and even the Unholy death knight) are going to be at a greater loss when their pet dies. That’s just the cost of having a more powerful pet.<br />
<br />
Q: In regards to the survivability to hunter pets are there plans to make additional improvements? The resilience change should help somewhat in PvP, however in end-game PvE environments, the hunter's pet can die pretty easily, especially given the specific encounter. One suggestion made by many hunters was to add a passive ability that healed the hunter's pet when the hunter received a heal from a party or raid member.<br />
<br />
A: Honestly, we aren’t happy with some of the current solutions to keeping pets alive. In particular, the area damage avoidance mechanics just don’t work well. They are frustrating for other players in a PvP setting when Bladestorm or Arcane Explosion can’t really hurt pets, and they don’t keep pets alive on a 5 million damage Mimiron missile. What we really need is a system where certain PvE attacks just don’t hurt the pet (maybe they can’t set off Mimiron mines for instance). We don’t want players to have to pay the price because the pet AI is in fact just an AI. This is something we’re working on.<br />
<br />
We’d rather not have to come up with additional mechanics needed to heal pets or keep them alive. We’d rather just the pet didn’t die in situations where a player that can make intelligent choices wouldn’t have died. Hunters do have abilities to heal or rez pets, and those ideally should be sufficient.<br />
<br />
Q: As a follow-up to the previous question, do we have plans to make it easier for the hunter to bring a dead pet back to life, such as reducing the casting time of the base ability?<br />
<br />
A: We talk about this a lot, but the trade off would be a much more fragile pet. In some ways we think a system might work better where the pets were easy to kill, especially in PvP, but the hunter (or warlock) could bring them back say every 30 seconds or so without a huge loss to personal dps. But in that situation, we would nerf pet health quite a bit so that the pets would crumple quickly when focused. The death knight (especially with an unglyphed Ghoul) works a little more like this currently – they have like 12K health without the glyph. But to make this change we would have to solve the PvE pet-gibbing mechanics referenced above.<br />
<br />
To be clear, this is a hypothetical different model than I’ve been talking about in the rest of this Q&amp;A. I don’t want to confuse anyone by saying pets should both be hard to kill and hard to rez, and easy to kill and easy to rez.<br />
<br />
Q: The Cunning pet-type was originally designed to be optimal for PvP use, however, most hunters feel that the Cunning pet-type falls short. How do we feel about the current state of what Cunning pets are offering, and are there any current plans to make improvements?<br />
<br />
A: We made an effort in 3.1 to get the Cunning pets up to speed by giving them talents like Roar of Sacrifice, and normalizing all of the pet stats so that Cunning pets had the same stats as the other two types, modified by pet talents. Crabs are still fairly popular and they probably should be a Cunning pet given their crowd control ability, but the carapace also made them feel like they should be able tanks. And selfishly, I had no problem with seeing a lot of crab pets. (No, I’m not serious.)<br />
<br />
This is something we would love to see more feedback on. Hunters in the online community tend to focus a lot on overall PvE dps or overall PvP survival and not get too much into pet comparisons. Someone theorycrafts the best pet and then hunters just go and get it instead of discussing what the other pets would need to be more competitive. To be fair, there is some of that discussion, but it’s not always easy to find, and I have looked. It’s not super high priority given some of the other hunter design issues we’re looking at, but we do want pets to be a choice.<br />
<br />
Q: Due to the number of abilities available to hunters, many level 80 players have expressed concerns in regards to placing all necessary abilities on their action bars. Are there any improvements coming that will assist hunters with this particular issue?<br />
<br />
A: We recognize this as a problem. We need to get more buttons off of the bar. We made some progress with streamlining say tracking and aspects, but we’re not there yet.<br />
<br />
Q: Additionally, do we plan to expand upon the number of pet action bar slots? Due to the current number of slots available for pets, hunters frequently have to swap pet abilities in and out of their spell/ability book.<br />
<br />
A: Yes, we definitely want to do this. The whole pet bar needs a little work. There are still some bugs relating to which abilities can be moved on or off the bar and whether they default to autocast or not. We want the bar to work much more like character action bars.<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any plans to allow Tranquilizing Shot to play a larger role in the hunter's arsenal?<br />
<br />
A: Consider that on the one hand this ability just used to be for Magmadar, and on the other hand I just acknowledged above that hunters have a lot of abilities to manage. Given that, we don’t really want Tranquilizing Shot to be in your rotation like Steady Shot or even Kill Shot. It’s a bit situational, and we’re fine with that. We did make some recent efforts to make Enrages feel more like a major mechanic that you’d want to dispel the way you dispel magic and other effects. Enrages aren’t fully realized that way yet, but we like the way that overall design could potentially work.<br />
<br />
Q: Do we have plans to increase the number of stable slots available to hunters?<br />
<br />
A: Obviously we increased it a lot in Wrath of the Lich King. We want to try and keep the pet as some kind of decision -- they aren’t supposed to be like mounts or titles where you just collect as many as you want. We expanded the size so that players could have say a Tenacity pet for soloing and a Ferocity pet for raiding, but we don’t want every hunter to have every family available here. Now one potential problem are the Spirit Beasts, which are collected by hunters and not trivial to replace. We have also discussed expanding the Spirit Beast concept to have rare skins of other pet families (that otherwise don’t convey a combat bonus). If we do that, we’d probably have to expand the stable slots.<br />
<br />
We’ve also considered a model where the hunter doesn’t even need a stable and can work more like a warlock where they can just summon their pets whenever they want -- with the remote stable ability from the dual-spec feature, we’re pretty close to that already. If we went this route then maybe the stable could just become pet storage in the same way your bank has all those Invader’s Scourgestones and Zul’Gurub bijous that you don’t use often but can’t bear to part with.</div></div><hr />

Not a bad start. Not a complete question dodging session as was expecting.<br />

But still no real dates and facts.<br />

I like the idea of hunters having a little more melee utility, like a big attack before moving away to punish range closers.<br />

Traps are still lackluckster though,...why cant we just target and throw em at people, instead of laying them down and hoping they get walked into.</div></div><hr />

really this is dissapointing though, they really did run away from any real fixes. only thing we got out of it other then them saying arrows may not be consumed in the next expansion is that they want a better melee attack...</div></div><hr />

We can assume he's referring to the base commands with this? Attack, Stay, Passive, Defend, etc. I'm not sure I know of any situation where having the pet on Aggressive is a good thing, but I can't take it off the bar either. That goes for both my Hunter and Warlock. At the risk of sounding negative, I'm a little shocked this is still an issue after almost 5 years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Moving should feel like a penalty.&quot; Excuse me... but.. the only shots most hunters use in PvP are explosive, arcane, sting, aimed/multi, and kill.

<br />
Q: Are there any plans to allow Tranquilizing Shot to play a larger role in the hunter's arsenal?<br />
<br />
A:Consider that on the one hand this ability just used to be for Magmadar, and on the other hand I just acknowledged above that hunters have a lot of abilities to manage. Given that, we don’t really want Tranquilizing Shot to be in your rotation like Steady Shot or even Kill Shot. It’s a bit situational, and we’re fine with that. We did make some recent efforts to make Enrages feel more like a major mechanic that you’d want to dispel the way you dispel magic and other effec</div></div><hr />

<br />
???<br />
<br />
I thought it was fine. The fact remains that the Q&amp;A isn't going to actually reveal anything mind-blowing. The only thing I'm curious about now is what they'd actually plan to do with the resource of the Hunter.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the Hunter's mana bar isn't really bad. It works well. I just can't see how a Hunter would work with an energy bar. And making a brand-new resource for Hunters only seems to just be wasteful and time-consuming. I'd rather they just work out simple fixes with ammo and just work with the mana pools we have now. I'd just really dislike the idea that Hunters would have to learn a brand-new resource mechanic from 80 to 90, let alone trying to make it work from 1 to 80...bleh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, I think it likely goes farther than that. Look at the work they recently did on the shaman totem bar. Go ahead and create a pre-made shaman if you have to in order to see it. Now imagine the same thing for pets.<br />
<br />
There's a row of buttons. The first and last are &quot;different&quot;. The first is an expression of your active intent -- for shamans, &quot;I am in the mode of dropping my DPS totems&quot;, or &quot;I am in the mode of dropping my healing totems&quot;, or &quot;I am in the mode of dropping my PvP totems&quot;, or whatever. The last button is an &quot;undo&quot;. And the middle are individual &quot;slots&quot;.<br />
<br />
Each button except the last has a little triangle at the top of it, and when you click on that part, a submenu draws upward with all the different options for things you can slot into that position. Do this on the first button and the different &quot;totem stances&quot; (so to speak) show up; picking one fills in all the other buttons with the totems you have configured for that &quot;stance&quot;. Do this on, for example, the air totem button, and all the available air totems show up, and picking one changes the one you have &quot;configured&quot; for your current &quot;stance&quot;.<br />
<br />
So now imagine that the first button is used to store and switch between &quot;pet configuration sets&quot;. So like you can switch between, say, &quot;soloing&quot;, &quot;PvE grouped&quot;, and &quot;PvP&quot;. Then the next slot over contains the default behavior of that pet (agressive, defensive, passive, maybe one or two more). The next slot over contains the default threat-related move (growl, cower, maybe one or two more). Then there are a few slots for specials in the order you want to use them. Maybe this can be prioritized, like, &quot;don't use an ability until you have enough Focus for the leftmost ability on the bar that is not on cooldown&quot;. And the last button is a complete &quot;recall&quot; -- &quot;stop attacking, stop using special abilities, stop 'stay'ing, and return to my side&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is all just a guess, yes, absolutely... but it's a guess based on what they just did for shaman totems.</div></div><hr />

A great Q&amp;A imho.<br />
<br />
To the people expecting answers like &quot;Yes, we agree that this is a problem, and have a magical solution ready to patch in on xx/xx/09.&quot; please: stop kidding yourself. That's not what these posts are about.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Excuse me... but.. the only shots most hunters use in PvP are explosive, arcane, sting, aimed/multi, and kill. They can burn someone down in a few seconds just from these instants.<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
<br />
Auto-shot/steady are rarely used, and when they are, they're just standing there not getting focused the entire time; or slowing you etc.<br />
<br />
That would be the idea behind hunters. However, that's why other classes aren't just NPCs. They have lots of interesting abilities, like Charge+hamstring, lolgrip+chains of lol, repentance/HoJ and from a caster point of view: fear, roots+melee, frost nova+melee, etc.<br />
<br />
Ranged classes as a whole are only performing their proper dps potential when stationary. Running is MEANT to be a detterent, and I'm guessing you haven't noticed but it is. Can you outdps a disc priest healing themself while running from a melee player? Now think, can you do it standing still (assuming they aren't moving or fearing)?</div></div><hr />

I would love to have Arrows or Bullets function like throwing weapons do currently.<br />
This way they can make them more interesting like indeed adding fire/poison damage or other cool tricks and buffs.<br />
<br />
Maybe bullets or arrows that work like Sigils/Librams/Totems. They could make it like:<br />
<br />
Poisonous Arrow Equip: Your Serpent Sting will last for 3 more seconds if refreshed by a Chimera Shot.<br />
Blasting Bullets &quot;A Goblin's Best Friend&quot; Equip: Your Explosive Shot has a 5% extra chance to crit.<br />
The Bullet That Turns Blood Into Candy &quot;Pets can't tell it's not the blood of your enemy&quot; Equip: Your pet will gnaw at the enemy's bullet/arrow wound, giving the pet an extra 10% armor penetration. Only works if the pet is an exotic breed.<br />
<br />
The problem with that is that they'd have to make bullets and arrows that work for three different specs differently. Not to mention the few specs that don't end up taking the end talent. [no exotic pets, maybe there's a build without Explosive Shot/Chimera Shot somewhere out there, etc...]<br />
<br />
Maybe they don't even need to keep the exclusivity of the bullets. Just flat increases in our normal abilities. [Steady, Aimed, Arcane...]</div></div><hr />

Up until last week I played in one of the best PvE guilds on my server as their only hunter, that was until I quit. Virtually every guild was recruiting hunters but there weren't any playing anymore. It's like Blizzard realises they're not fun to play, but can't really offer a fix until their &quot;long term goals&quot; come into fruition.<br />
<br />
I thought about re-rolling but just couldn't be bothered to level a character to 80, then persuade a good guild to let me raid with them. So I cancelled my account instead. May sound like 'QQ', but no real other choice if you're not finding it fun to play anymore.</div></div><hr />

When MM and Surv lose their pet they drop a huge part of their survival RoS/Pin/Intervene and a passive way to keep healers in combat. The pets as they are seem to be very weak and almost unable to be healed, even with resilience bleeding over I can see pets still being able to be gib'd in a 3-4s CC on a healer which in turn if it does live, it takes more damage then the hunter so the healing is even harder to come back from.<br />

Database-wise they just have to edit the item itself and assuming they're using good relational database practices, everything will &quot;just work&quot; and they won't have to go into people's banks. It's the same thing they did with the old quest items like the Urn from Kara and the Mallet from ZF(?). I don't think saronite arrows are THAT expensive where too many of us would QQ about having to vendor all of them (personally I have a nice supply stocked up but for this change would be HAPPY to vendor them all), but I guess Blizz could mail all hunters with a certain amount of saronite arrows (or bullets) the new version of the unconsumed arrow. Again, database-wise this shouldn't be a huge deal (they mass mailed the Mountain Dew Battle Bots to people who signed up so why not arrows to specific hunters?). Blizz Devs are just lazy.<br />
<br />
I really like the idea of different types of arrows like fire / poison / frost, etc. Or even make them add to different stats like crit arrows, pure damage arrows, haste arrows, etc. Maybe one that auto-applies a sting, but you loose out on the other advantages of arrows liek the aformentioned crit, haste, or whatever. Basically you'd be buying an extra GCD and a bit of mana every so often for some stats, which hunters can decide for themselves.</div></div><hr />

I think that they gave us more slots in Wrath and that, if they start adding more pet species like they've said, they'll add a few more slots next expansion, as well.<br />

I lol'd in the middle of the office at this.<br />
<br />
On topic, I hope that the different types of arrows that were mentioned actually go into practice. Making arrows similar to rogue poisons with different uses and situations would be an interesting concept.<br />
<br />
I wasn't a big fan of the Arcane Shot comments. The shot could be pretty easily balanced into a MM rotation by making it share a cd with Chimera just like ti does with explosive. Do they think they need to add a 4x damage multiplier to its current version to get it up to snuff for BM? They would have to crazily boost it for SV to even consider using it above ES.</div></div><hr />

What I'd rather see them do is give BM hunters a BM-ish shot. Like, a shot that places a debuff, such that all damage done by either hunters with this talent or exotic pets gets increased. Maybe some kind of &quot;hunter hemorrhage&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Crabs are still fairly popular and they probably should be a Cunning pet given their crowd control ability, but the carapace also made them feel like they should be able tanks. And selfishly, I had no problem with seeing a lot of crab pets. (No, I’m not serious.)<br />

I dont see why they dont give hunters more choice and freedom in pets by issuing all talent trees to all pets, but obv no mix specing , if you spend one point in one of the trees you can only spend your remaing points in that same tree.

This is what I found most interesting in this post. <br />
I really hope they add some sort of rhythm system, where certain shots such as steady shot “add” rhythm and kill shot removes rhythm. Also, when you move you start to slowly start to lose rhythm....i always liked this idea</div></div><hr />

Problem with that is that some pet abilities are more suited for tanking than DPS or vice versia.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't want to take a tanking wolf with the AP increase, for example, or the gorilla as my DPS machine with his pummel [used to be Thunderstomp]<br />
<br />
Plus, with the croc, their ability requires them to actually be hit, so that wouldn't work so well.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I like the system they have now...maybe instead, they could get rid of the cunning tree altogether and give those pets the option of tenacity or ferocity. But right now, cunning is just a standby. I'd love to take my bird out again if I could use her as a DPSer again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reduxx</div><div class="date">2009-07-23, 07:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: Beast Mastery falls behind Marksmanship and Survival in regards to DPS, especially when the pet dies, due to how much damage comes from the pet when specialized in the Beast Mastery talent tree. Do we have plans to bring the potential damage the Beast Mastery tree offers to be more on par with what's currently possible with Survival and Marksmanship?<br />
<br />
A: Ideally, we want Beast Mastery to be able to do competitive damage with Survival and Marksmanship. Realistically with dps classes, it’s a math problem, and one tree nearly always edges out the other ones in most situations. That doesn’t mean we stop trying, but it also means we have to be realistic about what it will take to really get the specs to within 1% dps of each other, which is sometimes the point I fear we’d need to hit.<br />
<br />
The buffs to Catlike Reflexes and Wild Hunt were intended to boost Beast Mastery a little without causing every hunter in the game to swing back to Beast Mastery the way they all swung to Survival a few patches ago. We don’t necessarily like buffing Beast Mastery through the pet all the time. However, Beast Mastery also doesn’t have a signature attack like Chimera or Explosive Shot. At the same time, we don’t necessarily want to give them one because then Arcane Shot risks just vanishing from the hunter rotation. But, we can’t just buff Arcane Shot (unless it is very deep in Beast Mastery) because Survival and Marks use that too. See the problem? Ultimately the tree is supposed to be about pets, so we would rather make the pet easier to control and give the hunter ways to get the pet out of trouble so that they don’t face the profound dps loss of pet death. And even then, having a pet that is 50% or more of your dps is always going to have design problems, so we can’t go overboard. Beast Mastery and Demonology (and even the Unholy death knight) are going to be at a greater loss when their pet dies. That’s just the cost of having a more powerful pet.<br />

Q: Do we have plans to increase the number of stable slots available to hunters?<br />
<br />
A: Obviously we increased it a lot in Wrath of the Lich King. We want to try and keep the pet as some kind of decision -- they aren’t supposed to be like mounts or titles where you just collect as many as you want. We expanded the size so that players could have say a Tenacity pet for soloing and a Ferocity pet for raiding, but we don’t want every hunter to have every family available here. Now one potential problem are the Spirit Beasts, which are collected by hunters and not trivial to replace. We have also discussed expanding the Spirit Beast concept to have rare skins of other pet families (that otherwise don’t convey a combat bonus). If we do that, we’d probably have to expand the stable slots.<br />
<br />
We’ve also considered a model where the hunter doesn’t even need a stable and can work more like a warlock where they can just summon their pets whenever they want -- with the remote stable ability from the dual-spec feature, we’re pretty close to that already. If we went this route then maybe the stable could just become pet storage in the same way your bank has all those Invader’s Scourgestones and Zul’Gurub bijous that you don’t use often but can’t bear to part with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but most of our moves are physical things. we steady our shots. we poison mobs. we trap things. we aim our shots. he give our pets a command to kill, we have a shot meant to kill. so many things physical in nature, yet were mana based. not saying energy or rage is the way to go, but mana made me go &quot;hmmm&quot;.<br />
<br />
i suppose one could argue the &quot;if it aint broke, dont fix it&quot; thing, but i guess that brings into question &quot;is it broked?&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nixia</div><div class="date">2009-07-23, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Moving should feel like a penalty. We don’t want ranged attackers constantly circle strafing FPS-style because it confers a defensive advantage without giving up an offensive one. Moving is supposed to be bad and how you handle it is a test of your skill. We do give instant cast spells to some classes, but it should always be a dps loss when they have to focus on these exclusively. We would consider giving hunters another way to pull off an instant shot or beef up their dots, but we would want to make sure these would only be used in true long-distance movement situations. What I mean by that is we think we’ve possibly already gone too far towards balancing the Arena around instant attacks that can’t be countered before they go off.<br />

<br />
<br />
That's because casters and hunters can keep shooting/casting at a moving mob/player while standing still. Melee can't quite stand still and hit a moving target. And when melee is hitting on you, you WILL (try) to move. If melee couldn't attack while moving, they'd be useless in near every aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Rogues can have two very specific class profession, why other classes have no &quot;profession of their own&quot;?<br />
<br />
If Hunters would be able to create ammo (consumable) by themselfves, Blizz could very easily balance it out. Either with BoE/BoP recipes dropped by bosses in raids, with a faction recipes at different reputation levels or even by class quests, done in 5m instances, 10m and/or 25m raids.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was short, sh*t and basically said nothing besides we might toss in a new thing or two..<br />
<br />
'We want to improve pets' while that's nice and all, the truth still remains, the pet that best fits the situation will be the majority of the population in a game performing either pvp, pve, or the odd leveling duty.. in BC, everyone and their mother had a cat. Now you'll notice a lot of people vying for wolves more now since they can stay at your side and buff.. and not die that way.<br />

Collored differently, but same model, same family.<br />
<br />
It's just sometimes not that much fun having the game decide on a pet for you, instead of you geting what you feel like, without losing that special skill some pets would have.<br />
What about dwarfs and bears, trolls and raptors, for example? <br />
As it is now, an arena pet will never be a bear, when you have other pets with so much more useful special skills... <br />
If pets ware seperated by a tree (ferocious, cunning, tenacity), like they are now, but each pet family of a selected tree would be given a choice of 1 skill (be it holding an oponent in a place like &quot;pin&quot; crabs have, or doing a sweep like a bear, etc.) then you will see parts of the game like arenas with a vast number of different pets, all to player's flavour, all with optimized use, instead of just 1 pet, everyone has to get in order to gain max benefit.<br />
<br />
example:<br />
Get a bear for an example, and learn the 1 special skill of your choice, from the tenacity family tree available. Like holding the oponent for 4 seconds (like crab's do), instead of the skill the bear has, sweep.<br />
That would make both bear and crab have the same use as a tenacity pet in both pvp AND pve, and would make it a player's choice of what he prefears to make his companion.<br />
(This WILL kill the individuality of pet families, tied to a current tree, but will make ANY pet of a desirable talent tree attractive to players of all aspects of the game)</div></div><hr />

Give them a break. It's a single slip. ::)Then that should've been noted. It's more evidence of a development team far out of touch with how Hunters actually work.<br />

I love how they completely ignored major issues like Hunters' dependency on Judgment of Wisdom (especially MM) to not spend stupid amounts of time in Viper, our need for both caster buffs AND melee buffs just to be at peak potential, the fact that Feign Death is STILL based off of Spell Hit (the Hit unification helped, but 8% Physical Hit != 17% Spell Hit), the fact that raiding Hunters are still shoehorned into one or two types of pets (and BM is basically shoehorned into only one from a raiding perspective - one with a HOST of issues), and how we're the lowest performing pure DPS class by a mile, getting outpaced regularly by several hybrid classes.

Not a bad start. Not a complete question dodging session as was expecting.<br />
<br />
But still no real dates and facts.<br />

I like the idea of hunters having a little more melee utility, like a big attack before moving away to punish range closers.<br />
<br />
Traps are still lackluckster though,...why cant we just target and throw em at people, instead of laying them down and hoping they get walked into.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So you want traps to be more like a..... non trap? Maybe it is just the mechanics of traps that fail, not the fact that players have to walk into them? Like there should be a proximity trigger that causes them to take effect, instead of players having to walk right into them.</div></div><hr />

What the heck did you want from a Q&amp;A session that had nothing else of interest from the other classes?<br />
<br />
I went in expecting no huge announcements. All I was expecting was them saying they're aware of issues. And that's good.<br />
<br />
For one thing, lay off Ghostcrawler. For god's sake, he gets enough flack just being there giving us the &quot;news&quot;. Stop treating everything he says like he either &quot;hates our class&quot;, &quot;doesn't know our class&quot;, or is simply &quot;too ignorant to be a class designer.&quot; In the end, Blizzard freakin' hired him, so give him some credit. <br />
You're making the &quot;Arcane Shot&quot; part way too big when it really doesn't matter. <br />
<br />
The stuff you've mentioned is stuff that's very hard to fix. [or, if they actually said they do want to fix it, then they don't, then they're liars as well as &quot;lazy developers&quot;] <br />
Marksman's mana problem is hard to figure because our mana pool is inherently slim even when our Intellect buffs our AP. If Marksman also creates perfect mana efficiency, then we fall upon the problem that we might overpass our other mana-using pure DPS classes simply because of our longevity. You say absurd amount of time is needed in Viper on fights, but I hardly see that. The time I'm in Viper is few and far between. Maybe that's because of the raid makeup, which means I'm very lucky to be in the guild raids I'm in.<br />
...you actually put &quot;our need for all buffs&quot; as a problem? I find that as a good thing. If our raid makeup doesn't have all these buffs, then we're probably not doing something right. At least, if that's what that whole &quot;bring the player, not the class&quot; motto is for. The very fact that we benefit from all of these buffs says something good for me. It means we benefit from stuff our caster DPS gets AND our melee DPS gets. We kinda get the best of both areas.<br />
Feign Death is still a complete aggro wipe compared to other situations with other classes. We're lucky enough to have that. I know a perfect aggro wipe would be nice all the time, but we're still damn lucky to have an imperfect aggro wipe. You're an Engineer, so I'm sure you're used to the whole &quot;failed mechanics&quot; shtick.<br />
We're shoehorned to using two types of pets because that new pet system is still fairly new. If it came out of the box perfect, then WoW would have so few of these issues. I'm sure the fact that they're looking into the Cunning tree stuff means they're hoping to find out how to make the pet talents better than they are now.<br />
And as for your last point, I go in wanting to DPS and I DPS. The fact remains that I still do enough damage to still be a viable piece of Marksmanship power! If I cared about the charts, then I would have switched long ago, just like you would've switched from Engineer to some other profession. It's all about what you want to do. And if I still end up in the top 10 of my raiding guild [who are all really good DPS, by the way], then I know I'm doing my job.<br />
But hey, that's just me.<br />
<br />
In the end, your complaints are valid, but very shortsighted. You went in thinking it should be like Christmas, but when you find out it's more like a random office party hosted by Michael Scott, you got upset. <br />
<br />
Put your chin up! Just because they didn't answer it in the Q&amp;A doesn't mean they're completely oblivious. They're hired to develop this game, after all...I think they know what to do. ::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey Ghostcrawler, how about you answer WHY ret paladins, and basically every other class destroys us in PvP, because it's damn impossible to stay in range with the stuns/CC?<br />
<br />
How about the fact that our traps are resisted half the time, and we have a million gimmicky spells and hardly any that have real utility?<br />
<br />
How about the fact that DKs can chains of ice me over and over, and when I disengage, pull me back, and then resist my trap? How about why their ghouls can have stuns, but they took away our explosive shot stun? Why do we need to spec BM to have any form of stun? Shouldn't that be a basic hunter ability, to keep your enemy at range?<br />
<br />
Way to sweep the PvP questions under the rug! We'll stay at 3% representation in arena because you don't know how to balance hunters and we'll continue to suck.<br />
<br />
Much less the PvE questions, like how it's so damn hard to keep my pet alive sometimes in Ulduar, and why some pets have absolute garbage skills and have no use or worth taming, and why BM's 60 point talent is bad because exotic pets are underpowered? Maybe if they did more damage, BM would be back up there.<br />
<br />
Why are we the &quot;pure&quot; DPS class that does the lowest out of the pures, and lower than many hybrid classes? Rogues get an absurdly overpowered AoE, but our volley cost is ridiculously high, and it got nerfed into the ground.<br />
<br />
Why did you nerf our trap talent, remove glyph of the monkey, and make aspect of the cheetah stun on hit? As a hunter, shouldn't we have aspect of the cheetah NOT have a stun, because we have natural speed (hence agility)? We're supposed to be the kiting class, but in the CC burstfest you call PvP, we're certainly not.<br />
<br />
Way to go dodging the important questions like you did with the warrior Q&amp;A.<br />
<br />
L2listentocommunity, Blizz. Just because YOU have a certain vision for a class, and feel as if something isn't right, doesn't mean that WE, the players, do as well.<br />
<br />
I kinda feel like we've been forgotten, and their focus is on the flavor of the month class.<br />
<br />
Inb4 &quot;L2P&quot;, &quot;Hunters are great in PvP&quot; and more elitist crap from people that don't even PLAY hunters. The fact that seeing a hunter above 2k is like seeing an eclipse of the sun says that something's wrong.</div></div><hr />

Oh look. Another terrible Q&amp;A in a string of terrible, PVP-centric Q&amp;As. <br />
<br />
I didn't even see them address that many pvp issues anyway. What did we get? Auto shot while moving, pets getting stomped in 2 gcds and our rez being horrible and the fact when other caster classes want to survive against us they run into our melee range. <br />
<br />
Really Blizzard, when people want to survive against us they run towards us instead of los cause our melee hits like a lvl 20 warrior. I never see shadow priests or warlocks running into a mages melee range to survive against them (Ignoring fear of course). Got to love mages who freeze u in place and then start hitting you for 2-4k while you get a 900 melee hit on a 3.2 sec swing timer. <br />
<br />
Imo this q&amp;a was horrible. It was just a bunch of we thought about that and didn't do it, or we might consider doing that later. And why did they buff a talent no one takes? Catlike reflexes. Seriously? You buffed that of all things?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, again, I said before, if they can't say anything they can promise, with a very good chance of failure, then they're better off not saying anything at all. The ammo stuff is the perfect example. The fact that they promised no more ammo costs in 3.1, then just add stacks of 1000 instead of 200. If they pulled something like that again, then Hunters would find themselves feeling like pushovers. They had to handle this Q&amp;A carefully.<br />
<br />
The fact that they didn't say anything doesn't mean they're oblivious of the class's problems. It just means that any methods they're thinking of aren't viewable by the public yet. They're not politicians. And they aren't trying to win you over with these changes. They can't just say, out of the blue, &quot;Hey, guys, the way we're going to go with the class is that pets are now INVINCIBLE to NPC and player attacks! Oh, and your wolf can be a mount now! And Marksman gets Spirit Beasts for the heck of it! Survival gets an Explosive Shot with a nuclear core! That's right, NUCULAR!&quot; <br />
<br />
All they want to do is give some insight on small issues they know they can talk about. Heck, the fact about the resource mechanic being mentioned is a big enough thing about Hunters that I'm surprised it got in there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyway, I find the comment on resource system to be of high interest. I didn't make it into close beta, but I do believe Hunters used Focus back then, and it only regenerates when they do not move. Hence Hunters were given mail armor, and Raptor Strike + Mongoose Bite (and Counterattack), all of which were a lot more significant back in the days.<br />
I think it would be interesting to return to the model. That way, they will have legitimate reasons to make Hunters much less squishy. And I daresay more stylish too.<br />
<br />
I don't see how they are not answering any PvP related questions either. One of the biggest PvP woe is the dead zone, and they did say quite a bit about it. They also mentioned about cooldown management, which they think is the main limitation for hunters. With some analysis, you can derive quite a bit of information from that. I don't think Bliz owes it to anyone to spoon feed you with memos from all of their meetings. Most developers don't even go this far in communicating with people.</div></div><hr />

If Arcane Shot is heavily buffed in an attempt to buff Beastmastery, it may get to the point where Arcane Shot is more powerful than Explosive Shot. If Arcane Shot is more powerful than Explosive Shot, then Survival Hunters will use the shared cooldown on Arcane Shot instead.<br />

<br />
Hey Ghostcrawler, how about you answer WHY ret paladins, and basically every other class destroys us in PvP, because it's damn impossible to stay in range with the stuns/CC?<br />
<br />
How about the fact that our traps are resisted half the time, and we have a million gimmicky spells and hardly any that have real utility?<br />
<br />
How about the fact that DKs can chains of ice me over and over, and when I disengage, pull me back, and then resist my trap? How about why their ghouls can have stuns, but they took away our explosive shot stun? Why do we need to spec BM to have any form of stun? Shouldn't that be a basic hunter ability, to keep your enemy at range?<br />
<br />
Way to sweep the PvP questions under the rug! We'll stay at 3% representation in arena because you don't know how to balance hunters and we'll continue to suck.<br />
<br />
Much less the PvE questions, like how it's so damn hard to keep my pet alive sometimes in Ulduar, and why some pets have absolute garbage skills and have no use or worth taming, and why BM's 60 point talent is bad because exotic pets are underpowered? Maybe if they did more damage, BM would be back up there.<br />
<br />
Why are we the &quot;pure&quot; DPS class that does the lowest out of the pures, and lower than many hybrid classes? Rogues get an absurdly overpowered AoE, but our volley cost is ridiculously high, and it got nerfed into the ground.<br />
<br />
Why did you nerf our trap talent, remove glyph of the monkey, and make aspect of the cheetah stun on hit? As a hunter, shouldn't we have aspect of the cheetah NOT have a stun, because we have natural speed (hence agility)? We're supposed to be the kiting class, but in the CC burstfest you call PvP, we're certainly not.<br />
<br />
Way to go dodging the important questions like you did with the warrior Q&amp;A.<br />
<br />
L2listentocommunity, Blizz. Just because YOU have a certain vision for a class, and feel as if something isn't right, doesn't mean that WE, the players, do as well.<br />
<br />
I kinda feel like we've been forgotten, and their focus is on the flavor of the month class.<br />
<br />
Inb4 &quot;L2P&quot;, &quot;Hunters are great in PvP&quot; and more elitist crap from people that don't even PLAY hunters. The fact that seeing a hunter above 2k is like seeing an eclipse of the sun says that something's wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well said.<br />
<br />
BM has been nerfed to the ground to the point where it's no longer a viable spec. <br />
<br />
WHY?<br />
<br />
We need better ammo. We need better mana. We need to not be pigeon-holed into choosing between a wolf and, A WOLF for raiding. We need for our traps to not be resisted. We need for blizzard to stop treating hunters like step-children for once.<br />
<br />
No offense to GC but, I learned that blizzard either doesn't care about hunters or they don't know how to make changes that will please a majority of the hunter community.<br />

That is a big problem.</div></div><hr />

Yes it was those 2 lockpicking for the obvious lockboxing.<br />

I am quite disapointed in the underpoweredness of the unique exotic pets, also te range of the fact we can't tame simple things like some of the dinosaurs in un'goro crater like the terrodactile. If your full BM you should have the freedom of roamng throughout a plenty of pets, or even better label some of the pets in the same family as a pet. Say the spiked crocolisks and a regular crocodile should be put in the same group and tamable.</div></div><hr />

How is this so difficult to understand?<br />
<br />
<br />
The amount that arcane shot would need to be buffed in order to out strip explosive as the preferred shot for survival is pretty massive. It's more likely that he simply spoke before he thought out his answer and bungled it big time. It happens.<br />
<br />
Instead of riding GC's jock and making excuses for him just let the man deal with the upset hunter community. He's a big boy and is capable of explaining himself.</div></div><hr />

Explosive Shot is 14% RAP + 425 damage<br />
Arcane Shot is 15% RAP + 428 damage<br />
<br />
The only Survival talents exclusive to Explosive Shot are TNT and Sniper Training.<br />
<br />
It's very possible that Arcane Shot would start outscaling Explosive Shot if the devs decided to make up all of BM's DPS deficits through that one ability.<br />
<br />
It's really very simple:<br />
1. BM does not have a Shot all its own<br />
2. You cannot pass the DPS buff into Exotic pets since that would force BM Hunters into Exotics<br />
3. Kindred Spirits and Serpent's Swiftness have already been through a roller-coaster ride trying to be the BM-exclusive buff for BM, with largely lackluster results<br />
<br />
All told, this means that the devs cannot currently think of a way to buff BM DPS in such a manner that would not buff the other specs' DPS as well.<br />
<br />
Yes, one could say that they do not have to buff everything through Arcane Shot, or that there are other possible solutions such as via Ferocious Inspiration. GC may have been vague, but you're deluding yourself if you think for a second that he wasn't aware that ES and AS did not share a cooldown.</div></div><hr />

That paints an incomplete picture, however, and ignores one fact that makes ES drastically outstrip AS if you have access to it: <br />
In one cooldown, Arcane Shot deals that damage once, and has one chance to crit. <br />

Agreed... However, on the bright side, most Death Knights and Rogues don't know wtf they are doing, seeing as all the little kids and noobs on their hunters decided to reroll the OP class instead.<br />
<br />
When Im in a BG I like to plant a Freezing trap at my back to keep any rogues and bay, and if any melee come at me, I simple run behind the trap, and hope they don't resist it.<br />
<br />
But when a DK gets a hold of me... with chains of ice and Death Grip, unless someone else is on him, its gg... BUT WAIT!!! Disengage! because Death Grip is on a Cooldown, because if you can't kill a DK within 40-1min while kiting him, YOU SUCK.<br />
<br />
When in doubt, mouse turn and DISENGAGE! keep a trap down when you land and run the other fucking way, Hunters have a longer range than a DKs Icy Chains OR Death Grip.<br />
<br />
Yes Im sorry to say this, but you have to have a brain to play a hunter well... it's true, it's true...</div></div><hr />

However, on the bright side, most Death Knights and Rogues don't know wtf they are doing, seeing as all the little kids and noobs on their hunters decided to reroll the OP class instead.<br />
<br />
When Im in a BG I like to plant a Freezing trap at my back to keep any rogues and bay, and if any melee come at me, I simple run behind the trap, and hope they don't resist it.<br />
<br />
But when a DK gets a hold of me... with chains of ice and Death Grip, unless someone else is on him, its gg... BUT WAIT!!! Disengage! because Death Grip is on a Cooldown, because if you can't kill a DK within 40-1min while kiting him, YOU SUCK.<br />
<br />
When in doubt, mouse turn and DISENGAGE! keep a trap down when you land and run the other fucking way, Hunters have a longer range than a DKs Icy Chains OR Death Grip.<br />
<br />
Yes Im sorry to say this, but you have to have a brain to play a hunter well... it's true, it's true...<br />
<br />
<br />
A bad DK death grips me before I disengage. A good one chains of ice me and runs over, and chains again if I escape from it. If I disengage, THEN he grabs me.<br />
<br />
The point is, a fantastic hunter against a fantastic ret paladin or DK (if they exist) would have no contest. Hunters are broken in PvP, and there's no two ways about it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Prinsesa</div><div class="date">2009-07-24, 09:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That paints an incomplete picture, however, and ignores one fact that makes ES drastically outstrip AS if you have access to it: <br />
In one cooldown, Arcane Shot deals that damage once, and has one chance to crit. <br />
In one cooldown, Explosive Shot deals that damage three times over 2 sec, and each of those three times has its own independent chance to crit. <br />
<br />
<br />
Be that as it may, there's still a number at which Arcane Shot is better than Explosive Shot. It's a high number (roughly a 180% buff excluding TNT and Sniper Training), but there's definitely a point of inflection nonetheless, which reflects what GC implied.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rokkitan</div><div class="date">2009-07-24, 11:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wish they made pets have a selection of family skills which are more generic but named after the pet, so each pet could have either a dps skill, a root skill, an interrupt skill or an aoe tanking skill (add a few more as desired; stun/). Example: a cat could choose from one of the following: rake(dps), grab(root), maim(interrupt), and flurry of claws(aoe tanking), while a spider could have posion bite(dps), web(root), web strangle(interrupt) and posion spray(aoe tanking). Then you could choose the pet from looks and spec it to do what you want. The talent tree could be used for this and we wouldn't have cunning/ferocity/tenacity trees/families. It would also make it much easier on the developers when introducing new pet families. Exotic pets could still have some exotic skills in addition. But I'd still want my cat to have prowl, but not sure how to integrate it without making it an exotic..<br />
<br />
When taking about pets; I wish they made pets have the hunter's level, and rather used happiness as a barrier to tame and throw away pets. This means that happiness would increase much more slowly. As it it now you can be so lucky to tame a pet at your own level or if not you have to level it, thus reducing the freedom of choice. Happiness loss is also something I'd love to get rid of, as I feel the pet talents and the glyph is just a band aid on a bad mechanic. Perhaps we could then be able to feed them to heal them instead.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: Let us choose pets from looks, and then choose skills for it's intended role.<br />
<br />
Removing consumable arrows and thus making dropped ammo have meaning will be nice. Hopefully it's work like idols/librams/sigils.. The old world has several ammo from boss drops and a few quests, which will then be usable for a leveling hunter. It'll be interesting to see what they implement, as they did many great changes for WotLK for hunters/pets.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ekoor</div><div class="date">2009-07-24, 11:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Great Q&amp;A, really...<br />
<br />
So, instead of actually addressing any of the problems that have been bugging hunters for months (Esp. damage dealing. No, it's not &quot;good&quot;, as he said), they're trying to throw the new, fancy Poison Ammo (or whatever) and a possible &quot;strong melee attack&quot; at us, as if we needed yet another situational lackluster ability. Typical.<br />
The pet survivability bit was especially ludicrous. As was stated, faster pet ress would mean an even &quot;more fragile&quot; pet... Well, their health can't go any lower than it already is...<br />
<br />
I honestly have no idea where they're going with this class, and the Q&amp;A was supposed to answer that. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What we really need is a system where certain PvE attacks just don’t hurt the pet (maybe they can’t set off Mimiron mines for instance). <br />
<br />
<br />
Since when do pets set off mimiron mines?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rocktard</div><div class="date">2009-07-24, 12:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: It was stated that we had intended to remove consumable ammunition from the game for patch 3.1.0, However, due to certain functionality not being ready in time, the change was put on hold. Is there any new information in regards to the functionality of non-consumable ammunition, and also a possible estimate as to when hunters may expect to see these changes implemented?<br />
<br />
A: From a technical standpoint, what happened is that the quiver is considered a bag just like other bags on the character but also, most critically, those in the bank. In order to remove ammo we would have to move the location of all of a character’s bank slots on the database that stores all of the World of Warcraft characters, which would be a risky thing to do in the middle of an expansion, and could result in “missing stuff” issues if something went wrong. It was just one of those last-minute show-stoppers.<br />
<br />
We still want to make ammo more of a gear choice than a consumable. We’re not sure if this would be as simple as getting the 125 dps arrows to upgrade your 120 dps arrows, or if you would do things like swap between your fire and poison arrows??? but that kind of thing is definitely on the table.<br />
I’m not sure when we can do it right. It’s not going to be for 3.2 unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Maybe I lost something in translation, but what is the hard part? They managed to change the rogue poisons before WotlK launched aswell. What is the difference compared to the arrows?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Khahla</div><div class="date">2009-07-24, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think he's implying that to change the ammo they were planning on deleting or changing old existing ammo including those that might have been in quivers in peoples banks...<br />
but god knows why this is such a showstopper, why not just leave old ammo? It would be subpar to the new stuff (or what's the point right) and would vendor or shoot itself out of existence...<br />
<br />
All you really need to know is it's a grade-A selection of classic Ghostcrawler Bull$#!%.<br />

I spent about 180g on ammo last night : /</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Selebrian</div><div class="date">2009-07-24, 03:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: Are there any long term plans to possibly removing the need for hunters to rely on a different resource system then mana?<br />
<br />
A: I hate to do this to you, but this is a great BlizzCon question. For these Q&amp;As, we’d like to keep the focus on each class’s current status and short-term plans, but at BlizzCon we’ll be happy to go into some more detail on our long-term vision for them.<br />
<br />
This is intriguing so possibly in the next expansion Hunters may not even be using mana? I would have expected a flat out &quot;No, we have no plans to change hunters resource system&quot;. But he didn't so ... very interesting.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Renegaid</div><div class="date">2009-07-24, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Q: On the topic of hunter ammunition, currently, it becomes quite expensive for hunters to purchase Mammoth Cutters and Saronite Razorheads, especially given how much many hunters use in a given week. Are there any plans to reduce the cost, by potentially looking into the materials required to craft both types of ammunition?<br />
<br />
A: The problem with upgrading hunter ammo currently is how we work the progression. We don&#8217;t want to drop ammo on bosses for what I hope are obvious reasons so long as they are consumed. We need to have ammo improve as other gear improves, however, or the hunter overall starts to fall behind. Therefore there has to be some barrier that stops freshly leveled hunters from getting the best ammo while letting cutting-edge hunters procure it. In Burning Crusade, we handled this through a reputation grind, but it still wasn&#8217;t a very satisfying answer. In Wrath of the Lich King, we went with Engineer-crafted ammo and more recently changed the way ranged weapons scaled so that they would keep improving even if the ammo did not.<br />
<br />
For 3.2 we lowered the cost of the ammo quite a bit -- only 4 gold for a stack to manufacture. If you were paying 50 gold a night, that should drop to say 16 gold a night. Long-term this won&#8217;t be a problem because arrows won&#8217;t be consumed.<br />
<br />
Why not just make hunter Ammo like it was in Diablo 2 (with javs, arrows, bolts, etc.)? Make an epic or blue quality stack that drops off dungeon/raid bosses and that you can repair at a cost that scales with item quality. Hunters carry one stack and repair it just like the rest of their gear. You would have to make them stack in very large quantities and repair often but it wouldn't have to be uber expensive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But pretty much, this Q&amp;A was terrible. And I don't want to think about hunters getting mana swapped with some other thing... energy? Rage? Hunter magic power? Theres no need to swap out our attack rescource with something - honestly, just sort out the MM mana problem. (And to you people who just say &quot;theres a problem with your raid if you go oom&quot;, some people don't have the utter luxury of perfectly formed raids, and do more 10 mans instead, where the ultimate group set up isn't possible...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Master Marksman needs to add &quot;In addition, you have a 20/40/60/80/100% chance to gain 2% of your base mana every time Piercing Shots does periodic damage.&quot; just like the new change to Empowered Fire for Fire Mages. Voila, we have our own self-powered JoW that keeps us afloat and out of Viper on bosses without mana bars.<br />
<br />
Or hell, they could let us Viper Sting mobs without mana bars, that would do a world of good.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Governator</div><div class="date">2009-07-25, 09:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The prospects of how these changes could affect PvP intrigue me. Particularly, the ammunition changes seem they could add a distinctive edge vs. certain classes. Personally, I'd like to see a mage-esque effect on a particular type of ammunition (say Frost Arrows or Bullets) that has a chance to proc a minor slow on the target. This would give us more time in PvP to deal significant damage to an approaching melee, without guaranteeing we could kite melee indefinitely like some other changes might cause.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think the nerf to Frost Trap not working on targets immune to slows/snares was a bit unfair on Blizzard's part, given the nature of traps (i.e. the target has to walk over it). I think either reverting this back to the old mechanic or implementing a new mechanic with similar results would go a long way to giving hunters a bit more survivability against melee (which, to be honest, is the most difficult thing to deal with in PvP). This would be both through still allowing us a means to kite once the immunity effect wears off, and allowing us to apply enough pressure to melee to make them play more defensively. Or perhaps even allow us an upper-tier talent that reduces stun durations on the hunter, since this is typically when a hunter gets clobbered.<br />
<br />
I can see where some people want pets to be able to spec into any tree or an identical ability available to all pets, but I can also see where from a design standpoint, that this would kill the uniqueness of pet families. I'm not sure what a great solution to this would be. The same is true for implementing a system for the ammunition that mirrors rogue poisons. Blizzard doesn't want us to be rogues with a bow/gun.<br />
<br />
I also can agree that MM desperately needs something to improve its mana efficiency, or at least reduce its reliance on target debuffs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">[iTG] Owlcapwn</div><div class="date">2009-07-26, 06:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">perhaps even a single punishing attack on a cooldown before the hunter Disengaged or whatever. This would be one of those things that helped hunters feel more different than actual magic casters, and might make them care about melee weapons as more than stat sticks. Additional feedback from the community on this sort of thing would be appreciated.<br />
<br />
maybe like an additional buff we get, that stacks, for every time we ranged crit, a 2%-5% buff stacks on us for chance that a raptor strike has to crit, then have another ability that procs after a successful raptor strike crit to do some nice melee dmg (w/ a stun / or an effect which complies to a poison currently on target, similar to chimera shot) of some sort that has a justified CD on it before disengaging.<br />
<br />
that would make me not be as afraid to run up to a warrior/rogue once in a while.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moonwulf</div><div class="date">2009-07-27, 02:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am always around the top dps in raids as a hunter, I think they need to change some things to make some things make more sense, and some things just do more damage (Serpent Sting?), but overall I am not dissatisfied with Hunters in PvE. Only thing I would really like added is some talent that converts attack power to spell power, so your serpent sting/black arrow/magical shots actually get more of a buff, as well as pets not dying 5 seconds into every boss fight that has aoe damage.<br />
<br />
In Battlegrounds, Hunters are amazing because there is so much open space and their ranged abilities make them about the best BG class. However, in arena, it is a complete joke to be a Hunter. In 2v2 especially, it is virtually impossible as a hunter to get very far. Seems like most classes have slows and most teams are melee + healer. If a hunter is slowed and the other team's healer runs away the entire fight and uses LOS tricks so that you can never hit them, as well as the fact that you can't shoot the melee because they are too close makes it just completey frustrating. Melee dps can run around pillars all day chasing healers and keep hitting them, while hunters, having to keep a certain range can sometimes never even get a shot off on people running arround pillars. And don't even get me started on the dalaran sewers map, let's play hide behind the boxes all day while the hunter can't shoot you because they are either LOS or too close to the person hiding behind them.<br />
<br />
&quot;Moving feeling like a penalty&quot; makes sense ... if it was consistant. Melee players can run around all day and keep hitting you and it is not a penalty to them. I just don't really get it. So either give hunters the ability to shoot and move at the same time, or give them worth while melee abilities that can actually help. Something that could really help balance things out as well would be some type of knockback ability, somewhat like a boomkin's typhoon. Hunters are ranged, so when people are too close it is bad .... so give them an ability to force the opponent backwards so you can actually shoot them. Disengage is a great ability in pvp, but honestly is not even close to enough. You give melee dps abilities like death grip and a whole bunch of slowing effects so they can keep swinging at you, but you give hunters nothing so that they can consistantly keep shooting people. Hunters just need some upgrades to be balanced in arena.<br />
<br />
Sorry, one more little annoyance. Hunters have so many abilities to deal with Rogues in PvP, yet almost none of them work very well at all. Hunter's Mark is good, but they can get right out of it by cloaking or vanishing or whatever they do, so it is basically useless against the one thing it is supposed to be used for. Flare is ok ... if a rogue walks right on top of it while it is there for its 20 seconds, otherwise they will sap you from out of its range. Track Hidden? Wow that works doesn't it.<br />
<br />
All I ask for is balance and abilities that do what they are supposed to do.</div></div><hr />

When you try to balance PVE and PVP it's never going to work very well. You take take from bob and give to bill kinda thing. Apples and oranges.

None of them I have seen so far were blueprints for classes, they all seemed to be &quot;Here are some issues we noticed people complain about a lot&quot;. Ghostcrawler is one guy with probably a good size group of guys/gals working under him. He is the face of blame, he takes a lot of flak. I don't think its fair to say that he hates hunters or doesnt understand the problems. He's the messenger and most people I've seen so far want to be Leonidas. <br />
Ive been reading the countless posts so far and Ive noticed a few trends in peoples comments other than the trash talk. <br />
-Hunters shouldn't be rogues, they shouldn't use energy..etc<br />
-Hunters should be rogues, they should have poison, and better mobility<br />
-I agree with both...Mana is fine, I play SV, I don't seem to have to many issues. I'm sure MM and BM do go OOM a little more, I will have to try them and find out maybe the mana regen talents need a buff cause I know all 3 trees have them, maybe volly shouldn't cost a ton. <br />
-I like the idea of hunter poison it's...huntery. <br />
-Aspect not dazing you would be nice but probably OP since you can leave it on and go to town on people. <br />
-I think the signature shots are nice but i feel like they tie you too much into a tree how good is SV without explosive shot, I think its about 1/3 of my damage in raids. Whats marks without Chimaera. That trend doesnt flow into BM, or it does but not nearly to the same extent. <br />
-I like the idea of a spirit wolf like ability for BM it seems like that could integrate nicely but not be reliant on your pet, because if your pet dies you just loss 1/2 your dps.<br />
-I would like to see pet talents simplified. One tree with a lot of choices instead of 3 seperate pet classes. The theme as been simplify and unify. Pet uniqueness is disappearing all pets are becoming equal but some are being left behind. I think it would be fun to see all hunters using a variety of pets without gimping their dps. So make all pets basically the same. One big tree lots of talents, choose wisely. Then the cookie cutter pet game dissappears and everyone has a pet then WANT not one they have to have.<br />
I think the class is decent, I think a lot of people bring there personal faults to the forums to complain out things that they probably have a lot more personal control of than they realize. I think its better to look back and see where we have come from, survival as a melee spec WTF</div></div><hr />
