you mean like frostwyrm with blindfold? or recolored proto drake? or flying dvd, similar to pandaria one? there are couple of unique ones, but the rest are lame/boring, too</div></div><hr />

Not only that, but for example for Warlocks it doesn't really look spec spefic, all of them could fit more specs, Demonology really has both green and purple stuff for example. It would suck if they'd say, you're Affli you're red, because affli is red (it's not). Though, it would also be strange if everyone had 3 mounts in the Collection.

Yeah - I agree, those old style legendary handouts were a bit lame - where you just turned up to raid, rolled high on the 'who gets the thing' roll and let the raid/guild get you a legendary.<br />

Much better when they changed to personal effort to get them in MoP and WoD.<br />

owl in legends are both <br />
gaurdians of the living, keeping them safe from the darkness<br />

I think the comments (justifiably) are about the aesthetics not the lore. Yes it is a demon, but is a horse demon<br />
<br />
Of all the countless demons out there - why couldn't the 7.2 bring in a bulbous mother demon mount or something that well - looks demonic.<br />

Same with the mage mounts, it just seems like a lack of imagination - I mean the models are really well done, but they are really well done rubbish.</div></div><hr />

That said, mages really drew the short one here. Holy fuck, that mount is absolutely horrible and doesn't even really seem that much like a mage mount. The tailoring carpet or the cash shop manasaber are much more of a mage mount than that plain, boring disc. Not to mention that an almost 1:1 copy (except it looks slightly better) already exists in game since pandaria. You take out the fire/frost/arcane thingies, glue it back together and it's the same thing.<br />
<br />
Also, why do warlocks, DKs, druids and palas get their own mounts as well? Druids don't even need to use 'em and the other three already have 'em. All the other classes were excluded from the special class mount club for almost 13 years but now everyone gets 'em? It just doesn't sit right with me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, but it would completely change the skin you put on it. model is skeleton + texture. You have to develop a texture with a skeleton in mind, and a large portion of the work is already done for you if you're using the same skeleton multiple times. It's still dull, it's still lazy and it doesn't do much to make the world feel more dynamic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no<br />
<br />
Skeleton is the general shape of the body, posture and movement<br />
a skeleton in a 6 foot man very muscular could also be a skeleton of a 6 foot man who was very fat<br />
<br />
and no a majority of the work is not allready done for you...<br />
<br />
because there is 2 differant people doing the work<br />
one person spends along time making the skeleton ,the animations, etc<br />
<br />
the other does the art and works on the 3d model around the skeleton<br />
<br />
using the same skeleton is not &quot;a majoity of the work done and its lazy&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
is making stuff in bulk lazy because its easier and more efficeint then doing stuff in small gardens tended by one person all day instead of massive fields</div></div><hr />

Okay so you're literally telling me it takes half as many people to do this.<br />

<br />
so if i ripped off the skin on the left, and replaced it with a differant sin (without changing the flesh or shape of the body under the skin) it would completly change the model?<br />
<br />
The reason for the whole remodel = reskin debacle is the fact that in games, different looks for characters (which often require remodeling, partial or entirely) are called skins.<br />
<br />
But in technical, 3D work and application terms, the Proto-Drake to Firehawk is a remodel, and these mounts are remodels, too.<br />
<br />
The texture maps and polys are mostly or entirely different or altered. A similar shape might be there because of the body posture dictated by the skeleton or rig, but it's a new model and a new texture.<br />
<br />
And no, making ten different skeleton for different horse mounts just to satisfy someone who thinks it's lazy not to, is not, and will never be a wise or good decision. It's a great waste of time, in fact.<br />
<br />
In fact, what they've been doing so far in Legion is pretty smart: reuse of certain skeletons, but alterations in animations, additions of extra animations to set them apart. Time saved and it looks more unique where it needs to be. (see rat and fox mount)</div></div><hr />

Personally I think it looks quite different to, and much cooler than, the Disc of the Red Flying Cloud that some compared it to.<br />
<br />
Shaman was my second favourite though, and clearly in the lead here.<br />
<br />
Death Knight looks great but a bit similar to existing Frostbrood Vanquishers maybe?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, sort of. The skeleton is the invisible bones and joints that are used to drive the animations for the model. It's also called an animation rig, or simply a rig.<br />
<br />
Rigging and animating is probably the most time- and skill-intensive element of the art process, so reusing rigs allows them to dramatically reduce the workload on their artists, which allows them to produce more models.<br />
<br />
<br />
The &quot;mesh&quot; is the actual polygonal wireframe model itself, and the &quot;skin&quot; is the set of texture maps that are wrapped around it to create the surfaces of the model.<br />
<br />
<br />
You absolutely can have a model without a skeleton. You only need to rig models that are animated. Props, weapons, and other inanimate objects don't need them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, yeah. It's not hard to understand.<br />
<br />
Recolor: Same rig, same mesh, recolored skin.<br />
Reskin: Same rig, same mesh, new skin.<br />
Remodel: Same rig, new mesh, new skin.<br />
New model: New rig, new mesh, new skin.<br />
<br />
If you don't use the right terminology in you argument, you're immediately discrediting yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it's absurd to call reusing skeletons lazy. Do you understand how much time and work goes into modeling and animating? Reusing rigs allows their 3D modelers to produce more models.<br />
<br />
Even if they hired more riggers and animators, rigging and animating would still be a bottleneck. Reusing the existing skeletons and rigs let those artists complete more models instead of just sitting around on their hands while the finished models get rigged and animated.<br />
<br />
It's called working smart.</div></div><hr />

I think the best looking are the Mage, Hunter, Rogue, and warlocks even tho I don't really want another horse.<br />

2nd Tier- priest, shaman, druid, monk.<br />

Idk why but it seems like the gold stuff they do ends up looking shittier and more blocky or something than compared to other types.

Yes one might be a horse with some armor and the other might be an owl with a re-used model, but that doesn't make them cool. Is there something I'm missing? <br />
<br />
Note: I picked paladin for my favorite as it really fits that righteous/holy theme that I think is lacking in the ther 3 paladin mounts that are currently available (or any mount for that matter). <br />

Yeah , touché . No argument there. It's just recently , with spell animations and y'know - the Ashbringer, the theme of Ret deffinetly shifted towards swords more. But fuck it , they can leave the hammers , the just need to change something about that horse. I hate how 12-year old charger looks better. They could give it the horns and more armor.<br />
I have nothing against it being a horse , for example the Warlock mount looks gorgeous to me , and done right. Whilst the pally one looks .. Uninspired , unfinished, half-naked and about as wrong as they could've done it :( this is just imho <br />
<br />
As for DH, all they have to do is take all of that ugly ass armor off the mount and throw it in the garbage , and boom - the problem is fixed. Or just give us one of the normal Felbats seen around Illidari camps</div></div><hr />

My guess was that the colors are race coordinated just like every other form. Trolls having usually the brightest colors, worgens having something dark/greyish, night elves something pink/purple/white and taurens somewhat natural colors with shades of brown.<br />

Probably. From the way I read it though once all parts are out you can do all 11 quests in 2 weeks to get to exalted which should make it easier to get on alts. Admittedly I could be wrong though.</div></div><hr />

not everyone pays them<br />
and these mounts are making alot of people happy, just because they are not making you happy, does not mean they are not making lots of others happy.<br />

if they make the game perfect, all the classes are perfectly balanced, the game becomes free, constant free content, no pay to win, the literal perfect game<br />
