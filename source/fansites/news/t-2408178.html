This is probably just some update on the old artifact weapon effect. Possibly keeping Hati around even with a de-powered artifact?<br />
<br />
It would be a HUGE thing to suddenly keep double pet around for BM hunter in BFA, not something they would do at this point in the Beta. Too close to release for fundamental changes.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't talking about as a double Pet. I was moreso meaning as a literal Pet not an Artifact trait.</div></div><hr />

Now hold on a minute, I get turning off the gold bonus, but people will still need Order Hall resources for Legion stuff, unless that's getting a nerf too</div></div><hr />

The only thing they removed if I'm reading that correctly is the Artifact Power token, because, you know.</div></div><hr />

Thanks for posting that. I guess I still don't understand why I will not have to visit the Broken Shore quests. I am going through that section on my first toon right now trying to get my mount. Since they lowered the lvl restriction on the quest - does that mean that you will acquire that quest sooner than you normally would? Like as soon as you finish your class hall quest line? Thanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not sure. They might just get rid of the Broken Shore part all together since it was designed for 110. Might just give you the quest at 100 when you open up your order hall. Have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Animal Companion calls the first pet in your stable and it will obey kill command, but can't use any of the other pet abilities. Not the same as Hati.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the time scale for the release of the full expansion. We all sorta know the expansion pre-patch is out next week the soonest. Cause it wasn't released today :p Or the week after the latest. They have never released a pre-patch with less than 4 weeks.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
if its flagged for release we will most likely see it out on the 10th we just have to wait for confirmation.<br />
<br />
Most likely. But where is the one week notice for pvp ending ? We will have it the 17th guaranteed tho. Never had a pre.patch shorter than 4 weeks</div></div><hr />

So you basically just do the mount part of the quest?<br />
<br />
THANK GOD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can't confirm that 100%, but that's what it looks like. Makes sense as doing the Marks of Sentinax alone would have suuucked.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scroolooseuk</div><div class="date">2018-07-04, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;One of the purposes these tests is to check for bottleneck issues where many players are competing for the same resources.&quot;<br />
<br />
So if this is going to be similar to the legion invasion launch event, by the sound of the above statement it sounds as if azerite is going to pop up at different locations in the old world and horde and alliance are going to battle it out to get it, similar to seething shore. PVP launch event maybe? Sounds interesting. I remember a dev saying in an interview a few weeks back &quot;We have some more launch events coming soon, something we have never tried before&quot;. I guess we will find out tomorrow :D</div></div><hr />
