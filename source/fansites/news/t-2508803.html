Own a Piece of World of Warcraft History and Help Support Pencils of Promise<br />
It’s been a truly epic 15 years of World of Warcraft—and what better way to commemorate this momentous event than to purchase a piece of WoW history, all while benefitting a great cause.<br />
<br />
We’ve preserved a number of retired HP server blades that once hosted World of Warcraft realms, and you can purchase one Friday, September 13 at 19:00 CEST and Wednesday, September 18 at 02:00 CEST on the Blizzard Gear Store to support Pencils of Promise (https://pencilsofpromise.org/), a global education organization creating schools, programs, and global communities around the common goal of education for all. For a limited time, a small number of these special anniversary server blades will be available for purchase and 100% of the sale price of each blade less shipping and handling will be donated to Pencils of Promise. *<br />

A: Pencils of Promise will receive 100% of the sale price, less any manufacturing and freight to warehouse costs, chargebacks, refunds, and Value Added Taxes (VAT).<br />
<br />
Q: What is a server blade?<br />
A: World of Warcraft realms are hosted on HP BladeSystem, which combines server, storage, network, power, and management capabilities into an integrated system. These blades were part of the hardware that provided the processing power to run the game from 2010-2016.<br />
<br />
Q. Will I be able to purchase a specific server blade?<br />
A. Due to advancements in the technology behind World of Warcraft and the ability to host many realms on one blade, there’s no way to guarantee purchasers will receive a server blade that previously hosted a specific realm they were interested in.<br />
<br />
Q: What does the server blade come with?<br />
A:Each blade server comes with a decorated plexi-glass cover and a World of Warcraft 15th Anniversary plaque.<br />
<br />
Q: Is the server blade functional?<br />
A:The server blade is not functional and contains no data. This retired HP server blade is intended only to be a unique collector’s item and not a piece of functioning hardware.<br />
<br />
Q: Do I have to pay for shipping?<br />
A: Yes, purchasers will have to pay for shipping. All shipments will be made from the United States.<br />
<br />
Q: When will I receive my World of Warcraft server blade if I purchase one?<br />
A: Barring unanticipated circumstances, the expected delivery time for items is 12–15 weeks after the final payment is received and acknowledged.<br />
<br />
Q: How will my World of Warcraft server blade be shipped?<br />
A:Your World of Warcraft server blade will ship in custom 15th anniversary packaging and a brown box with foam padding to help protect it during shipping.<br />
<br />

Because they are probably outdated and there is no business needing the actual hardware. Might as well give them away and look good while doing it &quot;for dem kids&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah i'm a bit confused, the wording seems to imply fixed price, but the lack of a price seems to imply auction?<br />
<br />
i think they sold some server blades a couple years ago too though, so probably similar to that.<br />
<br />
edit: yeah, seems last time they did this was 2012, where it was an auction starting at $100.<br />
https://kotaku.com/blizzard-selling-world-of-warcraft-server-blades-for-a-5879808<br />
<br />
fun detail: in 2012 you could buy server specific blades, e.g. the one you played on. nothing like that on this list cause i guess it all went into sharding/crossrealm since then :P</div></div><hr />

1. non funcitonal because its wiped, everything is factory reset, im sure you could get it working if you knew how, but blizzard has likely wiped every single bit of data on this thing, bassicly bricking it, you could liekly get it to work by opening it up and setting everything up, but it would work nothing like what blizzard had it running as, they do this liekly so people cant replicate their programs or steal customization settings they use for some objects</div></div><hr />

Factory reset does not mean bricking. You can factory reset a phone and it is still fully functional. There is no reason to give out false information or use the wrong terms. If you don't know something just say so instead of making things up.</div></div><hr />

When you have a computer, that has all the drivers, the software, everything needed to oprate, and you just wipe EVERYTHING off EVERY BIT OF HARDWARE, that computer will cease to work until you get everything working together again. as it no longer has the drivers or means to communicate the way it needs to with other objects.</div></div><hr />

I think you're misunderstanding what this hardware is.<br />
<br />
This is not a 'computer' as you normally interpret it. You can't just pick it up and install an OS on it and have it run. It's an HP Blade Server node, that plugs into a blade rack that acts as one of many nodes running their software. WoW Servers are not like... A hefty computer that runs an OS, and the game server. That's not how it works.<br />
<br />
I would say its 'non-functional' in that it doesn't have all the components present to make it function. It's like having a picture of a car, and saying you're selling the engine, and noting that it's not a functional vehicle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is not a factory reset. Factory reset is putting it back to the state it was in when it left the factory. I am not taking issue with you saying they wiped the drive clean. I took issue with you calling it a factory reset to brick the blade. You used a mish mash of terms. You can't just say whatever you want to sound smart. Words have meanings. Also what you just described is not the same as factory reset or bricking. <br />
<br />
What they did though is bricking. They did something to make it not work. It won't even work if you manage to plug it into a server that would accept it. Hardware can be made to stop functioning in many different ways. Some would be considered &quot;bricking&quot; others would just simply be breaking it on purpose.</div></div><hr />

I mean.. a lot of people do that. I have a shelf for all my game systems. None of them are hooked up, and may not be again. I do have the 'retro/classic' versions as well. That's.. sort of what collectors do. It's not about 'functional hardware'</div></div><hr />

Blizzard isn't giving money to the charity, nor do they want to (though they do give a lot to charity).<br />
<br />
Yes, it is purchased through the blizzard store, but that's just an advertising avenue. But this is effectively you giving money to the charity, and get something from Blizzard for it.<br />

If you don’t understand this you’re a lost soul and should stop talking. Ever. To anyone. <br />
People are paying for the “junk”<br />
You agree people are paying for “the junk”<br />
Thus the “junk” has value<br />
Also for-profit companies by definition aren’t in the business to donate, they are in the business to..guess what...make. And. Retain. Profits. Even if they transfer “your money” for something YOU bought from them, it is a donation. Because that money would have still been in YOIR pocket, dimwit. <br />
You don’t really work for a business do you?</div></div><hr />

I also wonder how Blizzard benefits from giving the item for free basically. It's a company, and companies are there to make money. It doesn't even mention that it's a charity project.<br />
<br />
<br />
its a blade server. by definition it cant work on its own. It needs several pieces of hardware that are shared between all the blades of the server like cooling, power supply or network interfaces.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not a 'computer' as you normally interpret it. You can't just pick it up and install an OS on it and have it run. It's an HP Blade Server node, that plugs into a blade rack that acts as one of many nodes running their software. WoW Servers are not like... A hefty computer that runs an OS, and the game server. That's not how it works.<br />
<br />
I would say its 'non-functional' in that it doesn't have all the components present to make it function. It's like having a picture of a car, and saying you're selling the engine, and noting that it's not a functional vehicle.<br />
<br />
Apart from the fact that you indeed have to plug them into a HPE Blade Frame, this is not true at all.<br />
<br />
HPE Blade Servers are each a server on their own. Each of them is installed with an OS and each of them has all the required components. If the picture is representing the actual blades they sell then it even comes equipped with everything to run them.<br />
<br />
The Problem factor for your average user would only be that they would need a HPE Blade Frame to actually be able to plug it in. But if you, for whatever reason, had an actual Frame at home you would likely be able to plug it in and use it. Only Problem would probably be that they thrown away the top cover wich could result in problems with airflow. But nothing that couldn't be replaced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Companies do not give to charity to be charitable. They give to charity as an event to be seen as giving to charity. It's about the PR / goodwill they receive in the process.<br />
<br />
If you really care about the charity, just donate straight up to them. If you want a little something for your trouble and don't mind letting a rich corporation get PR in the process, you have things like this.</div></div><hr />

Probably because no-one important is left at blizzard, what use is some signatures from a bunch of nobodies leeching off the brilliance and creativity of the original devs.<br />

I'm a LITTLE surprised. This is not a standard collectible for an average fan. Its a big piece that will be expensive to buy and expensive to ship and take a lot of room to display. Honestly didnt expect so many people to be interested that it crashed the store.</div></div><hr />

Yea, should be around that mark. It's 24% tax in here, so 340€x24% is about 440 euros. But it's a nice conversational piece in the nerdom, so it's worth it. Plus it goes to charity, so I actually feel like giving back something.</div></div><hr />

I was also not expecting it to be so low and i was also thinking it'd be a lot bigger based on other server dimensions but i guess they really mean &quot;blade&quot;! This will easily fit on my shelf with all my collectors edition boxes so done and done.</div></div><hr />

This is really misleading. Blade infrastructure (HP or otherwise) very commonly (read: more often than not) does not contain storage directly on the blade. Typically you would deploy connected to a SAN of your choosing, or similar architecture. <br />
<br />
Modern blades are usually: RAM, CPU, Networking interfaces, and monitoring equipment (thermostats and the like).<br />
<br />
Yes, these are older and very likely had spots for storage. But to dismiss the poster describing this as not a normal computer is silly.<br />

So how often do you setup a blade environment yourself as an IT director? <br />
<br />
Not trying to be rude or anything but this sounds just like you took something out of a HPE white paper.<br />
<br />
I setup Blade servers regularly for our own infrastructure and i would not dream of putting the OS on a SAN. As blade servers are often used in virtualisation your server would crash if it can't reach the SAN.<br />
<br />
Why else would HPE sell OS sd cards. ESXi even fits on the onboard flash. You would need to be pretty retarded to not install those locally.<br />
<br />
Well either way i didn't say anywhere that those are like a &quot;normal computer&quot;. I simply stated the fact that they do not work like the poster i quoted described. They DO each have an OS. They also each CAN function as an individual Server. And the DO come with all required components.<br />
<br />
How you choose to set them up is up to the Person i question but please do tell me again where i stated that &quot;Blade Servers are normal Computers&quot;</div></div><hr />

They're out of stock now but you were able to buy one until late night CEST on the day they were sold. Also another charge gonna be sold on Tuesday. I bet they have more than 1,000 overall, or at least a number high enough to make it impossible to give them a kind of unique label.</div></div><hr />
