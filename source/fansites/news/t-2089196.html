So in other words, you guys have no actual interest in doing anything about such an obvious problem when you can just go &quot;oops our bad deal with it.&quot; <br />
Thanks for showing the community how much you (don't) care about the quality of your product.<br />
In my mind fixing it now that it's live would be a bad experience for people who have already killed him, or an even worse experience for those that didn't kill J'im while he was up (if they got to kill two bosses in a week).<br />

Raid Testing Schedule - October 13-17<br />
On Thursday, October 13, and Monday, October 17, we will be conducting focused raid tests of Trial of Valor bosses.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires a fixed 20-player group.<br />
<br />

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a PTR environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.</div></div><hr />

How any of what he said is helping improving a product? As the answer point out, you change it and don't allow people that already killed J'im this week to get loot from the new boss, you screw them if the new loot is better for them. You change it and you allow people that already killed J'im this week to get loot from the new boss, you screw everyone else by giving some 2 boss this week. It's obvious, the blue should not have needed to answer that question.<br />
<br />
Having the same boss once is not a big deal, they said they are going to make sure it won't happen again. So yeah, that dude sentence about them doing nothing for this to not happen again is scathing. You have shit hero.</div></div><hr />

If we saw them too frequently, we should say something because it wasn't intended. We have 11 world bosses and now have the same one twice in a row. That's a duplicate and thus isn't intended by Blizzard's own statement during beta. So players have a right to complain. It's one thing if it was Withered J'im, then Flotsam, then Withered J'im again. That's not the case. It's no different than the NA region being stuck with the same pet off Kosumoth 4 resets in a row.<br />
<br />
I have to wonder if Blizzard pulls this crap on purpose. You'd think they would have put in a similar system to the garrison traders or at least put a forced cooldown on world bosses (and perhaps Kosumoth) to ensure we don't see the same one two weeks in a row.</div></div><hr />

7.1 is shaping up to be nothing except content to tide bored bleeding-edge raiders or help want-to-be-bleeding-edge play catchup. Because these kinds of people don't actually care about playing the game and will just swap to whatever FotM class gets the job done.<br />

After the last World Quest hotfix I've been seeing almost nothing but gold or AP quests even on fresh 110 alts. Why would I waste time doing a WQ that rewards &lt;100 gold, or rewards materials that are far less than the exchanged item? Both Emissary bags and dungeon chests are complete garbage as well and people don't give them a second look.</div></div><hr />

He's a hero because he bitched about something that Blizzard 100% did the best thing they could do? Force a reset of the bosses and allow people to get loot off of both and you screw the people who hadn't killed J'im yet. Force a reset of the bosses and don't allow people to get loot off of both and you screw people who killed J'im and need the new boss.<br />
<br />
Not doing anything and taking measures to ensure it won't happen again in the future is the only option they had where nobody had any valid complaints, but there is always going to be one or two that bitch for the sake of bitching.</div></div><hr />

I don't think crusade is final. 3% damage increase over 35% for quicker Hp generation doesn't make sense to me, unless you can work it into a Mastery build some how.<br />

However if its the 3% plus the original 35% I would hope they buff divine purpose... <br />

For what it's worth, I'm said jackass and I stand by what I said. I could have perhaps been more detailed in the original post but at the end of the day every word I put down I stand by. My problem isn't with the reset. My problem is with their stated position of &quot;we admit it's a problem, but it's too late now *shrug*&quot; which has been their mantra for the entire expansion so far. As I outlined later in that thread, I've dealt with them on numerous issues this xpac, and every single time, both on the forums and in ticketed responses, the answer has always been one of either laziness &quot;we admit you had the problem but we're not going to fix that because it would be too much work to verify what you could have gotten.&quot; or outright hypocrisy. <br />
<br />
I actually like the content of this expansion, a lot. More than I have in the last two, that's for sure, but it's completely soured by the fact that their entire process feels like it's being handled by 20 people each of which have no idea what the other 19 are doing or saying. When not outright incorrect or dismissive their messaging has been inconsistent. They say one and immediately do something different, and it feels like they're using release as a beta test because they were too preoccupied with using beta as an advertising platform to gt it right then. Withered Jim, not a big deal, but the principle it represents, the principle Ornyx (who bless his heart is the living embodiment of an empty gesture) put forth in his response is representative of a severe and infuriating problem with Blizzard's current development doctrine.</div></div><hr />

Also, not sure why the new Kara is getting so much hate. It's far from just a scaled up health/damage recycle. Check it out, the bosses are definitely challenging, the fights are quite different, there are many differences along the way, especially the 2nd half is completely different, and it's way longer than a standard dungeon. It's the nod to the old Kara that it deserved. In terms of difficulty it reminds me of the old Isle of Quel'danas dungeons that were a notch up in difficulty and loot from the other heroics. I think folks rolling into it just thinking it's another 20 minute faceroll dungeon are going to get stomped.</div></div><hr />

They need to put 2 world bosses per week enough of this nonsense they can fix this problem right now like they hotfixed PVP. That they fix. They removed the number of PVP world quests you can do per day. Then when they did a week later before it was announced the sneakily and intentionally reduced the honor you got from those 4 quests in half so instead of 300 you got 150. To force you to do Ashran.

You realise the Archaeology quests are meant to be on a 2 week cycle. Blizzard hasn't hidden that fact.</div></div><hr />

The sad thing is, it echoes the vast majority of the players now. Since I stopped playing and investing in the game (and it's a HUGE weight off the shoulders), it's glaring how..dare I say it...entitled WoW players are. They get more fired up about a broken game mechanic than they do real world issues. &quot;What? Russia is firing nukes at us?

Blizzard said in beta there were so many world quests that we shouldn't see duplicates too often. If we saw them too frequently, we should say something because it wasn't intended. We have 11 world bosses and now have the same one twice in a row. That's a duplicate and thus isn't intended by Blizzard's own statement during beta. So players have a right to complain. It's one thing if it was Withered J'im, then Flotsam, then Withered J'im again. That's not the case. It's no different than the NA region being stuck with the same pet off Kosumoth 4 resets in a row.<br />
<br />
I have to wonder if Blizzard pulls this crap on purpose. You'd think they would have put in a similar system to the garrison traders or at least put a forced cooldown on world bosses (and perhaps Kosumoth) to ensure we don't see the same one two weeks in a row.<br />
<br />
If you feel you have rights to complain, you need to take a close examination of your life, your principles, and your priorities. It's a fucking video game.</div></div><hr />

World bosses work different on the WQ list. They have their own seperate pool to choose from. Being only 11 choices it was inevitable that rolling a dice on which World Boss would be up would eventually give the same twice in a row. It was just the fact that unlucky roll happened in the first few weeks that really made it noticable.<br />
<br />
All they have done to stop it is now when the dice rolls to figure out which WB is up for the week, there will be code to exclude previous weeks choice. Though at the end of the day, people throwing a fucking fit over a World Boss spawn and just acting like juveniles.<br />

You're goddamn right!<br />
<br />
They should thank us that we give them free feedback about their product. There are companies who have to make surveys and public analysis (for a lot of money) to find out why their product sales are decreasing. <br />
<br />
And the end of the day they piss on us, what a joke.... The artists are the only ones at Blizzard who pull their managers' ass out from the mess all the time.</div></div><hr />

They should just bring back inquisition as a talent.<br />
You've misunderstood. It stacks. Just like current Crusade, except that it stacks on using Judgment instead of stacking on spending HoPo.<br />
<br />
The change in this build is that they removed the limit of 15 stacks, or at least they removed it from the tooltip.</div></div><hr />

You aren't entitled to it. Just like you aren't entitled to a response from Devs and they don't have a responsibility to answer every asinine complaint morons like to make.<br />

<br />
A company that pays 0 attention to their buyers opnions will probably fail.<br />
<br />
One iPhone 7 means nothing for Apple, but if they just don't care about their clients, it will be really bad for Apple.<br />
<br />
Also the argument about &quot;it's a game&quot; is also wrong. It's just a game when we are kids, when we grow up, we learn that it's a product and we are customers. We could say that a Galaxy Note 7 is just a damn phone (and one Note 7 means as much money for Samsung as one $15 month fee for Blizzard). But no, it's a product.<br />
<br />
If there is a problem (we're talking about problems, broken stuff, not people crying in foruns about class X or Y beating them in PvP) with the product, the company should give an answer about it when it's reported. At least an ETA about a fix for the problem (if any). Blizzard actually fails a lot about that (plenty of long runing reported problems with the product without a single &quot;known issues&quot; about it) and they can only get out with it because of the lack of true competition.<br />
<br />
$15 per month for a year is actually a good amount by the way.</div></div><hr />

no, but if HBO gave you last week's episode of the show instead of this week one due to a problem on their end, you'd have legitimate cause for complaint (which is what people were complaining about)<br />
<br />
complaints are good, you correct problems with a feedback, and the best feedback is the negative feedback. while a lot of the complaints are trivial and frivolous, they all eventually help blizzard improve their game (if they pay attention to them)</div></div><hr />

Are you currently playing Ret?<br />
<br />
In PvE, our current Crusade already far outstrips the other talents on the row. Not even close, it's a huge margin. This new form of Crusade is worse, and hence much better balanced with the alternative talents. It's just not QUITE as godawful as replacing a 35% boost with a 3% boost would have been :)</div></div><hr />

I go Ret for WQs, I main Holy. I use DP as it's more useful for casual play and nothing stays alive long enough for crusade to get to it's full potential.</div></div><hr />

Of course you do..you don`t know your own rights as consumer? So if you buying a faulty machine you not going to complain? Or if it`s not as it was advertised? Or if the waiter was an asshole with you in the restaurant? Or..and the list is endless...</div></div><hr />
