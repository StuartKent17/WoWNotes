Chaos Orbs in patch 4.3<br />
We have just made the following change in the PTR:<br />
<br />
In 4.3, Chaos Orbs (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52078/chaos-orb/) are no longer soulbound! Everyone will be able to roll on new orbs that drop, and any existing chaos orbs will become tradeable. <br />

Raid AP Bonus giving 20% AP to Melee in Patch 4.3<br />
We actually think this change is the most appropriate way to get there.<br />
<br />
Melee DPS is generally in a good place over the spectrum of the entire game. There are some melee specs that are too high or too low compared to other melee, but overall casters don't eclipse melee in all situations. Casters do too much damage compared to melee in raids however (speaking very broadly – individual encounters can vary significantly, and there are several casters with legendary weapons at this point).<br />
<br />
Rogue and warrior damage, to use two examples, don't need an across-the-board DPS increase in PvP. We didn’t want a solution that just buffs melee DPS all the time. Rather, we want to buff melee DPS when the melee could benefit from stacking raid buffs. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/201348/new-blessing-of-might-ignores-the-problem) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3280531728?page=2#24))<br />
<br />
Can't deposit Unique items in the Void Storage<br />
Unfortunately, preventing the use of unique items in Void Storage is necessary in order to enforce the concept of items being unique. Without this limitation, you would be able to have multiple copies of items that we intend to be unique. Fortunately, we don’t use the “unique” concept much any longer; we use “unique-equipped,” and items with this restriction are allowed in Void Storage.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, we are scouring through a very large number of items in the game to convert most of the items branded &quot;unique&quot; into &quot;unique-equipped&quot;.<br />
<br />
There will still be a few unique items, such as legendaries. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/201354/cant-deposit-unique-items-into-void-storage) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278902699?page=1#5))<br />
<br />
Raid Finder<br />
Raid Finder loot different &quot;appearance&quot;<br />
Does this mean recolored stuff like normal/heroic, or the whole item will be replaced with a new model?<br />
Likely the items will be re-colored, if their appearance differs. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=3#49))<br />
<br />
Raid Finder Lockout<br />
Completing the raid in 'LFR' mode has no affect on my eligibility for loot in normal/heroic raids?<br />
No. Since it doesn't cause you to be locked to the raid, so you'll still be eligible for normal and heroic modes. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=3#59))<br />
<br />
[...] You'll still be eligible for loot in the normal and heroic modes. You can think of the Raid Finder Dragon Soul raid as being distinct from the normal or heroic mode versions. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=4#61))<br />
<br />
Raid Finder while grouped in a Battle.net party?<br />
That's still to be determined, though it's certainly something we'd like to make part of the feature. There are still technical hurdles to leap. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=4#64))<br />
<br />
Raid Leader<br />
Ideally, players who queue as leaders will want to succeed, and will ensure that they have the tools to help their fellow Raid Finder raiders succeed as well. If the raid doesn't make progress, no one gets any rewards, after all. Unlike a normal raid pug though, if one group doesn't work out, you aren't stuck, and you can try again. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=6#119))<br />
<br />
Deserter Debuff<br />
This deserter debuff is likely to be of a significant duration. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=7#128))<br />
<br />
Loot Roll and Lockouts<br />
The system will distribute loot the same way a raid with locks would, without the difficulties often associated with raid locks.<br />
<br />
For a moment, think of the Raid Finder raid much as you would any other pick up raid. In any raid, pug or organized, you only have looting opportunities one time for each boss - once that boss is dead, your chance is over for the week. The same is true in the Raid Finder. The difference with the Raid Finder will be that if your raid falls apart then you won't find yourself stuck and unable to raid again until the following week just because someone else cleared the lock out. Instead, you'll still have the opportunity to receive loot from any boss you haven't already beaten that week.(Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=6#119))<br />
<br />
Loot Roll - Update<br />
As an update, some of you have expressed concerns about how loot rolls will work with regard to class role in the Raid finder.<br />
<br />
I wanted to let you know that we're aware of your concerns on that subject, and we're considering some options to address them. It's unclear at this point whether any of those options will make it into patch 4.3 alongside the Raid Finder though, or whether they're even feasible in the short term. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200837/patch-43-raid-finder) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278810692?page=12#240))<br />
<br />
Inactive Guild Leader Replacement<br />
Inactive Guild Master + Inactive Officers<br />
That would only work if the characters in those ranks were active. If Rank 1 in a guild (the rank right below guild leader) has no active characters within a week of the guild leader being marked as inactive, then then game will open up eligibility to Rank 2. This will continue all the way down to the lowest rank in the guild, if necessary.<br />
<br />
Example: Let's say a guild leader has 5 alts in Rank 1 listed as Officers. No other characters in the guild are in that rank. If the guild leader goes inactive and none of those alts have logged into the game in the past week, then the game will also allow Rank 2 characters to request leadership. If there aren't any active characters in Rank 1 or Rank 2, Rank 3 characters will be eligible. (And so on.) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200976/new-in-43-inactive-guild-leader-replacement) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278811224?page=5#84))<br />
<br />
Character/Account Activity Tracking<br />
Is this if the account has not been active or just the character that is the guild leader?<br />
<br />
It's per character, not per account. While we understand that guild leaders may enjoy leveling alts, we still feel that it's reasonable to ask them to log into their characters at least once per month.<br />
<br />
The duration of inactivity isn't final, though. We'll definitely be considering player feedback and may make adjustments before patch 4.3 releases. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200976/new-in-43-inactive-guild-leader-replacement) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278811224?page=5#84))<br />
<br />
Is there an option to nominate someone preemptively?<br />
This can be achieved by placing that character at the highest rank below guild leader. If you've already done so, but that rank is shared (meaning, it's occupied with characters you don't feel should be guild leader), then you may wish to create a separate, higher rank for the character you'd like to be your successor. This way, he or she will be given the opportunity to adopt guild leadership in your absence first -- provided, of course, that their character has logged in within a week of you being marked as inactive.<br />
<br />
That's simply a suggestion, though, given current functionality. Many elements of this system are not final, so feedback is absolutely appreciated. Thank you for yours! :) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/200976/new-in-43-inactive-guild-leader-replacement) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3278811224?page=7#133))<br />

Divine Plea doesn't grant a charge of Holy Power (Note: Nop, not bad data-mining (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/october/divineplea.jpg))<br />
Just a quick note, Divine Plea does not generate Holy Power (in the absence of the Protection talent, Shield of the Templar). This is either a bug or bad data-mining.<br />
<br />
Please consider this an attempt to set the record straight. We really don't want players to feel like they were nerfed when this change (which was never actually made) was apparently reverted (even though it never existed to begin with).

Doomguard &quot;Nerf&quot; on PTR<br />
In 4.3, we have fixed the bug that caused the Doomguard to benefit too much from mastery. We have buffed Demonology warlocks to compensate. Also note that we have not yet completed our balance adjustments for 4.3 so what you've seen in the patch notes are mostly of a mechanical nature.<br />
<br />
That said, we think balance is in a good place overall, so anyone expecting huge pendulum swings will probably be disappointed.

Yeah.<br />
<br />
Unless 4.3 craftables require chaos orbs this is pretty pointless change at this point. AH will be filled with orbs because everyone only wants to get rid of them. Firelands crafted items can be gotten from 5mans or LFR tool so thats even less potential customers who want to use those orbs.<br />

<br />
Your friend isn't going to be making barely any gold if he tries to sell them within even the first month of the change, because everyone and their mom has that many orbs stored up. On my main toon alone I have 87 and on my other 4 alts who have crafting professions, probably around a total of another 60 or so. That's around 150 orbs from 1 person alone. Think of all the other people who will try to dump them on patch day as well.</div></div><hr />

Oh stfu. Last time i checked leveling any profession that requires orbs isnt &quot;free&quot;. You either put int he time to farm the mats to level it, or you pay cash and power level it. Furthermore you have to take your TIME to run heroics grind after grind and win the roll on them in the first place. Crafters invested the time and money to level those professions, therefore they are entitled to the orbs. Having said that blizzard should have made them non soulbound from the get go. At this stage they should only be tradeable by crafters themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will not need a crafting profession to roll on the orbs.<br />
<br />
&quot;In 4.3, Chaos Orbs are no longer soulbound! Everyone will be able to roll on new orbs that drop, and any existing chaos orbs will become tradeable.&quot;</div></div><hr />

So this change should have been expected. They wanted them to be BoP at the start so that crafters have an easier time leveling trade skills and aren't relegated to only working for tips. But by the end they want them tradeable so it's easier for people to gear up and see the content before it becomes irrelevant and to try and keep crafted gear obtainable in the future once we've moved on to the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

Really? The ilvl 365 weapons crafted with 5 orbs? I can't stock orbs fast enough. I sell them at 350g/per every time I get 5 in-stock and I still have a wait list that's almost 10 people deep. I've probably made 400-450k gold off of the orbs alone.</div></div><hr />

They spent the time and money levelling up their profession. That's what earned them the exclusive roll, not what happened in the dungeon. Not like it makes a difference to you, you still have to go to them to get anything made. The only thing it opens up is buying/selling them on the AH.</div></div><hr />

1k for an orb is likely an exaggeration and if you seriously paid that much to use one, it wasn't a very wise move. Nonetheless, &quot;crappy crafters&quot; are the only ones who can make items with them in the first place. Making them BOE just gives noncrafters the option to need on them over crafters, only to sell in the AH.</div></div><hr />

Not true. People are lazy and rich. You can easily buy mats off AH, craft an epic and put it on AH for 125% price of mats and it will still sell.

I recall being very dissatisfied with non-crafters being able to roll on them when I was trying to make my titansteel mace.<br />
<br />
With all due respect, but I think non crafters should have equal rights on the orbs, and right from the start as well.<br />
<br />
And because of the following 2 reasons: <br />
<br />
1. they ran the instance as well to reach the end boss that drops the orb.<br />
2. they might be in need of gear that a crafter can craft, and for which orbs are needed.<br />
<br />
For example: <br />
<br />
I am a jewelcrafter/alchemist, 2 professions which for some odd reason don't need orbs.(never understood why they didn't add orb recipes for rings or necklaces to jewelcrafting)<br />
I am also a rogue, and I want someone to make the leather belt made by leatherworkers.<br />
<br />
In the beginning, when the orbs were soulbound, I had to either count on the goodwill of a guildie, or pay freaking exorbitant prices to have that belt made, although I could provide all the mats with exception of those orbs.<br />
Paying 500-1k gold for an item that the person next to you could loot, but you could not because of that restriction, is very annoying too.<br />
<br />
I can understand the reasoning behind it being BoP though. It is meant as a push in the back for people that do have that crafting profession, especially at the start of an expansion.<br />
<br />
But I am still all in favor for BoE orbs, from now until the end of time.</div></div><hr />

That's interesting since you can't need on disenchanted materials. The only people capable of needing on items to disenchant are enchanters and this is limited by what armor/weapons their character can actually use. The two situations are hardly similar at all in fact. What I am talking about is that everybody will be needing on the chaos orb to sell through the AH just as they did for frost orbs. Disenchanted materials are different because they count as greed rolls, and won't screw people that actually need the gear.</div></div><hr />

No offense mate, but Alchemy and Jewelcrafting doesn't need Chaos Orbs to make gold. There's always a demand for gems, potions, flasks and transmutations. Crafting professions like Leatherworking, Engineering and Blacksmithing however have a very limited amount of consumables on demand (Leg Armor, Scopes, Belt Buckets) and need an alternative income to be worth leveling.<br />
<br />
With Chaos Orbs as BoE, the price value of crafted weapons and armor will sky rocket down and lose all value. So why does Blizzard choose to do this here and now? Because a new tier of instances is being released, and obviously this time Blizzard has no intend of also adding a new tier of crafted armor or weapons, so they want the lower ilvl crafts to be easier to obtain as they'll become worth less.<br />
<br />
Complaining about having to spend too much gold getting something crafted is just an idiotic point that shows complete lack of understanding for game mechanics: Crafted items are supposed to be a gold sink, and a portion of that gold sink is simply being used as a way for certain professions to profit.<br />
<br />
In the next expansion, orbs will probably be BoP again considering how successful it went this expansion.</div></div><hr />

oh and for dreamcloth - http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/94743/dream-of-destruction/ has no cooldown. so with chaos orbs not BoP anymore, Dreamcloth is no problem anymore aswell. it's now just 40 cloth and 5 orbs per dream cloth. prices will drop rapidly, I expect them at around 100-200g at the end of the first week of 4.3. just like frozen orbs were sold pretty quick for 50-100g after they were made tradeable IIRC.</div></div><hr />

Alchemy indeed doesn’t need orbs, but isn’t it weird that jewelcrafting doesn’t have any epic recipes? Rings and necklaces are gear pieces, just the same as the other gier pieces that BS, LW and tailors make. <br />
With the amount of jewelcrafter on my server, the gemcutting is not that highly profitable anymore, I make tons more money with my alchemy transmutes. I have come to a point where I am considering dropping the jewelcrafting altogether.<br />
Having to grind ages for ore, doing dailies for the recipes, prospect the ores and then get 10-20G for a cut gem is not very funny. It has cost me tons of gold too to level it, in case you would be forgetting that. And that counts for both professions.<br />
<br />
<br />
I see a chaos orb as a raw material, just like leather is for leatherworkers, or metal bars for blacksmiths, and uncut gems for Jewelcrafters. (oh and these uncut gems are not BoP, food for thought maybe)<br />
<br />
Before saying that I am stupid again, please read my previous post again, I have clearly stated that I do understand why it is/was BoP, and I do understand the game mechanics. <br />
I am more than willing to pay a reasonable fee to have an item made to make up for the levellng cost, but these orbs just make me a tad annoyed.</div></div><hr />

interesting view. that being said, what about keeping the &quot;only if you have a profession that makes use out of chaos orbs you can roll on them&quot;-restriction, but make orbs tradeable from the beginning? so only people with a profession can roll on them, so there is no &quot;QQ he rolls on it only for selling it on the AH, he has no profession&quot; at the beginning, and over time, the &quot;supply&quot; for the AH would be still high enough so everyone can get some of them to trade it as any other trade material.</div></div><hr />

<br />
nice idea.<br />
But I think the biggest problem will still continue to exist, namely people charging 1k gold for them.<br />
I have no problem with it being for crafters only, I do have a problem with them charging that much for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New patterns that are coming with 4.3 still have chaos orbs in the material list. That was not the case in wrath, so i predict price to be at around 3 times of a price of Maelstrom Crystals (http://www.wowhead.com/item=52722)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xebtria</div><div class="date">2011-10-04, 11:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">those high price chargers are not the majority, believe me. there will still be enough people who undercut the prices so that there won't be any 1k-per-orb charges anymore. that's for sure.<br />
<br />
oh and it should be restricted to the level of the profession, so you can roll on chaos orbs (which are cataclysm material) when you have at least one profession which can use chaos orbs at at least 425 (which is the required minimum level to obtain the cataclysm skill). you get the idea.<br />
I fear too many alts who just have blacksmithing at 1 to be able to roll at chaos orbs otherwise.<br />
<br />
but again, if something is tradeable and AH-able, then prices drop like a chunk of metal drops in a swimming pool. all the way down to the bottom.<br />

At the end of the day I don't see people wanting to spend lots of money on them considering they are garuanteed drops from heroics and can easily be farmed by a group who is willing to put in the time. You will also have the people who are sitting on multiple stacks right now who will likely flood the AH as soon as this goes live.. So I'd expect the prices to be maybe 50g or less in about 2-4 weeks after the patch hits.<br />
<br />
Also gear will be very accessible in the new patch, you will have a new tier of blue crafted pvp gear (which I am assuming will continue to use the same basic matts that the cata release + bloodthirsty crafted gear used.), the new tier of entry level pvp epics, the drops from the new 5 mans and the LFR gear. Many players who aren't in the progression raiding scene will be finding a cheap/easy way to boost their ilvl up so they can run in LFR + 5 mans, and this could be acheived without even buying a single orb.</div></div><hr />

OH wait they can't make as much money from the orbs them. Same thing imo.<br />
<br />
I would even say the enchanter at least needed to level his profession as the other crafters just finished a heroic, the same as the guy that weren't allowed to roll.<br />

Funny thing people call stuff unfair when they can't benefit from it anymore but find it perfectly fair when they can benefit from it.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much this it was frustrating as hell sitting on like 10 of em as an eng, and yet I still had to drop like 1,000G extra to get the tanking sword made b/c TADA!!! they're soul bound for some fucked up reason. I don't even know why this change went live. As a crafter I had no probs getting orbs in BC or WOTLK why they did this to begin with is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

I personally think that should be implemented in the standard dungeon/roll system as well. It gets rather irritating having people ninja upgrades from people for their &quot;off spec&quot; when you can use the same item for the spec you are currently in the dungeon as.<br />

Thing is, you can run 5 mans multiple times a day with the LFD and have more chances for loot. The Raid is a once a week thing in terms of loot eligibility.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I know that, been playing since vanilla, but even still its an annoyance and I think more people would appreciate it more if they had priority over specific loot rolls in the dungeon based on their current spec rather than being up for grabs for anyone who can use it. Like say for instance your a shammy healer an a healy shield drops and there is also a pally with a healing OS but in the raid as ret or tank and they're like, &quot;Hey, I can use that too for my OS&quot; and *YOINK* there goes the one upgraded you needed to get into the second tier dungeons. That's all I'm saying about it.</div></div><hr />

Umm,on my server the top guild had 2 made a week apart from each other,and that was about a month ago.In all there are 10-15 maybe more that have been made one my server.Seems every day you see one or 2 dragons flying over stormwind.</div></div><hr />

If I remember correctly all orb-types were bop in that expansion and the next content patch they became irrelevant.<br />
<br />
oh and for dreamcloth - http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/94743/dream-of-destruction/ has no cooldown. so with chaos orbs not BoP anymore, Dreamcloth is no problem anymore aswell. it's now just 40 cloth and 5 orbs per dream cloth. prices will drop rapidly, I expect them at around 100-200g at the end of the first week of 4.3. just like frozen orbs were sold pretty quick for 50-100g after they were made tradeable IIRC.<br />
<br />
Because those bop orbs weren't needed anymore after their tier became &quot;old content&quot;. Unlike chaos orbs were used for T11 gear, are used for T12 gear and will be used for T13 gear.<br />
<br />
The only thing I would do diferent would be to keep the ones you alread have it soulbound (or at least BoA, so they could use it on another toon, but never just sell), lol. Just to screw ppl that kept needing on them without a single use for it and now say &quot;oh god, finally will get rid of my XX stacks&quot;.<br />
<br />
You don't want it, you don't need it, you won't craft items with it to sell or for a friend, why need on it? Let others who need it take it. lol.<br />

They did all the work to remove the hybrid specs, so now everyone is correctly labeled as spec 1, 2 or 3. But they don't put it to a good use... lol.<br />
<br />
Just hope they do it for LFR at least... they could even go further into that to prevent ppl needing the same tier token all the time just for fun. They will say that the odds of someone winning the same token more than once are low... but they're still there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The irony here is that if they wanted more folks to raid, or be raid-ready, they should have at least made orbs tradable right from the get go (and keep the need-roll option for crafters if you like).<br />
<br />
What ended up happening was that folks who wanted to have 359's made for them, relied on the crafter to have all the orbs for them to get things done.<br />
<br />
Maybe they'll learn in the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

That's what earned them the exclusive roll, not what happened in the dungeon. Not like it makes a difference to you, you still have to go to them to get anything made. The only thing it opens up is buying/selling them on the AH.<br />
<br />
so the same should apply to enchanters, that see theirs professions being used and abused for the sake of mats being sold on AH....</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bogrim</div><div class="date">2011-10-04, 11:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I see a chaos orb as a raw material, just like leather is for leatherworkers, or metal bars for blacksmiths, and uncut gems for Jewelcrafters. (oh and these uncut gems are not BoP, food for thought maybe)<br />
<br />
Before saying that I am stupid again, please read my previous post again, I have clearly stated that I do understand why it is/was BoP, and I do understand the game mechanics. <br />
I am more than willing to pay a reasonable fee to have an item made to make up for the levellng cost, but these orbs just make me a tad annoyed.<br />
Again you seem to misunderstand how bad an effect making the orbs BoE are. Today we brought up in the guild chat that Orbs were going to be BoE, and several members had between 20-50 Orbs just sitting in the bank because they won them on greed rolls. The moment the patch goes live, thousand of players with similar stacks will post their orbs and the price will rocket down to nothing.<br />
<br />
Your point was that it annoyed you to pay a crafter gold when you could gather the orbs yourself, but the only thing this change manages to accomplish is rob crafters of any profit as the inflation will devalue Chaos Orbs completely - if the goal was to make the items cheaper to acquire, they could have lowered the material costs instead of inflating them. Getting a small gold fee for crafting a single item once in a while is nothing compared to be able to mass produce items in demand, like gems and flasks.<br />
<br />
The only reason this change is acceptable is because we know Blizzard is going to be handing out Fireland ilvl gear with the new faceroll dungeons so the crafted gear will get devalued anyway and there won't be a point to keeping Chaos Orbs unique anymore because there'll be no profit left in crafting anyway.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tyggyr</div><div class="date">2011-10-04, 11:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Excellent change overall.<br />
I have many crafters amongst my alts, but I rarely run heroics any more, and when I do, I typically don't win an orb.<br />
Because of this, I almost never craft for hire, and I suspect that this is the case in general with most crafters (especially for the patterns that require 5 orbs).<br />
<br />
When the Molten Front patterns were new, I was running heroics a fair amount for VP-cap purposes, but I have to say, I still didn't craft for hire even when I had 5 orbs: I crafted for AH, as I could command a good 1000g per orb or higher (ie, when you figured the cost of all of the materials involved in say an Unbreakable Guardian sword - like full AH cost of said materials - I could easily price my wares at 5000g or more higher and sell). Because of this, I didn't have orbs available for craft-for-hire.<br />
<br />
I suspect that very few 378 patterns are crafted because of this issue - how many raiders with the patterns bother to run heroics to get orbs for crafting? And people who do have orbs probably realize that buying a 378 craft pattern for 10,000g will never pay off in tips.</div></div><hr />
