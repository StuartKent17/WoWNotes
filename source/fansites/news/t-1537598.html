Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion<br />
Another question I've seen asked...<br />
<br />
Baseline healer mana regen with no Spirit<br />
0.8%/sec for level 1-90.<br />
Drops by 0.04%/sec per level past 90.<br />
0.4%/sec at level 100.<br />
<br />
Is the radius of lava lash's flame shock spread centered on the shaman or on the target that's being lava lashed with flame shock on it?<br />
Centered on the target that's being Lava Lashed.<br />
<br />
Could you elaborate on this?<br />
<br />
-Say I have 0 stacks of SoB, and am about to begin AoEing. My main target has BP/FF at 20s, while another nearby target has them at 28 seconds. Pestilence, in this case, will take the 28 second DoTs and apply them to everything?<br />
Still a bit murky about how 0 stack SoB works with NP, since on Alpha it starts by spreading at 1 stack/30s and then adds stacks after- is this all intended?<br />
<br />
-Now say I have 2 stacks of SoB- instead of looking for a target with longer diseases, Pestilence will automatically refresh BP/FF on all nearby targets or spread them at full duration. In addition, it will add one stack to existing Necrotic Plague infections OR spread 1 stack/30 second Necrotic Plague to any targets without the disease.<br />
<br />
I was referring to Scent of Blood, the passive, not the stacks. The SoB passive is what says the &quot;your Pestilence refreshes your diseases&quot; effect.<br />
<br />
Vereesa (Verestrasz) has noticed that Pestilence for Unholy/Frost DKs seems to be spreading diseases at current durations instead of spreading them at new durations- is this intended, or a bug? If it's intended, could you elaborate on Pestilence's functionality for both DPS specs- assuming BP/FF and Necrotic Plague?<br />
<br />
Also, will Pestilence behave better with big boss models and adds from now on? Thinking ones like Ragnaros, Al'Akir and Immerseus here.<br />
Yes, intended. That's why I said it *clones* the diseases to the other targets.<br />
<br />
Pestilence hits all units who have any part of their hit box within 10yd of you.<br />
<br />
Related to your multistrike conversation with Collision, Shining Protector is also acting in an anomalous way. It's not really a theorycrafting issue though, so no point in discussing the details here. Bug thread thisaway: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13183868324<br />
<br />
Yep, Shining Protector was bugged, still using the old 2x (X/2)% style. Fixed, for the build after next.<br />
<br />
Does the cloned dot include the current ongoing time-to-tick on the new target?<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
What is the spirit regen formula/scaling at level 100?<br />
It's 0.412207024 Mana per second, per Spirit.<br />
<br />
What's the mana regen rate of arcane mages now that the 90 tier is decoupled from mana?<br />
(1+Haste)*1.8% of base max mana per second.<br />
EDIT: Fixed. Originally said 0.4%, but forgot that Mages have a hidden passive which gives them 4.5x.<br />
<br />
Can multistrike melee hits proc &quot;on melee hit&quot; procs like killing machine and sudden doom?<br />
No. Multistrikes cannot proc other things, unless those other things specifically call out that they proc from Multistrikes.<br />
<br />
How will Blood in the Water (feral execute, rip refresh on FB) work with the panedmic mechanic. Will it grant a longer 130% duration Rip, or will it always reset to the base duration like it does now?<br />
Fixed Blood in the Water and Touch of Chaos to be able to refresh up to 1.3x base duration. That'll be in the build after next.<br />
<br />
Reminder for anyone working on Recount, Skada, etc... Filter out damage done to Prismatic Crystal. The Mage will cast an additional spell that does damage to enemies based on damage they deal to Prismatic Crystal, so if you include both, you'll be double-counting them.<br />
<br />
Please confirm this. My current level 92 fire mage on alpha has 1.8% mana per second, which is almost an order of magnitude higher. My template 90 arcane mage also has much higher mana regen than this quoted number.<br />
<br />
EDIT: 3330 combat regen mp5 according to tooltip on naked template 90 orc arcane mage. Mana pool is 37000, which gives 1.8% mana per second. Is the quoted mana regen implemented yet?<br />
<br />
EDIT2: Fix numbers and here's a screenshot: http://i.imgur.com/Gz5oH0C.jpg<br />
3330 mp5 over 37000 mana pool, 3330/5 = 666, 666/37000 = 1.8%. This does not agree with quoted 0.4% figure.<br />
Whoops. There's a passive that gives them 4.5x Mana regen, but I forgot that it's hidden, you don't see it. Yes, it's 1.8%, not 0.4%. Fixed the post above.<br />
<br />
Thanks. Does this mana regen rate decay from level 90 to 100?<br />
It does not.<br />
<br />
#2 and #3 are currently not working. Sweeping strikes never multistrike, and multistrikes are not added to the ignite.<br />
Yep, I fixed those late last week; check next build.<br />
<br />
What is the mechanical philosophy behind Eminence and Atonement?<br />
It varies. All stats benefit healing, but it's alright if only some stats benefit Atonement/Eminence, or only competitively benefit Atonement/Eminence. But lets keep this thread about theorycrafting, and leave the &quot;why&quot; and philosophy for other threads. Feel free to state what the values of each stat are (based on theorycraft) are to Atonement/Eminence though here, that's good data.<br />
<br />
noticed that if Blood Craze is procced on consecutive autoattacks, it seems to become an ignite? It looked like it was adding the leftover dot into the next 3 ticks. Does that sound right?<br />
Yep.<br />
<br />
<br />

I noticed Resolve isn't meant to affect life% heals,but it affects Empowered Seals--&gt;Insight(which is op anyway at 5%hp/2 secs)<br />
Resolve will actually affect % heals, in most cases. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476271279448662016))<br />
Ok, the thread just said Resolve does not affect percent-based heals (i.e. &quot;heals you for 20% of your life&quot; would be unaffected<br />
Oh, it does say that. I wrote that a bit ago; we're still discussing, and think it's worth trying if it does work on % heals. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476284789037621248))<br />
<br />
Why do tanks need vengeance/resolve? Can't you just get rid of it?<br />
It's so % reduction abilities (ie Shield Block) and flat reduction abilities (ie Shield Barrier) stay competitive with each other. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476298667800801280))<br />
From a healer point of view, it makes them NPC that don't require much attention unless they have no idea what they're doing :/<br />
That's not Resolve; that's the overall defensive power of tanks, which was too strong in Mists, and is coming way down in Warlords. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476307689643835394))<br />

is sunfire + astral showers getting a graphical update to reflect it's aoe effect?<br />
It will not drop a beam on each target, just the center one; it does an impact visual on each other hit target though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476150024368185345))<br />
<br />
Can't post on us forum. What's the shooting stars chance for multiple moonfires? Still: base_chance * sqrt(x)/x ?<br />
No, Shooting Stars is only the most recent Moonfire and Sunfire now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476284009966624770))<br />
Still 2.5% chance to proc? Seems farily low compared to 30% chance on crit live version.<br />
No, 5%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476307292195782656))<br />

is there a way to recalculate, so that mastery procs doesnt count? it would be a shame if snapshot going away bc this<br />
Yeah, we're working on a change to make it snapshot Balance Energy, and then dynamically turn that into Eclipse per tick (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476327535689490432))<br />
<br />
Do you have any plans of capping the amount you can extend MF/SF with Balance of Power like the old Starfire glyph?<br />
You can extend it an infinite number of times, but the debuffs can never have a duration longer than 1.3x their normal duration. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476293018312380416))<br />
These Q's confuse me. Lots of boomkin chatter but I can probably count the # of boomies I've seen in randoms on my fingers. WTH?<br />

carrion swarm &amp; supernova both could be used as an interrupt, yet the former is something you dont want warlocks to have, why?<br />
Supernova is an alternate of Frost Nova; giving up Frost Nova is a big deal. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476183806316007425))<br />
<br />
And on the back end of that, why not for arcane either, shouldn't arcane multis gain dmg from mastery and/or arcane charges?<br />
Arcane's multistrikes do benefit from Mastery and Arcane Charges. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476230372359815169))<br />
<br />
Are frosts frostbolt multistrikes supposed to proc the icicles? If so why do they work for ignite but not frost.<br />
Multistrikes will be create Icicles and Ignites in the build after next. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476230237982707713))<br />
<br />
Could you explain what the Supernova is supposed to do exactly? The knock-up looks tiny and doesn't seem to serve much purpose.<br />
It may be on the weak side still. It's a short CC, but doesn't break on damage like freezes do, always interrupts, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476248878480498689))<br />
Not a bad idea though its going to need a pretty sizable shot in the arm to be useful. Thanks for the reply.<br />
Ah, there's one change coming soon that I don't think has been mentioned yet: Supernova/Ice Nova/Blast Wave all have 2 charges now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476249743614418944))<br />

Should Devouring Plague's duration decrease with Haste? Bonus orb talents and more DPs vs. smaller MF:I window.<br />
No, Haste reduces the period and duration of Devouring Plague. Results in a consistent number of GCDs in each DP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476435327142215680))<br />
I thought haste wasn't going to be reducing dot durations, only moding the period? That not a thing?<br />

Not unless specifically called out as such. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476222406793515008))<br />

<br />
Does that mean 66 ms rating will give two 1% chances to do an additional 30% dmg? And 80 haste rating = 1% haste?<br />

The cap will be 85%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476425109310169089))<br />
so using armor/armor+k_value means we'll see 29650 being the 85% cap?<br />
Armor/(Armor+K), but yeah. And it'd be 29660 with rounding. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476439188997300225))<br />

Ah ok, you seems to be very relaxed. Why are you bringing these Stats in the Game, if you know, these can be &quot;bad&quot; for PvP?<br />
It's a good thing when we add new content and systems to the game, especially in expansions. It keeps the game from getting stale (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476435092085030912))<br />
For sure! But doesent some Speccs sacle more with these stats than other? I think of &quot;bursty&quot; classes, which benefit too much.<br />

GC's Law: In social games, players fear the perception that they are uninformed more than the perception that they play badly.<br />
Sort of an aside, but once I bought a recommended item and my friends busted my balls. That was a bad experience. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/476147848665243648))<br />
We will see win rates increase when we change recommended items.<br />
It contributes to the original point that even though the choice was fine, the social element made it feel bad. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/476149243451686912))<br />
We see high ban rates for champions with low win rates, we assume because the pros are doing it.<br />
This legit confuses the crap out of me. What makes people think the meta is the same at every skill level?<br />

The intent seems to be to encourage stance dancing, instead they may as well just get rid of battle stance like they did berserker. But wait! You can only hamstring in battle!

I know. Warrior is back to the only class who has to ignore it's defenses completely if it wants to offense. That was the intent of the shield wall change: make it so warriors didn't lose their offense in the process of not dying. Now they have to either be defensible, but be the most kitable class in game (no hamstring while battle stance), while also suffering a damage lose. Or go damage, but be the melee with the least amount of survivability.<br />

Rotation is what now? MS, CS? Is there any rotation simpler now? No slams, no heroic strikes (whirlwind is our rage dump), aoe is now just sweeping strikes, no more sudden death procs. Fury, is no better at that. Typically I don't like to say blizz is on the casual bandwagon, but jesus, its hard to question such a statement.<br />

I kinda hope there's something wrong with these notes, even the monk changes are really horrible. MW already lost healing sphere and they still nerf them to the ground baby.<br />

For instance, Sparring for monks is how you make a passive feel a part of your class identity - a nice way to reflect how monks can slap away or avoid enemy weapons. I'm sure the numbers will be tuned, but something was still lost that can't be changed by numbers - and it's unrelated to button bloat, it just got the axe because.</div></div><hr />

Was excited for the execute changes and all the rage we'd get sub 20% but that's gone already. Same with taking away the auto hamstring and now putting it back in as a stand alone ability that requires a specific stance. I just dont get it. The one ability I wish they'd get rid of too is col smash but they sadly love it. I hate it personally. It ruins how fury was meant to be played in raiding.</div></div><hr />

1. All of Mass Spell Reflection, Safeguard, Vigilance and Mocking Banner require Defensive Stance but <br />
Gladiator Stance: You cannot change into or out of this stance during combat. That means Gladiators Stance warriors will need to wait end of combat to change stance and then use one of these spells... Okay...<br />
2. I don't see how warriors generate rage now:<br />
Mortal Strike now costs 30 Rage, Unbridled Wrath has been removed.That means the only way to generate rage is do shout, charge and autoattack target then... Okaay!<br />
3. <br />
Rallying Cry is no longer available to Protection Warriors, and requires Defensive Stance. I need go Defensive stance and then change it back losing 1.5+1.5 sec GCD for only get 15% max health. Okaaaaaaay!!!<br />
<br />
A tank can't cast an ability that is used to protect themselves and the group (which is a tanks roll), but the other 2 Warrior specs can use it, but they have to swap to the Prot warriors primary stance to be able to use the ability? +1<br />

She wasn't anywhere close to being a character I played much this expansion (Warriors are cool, I'm just not too fond of Arms PvE in Mists and I'm too stubborn to change)... this only makes it worse. Unless they make stances only share a GCD with themselves, I don't see this being a well-liked change. But the, what'd be the point in having stance restrictions in the first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What in the flying fuck. No bleeds, battle stance now completely useless for PvP. The intent seems to be to encourage stance dancing, instead they may as well just get rid of battle stance like they did berserker. But wait! You can only hamstring in battle! So you have to choose from one stance that gimp you, or another. Or I suppose just macro them to one button: the exact thing they said they want to avoid.<br />
<br />
Indeed theyre wanting to reduce ability bloating but add in the need for stance dance macros. I'm wanting to play my warrior in WOD going to remain hopefull that they fix it after all its only Alpha!<br />
<br />
But atm I'm not too happy with these changes, especially in the aoe department, they've give Dk's more aoe pressure and removed almost all of ours or added a constraint (ie.. must be in battle stance to sweeping strikes) really not a fan of this.. *fingers crossed* we see some changes.<br />
<br />
Just hope that the nerf to the aoe pays us back in single target i.e harder hitting Collos and Executes more single target burst.</div></div><hr />

I love removal of Thunder Clap from non-prot warriors too. It's an excellent insight at blesign process:<br />
make a real sterling job of breaking what you want to be the baseline AoE ability (Whirlwind)<br />
notice that nobody uses it unless by accident or insufficient knowledge<br />
notice that everyone uses much better abilities instead (Sweepping Strikes + Thunder Clap)<br />
remove the most annoying competition for your pet ability (Thunder Clap)<br />
profit!<br />

<br />
The problem with this philosphy is people without alpha/beta access. We need to know how things are changing, every complaint we make is being brushed off as 'it's alpha' how the fuck do you think things get tested, bad changes get weeded out? Woody Hearne, for example (/gucomics) has alpha access. The guy barely updated his comic in the last two months. I have nothing against the guy, but THAT is a qualified tester? THIS is Blizzard's line of thinking?<br />
<br />
All they are doing is trying to hype things up with 'maybes' and 'you'll know soon™ enough!'s AND IT IS UTTER BULLSHIT. They have successfully pissed off every single class in the game with changes and no rebuttle. It all gets dismissed. What we need is a comprehensive plan that doesn't sound like complete bullshit or a total reversal of what they said weeks/months/years ago. We need ONE voice to say it, not 2-3. They need to do some serious damage controll RIGHT FUCKING NOW, because a lot of subs hinge on this.<br />

So Blizzard said multiple times that Item Squish will not impact soloing but other changes may, thereby leaving backdoor open. Clever Girl.<br />
https://twitter.com/Celestalon/statuses/420366130876674048<br />
Also I read the buff for soloing which is multiplicative and not exponential as with other expansions, and even has a cap. So not confident that soloing will be significantly easier unless maybe very late into the expansion.<br />
<br />
I think he meant that useful soloing abilities were removed, making it harder to solo. Not that mobs will be harder due to the squish. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯</div></div><hr />

They always scramble to put something together for Warriors and the class ends up being unbearable at the start of expansions. Blizzard never did know what to do with Warriors.</div></div><hr />

I swear if all this work is product of some new jackass that feel that all this changes are necessary to somehow reach some kind of pseudo achievement ... this are all complete nonesense ... what made WoW still feel unique compare to other mmo was their skill management ... their use of careful thinking to choose the correct setup to their skill bars or keybindings ... if the future show that this fiasco of skill design will follow up beyond alpha blue-notes ... this is will be too much ... was too much crap with the huge change of the talent system ... just because they were scared other mmos like dragon age or terra or heck even aion had some similitude to the old talent trees ... man I don't want my warrior to stack with two stances or one during pvp ... that will blow ... stance rotation was amazing for me ... now heck even slam is gone ... and with flurry ... what the heck were they thinking ... holding two two handed weapons and no attack speed buff ... next you will want as to expend so much stats over haste to redeem the crap you done ... man this is dissapointing</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly, how the eff are going to do with the levelling class perks come WoD. With Meat Cleaver and Whirlwind gone for Fury, the perk of WW giving 2 stacks of MC instead of 1 needs to be replaced. Rather they just remove Cleave instead, compeletely useless. Haven't used it since Wotlk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they seem intent on redesigning classes so you only need to press 1 button per situation, like single target is only pressing MS, in AoE you only WW, it's like going back to vanilla when you only needed like 1 action bar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that's the design idea, then I quit. I don't want WoW to become Diablo IV, which seems to look like that's the direction its heading.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure 3 months after WoD drops they will wonder where the subs have gone.</div></div><hr />

These changes make me sick, why not just delete our class? For fucks sake.<br />

As a shadow I can just say &quot;Yes, delete those warriors!&quot;. Tired of eternal immunities and being ripped apart by no-skillers.</div></div><hr />

Take a breath and read again ;)<br />
Single-Minded Fury has been removed.<br />
Titan’s Grip has been removed.<br />
BUT<br />
Crazed Berserker now includes the functionality of Single-Minded Fury and Titan’s Grip.<br />
<br />
So, er, restoring Stance Dance with all its ugliness is &quot;ability pruning&quot;.<br />
Seems legit.<br />
<br />
This seems the real problem with these changes...</div></div><hr />
