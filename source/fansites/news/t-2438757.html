Azerite Armor from Emissary Rewards Now Scale to 370<br />
Azerite Armor that is rewarded from emissaries can now scale up to item level 370 after today's maintenance. It seems like you have to have an item level of 370 for the rewards to scale to it, but that threshold hasn't been confirmed. <br />
<br />

Ranked PvP Item Levels<br />
There is one question that I have seen alot that has never been answered. We know the Weekle cache loot is based on the highest rating for the week, even if you fall below that rating you still get it. But what about the random end of match drops? For example: I currently have duelist rank (over 2100 rating), so therfore I get duelist loot (ilvl 370). But what if I drop down below duelist rank, to lets say 1900 rating, and then get a random end of match loot. Does this end of match loot drop duelist loot (370), or will it drop at the rating im currently at(365)?<br />
<br />
An answer on this would be much appreciated since I can't seem to find an answer anywhere, and getting an actual drop is also impossible. Anyone?<br />
Just received an answer back regarding this one.<br />
<br />
The item level of any gear received at the end of the match should scale based on the rating you had when the match began.<br />
<br />
So, for you example, if you entered a match with a duelist level rating, any gear you receive should be at least 370. But if you lose and drop out of the duelist range, any gear you receive at the end of subsequent matches will be of lower item level until you get back into the duelist range.

I think this is another stopgap before they lose more subs. It certainly isn't getting me to come back to the game yet, not enough loot wasn't the main problem for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EDIT: After asking many people in game and seeing the forums it appears you need an inventory or equipped iLvL of 368+ to aquire the 370 cache. So I would suggest not turning in the quest until you increase your iLvL.</div></div><hr />

Why reward 370+ with 370 gear they PROBABLY don't need?<br />
<br />
It's actually those at 350-360 that will get the 370 reward since it scales up to a cap. When I was gearing my alts, if I had 310 ilvl i was presented with 325 loot. Once I got to 320, i was given 330 or 335 loot. When I was closer to 330 I got chance at 340+ loot. Now can people be mythic geared and want to do dailies? Sure. But there should be a limit and 370 is reasonable as that is equiv to normal Uldir gear.</div></div><hr />

I couldn't tell you exactly what the scaling is, just that it seems to go by the highly useful &quot;worse than what you're wearing&quot; strategy. I'm also over 360 and am offered a 355. Based on your ilvl, I'm going to guess you need to actual hit 370+ to get a 370 in that cache.<br />
<br />
I don't really get the big rush to get this change out there if it's still not going to end up providing people with upgrades. I mean, I get that World Quests shouldn't award people with the best loot in the game, but I don't really see the value of a &quot;fix&quot; that still just sends that gear to the scrapper.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the general consensus on wowhead is 367 to get 370, however i AM 367 and it gives me 355. either way, this is NOT an azerite fix. this is literally the worst thing they could have done to &quot;fix&quot; azerite. are they retarded? just put it in the m+ loot table and be done with it! now blizzard has adopted this toxic attitude of &quot;you have to out gear it before you can get gear from it&quot; mentality. so sick of it.<br />
<br />
ive been playing regularly since late vanilla, i even suffered through wod, so im not the kind of person who goes around saying &quot;im going to quit if they do 'x,'&quot; but ive about had it with bfa. i loved this expansion but they have ruined it with island cancer, azerite cancer, total failure at communicating with THREE AND A HALF MILLION PEOPLE, and they have lowered the skill cap so stupidly low that you cant play any aspect of group content anymore without it being a total toxic shit show.</div></div><hr />

Actually, Normal Uldir drops 355 gear. Heroic Drops 370. I'm excited for this change, hopefully it will make it easier to get the traits I want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no. wrong. totally wrong. you got the scaling part right, the way its SUPPOSED to work, but that isnt how its working. at 367 gear im getting 355 emissary. that isnt scaling, that isnt an azerite &quot;fix,&quot; its literally more bullshit being shoved down our throats and we are expected to thank them and ask for more.<br />
<br />
not to mention, emissary azerite is only that garbage gonk outrunner bullshit, its not even using the dungeon azerite loot table, so YOU STILL CANT TARGET azerite in any way and you have to out gear it before you get it. so its an artificial ilvl increase, which only further lowers the skill requirement to complete group content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1., Players who are stucked in lower item level, because wearing 340-355 azerites, still will not get them.<br />
2., Players whe are hight enough, probably not need 370 azerites any more.<br />

All this implies is that you exist in the &quot;Everyone does M+ and heroic Raiding or more&quot; bubble. Not that its easy to gear an alt to 360+.</div></div><hr />

I mean, if you're looking for 370+ ilvl gear you should be doing content that warrants having that level of power, right? If you're not raiding Heroic/Mythic, running keys, or participating in rated PvP, why do you need to be as powerful as those that do?</div></div><hr />

Just because *YOU* may find something easy or trivial doesn't mean the other million of players will. This expansion is horrible, it doesn't take a genius to see what they're trying to do. The game has a severe lack of FUN content to do. Grinding world quests every day for a few hours, island expeditions(LOL), war fronts(come on), you see the problem, right? Outside of raids, which isn't something NEW, it's old content we've been running since vanilla. These days it's all about those item levels and insulting other players to get it.</div></div><hr />

I guess it warrants more context. I have a very active guild and a consistent group to run keys with. It didn't take long to get to that gear level because I could hop into alt raids easily and ran +10 keys earlier than you would be able to with pugs. Sure, if you don't have those things available to you getting to that ilvl on even your main could be difficult. <br />
<br />
Flawed or not, my original statement was operating under the assumption that those serious about progressing alts likely have the support network required to do so.<br />
<br />
So yeah, 367 probably is not easy for your average player to achieve, but it is fairly easy for anyone playing higher level endgame content with a consistent group/guild.</div></div><hr />

if you are using bis 340 over non-bis 370, then you are doing it wrong. the passive boost from static primary stat increases will beat any azerite trait on live servers today. its so hard not to insult people like this when they spew this type of misinformation all over the place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can understand that after the new raid is released, but seems a bit early right now.<br />
<br />
I think it's more aimed towards those who don't do raids to gear up, but M+. If you're a M+ super hardcore player you can have some awesome gear, but Azerite can only be looted from the weekly chest at an extremely low chance.<br />
Tho let's be honest, if you can get to 370 from M+ it means you're really good, so i don't see how getting into a heroic group would be difficult.</div></div><hr />

It's more that a) traits are all over the place and b) if you have a piece with a very good trait and get a higher level piece that also has a good trait (same or just another one), you might not be able to use the new, better piece if your HoA isn't high enough... so you get ani level upgrade that overall isn't an upgrade for you when it drops. <br />
<br />
remember them dropping the ability ti enchant and gem a lot of slots? Remember the reasoning....? It was that you couldn't just equip the new gear but had to jump through some hoops and get it enchanted and gemmed before it was really worth it. Then they do this. <br />

Life lesson, if you don't open your mouth no one will ever know just how dumb you are. Increasing the scaling of azerite pieces from emissary rewards in no way caters to &quot;mythic raiders&quot; it just means instead of it capping at 340 ilvl the way it does now it will scale up to 370 ilvl as your ilvl increases. If you actually want to bash someone, you can complain about the azerite system in general and how abysmal the drop rates are for azerite pieces above 340 ilvl.</div></div><hr />

It'll be another raid tier (or several more resets and lucky wins of 370 from warfronts for example) until the crowd that effectively gear from emissaries and casual content can get anywhere near that kind of Ilevel, thus invalidating (or seeming to) the reason to hot fix it in.<br />
<br />
I mean, I raid every week and I'm at 357 now. Our group is a few bosses into Heroic progression. I've been very fortunate on drops and have 355 Azerite peices, but is it even possible to have an ilevel of 370 without having that level of gear already, unless the player is a mythic raider for example?<br />
<br />
I could see this a little easier if they would loosen it to 360 to trigger it. Either way it feels like a strangely timed choice.<br />
<br />
Edited to say that I've been reading back over some of the other comments that say they were under 370 and still were able to get stuff-- so that's good.</div></div><hr />

The thing is this is a bandaid fix to try and fix a broken system with poor drop rates for EVERYONE. It still sucks. I would have preferred it dropping from mythic + but that doesn’t adress the problem (since it’s everywhere)... this is just a step in the right direction.</div></div><hr />

I don't disagree. It's counter intuitive to have the emissary cache/WQ system scale up rewards for your ilvl+X up until it doesn't. ilvl 370 cache reward bracket should probably start at 365.</div></div><hr />

The issue is that you only have very limited chances to actually get a 370 item for that slot. That's why they made this fix to begin with. You have like 2 drop chances+bonus rolls a week from HC Uldir, maybe more from Mythic if your Azerite pieces there are not locked behind bosses your guild cannot down yet. Aside from that, you have the weekly M+ chest. That's it.<br />
<br />
365 with 3 low level Azerite pieces is semi high geared. Those are people already raiding Heroic (or doing high M+), i.e. doing the content that rewards 370 items. It's not an itemlevel that you reach just with LFR, Warfronts and Worldquests. It is specifically the demographic that this patch should be for.</div></div><hr />

true to a point, however high keys (9+) are difficult if you dont have a very geared group that knows the score.<br />
<br />
Also boss 3 onwards in uldir is difficult on mythic.(first is easy af and the second is cheeseable)<br />
<br />
This has always kind of been the game tho, at least since wod tho. maybe evenn earlier. There was something that was always farmable and with legion and bfa i feel they actually made gearing easier than ever before but people always got something to bitch about<br />
<br />
That is not saying azerite gear isnt a problem but its an easy fix if they would let them have a CHANCE to drop from the end of m+ cache's there would be no issue. but blizz logic what can you do</div></div><hr />

you don't even understand how PvP scaling works do you? not to mention being able to use all traits on a 340 when you can only use 2 (useless) on a 370. if you dont understand shit about the game, how it works, or even how to play it, don't bother coming here trying to coment like you're a smart person, just makes you look like a spoiled animal<br />

ye cool - but what it really means is you will get 370 cache as long as you are in full 370 gear and just missing 1 azerite piece . because if you are full 370 and have 2x 340 pieces no azerite for you . god forbid you have 3 then you are completly screwed<br />

This game is about progressing your gear which is why there's tons of alternative sources of gear other than m+/raiding.<br />
<br />
Those alternatives have been capped (base at least) at 340 so far, though. Let's turn your question around: Why would anyone want to do harder content if you could simply play the Memory game a couple of times and have the same gear at the end?<br />
<br />
You need to realize that gear progression has a maximum. Always. And that maximum so far was limited to 340 for non m+ or raiders, 355 for low m+ and normal raiders, 370 for higher m+ and heroic raiders and 385 for high m+ and mythic raiders. That's the gear progression that an MMO should have: The harder content you play, the better gear you get.<br />
<br />
With titanforging and welfare epics left and right, this has already been eroded heavily which leads to all kinds of frustration across the playerbase. Now giving heroic-level welfare loot will probably inflame this system even more.<br />
<br />
They should just have done a tiered last trait on the azerite pieces that gives multiple instances of +5 ilvl but needs ilvl-specific items to unlock, i.e. an item from normal raids or weekly from at least +4 to unlock it to 355, an item from heroic raids or weekly from at least +8 to unlock it to 370 and an item from mythic raids or weekly from at least +12 to unlock it to 385...</div></div><hr />

Azerite should have been tiered into M+ like it is for raids and rated pvp. 8+ is heroic range, 12+ mythic range or something.</div></div><hr />

Im 367 and still have a 355 piece showing for the azerite emissary, and im pretty sure the azerite gear is only at certain ilvls (325,340,355,370,385). Whats worse is that i have 2 370 azerite pieces and one 355 so its still pretty useless, they only people ive seen get the 370 to pop up in my guild are the people who are 370+ and probably dont need it.

The problem Blizzard faced was that the availability of Azerite gear is shit for higher levels of gear. Many people have the exact same problem as I have: all our gear is high level except the azerite items (which are stuck at 340, a compete mismatch with all my other gear). We need better availability of higher level azerite gear. <br />
<br />
I do stuff in game that awards 370 level gear or higher, I'm interested in a reasonable way (meaning comparable effort to raids or high level M+) to get this level of Azerite gear , the only gear slots I cannot fill by investing more time, because all (I use the term loosely) the methods are limited to basically one attempt per week. <br />
<br />
The 'understand our problem'and promis to 'fix it' and what do we get trivial content that delivers underwhelming 'upgrades'. So you can be a dick and say I don't have the ilevel to get better gear. But that's just a dumb remark. I quite obviosly have the gear to get 370 items, but Blizzard stupidly or maliciously, I don't care which the result is the same, does not provide what is needed. Better availability of azerite gear in 370 level content or higher.<br />
<br />
This does not fix anything for those in the same situation as me, it only helps those now going through the gearing experience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's not true. I had 368 ilvl on my alt and azerite piece offered by emissary was 355 ilvl. Once I hit 370 (had to do some crazy rep grind) azerite from emissary also became 370.<br />
<br />
So, it seems that there are fixed ilvl rewards from emissaries: 340, 355, 370 (don't if it is possible to get 385 from emissary).</div></div><hr />

Both responses from blizzard employees is worded that it &quot;CAN&quot; scale up to 370. So only thing I can conclude from all of this is that it works kind of like world quests how even though you out gear them you still don't always get the max ilvl 330 gear, you still get 320 gear a lot. So I'm guessing that even though you may meet the requirements for the 370 maybe you can still get a 355 if you are not lucky. Honestly at this point it's the only thing that makes sense.</div></div><hr />

I am coming to a conclusion that Blizz is only &quot;upgrading&quot; the lowest ilvl piece you have. So for instance I am say 360 with a &quot;lowest&quot; piece of 340, I open my chest and get a 355. I am taking this as to how they wanted it to work.

i am 365.48 and getting 355 on cache, i have a 370/355/340 azerite pieces, my lowest is a 355 ring on other slots, ill be glad to get a 355 to replace that 340 azerite piece, but we all know that thanks to blizz rng ill get a 355 for that only 370 slot /sigh,.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiri</div><div class="date">2018-10-09, 03:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you get a 365 piece instead, or a 360 piece even, going froma 340 to a 360 piece is still a large upgrade. then the ilvl your at will also raise with this...<br />
<br />
Free loot isnt the aim of this, more accessible azerite gear is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Two things. First, the Azerite gear seems to be following the usual steps, i.e. 340, 355, 370, with no in-betweens from what my guildmates have found. As such, the upgrade is less useful, especially if you are stuck at 355 already in terms of Azerite.<br />
<br />
Besides, it is not like people asked for [Azerite gear from Worldquests], they were asking for [Azerite gear more reliably from other sources]. Blizzard only gave us this fix. The community was not asking for free gear, just for a way to actually farm for Azerite armor. Since this is all we are getting, it really should at least be a useful way to get the pieces, not just 'you can get ilvl appropriate pieces when you already have them'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sitting at 365/366 item level with 370/355/340 azerite armors.<br />
Most of the other gears or 370-380 with 2 only 355, done hc raids, M+ with with World bosses.<br />
<br />
Cache offering 355, not opened it yet.<br />
Waiting for reset and a normal Uldir clear for a possible upgrade on those 2 slots still 355, but chances are too small.<br />
<br />
I think most of the similar geared players will not benefit from this 'Fix', that 355 cache need to be the lowest slot (33% chance) to have any benefit.<br />
<br />
Once players are 370+ could get 370 azerite armors, but most of them not need it anymore, so we still hope some good luck on those low gears with this useless 'hotfix'.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have a huge skill differential between the worst player and the most skilled. Many people are content with doing wq's for upgrading their gear. Many aren't. I raid for the challenge. I like to tackle harder things and I get bored when content is on farm for too long. Loot is just a perk of it.<br />
