<br />
2.2.3 Testing complete<br />
Hurray, no 2.2.4 scheduled. (for the moment)<br />
PTR testing on 2.2.3 is complete. PTR will come back up when the next patch has passed internal testing and is available for public beta testing. Since we do not offer specific date targets for patches or beta tests of patches, we cannot say when that might be.<br />
<br />
At present there is no 2.2.4 planned. A 2.2.4 could come into existence based on feedback from 2.2.3 players, but at present one is not planned and 2.3.0 is next up. Still not saying when.<br />
<br />
Heart of the Wild changes for feral druids<br />
Enjoy your boost druids.<br />
This is indeed true... Heart of the Wild in cat form will be changed from 20% STR to 10% AP.<br />
<br />
In addition there will be changes to Items that granted bonus attack power in Cat, Bear, Dire Bear, and Moonkin forms. These items have been re-evaluated and in almost all cases, the attack power on the item has been increased. This change corrects an issue where feral weapon damage was not keeping up with other classes in its rate of increase.<br />
<br />
Broom mounts aren't one-use only !<br />
They've got a 14 days duration ! And Drysc is right, the Headless Horsemen drops Phat purples (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/headlessloot.jpg). <br />
We do have the broom mounts for Hallow's End this year. Some people got to see them on the PTRs, they're pretty wicked. The tooltip on them is wrong however, they are not one use only, they do have a 14 day duration though.<br />
<br />
I highly recommend checking out the additions when it begins in your nearest &quot;starter&quot; town, the Headless Horseman attacks and ultimate battle with him in Scarlet Monastery graveyard are a lot of fun, easily puggable at 70, and he drops phat purples.<br />
<br />
Disarm and diminishing returns in 2.3<br />
Some people won't be happy about this, but Disarm suffers diminishing returns in PvP in 2.3.(Don't forget that all the disarm immunity effects are changed to 50% disarm duration reduction (non stacking))<br />
We're also making sure that Disarm will suffer diminishing returns in PvP now. I'm sure some warriors will think that's a good thing and some a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Cenarion Expedition flying mount<br />
It will be a 280% speed mount that costs 2000 gold, it will requires the 5000 gold riding skill, and they don't plan to lower the price of the said skill except if they add a new riding skill tier. (and it won't be the case in Wrath of the Lich King)<br />
We are planning to make it a 280% speed mount, so it will require 300 riding skill just like the other epic flying mounts.<br />
<br />
And yes, we have no current plans to lower the cost of 5000 gold to get 300 riding skill before the expansion though this may be revaluated at some point in the future like when a new riding skill tier is implemented.<br />
<br />
Pre-BC Dungeons level changes<br />
Bornakk posted a few details about the order you'll run the dungeons to level your characters in pre-BC dungeons.<br />
If Shadowfang Keep was the only instance that was having the level range adjusted, I could understand this, but with pretty much all of the leveling dungeons in Eastern Kingdoms and Kalimdor having this happen, it works out.<br />
<br />
With the changes in patch 2.3, players won’t have to put off Razorfen Kraul, Blackfathom Deep, The Stockade, or Gnomeregan for later levels as they will be able to go through them throughout their 20s and roll into their 30's where Scarlet Monastery, Razorfen Downs, and Uldaman await to take people into the 40's and so on.<br />
<br />
Don't forget all the hard work from the Steamwheedle Cartel in Dustwallow Marsh which will give a big boost for the level 30 range too!<br />
<br />
Blackrock Depths is getting improved as well. I recommend checking it out the PTRs when they are available for patch 2.3.<br />
<br />
Dustwallow in 2.3<br />
Clarifications about the changes to Dustwallow and the addition of Mudsprocket.<br />
The update on Dustwallow is the main zone being changed but it affects both the Alliance and the Horde. All these extra quests should make it easier to not have to do high level 30/low level 40 quests too soon, so instead you can stack these up and use them to catapult you into your 30s. Dustwallow should allow you to save up some quests and get you through this area, this way you can be a little higher level before starting the level 40 specific quests, so it will help a bit. But it’s also possible you are missing some areas, with the Badlands, STV, Tanaris, Searing Gorge, Swamp of Sorrows, Feralas and The Hinterlands I’ve never had an issue getting through the 40s on any of my characters.<br />
<br />
Engineering flying mount<br />
It will be surprisingly safe, and shouldn't explode in fight.<br />
Well, these particular designs are being focused on safety. I'm pretty sure at least a few Engineers don't want their mount to randomly explode and leave them falling out of the sky and perishing at possibly unreachable locations and we agree with this.<br />
<br />
By meeting the new standard safety regulations that are required in building a personal mount like this, you won't have to worry about these types of issues - but if you want to fall out of the sky, you are welcome to dismount whenever you want I guess, just make sure you have the parachute cloak ready!<br />
<br />
Girls can be evil too<br />
Yup, you'll be able to create female Death Knights.<br />
We have no plans to make limitations based on gender. Female Death Knights will be fighting, casting, and raising the dead just as well as male ones.<br />
<br />
Other websites have news too<br />

There is a WotLK Interview on Eurogamer (http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=84878&amp;page=1) that you might want to read, but it's only a short translation of the interview made by their french site during the GC in August.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Current set items for feral druids are all oriented on huge stats(str,agi) and when i calculate the AP applying the new HotW, every item has decrease of AP(4~7, approximately -4%) except FAP weapons.<br />
<br />
Unless no itemization for feral druids, it's a nerf. F*** bliz<br />
<br />
What really needs to be modified is Predatory Strike right above HotW. It only give 105 AP when lvl70 and never changes. PS was awesome on pre-BC when FAP was much lower than now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
probably because the only new content in the last 8 or so months has been black temple( which was supposed to be included in the burning crusade release) and the daily quests which serve to reduce the time you spend grinding to pay for enchants, repairs and pots</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;It may be a nerf for those druids who have stacked as much strength as possible to the exclusion of other stats, but especially considering that they plan to raise the attack power on items that buff druids' attack power while shapeshifted, having this talent to make them even more powerful seems pretty nice to me. It also makes agility scale even better for cat druids than it did before, and in many cases it enables us to get more bonuses from many buffs and items (such as Blessing of Might, and... rogue gear!).<br />
<br />
For the mathematically inclined amongst you, here is the formula for calculating your new buffed-up attack power from the original poster Vorox (who translated from German): (Current AP - (Strength in cat form - Strength in caster form)*2)*1.1&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Miranger</div><div class="date">2007-10-09, 04:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As previously mentioned in many of the wow forums posts on the druids section this isnt much of a buff. All it does is now gives us a legitimate reason to take rogue gear and rogues cant QQ about it anymore, but it does not buff us one bit. Raising our AP even in extreme stances (roughly 300+) in some calculations that i made still leaves us lacking DpS in many cases when our energy is the vocal point of our dps. Until we get some energy back in our finishers and OOC gives us occasional energy along with free ability we will remain broken kitties.</div></div><hr />

Bah, bullshit.<br />
The failures could happen at the start/mount time only, making visually interresting effects for the passersby, a welcome amount of stress when trying to escape a patrolling elite that's just 5s away from agroing while no risk to have to rez at the cemetery (which would indeed be stupid).</div></div><hr />
