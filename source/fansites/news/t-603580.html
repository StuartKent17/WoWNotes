Armory Updates<br />
The US (http://www.wowarmory.com) Armory has been updated to reflect the additions and changes of Arena Season 3. Here is a rundown of the new content.<br />
New Personal Arena Ratings appear in Character and Team Profiles. A given character can have up to three Personal Arena Ratings at one time – one for each team type. Personal ratings are used as the new basis of eligibility for certain Arena rewards (Season 3 shoulders and weapons), and end-of-season prizes such as special titles.<br />
The full set of Season 3 Arena rewards, consisting of the Vengeful Gladiator armor sets and weapons, are now in the Item Database.<br />
The full set of Vindicator’s honor rewards are now in the Item Database. These epic rewards are purchased with honor points and battleground Marks of Honor.<br />
The special Season 2 titles awarded to the top tier Arena teams should appear in Character Profiles if selected in-game.<br />
Season 2’s Hall of Fame: This archive commemorating the top teams of Season 2 should appear on the Armory soon.<br />
<br />

WoW translated in Russian soon ?<br />
Nothing is official yet, but the announcement is probably close. A few weeks ago Blizzard started posting offers for jobs of russian localization on their European Job Application site (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/). For the moment the jobs available are :<br />
Localization/QA Lead, Russian (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/loc-russianloclead.shtml)<br />
QA/Game Tester, Russian (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/loc-russiangametester.shtml)<br />
Translator, Russian (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/loc-russiantranslator.shtml)<br />
Community Representative, Russian (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/com-russiancomrepresentative.shtml)<br />
Lead Game Master, Russian (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/cs-russianleadgamemaster.shtml)<br />
Customer and Billing Support, Russian (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/cs-russianbillingsupport.shtml)<br />
Customer and Technical Support, Russian (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/cs-russiantechsupport.shtml)<br />
Web Editorialist, Russian (http://www.blizzard.co.uk/jobs/web-russianeditorialist.shtml)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This definitely look like a full ingame / out of game team is getting ready. Of course there are a lot more languages on the teaser page (http://teaser.wow-europe.com/index_ru.html) than the ones currently available in game (danish, italian, swedish, etc ...) but this is the only one getting a dev team. <br />

<br />
Again, nothing is official yet but if they do plan to launch WoW in Russia it will probably happen soon. (Before the expansion ?)<br />

False, all Spanish people I know who play WoW left English servers when spanish servers came up... But some other spanish friends stayed on french servers (bilingual friends) ;)</div></div><hr />
