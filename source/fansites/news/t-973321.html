Warrior – Colossal Dragonplate<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/september/t13_warrior_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/september/t13_warrior.jpg)<br />
<br />
A simple concept: Let’s make a warrior tier that looks like Deathwing! Gnarled dragon horn and angular elementium plating with burning fire behind it were the key ingredients.<br />
<br />
We build our player armor from a number of base templates, which means the concepts need to conform to predetermined shapes. However, shoulder pads and helmets are uniquely modeled for each set and that gives us great opportunities to create eye-catching silhouettes. In this instance, the sweeping horn shapes ensure a powerfully brutal-looking set for warriors.<br />

<br />
Also makes me wonder what the Mage T13 set will be based off.<br />
<br />
(And I assume the Warlock T13 set will be based off whichever the Twilight Father would wear, if he ends up being a boss in the 4.3 raid.)</div></div><hr />

Sadly, I have to disagree. This color scheme is completely over saturated. Thankfully, this isn't final, but I suspect it will make it to live. Ugh.</div></div><hr />

That's what I was thinking too.<br />

I can't wait to see the other t13. The warrior one looks awesome, I love how it has deathwing's lower jaw. The only thing I don't like is the giant belt. They're so ugly imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep! Tier 2.5 was an odd tier indeed.<br />
<br />
By the way, Tier 7 is the same design as Tier 3, hence why they didn't include it I believe</div></div><hr />

If you already have T3, you know what it looks like. If you don't, you won't be getting it to transmogrify from anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's specifically stated as 2.5. The post specifically says for transmogrification purposes, which means if you don't already have the T3(and therefore already well aware of what it looks like) it won't matter anyway as you won't be using it for a transmogrify source anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you already have T3, you know what it looks like. If you don't, you won't be getting it to transmogrify from anyway.<br />
<br />
T7 is the same as T3 for most classes</div></div><hr />

no, no they did not.<br />
if they did it would be labled tier 3<br />

Its not a recap of the tiers, its a view of the tiers for transmogrification.<br />
tier 3 = unobtainable<br />
want t3? @t7<br />

<br />
OT: I think this is a really cool set. I always saw the warrior tier as the &quot;trademark plate set&quot; mostly because a lot of the offpiece tanking gear takes its model.</div></div><hr />

T3 was from Naxx 40 and can no longer be picked up, it is similar to Dreadnaught (of the same name) from newer versions of Naxxramas, only T3 was 9 piece not 5</div></div><hr />

Also makes me wonder what the Mage T13 set will be based off.<br />
<br />
(And I assume the Warlock T13 set will be based off whichever the Twilight Father would wear, if he ends up being a boss in the 4.3 raid.)<br />
<br />
Twilight Father is a Priest, not a Warlock.</div></div><hr />

Considering the number of posts praising the armor set, I would be inclined to thing that you are wrong, and that people are going to be showing this tier off. And hell, Deathwing's armor does look bad ass, so implementing a version of it as the tier from his raid is fine by me.</div></div><hr />

Not that that's saying much. I'd say it's also one of the better Warrior tier sets overall. Hopefully the other classes will be as good.

I like the shoulders, subtle, yet unique and slick. Best shoulders in a long time, though t12 weren't too bad I'm really not a fan of the t5/10/11 ones. I agree the belt is a bit much, if they're gonna go big, make it into a crotch piece!!<br />

My guess, its no longer obtainable.. so blizz decided not to include it, as people are prolly looking for which set would they like to use, and fairly small portion of people have full t3 anymore, mostly its that they werent playing or cleared it for bank space^^</div></div><hr />

Well, hes not entirely wrong. The shoulders (although slightly modified), chin and neck guard are the same as the human Deathwing model. But I for one, am NOT complaining about it the least bit. Warriors are going to be beasts in T13.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, they just copy and pasted Deathwings armor model... yeah that's how it was done... no work involved. They built an entirely new model with Deathwing as the design, and its about frickin time we actually got a completely new model. This is more work than they've done in AGES model wise, so quite your whining.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i see many talking about &quot;full t6&quot; for transmogrification purpose, many on my server aswell going to swp to get t6...<br />
Probably they're wrath baby or cata ones, t6 used to be 5 items, not 8, the ones in swp were added later, to not loose the sets bonus, and THEIR SKIN ISN'T T6, doesn't fit at all with T6. You gotta pick belt boots still in BT/MH not tier set but they fit with the skin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is my opinion, but I think it looks great. I was completely expecting it to look like Deathwing. I'm a fan of most Warrior tiers. If I was fanboying, though, I would like every single tier but I don't. Tier 9 looked bad, Tier 7 DK is horrendous, the Mail Marshal PvP set is boring and unimaginative, etc.</div></div><hr />

Gnarled dragon horn and angular elementium plating with burning fire behind it It's fairly clear that the red parts are actually going to be animated burning fire / lava textures rather than just this solid red. The effect of the saturation will not be there once it's animated (probably cycling between this red, oranges and yellows)</div></div><hr />

It must have been like this for a while. I was looking at them on wowhead a few weeks ago when they first announced transmorg, and it was messed up on wowhead, I simply thought it was an error on their end, but if it's showing up like that on an official blizzard preview...unless blizzard themselves simply went to wowhead and took screenshots from there, which seems unlikely given the particle effects are showing up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now the black parts of the armor to me look gray and faded out, i would like to see them darker, although they may have just lightened that part up to show better on a black background. Still if thats not the case i think it looks to washed out. <br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/september/t13_warrior.jpg<br />
<br />
The use of red is just a bit to much, I want more color, vibrant color. If its supposed to look like lava then make it look like lava, it has all kinds of colors in it, yellows and oranges and reds. not just red. I think that takes a bit away. So what I would like to see is this, you guys take the image and make it what you will, recolor it as you see fit and lets comment on the recolors. See who can strip it down and come up with the best concept using the model we have.<br />
<br />
http://i1196.photobucket.com/albums/aa418/eyegotwould/gun%20stuff/Tier13WarriorRecolorbyTantilus.jpg<br />
<br />
I dropped the blacks down darker, and layered on some orange and yellow to make the lava well a bit more lava-ish. I also threw in a little gold on the areas i see as a bit more for show.. the metal on the helm and claw shoulders. the belt buckle the bracers/gloves and grieves. <br />

I like the color and detailed cracks, makes sense that it resembles lava. the horns are a nice touch, resembles deathwing. T12 shoulders looked like a molten giant... big deal, what does that have to do with the set. having a molten giant on your shoulders? meh. but T13 looks nice... and they didn't overdo it with hug clown smiley faces on the belt, chest, legs, shoulders, LOL<br />
<br />
I like that it has a semi serious theme, doesn't look like a clown suit. good job.</div></div><hr />

The set looks awesome and it will look awesome on every other race in the game. I'm barely able to not start cursing at you because I really hate people like you :p . If you hate Blizzard so much stop playing the game please :)<br />

Good thing I hate people like you then, so I don't mind. You carry on praising Blizzard for being lazy because 'LOL KOOL DRAGON ARMOUR I LEIKEZ IT ALOT CUZ IT HAS FIRE' Such a shame. Blizzard have really lost it. Not a single Cata tier has been any good yet, and for t13 it stays that way. Nothing is special about any of the tier sets in cata, but that doesn't matter. I'm talking about them slacking. They coulden't even get it right, AND they were copying from another model. The saturation is way too high. It's washed out and there is too much red. Every tier but 2.5 and 9 horde side beat this hands down. TIER 10 ACTUALLY HAD WORK PUT INTO IT. But this is Cata, so they don't even care as much as wotlk.</div></div><hr />

I want to punch you, you(supposing a warrior) get to look like Deathwing as depicted in the original artwork and you still have the nerve to go emo on it...<br />

Because it's your opinion, not everybody elses.. Set looks good - Hopefully not a final version as others have mentioned the coloring could go a few shades darker.. Good things to come with the rest of the sets hopefully.</div></div><hr />

What do you mean boring!? You get to wear Deathwin's Chin as a helmet. And his claws as shoulder guards! If that's not bitchin' then <br />

<br />
Way to put the first tier Warrior Season 9 set on there with the Valorous Dreadnaught shoulders.<br />
<br />
<br />
and I know that the Valorous Dreadnaught set is currently bugged, but you'd think Blizzard would take freaking TEN MINUTES and dig up the proper textures.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, T10 Heroic belt and boots aren't right either. lol blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Ok it's not a bad looking set, not a good looking one either imho but that's just taste.<br />
I don't like the symbolism behind it though.<br />
<br />
Also why is the AQ set shown and not the T3?<br />
<br />
Ah well, a little bit more shine and polish on warrior armor sets would be an interesting change of pace, I think T11,12 and 13 all look far too similar.<br />
Though to be fair, the advantage of similar looking sets allows you to create neat looking mix and matches with transmog, then again, more varied sets with a little creativity could also be blended.</div></div><hr />

Though given that helm token is bound to be looted from him, all guys predicting the wearable chin were proven right.<br />

101% it's gonna be wooden-flowery-birdy crap yet again, herbivore animal crap as a rare change(moose set ftl). A miracle must happen so blizz would finally realise there is like another half of the class that has nothing to do with damn shrubbery and birds - feral combat. Tanking and dps and pvp. WTB at least one feral-themed set for all the 7 years &gt;.&lt; Something that would fit a merciless bloodthirsty predator a feral druid is. The funny thing is how druids usually wear feral-themed armor in comics.</div></div><hr />

Then go state these in the official Blizzard forum, so that they hand it to a class who will be more than happy and likely to wear it(Pointing at DKs) in place of you whiners...<br />

Tone down the reds and it competes with the t6 for me. Very good job there, Blizzard!<br />
