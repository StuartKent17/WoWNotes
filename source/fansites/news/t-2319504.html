The Great Gnomeregan Run<br />
The Great Gnomeregan Run (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/696-the-great-gnomeregan-run) is this weekend, as is the event that inspired it, Running of the Gnomes! <br />
<br />
Running of the Gnomes will benefit the Cleveland Clinic and breast cancer research. The event benefits the Cleveland Clinic (http://ccf.convio.net/site/TR/DIY/CCFTeamRaiser?team_id=6214&amp;pg=team&amp;fr_id=1580) and starts at 7pm EST /4pm PST on Scarlet Crusade-US on October 14th, 2017.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Join The Great Gnomeregan Run–October 14!<br />
Are you a gnome? Do you know a gnome? Would you like to BE a gnome? (And who wouldn’t?) Then rise UP to the challenge of The Great Gnomeregan Run on Saturday, October 14 from Gnomeregan to Booty Bay.<br />
<br />
Where: Beginning outside the gnome starting area and ending in Booty Bay<br />
<br />
Who: Alliance-Only (Don’t worry, Horde can create a level 1 gnome and join in the fun too.)<br />
<br />
Whether you’re a level 1 gnome (highly encouraged), a level 71 human, or a level 110 draenei, you’ll be able to join in this fun run beginning in the gnome starting area, winding through Dun Morogh, Ironforge, the Deeprun Tram, Stormwind, Elwynn Forest, Duskwood, and Stranglethorn Vale where the run culminates in Booty Bay.<br />
<br />

<br />
It's a big big BIG world out there, but don’t worry about getting lost, there will be course markers and spectators along the way to help keep you on track. You’ll even see a few familiar faces among the onlookers!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/october/thumb/gnomeRun02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2017/october/gnomeRun02.jpg) <br />
<br />
Stranglethorn Vale is a dangerous place for low-level characters so you may want to find some muscle to join you along the way for a little extra protection. If you’re a higher-level character, think about playing chaperone for a gnome.<br />
<br />
Whether short or tall, it will be a good time for all. <br />

Recent Actions Against Terms of Use Violations<br />
We’ve recently taken action against a number of accounts that were that were found to be using third-party programs that automate gameplay. These programs (commonly called cheats, bots, or hacks) automate certain aspects of gameplay, or provide unintended advantages and abilities to the player. This type of cheating undermines other players' experience and severely upsets the balance of the game environment.<br />
<br />
As a reminder, in order to ensure fair play and competitive integrity, we closely monitor these and other activities that violate the Terms of Use.<br />
<br />
We’re committed to providing an equal and fair playing field for everyone in World of Warcraft, and will continue to take action against those found in violation of our Terms of Use. Cheating of any form will not be tolerated.<br />

Diversity Meet-Up at BlizzCon<br />
The Blizzard community is global and diverse, and this is something we cherish. We’re proud of how our players and our workforce reflect the spectrum of cultures, genders, sexual orientations, and interests that make up the world we live in—it’s cool we’re not all the same. It helps make life more interesting and rewarding. That’s why we think it’s important to find new ways to recognize who we are as a global community. We know that this is important to many others in the community too. Time and time again, we’re inspired by how our players celebrate and support each other’s differences.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, we’re excited to introduce a new space at BlizzCon this year that we’re calling the Blizzard Diversity Meet-Up.<br />
<br />
The Diversity Meet-Up is for all attendees who are interested to join discussions about diversity in gaming and in life. One of our loftier goals for the space is to make it a place for people to share their experiences as they relate to diversity and inclusivity, whether in our games or within our community. To that end, we’re going to encourage group discussions, and Blizzard employees will be there to share their stories as well. We’re also there to answer any questions attendees may have about how Blizzard is supporting diversity from a workforce and hiring standpoint.<br />
<br />
We see the Blizzard Diversity Meet-Up at BlizzCon as a celebration of our community and another way to enrich how we interact with each other. That’s the inspiration for bringing it to the show. We look forward to seeing you there, hearing your ideas and experiences, sharing our own, and coming together as we do every year to embrace our inner geek and everything else that makes us who we are.<br />

Celebrate WoW Community Creations with The Fine Art of Fan Art (episode #1)<br />
The Fine Art of Fan Art Episode #1 has been released! <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
We have some incredibly gifted artists in the World of Warcraft community. To celebrate a few of the talented players out there, we’re excited to introduce a new video series: The Fine Art of Fan Art.<br />
<br />
Over the years, World of Warcraft fans have demonstrated their passion for all things Azeroth with incredible creations. We’ve been treated to paintings and drawings, sculptures and statues, machinima, cosplay, and so much more. Now we’re taking a closer look at the work that goes into some of these amazing projects.<br />
<br />
In our first episode, we meet Thomas Karlsson—a digital artist from Sweden who brings the magic of Warcraft to life with a flick of his stylus. Check out the video below to learn more about Thomas, discover what inspires him, and follow his process as he creates an epic Varian Wrynn-inspired scene.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for the next installment of The Fine Art of Fan Art, coming soon.<br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Patch 4.0.1 Goes Live<br />
After a long maintenance, patch 4.0.1 released on October 12th of 2010. This new patch brought a number of new systems such as Flexible Raid Lockouts and Reforging to the game, as well as removing and changing stats. Also in this patch Spell Proc Alerts were added for each class. This system gives players a visual cue when an important proc is active.<br />
<br />

<br />
New Druid Animations<br />
After adding a few new Shaman and Warlock animations, Blizzard added new Hurricane and Wrath animations in 2011. Wrath required a second round of changes due to some visual issues, but the new iterations were a big improvement.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Patch 6.0.2 Goes Live<br />
Patch 6.0.2 brought numerous changes to the game, including new character models, the stat squish, stat changes, auction house merge, the Toy Box, reagent bank, and more! Reforging was removed, along with Hit and Expertise. Bonus Armor, Multistrike, and Versatility were some of the new stats added.<br />

This diversity thing is just getting dumber and dumber. Diversity is important, but not in the way many people seem to think.<br />
<br />
Skin color doesn't determine whether or not you're competent at game design. Sexual orientation doesn't determine whether or not you're competent at game design. Gender doesn't determine whether you're competent at game design. Religion doesn't determine whether or not you're competent at game design.<br />
<br />
You want to know what does determine whether or not you're competent at game design? Three things: Education, Professional Experience, and Diversity of Thought. Ideas that differ from that of the collective, that may offer perspective that other people lack. The ability to look at a problem differently from others and propose solutions that are more efficient as a result. Diversity of Thought is not obtained through hiring all walks of life. It is obtained through the evaluation of individuals based on their merits, even going so far as to hire someone you disagree with if only to break up the GroupThink.<br />
<br />
Skin color, sexual orientation, gender and religion doesn't necessarily mean you have that perspective. Being a black person in contemporary society doesn't offer you insight into game development, or any other technical skill for that matter. Being a gay dude doesn't either. Individual experience does. That is why you need to look at the individual merits of the person, and not just run down the diversity checklist. Anyone who thinks that being a minority offers any more perspective than individual accomplishments and experience has an agenda to further.<br />

apparently you don't go outside, or at least outside your echochamber.<br />
<br />
I will give you an example. Ben Shapiro gets called a Nazi, and he's Jewish.<br />

First it was you don't agree with me so you're racist. That didn't end up working for lefties so now its Nazi.</div></div><hr />

For fuck's sake... Look at how diverse and accepting you guys are! Do you want a reward? Pat on the head? A cookie perhaps? <br />

Every sensible person accepts other races, genders and sexual orientations. IT'S NOTHING SPECIAL. STOP MAKING A BIG NUMBER OUT OF IT AND SHOVE YOUR DIVERSITY MEET-UPS UP YOUR ASS.<br />
<br />
Trans people can't serve in the military, LGBTQ people can now get fired based on their sexuality again, other things. I'm not saying we need to vomit rainbows, but when we stop talking about issues, we forget that they were as big a deal as they were in the past (resulting in rape, murder, harassment, defamement, job loss, etc.) and then the issues recur.<br />

You're right. His side is the one where people throw around useless buzzwords for whatever scapegoat boogeyman they're angry at this week (SJWs, millennials, feminists, you name it). My mistake. <br />
<br />
<br />
Diversity is fine, but forcing diversity isn't diversity, it's retarded bullshit.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Diversity Meet-Up is for all attendees who are interested to join discussions about diversity in gaming and in life.<br />
<br />
Forcing how? Nowhere does it say that this meet-up is mandatory for BlizzCon attendees. Personally I'd chalk this thing up to the fact that people are divided like *insert clever simile/metaphor here* these days. Maybe someone does have to provide a 'safe place' to make people feel welcome and try to find some sort of common ground (and with gaming having the reputation it has, that might just be a good thing).<br />
<br />
<br />
I saw people on reddit talking about how it's racist of blizzard to have little to no black people on the wow team, they should hire based on qualifications, not because of fucking diversity.<br />
<br />
And I trust the random people on reddit provided swathes of evidence and inside information of this alleged racism?</div></div><hr />

SJWs and Feminists as much as i hate them are a totally different topic, ignore what the other guy was talking about. A person doesn't need a diversity safe space to be diverse or talk about diversity. The entire point of blizzcon is diversity in the first place, meeting up with blizz fans because of the common enjoyment, not based on skin color/gender etc. My statement still stands, diversity doesn't matter when it comes to qualifications, hiring someone because it would be &quot;diverse' as apposed to someone who is literally better at the job is idiotic. More importantly though it's painfully obvious blizzard is doing this to pander to those people, which isn't a bad thing because $$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$$. Also, those people on reddit are morons, i thought you'd agree with it based on your previous statements but it seems you do not, luckily.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">miffy23</div><div class="date">2017-10-14, 09:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Unpopular opinion incoming! This diversity thing is just getting dumber and dumber. Diversity is important, but not in the way many people seem to think.<br />
<br />
Skin color doesn't determine whether or not you're competent at game design. Sexual orientation doesn't determine whether or not you're competent at game design. Gender doesn't determine whether you're competent at game design. Religion doesn't determine whether or not you're competent at game design.<br />
<br />
You want to know what does determine whether or not you're competent at game design? Three things: Education, Professional Experience, and Diversity of Thought. Ideas that differ from that of the collective, that may offer perspective that other people lack. The ability to look at a problem differently from others and propose solutions that are more efficient as a result. Diversity of Thought is not obtained through hiring all walks of life. It is obtained through the evaluation of individuals based on their merits, even going so far as to hire someone you disagree with if only to break up the GroupThink.<br />
<br />
Skin color, sexual orientation, gender and religion doesn't necessarily mean you have that perspective. Being a black person in contemporary society doesn't offer you insight into game development, or any other technical skill for that matter. Being a gay dude doesn't either. Individual experience does. That is why you need to look at the individual merits of the person, and not just run down the diversity checklist. Anyone who thinks that being a minority offers any more perspective than individual accomplishments and experience has an agenda to further.<br />
<br />
Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go hide in my bunker to weather out the shitstorm I think I've caused.<br />
<br />
These kinds of meet-ups and other activities and projects are not to &quot;forcibly&quot; include minorities into whatever organization is the subject, they are to address and discuss discrimination, sexism, racism etc in those areas. Yes, most adult educated human beings know what you just said - quite a few don't act that way though, and thus your gender, race, sexual orientation or faith is still very often a criterium for how you are treated by others at the workplace, in the education sector, and it affects your chances.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately a lot of sheltered males online don't seem to get that point and instead believe a politically correct &quot;dictatorship&quot; is trying to force minorities on them - whatever that means.</div></div><hr />

No, but encouraging more diverse groups of people to pursue jobs in the games industry means you're activating a bunch of untapped potential and bringing in new ideas and perspectives to create new things.<br />

You are 'murican so I get that it's hard to wrap your head around this but I'll try to help you. People are not worked up about diversity. There's nothing wrong with that. People are simply tired of this constants talk about diversity. Of course it doesn't help that you can't really discuss diversity (voice positive and negative things about it).

Skin color, sexual orientation, gender and religion doesn't necessarily mean you have that perspective. Being a black person in contemporary society doesn't offer you insight into game development, or any other technical skill for that matter. Being a gay dude doesn't either. Individual experience does. That is why you need to look at the individual merits of the person, and not just run down the diversity checklist. Anyone who thinks that being a minority offers any more perspective than individual accomplishments and experience has an agenda to further.<br />

<br />
minorities have known this for a long time. tell that to the white people that dont, or go out of their way to devalue what people think/say just because they're a minority.<br />
<br />
The problem with your &quot;opinion&quot; is that &quot;minorities&quot; expect &quot;whites&quot; to value their input in a Western, i.e. &quot;white&quot; society. Regardless, this type of nonsense doesn't have a place at a gaming convention nor a gaming forum. Now, if you don't mind, I would prefer to see more speculation about the upcoming expansion.<br />

I'm not talking about hiring for diversity, I'm talking about getting more people interested in the field so that more people will pursue relevant education and build strong protfolios so that there's more competition and even more cream to rise to the top.</div></div><hr />

When did posting a comment on MMO-Champion equate to being triggered or commonly lead to a massive public freak-out?<br />

Granted, the diversity meet-up seems silly to me. But my life will continue as it has been. Although, I would like to the ability to disagree with an event without the involvement of calling someone triggered from either side of the fence. It's just a cringe inducing word. <br />

His answer: Did you see the us servers, cesspool, all of them. Politics, hate, spewing disgusting things. I'm paraphrasing, but cesspool was one of his point.<br />
<br />
Not the first time I meet with hatred from there, when I get it in beta, there are always so dense people, it just hurts the experience, and sucks out any joy we have. In WoD beta, we were called eurotrash, just for existing, Asian and Russian players were mocked by them. It is so bad, many of us are trying to avoid talking on chat, or any interaction with US players. There are nice people amongst them, but majority... Never seen such spite from any fellow non-US members. There are bickering, but US level is a new record.<br />
<br />
In Europe generally we see more diversity, not ideal on some fields ofc, but we don't live our life without seeing someone from a different nation, we have that everyday. <br />
<br />
So when a word like &quot;diversity&quot; just appears, they are frigging triggered, holy moly. Of frigging course they will not hire an incompetent dude just for being Asian/Black/Blue/Purple, good gods you are so dense. But they try to have more cultures, more backgrounds, more diverse opinions because it is a frigging creative group, to come out with new ideas, to cater bigger audience than your basement. People play from all around the world, and it doesn't revolve around you. The more the merrier, more viewpoints more ideas to add. Gods forbid they want to unite they team even if they have their differences. Do you know about team building meetings? Or like colleagues going to a trip or a drink and the company pays for it? No? Yeah, we have that here. Same poop on that line. <br />
<br />
Homogeneity is death of creativity, death of inspiration, death of freeing your mind, to look outside of your box and also: death of many nations.<br />
<br />
Lore or game has many cultures in it, it is so diverse, without diversity it would be so bland. Those are coming from variety of cultures and people. Are you triggered by that too?<br />

Man, there's no need to lump me in with &quot;You guys&quot;. I'm here in the middle. I'm no super-powered SJW. I practice equality, but it's not like I'm going around campaigning for causes like this. I'm simply amused that many people on the side you apparently consider yourself on are displaying the same behavior they are mocking the other side with.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't apply to whoever is reading this right now, that's fine and they should just skip it. Skipping things that have no bearing on you is something that's normal. But it can't be denied that the people screeching whenever they read anything to do with perceived social justice, is on the rise. If you are on the anti-SJW side, as you appear to be, and you aren't doing that, then clearly I'm not talking about you?<br />
<br />
Clearly you feel attacked. Your views are your views. I can respect that just fine. I'm not going to hurl insults at you as a person. I didn't single out anyone in this thread to demean them, even if this thread holds several posts I could use to illustrate my point. I am criticizing a behavior on one side, that that side is using as a tool to bash the other side. Like I said, I find amusement in that. I'm a cis-gendered while male. I just find it fun to see people on both sides are just as triggered by these issues these days. If anyone thought my post went too far to drive that point home, I apologise.<br />
<br />
Except if you feel you need to win arguments by trying to devalue your opponents with personal insults. That not how you can have an adult discussion.</div></div><hr />

Hey now, when I went to BlizzCon when Overwatch was announced, I was in line to give feedback and a girl in front of me wrote that there wasn't enough diversity. It was probably shit like that which prompted they do something at BlizzCon to appease them. Now we have gay Tracer without any reason other than to make a gay character that people like. For a team that always says that story is so important, they didn't fucking put any story into that.</div></div><hr />

Skin color doesn't determine whether or not you're competent at game design. Sexual orientation doesn't determine whether or not you're competent at game design. Gender doesn't determine whether you're competent at game design. Religion doesn't determine whether or not you're competent at game design.<br />
<br />
You want to know what does determine whether or not you're competent at game design? Three things: Education, Professional Experience, and Diversity of Thought. Ideas that differ from that of the collective, that may offer perspective that other people lack. The ability to look at a problem differently from others and propose solutions that are more efficient as a result. Diversity of Thought is not obtained through hiring all walks of life. It is obtained through the evaluation of individuals based on their merits, even going so far as to hire someone you disagree with if only to break up the GroupThink.<br />

Also, it goes both ways. Currently playing in EU servers and saying I'm American makes things go sour real soon very often, but that's always been true. One of the first friends I made online when I came to this country over a decade ago was a Brit so I got used to playing in both regions and it's always been the same. Americans are more open and loud about conflict, while you people bring the animosity bundled up with passive aggressiveness to a whole new level of uncomfortable.

The Running of the Gnomes has always been on one single realm Scarlet Crusade.....this year though Blizzard also made it a Micro Event to push for attention too the run that has been going on for 8 yrs now. You could of attended all you had to do is make a US stater account and could of ran with us on SC realm. There is talk of bring it too EU realms but that would me the Leader of Group would have to get and maintain a EU account on top of a US account too.

<br />
So, if Blizz hire more black people, what &quot;new ideas and perspectives&quot; is it that you think they will they be bringing to the team, based purely on their skin colour? Where the best chicken shops are? <br />
<br />
Diversity of skin colour doesn't equate to diversity of thought and opinions. Skin colour is just that. While there are certainly huge differences in life experiences of every individual, this whole idea that hiring people who are physically more diverse will automatically bring a wider range of different ideas and views is laughable.... and pretty racist.<br />
<br />
<br />
The recruitement bias is obvious even when not explicit. Doing something about it is a good things. At least better than burying their heads in the ground and keep telling themselves &quot;herp derp we only hire the best one nothing to improve here&quot;.<br />
<br />
They recruit out of the pools of people available for the jobs. This whole lack of women in computer engineering isn't some big misogynist issue that needs fixing. Modern feminism has such a strong connection with femmephobia now that ANY traditional male roles or occupations with higher proportions of men are seen as aspirational, and any differences between them are put down to oppression of women. Not... you know... the idea that women can actually have their own opinions and make their own choices about these things ;)<br />
<br />
The reality is that for DECADES our society has shown programmers and &quot;gamers&quot; as no-life bearded losers who live in their mums basements. That fat warcraft guy from Southpark? That's basically how people see computer engineers. It's never been portrayed as aspirational, so why would people want to do it? This stigma of computer nerds is mostly in the USA and the West, which is why the proportions of female engineers is very different in other countries. <br />
Technology in general didn't really become &quot;cool&quot; until Smartphones started becoming huge. A lot of the old views on technology have been changing over the past decades, you just need to wait for this to start filtering through colleges and workpaces. <br />
<br />
<br />
YOu ever heard of Marvel comics? They seem to be on that level.<br />
<br />
One of the big issues is that companies are using &quot;Diversity&quot; as a publicity trick. Either to get positive publicity, or to avoid bad publicity from riled up people that have made it their agenda. <br />
Marvel tried to make &quot;diversity&quot; into a Event, to get publicity and to drive sales. Like with all of their events, there was never any real priority in telling great stories and, imo, the fact some of these series are actually pretty great is more a happy fluke. Some of them are just TERRIBLE. Marvel then saying their fans were turned away because of &quot;diversity&quot; was the final straw for a lot of fans.<br />
&quot;Diversity&quot; clearly wasn't an issue for fans back when the X-Men were by far Marvels biggest selling title for decades - a very diverse group, dominated by strong, smart and powerful women, led (for a while) by an African Woman,</div></div><hr />

<br />
Diversity of skin colour doesn't equate to diversity of thought and opinions. Skin colour is just that. While there are certainly huge differences in life experiences of every individual, this whole idea that hiring people who are physically more diverse will automatically bring a wider range of different ideas and views is laughable.... and pretty racist.<br />
<br />
So according to this line of thinking, black and white people in this country live roughly the same lives? They don't, and we both know that. Weather its racism, or cultural things, an average black life and an average white life in this country are different, mostly in that black people on average will live worse lives than whites b/c of vast income differences, and racism. It should not be that way, but it is how it is.<br />
<br />
That is, by definition, going to bring a new perspective, b/c they live different lives. <br />
<br />
Care to contest anything I said?</div></div><hr />

Yes, because you're being pretty racist and don't even realise it. <br />
<br />

Pretty sure there are quite a few that do.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
WTF is the the &quot;average&quot; black person or the &quot;average&quot; white person?<br />
<br />
Since when was it fine making policies about &quot;the average&quot; person of a particular race or nationality? <br />
<br />
By making policies about an &quot;average&quot; person of a race, we're making MASSIVE assumptions about that person, their life and their past, based purely on their skin colour. Is this not what we're trying to avoid in our society? . <br />
<br />
EVERYONE lives different lives. People have different lives and different perspectives. I just don't concur with the idea that JUST BECAUSE OF THEIR SKIN COLOUR, their differences in thoughts and perspectives will be greater and more valuable to a company than, as an example, two people of the same race who have grown up in different continents with different cultures and in different economic positions than each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
black people on average will live worse lives than whites b/c of vast income differences, and racism<br />
And you really think it's these worse off people that are going to be benefiting the most from these &quot;diversity&quot; quotas and not people from middle-class families with enough money to have put their kids through college for the engineering degrees?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hinastorm</div><div class="date">2017-10-15, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Study after study has shown that black people, as a whole, make less than other races. We could argue all day about why that is, but not really what we're discussing atm. I consider myself left leaning, and if its racist? to point out the aggregate results of studies, i'll gladly accept the title.<br />
<br />
Not sure if you were aware, from a earlier post about this from bliz, they are encouraging and seeking out more women and people of color to APPLY, they flat out stated they do not have quotas. Believe that or not, is up to you. <br />
<br />
If I did not make it clear that we're discussing this on a macro level, I apologize. Of course some black people live basically identical lives to white people. However, many do not, chiefly b/c of the large disparity in income.<br />
<br />
Also, while some studies have shown diversity helps Bliz's stated goal (bringing in different viewpoints), other studies show it does not make much of an effect.<br />
<br />
I'll close with: So, we should not make laws based on avarages? If it is clearly shown that black people, on average, make far less than whites, and it is shown that it is largely due to racism ( A big and hard to answer question, yes. This is a hypothetical) we should not make laws to address it? Why? Cause the top 10% of black people doing as well as the average white person? I'm having trouble understanding your apparent hate for averages.<br />
<br />
Theres alot more to say, if you want to continue discussing, i'm assuming you're not a troll, so far.<br />
<br />
edit: to be clear on something, I don't support quotas either, I think they are a well intentioned, but incorrect approach.</div></div><hr />

Didn't I just explain how it's not the same thing. It's typical for people like you to ignore what others say if you don't agree with them.<br />

I just realized something. Blizzard talks about diversity and claim to embrace it yet this event was only on US. They screw EU players like always. Of course the profits go to breast cancer research. That's sexist. How about breast and prostate cancer research? That's equality.</div></div><hr />

Also, it goes both ways. Currently playing in EU servers and saying I'm American makes things go sour real soon very often, but that's always been true. One of the first friends I made online when I came to this country over a decade ago was a Brit so I got used to playing in both regions and it's always been the same. Americans are more open and loud about conflict, while you people bring the animosity bundled up with passive aggressiveness to a whole new level of uncomfortable. Just culture shock.<br />
<br />
(Sorry to be late to the party, didn't really read my notifications.)<br />
<br />
It is interesting that your first thought was that I was bragging. I wasn't btw, and it wasn't the point. <br />
<br />
And I never met with your experience regarding my region, but other Americans had my experience - seeing the responses. But your sourness is an example, that you thought the worst about me/my comment, speaks loudly. And you talk about animosity. Well, anyway, best wishes.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, that won't work. I specifically mentioned it is mostly culture shock not something particularly heinous about either behavior. Americans tend to be loud and violent, you guys tend to mask it with passive aggressiveness and cynicism. I mean just read your reply, I think it speaks loudly. But anecdotes are anecdotes anyway.<br />
