EU is almost always 24hours behind. But this is a hotfix, it means on every server ASAP. Method last pulls was allready on nerfed boss.</div></div><hr />

Nobody forced them to finish their raid. They can play at any time. Call them and tell them to resume if you think that they can claim world first because of that change.</div></div><hr />

Kil’Jaeden wouldn’t have been killed until everyone was in Antorus gear. Artificial difficulty is not real difficulty, and even after the nerfs KJ was filled with artificial difficulty.</div></div><hr />

In this case more casual players can kill the boss with perfect gear. But Uu'nat is being done by pro players with almost perfect gear and they still struggle to beat the boss. What hope is there for players that aren't in the 0.1%. This boss is heavily overtuned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a difference between a hard boss and an unkillable one. Uu'nat falls into the same category as Kil'jaeden. KJ was literally impossible because Blizzard did 0 testing on it on Mythic, Method was very open about it by saying in 2 days of full progress on KJ, their best pulls were 85-90%. But KJ was an extreme case, Uu'nat is actually somewhat doable until the few overlaps in last phase where previously it was just &quot;get lucky&quot; due to the overlaps of abilities.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It just goes to show the only testing they did on teh boss was to make sure the game didn't crash and people didn't fall thru the floor anymore.</div></div><hr />

If C’thun wasn’t fixed he’d still be unkillable. How’s that for a raid boss lasting over a decade?</div></div><hr />

Yeah Mythic, hc is freeloot</div></div><hr />

It wasn't just overtuned, it was actually unkillable until the previous set of hotfixes rolled out, so much so, that some guilds just stopped day raiding because it was pointless to even try. With these changes, however, it might enable the race to rage on once again.</div></div><hr />

People thought Yogg 0 was unkillable and then Stars brought a dozen Afflocks and Spriests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How you can be so dense? Was fun fight? Faceroll? So why noone even killed this boss yet?</div></div><hr />
