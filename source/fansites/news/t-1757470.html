Get Your BlizzCon Tickets This Week<br />
You can see what was in the Goody Bag last year (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4474-Blizzcon-2014-Day-0-Goody-Bag) to get an idea of what to expect this year.<br />
Just a reminder to set your alarms and sync up with your traveling companions: BlizzCon 2015 general admission tickets go on sale this week (http://www.eventbrite.com/e/blizzcon-november-6-7-2015-tickets-15752495137) in two batches—one on Wednesday, April 15 at 7 p.m. PDT, and a second on Saturday, April 18 at 10 a.m. PDT. When the time comes, head to the BlizzCon ticketing page at the link below to try for tickets, and check out our original announcement (http://blizz.ly/BlizzCon2015) for all the details.<br />
<br />
A Bit o’ Good Goody Bag News<br />
If you can’t make it to the show in person, this year there’ll be a whole new way to bring a piece of the BlizzCon experience home: For the first time ever, Virtual Ticket buyers will have the option to purchase a BlizzCon Goody Bag of their own. Supplies will be limited, and some regional restrictions will apply—we’ll share additional information closer to the Virtual Ticket’s launch, so keep an eye on BlizzCon.com in the months ahead.<br />
<br />
*NEW FOR 2015* Ticket Delivery and Making Name Changes<br />
Keep in mind that ticket buyers have until August 14 to change the names on each ticket they’ve purchased. That means:<br />
<br />
<br />
For ticket buyers: If you bought tickets through Eventbrite and reassign them to someone else, make sure you tell the person you assigned it to previously that their ticket has been reassigned and will no longer grant entry to the show.<br />
For people who received tickets: If someone else bought tickets for you, double-check with them that your ticket is still in your name after the name-change deadline rolls around (August 14). <br />
<br />
<br />
IMPORTANT: In order to pick up a badge at BlizzCon, the name on your ticket must match the name on your photo ID, as well as the name assigned to the ticket in the ticketing system.<br />
<br />
That means if the ticket was reassigned to someone else without your knowledge and you show up to BlizzCon anyway, we won’t be able to give you a badge—so be careful when acquiring a ticket from a source you don’t know and trust.<br />
<br />
One other important change for ticket buyers: This year, you’ll be able to access and reprint your tickets at any time through your Eventbrite account. That means no more waiting around for us to send out a badge email, and no need to worry if you or your attendees lose that email or they get caught in your Spam filter.<br />
<br />
BlizzCon 2015 tickets go on sale Wednesday, April 15 at 7 p.m. PT and Saturday, April 18 at 10 a.m. through www.blizzcon2015.eventbrite.com. Good luck, and we look forward to seeing everyone there!</div></div><hr />

In reality they are asking you to pay to watch them advertise you there next game. Stuff like that should be free. Fair enough charging for actually being there in person as they have other things going on. But they could always just stream the event online for free, plenty of companies would let them do it for free if they are allowed to run a few adverts. <br />

Hope it is 6.2 :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
First off, thats pretty damn offensive calling someone &quot;retarded&quot;...use your words a little more wisely.<br />
<br />
Also, they have had to cut many things from different expansions. I'm not trying to defend them, but saying blizzcon is a waste of money is an opinion, but saying that they &quot;lie&quot; to you at it is wildly false. If you don't want to go, don't go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's nothing else they've announced that would require a PTR, the token is the last thing they tested. 8 hour downtime - this is probably a significant test of something.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't expect a lot right away - if 6.2 is a significant patch, and especially if it's a raid patch, things will be added slowly over the course of the PTR. The size of the patch when it comes up will say a lot.<br />
<br />
Plus, if it's a raid patch, it's going to be up a while- so this may just be the groundwork for what's coming later.<br />
<br />
Keep your expectations low, so if it's good, it's a better surprise! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Half? Really?<br />
<br />
You'll need to back that up with a comparative analysis.<br />

<br />
Blatant truth? What blatant truth?<br />
<br />
I was speaking to the assertion that half of what blizzard says about wow at blizzcon doesn't make it into the game. That is what I would call a blatant exaggeration.<br />
<br />
I wasn't defending anything, I was wondering if the person who said that could actually prove it... <br />
<br />
My greater point is that people who complain about this game have no issue making things up to support their claims.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm did. That's why we got patch 4.1 AKA Zul'Again when Firelands wasn't ready and the Abyssal Maw raid got cut. Though at least Zul'Again had a quest line and two dungeons... its more than I can say for 6.1.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure the people that go to blizzcon aren't there for the goodie bag. They are there for the community and the entertainment. It is a huge difference watching it live on your computer/tv and being there. A HUGE difference that even this goodie bag won't dent.</div></div><hr />

The 3rd chapter of Starcraft 3 went into beta March 31st. It's not out of the question it will launch at Blizzcon, or be a focus of it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Perhaps not big announcements, but at least a decent chunk of interesting information.<br />
<br />
Next WoW expansion, more info/trailler on Warcraft movie, possibly info/details on Warcraft RTS remakes, more Overwatch details, future plans for Diablo, Starcraft, Hearthstone and Heroes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the kinds of reactions that the Devs have gotten over their announcements of upcoming design changes (no flying, no Karabor/Bladespire faction hubs), it might be possible that 6.2 just get's &quot;dropped&quot; on the PTR.<br />
<br />
Also considering recent fan backlash, especially over the dismal performance of 6.1. I'd be willing to bet that whatever it is that is headed for the PTR, it's going to be a major game changer or at least a hint of one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And again people upset with their personal whims not being the focus will harp on again about &quot;promises&quot; not one of them has proven were made, yet will still insist on the existence of.<br />
<br />
There are people playing the game who aren't you.<br />
Blizzard are trying to cater to as many as possible, but as usual some just throw tantrums over them not being the sole focus.<br />
There are parts of the game unappealing to me personally, but I just accept it.<br />
More of you should be mature enough to do the same.<br />
Vote with your money rather than your mouth.<br />
<br />
If I had more money then I would certainly consider one of the goody bags, though it will be interesting to see the cost as that will largely dictate the initial price at least of those being sold on ebay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's going to be a Protoss Murloc this year. Legacy of the Void is due for release. <br />
<br />
Then again so is Heroes of the Storm.</div></div><hr />
