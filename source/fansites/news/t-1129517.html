How is it an unfair estimate? A paid subscriber, is still a paid subscriber. The annual pass doesn't excuse you from paying...unless I'm missing something. :confused:</div></div><hr />

The annual pass only had 1.2-1.5million people sign up. Which means that about 9 million people still play without any kind of agreement locking them in.</div></div><hr />

i agree with the annual pass part, and the DS part. If they try pull a ICC move with DS there subs are screwed. They wouldnt survive much</div></div><hr />

It's not really unfair, those are paying customers. Some of them probably aren't playing much if at all, but paying customers is still the best metric there is to measure a subscription based game.</div></div><hr />

I assume he's talking about the Diablo 3 numbers, now the WoW numbers. I for one signed up for the annual pass to get into the beta. I didn't like Diablo and never played Diablo 2, I don't care much about D3 but I still count as having preordered it. I don't think its unfair to use anyone like me in the numbers but I see what he means.</div></div><hr />

My alt's guild only got their first Madness kill in a couple weeks ago, and haven't started heroics yet.

Just being honest man, wow was always a great game up until CATA, sure it lost 2 million subs but it just shows that people want things handed on a plate as 4.3 stabilised subs. I doubt anyone with a IQ higher then 110 can still be enjoying this game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two unnamed games, one is &quot;Titan&quot;, curious about the other...<br />
<br />
I was a tad surprised that it didnt drop a bit given that &quot;content consumption&quot; was an issue. With the new recruit a friend program that could have helped leveled the subscription numbers. The leveling off potentially shows that there are not much players who seem to want to come back to the current expansion(Cata) even with its LFR system and other aspect of the game getting easier. With MoP and its focus on bringing more things to do from solo to group based players instead of the streamlined and gutted experience we got in Cata, I hope to see an increase in returning players. The growing toxicity of the community however is something I would like to go down.</div></div><hr />

You can't bring down monopoly by copying a success of another company, like BW did. The best way to &quot;break monopoly&quot; and &quot;diversify the market&quot; is to create high quality product targeted at specific audience, instead of mindlessly ripping off WoW.</div></div><hr />

Let's come back when the 15 mil are announced. What Haters don't understand is Pandas are wildly popular, combine that with Pokemon, and you have a wave of new subs.<br />

haters gonna hate thats what haters do, Annual pass doesnt change a thing about sub numbers it is just offering bonus and perks to those of us that would been subbing regardless it is a perk for the most loyal of customers they got. That is probably why the attempts to discredit the numbers. Not to name any names of any other game but if they had showed no decline they would be cheering and saying it is rebounding. <br />
<br />
a very good report for sure for blizzard. Future is looking promising.

MoP won't take that long. 5 more months would make it the longest WoW beta ever by a month or more. Heck the entire beta for Wrath was only 5 months long. We just got a patch that increased the level cap to 89. At the pace they are on, we will be able to hit 90 by the end of May at the latest. End game testing will be 2 months tops, likely less, and can continue right up until release if needed.

I assume that stands for One Billion Dollar Intellectual Property (someone can correct me if I'm wrong). I believe it. We have 22 of the Skylanders and 2 adventure packs. This game is tons of fun, but one hell of an investment with the Adventure packs being $20-$25 each and single Skylanders $8-$10 or 3 packs for $20-$25 and the game itself being $60 for the game, 3 Skylanders and the Portal of Power.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have to agree, It looks really good so far cant wait until getting the pet battles etc unlocked, Challenge mode runs of dungeons, probably best new feature in the game. looks promising for sure, And i can see MoP picking up a pretty good chunk of the lost subs of the last 2 years. Combine that with improving economy and it can clearly be seen that the game is going to recover.</div></div><hr />

Heck the entire beta for Wrath was only 5 months long. We just got a patch that increased the level cap to 89. At the pace they are on, we will be able to hit 90 by the end of May at the latest. End game testing will be 2 months tops, likely less, and can continue right up until release if needed. Personally I expect a release date announcement and 5.0 PTR somewhere in the early part of June with a release around August.<br />
<br />
Not the mention the MoP beta is one of the most complete beta's Blizzard has ever done. (Sure there are those stand out bugs but they will be squashed in a timely fashion). I expect the MoP beta to take even less then previous beta's, meaning a summer release date, late summer at the latest. Blizzard isn't going to give us another eight months of Dragon Soul, they wouldn't dare if they want to keep even their subs up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
League of legends finds it cute that you would cheer over a mere 15 mllion subs ;)<br />
<br />
Gotta say this is quite suprising considering how many subs were lost when there was content out, but i guess that a mix of annual pass lock-ins (several friends who got the annual pass have said that they wish they hadn't because they want out of the game but can't), SoR (i got tempted to get a free char, but i did not want to help blizz pretend i was an active subscriber) and MoP hype managed to stabilize it. Although I do find it curious when people cheer over the game being stale and not growing, you must be really confident. <br />
<br />
The next big question will be what the numbers will be for Q2, as SoR has come and gone, and the Q1 also counts accounts that were still active january 1st. I would not be suprised if we saw another &quot;please come back to us&quot; promotional july to try and keep Q2 numbers from dropping. And of course numbers will go up with MoP release, they always do, the question is how much they go up, and how many will drop off after the release.<br />
<br />
Wotlk launch reduced wow to the lowest point in it's entire history in terms of time being spent playing the game.<br />
Cata cost them 2 million subscribers. <br />
MoP has a lot to live up to if it wants to reverse the trend and the question remains whether pokemon and wotlk content will be enough for that (as heroics in mop will be same diff as wotlk according to blizz earlier this year).<br />

I doubt it. I mean, sure, there are some people stuck with annual passes that have decided since they no longer want to play... but those that care about things like getting in beta or in-game mounts are the ones most likely to stick around. <br />

Indeed, hence why I have never seen the appeal of any other MMO released during WoW's lifetime.<br />
<br />
But as you see some of the newer games have not tried to cater to the jack-of-all-trades attitude. Whilst I'm not a fanboy, I'd say design paths such as GW2 which actively steer away from PvE for the most part shows the industry starting to realise this at last.</div></div><hr />

To be honest I believe there are so many people that invest their entire lives into World of Warcraft or they just wouldn't leave the game they love so much until the last server closes that it wouldn't even drop beneath four million subscribers. Those numbers alone will still have it be the number one P2P MMO in the market.<br />
<br />
Blizzard even said they will continue supporting World of Warcraft even 20 years after Titan releases, have them stay hand in hand.</div></div><hr />

My like or dislike of WoW isn't based on how many other people are still forking out for a monthly sub.

Wheres is the trick? <br />
- Diablo 3<br />
- Beta access<br />

... all that for a 12 month sub which in my case ( and others ) would happen either way. This is quite a bargain.<br />

It really depends on how you do terminology.<br />

Some people would call $40 expansions a game, and I think Blizzard would see them as games also.<br />

Also realize just because Blizzard said they expect only two games doesn't mean they will have all three, D3, MoP, and HotS. (I doubt DOTA is close to done yet and we will receive it this year)</div></div><hr />

2 days ago Tera was chosen as the new WoW killer.<br />
<br />
The Old Republic announced a nearly 25% drop in subscribers.<br />
<br />
I was bracing to have to hold back a tide of &quot;exodus to Tera!&quot; threads when the latest drop came out.<br />
<br />
<br />
In this last quarter, which was a referendum on 4.3, Mists of Pandaria, and the new casual-friendly design, WoW emerged unscathed. While it could have been better, we proved that the anti-casual panda people that were jumping ship was in fact equalized by those who took the plunge back (or for the first time) into WoW because of these changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
We proved that despite what the doomsayers said, MoP would not kill WoW.</div></div><hr />

It's that lull between expansions combined with Cata disappointing. It happens. WoW was losing subs and Blizzard was came up with a plan. It's called smart marketing. And if you want to talk about Blizzard giving away free stuff, what do you call SWTOR giving away a free month for a 6 month old game? What's your excuse for that?

<br />
- We've seen the MoP beta which caused a massive hype and should have increased the subs, didn't happen though.<br />
- People that had the annual pass still have it.<br />
- People that could stand 4.3 to begin with probably still can.<br />
<br />
So sorry to tell you guys, take the hands out of your pants, because you didn't win either.<br />
<br />
Why would a beta increase subs for a game where you don't even play what's in the beta in the full game? People aren't going to sub back up for MoP until MoP is actually released.<br />
<br />
I would call a steady subscription after Star Wars the Old Republic and the expansion lull a COMPLETE &quot;win&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thuran</div><div class="date">2012-05-09, 09:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got stuck at the part where you would even grasp the thought to compare the subs of a Free to Play MOBA game where you do the same thing over and over again to a $15 a month Pay to Play MMORPG game.<br />
<br />
And yet, free to play games tend to make more money and get more growth than pay-to-play games. Nothing is keeping blizzard from going free to play on wow, and it is fair to compare them as the time investment is not all that different nor are the expenses, and the payment model is part of a game, even if it does not directly impact gameplay.<br />
<br />
Besides, it's you guys flagging 10 and 15 million subscribers as something huge, or using it as an argument for why wow is a good game. I'm pretty sure that twilight is NOT better than most other movies, regardless of how much money it made or how many people saw it. Hell, by that measure, Avatar is the best movie ever made, and it's not fair to compare it to movies that don't charge you 50% extra for the glasses, or movies that are free to watch.<br />
<br />
Fact remains that people are cheering over wow not losing subs, and seem to forget that it has not been the biggest game in the world, or even 2nd biggest game in the world for years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The BIGGEST challenge ever for WOW was launched back in Dec 2011.<br />
<br />
And WOW didn't massively lost subscriptions like the &quot;industry analists&quot; predicted.<br />
<br />
Some said that the launch of SW TOR alone would add another 1.5 to 2 million losses ON TOP of it all.<br />
<br />
It didn't happen: because the challenger was WAY below the quality WOW players are used to - as always - I might say...<br />
<br />
Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

It happens. WoW was losing subs and Blizzard was came up with a plan. It's called smart marketing.

Blizzard doing it is bad, but SWTOR doing it is good?<br />
<br />
Could care less about SW:ToR<br />
<br />
My problem is these numbers were bloaded up with free stuff (yes Cata costs more than 1 month of SW:ToR subs) and people did not come back, they quit soon after. This is a gimmick that barely kept them above water stop calling it a success.</div></div><hr />

Please ohh Maestro, explain to me when 'the old days' were that required more skill than time?<br />
<br />
Vanilla? where a raid team had to farm for hours pre raid? The honour grind to HWL?<br />
<br />
BC where attunements meant guilds had to re run old content countless times to attune any new members (regardless of any skill level)? FOTM arena?<br />

<br />
Please, since it doesn't require skill anymore...tell me how I can get those shiny Gladiator mounts...I wants them. And please, let me get all 100% drop mounts from Heroic bosses without doing anything...because right now, I haven't been handed a damn thing in this game that I want without having to spend tons of time and effort into it. <br />
<br />
There's easy content to be had, there's punishing content to be had. YOU seem to be stuck back in Vanilla where an epic mount was among the biggest success one could achieve...things change. some thousands and thousands of years ago it was a big thing lighting fire on a stick for humans and not getting eaten by a wooly beast with wonky eyes...would you want to go back to those times?<br />
<br />
People claiming that nothing in WoW requires skill, are most likely being heavily carried OR they're not good enough to pursue the hardest content and simply label the game from what they themselves can reach...the easier content.</div></div><hr />

They would be happy to get 5% of it, but they don't have to support their game as much as Blizzard does.<br />

I concur. Given that a lot of people who would have been thought to come back around the holidays and had an active subscription in Q1, there should have been some form of an increase.<br />

I've never undertood such a fascination for the number of people playing instead of discussing its quality. Justin Bieber is popular, is Justin Bieber producing quality music?<br />
<br />
Quality is completely based on perspective.<br />
<br />
I could say World of Warcraft is the highest quality game in the world, and I would be right.<br />
<br />
Another could say World of Warcraft has the worst quality of any game, and they would be right.<br />
<br />
But only to themselves, not to other people.<br />
<br />
To me World of Warcraft has a vast amount of game play, I have invested over 200 days over a few years and I haven't even come close to doing all I could do in the game. Other people could do all they would ever want to do in the game in just a month and either be happy with it or think of it as sucky. All perspective based.</div></div><hr />

Oh please, it will probably be late august at the latest. MoP is one of the most finished beta's I've ever seen, I mean they are already almost to the nit pick stage. Cata was no where near this level at this time when it was in beta, and it shows. MoP is shaping up to be one of the most well put to gather expansions yet. I mean there were even official artwork leaked back during WRATH.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">avatariku</div><div class="date">2012-05-09, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is my first time posting here ever, idk if you can check but if you can go ahead Im not lying, anyway I wanted to just say a couple things. <br />
<br />
First I am also on the annual pass yet I quit WoW not too long after I got it. A year long commitment to a game like WoW is too long to foresee sticking around without any doubt at all throughout that time. I guarantee you if they added a option to cancel the annual pass, many people would do it. Sure you were playing at the tie, like myself, but people get bored, stuff happens, and you end up quitting when you thought you wouldn't. Just because in your case you are still playing even after getting the annual pass, then good job to you, but to apply your situation to every person who got the annual pass is idiotic. Many people would cancel it if given the choice, just the same as many people have been loving having the annual pass. <br />
<br />
Second, I am neither a ayer or nayer when it comes to blizz subs, be realistic, just because subs stabled out this quarter from last quarter doesn't mean the game is all peachy. Being realistic, alot of people are stuck with the annual pass who would happily cancel it given the choice, and the new scroll of rez is extremely enticing. Looking at the way we are as humans, even if someone has ANY thought of perhaps coming back to the game at all in the future, then an investment now by getting these &quot;promotions&quot; is a good thing and will be gotten regardless or not you actively play or not. Do I care if WoW stabilizes or not? not really, I am just realistic when it comes to these numbers. If you turn a blind eye at blizz's promotions to get subs up for the quarter review then you are simply pledging ignorance at the facts. Blizz plumps the numbers up, and while it is idiotic, even people who don't actively play, will still reach for those moutns, we all know how tempting a shiny mount is, sparkle pony is a great example, sounded and looked great for the first 10 minutes, enough to make you get it but then after the ooo shiny moment it just looked massively retarded. <br />
<br />
For the conclusion, guild wars 2, nough said.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why should we stop calling something we deem successful in our own eyes as a success? Blizzard has achieved more then I thought it would, and I am immensely happy with it at the moment. Who cares if Blizzard is good at marketing, they are a business. As long as they make me happy then they did well in my eyes.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Blizzard just has to hold on for a few more months until MoP comes out and they gain another influx of subscribers. And please don't say MoP won't be a success subscriber wise, you don't know jack about it until it has come and gone so no one can assume like that.</div></div><hr />

I've never undertood such a fascination for the number of people playing instead of discussing its quality. Justin Bieber is popular, is Justin Bieber producing quality music?<br />
<br />
It's because it's subjective, BUT...when 10 million + people enjoy a game, that's a pretty good pointer, wouldn't you say? Music is even more subjective at that so that's not really good to compare with. WoW has tons of content for many different types of players as long as they enjoy the basics of the game...a song is very black or white, you like it or you don't.<br />

To me Dire Straits is the greatest band that ever came to be, that makes it true TO ME. Why should I care if you or someone else feels that Backstreet boys fill that role? Same for games. To me WoW is THE best game, the game that's given me the most fun through the years and never let me down (and I tried GW2 at that) so I don't give a rats ass about someone else stating that some other game is THE BEST...it's not true to me.</div></div><hr />
