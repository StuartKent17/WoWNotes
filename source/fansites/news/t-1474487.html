I don't think it was really meant to be a milestone, so much as a way to get more people playing.</div></div><hr />

If not that then they want you to pay real money for one.<br />
<br />
Personally I'm glad this is a fairly simple acquisition. Rep-based mounts aside - they barely ever come out with a REALLY cool mount in this game that is simple to get or that doesn't cost RL money or an arm and a leg in-game to purchase.<br />
<br />
Blizz actually gets a +1 from me for this...even if I did have to d/l and play Hearthstone to get it.</div></div><hr />

It's there to get their huge WoW player base to try the game (and hopefully stick around and eventually buy some card packs). If they made it too annoying to get, fewer people would bother.</div></div><hr />

Yay lets reward the 3% of RNG that got into &quot;closed BETA&quot;. What a stupid comment to make. Thats like saying lets give everyone £1M for everyone born in 1950....&quot;oh sorry you was'nt born then? Sucks to be you..&quot; <br />

Yeah you would be as you got the invite. For the rest who didnt get the invite. bad luck. should not be a mount that everyone can get.</div></div><hr />

It's an achievement so my guess is this will be in the game for quite sometime.<br />

It is. The trailer for it also had the new Dwarf model at the 'card playing part'. As well as the new Orc model. I think it might have been the new Gnome model there, too. But I wasn't sure. Not a clear enough view.</div></div><hr />

Nah. Currently, and probably permanently blue for both factions. Even the promotional pics and trailer show it as blue for Troll and Blood Elves. Red is unavailable for now.<br />

You shouldn't be so 'on your toes'. Despite what the Social Justice Police would have you think, the use of the word rape unless it's super serious isn't the greatest crime, even beyond genocide. Don't worry, man.<br />

As a hunter, I have very few issues killing anything except priests or maybe mages.. Perhaps that garners me as much hate as I would get as a priest, but I'm probably not gonna waste a lot of time. I always thought I would like Hearthstone, but it turns out it's just not really my thing.<br />

You just need 3 wins, but they have to be in &quot;play&quot; mode (casual or ranked) or &quot;arena&quot; mode.</div></div><hr />

100%, it's so easy to win in Hearthstone when you are at the lowest rank, if you start today, you'll most likely know much about the game within 2 days, it's really easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casual can literally be anyone, from a new player to a seasoned legendary veteran. Meanwhile, ranked will put you with other players who are just starting as well, and are probably only playing to get the mount. I see a lot of rae about losing tons of games in a row, and I can almost guarantee they're playing casual and not ranked.</div></div><hr />

There are so many new people at rank 25 in ranked right now. Seriously, it is so easy right now. If you've lost over 10 games at this point with only 0 or 1 wins, it's because you're bad at CCGs, or playing &quot;casual&quot;, which for a new player will be misleading.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to spend cash to be competitive. Everything can be acquired in-game (except Golden Gelbin Mekkatorque, which is a reward for testing the store in BETA, and I think L90ETC is only for Blizzcon participants(?))</div></div><hr />

First off you gotta beat all the AI heroes at the beginning when you defeat illidan then you can go on to play against human players<br />
<br />
You need 3 wins against human players to win the mount. It took me about 20 games to get the hang of it but dont give up you will pick it up and before long you are pwning the guys who have only just started to play.<br />
<br />
Then you need to log off your battle.net and log back in to wow and it should be there in the mail if it isnt then you are either doing something wrong or there is a massive bug and you need to contact blizz about it.<br />
<br />
I have to admit there is something very addictive about hearthstone but there is noway i will ever pay IRL money for cards and shit.</div></div><hr />

Yup, been over an hour since I got the 3rd win and HS told me to go log into WoW to get my mount. Nothing. Restarted everything, logged out of the BNet client etc.<br />
<br />
I do have an old expired RAF account tied to my BNet account and I wonder if it applied it to the wrong account or got confused.<br />

Probably it's just slow or dropping packets on the floor between the games. I'm sure they'll get it sorted. In a week or so.<br />

from a blue post in the hearstone tech support forums:<br />
<br />
They're investigating the cause of the delay in Hearthsteed mounts being sent to World of Warcraft accounts now. It may just be a large number of people earning them has slowed down the system or it may be something else entirely. We'll have to wait and see what they find.</div></div><hr />

I agree and disagree, open should have gotten it too since they never announced HOW you got it until it went live. That way people who said &quot;Ew, stupid card game&quot; couldn't turn around and play it just for the mount. Reward those interested. Either way I like this mount, but really am sad the Black/Red one isn't in game. :(</div></div><hr />

You don't have to spend cash to be competitive. Everything can be acquired in-game (except Golden Gelbin Mekkatorque, which is a reward for testing the store in BETA, and I think L90ETC is only for Blizzcon participants(?))<br />

<br />
People are extremely cheap, especially ones who play F2P exclusively. Doubt many F2P'ers are like &quot;Oh cool a mount, all I have to do is buy a game and pay 15 a month to use it&quot;.<br />
<br />
I thank Blizzard for actually giving us, the loyal fans something for nearly nothing that isn't tied to some crap like RAF, or SoR. This promo, even if you are horrible, or hate the HS, it's 3 wins. I wish there were more tie-ins like this, milestones would be great. <br />
<br />
Annoying that some people want everything to be a challenge, so they can feel special. It doesn't matter, hell you think the guy who got the legendary amulet from MC back in the day still feels special? I think he was the only person who got it before it was removed from the game... People need to try harder at life, and just play for fun.<br />

I predicted the &quot;P2W!!!&quot; &quot;RNG BS&quot; &quot;THIS IS STUPID WOOOOOW&quot; comments would flood in.<br />
Y'all just have to get gud &lt;3. Getting 3 wins even when you're just starting should be easy-ish. If you can't seem to win with the basic free deck you were given, then just build your own. Just Google Trump basic mage deck, and you should see what cards you should really really avoid in your deck. I don't really remember how many basic cards you got though, but it wasn't that bad I think. You just have to hope there won't be a flood of legendary decks, but most of them are +20 by now. Or will be after evening in Ammuricah time.<br />
<br />
On a side note, I'm gonna make peoples lives miserable when EU gets this too. I'm sitting on rank 25 anyway.<br />
<br />
Edit: on a side side note. For those that are just trying out Hearthstone for the first time, don't let the constructed (Play) scare you away. The most fun, for me anyway, is the Arena where you don't have to slug through the endless waves of P2W you get in constructed. Since its all RNG more or less, making it quite unpredictable every game. Not for everyone of course, but do give it a spin before you drop the game.</div></div><hr />

If you just continue sucking for a while, the game gives you opponents of your caliber. <br />
If you keep losing long enough, at some point you might even encounter my grandma as an opponent, who hasnt quite figured out how to get the &quot;monster thingies&quot; on the board, but was intrested when she saw me play a cardgame :)<br />

The time limit is as followed. It ends when either:<br />
a) Blizzard quits Hearthstone.<br />
b) Blizzard quits WoW.<br />
<br />
Why should there be any time limit? It's cross promotion and it wouldn't make sense to limit the time...especially given that it ain't connected to an event(like the official release of Hearthstone or something like that).</div></div><hr />

If you keep losing long enough, at some point you might even encounter my grandma as an opponent, who hasnt quite figured out how to get the &quot;monster thingies&quot; on the board, but was intrested when she saw me play a cardgame :)<br />

No but some deck setups with certain legendaries really makes it hard, my burn deck did a good chunk oh damage. It will probably take a good 10 games to get a win.</div></div><hr />
