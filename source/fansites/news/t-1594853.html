Warning: Here be spoilers!* Go no further! Turn back now before it’s too late! You have been warned!<br />
<br />
The distant echoes of the Iron Horde’s war machine have already begun to reach the ears of Azeroth’s heroes. Soon, the journey into Draenor will begin in earnest—a journey filled with drama, tension, and momentous events that will shape the fate of this world.<br />
<br />
To tell this tale, we’ve created more high-quality in-game cinematic footage for Warlords of Draenor than ever before—and as your story unfolds, these cinematics will illustrate some of the key moments of your adventure.<br />
<br />
While we generally like to keep story beats like these a surprise, we know some players enjoy seeking out spoilers, and there are always plenty of people who find these files in the beta or on the PTR and share them. To help mitigate the potential for unsuspecting players to accidentally come across these and spoil their own adventure ahead of time, we’ve decided to go ahead and upload them ourselves—and provide plenty of caution and safeguards against watching them accidentally.<br />
<br />
Of course, it goes without saying that we recommend you wait and watch these videos in-game as they were meant to be encountered—but if you choose to watch them here below, we hope you enjoy them, and only ask that you allow others to experience the story as they choose. Thank you for your continued excitement and passion for World of Warcraft, and we’ll see you in Draenor!<br />
<br />
*What follows are the in-game cinematics that will play at various points during the Warlords of Draenor campaign. We encourage you to play the game and experience them in-context as you progress through Draenor—but if you decide to watch them now, don’t say you haven’t been warned!<br />

<br />
After umpfteen years on MMO C you should know that Blizzard explaining why they do things is NEVER an acceptable argument with the community. Or should I say...forum posters<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
And because we were just going to Datamine them anyways.<br />
<br />
Now THAT is indeed an argument</div></div><hr />

_________________________________________<br />
<br />
Dark Portal Intro: There's just something underwhelming about it. I guess just not enough enemies to really make you go, &quot;Whoa.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Dark Portal Outro: This actually was not too shabby at all. It did a good job setting the tone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frostfire Ridge Finale: So that's how Durotan becomes chieftain of the Frostwolves. Actually pretty sad but cool.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadowmoon Valley Finale: OK, that was awesome. I really enjoyed getting to see more emotion out of Velen's model. Also, does that mark Velen gave Yrel mean that she leads the AU draenei now?<br />
<br />
<br />
Talador Finale: Blizzard should not have killed off Maraad, gonna say it here and now. But the fight between Yrel and Durotan versus Blackhand was decent. Although the ending... we don't actually see Blackhand get killed by the explosion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nagrand Finale: So *we* don't get to be there to deal with Garrosh. And Thrall doesn't take any responsibility (even *partially* -- whatsoever for failing to tell Garrosh the *full* picture of his father way back during the events of Hero of the Mag'har (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/10212-hero-of-the-maghar). ARGH.<br />
<br />
Garrosh also doesn't fight so well, think Thrall should have been beaten up more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrison Cinematics Alliance and Horde: I liked seeing how the upgrades are going to be shown. And I 'll admit, I got a bit emotional about our character being called a general at the end. But other than those two things, there wasn't anything special about those cinematics.<br />
<br />
<br />
And those are my thoughts. I thought I'd be nice and use spoiler tags anyway even though... well... this is a spoilers-y website, which you should know by now. Have fun!</div></div><hr />

Not really a good look on an orc. I liked him better when he was an unapologetic jackass in War Crimes. Garrosh has always been super inconsistent and I just hope he doesn't have any surprise offspring and we can just put his storyline to bed once and for all now.</div></div><hr />

really? u liked wrathgate? it is silliest blizards cinemetic ever :o..like holywood american mobies...same words..same speeches...same pictures...same &quot;on time&quot; shit and everything else...this is much better...the 2 things that i didnt liked here is that thrall fights his own people/family and does not show any sighns of worry..like a robot he is...also...they showed marraad dies but didnt even showed for one moment orgrim doomhammer like he never existed :(</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is getting better, when we compare this to, say, Wrathgate.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone else find the Nagrand cinematic a bit sad? Garrosh's voice when he is trying to blame Thrall sounds a bit like hes about to cry<br />
<br />
Got the same feeling too.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Garrosh one leaves a bitter taste in my mouth. They did a good job at expressing Garrosh a bit, but Thrall saying that it's all Garrosh's fault is somewhat stupid. He should have at least taken some of the blame.<br />

Yeah, Thrall's last words were a bit on the Meh side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thrall went into Garrosh's room in SoO and asked him to put down the mantle of Warchief. Garrosh refused. Did Thrall screw up by putting Garrosh in charge in the first place? Probably. But Thrall took every opportunity to try to help Garrosh and yet he refused it every single time. It would be stupid at this point for Thrall to blame himself. Garrosh sealed his own fate by turning against the people he was supposed to lead.</div></div><hr />

I sincerely hope not; they are already titles in the game, and I got enough upset when they re-introduced them in Cataclysm after their hiatus. Adding in a tertiary source of them would be something I'd highly dislike.</div></div><hr />

Garrosh refused. Did Thrall screw up by putting Garrosh in charge in the first place? Probably. But Thrall took every opportunity to try to help Garrosh and yet he refused it every single time. It would be stupid at this point for Thrall to blame himself. Garrosh sealed his own fate by turning against the people he was supposed to lead.<br />
<br />
Thrall hardly took every opportunity to help Garrosh. It was more like &quot;oh shit, gotta go, Garrosh you can be Warchief now k&quot; and then he expected his advisers to do the actual teaching. Thrall is a retard for putting Garrosh into the position without properly educating him on how a Warchief should lead, and he should take some blame for what he did. He already knew Garrosh suffered from emotional issues, and it should have come to no surprise that the son who grew up in the shadow of his father ended up becoming exactly like him.</div></div><hr />

Thrall in the Nagrand one, the &quot;Noo... You choose your own destiny...&quot;... The emotion in that line was amazing. I know I have seen several people going &quot;Thrall took no responsibility&quot; and it makes me wonder if they even watched the video. Just because its not said in words does not mean its not said. The emotion you could hear in Thralls voice says it all. Its better than a stupid monolog of &quot;I failed, I was a failure, I suck, sorry guys.&quot;. It had weight to it, it was the truth but at the same time you could tell Thrall felt regret and disappointment pretty hard.<br />
<br />
As for Blackhand, that was just plain epic. The voice, the movements, the design, all of it truly fits Blackhand! I can not wait to fight Blackhand, he is such an awesome character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thrall is responsible to the horde for putting someone like Garrosh in charge, but he has no blame on Garrosh being a shitstain of such epic proportions. Bad move on part of Thrall, and he is on complete fault for his lack of hindsight, but Garrosh turning into a genocidal tyrant bent on ruling the world is not something Thrall has actual responsibility on. It is your own personal choices and none than your own what matter when you are put through the test and lots of pressure. That is all on Garrosh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrathgate was quite good for its day. Yes, the animations leave something to be desired compared to what we have now, but in my opinion it still stands on its own feet due mainly to how big an event in lore it was. (And a real shame that it was only available for the duration of WotLK. Boo.)</div></div><hr />

Thrall not abiding by the rules of the Mak'gora, is Thrall's way of proving a point to Garrosh. He is saying that being a leader is something that you cant do on your own. Garrosh lead the horde by not listening to anyone but himself, or the orcs, and not listening to the rest of the horde. When thrall says that he doesnt rely on strength alone, hes basically teaching Garrosh one final lesson that you cant forsake everyone around you, you need to embrace all the help you can get.</div></div><hr />

Then what weapon will Grommash be wielding if not this iconic axe? He holds it in other videos (e.g. the Dark Portal Outro). I sure don't hope that Blizzard will make a major lapse like creating several Gorehowls.<br />
<br />
P.s. Well, on the other hand it would not be the first time for Gorehowl's circumstances to be rather ominous, with it winding up in Malchezaar's hands after Grom's death, from there somehow going to Thrall who gives it to Garrosh.</div></div><hr />

he has only pointed out that he is weak and cannot fight the way it is supposed to be.Garrosh never was alone, he had plenty of advisors. justification of this green shit with balls on the neck is simply disgusting. Garrosh was right about it: it is orc no longer. Garrosh Hellscream was the best horde warchief. just because idiotic plot turned his 'allied' against him only proves that 1. blizzard writing is terrible 2. horde needs an iron fist to the face for their traitorous behaviours. taurens were supposed to follow horde to the hell and vol'jin could not even challenge Garrosh to mak'gora, only threatened him from the shadows like a pisspot he is. <br />
the horde we obey now is an organisation of traitors and lowest of scum. Garrosh would annihilate all of the lesser races and stabilise Horde for the future with vast resources and land to breed on. blizzard takes route of a marxist hero. 'seek help, mister collective hero'.</div></div><hr />

Ah okay, thanks for clearing that up for me. It just seemed he was becoming the Naaru from the perspective of the cinematic and made me think back to Sunwell when MU Velen purified a Void God back to a Naaru and used it's power on the Sunwell without sacrificing himself. Still think it strange that he would know Yrel the prisoner girl would be become a great leader for their people when MU Velen can't even get his visions of the Army of light right.<br />

<br />
Hmm it's possible that's true. But then again Garrosh did take council from the other leaders plenty of Orcs when he was first Warchief (and in fact did grow to distrust his advisors after finding out a fellow Orc and closest advisor worked for the Twilights Hammer Clan so it's not hard to understand why he didn't trust many people in MoP). But then again it doesn't feel like Thrall is teaching Garrosh a lesson in the end at all by killing him. Rather he's trying to smother his mistakes he made with Garrosh and bury them so he doesn't have to face them again.

The elements where they are fighting literally want to tear Garrosh apart. Its his judgement day. Hell is rising from the ground to consume him. Thrall has to reap what he has sown; stooping to dark levels in the process.</div></div><hr />

But then again Garrosh did take council from the other leaders plenty of Orcs when he was first Warchief (and in fact did grow to distrust his advisors after finding out a fellow Orc and closest advisor worked for the Twilights Hammer Clan so it's not hard to understand why he didn't trust many people in MoP). But then again it doesn't feel like Thrall is teaching Garrosh a lesson in the end at all by killing him. Rather he's trying to smother his mistakes he made with Garrosh and bury them so he doesn't have to face them again. Also by not following the rule of Mak'gora he in fact was detrimental to the Horde by showing Garrosh's Iron Horde sect army that he was not a strong and honourable leader so they wouldn't be swayed from Grommash's Horde.<br />
in the end he has proven that he is weak an dirty little runt who used powers of the elements. 1v1 hah, all elements used against one man. <br />
no ruler should obiedently trust. Garrosh told him the truth, about leaving horde in pieces. now we know that metzen faced orc is weakling</div></div><hr />

I really wish Blizzard would have done a bit more with Garrosh, but when you tie everything together the character actually does feel really complete. What seemed like a character that flops all over the place in direction towards where he is going actually gets tied up into a neat little package. The character most obviously has massive insecurities and ultimately while all of these were his decisions and his choices, he just felt alone and abandoned.<br />
<br />
Garrosh really has father issues and he looked towards Thrall as his father. When Thrall left during the events of Cataclysm and beyond, Garrosh didn't have the guidance he wanted and was surrounded by those that he didn't respect or want guidance from at all.<br />
<br />
Thrall didn't fail him, but Garrosh's entire life was void of a father figure to set him on the right path, and in the end he did what he thought was the best. It ended up being the wrong thing, but you can tell he wished it was different and that he wished he had guidance.<br />
<br />
And please, Thrall had to be the one to do Garrosh in. You don't build up a character over half a decade only to let him be beaten by somebody new or a group of nobodies. It's a good ending to the character, and pretty poetic if you consider that the location they fought in is where GARADAR would have been in that universe. That same Garadar where Thrall met Garrosh for the first time and started to build him up. It's the same location that he ends up dying in as well.</div></div><hr />

Thrall carries the responsibility for making Garrosh warchief. What followed was genocide. Because Thrall's judgement was bad, Orgrimmar was sacked.

genocide? so what? really, what is so wrong about genocide? puff, they would disappear, all of these mongrels would be gone. horde would have lands, minerals and goods. hat followed was not-very-much surprising plot betrayal by the trolls and tauren. it is like reading some manga: B must turn bad because story must go on. reminds me of new naruto chapters.</div></div><hr />

wat, I don't know what's so female sounding about the name Tojara, but to each his own.<br />
<br />
Thrall left the Horde with who he thought would offer great guidance. Garrosh however clearly didn't want the guidance of any of those people.<br />
<br />
Garrosh did what he felt was the BEST he could do under the circumstances handed to him, but he also felt like he was left a bad hand. He didn't get the guidance he wanted and was left to pick up the mantle of warchief in rather difficult times. Thrall picked up Garrosh and gave him his confidence back in Nagrand, but he can't make the all of his choices for him.<br />
<br />
As far as Thrall 'cheating', it sort of doesn't matter. If you read the short story the elements on Draenor HATE Garrosh and want to tear him to pieces. Thrall throughout WoD finds it difficult to control the elements because they aren't familiar with him and he's perceived as an outsider (obviously). It's pretty obvious the elements were waiting to pounce on the opportunity to jump on Garrosh if given the command by somebody like Thrall, and they did.</div></div><hr />

Because he's the one who created him, so he was the one who took him down. It shouldn't be hard to understand.<br />
I think the reason they used that music, was to show Thralls rage and disappointment. Thrall is an Orc after all. There may be more to it, but I need the cinematic to settle in my brain.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I actually think they should have cut that quick exchange and just focused on Thrall raising him higher from the ground and wrecking him horrifically. Thrall had to really be a conduit for vengeance here, I would have liked it if he got even dirtier and gruesome killing Garrosh, and Garrosh more sympathetic.<br />

It's pretty obvious the elements were waiting to pounce on the opportunity to jump on Garrosh if given the command by somebody like Thrall, and they did.<br />
and he did was the best for the HORDE. just because of plot ridden naivete of trolls and taurens, it does not make his actions any less beneficial. thrall thing wanted him to rule the horde with the strength and he did it perfectly. but he left, there was no thrall dealing with trolls or tauren when he was needed. stupid people understand stoopid in W - or at least it looks like. he went traveling like a stray dog he is. Garrosh merely points to him that all that he has done was necessary, position, times, circumstances. he has handled it the best he could. if not for him, who knows either thrall would stop being a pansy shite or horde would fall alltogether, stomped under alliance boots.<br />
<br />
and yes it matters. cheating is cheating. now I wish that Garrosh had magic of his own to smack that bitch around with its earthen fist</div></div><hr />

The thing is by the time this duel happens Thrall has come to terms that Garrosh is the one brought about this Iron Horde, through his own dreams and hands, that Thrall himself isn't responsible for what Garrosh chose to do. <br />

That's funny considering the Horde came into existence without the Darkspear Trolls and Tauren. That's also funny considering that the Orcs saved the Darkspear and Tauren from certain death. That's really funny considering the Orcs were surviving just fine without them.</div></div><hr />

Christ dude, put away your Garrosh boner before you poke someone's eye out. And no he didn't care about them at all. See, at the beginning of Cata I liked Garrosh, he showed honor (ie. Stonetalon; killing the orc for killing innocents and druid children) yet fast forward to Warcrimes and we see him going on about how he would enjoy murdering infants. Wow, such honor, very proud, much orc.)<br />
<br />
Plus he resorted to using sha/old god corruption corruption/powers, talk about dishonorable, heck that almost just as bad as drinking the green demon cool aid, maybe worse.</div></div><hr />

His statement may be over the top; however, the post he was responding to (yours) is just flat out wrong. The whole &quot;Horde is a family, the Orcs need the Trolls and Tauren&quot; has been debunked, and (The way you worded it) conveniently ignores timelines.<br />

And no he didn't care about them at all. See, at the beginning of Cata I liked Garrosh, he showed honor (ie. Stonetalon; killing the orc for killing innocents and druid children) yet fast forward to Warcrimes and we see him going on about how he would enjoy murdering infants. Wow, such honor, very proud, muchorc.<br />
if they were to happen be tauren or troll eyes, then I do not mind. I can make zul'jin out of them all swinesnorts. He did. Stonetalon was the beginning of his career, he was still naive. but he never spoke about honour but 'murder'. later he has realised that to save the horde he must obliterate the scum of azeroth. infants or not, they would become enemies of the horde. this is the point where he understood that wrong was saurfang and how weak he was for giving him half assed lessons about morality and paths to choose. honour changes from culture to culture. Garrosh Hellscream is honour itself</div></div><hr />

Not once did I say the need the other races. I just said without them there is no horde, or at least not Thrall's new horde. Probably why Garrosh called it the True horde and not just &quot;The horde&quot; as his True horde referred to a power controlled, ruled and made up of only his nazi orcs where as &quot;The horde&quot; immediately brings to mind Thrall's horde of this band of different races working together.<br />

From a psychopathic, baby murdering, world conquering genocidal nazi-orc point of view, I guess you are right. But from Normal people (and normal orcs) point of view, not so much. <br />
<br />
Power corrupts; Absolute power corrupts Absolutely. Garrosh IS warcrafts Hitler/Stalin. Seriously, alliance = allies, orcs = Aryan germans, The horde = Germany, Garrosh = hitler.......<br />

<br />
<br />
No he did what was best for the ORCS. The horde is a family of all these races, banding together in brotherhooid to survive. Without them there is no horde. garrosh didn't care a rats ass about the horde as a whole, just the orcs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not once did I say the need the other races. <br />
<br />
No, you didn't literally say so; however, when you made the statement &quot;The Horde is a family of all these races banding together in brotherhood to survive,&quot; you make the implication that the survival of the Orcs depends on the presence of the other races, which effectively translates into &quot;needing&quot; them.<br />
<br />
<br />
or at least not Thrall's new horde. <br />
<br />
That's funny considering the &quot;New Horde&quot; starting when Orgrim Doomhammer began to liberate the Orcish internment camps alongside Thrall, Grom and Drek'thar. Even if you really wanted to make the case that the &quot;New Horde&quot; started with Thrall, you'd still be wrong considering Thrall's Horde officially started in southern Lordaeron far before the Orcs met the Darkspear Trolls or Tauren.<br />
<br />
<br />
Probably why Garrosh called it the True horde and not just &quot;The horde&quot; as his True horde referred to a power controlled, ruled and made up of only his nazi orcs where as &quot;The horde&quot; immediately brings to mind Thrall's horde of this band of different races working together. <br />
<br />
Your opinion on what mental imagery is evoked from a fictitious noun with many interpretations, and iterations has no bearing on this discussion. The &quot;True&quot; Horde was birthed only after the other races bitched and moaned about every decision Garrosh had made.</div></div><hr />

nazis have not invented killing. we have a long tradition of murderinge ach other. what allowed germans to do it better were advancements of XX. century. normal orcs are bloodlust creatures, wanting to crush skulls and drink fluids from spines of defeated enemies. also, I don't see them as socialists either.<br />

Well that is pretty much the faction's official description but it is less the orcs depend on them and more they all depend and work for each other. In sense; a family&quot;The Horde is made up of orcs, forsaken, tauren, trolls, blood elves, and most recently, goblins.

Just because the new horde originally started with orcs makes no difference, it soon grew to encompase those other races and they became a major members within the horde, with as much right to call the horde home as any orc.

and he was right, they were, they are weak. slums? they got their own district with little river, huts and voodoo going on. but they were not fit to be present in the heart of Orgrimmar. it was a good decision and they should have bend like harlots they are. this is what happens when rabid animals don't know their place. rebellion, hah! <br />

<br />
Almost every one of your posts is along the lines of &quot;Hail Garrosh, he was in the right because other races suck and are weak because Garrosh said so! Orcs are cooler.&quot; <br />
<br />
Oh and right, just because some orcs don;t want to gargle the blood of infants and crush the bones of innocent people makes them pussies? Mkay then, let me know what prison is like if you go on with that mind set. <br />

Warchief Vol'jin.<br />
<br />
A Promotional description and a quote from an NPC doesn't override established lore. Vol'jin really didn't have a large hand in &quot;Building&quot; the Horde. Objectively speaking from a perspective outside of the narrative, Vol'jin wasn't the one to sign his people up with the Horde, Vol'jin didn't participate in the Battle of Mt. Hyjal, Vol'jin barely participated in the founding of Durotar itself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just because the new horde originally started with orcs makes no difference, it soon grew to encompase those other races and they became a major members within the horde, with as much right to call the horde home as any orc. <br />
<br />
Quit backpedaling. Your original statement was the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
The horde is a family of all these races, banding together in brotherhooid to survive. Without them there is no horde.<br />
<br />
It's really not a good look to shift positions after your previous one gets debunked.<br />
<br />
And I would really appreciate it if you stopped with the language to make yourself sound better. Words like &quot;normal people&quot; and &quot;baby killer&quot; don't help your argument at all, nor do comparisons to American Racial relations. Discrediting your opponents to language, and linking your demolished argument with something barely related, does nothing to help you here.<br />
<br />
<br />
After you know, he decided the other races were to weak to be in the center of Orgrimmar then confined the trolls to slums. And they had right to bitch, they were bad decisions. <br />
<br />
Confined to the slums? How terrible, I mean, it's not like Darkspears have a home of their own. It's not like any Darkspear were making death threats or showing signs of political dissent.<br />
<br />
As far as &quot;Bad decisions&quot; go, I don't think you fully understand the situation. Thrall had settled his people into the deserts of Durotar. The Orcs were barely surviving. Thrall and others (Like Gorgonna) viewed this as an act of penance (Fun Fact: Gorgonna even used the term &quot;Suffering&quot; to describe the situation of the Orcs). To even keep their population fed and housed, the Orcs relied on foreign imports from the Night Elves, with whom they had a rocky relationship. Following the events of the Wrath Gate, the Night Elves cut off trade in response (Even though the &quot;Horde&quot; itself wasn't responsible, much less the Orcs). Diplomatic attempts to reestablish negotiations had proven to be a failure (Thanks to the Twilight's Hammer Clan). So Garrosh went to war to secure the resources his people needed to survive. <br />
<br />
But, oh no, that's a bad decision.</div></div><hr />

counter argument? to what? to what horde is? history remembers more orcish hordes than not. about sports and white people? well, with time people discovered that some negroidal races have better suited physiology for sports. about description of the horde?

<br />
power? The orcs were broken like dogs in the camps, lethargic, downtrodden, void of any hope. Even after the orcs were liberated &quot; It was difficult to rouse the orcs from their lethargy, but Thrall was able to prove to them that their destiny was not yet at its end&quot; Heck, for all we know, maybe Genn's nagging would finally have gotten to the rest of the monarchs and they would have executed a large portion of the orcish race. We may never know. <br />
<br />
One of the reasons Thrall managed to get out I believe was he was raised by humans, so he wasn't as dumb as your standard orc xD<br />
<br />

I'm sure there's some ridiculous reason, that they'll use to justify it (If they justify it, they may just ignore it). If I were a gambling man, my money would be that the 100v100 format was deemed too stressful on late '90s computers. At the end of the day, I'm not surprised they did so, not because they have good reasoning, but because they've established a pattern of letting people down recently.<br />

Unfortunately the Cinematic was shot before WoD changes went through.<br />
<br />
On the melee v. Caster bit though, Arthas did kill Antonidas (A mage). Grom did kill Cenarius (A Druid). <br />
<br />
We do know now that in terms of martial prowess, Garrosh wins. Thrall had to resort to Shaman Shenanigans.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thrall lost in terms of martial prowess yup, but casters are op in lore, he probably tried to beat him without using magic first, but when he chose to use magic he literally oneshot him xD. Garrosh looked a lot taller than Thrall, or did I missee that? Also Thrall totally screwed up when he looked at the axe and didn't see the punch coming lol :D</div></div><hr />

And why does Maraad get to keep divine sacrifice while the rest of us pallys lost it? Lame.<br />
<br />
And I'm slowly coming around to Khadgar's new model in the cinematic, it's actually pretty slick. Granted I miss the old man look since, well, that's what he's supposed to look like, but still not bad. It's like a naturally aged Khadgar as that's probably what he would've looked like had Medivh not cursed him and he aged naturally.<br />
<br />
Garrosh also brings up a decent point despite Thrall's denials; he DID fail Garrosh, and he DID play a role in shaping who he became. Heck even his whole FL &quot;put me back together&quot; crap kinda demonstrated that. Garrosh also has a pretty thick jaw to take all those strikes to the head with the Doomhammer like that.</div></div><hr />

Fel-Infused =/= Demon. At the end of the day, he was still a warrior. The Scourge's version of Death Knights are also largely melee, as opposed to the Old Horde's Death Knights who were largely casters.</div></div><hr />

I see. Myself and others who may share my view are &quot;haters&quot; for having a different opinion from yours.<br />
<br />
It is true that Garrosh chose to perpetrate all those atrocities. That is not in dispute. However, there is some truth to Garrosh's words. And if I have to spell that out for you, then I'm not sure there is any point in continuing this discussion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow... Thrall in the Nagrand one, the &quot;Noo... You choose your own destiny...&quot;... The emotion in that line was amazing. I know I have seen several people going &quot;Thrall took no responsibility&quot; and it makes me wonder if they even watched the video. Just because its not said in words does not mean its not said. The emotion you could hear in Thralls voice says it all. Its better than a stupid monolog of &quot;I failed, I was a failure, I suck, sorry guys.&quot;. It had weight to it, it was the truth but at the same time you could tell Thrall felt regret and disappointment pretty hard.<br />
I did watch the video, actually, and my statement still stands. Yes, I could hear the slight regret and sadness in Thrall's voice, but that was it. Nothing more. Now of course I wouldn't want a &quot;piss and moan&quot; monologue, but at the same time I believe that Blizzard could have done more here.</div></div><hr />

Grom doesn't look that bulky, lol. He's still big. I mean if you want big look at fucking Blackhand.<br />
<br />
I'd say Grom still has a fairly lean physique considering in the cinematic he dodged a bunch of green demon bolts, launched an iron star by himself and then managed to chase the thing down as it was rolling, jump up in the air and slaughter Mannororth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Some people find the journey diminished if they know details about the destination.<br />
<br />
<br />
For example, MoP, knowing Garrosh was going to be the big bad turned all the &quot;will they do anything about this&quot; potential of 5.1 and 5.2's slowly deteriorating faith in the Horde's unity into a game of Spot the Foreshadowing. They'd never had a faction leader become a raid boss before, so many would have been in two minds about the idea of Garrosh actually becoming a raid boss. Instead, due to knowing ahead of time, the story became more of a slog through predictable events than a journey of exploration with an unknown destination to a lot of people.<br />
<br />
Then there have been TV shows where the ads for the next episode reveal &quot;one of X number of characters will die&quot;, turning what is usually portrayed as something that's meant to be a shocking reveal toward the end of the episode into an exercise in trying to guess which one it will be before it happens. I saw one particular show where most of the plot was wrapped up in a neat bow before a sniper shot one of the characters through the head moments before the credits. That would have been totally out of left field, considering the 'good guys are untouchable' trope that a lot of shows hang on to, if I hadn't known someone was going to die. Instead of the burst of emotion and shock at the event, all I thought was &quot;boy, they are running out of time for- oh, it was her&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't meant to be targeted specifically at you, but at the phrase; I hate when people use the &quot;it's the journey, not the destination&quot; argument. Perhaps it is to them, but it doesn't apply to everyone. It's like being told that you should watch a show you've tried and dislike because &quot;it's good&quot;.</div></div><hr />

1.You don't seem to get that in part it is Thrall's fault. He made him warchief when he told him he wasn't ready.<br />
2. He was part time warchief while thrall was saving the world and then he left garrosh in charge to be a dad because yes.<br />
3. You can obviously see Garrosh's daddy issues with thrall being his role model and doing the exact same thing Grom did with him.<br />
4. Everyone in our horde treaded him like shit for no reason, he was hot headed yes but never respected among his peers.<br />
<br />
Garrosh is half right on it whether you like it or not.</div></div><hr />

Just remember that not everyone can be a shaman, and being able to call the elements makes you a powerful person already.<br />
Besides, if you think Thrall is weak physically, you never read Lord of the Clans... he endured a lot on Blackmoore's Arena, and even won a 1v1 duel against Orgrim. Yes, Orgrim was already &quot;old&quot;, but he was always described as being a huge and very strong orc, with great spirit (the humans couldn't prevent his escape from LORDAERON'S CAPITAL CITY, right under Terenas' nose, when they thought he was demoralized). I'm honestly surprised with Thrall being beaten so badly by QQrrosh, who, on the other hand, was just another QQ orc in Nagrand, and suddenly he is a super bad ass, powerful HELLSCREAM.<br />
<br />
Even Cairne was having the upper hand in his duel against Garrosh, he won only because of a coward's poison... and Cairne's &quot;bones were aching&quot; due to old age hehe.<br />
Garrosh is just a crying baby, Thrall united the orcs when they were just dogs in the human encampments, taught them the old shamanistic ways, and is a natural leader, being respected even by the dragon aspects. A pity blizzard overused him.<br />
All that being said, Thrall is not my favorite lore character, but you have to consider the facts and admit that Garrosh is trash compared to Thrall.</div></div><hr />

Garrosh is just a crying baby, Thrall united the orcs when they were just dogs in the human encampments, taught them the old shamanistic ways, and is a natural leader, being respected even by the dragon aspects. A pity blizzard overused him.<br />
All that being said, Thrall is not my favorite lore character, but you have to consider the facts and admit that Garrosh is trash compared to Thrall.<br />
<br />
Well said, well said indeed<br />

<br />
It seems like a design choice to make him feel less of a 'shamanistic elder / leader' and more of a warrior again. I think it's very appropriate and fits his new role in the Horde well.</div></div><hr />

I remember the wrath gate and all the others and these are just incredible. The Nagrand and Dark Portal Out in specific were my favorites. Seeing the Warlord's like that is pretty neat and gives me hope that Blizz has found a good balance of when the baddies show up, a lot like the Lich King. <br />
<br />
Nagrand was amazing as well, I could change a few minor things, but overall it was very well done. It is a fitting end to an arc that needed a good ending, and I am happy with it. <br />
<br />
all things considered these all get a 9/10. Well done Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Edit: The more I watch that Nagrand cutscene the more feels I feel. So sad. It makes me really understand Garrosh's character a lot more and really actually like him. Just a little late though.</div></div><hr />

That's also funny considering that the Orcs saved the Darkspear and Tauren from certain death. That's really funny considering the Orcs were surviving just fine without them.<br />
<br />
They were NEVER by themselves. You may not remember, but they allied with the OGRES (which, later, provided them with some Ogre-Magi) and with Zul'Jin and the forest trolls. They even got pumped with demon's blood. And had dragons.<br />
<br />
This is a new era. Without the other races of the horde, they would've already been crushed by the alliance.<br />
Did you play Warcraft III:The Frozen Throne? When Admiral Daelin Proudmoore and his Kul Tiras were leading an assault against Thrall and the orcs during the founding of Durotar, he had to turn to Cairne for his wisdom and assistance. With the tauren's help (and Rexxar's and Jaina's), they pushed the humans back. Who knows what would have happened if the taurens weren't there...<br />
<br />
The Horde came into existence without the other races, and that didn't achieve much.<br />
<br />
BTW, my faction is The Horde...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's sad that in that particular cinematic... I have to agree with Garrosh. Not all the way, and he does sound like he's making excuses, but damn... he was thrust into a position he wasn't ready for. I love the voice acting, when he just breaks down while accusing Thrall of leaving him to pick up the pieces.<br />
<br />
The rest of the cinematics I thought were really neat (Blackhand running from an explosion obviously means he's an action hero now), but that one just gives me mixed feelings. On the one hand, it's quite a satisfying end and it finally brought to light the monumental scale of Thrall's mistake. On the other... there is some remorse, but I would at least have liked Thrall to appologise to Garrosh before the end. Something more than him being a self-righteous arse. :/</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">conmanW</div><div class="date">2014-09-20, 05:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">.....The nagrand cinematic.....changed everything about what I thought of Garrosh.....how he came to be the monster he did.....<br />
He was lost. A lost child, stuck without his father. without his guidance. without help, left to care for the home he was left behind.....He was lost. He snapped.<br />
Cairne did have some respect for Garrosh as a warrior, but thought him a brute and unable to lead, despite the mercy he showed to alliance crew members after attacking a ship of theirs, by letting them go with but a warning:stay away from Horde trade routes. He asked for help, and he was denied.<br />
....Cairne's death changed him....The last one left by Thrall, the true father figure of his life, was Vol'jin, who spat in his face and left him behind....<br />
..He gained guidance in Stonetalon, but only for a short time. His only other mentor was still stuck in Northrend, to pick up the scraps.<br />
After the assault on the Highlands, he lost his last advisor to the Cult.<br />
He was lost. He didn't know what to do....He looked to all he had left to for instruction on how to lead: the Past. <br />
He looked to Grom, the one who's shadow he tried to escape. He always wondered &quot;Would my father be proud?&quot; <br />
Thrall..his true father figure....already had told Garrosh how he felt:<br />
&quot;You dissapoint me, Garrosh.&quot; <br />
He looked to the past because he did not know how Grommash would feel about his actions. He had no fellow leaders to stop him from his path as he began down it, but it was to late to stop him when they tried. The immediate spoils were to tempting, to fertile to not see this path of destruction as the correct one. The leaders who had lived through to see the consequences of the Horde's past conquests were all long dead. Those who had lead before him denied him when they needed him most. Vol'jin. Cairne. Thrall. <br />
&quot;You made me what i am!&quot;<br />
He went down the path himself....but giving someone the ultimate power and not telling them what to do with a whole nation hurting from war, is like giving your small son the whole house, telling him you are leaving forever. It is now his. <br />
He won't know what to do...and then....<br />
The tears will run.<br />
Destruction will come.<br />
And all will blame the one left without guidance, the one with the ultimate power, the one who they left behind to figure out all himself. Without recognizing that they led him down this very path by not giving him the help he needs.<br />
Garrosh denied his crimes not because he was proud of them....but because he thought he did what was right. He followed the footsteps laid before him. <br />
If Garrosh had been guided by Thrall, Cairne or even Vol'jin, he could have been great....the Greatest even....instead he became a tyrant lost to despair without the guidance he needed from the one he saw as a father, who has now killed him to rectify the mistake he made, not of making him warchief, but the one of leaving him behind....﻿<br />
<br />
I'm sorry for my long post if it at all seems rambally (?)...but it just...caused an emotional response from me i never saw coming. I'm truly sad that Garrosh will not get a redemption story....I truly am.....He could have great....if he was redeemed, he could finally receive the guidance he needed, nay deserved, as he finally confronted the father that left him behind to pick up the scraps of a great people, not as the sick young boy in Nagrand....but the one who found him there, and left him behind as Warchief</div></div><hr />

<br />
If anything, Thrall knows exactly that he (among other people) made Garrosh what he was. At least if the echoed sentiment from the ending of Lord of the Clans rubbed off on him. There, Blackmoore says he is proud to have made Thrall what he was. Thrall later speaks with Drek'thar who tells him everyone he ever met shaped him.</div></div><hr />

The orcs were broken like dogs in the camps, lethargic, downtrodden, void of any hope. Even after the orcs were liberated &quot; It was difficult to rouse the orcs from their lethargy, but Thrall was able to prove to them that their destiny was not yet at its end&quot; Heck, for all we know, maybe Genn's nagging would finally have gotten to the rest of the monarchs and they would have executed a large portion of the orcish race. We may never know. <br />
<br />
One of the reasons Thrall managed to get out I believe was he was raised by humans, so he wasn't as dumb as your standard orc xD<br />
<br />
I get it you like orcs, but sometime you just need to take a step back from your keyboard and realize they aren't the most invincible power house in the warcraft universe that can get out of any sticky situation xD<br />
lies, lies, lies, lies! they wre simply conserving their power! standby!<br />
in fact, this whole lore is ridiculous. these monarchs should have been executing orcs on the spot but noo, build camps, feed them, keep potential threat alive. <br />
<br />
they are! orcs beat everything! it may not be the sam euniverse but this quote is universal!<br />
<br />
Orkses is never defeated in battle. If we win we win, if we die we die fighting so it don't count. If we runs for it we don't die neither, cos we can come back for annuver go, see!</div></div><hr />

He acted like a regular conqueror, nothing wrong about it. War mongering? Is it suprising, his title was 'WAR-chief', not peace-piss.<br />
