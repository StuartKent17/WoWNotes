Given the relatively limited supply of tickets - 25,000 out of probably as much as 1M requests (maybe more) the odds are heavily against you. I'm fortunate to have gone the last 3 years - last year I had a friend get in and I bought an extra ticket. This year, I got nothing.</div></div><hr />

I didn't waste any time filling any information in. I just put my name and email on the tickets since you can always change that information later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah. It always seems like the same people get them every year, and it seems weird that certain well-known community types always manage to get them. (I'm not talking about people who get media passes, I mean general tickets). I'm not saying there's a conspiracy, but there is something weird about it. <br />
<br />
I kind of think there should be a new fairer system, though I have no idea what that would be. <br />
<br />
(ftr I've never tried buying Blizzcon tickets and probably never will, I have no dog in the fight either way)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are kinda right.<br />
<br />
You get your guild, and their spouses, and parents, and siblings to get on.<br />
<br />
I am now on year 6 of getting tickets, from as few 4 one year to as many as 22 another. Every year we have gotten the number we have needed. But it does not come without effort. <br />
<br />
This year we had 9 people online on day one, 4 got tickets to get us what we thought was the 16 we needed. A few other friends wanted more, so we got another 4 today, with again 9 people trying to get tickets.. but only one of the 9 actually made it. If we had failed on day one, would have been more people online Saturday for it. This was probably the fewest people we had ever used. <br />
<br />
Some years we have had as many as 20ish people online trying to get tickets. It also helps having a crew that is on different internet across the country it seems...as there have been years where one pocket vs another has been more &quot;lucky&quot;. <br />
<br />
There is a certain element of random chance too, but like with loot -- more chances increase your click luck. If you really want to go next year, talk to everyone on your inner circle of family and friends weeks ahead of time, inform them how important their help would be and the dates, help them get set up and give instructions, and then be ready for the days. <br />
<br />
Also, watch the ebay ticket pricing, they will drop -- alot. As the last days to transfer the tickets come, there will be those needing to shed extra tickets. Also if you live in SoCal, show up on the day before and even morning of the con. There are a good deal of people looking to shed an extra ticket because someone missed a flight or could not come last minute...and usually at face value -- maybe minus the loot box. <br />
<br />
I don't mean this to be cocky -- more so to hopefully help some hunters next year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
u can filter only sold listings, several have sold already... the real catch is last year and again this year.. the original buyer can change the email on the ticket BUT the ticket stays in their uverse account essentially allowing them to sell it again. It happened to several people in a con group i was in last year. There was also a guy arrested at con last year for selling fake badges.. sold like 40+ before he was caught.. sadly all the folks that bought the badges and were seen with them got booted from con also.</div></div><hr />
