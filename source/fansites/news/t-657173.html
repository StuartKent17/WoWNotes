Doesn't know the facts. I've just downloaded it, being a owner of an iPhone and it's pretty good tbh.<br />
Not exactly going to be the most used thing personally compared to all the other crap I have on it, but it's free and will be fun to use on bus journeys or trips away etc.</div></div><hr />

U can use it as a Standart Armory Application to find Chars, but the app can more! Ingame Calender Events will show up when u login, u have a Newsreader, manage u Charackter, Talentplaner and so on.<br />
<br />
Great Job!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has advantages. A cleaner interface and designed to work with the iPhone, as opposed to the website that's used to work with...well, computers.<br />
<br />
The idea of being able to check in-game calendars on the go and accept or decline raids when just bored...well, it's not a bad feature at all. <br />
<br />
Best part of it is that it's light-weight, too. I think it was less than 10mb to download.</div></div><hr />

<br />
After loading my account up, I now realize that if I ever were to need to armory someone /something from now on, I'm going to be using my phone regardless whether I have a computer in front of me or not.<br />
<br />
The interface is well designed and very, VERY easy to use. Everything loads up lightning fast, and the sound effects played during the video are actual sound effects from the app. So turning on sound definately makes it that much cooler.<br />
<br />
Shows enchants, gems, everything you could possibly want to know, at the touch of a finger. <br />

So you are playing on Kargath alliance-side, and your buddy who plays on Mal'Ganis horde side logs in, it lets you know.<br />
<br />
Then if you want to go even further, you can have a status indicator for your friends tracked globally on some app. It tells you where they are, if they are grouped or in a raid or BG, if they are engaged in battle, notifies you when they die or wipe, notifies you when they exit combat, what mobs died and what loot dropped and who won said loot. Something that allows you to &quot;follow along&quot; with the essential details of what your friends are doing, without having to actually have WoW running on your mobile device nor requiring streaming video.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Update: The iPhone app works great. Definitely faster and more user friendly than the website. Kinda sad the website is that bad. I can browse my chars just fine on my phone, but nothing will load on a browser. gg</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lateralus</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 07:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">just downloaded it. seems faster than armory, limited use maybe but at least it will kill some time on the commute ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rootntootn</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The actual name of the app is World of Warcraft Mobile Armory, for you people having trouble finding it.<br />
<br />
As for the actual use of this app, I personally probably won't open it up again since I have no real interest in the armory, but just out of curiosity I did download it and play around with it for about 30 minutes. It's everything I'd expect from a blizzard product. Well designed, very functional, and does just about everything you can do on the armory itself. Overall it's an awsome App if you like these kind of things.<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the people complaining about IPhone and how expensive they are, they aren't as bad you everyone thinks, I paid the same amount for my IPhone that I did for my old phone 5 years ago.. with a contract they only run around 200 bucks(PS, the razor cost this when it first came out with a contract as well) so price isn't REALLY an issue if you are signing a new contract AND/OR eligible for an upgrade via AT&amp;T. The funny thing is I get &quot;I would never pay that much for a phone&quot; all the time and &quot;I only use my phone to talk and text&quot;. Well, I only used my old phone for the same reason before because well.... that's all they could do. Now I use my phone for a TON of things because well... it can do all kinds of neat things now. <br />
<br />
Back to the app though... <br />
is it neat? yes<br />
is it really useful? not really<br />
Would I rather they spend their resources on other things other than apps for the IPhone? heck yes....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: It's a free app, so blizz hasn't made a dime so far.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Noktus</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 07:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Downloaded it off my 3g so its less than 10MB. Really fast and easy to use, lot better than the armoury on their website.<br />
<br />
Can do a lot with it, search for upgrades, check out your chars, guild chars, any char really.<br />
<br />
Granted its of limited use and its free (for the time being) so why not, its a good little app that works well.<br />
<br />
If it stays free then kudos but tbh I think it wont be free forever.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hey guiyz, go buy an iPhone so you can view your armory on the bus!&quot;<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoca371db5304</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 08:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The fact that the iPhone/iTouch armory is faster than the browser variant is not all that surprising really when you think about it.<br />
<br />
When you browse armory on your computer browser; the armory constantly has to send you detailed information on how the page should look like, and how to handle character information (how to display it), whilst finally receiving the actual character data of course. Theres also a lot more 'misc' stuff on each page as well. This is all done in Adobe Flash too, remember.<br />
<br />
The iPhone app skips all of the above except for the actual character data - and that data is nothing more than plain text; very compact and easy to transfer.<br />
<br />
A 'regular' armory page probably requires a few hundred kilobytes per page - an iPhone armory page requires perhaps 5-10 kb.<br />
<br />
The fact that the client comes preloaded with all of the essentials, images, etc is also an important besides for being convenient and fast. Many carriers still charge based on the amount of data transfered - reducing the data transfered drastically increases the usability of the service.<br />
<br />
Of course - this also means that the servers are less strained by each request, so they in turn are able to complete each request made by an iPhone much faster and the chance of getting stuck mid-loading is as such greatly reduced.</div></div><hr />

A lot of increased usability when comparing to the free alternatives. Also this app replaces several of my others. On top it's much faster, better ui and it's FREE! Everyone keeps saying Blizzard is greedy, but both this app and the mobile authenticator are free! On top it's much faster than the regular armory, as stated by others previously.<br />
<br />
A lot of people in this thread are saying they wouldn't use it. But I'll bet most of the people saying it don't even have an iPhone. The iPhone is all about gimmicks and having direct access to everything while you're on the go. This fits very nicely amongst any avid wow+iphone fans app collection.<br />
<br />
Blizzard please keep up the great work, some of us really appreciate what you're doing! *:)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you have to look at it in terms of the clientele WoW attracts.<br />
<br />
1. WoW has very outdated graphics. It runs on low-end computers. These computers may cost $400 now or even less. Basically the poorest computer owners have access to WoW.<br />
2. $15 a month as a monthly fee is cheap entertainment, again targeting people with less income.<br />
<br />
Its possible that the people who play WoW are less likely to be able to afford a $200 phone than the average customer. I wouldn't be surprised if more WoW players are on some $40 phone with a pay-as-you-go plan than average.</div></div><hr />

That can work both ways. I can go buy COD4 for slightly more; but not have to pay to play it for the coming 2 years. MMOs usually tend to get gamers who are doing slightly better economically.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hey guiyz, go buy an iPhone so you can view your armory on the bus!&quot;<br />
<br />
yeah k, nty.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, heaven forbid Blizzard actively market their game by linking it to one of the most successful must-have brands of recent decades in order to keep subscriber levels high- what a ridiculous business model that is. Much better just to never promote WOW anywhere, ever, right?<br />
<br />
Back on topic and skipping the now-inevitable whining that accompanies any post on any wow-related board, I just downloaded this app and I have to say it's excellent. I'll be interested to see whether this app highlights where the instability issues stem from. At the moment the Armory on the web is frequently down, but we don't know whether that's a web server issue or an Armory database issue. I'd be interested to see whether the iPhone app is capable of retrieving data when the website is down- I suspect it might do so in at least some of the cases.<br />
<br />
As far as the functionality is concerned, it's really quite excellent. The layout is really intelligent and centered around you getting information out of it as quickly as possible. The performance is snappy (although I'm on a 3G S- it might be slower on older iPhones), it retrieves data far quicker than the web version, and the interface is structured largely around your character(s), so for leaderboards it automatically defaults to your guild/server. I like the fact that there are buttons on the interface to jump straight to your characters, or to your guild roster, or to Server news (i.e. announcements of new realm first achievements etc), rather than having to search for them first or click through any links.<br />
<br />
My only slight criticism is that you log in by region, so when you search for characters I believe it only returns EU records (in my case). Would have been useful to have some sort of database selection option, so that you could search the US database from the app as well. Other than that, although it's not life-changing, it's certainly useful, and since my iPhone is usually plugged into my computer next to me while I'm playing WOW, it'll be a lot easier to just search it on my phone rather than using the web version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You log in like you would the game and you can then browse all your characters just like the armory. This includes talents/glyphs/pvp etc. the level of blizzard polish is evident - the graphics are pin sharp and the item tooltips pop up extremely fast<br />
There is a fully functioning talent calculator and you can also browse your guild. In fact you can search for and inspect anyone anywhere. You can even see your guild calendar<br />
The item browser is particularly good - it allows you to browse all the instance items from deadmines to ulduar<br />
Also included is the general blizzard news feed from the website, so there's even stuff to read<br />
<br />
Basically you can do everything except play the game itself :)<br />
<br />
If anyone can think of a better free application to while away bored hours while commuting or whatever id like to know. Personally, it put a big grin on my face</div></div><hr />

Yes it is free but Blizz will earn mony off this, when for example you are busy on armory on school and one off your friends sees it and asks you &quot;What is that?&quot; and you start explaining what WoW is. It is free marketting they put out in the world.<br />

Yes, of course, but you've missed the point. The piont is, making noise about it. The best way to make noise is to have something related to PiceOfHardwareThatOwnsYou and TheBestCompanyInTheWorld that produces mentioned piece of hardware. Mind you, they've sold about 37 millioni of PiceOfHardwareThatOwnsYou and PiceOfHardwareThatOwnsYouTouch. Compared to those 37 million users, who would care about mobile version, accessible to mere hundreds of million? ;D</div></div><hr />

Don't forget that it works on an iPod touch too (wifi connected ofc) so that probably covers about half of the 11 million<br />

Actually, with Bolt Browser, I can view the Armory on my BlackBerry almost the same as anyone can on their desktop. I would just prefer a platform specific application, as it would potentially have lower load times and less data usage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So many people have already pointed out that it wasn't necessary since you can view the armory from the internet, but iPhone users need to ask themselves, &quot;How many ridiculous apps have I downloaded/installed that I really didn't need?&quot; This falls under that category but I find that its way cooler than the average frivolous download.<br />

Yet for the rest of us it updates when we log out.</div></div><hr />

What iPhone lacks in hardware it makes up for in spades with software. Of course you have to wade through a cesspool of garbageware but there is way more quality software available for the iPhone than any other mobile phone has ever had, including Palm.</div></div><hr />

I looked into selecting my main but cant find the option for this. The other two things are its not fetching my duel spec talents or Glyphs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Go to the list of all of your characters, click the Edit button at the top and then select who you want to be your main character. They should have a Crown icon to the left of their name once selected (and a little thing will pop up). <br />
<br />
I think that aspect is poorly done and you should be allowed to hide characters. Like I don't want to show my very low level bank alts and stuff.<br />

Not for Blackberry or Windows Mobile. Blizzard fail more and more.<br />
<br />
<br />
I believe Blizzard remarked that they want to develop more for Windows Mobile when asked in regard of the Battle.Net Mobile Authenticator. Chances are they would want to do the same with this. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This is all done in Adobe Flash too, remember.<br />
<br />
I don't recall any Flash being used on the Armory... I'm pretty sure the functionality is controlled using AJAX.</div></div><hr />

It works great, much better than website.<br />

The armory web site is not their domain, so instead they add a streamlined interface to the same database that the armory uses via the iPhone.</div></div><hr />

lol no, there is quite the difference between someone who plays the game and someone who can't be away from the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, I use my phone for calling people xD<br />
<br />
<br />
Because iPhone is so much more expensive than the rest in its class... oh wait... it's exactly the same price point! Not to mention you can get one for $99.<br />
<br />
Nice trolling attempt thought ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What's your point? You can have it in a nice, iPhone friendly app, for free, or you can have it in a browser window where you have to zoom in-and-out because most of the website is designed for a landscape, higher resolution view. <br />
<br />
I don't see why people complain. Don't want it? Fine, don't get it. <br />
<br />
I am fairly certain almost everyone who bitches about it don't even own an iPhone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nebiru</div><div class="date">2009-07-17, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Downloaded it as soon as I discovered it, played around with it a little bit and I'm convinced that I'll be using it, it allows access to the in-game calendar so I can check personal/guild-events and such which will probably be the feature that I use the most, also it's an instant update and a hell of a lot quicker than the actual armory, so I can imagine that I'll be looking in my phone for updated profiles right away while at the pc instead of bothering to tab into the web-browser armory.<br />
<br />
It also has a talent calculator, general news about the game and all the realm-first achievements, a complete item database, you can bookmark whatever you want so you can be at a page you're likely to visit alot in literally 3 clicks with your finger, all accessible via the 3G network<br />
<br />
are all these features necessary? no, but keep in mind that its an iphone/touch application, it doesnt have to be necessary to be a fun time<br />
<br />
edit: <br />
Just to try it I logged on to wow, created a custom calendar event and unequipped a gearpiece, checked the armory in my browser and nothing had changed, checked it in my iphone and it was updated, awesome idea and execution blizz<br />
<br />
People that say &quot;uuuhhh /nerdrage you can just check all this at your compuuteeer why do you need an application for iphone thats shit anywaay uuuhh&quot; are clearly people who dont even own an iphone and havent even tried the app out, who most likely sit by their pc all day (hence why they have access to armory 24/7 and no need for an app like this) and arent moving around, for an active person thats not always by the pc but still likes to stay updated on his favorite game (like meeeee) this app is great<br />
<br />
besides this app eliminates the need for the armory because its better than the browser version</div></div><hr />

Exactly the same price point? Orly?<br />
Iphone 8GB - 589 Euro (amazon.de)<br />
Iphone 16Gb - 726 Euro (amazon.de)<br />
Samsung Omnia (S8000) - 365 Euro (amazon.de)<br />
<br />
Samsung has:<br />
No FUCKING iJobbs bundling.<br />
MOLED screen.<br />
Expandable micro-SD slot<br />
Needs no jailbreak.<br />
Oh, and Jobbs cannot stop you from using any browser you want on it, Opera, couph...<br />
<br />
So, STFU, ok? Thanks...</div></div><hr />
