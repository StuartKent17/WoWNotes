With M'uru out of the picture, we're left with 5 weapons from the old and always-reliable sunwell loot leak (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/january/sunwell_loots.jpg).

Official Forum Reorganization<br />
On Wednesday, May 21, we’ll be making some changes to the way the forums are organized. While the majority of these changes only alter how the current forums are grouped together, we will be removing the Guild Recruitment forum entirely, and replacing it with new Guild Recruitment – Alliance, and Guild Recruitment – Horde forums. By splitting the forum we’re effectively cutting the posting traffic of the forum in half which will help keep the recruitment posts there visible for a longer amount of time before falling off the first page. When this change happens all posts currently in the Guild Recruitment forum will be removed, so if you or your guild currently have a recruitment post there please keep a copy to repost after the split.<br />
<br />
We don’t anticipate these changes to cause any issues for posters while we make them, but some forum navigation options may only be partially functional until we’ve completed the work.<br />

Yeah, this rule seems pretty stupid to me. It goes against one of the absolute best features of WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well they want the games to be about how 'good' the player is at the game not about how well the add-on plays parts of the game for them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is the looks of that staff really the best they could come up with for the best healing weapon ingame, as well as a drop from the Kil'jaeden encounter? :x<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of items are based off items shown in screenshots and concept art. The staff doesn't seem too bad to me. <br />

Aren't addons 2nd party addons? As in ones that Blizz approve of and don't ban for?<br />
3rd party addons sound more like powerleveling software, goldgrind bots and so on.</div></div><hr />

As it appears, it won't need any ammo anymore, right?<br />
The screenie only says &quot;15% attack-speed&quot;. No word about the sfx and the magical arrows-stuff.<br />
<br />
Either way: Hell... I want to have that bow ;D</div></div><hr />
