BlizzCast #11: BlizzCon 2009 in Review<br />
In our eleventh episode of BlizzCast, we have a roundtable discussion with members of the community team to recap the major happenings, announcements, and other highlights of this yearâ€™s BlizzCon. Join our discussion as we relive some of our favorite moments from the show.<br />

Blue posts<br />
New LFG Channel<br />
I don't think a world-wide LFG channel would be something you'd really want. It would immediately become the global chat channel for trade, spam and Chuck Norris jokes.<br />
<br />
On live it's restricted to people using the LFG tool. The new dungeon tool honestly makes matches so quickly under most conditions that that implementation won't work. We feared people would just use the /trade channel if we didn't make a similar /lfg channel. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/20677352474-dont-restrict-lfg-channel-to-cities.html))<br />
<br />
Dungeon system gear requirements<br />
It uses all the items you own to make that determination, not just what you have equipped.<br />
<br />
Honestly though, we are really relaxed about how we use this restriction. It's basically in there to prevent newly minted 80s in quest greens from rolling into a heroic dungeon that is likely to kick their butt. Most players sophisticated enough to be on these boards won't run into it in day to day practice. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/20677672386-lfg-tool-and-dual-spec.html))<br />
<br />
Looking for raid NOT working cross-realms<br />
If a dungeon group falls apart after 1-2 bosses, it's not nearly as big of a deal as if a raid group falls apart after 5 bosses of Ulduar. If the group wants to continue it and somebody from another realm (who can't really contact you easily) beat you to it and cleared it with their friends, that would probably leave you a bit upset. This is just one example that came to me off the top of my head.<br />
<br />
Sure, there could be ways to resolve this with a variety of rules, but we will see how things go for now. A lot of raids are able to happen once people are found so we mainly just want to make it easier to find people for now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677232147-say-no-to-looking-for-raid.html))<br />
<br />
Additional stats in monsters tooltips for Cataclysm<br />
We'd be more likely to just put it on the stats screen as a tooltip for your hit chance for example. To get the information from particular creatures will require a little more work on our part. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />
<br />
Boss difficulty<br />
I'm talking about an Icecrown boss being tougher than an Ulduar boss, not that the Ulduar bosses look at how much gear you have and scale themselves up accordingly.<br />
<br />
Bosses get more damage and health. If they also got more expertise, defense and maybe armor then as character item level grew their relative strength to boss stats would not increase. As it is they increase enormously, requiring the bosses to have even more health and even more damage. Shifting some of that health and damage to other stats would fix a lot of problems. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />
<br />
Giving wands to level 1 characters<br />
As far as wands go, we definitely do not want to give them to casters at level 1. Wands play a very different role for casters than melee weapons do for melee classes. They're generally used as mana conservation DPS. We are removing the Attack button from level 1 casters' action bars specifically so new players aren't inclined to walk around trying to melee foes without learning the way the spells available to them function. Giving them a wand and placing the Shoot icon on the action bar would lead to the same issue for players new to the game rolling casters. They might be inclined to run around using their wands rather than learning their class spells.<br />
<br />
With mana regeneration being greatly improved for the level 1-10 experience in patch 3.3, mana issues should not warrant the use of wands too often when players are getting started. Because of this, we want to make sure new players are focused purely on learning how to use spells to kill enemy targets. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20677352112-why-give-rogues-dw-at-level-1.html))<br />

Chill of the Throne / Tanking (See Chill of the Throne, Tanking, and You! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/chill-of-the-throne-tanking-and-you!/))<br />
Reasons behind the change<br />
I'll address this one more time and then leave it because I think players are more interested in trying to turn this into a huge tanking nerf than understand what's going on.<br />
<br />
We would not have this problem if Icecrown gear had been item level 245 or so, as we originally intended. We added a few extra tiers of gear to support heroic modes. We felt like we had to do that to have different difficulty levels and make raiding more accessible overall. We felt like we had to reward the harder modes with the better gear or nobody would have been very interested.<br />
<br />
The proportions of relative stats on your gear are not the problem. They are proportional, give or take a little, at every tier except for stats like hit that cap out. The problem is not the class and item teams being out of sync. In fact, they are the same team. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />
<br />
Diminishing returns<br />
The 20% nerf is applied after diminishing returns. That is why I am saying it won't affect the relative value of dodge and parry. The Icewell Radiance won't get you closer to diminishing returns by itself.<br />
<br />
The whole point of this change is so bosses can hit less hard but more often, for the same damage over time but with fewer deadly spikes. That should feel better to everyone overall. The reason I am reluctant to say that is because some players are going to go into Icecrown, find it hard, and then expect us to buff their class.<br />
<br />
It won't be Brutallus hard, at least most of the bosses and at least on normal mode. We're not going to be particularly sympathetic to players who find heroic mode too hard. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />
<br />
Stamina less important?<br />
It arguably makes stam less important (though it will always be important for tanks). Many players are probably telling you right now that only stamina and armor are important because if you ever fail to avoid two boss hits in a row that you're going to die. Under that environment, avoidance loses a lot of value.<br />
<br />
If bosses hit for less in IC (which they will, since they will hit more often) then the value of avoidance for purposes of survival increases.<br />
<br />
I still expect many tanks will die in two hits until they get geared up a little. But they will, and then the ability to survive two hits in a row won't be as big an issue. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />
<br />
Effective Health<br />
I am going to attempt to explain the disconnect the community and the developers have over effective health.<br />
<br />
When I first learned to tank, long before I came to Blizzard, I learned that effective health is a measurement of your stamina in relationship to your armor. This is a pretty easy number to generate. It's reasonable to include say shield block and other simple forms of mitigation into the calculation.<br />
<br />
However, you cannot directly translate effective health into best tank. Avoidance matters. If it didn't, we would have no reason to nerf it in Icecrown. Good tanks don't depend too much on avoidance, but great tanks understand its value.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, your estimations of effective health become less and less accurate the more variables you try to factor in. Most saliently, you can't easily account for cooldowns. You can't compare a short duration that reduces damage by 80% to a long duration that reduces damage by 10%. Mathematically they might generate the same effective health number, but in reality they work pretty differently and each has their own benefits in certain situations, which vary depending on boss mechanics. (I'd generally take the first one though.)<br />
<br />
We purposely made the cooldowns difficult to compare from class to class. You shouldn't then be surprised when we take your effective health calculations based on direct comparisons of said cooldowns with a grain of salt.<br />
<br />
It's fine to compare health, armor, avoidance or cooldowns. I would not recommend putting too much faith in one ubernumber that you generate by combining all of them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677232049-tank-eh-being-looked-at-in-33-at-all.html))<br />
<br />
Icecrown isn't Naxxramas<br />
I am pretty sure on day one of 3.3 going live this forum will be filled with tanks who died and respond with &quot;I thought bosses weren't going to hit hard.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's Icecrown. It's not going to be Naxx. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />
<br />
Avoidance relative value<br />
If you conclusion is that anything that improves your avoidance is now bad as a result of this change, you should think through it a little more. If you didn't like avoidance before, nothing changes. If you liked avoidance before, nothing changes. You just have less of it now. The relative value should not change, unless you get to the point where bosses no longer two-shot tanks so much, in which case the relative value of avoidance increases. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />

Chill of the Throne and DK Threat<br />
It's not an oversight. The question is how many times are you prepared to use Rune Strike but can't because you haven't gotten a dodge or parry. If you are replacing most of your white swings with Rune Strikes, then you shouldn't see much of a difference.<br />
<br />
[...] Yeah, per my previous response we are looking at Rune Strike. We're not convinced it will be a problem yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />
<br />
[...] There are a couple of flaws in your argument here. DKs macro Rune Strike not because they suffer for threat, but because more threat is generally better for a tank and there is no real penalty for macroing the ability. Players tend to macro attacks when the macro performs for them, not when they are really, really desperate to use the ability.<br />
<br />
Second, you can't assume that less dodge turns into less Rune Strikes in such a simple manner. You have to look at how many white hits you convert to Rune Strike now and then how many you would convert to Rune Strike after losing dodge. If you have enough of a window in between dodges to still get a Rune Strike off, then you would see no effect. I suspect that's not the case, but I also don't think you'll see your threat plummet.<br />
<br />
We also don't see too many appropriately geared tank of any class having sustained single-target threat problems in cases where you aren't supposed to have threat problems. Yes your dps classes may sometimes get dangerously close to pulling. That is part of the game. We're a long way from when the warlock would crit on a Molten Destroyer and wipe the raid because he didn't wait for 5 Sunders. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20677632379-icewell-radiance-is-in.html))<br />

Retribution in Arena<br />
Ret should be viable in Arena and all aspects of the game. You have to be very careful when you analyze Arena statistics however. If say Shadow priests aren't viable in Arena, then many Shadow priests would rather stop competing than to go Disc. We have found that many paladins will switch specs at the drop of a hat for PvP purposes. You individually may not, but that doesn't prove the trend invalid. So if actual Ret spec paladins are low, you have to ask yourself how many of them are essentially behaving like Ret paladins but going to get a great talent deep in Holy or Prot. How many of them switched to Prot because Prot is too good at healing? You can't just jump to a &quot;buff Ret&quot; solution.

Vanish changes reverted on PTR<br />
It actually wasn't working well on the PTR because some casts that should not have broken it still broke it and it also prevented legitimate stealth breakers from functioning well. We probably could have lived with one of those problems, but with both it didn't seem worth the change. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677632565-about-that-vanish-fix.html))<br />
<br />
Weapon swapping<br />
We think the problems with swapping weapons get overstated a lot. There is some theoretical evidence that you can get a small dps increase by swapping weapons. In reality, many of the rogues who try it find that it's too prone to error given the marginal benefit. If you can make it work, that's great for you, but we don't think that weapon swapping will be the typical way for rogues to max out their dps.<br />
<br />
Now if it got the point where the typical raiding rogue was dependent on swapping weapons, we'd probably do something about it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20677331652-please-kill-rogue-pve-weaponswapping.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now if it got the point where the typical raiding rogue was dependent on swapping weapons, we'd probably do something about it.<br />
<br />
I would say that after the changes of Master Poisoner (assassination), Deadly Poison becomes useless as soon as you have 5 stacks running. This makes weapon swapping ideal for mutilate rogues. Roughly 3-5 seconds before the stacks run out, you swap back to Deadly Poison and refreash, then swap back. My rogue is fairly bad geared (2 parts T8 and 2 parts T8.5, and my nonset parts aren't of the best. Only around 3.7k AP unbuffed), but with weapon swapping, I still manage to pull off around 7.3-8k dps fully raid buffed on targets where I can just stand still.<br />
<br />
You gain a huge amount of dps on targets where you can stand still most, if not all the time, but targets when you have to move or switch target often, you don't get so much (obviously).<br />
<br />
I aswell think there should be a change to this, make Deadly Poison proc Instant poison on non players if it's equipped on offhand. There's 1 trillion gazillion ways they could buff mutilate in pve (since it's still not that compeditive if you don't weapon swap) without buffing them in PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My thoughts as well. I have tons of just &quot;Fun&quot; gear laying in my banks from lvls 1-70 still. I hope it doesn't drastically effect me with this new system. I think it's an interesting feature and I'm looking forward to it, but this one particular part has me a bit concerned.</div></div><hr />

WTF is about wands? They just suck. Especially after 3.3 hits because you're able to spend 5 talent points before you even start concidering mana a problem.</div></div><hr />

Hybrid DPS Specs in Arena<br />
We admit that ret paladins (and boomkins and shadow priests) are under-represented in high-rated 3v3 and 5v5 arena, but they should just l2respec like everyone else - LOL!<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand that people are still sensitive about ret paladins and boomkins globalling people at the start of 3.0, but people have resilience now, and burst damage doesn't win games like it used to. Blizzard, you've spent the past 6 months making TANKS viable in arena, but you do nothing for actual DPS specs? You'd rather they respec to a completely different gearset and playstyle every season just to remain competitive?<br />
<br />
It's one thing for a hunter to respec between BM and Survival, or for a mage to respec between Arcane and Frost. I mean, sure. There's a huge difference between playing an Arcane mage and a Frost mage in PvP - but when you get right down to it, you're still fulfilling the same role, just with a slightly different toolset. Asking a ret paladin to respec holy or a boomkin to respec feral/resto is essentially telling them to reroll a brand new character.<br />
<br />
I don't personally play a ret paladin, a shadow priest, or a boomkin, but my sentiments go out to them. Blizzard's sentiments obviously don't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if actual Ret spec paladins are low, you have to ask yourself how many of them are essentially behaving like Ret paladins but going to get a great talent deep in Holy or Prot.<br />
<br />
To &quot;behave like a Ret Paladin&quot;, you have to have the 41pt and 51pt talents. Without them, you don't have any attack skills. <br />
<br />
We already suspected that the Blizzard design team do not know the first thing about how Paladins work. Now, we have confirmation from a blue.</div></div><hr />

The 20% nerf is applied after diminishing returns. That is why I am saying it won't affect the relative value of dodge and parry. The Icewell Radiance won't get you closer to diminishing returns by itself.<br />
<br />
The whole point of this change is so bosses can hit less hard but more often, for the same damage over time but with fewer deadly spikes. That should feel better to everyone overall. The reason I am reluctant to say that is because some players are going to go into Icecrown, find it hard, and then expect us to buff their class.<br />
<br />
It won't be Brutallus hard, at least most of the bosses and at least on normal mode. We're not going to be particularly sympathetic to players who find heroic mode too hard. (Source)<br />
<br />
Stamina less important?<br />
It arguably makes stam less important (though it will always be important for tanks). Many players are probably telling you right now that only stamina and armor are important because if you ever fail to avoid two boss hits in a row that you're going to die. Under that environment, avoidance loses a lot of value.<br />
<br />
If bosses hit for less in IC (which they will, since they will hit more often) then the value of avoidance for purposes of survival increases.<br />
<br />
I still expect many tanks will die in two hits until they get geared up a little. But they will, and then the ability to survive two hits in a row won't be as big an issue. (Source)<br />
<br />
I'm afraid it's all bollocks. If the bosses hit less hard, they will need spikes (gormok-ish or icehowl-ish) to make it challenging. Currently healers can just spam heal the tanks over the course of an encounter, and it will not matter to them if they have 50 or 0% total avoidance, as long as the tank doesn't get gibbed in time shorter than their cast time. On the other hand, if bosses hit way more often, it will be challenging (like algalon for instance), however the dodge nerf won't hurt as much as blizzard thinks it will. In my personal opinion it will lead to raids preferring tanks with higher EH anyway, and Blizzard's theory of avoidance being as important as EH in current and future content seems to be totally wrong.</div></div><hr />

This makes weapon swapping ideal for mutilate rogues. Roughly 3-5 seconds before the stacks run out, you swap back to Deadly Poison and refreash, then swap back. My rogue is fairly bad geared (2 parts T8 and 2 parts T8.5, and my nonset parts aren't of the best. Only around 3.7k AP unbuffed), but with weapon swapping, I still manage to pull off around 7.3-8k dps fully raid buffed on targets where I can just stand still.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
7.3-8k &lt;-- This<br />
<br />
You will never do 8k damage in T8, even you are using weapon swapping.<br />
<br />
The point is that, weapon swapping requires a lot of &quot;haste&quot; to be effective. It would increase your dps to 9.5k from 9k, but not from 6.5k to 7k.</div></div><hr />

When a shadow priest desides to quit arena instead of respecing - then its time to puff shadow priests ? <br />

Retribution in Arena<br />
Ret should be viable in Arena and all aspects of the game. You have to be very careful when you analyze Arena statistics however. If say Shadow priests aren't viable in Arena, then many Shadow priests would rather stop competing than to go Disc. We have found that many paladins will switch specs at the drop of a hat for PvP purposes. You individually may not, but that doesn't prove the trend invalid. So if actual Ret spec paladins are low, you have to ask yourself how many of them are essentially behaving like Ret paladins but going to get a great talent deep in Holy or Prot. How many of them switched to Prot because Prot is too good at healing? You can't just jump to a &quot;buff Ret&quot; solution. (Source)<br />

I've seen that coming.<br />
Hey, rets don't need love they just need hatred from the community and fake attention from developers. I can see it coming it Cataclyslol: Rets will get what? More dmg in more simple ways. Then they will be gibbing people again, people will cry and the damage will be taken away. It's been like this since start of BC :)<br />
<br />
They should just start to think about a viable system for ret. something with mehcanics synergies and combinable attacks/debuffs/buffs. And not just &quot;Oh ... rets are bad ... Why are they bad? hmm they have no snare no ms no interrupt and we don't want to give it to them because then they're not unique enough.

Wait, what? That's utter bullshit, it sure diminishes the value of dodge.<br />
With the 20% reduction after diminishing returns, your dodge reaches high values first, and every new point of dodge has a lesser effect, and then it is reduced by a flat 20%?<br />
Having the nerf applied up front, taking you to a virtual (and most likely negative) [base dodge - 20%] and then applying gains from dodge rating/agi would lead to a higher dodge % left for tanks with a high dodge (which probably have that because they have no other means of avoidance)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The entire dodge/parry/crit/hit system is outdated and overused.<br />
<br />
This guy had the right idea....<br />
<br />
<br />
You could easily fix this for Cataclysm. How? Get rid of the RNG from avoidance.<br />
<br />
Instead of dodging 100% of an enemy's damage 30% of the time, make it so that tanks dodge 30% of an enemy's damage 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
In addition, it seems more logical that a tank could cause a &quot;glancing&quot; type blow rather than dodge an enemy completely, especially in all that armor!<br />
<br />
In this manner, a tank would get hit by a boss 100% of the time, but he would reduce the damage taken by a combination of his armor, dodge, parry, and block (for paladins/warriors).<br />
<br />
This would completely eliminate &quot;spiking&quot; and allow healers to have more strategy in terms of using more mana efficient heals, not always spamming their biggest heal just so that the tank doesn't get two shot.<br />
<br />
On average, there wouldn't even be a huge change in damage taken, because a tank's 40% avoidance would just reduce 100% of the damage he takes by 40%, rather than taking 100% of the damage 60% of the time, and 0% damage 40% of the time.<br />
<br />
-----<br />
<br />
This would be a huge change in game mechanics, but I think it is a necessary one if you want to resolve this dilemma permanently.<br />
<br />
It would give you a lot more freedom in terms of encounter design, designing the combat ratings for level 85, and even the way that healing would play out in cataclysm (in terms of both heal numbers and mana costs).</div></div><hr />

In fact, why don't they get rid of the whole silly 'it takes more hit as you go up to get the same hit rating' and just combine miss and dodge. So if you have 100 hit rating, you'll always hit a low level mob, but a high level mob has enough dodge you won't always hit it.</div></div><hr />

No, he's right - if the nerf was applied BEFORE dimishing returns suddenly dodge becomes much more valuable. The second you walked into ICC 1 dodge rating would practically double in value while 1 parry rating would stay the same. By applying it after DR, this relative value (parry vs. dodge) stays the same.<br />

<br />
Second, you can't assume that less dodge turns into less Rune Strikes in such a simple manner.<br />

<br />
He's not saying it DOESN'T turn into less Rune Strikes, just that 20% less dodge doesn't mean 20% less rune strikes. A DK tank will dodge many more times than they runestrike - sometimes because they will dodge a few times before their swing timer gets a runestrike off, sometimes because the fight mechanics prevents them from doing so (movement/stunning/range), sometimes because the DK tank is nub and dumped their runic power without leaving 20 for rune strike. Yes it's less, but it *may* not be gamebreakingly less (emphasis on the *may*).<br />

Pretty sure it is because the tombs have hp and you have to free the players after the bombs have gone off. Grouping up the tombs firstly means dps on them is more effective (you can aoe), and secondly means the area to hide behind is a bit larger. The players have to move away from raid anyway if they get tombed, otherwise you will have too many tombed, why not put them in the same place :)</div></div><hr />

Earlier in the game LFG was not global at all (it didn't come global until half way through TBC). It was only usable in the cities. If you weren't in the cities you didn't have access to it at all. Now all the channels span every city.<br />
<br />

That's exactly what I meant. Example: you have 50% dodge outside ICC, but 20% inside. Now you get an item with Agi/Dodge rating, or more of that stat than the currently equipped one. This rating is evaluated as if you had 50% dodge, so it gives you a lot less Dodge, increasing your dodge by 0.01% instead of, say, the 0.5% you'd gain with actual 20% dodge, with no effective way to get good numbers of dodge again.<br />
Dodge rating gives the same gains as before, but Dodge as a whole is worth a lot less.<br />
Sure, most tanks can just stack parry and block instead, not that those cared for dodge anyway. But it will hurt bears very much.<br />
Bears usually only get a certain amount of HP before starting to stack Agi. Now all that's still effective is stacking Stamina.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This man speaks the truth.<br />
The common conception is (dodge% - 10) / (parry% - 10) &gt;= 1.88 then parry is better for a stat due to diminishing returns.<br />
Now say we have my brother's warrior for example. He has around 25% dodge and 21% parry.<br />
In this situation, 15/11 = 1.3636 (repeating of course). So dodge is still quite a bit ahead as a good stat for him compared to parry.<br />
Seeing as the 20% is reduced AFTER the diminishing returns, the value of 1.3636 stays the same and one more point of dodge will still give more avoidance than 1 more point of parry even though parry isn't reduced by the icewell radiance and dodge is.<br />
<br />
So there's no point in stacking parry all of a sudden like so many people have been claiming...</div></div><hr />

Rogues frontload damage, a lot. If you look at damage meters in ToC, on most fights you see rogues climbing to 9-11k in the first minute, and then slowly dropping from there. It's just the way the class works, nothing to do with weaponswapping.</div></div><hr />

It uses all the items you own to make that determination, not just what you have equipped.<br />
<br />
Honestly though, we are really relaxed about how we use this restriction. It's basically in there to prevent newly minted 80s in quest greens from rolling into a heroic dungeon that is likely to kick their butt. Most players sophisticated enough to be on these boards won't run into it in day to day practice.<br />
<br />
Wait wait wait.. so we are going to get a messege with &quot;Your gear does not meet the requirements to this instance.&quot; What about guilds that power heroic guildies so they quickly become raid ready? Looks like the only way to get around this is to pvp even more.</div></div><hr />

Oh look it is the dickhead that spams Raid chat while the RL is trying to get people to roll on loot.<br />

GOOD JOB<br />

Try to read what i wrote. I know it's a short fight, but the fact is that I've been doing fights with my current gear in ToC and/or Ulduar25 and I've been at 7k aswell. I know how weapon swapping works, I've been doing it since Master Poisoner got changed and I know that it gives more than 2-300 dps. But that wasn't the point. The point was that someone told me that I couldn't do near that dps with my gear. I do it on most fights where I don't have to move shit loads. Other than that, it's not you have that many awesome cooldowns as mutilate, Coldblood and Vanish(overkill), not that huge compared to combat.<br />

Overkill count as a &quot;CD&quot; as you can vanish and get the buff again each time vanish is up, so yeah it's a CD.<br />
<br />
And he is an engineer, so he got another CD.</div></div><hr />

I mean, I'm sure the damage going around is pretty huge, but to me it just doesn't seem like a lot is going on.<br />
<br />
Then again, maybe I'm missing some things, the video isn't top notch quality.<br />

I find the LFG system that is coming up to be rather strange, the only thing that will appeal to any decent players who choose to use it will be the bonus badges, other than that I'm sure they will stick with guildies only.</div></div><hr />

You'll still be able to LFG normally on your own server - so in order to get in the queue for X-realm, do a few heroics on your server first.. easy peasy.. well, supposedly. <br />

You can't get in Random heroic if your average item level sucks. So you will not go to ICC Heroic in blues.</div></div><hr />

I should have been a little more specific i guess. I wasn't considering the ICC heroics in my statement.. it all depends on the level system they put in really, If you have to have Uld/ToC gear for ICC heroics thats fine. I was talking about current heroics for badges etc. You might need at least naxx 25 gear.. who knows. /shrug<br />
I think what people are misunderstanding is that you can still run heroics (your server only) on your fresh 80. You could be in epic lvl 70 gear for all it matters - its ONLY the cross realm LFG/random instance tool that requires the specific ilvl gear.</div></div><hr />

(i do agree ret was over power at the beginning of wotlk) And then when people start crying how ret dps is raping their ass (when they have no resi), blizzard just decides to nerf ret, 3 patches in a row and i am expecting more to come... which makes me think why the hell am i even spending that much time on this game and get juggled by blizzard. As if they are telling me its time to use another half a year to reroll another class and gear up and pay them more. <br />
not sure if u guys will like this game but i find it pretty cool, &quot;Aion&quot;, maybe its time to switch?</div></div><hr />
