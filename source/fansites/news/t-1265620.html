Why does everyone think there will be Titan info? That game isn't going to be released for another 4-5 years, they won't start the hype train until it's a year away (they learned from the epic mistakes of Diablo 3).</div></div><hr />

No point when the moment they do it will &quot;release the damn thing already&quot; and people start getting angry about it like Diablo 3 pre launch.</div></div><hr />

If they start hyping the game now, only to not release it for the next 8 years, that won't do the game very good.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly what I was thinking! Isn't there some math based on when Blizzcon is compared to when the next xpac drops? I remember something like 6 months from blizzcon - so we can expect burning legion in May 2014!</div></div><hr />

also this. according to blizzard they have NEVER made a profit off of blizzcon so it really is nice that they give their fans a huge event with concerts and stuff when they make no money back off it</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I believe that this is what we're going to see.<br />

I am also looking forward to the updated models, hopefully we'll see them all at Blizzcon. Unless that MoP thing that hasn't been announced yet is actually the new models.</div></div><hr />

Not only will xpac 5 be in a pretty complete state, they will probably have to launch beta in rapidly in 2014. This time next year players will be wandering the new zones...</div></div><hr />

<br />
They already have next WoW expansion to announce, assuming 5.4 will be out by november.<br />
<br />
Very likely a D3 expansion. <br />
<br />
And possibly Legacy of the Void, although that can wait a bit longer. Only 8 months since Heart of the Swarm release and since everyone knows what it is going to be roughly, there is no point for an early announcement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL you are right people would lose their minds....<br />
<br />
Because it would be an untested, unknown, very likely broken, steaming pile of crap.<br />
<br />
Also, people need to give up on the whole &quot;World of Starcraft&quot; thing. If Blizzard was going to do anything even remotely like that, they would not have allowed an SC2 mod (http://upheavalarts.com/starcraftuniverse/) that basically creates that exact same thing to be made.<br />
<br />
I'm honestly not expecting a Titan announcement. They will already have the next WoW expansion announcement, plus very likely a Diablo expansion to announce. A new IP would dominate the entire weekend with people clamoring for information. It would totally overshadow anything else they might talk about. Look for Titan info at a Blizzcon where nothing else big is really going on, like if they hold one next year for example (WoW expansion either already out or about to be, same with D3 expansion, LotV expansion likely still at least 6 moths away if not more).</div></div><hr />

<br />
They already have next WoW expansion to announce, assuming 5.4 will be out by november.<br />
<br />
Very likely a D3 expansion. <br />
<br />
And possibly Legacy of the Void, although that can wait a bit longer. Only 8 months since Heart of the Swarm release and since everyone knows what it is going to be roughly, there is no point for an early announcement.<br />
<br />
I disagree.,It is time for Titan. They have to let the world in on their plans sometime, if only to begin the hype machine, and it just FEELS right that now is the moment.<br />
<br />
The WOW expansion is clearly going to be announced as well and I would guess the trailer will include the reveal of the new and updated character models.<br />
<br />
A Diablo 3 expansion announcenment is also pretty likely.<br />
<br />
Starcraft 2 is iffy. Might get some introductory stuff on Legacy of the Void but I doubt it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Based on past trends for their ticket prices, expect either $200 or $225 per ticket. It went up $25 each year they held one in the past.<br />

As mentioned a few times previously, any Titan announcement of any substnace would completely overshadow anything else they wanted to talk about, because all anyone would want to talk about would be Titan. With a WoW expansion announcement almost a 100% certainty, in addition to a very likely D3 expansion announcement, they will not want those pushed far to the back in terms of relevance by throwing Titan into that mix too. <br />
<br />
Titan will be annouced during a Blizzcon where nothing of major importance otherwise is going on. A 2014 Blizzcon would be good example. No new WoW expansion announcement, D3 expansion either already released or about to be, still too early for any major news about Legacy of the Void. They don't want a repeat of the snoozefest that was Blizzcon 2010, so they would sooner not hold a Blizzcon at all if there was nothing to talk about. Which is why we didn't get one in 2012. So expect a Titan announcement when Blizzard announces a Blizzcon during a year where nothing else is going on.</div></div><hr />

Tenacious D was 2010. The last one was Foo Fighters, who I apparently like way more live than on recording. It was an awesome show.</div></div><hr />
