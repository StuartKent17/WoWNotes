I only know that blink sometimes doesn't work when you try to blink on a bridge and that kinda stuff... Other than that I believe everything's right. Maybe it's just lag? :\</div></div><hr />

Am I interpreting this correctly? Does this explain why my 2k ice lances were only 1500 last night?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No I've blinked backwards on many occasions in Warsong Gulch and in some staircases in instances, its obnoxious, its not a massive backwards blink but its still really really annoying when you are trying to run the flag or run from mobs and you blink the wrong direction or it wastes your time.<br />
<br />
<br />
This keeps biting me in the ass in Blade's Edge arena. I know what kind of terrain will cause blink to screw up, and just don't use the ability at that time. The main problem here is that when I need to blink, I need to blink-- not flail uselessly trying to get into range or out of range or whatever I'm trying to do.</div></div><hr />

A 41 talent that doesn't work AT ALL the way it's suppose to, oh and look it's a Priest talent that barely anyone uses cause it sucks! Go figure! :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bartel</div><div class="date">2007-07-11, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of those bugs where ingame before 2.1.3, this is more a list of all bugs ingame atm then just 2.1.3 bugs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Goulik</div><div class="date">2007-07-11, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">would be nice if you could at least clarify sources before &quot;claming&quot; that these bugs were introduced in this patch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Adamantite Bound Chests and Heavy Fel Iron Chests contain improper loot.<br />
<br />
This is old. Since they introduced these chests, they contained level 40-50 items within them. Which was 2.1 I believe.<br />
<br />
<br />
If a character with immunity (ice block, divine protection) resists a mass dispel, the immunity effect is still removed.<br />
<br />
This has been like that since TBC was released.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Stealth ability of the coaxed marmots in the Blade's Edge quest &quot;The Smallest Creatures&quot; is immediately deactivating upon cast.<br />
<br />
Happened before 2.1.3<br />
<br />
<br />
The Chance on Hit effect for the two-handed mace &quot;World Breaker&quot; fades before the +crit it provides can be utilized.<br />
<br />
before 2.1.3<br />
<br />
<br />
The item &quot;Spyglass of The Hidden Fleet&quot; is unable to be used while in druid shapeshift form.<br />
<br />
before 2.1.3<br />
<br />
<br />
Some major city guards ignore both Feign Death and Vanish<br />
<br />
pretty sure thats intended was added some patch ago.<br />
<br />
<br />
# A stunned paladin can cast Blessing of Protection on another player.<br />
# A sapped paladin can cast Blessing of Protection on another player.<br />
<br />
Pre-TBC, and intended.<br />
<br />
To say that 2.1.3 created these bugs. Which is what I gathered by your wordings, its pretty blunt.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-07-11, 09:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, &quot;Known Issues for patch 2.1.3&quot; is the official term, and it's pretty hard to track which bugs were added to the game at some point. Anyway, they're still here</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Nothing was said about those bugs being introduced in the patch... just that those were the know issues as of &quot;patch 2.1.3&quot; this is how it's been in every patch. <br />
<br />
haha I think you misinterpreted what was said, and I'm amused completely :-)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-07-11, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the most important one were added in the 2.1.3 :/<br />
<br />
It's not like it matters now that it's posted ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correct, my 3k crit Bolts were hitting for 2,5k on players who were (visibly) wearing no arena gear, they probably had 100-200 but reducing dmg by a lot more.<br />
<br />
Similarly though, Im guessing they were hitting me for a lot less than they would expect and probably thinking I have something like 500 resi ;D</div></div><hr />
