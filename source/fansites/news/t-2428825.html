Just to clarify a few more things about the Conquest System:<br />
<br />
<br />
Players who did not finish their Conquest cap this week can resume next week. This means, for example, characters you have who have never earned Conquest this week can, in 3 weeks, progress through 3 weeks worth of the conquest earning 3 items. In order to gain loot for the Weekly Cache (the chest in Mugambala and Hook Point), you must complete your Conquest cap for this week. The Weekly Cache will reward you loot based upon the highest rating achieved in a rated 2v2, 3v3 or Rated Battleground the previous week. This means you could reach Duelist rank, then drop down to Rival and still receive Duelist quality loot.<br />
Until the Mythic raid opens, all base item level items are capped at 360 within Mythic+ and Rated PvP. This means that Challenger and above players cannot gain items higher than item level 360 until then.<br />
All Dread Gladiator gear (https://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-expansion=8&amp;filter-search=Dread+Gladiator) – from the weekly Conquest, from the Weekly Cache, from end of match rewards – can have their item level boosted to the rating associated with your current rank using a Battleborn Sigil. Battleborn Sigil’s can be rewarded to you through PvP actiivites, as well as through a repeatable turn-in quest requiring 10 Quartermaster Coins through Xander Silberman at Mugambala and Marshal Gabriel at the salt and Shanty Inn within Hook Point. Quartermaster's Coin (https://www.wowdb.com/items/163827-quartermasters-coin) can be earned if you lose a bonus roll in PvP.<br />

Absolutely NOT!<br />
<br />
The ability to self-heal in bursts, and a low-cooldown ranged interrupt, have always been Enhance's niche perks compared to other melee specs. (As well as being able to do at least some ranged damage, which BfA thankfully improved with 20-yard Rockbiter, Flametongue, and Frostbrand)<br />
<br />
I'm also against Enhance nerf, because since as far back as BC, the vast majority of time Enhance damage is worthless compared to other melee specs in both PvE and PvP, with only rare exceptions in specific tiers of content (because of good gear itemization). It's nice to have good damage for once.</div></div><hr />

GG bli$$ard, the older the game is, the more unbalanced it becomes.<br />

<br />
Ret is fine where it is<br />
enhance damage is actually low...why does it need to be nerfed?<br />
I agree on affliction, but they've allowed warlocks to be a top spec for over an expansion now<br />
survival is a niche hunter spec and there arent a ton of them...maybe it needs a little toning down but not massive nerfs....MM...LOL are you dumb? <br />
<br />
wind shear should be increased cd for enhance shamn? what? you sound like a baby who just sucks at this game. every melee has a 12 second timer on their interrupt. <br />
<br />
I agree with paladin bubble<br />
<br />
but most of your post is a complete waaah whine post.<br />

Balance buff when? Absolute garbage for PvP and left to the dirt in PvE.<br />
<br />
Seriously? There's like one fight where it absolutely sucks...the rest of the fights it's part of the middle tier(yes lower part of that but still considered the middle) and then a couple it is top tier.....what are you complaining about?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A 5% nerf/buff is just tuning and really isn't that noticeable overall. If you are doing 15k dps, 5% of 15000 is 750. You are going from 15,000 dps to 14,250 dps.<br />
<br />
If You check Worldoflogs.com and check out the stats you can see some Specs are doing a bit too good and others are doing a bit too bad.<br />
<br />
I main a Rogue and have been playing this as my Main since late Vanilla. In Uldir and Mythic+ I switch between Sub and Outlaw depending on what is better for the encounter / Dungeon. It feels bad to get a nerf but 5% really isn't that much.<br />
<br />
Rogues are one of the most consistently strong classes which means they are also one of the most consistently nerfed classes because Rogues have always scaled incredibly well with gear. Hunters are another class that are consistently strong and scale very well with gear so they get regular nerfs so they don't get way OP... like Rogues. Hunters are still going to be very strong and so will Rogues; MM does need a buff though.<br />
<br />
Again... if you are still gearing and are doing like 9k DPS then 5% is just 450 DPS. 5% is a tweak not a Nerf Bat.</div></div><hr />

....<br />
....<br />
<br />
There's millions of players in WoW, but since BFA came out, there's now only about 1,000 raiding ferals. Throw us a fucking bone guys, our problem isn't low damage, our problem is that the feral class is fundamentally broken this expansion from the mangling of our spec last expansion. Our bleed talents were ruined in Legion making us basically combat rogues and now that we're rightfully back to being a bleed class, Bloodtalons blows at only +25% damage, our energy regen is absolutely pathetic, so much so that the winning talent to use is Sabertooth to keep my Rips rolling without losing absurd amounts of damage for wasting combo points.<br />
<br />
I'm seriously kicking myself this expansion for choosing to play the character I've loved raiding with for years.<br />
<br />
* Blood Talons isn't fun, there's literally nothing but complaints about it. It's weak, it's boring, no one wants to use Blood Talons. <br />
* Sabertooth isn't fun, it's a lazy talent. Lazy talents shouldn't be the best in that tree. &quot;Instead of buffing your overall damage with Savage Roar or using Brutal Slash for AoE, just use your finisher more often for maximum output&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
A +5% damage increase to our broken spec is an absolute insult, and a bench spot for any mythic raiders.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kokenhalliwell</div><div class="date">2018-09-11, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I forgot to mention I was PVP speaking not PVE speaking<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me guess, you are an Elemental Shaman and since your class isn't the strongest in PvP then the whole game has gone to shit? You are getting really worked up about this, maybe it's time for you to take a break from playing WoW for a few months.<br />
<br />
Elemental shaman is one of my main characters, yes. And it's not that it I want it OP, the issue here is that it has always been one of the forgotten specs for Blizzard, we all know that (such as Balance and other ones). Not everybody in the game jumps from OP to OP class each expansion, there are still a few people who remain using their main characters. Maybe you are one of those jumpers but I am not ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
yeah when i read the nerf MM part, i know you arent playing the game. Probably MM right now is the worst class at the moment, is shit on pvp and shit on pve.<br />
<br />
I got instakilled by MM a lot of times at the beggining of the expansion. Did they get that nerfed so it's not allowed anymore or something? I use BM so I don't know that, sorry (and BTW I have to admit that BM is also too OP)<br />
<br />
<br />
I think you need to take a break from the game. I am worried about your physical and mental well being.<br />
<br />
I am just sick and tired of so unfair things of the game -mentioned on my first comment- that should've been fixed long time ago and they haven't yet. Luckily I know lots of users who think exactly the same I do. But thanks for worring about me, I'll be fine lol<br />
<br />
<br />
Ret is fine where it is<br />
enhance damage is actually low...why does it need to be nerfed?<br />
I agree on affliction, but they've allowed warlocks to be a top spec for over an expansion now<br />
survival is a niche hunter spec and there arent a ton of them...maybe it needs a little toning down but not massive nerfs....MM...LOL are you dumb? <br />
<br />
wind shear should be increased cd for enhance shamn? what? you sound like a baby who just sucks at this game. every melee has a 12 second timer on their interrupt. <br />
<br />
I agree with paladin bubble<br />
<br />
but most of your post is a complete waaah whine post.<br />
<br />
Retry paladins damage is too high in PVP and same for Enhancement shamans considering the ammount of stuff they have to kill casters. And changing Enh Wind Shear from 12 to 15 or 20 segs it's not a huge problem, you could survive it, don't worry. Actually every other melee in the game has higher CD's on their interrupts (15 segs for rogues, monks, ferals, paladins, DKs and DHs and 20 for hunters) and not 12 as you said. Only the Enchancement shaman has that too low CD time.<br />
<br />
BTW do you think that allowing different number of healers per faction in BGs is fine? Or fighting russians in random BGs who ALWAYS join as Premades (and you can't even read and target their names while they can ours) is fair too? Do you consider that classes/specs/factions in the game are balanced on PVP? If you want to discuss something do it by showing data as I did and not with free insults, because it looks like the kid here is not me ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
PS: it is just funny how people get get offended that easily because someone considers that his/her class should be nerfed and think they have the right to insult someone because of that. So much hypocrisy.</div></div><hr />

Stop acting like Ele being weak and Rogues being strong in PvP is a surprise at the start of an expansion and is something new after Legion.<br />
<br />
I've been playing since late Vanilla... like 2 weeks before BC launched. I've mained my Rogue through name, race and faction changes since 2006. I've been raiding on my Shaman since 10 man Kara opened up in TBC. Class Balance is always a bit wonky at the start of expansions and it gets sorted out. <br />
<br />
Every single expansion starts with Shaman complaining they are free kills and every single expansion starts with everyone crying that Rogues are OP.<br />
<br />
One of the earliest DarkLegacyComics was &quot;Rouges are Overpowdered&quot; back in 2006.<br />
http://www.darklegacycomics.com/41 <br />
<br />
People are losing their shit like this is the end of WoW; This is normal for a WoW expansion.<br />
<br />
Over the Next Few months Rogues will be nerfed every week or two until they can't kill anyone in PvP and non-Rogues won't notice. Then Rogues will get a Buff to be viable again and everyone will cry that Rogues are always OP and FOTM. Then Rogues will get Nerfed again. It's a cycle Rogues deal with every expansion. I'm not complaining, I'm used to it.<br />
<br />
Same thing is going to happen to Ret. Ret is usually strong at the start of expansions then they get nerfed to shit in PvP. By November Ret will be useless in PvP again.</div></div><hr />

I've been playing since late Vanilla... like 2 weeks before BC launched. I've mained my Rogue through name, race and faction changes since 2006. I've been raiding on my Shaman since 10 man Kara opened up in TBC. Class Balance is always a bit wonky at the start of expansions and it gets sorted out. <br />
<br />
Every single expansion starts with Shaman complaining they are free kills and every single expansion starts with everyone crying that Rogues are OP.<br />
<br />
One of the earliest DarkLegacyComics was &quot;Rouges are Overpowdered&quot; back in 2006.<br />
<br />
People are losing their shit like this is the end of WoW; This is normal for a WoW expansion.<br />
<br />
Over the Next Few months Rogues will be nerfed every week or two until they can't kill anyone in PvP and non-Rogues won't notice. Then Rogues will get a Buff to be viable again and everyone will cry that Rogues are always OP and FOTM. Then Rogues will get Nerfed again. It's a cycle Rogues deal with every expansion. I'm not complaining, I'm used to it.<br />
<br />
Same thing is going to happen to Ret. Ret is usually strong at the start of expansions then they get nerfed to shit in PvP. By November Ret will be useless in PvP again.<br />
<br />
I've been playing since the Burning Crusade and to me there has always been unbalance in this game, early or late expansions. But the more expansions they release, the more unbalanced it becomes. And at the end of Legion DH and DKs were unkillable, and same for most melee classes, affliction locks and healers. If you wanna think there is balance in this game okay, that's fine, but that's not the truth. And as for Elemental Shaman, it has almost always been weak.<br />
<br />
There are some things of the wow essence that were corrupted since the game started to be a &quot;let's give everything to almost every class&quot;. Not sure if this happened because of the cries in the forums or because Blizzard just changed their thinkin. I miss when only a few characters could heal (besides healers), when not everyone could slow, interrupt, or stun. I miss when slows were something unique from certain classes or when effects from certain skills were necessary for teamplay and exclusive.<br />
<br />
And I also miss when armor was actually useful, because now it's pretty useless since almost every character does magic, poison, bleed or disease damage. I miss when the Moonkin was actually useful against melees because of his armor (&quot;Burning&quot; I miss you) and not a clothlike piñata, or when rogue stuns weren't one of the 4892349342348092 stuns and interrupts a character can receive in the same game or even in the same moment.</div></div><hr />

Not sure if this happened because of the cries in the forums or because Blizzard just changed their thinking about how the game must be played. I miss when only a few characters could heal (besides healers) since healing is suposed to come only from both holy (priest, paladin) and nature (druid, shaman) magic; or miss too when not everyone could slow, interrupt, or stun. I miss when slows were something unique from certain classes or when effects from certain skills were exclusive and necessary for teamplay, not a &quot;no worries if he/she doesn't do it, I will because I can too&quot;.<br />
<br />
And I also miss when armor was actually useful, because now it's pretty useless since almost every character does magic, poison, bleed or disease damage. I miss when the Moonkin was actually useful against melees because of his heavy armor (&quot;Burning&quot; I miss you) and not a clothlike piñata like now, or when rogue stuns weren't just one of the 4892349342348092 stuns and interrupts a character can receive in the same game or even in the same moment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm fury warrior, fury is in the bottom 5 of the worst dps in warcraftlogs....it is a fun spec, that's why I keep playing it, I didn't switch to arms because I hate it...and still I'm able to be the top 5 in my guild...which the other 4 are hunters/demon hunters.<br />
<br />
Instead of asking for buffs which I believe eventually they will come...I prefer to improve every day so I can out dps even the top tier ones.<br />
<br />
Get better at the game, not blame the buffs/nerfs.<br />
<br />
<br />

Nope. Guess I'll go back to killing enemies with a wet towel for now.</div></div><hr />
