Weekly Bonus Event - Legion Dungeons<br />
The Legion Dungeon Event is live this week!<br />
<br />
<br />
You will get one extra piece of loot from the final dungeon boss on difficulties below Mythic+.<br />
Pick up Emissary of War (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44171-emissary-of-war) from Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) in Dalaran to earn Cache of Fel Treasures (http://www.wowdb.com/items/147520-cache-of-fel-treasures)<br />
This quest requires you to clear 4 Mythic(+) dungeons and rewards Heroic Tomb of Sargeras loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
All week, open Group Finder (default hotkey: i) and then select Dungeon Finder to queue for any Legion dungeon on Normal or Heroic difficulty. Alternately, get a group of veteran dungeoneers together and travel to one of the Legion dungeons on Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
Look for the following all week long:<br />
<br />
<br />
Archmage Timear (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/111246-archmage-timear) near Violet Hold in Dalaran has a quest (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/44171-emissary-of-war) for you. Or, if you forget to pick it up there, you can start it from within the Adventure Journal. <br />
<br />
Quest requirement: Complete 4 Legion dungeons on Mythic difficulty.<br />
Rewards: One loot box containing a piece of gear from Heroic difficulty Tomb of Sargeras. <br />
<br />
Passive bonus: The final boss in each dungeon drop additional loot on all difficulties (except Mythic Keystone difficulties). <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP Brawl - Southshore vs. Tarren Mill<br />

In this game of war, you’ll need to work as a team and deplete your foes’ resources to claim victory.</div></div><hr />

Doubt it, that'll probably be saved for blizzcon since the most likely date for 7.3.2 is the week after (Nov 14/15)</div></div><hr />

Just be prepared for bleached and filtered questions instead of real questions.</div></div><hr />

i actually think they will reveal it's release date here, purely for the fact that blizzcon will be all about 8.0<br />
It would be a little weird having them talk about a new expansion while suddenly saying: ''ey remember the final raid of legion that we revealed everything about 3 months ago? yeah it's coming next week''</div></div><hr />

Interesting point. I kind of agree with you here.</div></div><hr />

Wrong direction, they'll hype Antorus, and then be, but what happens after.... queue into next expansion reveal.</div></div><hr />

I think this world boss will be the last one in the rota, to troll the alchemists. It has been up only once in the entire addon.</div></div><hr />
