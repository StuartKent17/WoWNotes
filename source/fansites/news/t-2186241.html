Heroes of the Storm - Primal Flamesaber Promotion Extended<br />
You've got a little bit longer to earn that Primal Flamesaber mount (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6317-Heroes-of-the-Storm-Promotion-Primal-Flamesaber)!<br />
Update: For Azeroth! Event Temporarily Returns<br />
<br />
Our recent “For Azeroth!” in-game event that concluded on Tuesday, March 14, came to an end a few hours earlier than we told you it would. As a result, a number of players who were still racing to unlock their mounts weren’t able to finish the quest in time, and we’d like to make it up to you. We’ve decided to extend the quest by a few days so that everyone has time to complete their games and claim their rewards.<br />
<br />

We’ve re-enabled the “For Azeroth!” event quest starting today, March 17, through Sunday, March 26. Any progress you earned prior to the quest’s original March 14 end-date will remain intact.</div></div><hr />

Weird. It took me about 4 hours to get it done. I did it over the course of 4 days playing around 60 minutes each day. Maybe you should use a more logical and efficient approach when tackling these kinds of things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get the mount you need to play 15 matches with a friend.<br />
At least one of the party members must be on your friend list (just add one person to friends). You must be playing a WoW character.<br />
The easiest way is to play against AI set to beginner. Get in team: Sylvanas (disables enemy buildings and units), Sgt. Hammer (long range, great against buildings, especially the core), Malfurion (heals + mana, go for innervate talents), Zagara / Xul / Nazeebo (summoning minions that can soak towers attack and help to kill enemy units). <br />
But honestly any comp will do the job. Just push one lane and ignore the rest. The best would be with camp next to it, so you can get support from it (ogres are great due to their rattack range).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

<br />
There is no logic in the game ... as for efficiency, I went for the hardest AI possible to increase the rate at which the games were lost - because the beginner AI was taking a very long time to let us win.<br />
<br />
Anyway - as I mentioned, it is only a mount ....<br />

Yeah, after the low AI matches took ages that's what I did.<br />

<br />
an HOUR per match against beginner AI???? How is that even possible? They should take 15-30 mins even if you're just derping around learning how to play. It forces you into a friggen tutorial when you first log into the game even to teach you how to do everything.<br />
<br />
And no result.. what does that even mean? The game didn't count for quest completion? Was your friend actually a bnet friend? Sounds like you were making it waaaay harder than it needed to be.</div></div><hr />

Well - the beginner AI does an awful lot to let you win and I had no clue at all what I was doing.<br />
<br />
<br />
And no result.. what does that even mean? Was your friend actually a bnet friend?<br />
<br />
No idea, it came back with no result and I wasn't given credit for a game towards the 15, and yes - I got credit with them for the first game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sounds like you were making it waaaay harder than it needed to be.<br />
<br />
Half right, it was way harder than it needed to be... but wasn't me doing the making :)</div></div><hr />

It forces you into a friggen tutorial when you first log into the game even to teach you how to do everything.<br />
<br />
And no result.. what does that even mean? The game didn't count for quest completion? Was your friend actually a bnet friend? Sounds like you were making it waaaay harder than it needed to be.<br />
<br />
Well, some people are just dead set determined to make things more complicated and harder than they actually are.<br />

Walk into AI controlled match against a robot, do nothing as instructed by everyone here - takes an hour to get 1 of 15 games.<br />

Why would you try to wait for the AI to BEAT you though. When you can basically 2 man win the games in less than 10mins. Your logic is astounding.</div></div><hr />

As I said earlier, it didn't beat me ... it lost. Also - as I also said earlier, I haven't played the game and have no idea how to play it.<br />
<br />
So no, one can't simply 2 man win a game in under 10 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Easy, you don't AFK. you simply walk towards the Enemy base, and destroy it in 6 mins.<br />
<br />
If you spent the time you've been complaining about how you can't do it actually just doing it, you'd have the mount already. <br />

You missed the part where I said most of the randoms I grouped with had never played the game until the event. The most information I had to give them was &quot;Run down mid and kill everything in the way&quot;<br />

** it would have taken 15 hours. I stopped, realising it was just a mount and wasn't up to that much punishment for a mount.<br />

you asked for help<br />

At NO point did I ask for help.<br />

I made one very simple, very factual statement ... that the mount wasn't worth the 15 hours of pain I'd have to go through.<br />

... 15 hours?? WHAT?? I played with a team where 4/5 were often completely new to the game (we invited from Gen chat) yet the event was finished within 3 hours total... That includes break times, people needing to go, replacing people etc during my second session. We were SLOW. If I'd been able to stick with the first team on the first session, I'd have gotten it done in less than 2 hours.</div></div><hr />

When it takes everybody else 5-10 minutes to do something it takes you over an hour to it means one of two things. And in an effort to not insult your intelligence, I'm just going to assume you're trolling and making it sound harder than it actually is.</div></div><hr />

Took my wife and I around 6 hours to get it all done (2 nights, 3 hours each night)<br />
<br />
This is because of queue times, we tried playing against the beginner AI, but the queue time was absurd (15 min per match queue time) - so we just played against intermediate bots, which had a 5 minute queue time, and each match took 20-35 minutes.<br />
<br />
It's most assuredly not as easy as some people make it seem, unless you have a way to completely bypass the queue times.</div></div><hr />
