So?Its still their game and it was launched this week.Plus,I dont think you honestly believe that they are developed by the same people.There is the wow team,and there is the hots team.</div></div><hr />

Easiest way I've found is by auto running to their base while letting them kill me after each resurrection and playing a different game at the same time. If I have to suffer to get a WoW pet by playing a genre I don't like, then my whole team should have to feel the same way.</div></div><hr />

Players like you are useless. If you have to suffer.....? No one is making you get that pet, it is just a bonus for players who play both games. You can still level to lvl 20 in games vs AI without intentionally trolling other players who want to legit play the game. However I bet you would still chose to be a feeder in QM because the experience is a bit more than vs AI. Players like you need to go die in fire.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, what's wrong with Blizzard showcasing the game that just went into release status days ago?<br />
<br />
I love WoW, don't get me wrong, but it's a 10+ year old game, and Blizzard just released something new. Showcasing it is the right decision.<br />

Holy christ. Go play AI games. You and players like you are quite literally the worst kind of poison in gaming today. By the way, by being an absolute piece of shit, you gain significantly less XP than you would be actually playing, and it will take you twice as long to 'suffer.'<br />
<br />
Seriously though, holy shit. How does somebody go through life, growing up into young adulthood or whateverthefuck age you are, and live with an attitude like this? What went wrong in their upbringing to make them think 'oh this is the proper way for me to act, I should definitely be a colossal douchlord, lord of the arseholes.' Seriously... 'my whole team should have to suffer because I want to act like a child having a temper tantrum' ... my lord.</div></div><hr />

you might have more fun if you tried. If you don't want to fight, consider picking up a support hero like Li Li - just get together with a strong hero, then stand by them and spam heals and occasionally whirlwind. As you level, take the Jug of 1000 Brews, and when you push you can massive heal your teammates.</div></div><hr />

Because, he's not playing to have fun, he's abusing the game to get the pet, so his friends in the lunchroom/breakroom/4chan can't make fun of him for not having it.<br />
<br />
Seriously, you were surprised by this behavior? The servers are overloaded with this type - &quot;Gimme gimme gimme&quot; has been the overwhelming rule of the land since vanilla, and only gets worse every year. <br />
<br />
Other players are completely irrelevant to this kind of person, except to shove their rewards they got on the backs of others in their faces. Kind of like how so many players want everything outside of raids to be removed, but expect players to stick around so they can show off their purples to them. <br />
<br />
These are not adults we're dealing with. And it's half of why I unsubbed. Life's too short to wallow in the sewer with greedy man children.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didnt they get a lot of people that made the mod to make DOTA2? Id say thats closer. Blizzard didn't make the Mod, they just made the tools. You could argue that they both have rights to the idea, but im on the Mod makers side this time. Blizzard should have had HOTS out 5 years ago tbh.</div></div><hr />

Only Icefrog is, Eul created Dota on Warcraft 3. But he disappeared apprently &amp; than Icefrog toke over.<br />
<br />
So really both Valve &amp; Blizzard created their games, but without the original guy we could say.</div></div><hr />

I'm with you on that, I'm about to cancel my sub which will be only the second time in 10 years that I've done so. Tells you something about this expansion when someone as loyal as me is about to quit. The last time I did it was Cata expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should cancel immediately before you forget. <br />
<br />
The game has lost it's way. Just a look at the fansites and their personalities, Twitch and the types of people streaming, and then actual gameplay should have led you to doing that a long time ago. It's not even a game anymore, I can't even describe it in a word. Sadly the legacy put in place 10 years ago is being replaced by those who stayed too long to the party. Before long someone will have to call the cops.</div></div><hr />

When heroes cost 10€/$ for a single character and bundles cost up to 40€/$ for not even all characters, then it is no way micro. We pay 40€ for a Wow expansion and not to diminish Hots in any way but this game is not a AAA title. The beta has shown us that the dev team for this game is nowhere near Diablo's, SC2's or WoW's.<br />
<br />
Saying all that, I still bought almost all of the stuff in game, cuz I like it :3</div></div><hr />

...and LoL is Riots Version of Dota. Which was built using Warcraft 3 characters and map building but whatever.<br />

Im curious why they bothered to do Butcher though. Stitches and Butcher are extremely similar in look and abilities. Wouldve prefered they did maybe Skeleton King or Imperius.</div></div><hr />

Probably to fit the theme of the map, what with the butcher being a demon and all, that said they could've chosen one of the archangels instead to fill the thematical role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I get they wanted to fill the thematic role, but Butcher/Stiches are just to similar I think. Countless other D3 charachters they couldve looked at. Hell, they couldve waited to release Jo the Crusader for it.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard should remember where the majority of their money is coming from. It definitely isn't coming from HotS store that's for sure...<br />

You're right, it's Hearthstone.</div></div><hr />

HOTS is well polished and basically a fun small game, like heathstone. I doesn't get why MOBA are prefered to RTS but maybe I am too old.<br />
Now no need to sell games, just sell good looking heroes, models and mounts on the shop <br />
I just hope graphical artists are well payed because Blizzard money rely mostly on their talent these days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People saying butches is exactly like stitches... did they even bother to read his abilities? <br />
<br />
He's an assassin. Stitches is a warrior.<br />
<br />
Trait: <br />
<br />
Butcher - Fresh Meat: Nearby minions drop 1 and heroes drop 3 fresh meat when they die, which you can pick up to gain 1% bonus attack damage. Can hold up to 25 meat. All meat is lost on dying. <br />
It's like an offensive version of Diablo's souls.<br />
<br />
Stitches - Vile Gas: When damaged, Stitches emits a gas cloud that persists for 4 seconds. Enemies who enter it are poisoned for 10 (+1.5 per level) damage per second for 3 seconds.<br />
Not similar.<br />
<br />
Q - <br />
<br />
Butcher - Hamstring: Slams your axe down into the ground, dealing 40 damage and slowing units by 50%. This slow fades away over 2 seconds.<br />
<br />
Stitches - Hook: Pull the first enemy hit towards you, dealing 40 (+8 per level) damage.<br />
<br />
W -<br />
<br />
Butcher's Brand: Deal 32 damage to an enemy and cause your basic attacks against them to heal you for 75% of the damage done for 5 seconds. Healing doubled versus heroes.<br />
<br />
Slam: Deal 55 (+6 per level) damage to enemies within the target area.<br />
<br />
E -<br />
<br />
Ruthless Onslaught: Charge at an enemy, becoming unstoppable and gaining movement speed. If you reach the target, they are stunned for 1 second and take 110 damage.<br />
<br />
Devour: Deal 300 (+20 per level) damage to Minions or 50 (+10 per level) damage to Heroes. Restores 19.92% of your maximum Health.<br />
<br />
R - <br />
<br />
Furnace Blast: After a 3 second delay, fire explodes around you dealing 685 damage to enemies. Can be cast while using Ruthless Onslaught.<br />
Lamb for the Slaughter: Throw a hitching post that attaches to the nearest enemy hero after a 1 second delay. This deals 75 damage and causes the enemy to be chained to the post for 4 seconds.<br />
<br />
Putrid Bile: Emit bile that deals 20 (+3 per level) damage per second to enemies within, slowing them by 35% . You gain 20% Movement Speed while emitting bile. Lasts 8 seconds.<br />
Gorge: Consume an enemy Hero, trapping them for 3.5 seconds. When Gorge ends, the enemy Hero takes 100 (+25 per level) damage. The trapped Hero cannot move or act and doesn't take damage from other sources. Stitches' Movement Speed is reduced by 15% while an enemy is Gorged. Cannot be used on massive Heroes.</div></div><hr />

HotS itself is still pretty boring, the only reason I play it is to play some of my favorite heroes and some friends play it aswell. If HotS didn't have the Blizzard stamp on it then I doubt it would even do half as good, even if it was the exact same game but just by an indie company.<br />
<br />
Still waiting for Kel'Thuzad to become playable, with hopefully an Eastern Plaguelands or Northrend map.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you might have more fun if you tried. If you don't want to fight, consider picking up a support hero like Li Li - just get together with a strong hero, then stand by them and spam heals and occasionally whirlwind. As you level, take the Jug of 1000 Brews, and when you push you can massive heal your teammates.<br />
<br />
No it's more fun to see people rage in allied chat.</div></div><hr />

:D nice, except that the numbers of keys used in hots is ridiculously low and I am not sure about such visible error as I played wc3x too.<br />
Even the tutorial is wrong with this key mapping, so for beginer, it's a very good point to start a game.</div></div><hr />

This butcher is a boss from Diablo 1 and 3, not the butcher in Highmaul.</div></div><hr />
