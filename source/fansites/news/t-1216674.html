I've always felt that Monks have been really weak healers compared to other healers (druids, paladins and shamans). Pretty much every healing Monk I know has been whining about buffs, especially to healing spheres... but I guess they might just be bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also Raiding With Leashes is a great way to give a little revamp twist on old raid content. It'd be cool if they continued to do it with TBC/WotLK/Cata raids as well in the future. Maybe have some ultimate pet reward for collecting the pets from every raid in the game.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much every healing Monk I know has been whining about buffs, especially to healing spheres... but I guess they might just be bad.<br />
<br />
Depends on level and circumstances.<br />
<br />
For the first 85 levels of the game, mana regen is kinda not an issue very much right now, and in that environment monks can do crazy well.<br />
<br />
In addition, if the damage you're receiving is coming at a low enough rate that &quot;fistweaving&quot; (healing via DPSing) is adequate, then monks will seem OP, since they're just going around punching stuff and nobody is dying.<br />
<br />
But my experience is that as you hit 85 and go to 90, mana becomes considerably more of an issue. You really have to forget many of the instincts the 15-85 game may have taught you, and PUGers really don't like waiting for healers to drink between pulls.<br />
<br />
As for healing spheres, my theory is that this change is to make the glyph become an interesting choice. Before the discussed change to healing spheres, they lasted so long that the glyph would be silly to take, and the only problem with them was idiot DPSers avoiding them instead of using them (and then whining about lack of heals). Now, they're much less useful than before, unless you glyph them, in which case they should become slightly (but not extremely) more useful than before.<br />
<br />
(Unless the glyph is changing too? I should log into the PTR on my 90 mistweaver monk and test that, as well as testing mana performance with her current gear under the new rules.)</div></div><hr />

No, it means that in PvP Blood* DK's can only heal for a max of 7% of their hp with Death Strike.<br />

This. What? Is? Really? Happening? <br />
<br />
While your at it, lets attach nukes to nukes and give cops the power of a judge aswell.<br />
<br />
At least give us other healers a little bit of a fighting chance to compete. They already dominate every fight in 25m ( Check out World of Logs)<br />
<br />
The last thing they need is a buff. And if you feel like you do need the buff, according to the top Monk healers in our guild, and from what I can read/see, you must be doing it wrong. <br />

It's probably their solution to CRZ messing with the tournament. Before they disabled the tournament one person winning would count across every realm they were crossed with making it even harder to win(not to mention the problem with different time zones and realm hopping)<br />

In pugs, you can never rely on your healing spheres because they are only useful if the puggers actually step on them. Most people I've grouped with were just unaware of the mechanics. Good thing it's going to be more than 10 seconds now...</div></div><hr />

Not sure what you mean, because clearly it scales with spell power at a rate of 2.6%.<br />

Being rooted and slowed are both equal problems. Classes that have a superior slow are capable of backpeddling while afflicted by hamstring can move faster than the warrior. This problem can make Avatar useless.</div></div><hr />

Oh give me a break. I'm extremely pleased right now seeing these are the only nerfs we've got so far. You KNOW we were too good in PVP. Especially after Hunters got their big nerfs. And shit I'm just happy to see we're not being totally gutted like hunters with the Beastial Wrath nerf rofl<br />
<br />
I don't think they're done though. I fully expect we'll see pummel nerfed as well, and cooldown stacking fixed somehow. Blizzard does like to go overboard with nerfs.<br />
<br />
I want to see Shadow Priests getting some nerfs now. They're going to be kings after 5.1 when Warrs/Hunts are dethroned. Their healing is stupidly OP.<br />
<br />
Also I want to see Rogues and WW Monks buffed, Ret could use it slightly too. Tone down ret's healing and buff the damage and ret is fine. Rogues and WW Monks I'm not sure what to do. They're both disgustingly useless right now in PVP.</div></div><hr />

It does scale but at a very miniscule rate. Just look at the chart again and see how slope barely goes up with 5.1 changes. I am sure it's a temporary change as they might be testing out something. <br />

You must be kidding right? Mages can't pyro more than twice during a deep freeze (what happened to deep freeze's 45sec cd?)(which makes them an auto crit regardless)(why are you playing fire anyways?) and they took 1 second off of deep freeze duration... Yep they sure did get nerfed to the ground. I'm just glad they took out my blanket silence, which requires a gcd and me to be facing the target. It was just too good compared to a mage's, which is off the gcd and doesn't require facing. <br />
The lock's Cataclysm, they sure did need another survivability cooldown. I'm not even sure how they've been living after the opening gate in arenas. They were so squishy to the point that they needed a literal channeled &quot;YOU CAN'T DIE&quot; cooldown. <br />
Also with the rogues too! I'm not sure if they're even pvp OR pve viable anymore with their 30 second nerf to blind. Blind on a 1min30sec cd is just too much! <br />
I'm not sure why they didn't take out the +20% damage buff that Avatar brings too, it was just way too good. It should only be a 3minute cooldown that just makes you big, because that's scary and will intimidate the other players into just dying from fear.</div></div><hr />

No, I am not kidding. Mages have undergone huge nerfs, from shaving down of their slows, to having to cast each armour, to RoF's CD and added cast time (to get full use out of it you need to burn PoM, another CD), to shaving down the duration of freezes, as well as IB being nerfed. The fire nerfs suck badly and are a horribly inelegant way to handle any issues with pyro from multiple sources. <br />
<br />
I know it's the trendy thing to whine about mages, but they have been nerfed over and over and over the course of the past few patches, to the point that ignoring it is just plain idiotic. There are still issues with frost's mastery and Blizzard does need to look at these because they've not solved the problem they identified in Cata, i.e. mage damage output for frost being too binary.<br />
<br />
1 sec off DF is 20% nerf to the spell. Re the mage silence, that also could do with a higher CD IMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
The lock's Cataclysm, they sure did need another survivability cooldown. I'm not even sure how they've been living after the opening gate in arenas. They were so squishy to the point that they needed a literal channeled &quot;YOU CAN'T DIE&quot; cooldown. <br />
Not sure if this is sarcasm, but destro definitely does need the CD. And it isn't a &quot;you can't die&quot; CD. The lock still can take damage, what the spell cannot be is interrupted.</div></div><hr />
