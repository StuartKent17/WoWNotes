Arena Tournament Realm Status – Online<br />
The Arena Tournament Realm is now available for everyone that previously registered for the 2009 World of Warcraft Arena Tournament. <br />
<br />
Upcoming Epic Gems and Profession Changes<br />
When the next major content patch launches we will be introducing epic quality gems and updating the perks for each profession. Please keep in mind that any of this information may see further changes before the patch launches.<br />
<br />
The design recipes for cutting epic gems will be made available for purchase with Dalaran Jewelcrafter’s Tokens and there are several ways to obtain raw epic gems:<br />
<br />
Prospecting Titanium Ore<br />
Alchemy transmutations<br />
Purchased with Honor<br />
Purchased with Emblems of Heroism<br />
<br />
Coinciding with the implementation of epic gems and the gain that Blacksmiths will receive through their perk from these new gems, we have gone through all of the perks in every profession and increased their values to match up accordingly.<br />
<br />
Alchemy<br />
The Mixology benefits from Northrend elixirs and flasks have been increased<br />
Added a new pattern for Flask of the North, usable by players with a high alchemy skill. The recipe is purchased from the honor potion vendor. The Flask of the North increases your spell power, attack power, or Strength for 1 hour, and is usable in arenas. It is not consumed when used.<br />
Endless Healing Potion and Endless Mana Potion no longer usable in arenas. Amount of health and mana has been increased, and the cooldown reduced. They are still usable everywhere else.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing<br />
No changes will be made to this profession; it will continue to have the 2 additional prismatic sockets (which can hold the new epic gems)<br />
<br />
Enchanting<br />
Values on Northrend ring enchants increased<br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
Increased benefits from Hyperspeed Accelerators, Hand-Mounted Pyro Rocket, and Reticulated Armor Webbing glove modifications<br />
<br />
Herbalism<br />
Increased healing from Lifeblood (Rank 6)<br />
Lifeblood now scales slightly with maximum health<br />
Lifeblood no longer affected by global cooldown<br />
<br />
Inscription<br />
Master's Inscriptions increased<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting<br />
Dragon's Eye gems stat bonuses increased<br />
<br />
Leatherworking<br />
Fur Lining values increased<br />
<br />
Mining<br />
Toughness (Rank 6) provides more Stamina<br />
<br />
Skinning<br />
Master of Anatomy (Rank 6) provides more critical strike rating<br />
<br />
Tailoring<br />
Embroideries improved</div></div><hr />

It's to equalize the benefit you receive for being every other profession in arenas.<br />

Only the gathering professions get bonuses upon skilling up (LW/Mining/Herb) whereas BS/Enchanting/Tailoring/Eng have to craft their benefits so stop acting like you're being singled out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now I wonder what the new values on the Engineering shit is......<br />
<br />
We can make a reasonable guess.<br />
<br />
Currently, engineering receives the same ivalue increase as every other production profession, it just isn't as good in realistic terms because haste isn't as good as spellpower. Tailoring gets an increased effect for the same reason as engineering has a reduced one: Because it's trading haste for spellpower instead of spellpower for haste.<br />
<br />
Currently, every profession gains 33 item value (that's 33 rating points, or 37-39 spellpower, rounding-dependent--spellpower costs 6/7ths of an item value point). To illustrate the current tailoring and engineering values:<br />
Engineering gives 340 haste with 1/6th uptime, or 56.67 haste. This is 56.67 item value. It replaces a 28 spellpower (24 item value) enchant, giving engineering haste gloves a value of 32.67. Slightly low, but remember, rounding.<br />
Tailoring gives 250 spellpower with 1/4th uptime (such procs with 45 second internal cooldowns are designed around one proc per minute--in realistic terms it tends to have higher than this, but from Blizz's balance standpoint, it's 1/4th), or 62.5 spellpower, a value of 53.57 item points. It replaces a 23 haste enchant, which is worth 23 item points. An increase of 30.57. Slightly &quot;low&quot;, from Blizzard's standpoint, but considered overpowered nonetheless.<br />
<br />
The epic gems, if previously mined data is correct, will be worth 20 points instead of 16. The yellow gems have 20 rating instead of 16, the spellpower gems have 23 (rounding down) instead of 19 (which rounded up--this may reduce how often you're better off with a red than an orange in a yellow socket and ignoring a socket bonus). So blacksmithing is gaining 8 value since its two extra gems will be gaining 8 value. I assume this will make the new value for all professions +41. In spellpower terms, this is 46-49, depending on how they round.<br />
<br />
So I can guess the new ring enchants will be +24 instead of +19 each. The new Dragon's Eyes will be 36 spellpower each instead of 32, or 31 rating instead of 27.<br />
<br />
Using the same math above to reverse &quot;engineer&quot; the engineering and tailoring enchants, the new lightweave embroidery would be 300 spellpower proc instead of 250 (could be slightly below, 280-300, depending on how they round and whether they use exactly 1ppm or something odd like 1.04), and the new engineering haste gloves would be 390 haste (again, could be anywhere from 380-400 really, but expect something near here) for 10 sec every 60.</div></div><hr />

I imagine it's something awesome like &quot;520 haste / 1820-2100 damage / 1200 armor&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think you´re missing his point a bit there.<br />
BS is the only profession who don´t get the upgraded itemstats on their profession for free when the patch comes.<br />
Ringenchants, embroideries and engineering-gadgets already put on your item will just magically be a little bit better.<br />
Not so for blacksmiths, the 2 extra sockets will still have the same gems you have in there now, there comes the need to get epic gems<br />
to feel the effect of the buff to professions in the patch (unless you are a JC plus a little silly and put your prismatic gems in a socket with no bonus before the patch...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I'm not a BS. That's why I laughed. But the mats for the others, if they are unchanged, are going to be pretty easy to get. And can be purchased now, well before there is demand. BS are either going to have to hoard titanium and hope for the best or shell out tons of gold. I think it's funny is all!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, kinda sad the BS isn't changed at least a little, perhaps remove the mat cost seeing as we have to PUT A GEM IN THE SLOT to get the effect anyway.<br />
<br />
The others seem rather balanced and I expected them.</div></div><hr />

Whatever you personally value, its there. On the otherhand, many of the other profesions have very few choices. As an enchanter I can choose SP, AP, or Stam. I would give anything to trade my SP ring enchant for equal itemization value in INT, but I'm stuck with SP unless I want to change professions. I think on balance, Blacksmiths will end up ahead (tied with JCs) in the end, but have to suffer through the time it takes for epic gems to become available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What the heck were you expecting otherwise? Two extra epic gems compared to everyone else is still a sweet deal.<br />
<br />
Besides, this is really only about epic gems and how it will affect profession perks, we don't know what else will happen with the profession (new designs, etc.). Just wait till the patch notes come out.<br />
<br />
Still...wish they'd announced this while the servers are still up so I could buy up all the Titanium ore before the prices go up....</div></div><hr />

You get more stamina for free and go do heroics for better gems to put in your unique to your profession sockets, which stack with enchants in that slot.<br />

Why? There's already the lesser Flask of Toughness...+50 resilience for one hour. Whose to say this won't be a +64ap/etc flask? It would make sense, and I really don't see them giving alchemists +180 ap/etc in arena...can you imagine what this would mean for double dps teams?</div></div><hr />

I was really hoping to see something along the line of mining given a choice of stat bonuses, inscription shoulder enchants getting a strength/crit version or fur linings getting a strength option. any of that stuff would be easy and go the whole way of balancing every profession with each other but I guess thats not blizzards goal after all ::)</div></div><hr />

1° This is not the whole extent of the profession changes, it's just the things that will compensate other professions for BS being able to use gems.<br />
2° Alchemists will get a bonus equivalent to that from other professions, ie around 30-40 iLvl points.</div></div><hr />

You can get the epic gems through emblems of heroism. So if you need 3 epic gems, you do x amount of heroics for x amount of badges and you pay nothing. Free gems.<br />
<br />
and I don't give two damns about the whole 'invested time' thing that everyone goes on about. I didn't pay any money out of pocket, and I got into a heroic that gave me badges for my epic gem, plus gold, loot, and the like. Invested time paid off more than buying an epic gem for however much someone paid for the epic gem from the ah. I got an epic gem and some gold.</div></div><hr />

It'll likely be the same as the profession BONUS the others give. We can all hope otherwise, but it would make sense for it to even out the bonuses with the others available in arena. Using it in a raid might not be optimal, but it would be better than nothing :P</div></div><hr />

That is exactly what Blizzard wanted to do, make Algalon-25 and Yogg-Saron 0Keeper enoughly hard (either by a hard unlocking or a hard encounter) to not be defeated by a high number of guilds before 3.2.<br />

Prismatic slots != prismatic gems. You still have to have the appropriate gem colors on your gear to activate your meta. The gem slots being prismatic just means the gems you put in them do not have to be a specific color in order to activate gem bonuses on those pieces of gear. This is assuming that you even need a gem in that slot to activate the gem bonus, but I'm not sure on that.<br />
<br />
They would not take away the prismatic nature of the dragon's eyes from JC just to turn around and give another profession that exact same boost. Also, your English is better than many native speakers on this board so no worries :)</div></div><hr />

I am sure raiders in progression guilds will not use it for progression raids, I am sure the &quot;classic&quot; northran flasks will still be better for progression raids, where this comes in VERY nice (and I as an alchemist will admit maybe a bit OP) is when we are helping wasting times in T7 (and by 3.2 T8) content well might want to flask for fun, but not a real flask, or for me as a resto/feral(cat) druid I tend to jump between both in lower content (and a few times in higher content) and this would be nice as it one flask instead of 1 flask per boss fight (oh i need SP, next boss oh I need AP, next boss fight I need SP again) for content 1 tier or more behind this would be nice, but for real raiding (read progression raids) alchemists will probably still use the same flask as every one else (we still just get the 2 hours out of it while you get 1 hours)<br />
<br />
I still bless the day back in Dec 06 that I picked up Alchemy: Crazy Alchemist potion and now the buff to the endless mana and health potion (I PvE, BG and WG, I don't do arenas so the change does not affect me), the double length to my flasks (along with the standard profession bonus of about 32 to 37 spell power) and now the flask of the north.</div></div><hr />

Don't boo who about it, it not that bad, every one else needs to flask up also, we just get our bonus there PLUS we get to do it 1/2 as often so we don't have to use as many flasks. I am serious I am so tired of other alchemists QQing about alchemy, the long and the short of it is WE HAVE THE BEST profession, along with the same bonus every one else gets and double length flasks, we have crazy alchemists potion (I am still shocked that it has not been nerfed it is OP I admit) I can envision the change to the endless healing and mana potions becoming OP (could you imagine if they bumped them up to what a full mana and health potion does on a 1 minute cooldown, the other professions will be fully in their right to call for a nerf to them)<br />
And for BGs and WG the flask of the north will be nice (yes they are making it for arena but there no rules saying we can not use it in BGs, WG, and while messing around on other stuff)<br />
I am sorry but alchemy is fast becoming the MUST have profession for raiding if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

Update - The european PTR forums have been cleaned and the PTR FAQs have been updated (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/index.html), PTR 3.2 this week? <br />
There currently is no PTR available, so if you are trying to access the PTR and failing, this is why. Because of the differences in timezones, the PTR may become available before this message is updated. In the interests of keeping this forum relatively tidy, please reply to this thread instead of adding yet another &quot;Is it live yet?&quot; or &quot;I can't access the PTR - WHY?&quot; thread. Thanks everyone! :-) <br />

Arena Tournament Realm Status – Online<br />
The Arena Tournament Realm is now available for everyone that previously registered for the 2009 World of Warcraft Arena Tournament. <br />
<br />
Upcoming Epic Gems and Profession Changes<br />
When the next major content patch launches we will be introducing epic quality gems and updating the perks for each profession. Please keep in mind that any of this information may see further changes before the patch launches.<br />
<br />
The design recipes for cutting epic gems will be made available for purchase with Dalaran Jewelcrafter’s Tokens and there are several ways to obtain raw epic gems:<br />
<br />
Prospecting Titanium Ore<br />
Alchemy transmutations<br />
Purchased with Honor<br />
Purchased with Emblems of Heroism<br />
<br />
Coinciding with the implementation of epic gems and the gain that Blacksmiths will receive through their perk from these new gems, we have gone through all of the perks in every profession and increased their values to match up accordingly.<br />
<br />
Alchemy<br />
The Mixology benefits from Northrend elixirs and flasks have been increased<br />
Added a new pattern for Flask of the North, usable by players with a high alchemy skill. The recipe is purchased from the honor potion vendor. The Flask of the North increases your spell power, attack power, or Strength for 1 hour, and is usable in arenas. It is not consumed when used.<br />
Endless Healing Potion and Endless Mana Potion no longer usable in arenas. Amount of health and mana has been increased, and the cooldown reduced. They are still usable everywhere else.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing<br />
No changes will be made to this profession; it will continue to have the 2 additional prismatic sockets (which can hold the new epic gems)<br />
<br />
Enchanting<br />
Values on Northrend ring enchants increased<br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
Increased benefits from Hyperspeed Accelerators, Hand-Mounted Pyro Rocket, and Reticulated Armor Webbing glove modifications<br />
<br />
Herbalism<br />
Increased healing from Lifeblood (Rank 6)<br />
Lifeblood now scales slightly with maximum health<br />
Lifeblood no longer affected by global cooldown<br />
<br />
Inscription<br />
Master's Inscriptions increased<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting<br />
Dragon's Eye gems stat bonuses increased<br />
<br />
Leatherworking<br />
Fur Lining values increased<br />
<br />
Mining<br />
Toughness (Rank 6) provides more Stamina<br />
<br />
Skinning<br />
Master of Anatomy (Rank 6) provides more critical strike rating<br />
<br />
Tailoring<br />
Embroideries improved<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

1) don't quote the whole post to talk about 1 thing in it<br />

2) no, go look at BC, they were available with badges then too.</div></div><hr />

Seems like we shouldn't expect anything new, especially PVE wise.<br />
I still have hopes though.</div></div><hr />

I'd been slacking off to work on 50 mounts for another toon. Oh well. I've got a fair number stored already so I'm not too worried. By the time 3.2 actually goes I'll have a good number saved up. I'm curious to see if they implement any of the other low chance situations for epic gems (through the prism and through mining). <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I'm curious to see when the various professions will get their trinkets. It took JC and Alchemy until 2.4 in TBC so I'm wondering. Engineering could really use some love.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't...but when you put the WHOLE post in that context and then express your frustration in caps...you have completely convinced me. Heaven forbid dirty casuals get an extra 25 stat points because they can also get epic gems with the badges they earn rather than paying gold to buy them. That will certainly be the deal breaker there!</div></div><hr />

You are getting about the same stat benefit as the other professions through 2 extra jewel slots. Epic gems will be easily attainable if you farmed a handful of badges as well, so pray tell, why are so many people crying about it?<br />
<br />
Also, I do not see any epic alchemist/JC trinkets in the near future. Blizzard made its point that it wants stat bonuses from professions homogenized. Sure the trinkets are ok for leveling, but to keep one profession from being more overpowered than the other during pve progression, again, benefits need to be near equal between professions (more often than not, people in ulduar have already stopped using their JC/alch blue trinkets). Maybe close to a new expansion, epic JC/alch trinkets will be released, but they won't be anywhere near the quality of the trinkets that drop in the endgame raid at that time for the reason stated previously.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ergwendith</div><div class="date">2009-06-18, 12:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can't believe blacksmiths are complaining about these changes, do you really not understand anything? The whole reason behind buffing the other professions is that Blacksmithing would be overpowered if they didn't. Blacksmithing isnt listed as being changed, but the implemention of epic gems is automatically a buff to blacksmithing.<br />
<br />
Here, I'll break it down to you. Here are the profession self buffs (perks) at the moment.<br />
<br />
I will use spellpower for my comparison, the ratios are the same for other stats.<br />
<br />
Blacksmithing: 2x extra sockets = 38 spellpower<br />
Enchanting: 2x ring enchants = 38 spellpower<br />
jewelcrafting: 3x JC only gems = 39 spellpower (compared to using runed Scarlet Rubies)<br />
<br />
I'm to lazy to look into the other profession bonuses but the point is they're all (atleast the ones that give stats(lol sucks to be an engineer)) pretty much the same, somewhere between 37-39. Since the blacksmithing bonus depends on the stats of the gems you wish to put in your extra sockets it would also gain a lot more than the other professions if they added the gems without making those changes. Lets say you as a blacksmith socket 2x http://www.wowhead.com/?item=40113 in your two bonus sockets. That would give you a bonus of 46 spellpower, far more than anyone else. <br />
<br />
Why are you all so predictably stupid EVERY GODDAMN TIME there is a change? It was the same deal when they announced that jewelcrafter gems would no longer be prismatic. 300+ or so posts of pure QQ-vomit that Blacksmithing would be overpowered when epic gems came out. OFFCOURSE THEY WOULDN'T ADD EPIC GEMS WITHOUT BUFFING THE OTHER PROFESSIONS TO ALLIGN WITH THE BONUSES YOU STUPID F*CKS!</div></div><hr />

That's not far more than everyone else because the other professions are receiving buffs, not staying static. JC only gems will grant more spellpower than before, alchemist flasks will receive a greater bonus etc. So 46 spellpower won't be far more than anyone else.<br />
<br />
Not QQing (I'm JC/Alchemy) but 46 spellpower will be equal to or less than the other buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is no logic as to why BS's are complaining. It's basic common sense thing all professions will be point-for-point on par stat wise come 3.2.<br />
<br />
The only advantage BS's (and JC's) will still have is the ability to use their perk to get stats other then SP/AP/stam. This will still make them technically better then the others in a few cases.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nice! Now a survival hunter can do the trap dance AND use black arrow at the same time, through snake trap. I like this change, a lot, a whole lot. The ability to trap dance was always something that, while novel and very definitive of a skilled survival hunter, was pretty much useless after the introduction of Black Arrow. It made it a faceroll class. Now trap dancing should be essential to maximizing dps. Thanks for making hunter a blast to play again.</div></div><hr />
