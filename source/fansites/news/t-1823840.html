Patch 6.2 Hotfixes - July 22<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
Hellfire Citadel<br />
Hellfire High Council<br />
<br />
Fixed a situation where Mark of the Necromancer (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/184676-mark-of-the-necromancer) could stop dealing damage to players.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Ashran<br />
<br />
Winning events in Ashran should now always award a Dented Ashmaul Strongbox (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128214-dented-ashmaul-strongbox#related:contains-item).<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Etheralus, the Eternal Reward (http://www.wowdb.com/items/124638-etheralus-the-eternal-reward) absorption effect should now correctly factor in Multistrikes from Healing Stream Totem and Healing Tide Totem. Additionally, healing dealt by Spirit Link's health redistribution no longer counts towards the absorption effect.<br />
Nithramus, the All-Seer (http://www.wowdb.com/items/124635-nithramus-the-all-seer) damage effect should now correctly factor in damage caused Prophecy of Fear's Doom Nova.<br />
Prophecy of Fear (http://www.wowdb.com/items/124230-prophecy-of-fear) Doom Nova effect should no longer be incorrectly triggered by Sunfall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Rogue<br />
Talents<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where Venom Rush (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/152152-venom-rush) could incorrectly persist indefinitely.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paragon - Mythic Mannoroth Kill Video<br />
We looked at Method's Mythic Mannoroth video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ACk8B-ZMhw) recently, so today we are taking a look at Paragon's video while we wait for more guilds to clear Mythic Hellfire Citadel. <br />

Arms Nerf Justification<br />
Prior to the nerf earlier this week, Arms was outperforming most specs by a considerable margin on virtually every fight in Hellfire Citadel. Our intent with the reduction of the 4-piece bonus this week wasn't to drastically reduce the viability of Arms Warriors, but rather to tone their DPS down just a bit and bring them more in-line with other damage dealers, while also fixing a bug that exacerbated the issue. <br />
<br />
The nerf has only been in effect for a little over 24 hours, but so far Arms still seems to be doing very well. We'll continue to monitor how this change -- along with the changes we made to other DPS specs this week -- play out in Hellfire Citadel. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/381362-revert-the-nerf-on-arms/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300184889?page=1#12))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
The only reason I play Horde PVP in WoD is for the faster ques, same reason I played Alliance in MoP. Dont take my fast ques away.<br />
Why do you think it will make your queues longer? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621476125697376256))<br />
Competition for spots, beforehand the horde would go straight in the spot, now loads of ally are contending for it<br />
It is based on queue times. Currently, it would only be available when there are a lot of Alliance waiting. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621478118356750336))<br />
If it ever got to the point where the other faction was waiting too, it would turn off. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621478204360921088))<br />
<br />
If mercenary system get approved from the community on unranked pvp is there any chance to bring it to ranked arenas/rbgs? <br />
The intent of Mercenary mode is to fix long queue times caused by faction populations. Doesn't apply to Ranked PvP. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621480718481252352))<br />
<br />
Why merc mode over, say, this: http://t.co/489d3Sxca7<br />
A number of reasons. First, assuming the proposal as a non-optional thing: Sometimes Alliance just end up on Horde side. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621532630467526656))<br />
It is very jarring to suddenly be on the opposite side in starting area themed around the other faction. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621533017249460224))<br />
Second, it doesn't benefit the less represented faction in any way. Merc allows savvy players to switch sides to help. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621533392765476865))<br />
Third, we want to preserve the faction conflict in our unrated battlegrounds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621534412509843456))<br />
<br />
In Mercenary Mode mode will players who are placed on opposite side wear the mask or is that a blog element only?<br />
The NPCs have masks. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/621534578168061953))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
It's just funny, Darkmoon firewater stacking, hotfixed in 2 days. PvP gear hotfixed in two months. Fun nerf &gt; PvP<br />
Bugs and design changes are not created equal. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621798605070819328))<br />
<br />
Mount size nerf, undocumented in 6.2 notes. Can I get clarification on this please?<br />
The change in 6.2 was too severe. We're currently discussing how to find a happy medium. We don't hate fun. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/621814186495078401))<br />

There is always a smart ass like you to answer. Disregarding the sims from wich he clearly said that and that i play arms rly good the spec got shit after the fix/nerf. Only point to have it is velhary and debatable on some other fights archi, xhul but it doesnt even gets close to fury anymore. So atleast when u commenting say something normal dont bash the other guy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh... a 36-pack MTG booster box is like $100.<br />
<br />
This is actually a discount, too, and only $45 if you buy it with Amazon Coins.<br />
<br />
I mean, not thrilled that it's the only way to get the card back, but it's still a F2P game. You can still just save up gold and buy packs that way.<br />
<br />
Personally, I don't mind spending a little bit on it now and then, given how often I play it. I've only purchased 7 packs so far... opening 50 (plus how much ever gold I save) would be really fun.</div></div><hr />

Arms is trash. I'm glad it got gutted.<br />
<br />
Also are they still trying to cram merc mode down our throats?<br />
Can they just remove the rated ladder already if they're going to make it entirely useless for an entire faction? There's already no reason to play Horde and making it easier to gear on Alliance really removes the only reason to actually be Horde right now. Holinka needs to go.</div></div><hr />

Like can it not have the spotlight? Like Warlocks did in MoP, or how Arcane Mage is ALWAYS good, when something else becomes good though, its gotta be nerfed... Let arms have its time, just like every other spec should... Another example would be Frost DKs, they just got buffed but were doing &quot;too well&quot; so got nerfed, meanwhile arcane mage is ALWAYS top of the single target dps, and never gets touched, alright Blizzard really good nerfing logic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. Arms has always, and will always be a redundant spec. Annoying how they keep it around by occasionally buffing the living shit out of a few abilities. The Damage dealing and Tank specs of the Warrior class are clearly defined.<br />
