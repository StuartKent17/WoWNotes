Legion - Transmog System<br />
GamesBeat (http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/06/world-of-warcraft-players-your-bag-space-problems-may-soon-be-over/) had a short interview with J. Allen Brack that covered the new Transmog system.<br />
<br />
<br />
The new Diablo 3 inspired system will include tabards. <br />
The designer that worked on the Diablo 3 system is working on the WoW system now.<br />
In Diablo 3, once you obtain an item, you have unlocked the appearance and don't need to keep the item anymore. <br />
The system will make transmog more of an item collection system and help to clean out your bags and bank.<br />
The team knows that the limited backpack size isn't ideal, but they have to find everwhere in the code that assumes it is a fixed size. They tried increasing the number of slots but items would disappear into the void and be mailed back to you. <br />
<br />

Legion Community Amphitheater Discussion<br />
The Instance (http://theinstance.net/) hosted a discussion at the Community Amphitheater with several of the developers. This did not appear on the Virtual Ticket.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Story, Lore, and Questing<br />
<br />
Wowpedia (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Portal:Main) is a great resource for the team to see what they have done with characters in the past. <br />
Sometimes if there is something very cool they will contradict the lore a little bit to do it. <br />
It is very important to the team that every single designer gets to contribute to the story.<br />
Most of the priests you would recognize are Alliance, so some new Horde priests are going to be added.<br />
Alleria is tied to the Marksman artifact weapon, so you will see a little bit about where she has been through that experience.<br />
In Draenor several characters promised to help fight the Burning Legion or visit Azeroth. The team wanted to limit how much of Draenor leaked out, as it was an alternative timeline, but they may appear in the future at some point. <br />
Jaina will play a role in Legion, maybe not a huge role. <br />
The events at the Broken Shore are devastating and are really going to shake things up. The Alliance and Horde will be reeling from that throughout the entire expansion.<br />
Many of the major characters use multiple specs, so Thrall may be Elemental and Enhancement. <br />
<br />
<br />
Questing<br />
<br />
Individual quest designers tend to put up their own ideas when it comes to specific content and parts of a zone. They are really excited about working with previous characters, working with the creative development team to fact check the lore and make sure it is consistent. <br />
Individual quest designers usually have favorite characters that they enjoy working with. <br />
Lorewalker Cho shows you his ancestors for one quest and all of the models used are rejected Lorewalker Cho models from earlier in development. One of them is wearing a Timewalker tabard.<br />
The Artifact and outdoor world quest lines use the NPC models and voice acting to enhance the quest experience more than ever before. <br />
When you hit max level, the team doesn't want you to feel like the questing experience is over if that is content that you enjoy. The team has been working on the max level questing experience, taking the lessons of Pandaria, Timeless Isle, and Tanaan Jungle to create an experience that allows you to log in and have things all over the world that you can go and take part in. <br />
Legion tries to enable more types of gameplay at max level. If you enjoy questing, there will be a nice questing experience. If you enjoy dungeons, the new scaling will keep them relevant for you throughout the entire expansion. Raiding is still there and fantastic. <br />
One of the quest designers switched to working on professions for Legion, bringing his experience from quest design to create profession related content that will last for quite a while during the expansion. <br />
<br />
<br />
Class Halls<br />
<br />
Rogues can sneak around their hall and pickpocket each other! <br />
Garrisons were really fun for the first couple of months, but not so much after that. The team is aware of this and careful about not bringing the bad parts of garrisons forward with Class Halls.<br />
Velen plays a role in the Priest hall. <br />
All of the Class Hall locations are finalized. One will be previewed during the panel on Saturday. Others may be shown before beta, but there are no solid plans yet.<br />
The team wants to strike a balance between players spending time in the Class Halls and the major cities. You will be going to the Class Halls multiple times per day and there are some special features you may want to hang out for. <br />
The Warrior Class Hall has an arena thing that you can participate in. Every Class Hall may not have something special like that, as it reduces the variation. <br />
Warlocks overstep at the start of the expansion when the Order Hall is introduced, getting greedy and think they have more power over the Legion than they really do. <br />
<br />
<br />
Artifact Weapons<br />
<br />
Some of the Artifacts will have a history that is well known to players, but there weren't 36 of them to use. The team had to make very compelling story lines at the start of the expansion to make players feel like their weapon is important and has a history. <br />
There will be multiple people carrying the same artifact weapons, but this was already the case with weapons from current raids. There is actually more variety because each of the 36 weapons have different models and colors for each individual weapon. <br />
Artifacts are trying to create an interesting long term progression system that gives you something to do even after you hit max level. <br />
Artifacts will take some effort for other specs, but you should be able to switch specs. The further behind you are, the faster it goes. Keeping two Artifacts completely maxed out may take some more effort, but switching and catching up or keeping one Artifact a little bit behind shouldn't be too bad. <br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Class specific blogs with lots of details are coming starting on Sunday! <br />
The class team makes changes for mechanical reasons fairly often, but Legion is giving the team a chance to focus on the class fantasy as much as they do for quests and the general story. <br />
There will be a lot of class mechanic and aesthetic changes in Legion to try and bring classes back to their roots, as well as making the different specs more distinct.<br />
The team is trying to develop different ways to handle class balance and tuning without harming the fantasy and fun of the classes and specs. The new PvP leveling system is one example, allowing them to tune classes specifically for PvP.<br />
The team is really focusing on class fantasy in Legion. What do the different classes do when they are hanging out in their Class Hall?<br />
The team plans out the major story lines very early in the process and build the progression of the zones along with them. Those stories have been becoming more important and numerous in each expansion. <br />
Stagger is not going away. <br />
Brewmaster gameplay does not deliver on the fantasy very well right now, as the biggest thing that matters to them is Guard. You generally think of a Brewmaster dancing around and avoiding things and when you do hit them, they don't seem to take a lot of damage.<br />
The team tries to avoid drastic class changes in smaller patches, but with major patches and especially new expansions they can make larger changes.<br />
Set bonuses got really strong in Warlords, providing some variation to gameplay, but there will be other systems that fill this role in Legion, especially the Artifacts. They will be fun and exciting, but maybe not quite as strong. <br />
Talents are one of the best ways to distinguish the different classes and specs. Legion will have a lot more spec specific talents, adding variety to the different specs. <br />
The team is adding some loose themes to talents. For example, all of the left column talents may have something to do with rage, all of the far right ones are a weapon enhancement, and all of the middle talents are something else. <br />
The team isn't trying to use Artifacts or Class Halls to fix classes or change how classes work, but instead build upon what the class already is. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sound<br />
<br />
When the team was working on Pandaria, they wrote a song for Lorewalker Cho to sing. The voice actor was given a tune and gibberish song and it came out great.<br />
In Starcraft, the sound team was doing an operatic passage that used Latin and French. The lyrics were mostly meaningful, but part of it was the team's names and other bizarre things.</div></div><hr />

What a load of horseshit. It's like they don't understand how raiding works at all. Especially when half the fucking players come and go it's very fucking important that people are able to switch specs easily to fill in gaps. They already make it impossible now to class switch to help out your guild since you have to do lfr for 3 months to get the fucking ring.

You do know that once you have the legendary ring it is a matter of ponying up 1600 or so gold to buy the off spec ring..<br />

Agreed. some of us have to maintain 2... some 3. Perhaps the weapons should each have to be initially acquired, but then level like a single item that switches specs with you. You could set the points per spec. I don't mean to sound lazy, but I can see this being a real pain in the future.</div></div><hr />

Yep, we should not be punished for trying to be versatile to help our guild. It annoys the shit out of me that my ring is almost maxed on ilevel but my off spec ring is the default non upgraded one. Though with 10 months of WoD left I'll have plenty of time to upgrade the os one too, but this shit should have been thought of before this.</div></div><hr />

He's right though. I don't raid, but I'll still have to grind the holy artefact and the retri artefact, or I won't even be able to do the world objectives/dailies/whatever properly. Doing IQD dailies as holy was anything but fun. And since we won't have any other weapons dropping...<br />

What about the healing specs who have to actually go outside of 5-mans and raids to kill monsters? At least tank specs can perform somewhat well in killing world mobs (especially the DKs). Pallies (and to lesser extent druids and shamans) are getting screwed. As usual, I might add.</div></div><hr />

So she's 'probably' going to be the only character I will put effort into both artifact weapons. <br />
<br />
I like what they are saying in trying to make the specs feel more fantasy based, because they should do, it's a fantasy game. Even warriors should feel like unstoppable juggernauts of impossible strength so that it feels more like a fantasy character and not some guy on steroids. <br />
<br />

<br />
Doing the legion equivalent of my offspec being a few item lvls lower than my main spec, until I max out my main spec is alot better than waiting until all the other people who need my offspec weapon for their main and THEN fighting all the offspecers for it.<br />
<br />
you are complainging about ease of access vs no guaranteed access at all, and dont even know how its going to work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shudder has a point, here's the simple way to think about it. Little Billy is one of the raids tanks but he has homework to do/kid's sick/cat's on fire/family emergency/real life happened on a progression a mythic raid night. Now little Sally has a tanking offspec since you know the whole dual spec system. She's been getting the tanks sloppy seconds and has enough gear so the OT can go MT and she can OT and they toss a standby in for DPS. <br />
<br />
Now since the DPS has been concentrating on thier DPS artifact and Healing and Tanking on thiers no one can replace the Tank for a progression fight so. &quot;Sorry 19 other people go do something else&quot;<br />
<br />
Same thing can be said for throwing in subs or having people switch to alts.<br />

<br />
I believe when I was watching the interview of a Blizzard PvP guy by Bajheera they mentioned that there was not going to be PvP gear in the sense of what it is currently like dual ilvl, or the resilience fiasco. I got the impression though that you will be able to get gear but it will be like gear obtained through PvE. Doing this would mean someone that likes to exclusively PvP won't be forced to PvE and that there will be no PvP or PvE gear just gear that might look different or not who knows.<br />
<br />
This is just an interpretation of what I heard, so please take this with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps the weapons should each have to be initially acquired, but then level like a single item that switches specs with you. You could set the points per spec. I don't mean to sound lazy, but I can see this being a real pain in the future.<br />
<br />
First off that is your choice to maintain 2 or 3 alts for raid and is by no means 100% needed to complete the raiding content. I can understand everyone wanting to play the dps spec that is the strongest to make the raid easier or succeed. You can easily right now take the worse dps spec and worse healing spec and worse tank spec right now and still complete all of the endgame raid content. It make take you 10-15% longer to complete that content. Blizzard should not take away endgame content or make it easier to burn through just because you want to go hardcore and maintain 2 or 3 alts or always play the highest performing dps spec your class has at the moment. That is the problem now with the game is raiders want to burn through all the content in 3 or 4 weeks then do pretty much nothing until the next raid tier comes out. Love the look of Legion keep up the great work Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shudder has a point, here's the simple way to think about it. Little Billy is one of the raids tanks but he has homework to do/kid's sick/cat's on fire/family emergency/real life happened on a progression a mythic raid night. Now little Sally has a tanking offspec since you know the whole dual spec system. She's been getting the tanks sloppy seconds and has enough gear so the OT can go MT and she can OT and they toss a standby in for DPS. <br />
<br />
Now since the DPS has been concentrating on thier DPS artifact and Healing and Tanking on thiers no one can replace the Tank for a progression fight so. &quot;Sorry 19 other people go do something else&quot;<br />
<br />
Same thing can be said for throwing in subs or having people switch to alts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Talk about nerd raging and that irony...it's cute.<br />
Well if you would have listened they said that it would be easy to have a maxed out main spec artifact weapon and the off spec artifact weapon slight behind, however it would take effort to keep them both maxed out. It would be no different for little Sally now to tank with a weapon that is 15%-30% behind what the Little Billy tank weapon is now. Anytime a Tank fills in or a heals fills in their gear is never up to the same standard as the core tank or heals when on a progression fight. It will be no different that it is right now.<br />

This may be true, but pures can go outside and do open-world content with the spec they already have an artefact for. Tank specs can quest as tank to a various degree of success.</div></div><hr />

That's significant because it suggests we can accumulate points and use them when we choose. If you get points from quests, dungeons, PvP, and raids, then it won't be hard to maintain both. Make a goal for yourself. If an upgrade is 500 points, then every other upgrade you do goes to your offspec. Or every third upgrade. Or have quests, raids, and dungeons go to your main spec and PvP and LFR go to your offspec.<br />
<br />
It's a game of priority. I always prioritize my DPS spec on my tanks and healers while leveling and start to switch to my tank/healing specs close to max level. Now with personal loot, I swap between which I prioritize on a given boss.<br />
<br />
Blizzard wants players to slow down, yet when they do try to slow people down, people whine they can't go fast enough. Perhaps it's time you learn how to prioritize. Pick what's the most important and then focus on the smaller things. Focusing on everything at once is just asking for disaster. Shockingly, humans can't multitask. We can appear to do so such as watching TV, talking on the phone, and playing a game at the same time, but you really aren't. Your attention is on one thing. Try to do it and then see if you can remember what the conversation on the phone was about as well as what happened on the TV and in the game. This is why so many crash while talking on cellphones. We can't multitask. So learn to focus on one thing at a time. Nothing is so important that you NEED to have more than one max level artifact inside a month of the expansion hitting. You would LIKE to have two+ max level artifacts, but you don't NEED it. Take your time and you will EVENTUALLY get all of your artifacts maxed out. Again, Blizzard wants us to go slower. Perhaps you should slow down and smell the roses.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you should also consider why you feel you need to switch specs or classes for raiding on a regular basis. Were you asked to do this by your raid leader to fill a missing role? Did you somehow force it yourself? If you were asked to do it, then perhaps you should learn to say no so you can focus on one toon for a while. You can always recruit someone to kill the roll you once filled with an offspec/alt. If you were told to do it, then again, learn to say no and recruit someone else to fill that missing role. If you forced the issue yourself, then you need to learn to slow down and step back. You should never feel forced to do something against your will by someone else. That's peer pressure (aka bullying). Either say no or find a new guild. And if you feel forced to do it because of yourself, then you should see professional help. You don't go to a buffet and eat everything in sight because it's there, do you? Then why should you try to max out every artifact in a month because it's there? Take your time and find your limit.<br />
<br />
I was in a situation myself back in TBC where I was told to regear myself from resto to elemental on my shaman so I could raid. I said no and found a new guild which was ultimately better. I eventually left the new guild some months later and it's taken me roughly 7 years to finally find another guild to run with. I was patient and it was worth it. I don't run with dicks. I was also in a situation back in WotLK where I ran the Argent Tournament on toon after toon after toon to get the mounts. At one point, I was doing it on something like 6 toons a day because I had nothing else to do (I had quit raiding a few months prior). I found my breaking point and soon quit running the tournament. I didn't go back until last year when I only did it on 2 toons. I stepped back and figured out what I wanted to handle while still having other things to do. I'm not in a hurry to get things done. I can wait. Perhaps if you're in the race for world first, I can see the rush to maxing out an artifact on as many alts as possible, but 1% of players are in that situation. The rest of us shouldn't feel forced to do something we don't want to do. Blizzard's not forcing us. We're doing it to ourselves or to others.<br />
<br />
Besides, we know next to nothing on how fast we can even level an artifact. For all we know, we can level it to max level in a week once we hit 110 and we're diligent about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What a load of horseshit. It's like they don't understand how raiding works at all. Especially when half the fucking players come and go it's very fucking important that people are able to switch specs easily to fill in gaps. They already make it impossible now to class switch to help out your guild since you have to do lfr for 3 months to get the fucking ring. Now we'll have to do that for the legendary bracers or whatever dumb slot they choose AND have to level up a goddamn weapon.<br />

Finally, the &quot;tabards tab&quot; issue has been answered with the new Diablo III transmog system. Players have been asking about it since the Blizzcon between WotLK and Cataclysm. Devs have previously responded by saying they wanted to make a tab for tabards just like pets and mounts, but had an issue with all of the tabards that had on-use effects. I guess this new Diablo III system has finally solved it. My bank slots carrying tons of tabards thank Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I think Artifact upgrading be more like XP between levels, or reputation until honored. A very long journey to maintain interest, not a journey over in literally 15 minutes out of a 2-year expansion.<br />

<br />
When I read this, all I can imagine is a daily quest hub where we show up, do the same dailies to get some reward we're after, and once obtained, we never touch the hub again out of boredom of the quests there. What I'd love to see is this really long quest chain that takes weeks or months to do where each quest is unique (and each patch introduces more quests to do) and the rewards can be given when we've reached certain points in the chain. That means instead of farming to Exalted rep for a mount, you'd be handed the mount after completing one of the quests near the end of the quest chain. Or wherever the Blizzard team wants to put it. This would go for all rep items, like profession items, gear, toys, etc. It would all be given to you as a quest reward somewhere along the way rather than trying to farm rep. It would keep things interesting for awhile without the mindless dailies and farming. <br />
<br />
Realistically, I know this would be really hard for Blizzard to do just because players are able to tear through quests faster than Blizzard would ever be able to create them, and I definitely don't want to see those quests where it takes weeks to obtain all the items needed (e.g. legendary quests). But if they could ever introduce a long quest chain like this rather than daily hubs, that would be amazing!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't even do this for a lot of my alts.<br />
<br />
Not sure I have the writing skill needed to describe how thoroughly detached from reality statements like these are in the raiding community (Normal/Heroic/Mythic) <br />
<br />
No one even mildly competetive wants to play a sub-par spec for any given encounter. I'm only talking raiding here not other content just as a disclaimer. For example, I love Demonology, and have since the overhaul in MoP. Thankfully I got to play as a Demo lock for most of MoP and the first half of WoD - a LONG time in WoW terms. For HFC though, not only was the spec gutted (semantics sure, but I don't know how to describe nerfs of 25% across the board other than gutted) but Affliction and Destro proved to be very good on different fights. I switch as needed by how well I do with each. I tried to brute force affliction on every fight but it just wasn't happening. <br />
<br />
Now unless:<br />
Blizzard balances around the utopian ideal that all specs and classes can perform equally in all situations. Never before attained in any game with diverse classes in the history of gaming, <br />
<br />
OR<br />
<br />
Powering up a 2nd or 3rd spec Artifact weapon will take only a nominal amount of effort to equal the &quot;main&quot; spec in power so that we may switch specs (why have dual spec if one is gimped out of the box?) freely like we do today. No one will mind a little work but the way it sounds like we'll have to repeat &quot;Draenor Pathfinder&quot; for each weapon or something.</div></div><hr />

Does not matter, if they don't have control over their own code, it's just laughable, even if there's a 3 million lines of code, you have to know from what part of the code calls are being made, and they could easily write a debugger to specifically search for that part of code. I believe it's more on the &quot;well yeah we can always add bigger bags, so let's not bother re-writing that fragmented piece of old code&quot; <br />
<br />
as said, they should hire some code crackers or true assembly writers and if it's really fragmented to a point of clusterfuck proportions, they will find it in no time, but as said, I don't believe they don't know where it is, but their old code is just garbage to mess around with and if you try to fix one thing it will impact something completely else, so they code around it as much as they can, because that's what happens when you get tons of programmers to write at the same code through years without coding guidlines and comments. <br />
<br />
And if that's the case, it's just sad, it could happen at any day that this whole code base collapses on them and makes everything not work at all.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like you've never done work on a 15-year old codebase.</div></div><hr />

Not on one that rakes in multi millions a month no. I worked on one that makes about 50k a month and it was a mess to a point where a re-write was more convenient.</div></div><hr />
