Legion - Azshara<br />
We found some interesting references to Azshara. Unfortunately there isn't much more than what is below yet. Keep in mind that this is just a reference in an alpha build of Legion, not something final or officially announced. Spoilers below!<br />
<br />
Azsuna - &quot;Ten Thousand Years Ago&quot; - The Council at Val'Sharah<br />
Senegos: Ten thousand years ago, I found myself mixed up with a rebel alliance of sorts.<br />
Senegos: This was during the pinnacle of Queen Azshara's power over the elves. Her abuse of magic had grown dangerously strong.<br />
Senegos: We plotted to use the Tidestone of Golganneth against the queen.<br />
<br />
Senegos: Cenarius. I can wield the Tidestone, but I must warn you: we risk destroying the entire Well of Eternity!<br />
Cenarius: That, my friend, is precisely the plan.<br />
Illidan: Fah! We need simply to do away with Queen Azshara herself, not the very source of our people's power.<br />
Farondis: I agree. We are firing a cannon at sparrows.<br />
Tyrande: We are fighting the greatest danger our world has ever seen!<br />
Tyrande: Even now, Queen Azshara colludes with demons. She puts our world at risk.<br />
Cenarius: Very well. Prince Farondis, you can secure the Tidestone of Golganneth?<br />
Farondis: I shall have it arranged, Cenarius.<br />
<br />
Azsuna - &quot;The Fate of Nar'thalas&quot; - Memory Scene<br />
Attendant: Here it is, my Prince: The Tidestone of Golganneth, one of the seven Stones of Creation, and treasured relic of the kaldorei.<br />
Farondis: Very good. Leave me.<br />
* Attendant leaves.<br />
Farondis: I'm sorry, Cenarius. I believed in your cause, but I couldn't bring myself to turn against...<br />
* Azshara enters.<br />
* Farondis kneels before Azshara.<br />
Farondis: My queen.<br />
Azshara: You've done me a great service today, Farondis.<br />
Azshara: What a shame that you won't LIVE to reap the benefits of my gratitude.<br />
Farondis: ...what?!<br />
Azshara: This whole valley is filled with plotters and schemers.<br />
Azshara: Cavorting with Cenarius behind my back? I will NOT tolerate dissent!<br />
Azshara: You must all be taught a lesson.<br />
* Azshara uses lightning to blow up the Tidestone.<br />

Legion - Artifact Tweets<br />
The Holy Paladin Artifact weapon (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5404-Holy-Paladin-Artifact-Weapon-Preview-Tweets-Activision-Blizzard-and-MLG-Fan-Art) we recently previewed is intended to be fairly large. <br />

Legion - Artifact Weapon Previews<br />
Today we have the Restoration Shaman Artifact Scepter of Azshara (beta.wowdb.com/items/128911-scepter-of-azshara). Some of the shields are missing or incorrect, so don't worry if they look somewhat off or are missing. <br />

My main has been hunter for years. With all the spell removals why does Feed Pet still exist? Pet loyalty is gone.<br />
In this case, it has no impact on keybindings, and minimal potential confusion, so is kept purely for flavor. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/684526595051106304))<br />

Remove Curse for Mages _increases_ class fantasy, yet it's being removed, whats the reasoning there?<br />
Removing Curses is not really part of the iconic Warcraft Mage fantasy, and didn’t fit the desired gameplay. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/684529183427461120))<br />

Any plans to be able to glyph out the pistol for throwing axes/knives or similar, for the others?<br />
Not currently, though it’s something we'll consider! Primary focus is on creating a strong core fantasy for Outlaws. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/684525445958651905))<br />
<br />
with so much CC stripped away are we going to just be tunneling damage into each other? HOW BORING<br />
CC overall is being reduced. Blind was removed as Subtlety's rotation now includes Cheap Shot. Extremely strong. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/684524931107827712))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
of the 3 possibilities you mentioned (https://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler/answers/135754035339)-incompetent, overworked, lazy- how often is at least 1 of them a factor? i imagine 10%<br />
It's usually not lazy. At the places I have worked, devs are horrified at the thought of disappointing players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684211512253087744))<br />
So in the strictest sense, most of the mistakes we make are those of competence - we make a call that ends up being bad. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684211686669029377))<br />
But I originally meant competency in the sense that it's easy to throw colleagues under the bus if you aren't careful. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684211905808891904))<br />
Saying &quot;Our engineers couldn't find the bug&quot; out of context invites detractors to say &quot;Well, get better engineers.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684212132422926336))<br />
<br />
yeah, I'm pretty sure the Pony metaphor was about over-sharing and over-promising.<br />
Early in my career, I communicated everything but ended up sending the message that I was in over my head. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684213201823645696))<br />
<br />
Yeah, some players have a habit of arguing broken promises as a way to force your hand. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684212978548264960))<br />
Some people also REALLY have a hard time confusing with changing one's mind and when one is lying. <br />
Yeah, players should REALLY not want devs to go through with bad ideas just because they were promised. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/684214179889205248))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully they reconsider it, could at least allow the off hand to have the same appearance as the main hand. Otherwise, I foresee a lot of people just transmogging both if possible, since the skin on the main one would never match.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resto shield is...eh...alright. Better than prot warrior shield, not saying much though.<br />
<br />
In terms of GC's final quote--it's one thing to cancel a feature because it turns out to be a &quot;bad idea,&quot; but it's another thing to not have anything to replace that cut content. I think players tend to want the same &quot;amount&quot; of content, and if they see stuff cut without seeing an &quot;equal or lesser addition,&quot; (which is absurd to think about, as different teams work on different features, etc) they get mad.<br />
<br />
Case in point, in WOD, tons of cuts, very little added, and then they tried to sell us the selfie/twitter/social media patch. Were those things stuff that quest developers would be working on? No. But the false equivalence already exists in players' minds.<br />
<br />
Or, currently--we can't see much of Legion content, the release (and formal beta) were pushed way out past what was stated, and expected. So we look to what we do have: TJ and HFC for months and months, and compare it to that promise of &quot;faster expansions.&quot; There is no area of any of that where Blizzard is actually delivering, currently, though if Legion comes out amazing at least there will be that justification.</div></div><hr />

Tyrande just said she's the most powerful threat this world has ever faced, and Tyrande has fought against plenty of dangerous enemies, Old god Avatars, The Lich king, Archimonde and Kil'jaeden. She also destroyed a pillar of creation with a snap of her fingers</div></div><hr />

Sadly the player's fantasy is completely irrelevant. <br />
<br />
That really sucks that Doomhammer's lava-formed offhand can't be transmogged. Hopefully it will disappear when sheathed so players at least don't have to look at it all the time, because it really is ugly. If the devs so desperately wanted Enhancement to have Doomhammer, they should have either made 2H Enhance a thing again and made Doomhammer a two-hander, or have whatever appears in the offhand be more like a fireball or something that's thrown as part of the attack animation. <br />
The lava hammer is silly. <br />

Yet, it was still at the time where Tyrande had faced Archimonde, which is more powerful than the Lich king, and she destroyed a World pillar which are powerful enough to banish Deathwing. We all saw how deathwing was. Memory doesent neccesarily say that it was long ago</div></div><hr />

Given her Old God induced transformation since then and 10 thousand more years to hone her abilities who knows how powerful she is now.<br />
<br />
But as for Tyrande's statement on Azshara being the greatest threat the world has ever seen, reading that to me she isn't so much referring to Azshara as a lone entity but as to what Azshara was doing, consorting with the Legion, trying to summon Sargeras personally since she was crazy and thought she'd be his &quot;bride&quot; all those things.</div></div><hr />

It says it was ten thousand years ago above. Meaning right during the War of the Ancients. <br />

<br />
Failing your basic reading comprehension roll ? He is talking about the virtual offhand enh shaman will have. And that can't be tmogged without also changing the main hand weapon (in fact the main hand weapon is the only weapon enh shaman have, it's not a pair of weapon like rogues or monks).<br />
<br />
So no, you can't only tmog the ugly lava offhand.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Me too. This iconic Warcraft class fantasy is getting old to me. Not sure why. But its making it more like the developers are saying this is their game and the players don't get to decide what class XYZ is. Eh guess I'm getting old. <br />
<br />
I think the problem is that Pally A isn't the same as Pally B in Warcraft lore. But all the players Paladins are of the same mold. But... the player Paladin is the master and command of the class order? One of the most awesome Paladins in history able to weld Ashbringer... but needs 24 others to crush Mythic raid boss XYZ. <br />

Not sure why they keep wanting to do away with CC for use in PVE. Seems gone are the day of Mage sheep the star, hunter trap the square, rogue sap the triangle...... Burn the skull then the triangle.. then the. etc. <br />
<br />
Gone are the days of kiting Drak by the hunter/mage/etc while we kill the adds then release Drak back to the party... <br />
<br />
5 mans are Tank gather all.... DPS AOEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!... Healer heals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
She wouldn't have faced Archimonde her during this time. And Tyrande is referring to the demons being the greatest threat to the world not Azshara specifically.<br />
yeah.Tyrande is talking about demons,not Azshara.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well shamans are in general bad(speaking of dps specs) so they want to keep this as it is , worst dps class=must have worst looking artefacts as well... it doesn't metter if it's resto or dps...</div></div><hr />

He is talking about the virtual offhand enh shaman will have. And that can't be tmogged without also changing the main hand weapon (in fact the main hand weapon is the only weapon enh shaman have, it's not a pair of weapon like rogues or monks).<br />
<br />
So no, you can't only tmog the ugly lava offhand.<br />
<br />
You're assuming that 'any customisation' includes transmog and not just the artifact skins. Which, by the way, the original question doesn't mention transmog.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, it only says the weapon retains the 'lava like appearance', so the shape may well change.</div></div><hr />

if we go by the original WotA then he should be involved,yes,but this is the altered one so it makes sense.</div></div><hr />

Uh what? If you mean altered as in Rhonin/Krassus going back in time etc then Malf would still be involved heavily too.</div></div><hr />

yes but there was no council in Val'Sharah during that point.who knows what is Malfurion doing while they are making plans in Val'Sharah.he can't be always present.</div></div><hr />

Tyrande just said she's the most powerful threat this world has ever faced, and Tyrande has fought against plenty of dangerous enemies, Old god Avatars, The Lich king, Archimonde and Kil'jaeden. She also destroyed a pillar of creation with a snap of her fingers<br />
<br />
No, she didn't say that. She said they were fighting the most powerful threat and that they were fighting Azshara, not that Azshara alone was all there is to the most powerful threat.<br />
<br />
Destroying a pillar of creation could be a very easy thing to do, something so powerful might be unstable, volatile, - or nearly depleted after the creation. Maybe even all of those.<br />
It is possible that anything but handling it very, very carefully would have destroyed it.</div></div><hr />

I have to agree with you. I play a shaman and doomhammer can fuck right off. I'd rather have something like Drek'thar's weapons or anything not at all related to thrall. Sorry but the doomhammer? No. Just No. Not to mention I don't like being a fire wielding shaman. There's four elements, let us pick what we want to specialise in &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

Well considering what Resto Shammies get I think that Enhancement Shammies get the better looking weapon so far, will have to wait and see what the Elemental Shamans weapon is like..</div></div><hr />

<br />
yes but for prot the WEAPONS dont have more then one look, for elementle the shield is the same but the weapon has differant looks, for protection the shield has skins and the sword is just colour changes, its cause the sword/shield is just a added thing its not &quot;THE&quot; artifact its just a random item to match<br />

Me too. This iconic Warcraft class fantasy is getting old to me. Not sure why. But its making it more like the developers are saying this is their game and the players don't get to decide what class XYZ is. Eh guess I'm getting old. <br />
<br />
I think the problem is that Pally A isn't the same as Pally B in Warcraft lore. But all the players Paladins are of the same mold. But... the player Paladin is the master and command of the class order? One of the most awesome Paladins in history able to weld Ashbringer... but needs 24 others to crush Mythic raid boss XYZ. <br />
<br />

<br />
needs 24 others to do a mythic boss &gt;_&gt; umm you mean 19 others? also &quot;lore wise&quot; there is one &quot;artifact hero&quot; per class (we will see in legion)<br />
<br />
so lore wise its a raid of the paladin weidling one of the artifacts, the warlock, the demon hunter, the mage, the warrior, etc, so yeah, lore wise its a raid of 12 people, one of each class, the leader of their class, taking on the enemy<br />
<br />
No more CC? wow you REALLY havent done mythic raiding have you :P<br />
gone are the days of kiting because kiting orignaly was more of a game bug cause enemies couldent move and auto attack at the same time<br />
gather all stuff and aoe, has allways been a thing, just once you got enough gear that became the fastest way, there is plenty of times like mythic dugeons or challenge modes where you cant just &quot;gather stuff and AOE&quot;<br />
