Wrath of the Lich King Release on November 13 - Additional Info<br />

As I said in the original post :<br />
We're now 2 months away from Wrath of the Lich King<br />
Patch 3.0.2 will probably be deployed on live servers very soon, probably in mid october. <br />
The game will be in stores on November 13 in North America, Europe, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Russia, and on November 14 in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia. The expansion will be available in Korea and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau on November 18, and the launch timing for China will be announced at a later date.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
In the frozen wastes of the north, the Lich King Arthas Menethil rallies his undead army and schemes to bring an end to all life on Azeroth -- and in a couple of months, you'll begin your epic journey into Northrend to confront the Lich King and his minions yourself. Blizzard Entertainment's second expansion to World of Warcraft -- Wrath of the Lich King -- will be in stores on November 13 in North America, Europe, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, and Russia, and on November 14 in Australia, New Zealand, Thailand, Singapore, and Malaysia. The expansion will be available in Korea and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau on November 18, and the launch timing for China will be announced at a later date. For more information, read the press release or visit the Wrath of the Lich King website. <br />

None of us said &quot;omg this is fake&quot; or anything like that. We merely said it was unofficial. Until Blizz said themselves that &quot;hey guys, it's out on November 13th!&quot;, it still was not official.</div></div><hr />

More like they've dealt out content like potatoes during the Irish famine and now they're (recklessly) kicking things into high gear when actual competition starts to rear its ugly head.<br />

<br />
It's still 2 months away, and the game has only been in beta for 2 months. And let me say that things have improved A LOT since the intial beta.<br />
<br />
Blizzard will hit the date with a well-polished game as usual. And since it's an MMO Blizzard can work on fixing things until 11:59PM on November 12th. We're going to download a patch no matter what. As long as the CD's have the majority of the content in it (keeping patch sizes small) things are fine.</div></div><hr />

WAR is in no way 'bad.' It pretty much delivers what it promised... a highly PvP oriented MMO. I played WAR in the PW, PW+ and OB and had nothing but fun with it.<br />
<br />
Does it have the depth of WoW? No, not at all.<br />
<br />
But it handles PvP better than WoW by leaps and bounds.</div></div><hr />

Good. Then maybe all the PvP'ers from WoW can go over to WAR and we can stop having our classes tuned to handle PVP and hurt PVE</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They tuned the classes for Arena instead of mass-scale PvP. WAR doesn't do Arena style PvP... it goes mass-scale PvP... It actually has tanks as obstacles in PvP and in their equivalent of battlegrounds, you don't find yourself stuck on guarding a flag just to avoid a ninja, spending a majority of the game doing nothing because no one else will 'defend.'<br />
<br />
If you dislike WoW class tuning, blame Arena, not PvP in general.</div></div><hr />

I'd pay the money WITHOUT the pet. The 208 page art book and soundtrack pretty much covers that extra $30 for me, but then again I buy a LOT of game soundtracks...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You have no idea how long they have been working on WotLK so you can't assume they are just ~now~ kicking it into high gear with content. <br />
<br />
The fact that they are choosing this time to announce things like this is a wise business decision, like having an ace up your sleeve. I bet they have been planning this sort of thing ever since warhammer was announced as a 2008 release.<br />
<br />
and the fact that you assume that blizzard is a company that would wrecklessly do things, then you obviously have no clue what is going on.<br />
<br />
bottom line is Blizzard doesnt want to lose any players, be it PVP or PVE players, and they will do anything to keep their customers hooked.<br />
<br />
thats not a bad thing btw.</div></div><hr />

Why is getting it on dvd considered a feature. If you don't own a dvd drive in this day and age you should go and kill yourself, right now.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2008-09-16, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They tuned the classes for Arena instead of mass-scale PvP. WAR doesn't do Arena style PvP... it goes mass-scale PvP... It actually has tanks as obstacles in PvP and in their equivalent of battlegrounds, you don't find yourself stuck on guarding a flag just to avoid a ninja, spending a majority of the game doing nothing because no one else will 'defend.'<br />
<br />
If you dislike WoW class tuning, blame Arena, not PvP in general.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ever heard of lake wintergrasp?<br />
<br />
I said it before, AoC has &quot;mass-scale PVP&quot; too. And look how that worked out.<br />
<br />
You can't say anything about how good their &quot;mass scale&quot; pvp is going to be until you see how their servers will handle it.<br />
<br />
And the graphics are still awful. Why couldn't they just fix those when they brought the game back from beta to alpha?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jajaja</div><div class="date">2008-09-16, 07:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i wont bother ordering this expansion, because i cancelled my account. i did 2 years of WoW (PVP and PVE). it was getting to old on graphics, gameplay, and gear after gear, nothing new.<br />
<br />
and the beta of Woltk is olso nothing new to me you will get bored in 2 weeks , just some new sprites skills gear and a new &quot;boss&quot; etc and again nothing new thats revolutionary.<br />
think about it.<br />
<br />
so im gonna play WAR, for me its &quot;The WoW killer&quot; alot of new pvp content, refreshing, and something NEW!<br />

It's not a FEATURE, it's the exact description of what the box CONTAINS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The expansion isn't complete. I have a feeling they are holding back on quite a few of the really cool armor sets and graphics. They will probably reuse some armor models for the non-tier gear as well as the gear that's not quite as fancy. It was stated in a blizzcast that the Tier gear from 25 mans might have more particle effects or something then the 10 man stuff. They probably just have not implemented this. People really want to see the armor and it will probably go into the game files towards the end. You know how everyone goes nuts over the Tier gear look. Maybe they are holding back this time around a bit longer. Also here is a link to an outline of important stuff from the blizzcast I was referring to.<br />
