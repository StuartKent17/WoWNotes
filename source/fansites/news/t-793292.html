Stood in the Fire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5518/stood-in-the-fire/) Feat of Strength<br />
It'll be virtually impossible to predict when and where he'll show up. Deathwing does what he wants. Waiting in a random zone for him to show up is not going to be very effective. It could literally take days for him to hit the zone you're in. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/134405/deathwing-feat-of-strength-for-dying))<br />

Onyxian Whelpling<br />
It was a pet rewarded to any characters that logged on during the 5th year anniversary. While some special pets are account-wide and mailed on new character creation, the Onyxian Whelpling was not one of them.

Horn of Winter<br />
The behavior you're describing is the result of a bug which will be fixed in the next patch prior to the release of Cataclysm. You will again be able to toot your own horn to gain runic power, you just won't get the Attack Power benefit if a similar buff is already present.

Loads of new achieves are there, not sure how much of them you can do.<br />

Hmm. I only use Dalaran to get the hell out of Dalaran... It's way too much of a lagfest for me. Usually if I participate in Wintergrasp, then want to get to org, my only way is to fly to dal, then port to org... Now I'm going to be stuck in Northrend, and have to fly all the way out to Borean Tundra/Howling Fjord and catch the zeppelin? -.-<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind if they changed it with Cata, when I would never go to WG again, but for the next 3 weeks I'll still be going... Then now I'm going to be getting stuck. -.-</div></div><hr />

<br />
Basically you have to be &quot;fortunate&quot; enough to be questing/exploring a zone when Deathwing decides to do a little landscaping. Then it's a matter of being in the line of fire as he nukes. From what I heard, he emote a zone wide /yell to warn us he is coming.<br />
<br />
As for missing out on the achievement, you will have plenty of chances. He will keep doing this in a random zone until he is killed in the game story, which won't be for quite a while.</div></div><hr />

All the Cata achievements are in. Just pop on the PTR to see. I'm not sure how many you can do without the Cata content, though. Maybe fishing? :D<br />

pushing back archeology to cata? its not just me, it was coming before like inscription yes?<br />

On the plus side, I assume I can get Archaelogy as soon as I buy Cata? So I guess I have something to do for the 3 hours before I can start leveling &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

Fishing daily were already in early beta (begining of september).<br />
There was one :<br />
- kill a deer in Azashara for its eye<br />
- use an eye as lure<br />
- catch carp in Orgrimmars waters, near taurens district</div></div><hr />

I know they were. But if you make a premade, you won't have the fishing skill and so need to learn it before being able to pick up the fishing daily. My point was that if the other person created a premade, it might not have fishing and so couldn't see the daily.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sure it does. It takes the time between the Shattering and the Cataclysm release for the faction leaders to decide that the ground is just far too treacherous and different for their warriors to traverse on foot. So that's when they allow the heroes of Azeroth the ability to purchase flight licenses.<br />
<br />
On a more technical note, the only way to reach most of the new 80+ zones is to be ported in or to fly over something to get there. The exceptions being Uldum, which there'll probably be a door in the way, and I think the Twilight Highlands, which will probably have a barricade.</div></div><hr />

The removal of portals in Dalaran is going to be a big pain-in-the-butt since we'll still be engaged in Northrend activies. It makes more sense once we're all back in Azeroth doing the 81-85 zones. Then again, if Dalaran gains an AH then I guess there isn't too much reason to go back to old world capitols just yet.</div></div><hr />

Look at Boub's post (ya know, the one you had to scroll past to post that comment). Right at the top it tells you exactly what is and is not in the patch.<br />

It doesn't make sense either way, we've had flying mounts since BC and now suddenly we learn to fly them in Azeroth? Dunno why the world changing has anything to do with us learning to fly. It's one of the selling points of Cataclysm, like archaeology.</div></div><hr />

Still, why remove them now? I still hang out in Dalaran for ICC, VoA, and the weekly raids. So, now, when Cataclysm drops, I have to fly to Valliance Keep to catch a boat to head back to Stormwind.

That's not true, they are in. But if you haven't bought Cataclysm you get teleported out of them again if you enter. Hop in the water south of Tanaris and swim around to Uldum, you can look into the zone - which looks fantastic btw.</div></div><hr />

What time frame? When it was first announced they said he would randomly be going over zones until he is first defeated.

They removed all class-specific quests - you can pick up the Paladin quest chain - but you can't complete it because the quest disappears if you enter the dungeon you need to do to finish it. GOD FORBID they let you do a fucking quest chain you can pick up.</div></div><hr />

I wish they put a neutral AH in both those cities. Since they are main resting towns for 2 expansions now. It will boost up cross fraction AH translations by a lot. If your on a low pop for your side you might find the same item cheaper from the other side.</div></div><hr />

If you have the item for the onyxian whelpling, but never USED it, the item itself is BoA, so you can still give it away if you want. It just disappears on use.<br />
<br />
I don't think that's entireley accurate.<br />
The onyxian whelpling does not disappear on use, at least not for me.<br />
Yes it is BoA though.<br />
My bank character has one and i trade it to every alt i make, learn the whelpling, and then trade it back to my bank toon.</div></div><hr />

Dunno why the world changing has anything to do with us learning to fly. It's one of the selling points of Cataclysm, like archaeology.<br />
<br />
So would be the new class combinations but they are offering that to us now. They could have also offered to us flying.</div></div><hr />
