Blue Posts<br />
Forum Mods<br />
Learning time about Blizzard Community teams! There's a difference between Community Managers and Forum Moderators.<br />
<br />
CMs are part of the regional Community teams, and are generally here as a representative to and from the development team, etc.<br />
<br />
Forum Moderators are part of our Customer Support team, and are generally here to moderate the forums, delete threads, edit posts, etc.<br />
<br />
Just for some clarity: I'm the Community Manager for WoW in North America - and there are a number of moderators in the shadows at all times, just like our in-game GMs!<br />
<br />
From the CM side: You may occasionally see Lore or Kaivax popping in and out, especially on the PTR and Class Development forums, as they are handling some more broad-scope, less region-specific Community operations now. And I have Aeridel and Rythmor assisting me here on the forums if I'm ever out of the office, but they handle Social Media and Relationships, respectively, as their main functions. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20757667239?page=1#11))<br />

This is great, except I don't understand the bit about it not going live until a realm restart. Does this imply that the fix isn't going to get applied until the event is over anyway?</div></div><hr />

Both EU and the US had realm restarts this morning, so the fix should be live now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got booted out of game during the Illidan fight last night. Game wouldn't let me back in even though internet was fine. Did the whole instance and didn't get the last fight done. About an hour later the game let me back in and I couldn't join another group b/c I have a lockout with every boss but Illidan. When I joined them it wouldn't let the raid leader queue for the event. Once I left they were fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well what were you expecting? More StarCraft, Diablo and World of Warcraft which have been all the life of Blizzard for the past decades on all the conventions and Blizzcon?<br />
<br />
Overwatch is a new IP which is still growing, is normal they are giving it a first row seat for these things.</div></div><hr />

It's not like you can't shape the brim... Something baseball players have been doing for decades.</div></div><hr />

That's understandable, since Overwatch is their biggest game by far.</div></div><hr />
