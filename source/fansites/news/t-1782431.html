Patch 6.2 - Apexis Crystal Gear for Gold<br />
Patch 6.2 will change the Apexis Crystal gear prices to gold rather than Apexis Crystals. Gearing up alts will be easier, but not cheap! Each item level 675 item is 20,000 gold, so it will cost you 120,000 gold for all 6 slots. Hellfire Citadel Normal loot ranges from item level 690 to 705 depending on the boss / item. <br />
<br />
As always, keep in mind that PTR prices are not final until they are live.<br />

Patch 6.2 - Skip Mission Complete Animations<br />
If you aren't using Master Plan (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/master-plan) and still doing missions manually for some reason, Patch 6.2 adds a nice way to skip the Mission Complete animations from garrison missions! <br />

Character / Items<br />
What ever happened to the Frostwolf cosmetic armor (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/frostwolfClan.jpg)?<br />
We have no plans to make this available to players at this time. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/596485202412572672))<br />
<br />
Will Felblight (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127759-felblight) be purchasable with primal spirits?<br />
Nope. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/596485416129204224))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
I wish dungeon finder would auto switch you to your desired role like it does in battlegrounds. @WarcraftDevs<br />
Great suggestion, thanks! (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/596484192344547328))<br />
<br />
Will the Mythic Dungeons have new mechanics, or will they be a scaled up version of the Heroic mode?<br />
Current PTR state isn't final. They’ll be like scaled up versions of Challenge mode w/ mechanics changes from Heroic accordingly. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/596768625450569728))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Will the new seals be available from Level 3 War Mills?<br />
Yes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/596769235122008064))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
are you all going to do a watercoooler for the next patch?<br />
There are several more blogs in the works that will dig into specific patch features in more depth. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/596769713960550400))<br />
<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Subscriber Loss Interview<br />
Very curious as to your take on Watcher's interview yesterday.<br />
I do think / know the challenges of creating content faster than players can consume it are very real. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599279937002975233))<br />
If I was going to make an MMO (I'm not) I think I'd shoot for something episodic with the expectation players come and go. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599280079118536704))<br />
Do you think &quot;it's cyclical&quot; is a good or even fair way to summate it tho?<br />
Yes. Players come for content and leave when they run out. &quot;But I should never run out of content,&quot; feels unrealistic to me. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599302773708967936))<br />
Neverending content leads to making things so difficult you can't progress or asking you to run the same content 100 times. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599303016043261952))<br />
Is there something to be said for the staying power of the content? Or implementing it in a way that allows for a medium?<br />
If there were 40 boss raids, maybe. I get tired of killing the same ones over and over no matter how great they are. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599349431482191872))<br />
How does the social aspect play into that, though? Sounds like it would be hell on guilds.<br />
I agree, but I think players are episodic already so the business model might as well be. Social hard either way. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599364332313411585))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
If the WoW devs read this, how likely would it be for them to agree? http://t.co/CIM3r2TTrL<br />
I never felt like all classes had to be equal in all things. Can't someone just be better at burst AE? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/583626592942854144))<br />
<br />
Does Blizzard worry most about dps balance as raid tiers open, and not that much about balance as ppl start farming the tier?<br />
Can't speak for it now, but when I was there, we worried more about new content than farmed content balance. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/585448963949531136))<br />
The idea being that a low performing spec might get sat on a new boss, but unlikely when stuff was on farm. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/585449120690675712))<br />
At some point we as a community started worrying about an individual's &quot;right&quot; to high DPS rather than the DPS of the entire raid. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/585449455320604673))<br />
Rather than &quot;Did we beat the boss?&quot; it became &quot;Did I beat my warlock friend?&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/585449618189615105))<br />
<br />
by the way, I cannot even begin to fathom how hard balancing scaling in MMORPGs is.<br />
Balancing *scaling* isn't hard. Balancing classes overall is pretty hard. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/590979851516936192))<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
than blizzard can produce it. Its a design flaw that began in Woltk when took over<br />
Nah, remember I'm the guy who always rails against lowering the barrier of entry too low. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/596127234051608576))<br />
well then I stand corrected mr street<br />
NP. I still get shit for my &quot;Dungeons should be hard&quot; blog. But I still feel that way. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/596304870665138177))<br />
man do I miss hard dungeons<br />
The challenge is can't just make hard dungeons and call it a day. You need content for everyone else too. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/596407765527973889))<br />
I'm not convinced asking everyone to master hard dungeons or making easier versions of them is the way to go. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/596408007946276865))<br />
And to clarify, I am criticizing my own work, not armchair quarterbacking my old employer. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/596408246677549056))<br />
<br />
Developer Communication<br />
things don't feel the same at WoW without you. You were easily The best communicator Blizzard had.<br />
If my legacy in this industry ends up being communication with players, I will gratefully take it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/591712615568543744))<br />
<br />
WoW and LoL have been huge in my life. Ty for involvement in both and taking a lot of flack from community during each.<br />
.I'm happy to do it. I think players have a right to communication from developers. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/598498995804057603))<br />
I think &quot;right&quot; is a bit strong. I agree it's important, but sometimes it gets the developer threatened, not cool.<br />
Well I think devs have a right not to be treated like shit too! (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/598541003549593600))<br />
The issue when the two come to a head. Taking your ball home vs. &quot;Deal with it&quot;. Something I struggle w/ as a dev.<br />
I tried the head on a pike strategy somewhat, never with very good results. Mostly I ignore the haters. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/598652652382093312))<br />
<br />
Game Design<br />
Greg, what does &quot;accessibility&quot; mean in terms of MMO's and WoW in particular?<br />
I use it to mean how easily it is for someone to pick up and learn the game. It is a new player term not a casual raider term. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/595764656381255680))<br />
<br />
you once referred to the Mechanar syndrome. Do you think giving players the fastest route is worse than them finding it.<br />
If you're talking about each player discovering what's most efficient for themselves, man that's the holy grail for WoW or LoL (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/596302986420232192))<br />
Not sure there is much distinction bc only a very few players get the joy of discovery and then the others just follow them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/596302711827501056))<br />
<br />
Unannounced Feature<br />
Is the recently announced &quot;Timewalking&quot; WoW feature the one you said you were looking forward to in an interview long ago? <br />
We had talked about Timewalking before we delayed it. It wasn't super secret IIRC. I don't know the status of the other feature. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/589483984272302080))<br />
<br />
Riot<br />
You haven't gotten a new marine animal-type name now that you're at Riot?<br />
Players and Rioters kept calling me Ghostcrawler so it seemed silly to try and change it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/588537254726934528))<br />
<br />
Do you think you would ever return to Blizzard if something happened at riot games or any other reason?<br />
I wouldn't rule it out. I mean I parted on good terms and everything. But I am very happy at Riot and believe in our future. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/580500893310799872))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
I have to say: After years of undeserved bashing you are now a hero at WoW foruns. Quite a turn. <br />
The circle is complete. I just followed in the footsteps of Tigole and Kalgan. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/583030388160774144))<br />
Everyone and their mother said you were killing the game when you were here Now you're not and they all love you<br />
It's almost as if players assume games are made by those few people whose names they know. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/587357773999902720))<br />
<br />
From hate to love: more forum nonsense http://t.co/YdgSoej6gd<br />
Spoiler: I hired both and and for good reason. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/587287307801067520))<br />
Can &quot;lackluster&quot; and &quot;abysmal&quot; be the new &quot;clunky&quot; and &quot;undertuned&quot;?<br />
I was always a fan of &quot;gutted&quot; as the hyperbolic term for nerfed. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/587771951545888768))<br />
<br />
Do you still play any Blizz games btw?<br />
I am taking a break from WoW. I like Diablo and will play the SC expansion. HS was never my thing. I love Overwatch. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/581211309246545920))<br />
that's really cool! I hope the &quot;one never quits wow but merely takes breaks&quot; is true for you too <br />
We'll see. I realize now I neglected a lot of good games in order to laser focus on WoW (and these days I play a lot of LoL too). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/590937936331345920))<br />
So many games these days (ours included) really ask players to invest tons of time. It's hard to play as many games total. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/590938112391454721))<br />
<br />
anyway my Mage friend Arthox is telling me every day how much he misses you and refuses to believe you play Holy Priest <br />
I played Disc before it was cool and tried to stubbornly go back to it when it was (even though it was largely my fault). (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/590958637079666688))<br />
Tried to stubbornly NOT go back to it. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/590958727752122369))<br />
<br />
Still trying to be lovingly crusty and sarcastic without drifting into cynical and burned out. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/585505242504155139))<br />
That explains MoP<br />
I loved MoP but I think we overestimated how many people loved Pandaren. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/585506594458316801))<br />

Community Spotlight - Chaoyuan Xu<br />
This week, we’ve cast the spotlight onto Chaoyuan Xu, who has been creating excellent Warcraft-themed art for quite some time. Yuan recently sent us the pieces you see below, and he also provided answers to our questions.<br />
<br />
Q: What influences the designs of your artwork?<br />
A: I really love World of Warcraft, with all its gameplay and the design. I especially love the exploration of the game, as it involves a lot of adventure and story - which I very much enjoy. It enhances the experience of roleplaying, and this is something that other games lack. As you can see, several of my pieces focus on Pandaria - the continent I love the most - with races like blood elf or dwarf dressing in pandaren-style clothes.<br />
<br />
Q: What sort of gamer are you?<br />
A: In general, I am more of a PvE gamer, and as you can see most of my works are focused on the world. Even &quot;Martial Competition&quot; was done as a &quot;friendly duel&quot; sort of mood, rather than fighting to death. (In a way, it fits the pandaren's life philosophy!)<br />
<br />
Q: About how long does it take to create something like these?<br />
A: It depends on how much detail I want to go with the piece. For example, it took me one full week to work and finish &quot;Martial Competition.&quot;<br />
<br />
Q: What is your process?<br />
A: First is brainstorming and drawing the concept. I need to envision how the finished art would look in my brain. And then I start working on the sketch - a lot of changes might happen during this step and sometimes it's the hardest part of creating an art piece. After I think the sketch has met my standards, I start working on the details, including color, background, and lighting.<br />
<br />
Q: What other works inspire you?<br />
A: I like Assassin's Creed, Game of Thrones, and the animation of Studio Gibli. I enjoy different games and movies. No matter what kinds of style the artwork is, I reinvigorate my innovation with whatever I learn and see.<br />
<br />
Q: What do you like to do in-game?<br />
A: I enjoy exploring the world the most. I love how the Warcraft team built the world with all their innovation and creative minds. The astonishing landscape and environment we see in game is just fantastic and really inspiring. Sometimes, I dream of living there.<br />
<br />
Q: If you could add one thing to the game, artistically, what would it be?<br />
A: I'd like to add an NPC (probably a pandaren) to the game, and he would give you a daily quest to ask to take photos around the world for him so that he could finish his great masterpiece of drawing scenes for Azeroth!<br />
<br />

Thanks goes to Yuan (http://chaoyuanxu.deviantart.com/) from all of us at Blizzard for sharing his talents with us. If you’ve seen a great piece of fan art lately, e-mail us at fanart@blizzard.com and tell us all about it.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard and their incredible bullshit goldsinks on everything now a days. Oh, you want a mount? 150,000g to this vendor! Oh you want that one piece of gear replaced with something decent to BRF Normal/heroic? 20,000g! Your faction lost a mount contest? 100,000g for you! -_-....</div></div><hr />

Also LOL to the new gold sink. 120000 for 6 pieces of 675 gear? yea ok. At this point you can buy a full heroic run for that much ( even less) with full gear drops. Higher ilvl, more pieces, cheaper. RIP logic.</div></div><hr />

For every vendor that sells something for 20k gold that's $5 in their pocket. They'll continue to do this bullshit. They fucking sit there and whine about dungeons not being relevant yet can't fucking put in a badge system that we can grind dungeons daily to buy shit like this gear or mounts.

But there will never be a time when a token would drop 10k that much in order for that to happen. Tokens get bought up fast, so it's highly unlikely that this scenario is possible.<br />

They never fluctuate more than 2k either way nowadays(23k seems about avg) anyways.</div></div><hr />

Sure if you ignore the fact that all those Apexis gear have been available for 0 gold for the last few months and this is a way for people with established mains that can relatively easily get gold, to quickly gear up alts without having to spend weeks doing dailies.<br />

If that's true, that is the most insane line of reasoning I've ever heard. It's already questionably worthwhile to do highmaul on normal because of the difficulty of finding a group to do it relative to just queueing up for lfr, and right now it could still be technically called relevant since we're still in that raid tier. The only things you can't get from lfr right now are a second trinket and a second ring, and the ring is kind of irrelevant because of the legendary. Next tier there will be no reason to do it at all, even if they don't increase the item level of lfr gear. I really hope it's some kind of mistake and not an intentional strategy.</div></div><hr />

there is a difference in a 3rd party site selling gold then blizzard it self mate, now selling and buying gold is used to open arms meaning you can buy and sell your way to the top, and if you think there is skill in this game now, your a joke. with each passing patch blizzard removes more and more skills making wow a easy roll over to play.<br />
<br />
Just sad when we have players so blind to what is going on to there game, you pay X$$ to pat for a new X-pack to get less and less content patch's, yet paying the same Y$$ in months sub fees.

Your chicken little scenario might have a chance of coming true if it wasn't for the fact the Apexis gear was always considered garbage. Stop looking at the price for a second and look at what they slapped on the gear for stats. <br />

People think because they're making Apexis gear bought with gold and the introduction to WoW tokens, they can buy their way to win.. lol<br />
<br />
When, A - That gear is already outdated on most people's played characters <br />
And, B - You could've already bought gold from Gold websites long before the token came out<br />
<br />
Plus gear don't make you win anything</div></div><hr />

For u knobheads yelling P2W, P2W means u can buy stuff that makes u stronger than u can get in game, buying an passive buff from store that gives u +5% dmg/HP would be P2W, buying gear thats lower than normal Hellfire is not P2W lol</div></div><hr />

Blizzard and their incredible bullshit goldsinks on everything now a days. Oh, you want a mount? 150,000g to this vendor! Oh you want that one piece of gear replaced with something decent to BRF Normal/heroic? 20,000g! Your faction lost a mount contest? 100,000g for you! -_-....<br />
<br />
Not to mention Garrisons in general, oh you want to make an Alt? Well, you know how you bought 30k in Blueprints on your main? Do it again. It just feels like something that should be Account-Wide. <br />
<br />
Overall, those prices are insane both from a Gold and Apexis perspective. Timeless Isles was farmable in about an hour on a new character to get a full set of gear for your alts that would allow you to raid, but the gear was massively inferior to raid gear. This is basically the same, inferior gear that gets you into HFC and then it will be replaced. So this time it is either a gigantic amount of Apexis or 120k gold or ~$100 to get gear that will be instantly replaced.</div></div><hr />

What are you drinking??????if i buy a token when it is at 45k and put it for sale, even if it drops to 35k when someone buy it i stil get 45k. Is supply and demand...when price goes up a bunch of people buy tokens from store to put on sale..that means there is increased supply and the price drops. <br />
<br />
On the other hand people who are going to buy token with gold wait to buy it low...but the key part on this is that seller get the gold as is when he put the token on sale..<br />

That's not how it works at all, you can't decide what you sell it for. The price never fluctuates more than a couple k. This make believe land you're living in has no relevancy here.</div></div><hr />

Just like stats before, there's been gold selling websites forever.<br />
<br />
Just because someone can buy gear doesn't mean they win, I've encountered plenty of geared players who can do more than 15k when I have about the same IL and do 30k+.<br />

That were unsafe, illegal, against the TOS and could get you banned, Now Blizz approves it. Not sure how you cant see, at least, a small issue with that.<br />

SO its p2w then? Cause you can buy mythic and heroic BoEs for gold.<br />
<br />
P2W is such a BS term. IT really means Pay to not grind out. Because you cant &quot;WIN&quot; at least not with out 9-29 other people. DO I care that people can buy shit gear for cash? Not in the slightest. <br />
<br />
I do however find the whole thing distasteful in a sub based game.</div></div><hr />

Not technically, since there's only like 2 or 3 pieces (out of 16 gear slots) that can be sold on the AH per raid tier for each armor class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whale buys multiple tokens per month.<br />
Whale buys BOE epics, Whale buys Apexis epics, Whale buys whatever else Blizzards makes available for gold<br />
Now Whale has the gear to get into pug raids or just buys Raid carries and Whale is a Raider and has Raid acheivements<br />
Whale goes out in the WoW world and feels strong and it's all worth it to him.<br />
<br />
P2W doesn't mean you can pay your way to the very top. You can't pay your way into a raiding slot in a top guild. <br />
<br />
P2W DOES mean you can pay your way to a level of power FAR above equivalent skill players who don't spend a bunch of real-world money to buy gold. People here are wrong when they say things like &quot;it's not P2W unless you can buy Mythic level gear&quot;. Wrong! It's P2W anytime a player can buy a power beyond what they could personally achieve without spending money. <br />
<br />
Blizzard selling gold is nothing like aftermarket gold-sellers selling gold because Blizzard can manipulate the game in order to maximize their revenues. We are seeing the early signs of this and we will surely see a lot more of it.</div></div><hr />

The people that have the gold to buy 6 of those pieces will just buy higher ilvl BoEs from BRF/HFC. No one is going to buy Tokens just to buy some awful 675 piece.<br />

Seriously. Some people will defend anything.

Activision Blizzard is a business that aims to make the most profit, with the least effort possible. Some people will buy gold and purchase this gear. And they'll profit majorly from this.

I don't think you quite understand the concept of P2W. In 6.2 a player can get a high level armor set without fighting 1 mob, player, gathering node, pet battle, or entering 1 raid/dungeon. Buying gold from the Blizzard shop and then buying apexis armor with that gold is the definition of P2W. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has never sold gear with such a high ilvl as they release &quot;new&quot; content, but 6.2 changes that. Also for years Blizzard fought gold sellars and buyers (limited bans were common), but they now sell gold themselves.</div></div><hr />

What are you even talking about? They are changing the system over from literally that. The current system is &quot;grind daily quest for Apexis Crystals. Hand in Crystals for gear&quot;.

He worked in Blizzard for many years and talking with him you can understand how developers think, how and when make some changes and generally you get some hints of the design philosophy. I am sure care much more what GC says compare to a stranger forumer post (no personal offence to you).</div></div><hr />

In 6.2 a player can get a high level armor set without fighting 1 mob, player, gathering node, pet battle, or entering 1 raid/dungeon. Buying gold from the Blizzard shop and then buying apexis armor with that gold is the definition of P2W. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has never sold gear with such a high ilvl as they release &quot;new&quot; content, but 6.2 changes that. Also for years Blizzard fought gold sellars and buyers (limited bans were common), but they now sell gold themselves.<br />
<br />
You don't buy gold from the shop anyways, you're selling game time to other WoW players. Which that was already happening well before the tokens came out, so there is no difference whatsoever.<br />
<br />
You're still paying $15 to play. You can get 30k+ a month right now just doing 25mH Cata raids.<br />
<br />
Take it as you see it but still no difference from before, buy gold from websites, buy boes from the AH.</div></div><hr />

Not sure why so many of you are frothing in the mouth about &quot;PAY TO WIN.&quot; It'd be like Blizz selling i650 gear right now. . . If you think i650 gear is winning you need to actually log on. . . LFR drops i 655 right now!</div></div><hr />

I get your picture, and I'm 100% with you on the in-game shop. I'm one of the ones that think it should never have existed. But with the introduction of the WoW token, WoW's new business model is some kind of hybrid between GW2 and EVE. A subscription/E2P (Exchange to Play) model. I don't see that changing. But it is a far cry from P2W. I posted this in another thread:<br />
<br />
<br />
Aren't players the ones selling gold, more so than Blizzard is? You buy a token for $20, it sells for 20k gold. The other player pays 20k gold, instead of $15 for their game time. So you indirectly paid $15 to another player for 20k gold. Then Blizz gets $5 for handling the transaction. I'd imagine if Blizzard just gave you 20k gold for $20 without having a token to sell first, it would make this a very different issue.<br />
<br />
<br />
If blizzard just handed you gold for money, then people could argue it's P2W. But the model that they chose doesn't do that, you have to get gold from someone else, not out of thin air. Not to mention just having gold, doesn't give you any advantage over someone else that has gold (you can still get it everywhere in the game).<br />
<br />
The fact that WoW IS the largest subscription based MMO means they wouldn't be making the change if they didn't think it was sustainable. My guess is the WoW token might exist so people don't get burned out with yearly expansions. Because I know I don't want to spend $50 every year and a subscription fee on top of that.<br />
<br />
So I'm OK with the WoW token being able to be exchanged for gold. It doesn't change the game in any meaningful way. I am NOT OK with content being excluded from the game and having a price tag slapped on it (in-game shop).</div></div><hr />

Yes, it works exactly like that. Get ready for more gold sinks. Not like anyone predicted that. Stop living in denial.<br />

I'm confused why you are confused because shop pets are clearly not the same as tokens. And you are very naive if you think they are not going to add more goldsinks to make more money by increasing token supply. Selling tokens obviously has more priority than having more subscribers since it will generate more profit. They barely have any costs for these tokens, at least far less than attracting a new subscriber and keeping them entertained, and they only need three people to buy a token for gold to make up for one subscriber.</div></div><hr />
