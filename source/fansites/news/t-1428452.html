Blue Tweets<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
Minor example is ratio of ambush bonus dmg to backstab bonus dmg is constant at all levels, but backstab scales better with gear<br />
You'd find that all of the base damage on spells/abilities stays in constant ratios at all levels, for a given class, BTW. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408129439516471296))<br />
And that's the problem. For a lvl 30 with 150 SP, this increases Wrath by 138% but Healing Touch by just 28%<br />
Heals had higher base healing to make up for players having base health. However, that didn't line up and scale perfectly. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408140211420278784))<br />
In WoD, there will be no more base health, or base damage/healing on spells, so it's all just scaling; can line up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408140362843054080))<br />
So whats this going to do to dmg and healing at low lvls if you don't have heirlooms you won't have much stats.<br />
There are still base stats. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408159136526790656))<br />
Is there going to be a base amount of the new secondaries? like even with 0 crit rating u still crit<br />
No. You still crit with 0 crit rating because you have 5% base crit, and crit from agi/int. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408388234477973504))<br />
More similar to haste, where there is no base amount of haste. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408388486824087552))<br />
<br />
Does no Dodge/Parry on gear mean Strength -&gt; Parry and Agility -&gt; Dodge are being removed as well?<br />
Nope, those remain. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408330328961339392))<br />
<br />
Now that we have 3 new secondary stats (Amplify, etc.). How many of these stats will we see on a single piece of gear? Still 2?<br />
Still typically 2 secondary stats on most gear. May be exceptions, as always, but vast majority of the time, 2. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408297359433412608))<br />
<br />
Will melee abilities still be affected by Weapon damage. Or are those abilities now only scaled by AP?<br />
Yes, weapon damage will still be a thing. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408297028947427328))<br />
<br />
If this means all dmg spells and heals will scale with primary stat, this is a good thing although simplifies gear<br />
Typically Attack Power or Spell Power, which mostly come from your primary stat. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408122581212880896))<br />
<br />
would be nice for weapons to means as much to casters a physical.<br />
Somewhat ironically, weapons are actually *more* important for some casters, than some melees. SP bonus is huge. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408296295367847936))<br />
<br />
sorry if this is a repeat question but if I gem say spirit then trade to dps or tank does that gem change too eg haste for dps ?<br />
No, only primaries on armor slots switch. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408089701191405568))<br />
sorry im more asking for the gem side the fact that say pally chest has a gem socket do I have to swap it everytime swap spec ?<br />
Sorry, not sure I understand the question. If you put a Spirit gem in a socket, it provides no value if you respec to Feral. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408112465130438656))<br />
ok thank you that means if I have a gem socket armor piece when swap to my off spec I either need new gear or a different gem<br />
To min-max, yes. However, remember that a different item of the same ilvl likely won't have the gem socket; sockets are free. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408118304197189632))<br />
<br />
Will Cleave on gear mean CC'd mobs have to be moved to Uzbekistan to avoid sheep-busting?<br />
No. Cleave won't hit CC'd or mobs, or mobs you aren't in combat with. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408076595295817728))<br />
<br />
Does it mean won't be useful or won't be optimal? Is this applying to PVP too? <br />
Spirit will have zero value for non-healers, including in PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408075323813539840))<br />
<br />
In WoD, does the baseline yellow attack hit cap include attacks against targets that are higher than 3 levels above you?<br />
Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408034390569021440))<br />
Does that also mean a lvl 1 character will have 100% hit chance against a level 100 character or mobs? aoe questing inc<br />
No. Just up to +3 levels, then you start missing again. Similar to how Crushing Blows still exist now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/408052825839517696))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
I've had a question about PvP. Why is there a gear req? Why isn't it stats-agnostic, to make the game 100% skill-dependent? Thanks!<br />
WoW is a character driven game where you participate in different activities for rewards. PvP is one of those activities. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408667382832300032))<br />
I know that very well I would just love an option at some point in time for pure stat-agnostic, skill-based pvp.<br />
http://wowpedia.org/Trial_of_the_Gladiator (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408669295996989440))<br />
<br />
Also, kudos for taking out expertise and hit. Step in the right direction! Still, I wish all radials were disabled in PvP though!<br />
While there may be a place for a game with WoW gameplay and no stats/gear, WoW is not that game. WoW is an RPG. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408681349357137920))<br />
Why not poll the PvP population and see what they’d think of a permanent Trial-of-the-Champions play style?<br />
Polling the population is not how we design games. Personally, I'd find it pretty unrewarding. I like getting gear. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408682553982193664))<br />
<br />
Crafted pvp gear feels a bit gated. Not many want to use daily cd on making 476/458 gear. Maybe lower mats over time?<br />
We don't like the starter gear coming from crafting. Exploring the idea of BoE starter gear coming from battleground wins. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408667717554536448))<br />
OMFG BoE PvP starter gear?! If it's BoA I will make you a(nother) million cookies (BoE is still awesome though!)<br />
I can see your point but I think BoA might be worse in this case. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408670101886357505))<br />
<br />
What other steps would be in there to keep those first few BG experiences from being even more brutal to new folk?<br />
I think a lot of the UI changes we're making are in support that goal (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/408669540252278785))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
And you are the next Ghostcrawler ?<br />
Nah, I just work on flavor/feels things like Headless Horsemen &amp; Darkmoon Faires &amp; zombie plagues &amp; pets &amp; toys &amp; so on. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/408642392447647745))<br />
You're my friggin hero for trolling people about Kara so damn hard.<br />
Just wait until Heroic Zul'Farrak gets data mined. (Source (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/408497425729347584))<br />

I would love the return of farms in garrisons, as an optional way to get food resources, as well as a pond that can have unique fish! I liked the farm a lot, but didn't like that it was the primary way to gather food-stuffs for cooking. I would like a new farm that can provide a good amount, but is no where near required to level cooking.</div></div><hr />

If you win the token, you can use it immediately to create a piece that matches your current loot specialization, then also has a chance to proc as Warforged. Right now, my heroic tier pieces are limited to an (upgraded) maximum for 574 iLevel, but if a heroic WF piece drops, that can get up to 580. Would be nice for the tier pieces to also have a chance at that bonus.</div></div><hr />

The world bosses of Mists are cool and I like them, but they just stand in one place and chill. They aren't really a threat. I want more things like the Fel Reaver in Hellfire. The first time I went there it was magnificent. I had a sense of fear and dread would wash over me if the screen started to shake and I knew it was too late to get out of his path. Now you can easily avoid any danger that world bosses, let alone regular mobs may pose.<br />
