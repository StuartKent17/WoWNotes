This new feature has completed internal testing and is active on the Public Test Realms (PTRs), allowing players from the different PTRs to meet each other in Arena and Battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
We would be very interested in hearing your experience with the CLBR in the following thread, and especially any issues you might have encountered, such as having players from another PTR join a Battleground on the same side as you: http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=7679917949&amp;sid=1 (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=7679917949&amp;sid=1)<br />

Please note that this feature is not tied to patch 3.0.8 which is also currently on the PTRs, and may not go live at the same time. <br />

Lag in Naxxramas / Patch 3.0.8 &quot;imminent&quot; (See how I used quotes?) <br />
Unfortunately, the optimizations we are prepared to make in order to reduce latency and disconnections in Naxxrammas cannot be added in a hotfix. A patch is required. I'm unable to provide a release date for the next minor content patch including these optimizations, but I'd wager it's imminent.

Enchant Weapon - Titanguard removed from Patch 3.0.8 (Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/january/titanguard.jpg))<br />
Had this enchant gone live it would have become THE enchant for nearly all tanks. It would not have been an interesting choice. We would have had to keep introducing higher tiers of the same enchant, or else players would just keep using this version for perpetuity. We put Stamina already on many items. We don't think your weapon needs one as well. I received messages from several tanks for very prominent guilds asking us to please not go forward with this enchant. They understood why it was bad for the game.<br />
<br />
Death knights have access to superior enchants in part because they do not have a shield or ranged weapon slot and the stats provided by those items.<br />
<br />
The PTR is for testing. If you find yourself frustrated that things change between the PTR and live, I would suggest you stop paying attention to the PTR notes. Even if a change like this had already gone live, we probably would have changed it anyway. We did not like what this enchant would have done for the game.

<br />
Future tanking weapon enchants<br />
We'd like to add more interesting tanking weapon enchants, but have to be very careful not to make them fall into the same problem as Titanguard. Ideally we would like to be able to design encounters without the assumption that every tank has X on their blade. It would be nice if even putting something on your weapon to increase damage (and therefore threat) felt like a viable alternative.

<br />
PvE - Monsters Hit box / Attack range<br />
There are some mobs, and Grobbulus is an example, where there was disagreement in the data between the attack range of the creature and the size of its hit box. This caused the creature to constantly readjust its position. This bug has been fixed in 3.0.8. It might not solve every situation where the behavior your described is occuring, but it should certainly help. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14318908582-gc--are-there-any-plans-to-fix-this.html))<br />
<br />
Achievement - Collect 100 Mounts<br />
Yes, we like mounts and more will be added in the future making an achievement like mount collecting easier to obtain. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/14318867196-100-mount-achievement--unreasonable.html))<br />
<br />
RNG Stuns in PvP<br />
Yes, we instituted those random procs on purpose. We knew what we were doing. Sand gnomes did not sneak in and make the changes for us. Upon reflection, and with more player feedback, we have come to the conclusion that it was the wrong decision. Originally we thought getting rid of the mace spec stun was sufficient. Now we think random stuns are probably not good for the game across the board. You don't need to ask about individual talents or spells. If it is a random chance to stun attached to another spell or ability, chances are we will phase it out.<br />
<br />
On RNG: As I have said, we are not trying to remove RNG from the game. If your chance to crit is less than 100% and something happens when you crit, then congrats, there is RNG in your Arena. But we don't want RNG to dominate skill and other factors. Randomly proc'd stuns, like the recent changes to the dispel system, are something that crossed the line. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318707167-remove-rng-stun--buff-damage.html))<br />
<br />
Raid instance difficulty and scaling<br />
I think the concern is because we were slow to fix some balance problems in the past so players are concerned that if we don't fix the problem now that they will be dealing with it for many tiers to come. It is a totally valid response given our history, but we are making a big effort to make changes in a more timely manner. <br />
<br />
BC launched with more raid content, but I think it's fair to say that it required a lot of polishing after we shipped. Balance was not great. We had to change some item stats. I think the SSC trash respawned in 45 minutes or something.<br />
<br />
We designed the current content to be easy and I think we were pretty up front about that before ship. While we can all laugh about Karazhan being srs bzns now, at the time a lot of players wiped on the boney horses and never went back. That's a shame because it was a cool instance and a gateway to a lot of additional raid content. Some of the best moments in WoW occur in these raids. You see unique art (and hear unique music!), scripted events and some amazing lore moments. It makes me sad to think of players who will never even step foot in Naxx. But that doesn't mean all of our raid content needs to be at the introductory level. If you're looking for a challenge, I suspect you will find it in Ulduar.<br />
<br />
We know some players can chew through content pretty quickly. It is one of the biggest challenges of MMO development to provide enough content. Players always want more. Always. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318637418-why-so-much-qq-about-scaling-when.html))<br />
<br />
Threat generation in WotLK<br />
We wanted to make threat easier to manage, especially at earlier tiers of content. However threat generation is still the responsibility of the tank as well as the rest of the group. If your tank has trouble with threat generation, then you may run into encounters where you can't beat the timer.<br />
<br />
It is only my opinion, and some groups can still make it work, but often the tanks complaining that they can't hold aggro or always asking the dps to slow down are the ones who choose gear and talents solely for survivability over threat-generation and try and argue that they don't care how terrible their own dps is. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14318919433-gc-blizzards-tanking-philosophy-question.html))<br />
<br />
Stamina enchants for tanks<br />
There are already stamina enchants on many pieces of gear. Casters can go that route of stacking spellpower on as much gear as possible, but if they ignore int and mana regen, that spellpower will be for naught. With tanks, we have found that given the choice between stamina and anything else (assuming you are comparing things of equivalent level) stamina will always win. One of the few enchants where you actually have a decison would be replaced by yet another stamina enchant. I am pretty confident the same thing would happen with a stamina to cloak enchant.<br />
<br />
Here is the player's point of view: Ah, an enchant for my weapon. That will help me survive and help out my healers, therefore making me a slightly better tank. Maybe I'll be slightly better prepared for KT or Sarth + 3 or Ulduar. Awesome.<br />
<br />
Except... here is the developer's point of view: Okay, we just buffed every tank in the game by 750 health. That means we now have to make every mob hit slightly harder to compensate. Otherwise we are just buffing tank survivability for no reason. The net effect to you would be pretty negligible in the long run, while any tank who chose not to put stamina on his or her weapon would suddenly be at a disadvantage. <br />
<br />
Pet balance and survavibility<br />
It's nearly impossible to make an AI-controlled pet smart enough to always do the right things especially in encounters as complicated as ours. We try to work around that by letting the pet survive when it does the wrong thing (staying out during Saph deep breaths for example).<br />
<br />
It may be that for specs like BM (and Demonology) that the pet just too high a percent of overall damage. When the pet does well, you do very well, but when the pet suffers, you suffer too much as well, so that your success hinges a lot more on encounter design. If we nerfed the pet damage, we would buff the character's of course.<br />
<br />
Another idea some players have advocated lately is to prevent the pet from getting buffed at all, but let it scale better from buffs on the player. This removes some of the inconsistencies where the pet can't benefit from buffs properly. We don't currently have the technology to do that, but it is something we are exploring. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318704718-hunter-feedback-blizzard-is-looking-for.html))<br />
<br />
Healer UI<br />
I have mentioned our UI in a couple of threads. To briefly reiterate, some players just like managing mods, which is why we support it. But you should be able to heal a raid without a mod. I have done it, but it should be easier than it is. Incorporating more useful tools into the default UI without overcomplicating it is something we are definitely interested in. An example I use a lot is the ability to view buffs and debuffs on a target at once. For say a Resto druid healing Maexxna who is also doing Abolish Poison, it can be frustrating not to see both.

[US] New PvE Realm - Borean Tundra<br />
We have opened a brand new PvE realm, Borean Tundra, for those players looking for a fresh start! As a fresh realm it will not be open to paid character transfers or Death Knight character creation (unless a player reaches level 55 with another character on this realm) for three months, and in-game events like the opening of Ahn’Qiraj will be waiting for players to be completed. This realm will be part of the Emberstorm battlegroup and set to the Central timezone. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/14318868330-brand-new-pve-realm--borean-tundra.html))<br />

[US] PvE and RP Free Character Moves<br />
This thread will contain information on the free character moves to and from PvE and RP realms we currently have available to assist in population dispersal. In the event that these realms meet our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to these realms will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience. No characters will be eligible for these free moves once the transfers have been closed.<br />
<br />
You can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html)<br />
<br />
These free characters moves are being offered to brand new realms. Players on the realms listed below have the option of moving characters to Winterhoof (PvE) or Wyrmrest Accord (RPPvE). Both realms belong to the Emberstorm battlegroup and are in the pacific timezone.<br />
<br />
Please note that the RP rule set applies to Wyrmrest Accord and will be enforced. Only players who are interested in a role-play environment are encouraged to move to this realm. For more information on RP policies, please refer to the following: http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=20458 (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=20458)<br />
<br />
These transfers are scheduled to close on Friday, January 23, at 9:00 pm PST provided our transfer goals are not reached prior to this time.<br />

[US] Drak'tharon and Tortheldrin realms<br />
In the short term, our plan is to allow free character moves from Drak'Tharon and Tortheldrin to compensate for the fact that our free character move goals to these realms were exceeded before we shut them down. We do apologize for the inconvenience this has caused players on both realms. It is never our intention to lower the queues of other realms by forcing queues upon previously-low population realms. I do not at this time have a time frame for the opening of free character moves from these two realms, and will get back to you as soon as possible when I have more to provide.

Defense Sigil and Enchant<br />
We added that sigil and enchant because death knights had difficulty reaching the defense &quot;cap&quot; in part because they don't have shields, ranged weapons or often tanking weapons. A DK who gears solely for survivability in this way is probably also going to have threat problems. Part of the reason we make tanks have to manage threat is so their gear choices aren't always as simple as &quot;whatever gives me the best survivability.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14318707674-enchant-weapon--titanguard-removed.html))<br />

Free respec in 3.0.8?<br />
We normally only offer respecs to classes that have some significant changes in talent locations and costs. At this point there is no plan to allow for free respecs for death knights. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318708396-will-dks-be-getting-a-free-respec.html))<br />
<br />
Howling Blast cooldown on 3.0.8 PTRs<br />
Howling Blast was designed for AE dps, for which it was doing too much damage without a cooldown. We totally understand the concern about having a cooldown being awkward to work along with rune cooldowns, which is why we removed it. But that change made the spell too powerful, as we feared.<br />
<br />
We will continue to iterate on the design and the ultimate goal is to remove the cooldown. There are some ways we can reign in the damage (such as a smaller AE cap or the damage falling off after the initial target) that will take some more time and testing to implement.<br />
<br />
The DK is a new class, and while it is working well overall, you can expect to see some iteration on it compared to the classes that have been tested and upon which players have experimented for four years.

Starfall intended use<br />
As I said, Starfall is a non-channeled AE. You can Hurricane and Starfall at the same time for instance. It is a dps increase over not pushing the button given that you can do other things while the damage is going off. If the damage is so low that you don't invest in the talent, then we will buff it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318707167-remove-rng-stun--buff-damage.html))<br />
<br />
Starfall bug<br />
Let me explain this in seed of corruption terms - Our starfall is being applied on the primary target on each star, but the &quot;seedsplosion&quot; is occuring CENTERED ON THE CASTER. Not on the area where the star hit. <br />
This is fixed. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318707167-remove-rng-stun--buff-damage.html))<br />

Balancing BM-51 (Beast Mastery) Talent<br />
We think the ultimate solution to feedback about BM-51 is just to add more talents to the pet talent trees so that the bonus 4 talent points can improve pet dps by an amount equivalent to the cost of the hunter talent point. The exotic pets themselves would be more of window-dressing, perhaps with more utility from some of their special abilities.

Blessing of Sanctuary potential changes<br />
I'm going to assume you are getting at Blessing of Sanctuary here. We think that is a valid concern and something we plan to address. It was intended for a nice utility buff for Prot paladins, but we agree that its benefit feels too mandatory, or alternatively that some classes have trouble tanking some encounters without it.<br />
<br />
(Rest assured that we are not trying to nerf Prot paladin threat generation or really anything other than the semi-mandatory nature of BoSanc.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/14318919433-gc-blizzards-tanking-philosophy-question.html))<br />

Circle of Healing<br />
I hesitate to wade back into these waters, but Anathalt's reasoning here is pretty good: <br />
<br />
I can give you some pieces here, but not the full picture:<br />
-It starts with the trivial nerf: just reduce the healing output. They tried that, they found the button felt too weak.<br />
-They looked at increasing the mana cost, but their experience with mana in the Sunwell made them concerned this nerf wouldn't last.<br />
-They concluded that adding a cast time would both not sufficiently nerf the spell and would remove one of the core fun things about the spell.<br />
-They looked at returning CoH to the party heal mechanic, but they didn't like the effect that had on raid positioning.<br />
-They tried the arcane blast mechanic, but that was complicated and not very fun to play.<br />
-I would presume they tried some variant on the diminishing returns mechanics people have proposed, and decided against those because they were too complicated.<br />
<br />
The only correction I would make is to mana cost (which includes a Barrage style implementation). From a designer POV, messing around with mana cost seems like it would be an interesting decision. Oh, this spell heals a lot but is very expensive so the player will think twice before casting it. In reality though that doesn't often happen. Instead players tend to use the powerful spells anyway and then struggle to manage their mana and perhaps complain that we didn't design their class to have enough mana regen. I don't think players would have really hesitated to push the button a third or fourth time -- they would have done it anyway and drained their mana. (The alternative is the spell is sooo expensive that it just becomes a joke and good priests take it off their bar.)<br />
<br />
When you want players to diversify their rotations, cooldowns are usually the simplest change that guarantees the behavior you want. Setting up buffs, like Arcane Blast, is another.<br />
<br />
The design works okay for Arcane Blast because really that spell itself is just a buff working towards your next Arcane spell, kind of like building up combo points. We probably could have developed the priest in that direction, where you hit Circle of Healing a few times to build up a big buff stack and then finish off the heal with another group spell. That is just a pretty different design at that point.<br />
<br />
There is also something of a myth that CoH was a perfectly balanced spell until the smart component. We were quite worried about what it was doing at the end of BC, which is why one of the very first changes we made to priests during LK development was to add the cooldown. We listened to players (and developers) who were concerned the cooldown would kill what was fun about the spell, so we did take it off (with some hesitation). But it turns out that was the wrong move and we probably should have stuck to our guns and shipped with the cooldown so priests didn't feel nerfed after LK went live.

<br />
Inner Fire<br />
Inner Fire is something we are still discussing. We would ultimately like to move buffs with charges to a longer duration but we need to work out a few other inconsistencies with the buff system before we make that call.

Warlock feedback post on official forums (Link (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14318777313&amp;sid=1))<br />
Don't over-analyze &quot;never.&quot; One player phrased it as &quot;spells I should be using, but am not.&quot; That is more of what I was going for. I knew this thread would be long so I wanted to give it more focus than just having players go on for paragraphs on what the warlock class means to them or how they would redesign it.<br />
<br />
I am surprised by how many players are referencing spell mechanics that have changed (e.g. stones, Infernal). I can understand if they have been useless for so long that you gave up on them, but really if you are passionate enough to have strong enough opinions on your class to post, you owe it to yourself to do a little research. It just makes it hard for us to know whether you are refering to a LK or BC (or older) mechanic with your feedback.<br />
<br />
I am also amused by those cynics who are offended that they are being asked their opinion. We have our own plans for the warlock, but we like to make informed decisions and seeing what players think is always useful information to have.<br />
<br />
But on a positive note, many of these posts are very easy to read and comprehend, for which I thank you. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318777313-warlocks-which-spells-do-you-never-use.html))<br />

Deep Wounds<br />
On the one hand, it is cool to see tanks be able to take a talent that improves their dps. On the other hand, we removed Defiance for a reason, namely that it was an uninteresting talent that every tank felt they had to have, and we don't want to see Deep Wounds just become Defiance 2.0.<br />

We don't want to nerf Deep Wounds without increasing Arms damage in PvE and PvP to compensate. We have not made any changes to Deep Wounds so far.<br />

Featured Addons – Issue 3 - ClosetGnome (by Trell (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?action=profile;u=5774))<br />
In the third issue of Featured Addons, I'm gonna show you an awesome addon, called ClosetGnome. It's another WoWAce addon, and is essential for practically all classes.<br />
<br />
ClosetGnome is basically, as the name suggests, a wardrobe manager for your WoW character. No, it doesn't help you choose which suit to wear to the latest Ogrimar Ball, neither will it choose your party frock for the Stormwind Homecoming. It will, however, allow you to specify sets of gear, which you can then switch to with a simple click, or keypress. Any set that you create can then be keybound, or accessed from the button on the Minimap, or the Fubar Menu.<br />
<br />
There are also a few optional modular addons you can download to use with ClosetGnome, adding functions such as:<br />
<br />
Oh Noes (unequip your weapons when your health reaches a certain %, to save a little bit of repair gold)<br />
Tooltip (adds a line to your tooltip on mouseovering gear to show you what set - if any - that item is assigned to)<br />
<br />
So, lets start with some in depth explanations, with pictures and everything (click the links to see full size images). Before I explain fully about how to config ClosetGnome, please bear in mind that I'm running my config through Fubar/RockConfig - however, should you not have Rock, you can configure it through the Fubar menu (http://khorium.mmo-champion.com/murlocarmy/trell/closetgnome_fubarmenu.gif), or the minimap menu. Conversely, heres the Rock Config menu (http://khorium.mmo-champion.com/murlocarmy/trell/closetgnome_rockconfig.gif).<br />
<br />
Now, lets get onto configuring and adding your first set. Go to the Add option, and you will get this screen (http://khorium.mmo-champion.com/murlocarmy/trell/closetgnome_addset.gif) come up.<br />
<br />
Click the link to see the full size image, and you'll see that each item slot in your character window will have a green or a red box around it. A red box around the slot means that it won't be affected by your switch - a green slot means it will. Click each slot with the mouse to switch it from red to green or vice versa. Now, drop all the gear into each slot that you'll be using for this set - lets say for example that it's going to be a +fire damage set (as an example) - so I would drop all my +fire damage gear in. <br />
<br />
Once you've set all the gear you want in your slots, and made sure that all the slots you want changed have green boxes, simply type a memorable name in the box - for example, I may use something like 'FireDamageSet' - then click the Add button. Thats it, you've just saved your first set! Continue to follow the steps above to add more sets.<br />
<br />
Once you've added all your sets, you can get onto configuring any other modular addons you installed at the same time. Lets take a look at the Zone options (http://khorium.mmo-champion.com/murlocarmy/trell/closetgnome_addzoneset.gif). As you can see, you'll need to actually be physically in the zone you want to set an auto switching set for, but once you are, simply choose one of your already setup sets, and thats it done.<br />
<br />
Now onto the fun config - Oh Noes (http://khorium.mmo-champion.com/murlocarmy/trell/closetgnome_ohnoes.gif)! You can tick the box if you want to remove your weapons only when you have aggro, and also drag the slider to determine at what % you'll remove your weapons. Ensure you have free bag space, or it won't actually work ;)<br />
<br />
Switcher (http://khorium.mmo-champion.com/murlocarmy/trell/closetgnome_switcher.gif) - This enables you to choose different sets for drinking, eating, innervate, login and logout, and will add different class only options, like evocation, or stealth.<br />

I think the concern is because we were slow to fix some balance problems in the past so players are concerned that if we don't fix the problem now that they will be dealing with it for many tiers to come. It is a totally valid response given our history, but we are making a big effort to make changes in a more timely manner. <br />
<br />
BC launched with more raid content, but I think it's fair to say that it required a lot of polishing after we shipped. Balance was not great. We had to change some item stats. I think the SSC trash respawned in 45 minutes or something.<br />
<br />
We designed the current content to be easy and I think we were pretty up front about that before ship. While we can all laugh about Karazhan being srs bzns now, at the time a lot of players wiped on the boney horses and never went back. That's a shame because it was a cool instance and a gateway to a lot of additional raid content. Some of the best moments in WoW occur in these raids. You see unique art (and hear unique music!), scripted events and some amazing lore moments. It makes me sad to think of players who will never even step foot in Naxx. But that doesn't mean all of our raid content needs to be at the introductory level. If you're looking for a challenge, I suspect you will find it in Ulduar.<br />
<br />
We know some players can chew through content pretty quickly. It is one of the biggest challenges of MMO development to provide enough content. Players always want more. Always. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14318637418-why-so-much-qq-about-scaling-when.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok I think this is just a very bad excuse for Blizzard not shipping more raids in their box. How can they go on to say that simply because SSC trash timers were 45 mins, or that Skele Horsey hits hard as a valid excuse for not giving us more raid content? I mean come on - this isn't a joke here or anything! My being a casual player at the moment, and having just recently returned to WoW and I've completed all the pve raids in both normal and heroic instances! <br />
<br />
I can't draw any parallels with their argument that those hardcore people chew through content realy quickly hence they don't provide content up front! I mean - I am certain that most of us within the casual category have redone Naxx, Sarth, Maly and Vault numerous amounts of time since 3/4 of those raids are merely 4 x 4 boxes and a boss =.= . At least in TBC - there was some linearity in dungeon design - you move from point A to point B boss with a sense that they were integeral and part of the surrounding/instance ... WotLK on the other hand feels like bossess were placed there for no apparent reason - Sarth being a prime example. <br />
<br />
Just to draw a slight comparison the effort placed into BC as opposed to WotLK, in terms of raid content:<br />
<br />
Wrath TBC<br />
Naxx (doesn't really count since it is a resuse) Kara<br />
Malygos Gruuls<br />
Sarth Magtheridon<br />
Vault (doesn't really count tbh =.= ) SSC<br />
Uldar TK <br />
XXX (maybe one more before ice crown) Hyjal<br />
Ice Crown BT<br />
SWP<br />
<br />
If you actually realise how much effort placed into Wrath raid content now one would say it borders dismal and appalling. I'm not whinning about the difficulty - I'm quite happy that many people are given the opportunity to defeat raid bosses and all, BUT come on man - what a misguided excuse for using &quot;let us all see content&quot; for &quot;lets produce less and save costs&quot;. Naxx is a recycled instance, so all that was actually produced when wrath shipped were three 4x4 rooms in which you battled only 1 boss or if you like you can handicap your raid by pulling 3 other mini-bosses when you engage the main one. I mean, this isn't just confined to PvE - it's much noticeable in the PVP (reusing of item schemes or item schemes which are absoultely bland and poor in quality - look at arena sets) and technical side of the game too (bugs and more bugs then TBC + instance servers full on medium servers =.= ).<br />
<br />
I think what is important here is that players should stop fighting amongst themselves, labelling each other as hardcore or casuals ... it's Blizzard in the end of the day that's laughing their way to the bank by using such a diversionary technique of pitting the two cateogries of consumers against each other. Silly ain't it, that we are paying so much a month and getting less than we use to?</div></div><hr />

We put Stamina already on many items. We don't think your weapon needs one as well. I received messages from several tanks for very prominent guilds asking us to please not go forward with this enchant. They understood why it was bad for the game.<br />
<br />
Their reasoning is so off sometimes. There are mandatory enchants already. There's always that one enchant that gives the most value for a certain class and once everyone figures it out it becomes mandatory.</div></div><hr />

I have to say that it's hard enough to communicate with my fellow German-speaking colleagues. Therefore I guess it will be hard to win a bg. But when you had to talk the guys you played with were ignorant anyways and you had no chance to win if not 10 of the 15 men/women you played with knew what they did. <br />
<br />
But I do not see any further impact on BG-play with this change, but that it alienates you even more from the societies on your servers than the merger of the servers did. <br />
<br />
Sorry for my poor English (I hope you get my point)....</div></div><hr />

i think there are 7 guilds on my server (may be 8 or 9 since i last checked) who have completed all the content. if you are a casual, playing once or twice a week you will not be in one of those guilds.<br />
<br />
Stop QQ'ing, you either accept more content will be added, slow down a bit and stop playing 4-7 nights a week, or of course, you could have asked them to release WotLK in May, and be stuck with the TBC raids and level 70 cap for an extra few months.<br />
<br />
And to ABear, when i last read about it, i think it's that the whole team will be picked from a certain language/group, so if you are with German people on your server, in the bg your team will be german, but the other team could be from spain, france, england, russia etc.<br />
<br />
That's at least the idea i got from it when i read it a while ago. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
AFAIK players of different nationalities would only be on the opposing side of the BG, not on the same side, so there would be no communication problems (or at least not more than now...).<br />
<br />
What I don't understand is, why is it easier to put servers from different nationalities in one RP but not just more servers of the same nationality. I thought servers were grouped by proximity (of the hardware). Are there french/german/english/etc. servers in different server pools in every country?</div></div><hr />

I'm going to assume you are getting at Blessing of Sanctuary here. We think that is a valid concern and something we plan to address. It was intended for a nice utility buff for Prot paladins, but we agree that its benefit feels too mandatory, or alternatively that some classes have trouble tanking some encounters without it.<br />
<br />
(Rest assured that we are not trying to nerf Prot paladin threat generation or really anything other than the semi-mandatory nature of BoSanc.) (Source)<br />
<br />
<br />
Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo......ooooo.<br />
<br />
Blessing of Sanctuary finally became something, that Protties always wanted. In TBC after each fight I had to drink or go and hope my Seal/Judge of wisdom will regen my mana quick enough before I fall asleep. <br />
In WotLK thanks to increased mana from Seal/Judge AND thanks to Blessing of Sanctuary not only Tankadin vs. 1 Mob doesnt leave Tankadin on 0 mana (at least half/75%) but pulling larger group (IE doing our best, AoE tanking) leaves us with full mana.<br />
<br />
I can guess that they are going to do something to our beloved Blessing of Sanctuary , that our primary blessing for Solo/Heroic/Whatever will be Kings' .....AGAIN.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You sir fail! <br />
<br />
Do not simply dismiss comments made by others by your childish caricature neither should you simply assume that I play 4 - 7 nights a week.It's kinda sad that people like you are allowed to run rampant assuming that UFOs are real and all. <br />
<br />
For your info, I only raid twice a week - here i stated it! Within those 2 days, not more than 6 hours in total were dedicated to raiding i.e. for 1 week i raid for 6 hours on every 25 man content and actually complete it. If you think that's rather impossible than you sir, are absolutely mistaken or under a disbelief of some sort. Naxx is doable in 3 hours, Sarth 1 hour - even with 3 drakes up, Vault lets not talk about it and Maylgos maybe 40 mins. I'm not complaining that it's too easy, I fully support the idea of opening up raids to more people BUT what I do not see logical is them using the said excuse to produce less raids. Why should I pay the same amount of fees for less as compared to TBC? <br />
<br />
Each week I shudder to go into Naxx simply because it's the same old 3 hours worth of shebang. You're fanboy-ishness has simply deluded you that the quality and quantity produced has just simply gone down hill. Good fun licking Blizz's ass... and start being sensible as a consumer<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S - this game is no longer about being hardcore, it's about being skilled so don't tell me your load of crap that guilds need 4 - 7 days to complete all the raid instances</div></div><hr />

We think the ultimate solution to feedback about BM-51 is just to add more talents to the pet talent trees so that the bonus 4 talent points can improve pet dps by an amount equivalent to the cost of the hunter talent point. The exotic pets themselves would be more of window-dressing, perhaps with more utility from some of their special abilities. (Source)<br />

right.. so you have to have a certain status in-game before problems will be recognized? no wonder certain screw ups in the game are never fixed. you have to be kungen before anyone listens to you apparently. truly pathetic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Newor</div><div class="date">2009-01-18, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To be honest, i'd rather they simply buffed the amount of mana gain. That itself pales in comparison to the rage regen, especially when it's currently at the point that warriors have more avoidance unbuffed that tankadins do. It also feels WAY too much like an AoE tool, and for single-target encounters, it's not giving anywhere near enough mana back. Personally, it'd be much better if it restored a % of mana based on damage taken as well as it's current effect (on dodge/block/parry). That change alone would solve most of the problem, and would certainly help with true PvP viability (although, after saying that, i'm currently rendering my newest video which contains a lot of both PvE and PvP content).<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, for AoE encounters, it shines. But why not buff the mana regen in general? When we're on an AoE pack, our mana is constantly full anyway. When we're on a single or duel target setup, it just feels underwhelming. It's only when on 3 or more targets that it's actually providing me with a sustainable source of regen (i'm talking outside of raids, so Soloing for example).<br />
<br />
But, i'm glad they did actually do something with it for Wrath, rather than leaving it at the VERY mediocre -80 damage reduction it was.<br />
<br />
Either that as the idea, or a debuff that speeds up the attackers melee, but reduces it's damage. I know that on tough caster mobs (The quest in Icecrown, where you collect the priest's gear to summon/resurrect him), when they aren't casting, they do melee, but it's at such a slow rate that it's not giving me nearly enough mana, and if i drop JoL or SoL in favour of their mana-restoring counterparts, it's likely i'll end up dead. I realise &quot;group [5]&quot; quests are supposed to require a group, but if i wan't to try my hand at soloing, should i be limited by the one factor that's been crippling us for all of TBC, and even into Wrath (although that is to a lesser extent)?<br />
<br />
<br />
It's acceptable that a skill or talent couldn't be a win/win for every single situation. Otherwise we would just have aoe attacks for example since they could do it to just do the same amount of damage to single as your best single target spell or multi target as your best multi target spell and save a lot of time and effort on developing stuff.<br />
<br />
The same way that a G5 quest is TOTALLY aceptable to not be soloable. Sure you can have a class/spec combo that can solo that G5, but believe me, that same class/spec will just be destroyed trying to solo another G5 that you could solo. I soloed lots of G&quot;x&quot; quests that my friends couldn't, but at the same time I couldn't solo that G5 from wintergard, where my prot warrior friend could solo it easily just because he could stun the mob every time he used revenge (and for a prot warrior, he can use it almost every time), &quot;stunlocking&quot; it. Yes just because the mob wasn't immune to stun and I can't stun as much as he can.<br />
<br />
Should I start asking blizzard to give me the ability to stunlock others because I can't solo one of the G5 in the game? Nope. Actually it shouldn't be soloable even by him, since it kinda go against the &quot;multiplayer game/group quest&quot; aspect (not to mention a G5 quest), but...</div></div><hr />

Howling Blast<br />
Howling Blast was designed for AE dps, for which it was doing too much damage without a cooldown. We totally understand the concern about having a cooldown being awkward to work along with rune cooldowns, which is why we removed it. But that change made the spell too powerful, as we feared.<br />
<br />
We will continue to iterate on the design and the ultimate goal is to remove the cooldown. There are some ways we can reign in the damage (such as a smaller AE cap or the damage falling off after the initial target) that will take some more time and testing to implement.<br />
<br />
The DK is a new class, and while it is working well overall, you can expect to see some iteration on it compared to the classes that have been tested and upon which players have experimented for four years.

Howling Blast cooldown on 3.0.8 PTRs<br />
Howling Blast was designed for AE dps, for which it was doing too much damage without a cooldown. We totally understand the concern about having a cooldown being awkward to work along with rune cooldowns, which is why we removed it. But that change made the spell too powerful, as we feared.<br />
<br />
We will continue to iterate on the design and the ultimate goal is to remove the cooldown. There are some ways we can reign in the damage (such as a smaller AE cap or the damage falling off after the initial target) that will take some more time and testing to implement.<br />
<br />
The DK is a new class, and while it is working well overall, you can expect to see some iteration on it compared to the classes that have been tested and upon which players have experimented for four years.

Blessing of Sanctuary finally became something, that Protties always wanted. In TBC after each fight I had to drink or go and hope my Seal/Judge of wisdom will regen my mana quick enough before I fall asleep. <br />
In WotLK thanks to increased mana from Seal/Judge AND thanks to Blessing of Sanctuary not only Tankadin vs. 1 Mob doesnt leave Tankadin on 0 mana (at least half/75%) but pulling larger group (IE doing our best, AoE tanking) leaves us with full mana.<br />
<br />
I can guess that they are going to do something to our beloved Blessing of Sanctuary , that our primary blessing for Solo/Heroic/Whatever will be Kings' .....AGAIN.<br />
<br />
<br />
You do know that kings is (still) better? Granted, if you overgear the content, sanct is better for mass-pulling and the mana/rage/runic regen. But the part that makes BoSanct &quot;beloved&quot; is the 3% damage reduction. Any tank worth their shield (or frost presence, or bear fur) knows that a % of damage reduction is far better than any resource regen. I don't bless sanct because of mana returns on every hit, I bless it because it means I live longer. And for that matter, I bless it to the raid (if all other blessings are covered) because it means less AoE damage taken, too. Not much, but it can help the healers that little extra.</div></div><hr />

<br />
cuz if druids can get a &quot;lol i'm crit immune now&quot; move for tanking then why the hell can't DK's/Warriors/paladins get that same right? after all they're also a tanking class<br />
<br />
Survival of the Fittest was implemented to allow feral druids to be able to tank raids without having to stack RESILIENCE like we did in BT and beyond.<br />
<br />
You just don't like the fact that your talents are being changed, so your counter-argument is that every mandatory talent should be removed from the game ever, and therefore it doesn't matter what anyone chooses to spec because it will be fine. That makes the talent system pointless.<br />
<br />
They obviously will not implement leather [tanking] items that only one spec of one class can use in this game anymore, so the options would be to:<br />
a) make nearly every melee DPS drop a token that you can turn in for either a tanking version or a DPS version (hassling every leather wearer in the game)<br />
b) add a fourth set of feral tier gear that has so much defense on it that those five pieces alone reach the crit cap for defense (penalizing druids by forcing them to collect two tier sets just to be a decent feral druid)<br />
(c) tell you to stfu and be reasonable instead of wanting every other tanking class in the game to be as miserable as you have made yourself by having such an illogical, unreasonable reaction to this upcoming change</div></div><hr />

Which is why they've put in training instances for those people who aren't skilled. I can certainly tell you that there's guilds out there who need 4-7 days to complete Naxx. At this stage being in a 'hardcore' guild simply means you're done raiding on wednesdays and can go out drinking.<br />

Circle of Healing<br />
<br />
<br />
The only correction I would make is to mana cost (which includes a Barrage style implementation). From a designer POV, messing around with mana cost seems like it would be an interesting decision. Oh, this spell heals a lot but is very expensive so the player will think twice before casting it. In reality though that doesn't often happen. Instead players tend to use the powerful spells anyway and then struggle to manage their mana and perhaps complain that we didn't design their class to have enough mana regen. I don't think players would have really hesitated to push the button a third or fourth time -- they would have done it anyway and drained their mana. (The alternative is the spell is sooo expensive that it just becomes a joke and good priests take it off their bar.)<br />
<br />
<br />
The reasoning behind not simply increasing the mana cost for CoH boggles the mind. &quot;I don't think players would have really hesitated to push the button a third or fourth time -- they would have done it anyway and drained their mana.&quot; So according to blizzard every spell should be cheap enough to cast as much as you want because players are just so damn dumb they don't know how to manage mana so we'll do it for them. Smart thinking there.<br />
<br />
CoH is an instant cast spell so the priest can use as soon as it's needed, but this would penalize using it as often as they do now which is what makes the spell too good.<br />
<br />
Adding a 6 sec CD will simply make it a boring old &quot;cast every 6 seconds&quot; spell. Don't we already have enough of those types of things? Blizzard frequently spouts out about wanting to make players make decisions and then decides that players are too damn stupid to do that.<br />
<br />
One thing I would love to see is more glyph utilization for fixing these things. Fine add a 6 second CD, but add a glyph that increases the mana cost while removing the CD. Then we can see if players really can't think for themselves. This is off topic, but in another post holy nova was mentioned and it was stated that making it raid-wide would be too powerful, and if they nerfed it so that it was ok for that it wouldn't work for 5-mans. Here's another place that having a glyph shines. Leave it as it is and make a glyph that makes it raid-wide while reducing healing done. Not only would these kinds of solutions make the game more interesting but then people would, shockingly, have glyphs to CHOOSE from instead of as it is now that there are basically 2-3 mandatory glyphs and no one really gets anything else.</div></div><hr />

I have mentioned our UI in a couple of threads. To briefly reiterate, some players just like managing mods, which is why we support it. But you should be able to heal a raid without a mod. I have done it, but it should be easier than it is. Incorporating more useful tools into the default UI without overcomplicating it is something we are definitely interested in. An example I use a lot is the ability to view buffs and debuffs on a target at once. For say a Resto druid healing Maexxna who is also doing Abolish Poison, it can be frustrating not to see both. (Source)<br />
<br />
I wanted to adress the default UI in World of warcraft.<br />
<br />
I have my raidboxes stacked up, so when a target gets a debuff the box next to it just overlaps it, so I tend to ignore it, but the closer those boxes are stacked up the easier it is to manage healing. I'm a click-push kind of player, I have my left hand on my keybinds, and my right hand on my mouse to click in the raidboxes and push the right button. Not sure if it is possible to fix those raidboxes, because sometimes I slip and drag a raidbox half behind my actionbar, so can be quite annoying to heal. ;D<br />
<br />
Another issue is mainly my own characterframe, maybe it's possible to add the percentage next to the mana and healthbar, because when I enable it to see how much mana and health I have the numbers take the entire space of the frame, making it difficult to see how much is left of the blue bar (rather then looking at the numbers). lets say i have 25k mana, being able to see i have 10% mana then i know i have 2500 mana left. <br />
Just a personal issue.<br />
<br />
Also combattext that appears on my character, the amount of health restored works fine, but I would like to see more mana returns, like from the talent rapture, now I have to go into combatlog to see how much mana i get back. I could just drag out the combatlog, but my screen is already cluttered, with all actionbars out, and every single spot is occupied by a spell/item. I have one bar for healing, one for dispelling, one for offense, and two for utility/macros. I could take a screenshot of it in a 25mansetting, and post it.<br />
<br />
That seems to be my most important issues with the default UI. I will contribute more if I remember them.</div></div><hr />

Why not as a casual? I don't see how you can draw conclusions that we are unable to learn bosses before even entering - I've never set foot in Naxx pre-tbc neither even during tbc but I certainly don't think that the learning curve in wrath is harder than those in TBC raids - every trash pack is AoE-able and none of the bosses, save for achievement purposes, pose much challenge. Again ,the group in which you are categorizing are no more than the bad players not casuals. FYI it took me only 3 weeks to get to 80 from 70 and it seems that pretty much everyone in the casual category took about the same time too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a talent spell. People think that you're supposed to use talents without much thought as designed as often as possible. This is why adding a glyph isn't a test, since then you actually attach a big label saying &quot;this isn't the intended use, but hey do as you like&quot;. <br />
<br />
Then again, the mana concern is a valid point. During Sunwell it was ridiculous. Druids and Priests were using heavy-duty spells while staying at better mana levels than the supposed durability-healers that were Paladins simply due to the high amount of regen from spirit.<br />
So... simply because Blizzard is allowing so much mana regeneration for healers you really can't practically limit spells by mana cost since that'll only cause one of two situations: low-end content the spell is unusable due to cost or high-end content the spell is a no-brainer since it doesn't cost enough (and there's really no option for a golden balance, either)<br />
<br />
No, I DO agree that glyphs could perceivably be better utilized. There are always going to be useless glyphs (some of which deserves deletion, btw), though, that's just how it's going to stay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agreed, BoSanc finally solved tankadin mana problems in a good way. If they're going to make some major changes to this existing mechanic, they're going to have to very careful.<br />
<br />
For a long time now I've thought that a good alternative would be to bake some kind of mana/5 or mana on hit mechanic into Holy Shield (similar to the shaman's Water Shield). Or just bake the BoSanc effects into Improved Devo (although that has the serious downside of completely eliminating any possible aura flexibility). <br />
<br />
Even better though, why not just make &quot;Improved&quot; Kings baseline and call it a day? <br />
<br />
The paladin is the only tanking class that really &quot;needs&quot; BoSanc, and the current setup of having both spec'able paladin buffs in the prot tree seems poorly thought-out. The current setup either requires your Ret paladin to forsake 5 points in holy to increase seal/judgment damage, your holy paladin to forsake some crit from ret, or your prot paladin to feel demoralized by being the only one spec'ed for the two exact blessings he would want the most.</div></div><hr />

As I stated, the review wasn't mean to be posted - it was outdated, from pre wotlk, when I used to use it religously. It had auto Mount support too, via a plugin.<br />
<br />
Pre wotlk, it was pretty damn nice, and the only reason its not used so widely now is due to it not being updated fully.<br />

Anyway, I accept all the tomatoes you want to throw, my fault for not getting a newer addon feature up sooner. Hopefully you'll prefer the next one.</div></div><hr />

I think this comparison is a tad bit amusing. You're assuming that Blizzard is only planning to add one instance with each patch just because they haven't announced another part? <br />
<br />
Personally, I use Grid and find it much, much better than trying to use large, obnoxious boxes. <br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like somebody's been either quite blind or plainly ignorant - TBC shipped with both SSC and TK too. And to reiterate, Naxxramas doesn't count and neither should Vault which is just seriously more of a dps test aside from patchwek. <br />
<br />
so let me redo your so called brilliant illustration 2&lt;5<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S if you think that Vault really counts as anything than you sir should be playing peggle instead of WoW</div></div><hr />

&quot;Already cleared Naxxramas and don't know what to do on Sunday?&quot; should actually read &quot;Already cleared Naxxramas and don't know what to do with the rest of your Tuesday?&quot;<br />
<br />
make it happen.</div></div><hr />

Oh and TBC doesn't count either, so then 2 &gt; 0</div></div><hr />

Yes Mr Troll - we see your point of trolling pointlessly.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Broshious</div><div class="date">2009-01-20, 06:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a talent spell. People think that you're supposed to use talents without much thought as designed as often as possible. This is why adding a glyph isn't a test, since then you actually attach a big label saying &quot;this isn't the intended use, but hey do as you like&quot;. <br />
<br />
Then again, the mana concern is a valid point. During Sunwell it was ridiculous. Druids and Priests were using heavy-duty spells while staying at better mana levels than the supposed durability-healers that were Paladins simply due to the high amount of regen from spirit.<br />
So... simply because Blizzard is allowing so much mana regeneration for healers you really can't practically limit spells by mana cost since that'll only cause one of two situations: low-end content the spell is unusable due to cost or high-end content the spell is a no-brainer since it doesn't cost enough (and there's really no option for a golden balance, either)<br />
<br />
No, I DO agree that glyphs could perceivably be better utilized. There are always going to be useless glyphs (some of which deserves deletion, btw), though, that's just how it's going to stay.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm not sure which you're referring to. I think it's CoH. What do you mean &quot;this isn't the intended use, but hey do as you like&quot;? If you're adding a glyph then the new intended use of the skill is to use it either as designed which the people who think you should use talents as designed will do, or to take a look at the glyph, maybe try it out and see if it's useful. Can't see how that's a negative.<br />
<br />
Would you also consider the Druid Glyph of Healing Touch as one of those &quot;this isn't the intended use, but hey do as you like&quot;? It totally changes a basic healing spell that druids have.</div></div><hr />
