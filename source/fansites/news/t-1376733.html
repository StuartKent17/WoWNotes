SoCal Punk Legends Blink-182 to Close Out Blizzcon 2013<br />
Thousands of gamers are about to come to a party and celebrate all the big things (and all the small things too) . . . and maybe even fall in love with a gnome at a rock show when legendary Southern California punk rock trio Blink-182 headlines the closing concert at Blizzard Entertainment’s sold-out BlizzCon® gaming convention, taking place November 8–9 at the Anaheim Convention Center.<br />
<br />
Acclaimed worldwide for their influential and groundbreaking pop-punk sound, Blink-182 has achieved massive critical and commercial success, with over 35 million albums sold. Their third album, Enema of the State, went quintuple platinum and catapulted the band into superstardom.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately for fans of Blink-182’s “What’s My Age Again (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K7l5ZeVVoCA)?” video, Anaheim city ordinances strictly forbid the band from running naked through the streets around the convention center. BlizzCon attendees are kindly asked to adhere to the same policy.<br />
<br />
“After two days of hard work watching games and playing games and talking about games, we can’t think of a better way to kick back and relax than to have your face melted by Blink-182,” said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “We’re thrilled to have such an awesome band helping us bring BlizzCon to an epic conclusion.”<br />
<br />
“Nothing beats touring and playing in front of a live crowd,” said Tom DeLonge, Blink-182 guitarist and vocalist. “Our roots are in Southern California, so playing at BlizzCon will be like having a show in our own backyard—only with a couple thousand more orcs and elves in loincloths and bikini armor.”<br />
<br />
BlizzCon is a celebration of the global player communities surrounding Blizzard Entertainment’s Warcraft®, Diablo®, and StarCraft® game universes. The show will have an array of activities, including discussion panels, competitive and casual tournaments, contests, hands-on playtime with current and upcoming Blizzard Entertainment games, and more.<br />
<br />
While tickets to the convention are no longer available, viewers at home can join the excitement by ordering a BlizzCon Virtual Ticket (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/virtual-ticket/), which offers comprehensive live coverage of both days of the event, including Blink-182’s performance, via multi-channel HD Internet stream for $39.99 USD (pricing and availability may vary by region).<br />
<br />
DIRECTV customers in the United States can order the BlizzCon 2013 Pay Per View event, priced at $49.99 USD, which includes access to the Virtual Ticket online stream. Visit www.directv.com/blizzcon for more details.<br />
<br />
With multiple games in development, Blizzard Entertainment has numerous positions currently available—visit http://jobs.blizzard.com for more information and to learn how to apply. As BlizzCon draws closer, further details about the show will be announced at www.blizzcon.com.</div></div><hr />

So for the next expac to be closed off by Blink-182...<br />

Always the one guy who has to bitch. And to be honest, while they did really get their start in 94 they didn't become huge until 1998 and Enema of the State.</div></div><hr />

Ozzy is a legend....Blink had no influence on anything music related and had zero skill. All they had were little girls that thought they were cute, were you one of those little girls?<br />

BAD RELIGION formed the way for many punk bands.....while i dont like them at all, they had some talent and a true fan base. Would be a MUCH better choice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incorrect. I don't really like Blink-182, but they were one of the biggets bands in the 90's and influenced the entire pop-punk genre, for better and for worse, where as Ozzy was struggling to stay even remotely relevant in the 90's.<br />
<br />
Also, skill is stupidly overrated, and impossible to rate as it all revolves about subjectivity, luck and &quot;doing the right thing, and the right time&quot;. Ozzy for example, has never had an ounce of skill when it comes to the vocal department, yet he sounds recognizable and was lucky to work with a bunch of people who could write brilliant songs.<br />
<br />
Besides, your initial point was that since we aren't in the early 90's anymore, Blink should be irrelevant, according to that logic, since we aren't in the early 80's Ozzy should be irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

Blink. Time is often depicted as an hourglass, hourglasses generally have sand in them, sand in your eyes often makes you blink, 182 times.<br />

“What’s My Age Again? - time... Time wardens, time trawel and all that stuff?<br />
<br />
Clearly &quot;What's My Age Again?&quot; is related to Alzheimers disease and Dementia. <br />
<br />
<br />
So the conclusion of all of this? Expansion 5 is a Time Travel based expansion where we have to help Thrall recover his lost memories.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they were busy or uninterested. Also, didn't they recently loose a member or something like that?<br />
<br />
In general the &quot;Duh, they should've gotten X, Y and/or Z instead&quot; argument is silly, as we have *no* way of telling if or who they asked before asking Blink-182, maybe they asked 50 other acts, or maybe they didn't. Maybe they asked Bad Religion, and they turned them down - we don't know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Blink-182 has sold over 35 million albums worldwide.[1] In 2011, The New York Times asserted that &quot;no punk band of the 1990s has been more influential than Blink-182&quot; - &quot;Bad Religion has sold over 5 million albums worldwide,[4&quot;&quot;. If we rate succes via sales (which the modern, capitalist western world DOES), we can clearly see that Blink is more succesful and apparently had a bigger impact on the world.<br />
<br />
Oh, and I don't like neither band. Just stating facts.<br />

Well, they DID start by having Ozzy play... It's pretty darn hard to top him, simply due to his legacy.</div></div><hr />

I feel like alot of people like you saying they aren't so cal legends don't actually know their back catalogue. Cheshire Cat and Dude Ranch are 2 of my favourite albums. They were the 2 albums that have influenced a lot of local and international bands even if they are famous the are still legends on the scene of pop punk and punk rock...<br />

PS does any 1 know if i can watch this in australia if i get the virtual ticket?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure that I'm just 10 years beyond being excited about them, but I get this nagging feeling that Blizzard's only been getting groups that just happen to live in the Anaheim area so that they're not terribly inconvenienced for having to travel to the con. Cause I'm pretty sure Blink 182 hasn't done anything major in the last five years from what I've heard (apart from Barker being in a plane crash).<br />
<br />
For example: At 2011 Dave Grohl was mentioning that he only lived like 20 minutes away and talked about his swimming pool. :P</div></div><hr />

Though Ozzy did lay the foam hose down while it was still on and sprayed the monitors he was using for lyrics. He kinda stumbled along until a stage hand came out and turned it off. The audience did take some prompting by Ozzy as to how to ask for an encore. :) From a group that mostly blindly follows quests, what else can you expect.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure that I'm just 10 years beyond being excited about them, but I get this nagging feeling that Blizzard's only been getting groups that just happen to live in the Anaheim area so that they're not terribly inconvenienced for having to travel to the con. Cause I'm pretty sure Blink 182 hasn't done anything major in the last five years from what I've heard (apart from Barker being in a plane crash).<br />
<br />
For example: At 2011 Dave Grohl was mentioning that he only lived like 20 minutes away and talked about his swimming pool. :P<br />
<br />
Yup, you seem to be quite right, they all seem to live in CA. Oh and apparently Blink did an album 'bout two years ago, which I suppose counts as something pretty major as a band.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all. Punk doesn't have to sound like a wasted meth-head yelling about how much the establishment sucks, while pissing on your parents, and pop doesn't have to be some big-boobed airhead who sings about love and kittens.<br />
<br />
Besides, the genre is age old, The Ramones had plenty of pop-punk songs, pop-punk is all about mixing the fast punk tempos, chord changes and loud guitars with pop-influenced melodies and lyrical themes.<br />
<br />
Oh and you might think it's an oxymoron, doesn't change the fact that it's an old, and very established genre.<br />

<br />
When talking about pop-punk, there's the First Wave, like The Ramones and Bad Religion. Then there's the Second Wave, which is stuff like Blink, Good Charlotte and Sum 41.<br />
<br />
Besides, Green Day didn't really revive it as such, since they started out in '87, before the genre was in need of a &quot;revival&quot; so to speak, but Green Day could be considered the link between the First and Second Wave of pop-punk. Oh and punk-rock is basically just &quot;regular&quot; punk, since punk is just short for punk-rock anyways.</div></div><hr />

Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails could open. Then The Offspring and Alien Ant Farm could take over. Midway through the set Trapt and Sum 41 come out. Then they'd leave and Hoobastank and Fall Out Boy would end up the massive 8 hour set. <br />

What most may not realize is that this concert is going to be a continuation of two other concerts being played at the Hollywood Palladium on the 6th (2 days prior to BlizzCon) and the KROQ Red Bull Sound Space on the 7th that they are streaming online.

Hardly, but if you've actually seen the crowds during any of the Blizzcon shows, you'd know that they are just standing there like mannequins at a store, obviously no one wants them to mosh around, but a little crowd participation is never a bad thing. Also, they had Ozzy play there, moshing is required.<br />

I approve this comment. Really people. Stop bashing other people's tastes in music. If you don't like Blink-182, then don't watch. Or if you keep an open mind and check out the concert, you may like it. It's the whole Green Eggs and Ham scenario. I partly got into the Pop-Punk fad mid-way through. I enjoy listening to Green Day, Blink-182, Offspring. But you will also see that I have other bands on my playlist such a few My Chemical Romance songs or Wheezer. I even have some ska, such as Less Than Jake and The Mighty Mighty Bosstones. Does my eclectic range of music suck. To some, yes. To me, no.</div></div><hr />

Company got them to play for the final night of the retreat for about three hundred middle aged adults, probably between age 40-60 (Kinda lol). They're a fun group live, even though they didn't have Travis. (He evidently doesn't fly any more). The band did try and get the company to pay full price, even though they where missing one member.</div></div><hr />

Oh man, people still think Travis Barker is a good musician? I thought we were past this...<br />
Like Blink-182 if you want, but technical ability on pretty much every instrument is a measurable thing. Songs don't have to have technical parts to be good, but interesting musical parts often require some skill, and Travis Barker has very little outside of cliche 4/4 pop-punk beats.

Than again, one need only look at Chris Metzen to get a fine idea of their taste in both music and uh...well, let's just say taste is not one of their stronger points in much of anything. But at-least they make good games.Or maybe you should be looking at yourself?<br />

For people that don't know they're going to like them, I suggest youtubing some songs from their last ep. It only has 5 songs, I suggest checking out 'Boxing Day, Dogs Eating Dogs, Pretty Little Girl'. Or just listen to all 5 songs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chezwickcheese</div><div class="date">2013-10-31, 09:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Incorrect. I don't really like Blink-182, but they were one of the biggets bands in the 90's and influenced the entire pop-punk genre, for better and for worse, where as Ozzy was struggling to stay even remotely relevant in the 90's.<br />
<br />
Also, skill is stupidly overrated, and impossible to rate as it all revolves about subjectivity, luck and &quot;doing the right thing, and the right time&quot;. Ozzy for example, has never had an ounce of skill when it comes to the vocal department, yet he sounds recognizable and was lucky to work with a bunch of people who could write brilliant songs.<br />
<br />
Besides, your initial point was that since we aren't in the early 90's anymore, Blink should be irrelevant, according to that logic, since we aren't in the early 80's Ozzy should be irrelevant.<br />
<br />
Thank you! I was just about to type this exact reply. <br />
<br />
Ozzy didn't have skill at all! What being blind drunk and moaning into a microphone is skill? Hahaha! You want skill just look at a real rock legend like Angus Young.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Them and Greenday were the most influential punk/pop-punk bands(they've never referred to themselves as punk) of the late 90s/early 2000s. You have no idea what your talking about.<br />
<br />
Like it or not they DO have skill. It's just not in the form of crazy solos and super intricate scales. They have a sound that everyone tried to mimmick but couldn't. Instead of solos they do harmonic interludes, they have a simple style yet it still gets an emotional feeling across.<br />
<br />
Musical tastes are unique, I like Blink, but very few Beatles songs do anything for me.</div></div><hr />

You are over-exaggerating on the word &quot;most.&quot; Most would indicated 75%+ of listeners. However, if you are only including dedicated punk fans (stuff that came out in the 70s, 80s, and early 90s), then maybe.

Assuming they put on a good show, I think people will be pleasantly surprised. They are seasoned musicians/song writers, and I think some of their best songs are their most recent, especially the ones from their latest album(Dogs eating dogs). It's clear that most people in this thread still see Blink as how they were in 2000, they're much different. And their new and improved sound is only now coming together. Tom and Mark split for a while into Angels and Airwaves and +44. Then they got back together and made the album 'Neighborhoods', which they weren't even in the same state, they just sent ideas to eachother. So that album ended up being meh, since it wasn't a true blend of both songwriters. But Dogs eating dogs was made legitly, and it showed. And now they're working on a new full album together, which should be really good.<br />
<br />
I mean, how can you not like this song unless it's just completely opposite of your tastes?: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy3bYIu8ukA&amp;feature=youtube_gdata_player<br />

See its pretty clear that you havnt heard them since they've changed since you think 'they have funny lyrics'. Which I don't blame someone for not following a band they aren't interested in, but it's been about 12 years since they made songs with funny lyrics.</div></div><hr />

Dogs eating Dogs is an EP.. it's like 5 songs.... <br />
They are still pop punk.. they would never leave the popular formula and TBH it's like w/e, given the amazing bands in cali that are punk it's Lulz to call them such. It's apples and oranges ... totally different shit but still fruit. <br />
( they should totally of gotten Broadway Calls if they wanted contemporary pop punk tho) lol<br />

See its pretty clear that you havnt heard them since they've changed since you think 'they have funny lyrics'. Which I don't blame someone for not following a band they aren't interested in, but it's been about 12 years since they made songs with funny lyrics.<br />
<br />
Be fair. the same thing can be said in a way that is not catering to teen boys LOL so it they are a lil weird. I guess for you Pretty little girl is  fucking, fuck PUNK RAWK, rite? lol</div></div><hr />

I don't think they care what genre you put them in. Noone calls them punk other than dumb music media and dumb teenagers. I know Dogs eating dogs is just an ep bit I think it's a good taste of their new style.</div></div><hr />

Blink was more punkish back before the early 2000s when they went more poppy, but now they're rich and every one of you sleaze bags would have done the exact same thing. So you can sit there in your computer chair judging them if you want, but they win by every measure.</div></div><hr />

As much as I like BR, I somehow doubt they would ever agree to something like Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
I could just see Graffin making a statement about the fallacy of peoples hatred of concepts and each other wrought by the purely fictitious factions of WoW, 99% of Blizzcon staring back completely clueless at what he means and the band just walking off the stage in despair.</div></div><hr />

No offense, but poor argument. They had Tenacious D once, the band with arguably the most (all) female, male, transgender, bestial, spherical, transdimensional, cucumber and ethereal/ demonic fans in the universe.</div></div><hr />

Meh, won't be as awesome as Ozzy but I much prefer them over some modern &quot;artist&quot; of today...<br />
<br />
Also for the people saying Ozzy had no skill...what have you amounted to in your time? Not sure how you measure skill but I for one love his singing voice and wouldn't hear ANYONE else sing those songs.<br />
<br />
That wa my point, you can't measure skill as such. And yes Ozzy is awesome and you wouldn't want anyone to sing Ozzy songs because it wouldn't feel right obviously.<br />

lol wut? I was at the blizzcon when Ozzy played, and everyone went nuts! It's was amazing, maybe you're full of it!<br />

Relax there Sir Badass.... I saw the show, or you call that going nuts, then you must live a pretty calm life... Because what the crowd did was *not* going nuts, they barely moved or sang along.</div></div><hr />

And a lot of their music is well written, and meaningful. You probably haven't heard of Angels and Airwaves, the other band that Tom Delong created. they have a very professional feel, and its all really meaningful stuff and 0% childish like the 1990s blink. the 2013 blink has taken alot of AvA's feeling to their music, and all im saying is this years blizzcon is going to be a treat! gonna be great, I cant wait!!! wish I was going :(</div></div><hr />

The only thing I really feel I can trash them for was that they picked up where Green Day left off, and paved the way for Good Charlotte, Simple Plan, and all kinds of god-awful pop-punk that infested the early 2000s. I can only be thankful that a typical punk band's career is barely longer than a rap career.</div></div><hr />

I'm not old, and I'm not a curmudgeon, but this comment makes me want to scream something about how bad the current generations music sucks ass. It's terrible. There's a few artists that actually create art, but the majority of the shit that is on the radio and TV today is absolute garbage. Shit, more than half the artists now don't even write their own stuff.<br />

Not even really SoCal punk legends. When I think of SoCal punk legends, I think of bands like X, Black Flag, Circle Jerks, Agent Orange and Suicidal Tendencies. Maybe even Social Distortion or Bad Religion, but certainly not Blink-182.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BAD RELIGION formed the way for many punk bands.....while i dont like them at all, they had some talent and a true fan base. Would be a MUCH better choice.<br />
<br />
Ahhhh youth. There were so many more punk bands that came out of SoCal that were better than Bad Religion and way more influential. But then again, I guess it's a generational thing. I am not saying that BR is a bad band, but I wouldn't hold them up with the esteem that you two give them.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe they're even a band now, or that anyone likes them.<br />
<br />
Blizzcon's live entertainment has always been pretty bad.<br />
<br />
I mean, they've had some cool ones like Tenacious D, but for every Jack Black they've had, they've had six Goo-Goo Dolls.</div></div><hr />
