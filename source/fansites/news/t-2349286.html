It's only accurate to have the Alliance on top of the Horde. For the Alliance!</div></div><hr />

Maybe even late January/early February (it would match 77 days rule - Antorus was week late because Thanksgiving). It would make sense to release it week/two after LFR, when all can see what happen at the end of the raid (just like Argus on the sky and pre 7.3 quest started day KJ was on LFR).<br />
<br />
Only thing that could delay 7.3.5 is level scalling, it obviously need some testing. But I guess they can just release what they'll have (let's face it, not a lot people will run 50 level dungeon on PTR anyway) and tune it better on live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that they A) Have the reward set up already and B) Are patching it in now suggests that it is coming sooner than whatever the next patch cycle after Kobolds and Catacombs might be. <br />
<br />
The presence of so much allied race data on the WOW PTR also suggests that they are much farther along in the process than we have been told.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It could go either way honestly.<br />
<br />
Hearthstone tends to always get card backs a month or two before they're accessible (See the recent patch also added next month's rank reward), but it could also mean that since they didn't add February, and also didn't hold this card back until adding February, that pre-order might be available before the end of January or into the start of February (Since Decembers was also just added).</div></div><hr />

Alliance gets three reskins...wow!<br />

Alliance gets a shithole like Undercity and plague covered areas surrounding it<br />

To be honest I just want to use the Void Elf heritage armor on my current shadow priest =/ But I can't since it's horde. Don't mind if I had to race change, but faction? Nah :P</div></div><hr />

Nightborne = Night Elves<br />
Zandalari = Troll just stand up straght<br />
HMTauren = Tauren with moose horns.<br />

All are just reskins of current models already in the game. We are not getting new models at all.</div></div><hr />

Having better shit doesn't mean you won. Just looks at the world today, usually it just means you whined more. Plus it is kind of an even trade, we get beautiful Stormwind, Gilneas, Ironforge, etc..., Horde keep their crappy mud huts and some buildings made of wood, and now a burnt down tree and buildings made of rotting wood, it is all perspective. Plus with Sylvanas, most of the Horde areas will be covered in plague soon enough.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, the quote was made long before the wildfire. Plus, the world isn't just the US, and things are pretty much burning, exploding, or otherwise calamity-ing about. There's never a perfect time for something like this.</div></div><hr />
