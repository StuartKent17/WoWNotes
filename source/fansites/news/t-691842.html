Arena Point Wipe Clarification<br />
Arena points were wiped during the recent maintenance following the end of the Arena season on January 19th. We initially intended to launch the next arena season this week, but it was delayed due to the minor content patch that needs to coincide with the beginning of the season having some last minute issues to resolve.<br />
<br />
Due to the delay in the arena season we are in the process of reimbursing arena points to all eligible participants. Characters will be returned to the amount they had on Tuesday, January 26th. All Arena points will then be wiped when season 8 begins. We apologize for the confusion this caused and appreciate your understanding <br />
<br />
2v2 Arena Titles<br />
Select players in the 2v2 bracket were mistakenly awarded end-of-season awards and titles. This was due to a game bug, and not at all intentional. We will be removing the mistaken awards and titles. For some players this will occur upon logging out. For others we will correct the error on the next maintenance period.<br />
<br />
We are very sorry for any inconvenience or confusion this may have caused. <br />

Epic Crafting: Gunship Battle<br />
As the confrontation with the Lich King draws nearer, fire erupts in the skies above Icecrown Citadel. Skybreaker and Orgrim's Hammer, the flag-flying gunships of the Alliance and Horde, clash near Deathbringer's Rise -- but it wasn’t too long ago that they were just ideas on paper. Read on to find out how our development team built this airborne assault: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/gunship-battle.xml<br />

The Night Elf Mohawk Has Packed Up<br />
You’ve pitied and you’ve been pitied, but the time has come for the Night Elf Mohawk to pack up his Mohawk Grenades and move on. You looked goooood while his visit lasted, Azeroth, but his work here is done...for now. <br />
<br />
Plate DPS Classes Using Mail/Leather<br />
We currently understand that plate dps classes are picking up leather and/or mail items as some of them currently work better for their class/spec. This post is a reminder of what we mentioned at BlizzCon 2009. In Cataclysm, plate items will have Strength on them while mail and leather will have Agility and the difference between these items will be greater than they are now. We don’t want anyone who is investing in certain items right now to be disappointed with them when the changes take effect.<br />
<br />
As we have done in previous expansions, we plan to release a patch that updates the game systems shortly before the full expansion content goes live so you will still be experiencing Wrath of the Lich King content with the new stat systems for at least a short period of time. All classes will be changing a lot in Cataclysm and we will announce all of the changes in advance to try and prevent players from being taken by surprise. In the mean time, please make your item selections with both current and future content in mind. <br />
<br />
[...] I wanted to address some of the points that have been brought up in this thread so far.<br />
<br />
The original post was directed at the plate wearers because a mail-based class who is wearing leather going into Cataclysm won’t be at the same disadvantage as a plate-based class who is wearing leather or mail will be.<br />
<br />
For an enhancement shaman or hunter, the mail will lose its Intellect, but the physical dps mail and leather will both have Agility that enhancement shaman and hunters want. However, we are also going to offer a small additional incentive for characters to wear “their” armor so it will encourage shaman and hunters to wear mail over leather, balance druids to want leather over cloth, holy paladins to prefer plate, etc.<br />
<br />
We realize everyone will have lots of questions about what will happen to their gear, and we will eventually share all of that with you. We just wanted to post this reminder for plate wearers who are currently after leather and/or mail items to let them they will really not want it when we convert to the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Part of the Cataclysm re-itemization will be to change all of the old (pre-Wrath of the Lich King) items, which will include doing things like actually having low level balance druid leather or holy paladin plate. <br />
<br />
[...] If you are focused on Icecrown progression right now, as you probably should be, then pick whatever gear makes the most sense for your character. All we wanted to point out is that once we get closer to Cataclysm, all of your gear is going to change. In most cases, a good piece will still be good for you. In the dps warrior, paladin and DK case, the now +Agility leather and mail you might be wearing will be bad for you. If you plan to keep raiding after the conversion, that might be a problem. If you planned to use your Icecrown gear to help you level in Cataclysm, that might be a problem. It's just a public service announcement for players who might not be familiar with the Catalcysm stats plan.<br />
<br />
[...] The intention isn't to have people change their bidding/rolling habits right now. If the item is an upgrade right now for current content you should probably go for it.<br />
<br />
The intention is to make sure players know that the leather/mail items probably won't be very useful when we do reach Cataclysm so having some extra plate items as backups will probably be more helpful than another abyss crystal at that point in time. Cataclysm is not right around the corner but if you are using (just tossing a number out there) 8 leather items, replacing all of them may take more than a couple weeks.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard loves mail/leather classes - 2 of each (sham + hunter or druid + rogue) who won't have any sort of competition for certain gearslots anymore (armor, weapons, thrown(only applies for hunters/rogues), rings, necks) while there are 3 plate DPS classes who will have to share armor necks rings cloaks weapons add nauseum, which are sure to be not itemized as good as leather/mail if it had AP instead of extra Agi and 1 Agi = 1 AP for leather/mail wearers instead of 2 like it will be in Cat.<br />

Maybe if they itemized plate gear better, plate users wouldn't roll on leather/mail. That has always been the answer to this problem. Yet Blizz repeats the same thing over and over.<br />
<br />
<br />
A sophisticated and less effective way is to re-itemize gear. They somehow seemingly approached this right when they finally decided to remove ap, sp and mp5 from gear.<br />
<br />
A simple and much more effective way, is to only allow plate class wear plate, mail class wear mail etc, and remove lv40 armor skill upgrade.(this is possible because cataclysm will overhaul the old content)</div></div><hr />

<br />
spellpower for every X armor for example in the druid balance and/or resto tree for example thereby giving them an incentive to wear leather over cloth.<br />
<br />
either that or they might actually take the plunge and just remove the wearing of alternative armor types from classes altogether in Cata.<br />
<br />
tbh it's an pretty archaic mechanic (what with some classes having way more options than others) with its roots in the games original development which does very little except cause loot drama and piss people off.<br />
<br />
<br />
from Blizzards PoV they actually want to be able to predict what people will be wearing (within reasonably tight tolerances) when they reach a certain point in order to balance encounters and classes comparative dps in those encounters.<br />
<br />
and there's a lot of stuff coming in Cata that's designed to simplify and make Blizzards job easier when it comes to balancing the game so they can get on with other more interesting stuff (the mastery system and the fact we are all gonna end up with comparable health values regardless of class for example) that combined with the stat system changes basically represent a complete overhaul of the games baseline mechanics in order to make it easier for them to manage.<br />
<br />
if i works it could be awesome.<br />
<br />
i for one would rather see patches with content, bug fixes and additions to the game rather than the constant lists of class tweaks which for the part 5 years have been the majority of the work they have been doing and i think so too do they because in the end that isn't really game design...</div></div><hr />

Well anyhow, the change they're refering to is that come cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Agility will be pointless for Warriors, paladins and deathknights.<br />
<br />
and strenght will be pointless for rogues, shamans and hunters. (prob druids as well)<br />
<br />
this is because attackpower will be removed, and agility will grant 2 AP per point to rogues, shamans and hunters. <br />
<br />
And strenght will do the same for warriors, paladins and deathknights.<br />
<br />
This is why blizzard have decided to warn their players that come cataclysm, dps items with agility and AP, will have only agility, and therefor be absolutely pointless for plate dps :P<br />

How one can not understand this simple point is beyond me, but that's all they're saying.</div></div><hr />

I think he means the 25 player Heroic version for the strongest form or a hard mode of some kind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rogues - Leather only<br />
Warr - mail only till 40 then plate only, etc<br />
<br />
If there is a problem with lack of options, then that should be solved by better itemization or more options given from Blizz. <br />
<br />
<br />
You gotta be kidding me. What cloth armor is flying around with stats like agility/AP/crit/... ? Rogues can pretty much use leather only allready.<br />
<br />
And about the armor lock for classes, that pretty bad idea. That would mean we would all have the gear designed for all class/spec combos (not taking into account sharing gear among some of them). That could be achieved (and probably also will as they will design boomkin low lvl gear for example) but would cut you from upgrading when noone wants that item, yet you could use it - aka wasted items once you get your one<br />
<br />
Having +bonus when wearing the armor type you are supposed (or -bonus when not, up to your taste), is much better idea, letting you still go for upgrade in other armor type - in other words that +bonus would solve that armor of same ilvl(tier, level of gear generally) your armor class would be promoted and you would go for it, but if you are undergeared you could use that item too (missing +bonus and having other armor type would be more than your actually worn item)</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has already implemented the bonus to ap from armor value to push warriors towards Plate, however, some of us actually spend time itemizing our gear to get the desired balance between strength/crit/armor pen/hit/haste/expertise.<br />
<br />
We all know that Leather gear will generally have more hit/crit as rogues and ferals are in higher need of those stats. There are select few pieces of Leather gear that are actually viable for a high end raiding Warrior above the plate that will drop eventually. With that being said, allowing a class to wear more than one gear type actually helps to benefit the raid more than some of you give credit too. If there were only 2 Plate gloves that dropped in all of ICC, one with haste/arp one with crit/hit, would you not want to take the Leather gloves that have ArP/Crit? Yes, you may lose approx 80ap, but the 5% ArP and close to 2% Crit from agility will more than make up for it. <br />
<br />
ICC is pretty demanding on DPS, and waiting for a single specific drop to increase personal DPS can sometimes take months. We already have these issues with weapons and trinkets (which are the most important pieces of gear for Warriors). These items have the highest single DPS increases over the random boss loots, however there are always 6-7 others in raid who are looking for the same thing. <br />
<br />
Personally I enjoyed my leather gear through SSC/TK, and will continue to do so if I can itemize efficiently to wear it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For example, if a Cloth piece drops, a mage, a shammy and a pally want it (the latter two for healing purposes), the mage would get it by default as they can not request mail or plate and the latter two have more options (plate, mail, leather and cloth) they could use.</div></div><hr />

Yet at the same time, an equivalent mail piece may simply not exist or there's only 1 option compared to 3 or 4 cloth options. Say, an elemental piece. At best it may be a resto piece but I'm assuming that the resto shaman has automatic priority on it due to the mp5 since mp5 provides no dps gain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this.<br />
my guild even support the idea of giving cloth to cloth wearer, yet there are VERY few or almost non existent equivalent mail gear.<br />
<br />
speaking of elemental shaman of course.</div></div><hr />
