arena should be clear open, no pillar, no rock, nothing at all, pure skill and not go to hide behind anything</div></div><hr />

What you need to put effort into is either learning exactly how it works or put effort into realizing that you just don't know anything about video game development.<br />
There is not a single dev who puts time into organizing e-sport events. Unless they're really fan of e-sports and want to get implicated so they do it on their own time but the company is not sacrificing dev ressources to push more on e-sports.</div></div><hr />

<br />
is that a joke? there would be less &quot;skill&quot; involved if line of sight was not a part of the equation. strategic positioning and enemy awareness ≠ hiding.</div></div><hr />

No, but they are paying someone to do it. That money could probably be spent better elsewhere.<br />

No, but again - Blizzard does pay them.</div></div><hr />

After all these things there is still a lot of money left. It,s not, and never was, a question of where to put the money, cuz they could put it in both without any problems. You can't have an infinite number of people working on the same things. Not to mention we have reached a point where some people say they can't keep up with the content release pace, that's one sign that you're reaching a point where doing more isn't the most profitable. And on top of that you need place to put all these employees, gotta manage all that, etc.<br />
<br />
Ressources are not just numbers that can be changed like a character stats in a game. There's a lot more going on behind the scene that both requires a minimum amount of people to make things go smooth and also constraints to a maximum so it stays manageable and productive without stepping on each others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm sure. Still, the way I see it, it's wasted effort. Effort and resources better put into other things.<br />
Also, there is hardly that much more content in this expansion. It's just that you have to do the same content over and over again leading to the worst expansion Blizzard ever released.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cæli</div><div class="date">2018-01-12, 10:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This forced business goes against the idea of making games to experience creative talent, and instead promote the idea of making meaningless games to be forgotten in an history of endless and pointless entertainment for generations to come. At least shows like AGDQ is showing historical and actually good games which is the point if there's one for the viewer. WoW deserves better.<br />
<br />
This was maybe a bit harsh to say, but I'll add that esport is meant to be a social thing, there's at least that, there's good in social sometimes, but doesn't have much to do with the value in video games.</div></div><hr />

I'm not big on 3s as an e-sport but watching m+ would be like watching paint dry.. <br />
<br />
Waaaaaayyyy less skill involved in m+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
veryyyyyyy true! very very true. I'd say lower the arena tournaments, increase maybe pvp BG tournaments, M+ invitational and raids?<br />
<br />
They can most definitely build a model where they have e.g a 5 bosses raid and invite the 10 best guilds in the world to compete in there using a tournament realm with noone having advantage in farming etc and being able to stream the whole tournament. I think though Blizz is quite bad when it comes to tournaments, their team is just not good as in other companies and games thats why dota and lol has overtaken their world.</div></div><hr />

You know, I'd MUCH rather watch RBG tournaments over arena tournaments. Things are so much better when there's an objective beyond &quot;kill the other team&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
More than anything it goes to show how WoW combat is not suited for PvP, and was never originally intended for it. Even SWTOR had better PvP combat.</div></div><hr />

pvp is balanced around 3s. they would have nervous breakdowns if they had to balance pvp around RBGS.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Strategic positioning and ennemy awarness&quot;<br />
<br />
What a pretentious way to say &quot;HUMP DA PILLARZ”<br />
<br />
Arena arento amdigshit level for amlong time now. You either play cleave burst or fatigue grind comp, no point in trying tomsell it as &quot;skilled&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ZettZu</div><div class="date">2018-01-17, 09:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">there was a reason i put &quot;skill&quot; in quotations. i don't really see it as a skill, but it definitely takes more awareness than standing and stabbing each other in the middle of a circle. and the only characters that constantly stand by pillars are healers, and they have to be more aware of where everyone is on both teams than anyone else. otherwise they would be standing in the middle hitting two buttons.<br />
<br />
it doesn't matter how balanced or mechanically &quot;difficult&quot; they designed pvp. if there wasn't an environment you could use to your advantage, pvp would be horrendous.</div></div><hr />
