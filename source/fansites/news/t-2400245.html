Glowcap Festivalglowcap<br />
Glowcap Festival (http://www.wowdb.com/world-events/648-glowcap-festival) allows players to help keep Fshoo (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/118509-fshoo) alive in Sporeggar to earn reputation. <br />
<br />
<br />
Head to Sporeggar in Zangarmarsh to take part in this holiday. <br />
Mushrooms will spawn around the town, giving you Glowcap (http://www.wowdb.com/items/24245-glowcap) and other helpful items:<br />
<br />
Sack of Healing Spores (http://www.wowdb.com/items/144276-sack-of-healing-spores) - Channeled heal for Fshoo.<br />
Sporeggium (http://www.wowdb.com/items/144261-sporeggium) - 2% healing buff per stack. Stacks to 100 times. <br />
Rimecap (http://www.wowdb.com/items/144265-rimecap) - Stop all damage and growth for 3 seconds, allowing healers to catch up.<br />
Fungal Lifestalk (http://www.wowdb.com/items/144262-fungal-lifestalk) - Instant 5% heal for Fshoo.<br />
<br />
You can purchase all four of the items above from Mycah (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/18382-mycah), the Sporeggar Quartermaster.<br />
You can also loot a Pungent Truffle (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235264-pungent-truffle), allowing you to transform into a sporeling for 24 hours.<br />
Fshoo spawns periodically, gaining stacks of Fshoo Grow (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/235202-fshoo-grow). Each stack increases his size by 1% and health by 100%. <br />
Fshoo also loses health at a constant rate, making him harder and harder to heal as the grow stacks appear. <br />
Using the items and healing him to keep him alive as long as possible is the objective.<br />
When Fshoo dies he will give everyone 50 Sporeggar reputation for every stack of the buff he had. <br />
<br />

<br />
&quot;Every&quot; expansion? She did nothing in Vanilla, had ONE quest in TBC, played a part of the Wrathgate and 2 out of 3 ICC instances. She did nothing in Cata, nothing in MoP aside from a single fight in SoO. Did anothing in WoD. It wasn't until Legion where she really started to have a major role, and outside a few quests in Stormheim she wasn't even that big a deal and so far aside from the two intro BfA fights (Teldrassil/Undercity) she's not even that much in this expansion either.</div></div><hr />

Yes but I am a hipster contrarian and since she is popular I automatically hate her. Please understand, this makes me better than the people who love her for no good reason.</div></div><hr />
