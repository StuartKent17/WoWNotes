Twin-Pipe Buster Cannon (https://www.wowdb.com/items/165600-twin-pipe-buster-cannon) bonus effect damage has been increased by 83%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: While iterating on itemization feedback, we discovered that the Buster Cannon’s effect had been tuned low. This should make it more competitive with other ranged weapons at similar item levels. Should you wish to restore a deleted Twin-Pipe Buster Cannon, please use our Item Restoration website: https://battle.net/support/restoration<br />

Was world PvP detected and the developers found the need to kill it?</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but killing people that are probably having not even have the possibility of react because they are still loading. This is not world-pvp, this is simply ganking.<br />
<br />
But: why is it even possible? Is honorless target no longer active? Ganking flight points should simply be not possible. Just add 30 seconds honorless target (and remove any conquest gained with it) after somebody lands at the flight point (and resurrect from it's corpse).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is already the case for landing at a Flight Path at least, unless you use an offensive spell even if it's to get away directed at the opposing faction (e.g. Frost Nova or Psychic Scream). Then it will remove Honorless Target.</div></div><hr />

Yes, &quot;world PvP&quot;. A raid of 20+ people instagibbing a single player coming out of AFK and/or loading screen, or in any case entirely unprepared for an onslaught. Exactly what I had in mind when I turned on War Mode!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honorless Target doesn't punish you, it just doesn't reward you. In other words, it doesn't stop you from killing people at the FP, even if only every 3rd gives you a HK because he managed to cast something before he died.</div></div><hr />

Srsly only took 6 weeks of live to realise it was useless, 83% buff is a bit more than just tuned low, more like it was never tested at all, Blizz 2019 leaving things until its too late, welcome to BFA Beta or should it be Alpha.</div></div><hr />

honorless targets still give credit for the alliance free loot quest,so they don't care</div></div><hr />

You should have :P That’s essentially what world pvp is.<br />
(Obviously I’m being sarcastic but a little honest lol)<br />

Too late is a bit of a stretch...</div></div><hr />

More like people were being instagibbed the moment they landed by a mob of players mindlessly pressing buttons.</div></div><hr />
