This means that almost all of the 1.2 million Annual Pass holders have now been invited to beta!<br />
<br />
We’ve sent the remaining 400,000 Annual Pass beta invites last night, which concludes the entirety of those who have signed up for the offer thus far. Of course the Annual Pass offer is still available (http://us.media.blizzard.com/wow/promotion/wap/en-us.html), providing those who sign up for a year of World of Warcraft with a special in-game mount, a beta invite for Mists of Pandaria, and a digital copy of Diablo III (http://www.battle.net/d3/). From here on out we’ll be continuing to invite anyone else who signs up for the Annual Pass.<br />
<br />
See you in Pandaria (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/mists-of-pandaria/)!<br />
<br />
[edit] Due to the large number of invites sent there are some that bounced back for various reasons, and we'll be working to apply those invites over the next few days. If you haven't received your invite yet it's likely you're one of the few affected by such an issue, and rest assured we're working to get you into the beta as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also realize that a good 50% won't even bother with the beta, and another 20% on to that won't log on to the beta more then a few minutes.<br />
<br />
Then cut that up like crazy based on people's schedules, what they want to do in beta, timezones, etc and the number is far lower then you would think.</div></div><hr />

Edit: 275,000 invites takes roughly 28 hours to send them all out, how long do you think 400,000 will take?</div></div><hr />

<br />
A few have been.<br />
<br />
Honestly, with how many people have the annual pass, I think you're probably shit out of luck if you didn't get it.<br />
<br />
Also, I wonder how long it'll take for all these invites to REALLY be out. Still waiting on mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They just went out. It will take up to 24 hours (yes an entire day) for it to show up on your battle.net page, it is technically impossible for it to show up on everyone's at once. Unless you want the beta servers, website, and WoW servers to crash for hours because of the loading going on.</div></div><hr />

You should get it soon. It will take a while for them to all go out and flag the accounts. They sent them last night and mine didn't come until this morning.</div></div><hr />

If you're an AP holder, your account would be active. If it is currently not active, you no longer have AP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If your account isn't active then the Annual Pass is no longer active. If it has been inactive for a long time then you no longer have the Annual Pass. If it just became inactive the past day or two send in a ticket or call CS to have it resolved and reactivate your account.<br />
<br />
If you don't want to reactivate your account then tough luck, because that was the entire point of the AP.</div></div><hr />

Don't expect opt-ins to get in until beta realms have calmed down quite a bit. It could be over a month until that happens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry if this sounds a bit rude but: FOR GOD'S SAKE THE NEWS IS NOT EVEN AN HOUR OLD.<br />
<br />
ok, so give it time - the invites were sent out, it will take approximately 12 hours for every account to be flagged, to be safe give it 24 and I'm sure you will be able to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just today I only expect 20-25% of the number to even log in to the beta realms, and that is probably higher then reality. Depending on the capacity of the beta realms it could still be fairly flooded.</div></div><hr />

If you really want beta you still have the option to sign up for the Annual Pass before May 1st. If you don't want to do that then it is entirely luck of the draw.</div></div><hr />

Have to remember that not everyone who got beta access uses it. Most all of our guild who got it cause of AP haven't even downloaded it. That's about 20+ people. We aren't the only guild who jumped ship months ago and don't plan on trying MoP. &gt;.&gt;<br />

see, my problem with this is that i don't want to pay for a beta access (which is essentially what i see the annual pass as). i will have D3 on launch day anyhow (Collector Edition has already been reserved for me at the local store) and i didn't pay for it 5 months in advance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You aren't paying a single cent if you plan on playing WoW for the next year. They still withdraw money at monthly, 3 month, or 6 month intervals based on how you subscribed. You actually save money if you plan on getting Diablo 3, and if you get the Collectors Edition with the AP you are only technically paying $40 for the collectors as you will get four months free time in World of Warcraft to make up for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Give it some time peeps, the flooding will get better, the servers will become more stable, the crashes will be ironed out. And before you can say Brewmaster we will have an awesome expansion. :)</div></div><hr />

ok, so give it time - the invites were sent out, it will take approximately 12 hours for every account to be flagged, to be safe give it 24 and I'm sure you will be able to play.They were sent out over 17 hours ago?</div></div><hr />

Went and had a quick look at it, <br />
couldnt get past 3rd quests, so many people trying to burn the item at the top of the temple, some tried queuing, others just grouped round it spamming some sort of command. gave up. logged off. Glad I am done with PTR now.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We’ve sent the remaining 400,000 Annual Pass beta invites last night, which concludes the entirety of those who have signed up for the offer thus far.&quot;</div></div><hr />

When people were initially complaining that all 1 million+ AP holders didn't get their beta invites immediately, this was *exactly* the sort of thing they were told would happen. And yet the complaints continued incessantly. Now that they've sent out the invites and these issues are coming up, all I can say is: &quot;Hahaha ahahaha, haha ahaha...ha.&quot; ( &lt;---- best if read in the Joker's voice)</div></div><hr />

3.beta is beta, yes the servers are going to be overloaded and buggy and laggy, but this is how they test capacity. When all the kids that think this is a sneak-peak at endgame get bored and go off to play stable cata, things will calm down and we can do what we need to do. Test.</div></div><hr />

&quot;People purchasing the AP AFTER Beta started should not be getting any Beta access at ALL. Not only do they get access but many of them got access before people like me who purchased it 6 months ago.All these perks were dangled in our face with the implication that they were a limited time offer but they did not turn out to be true at all. Yet Blizzard was able to save face with their most recent subscription numbers because so many people rushed to take advantage of what was implied to be a limited time offer&quot;<br />
<br />
That right there earned me a ban. No warning, nothing. I just notice my post was deleted and went to post something different and got the notice I was banned. I avoid the official forums for a lot of reasons and have never had any action taken against my account, forum or game, ever by Blizz so it's not like I'm some repeat offender.<br />

Sooo.. You wen't into a beta then were surprised when it was a beta?<br />
<br />
Videos almost always go in near the end<br />
Missing Art Work almost always goes in at the end, all the quest items in Cata looked just like this.<br />
<br />
Not starting in the actual starting zone What? You mean the start up quests from the home town? You were supposed to be testing the Pandaria zones/quests only.<br />
<br />
spells bugged out the ass A lot of changes going in, spells are going to be bugged, they don't take much effort to get fixed.<br />

Idk man, you list nothing but stuff that are very quick fixes. You act like you were expecting a beta, yet you are surprised by it being a beta, I don't understand your awful, flawed logic.<br />

that was just a quick list off the top of my head I'm not &quot;surprised&quot; by any of it. I just though it would have a lot more polish by now or I could at least complete the MOP starting zone quest chains. I'm not a video game tester, I've never been in a beta, and I have no idea what goes into coding these games nor the amount of time it takes to fix anything. It makes perfect sense if you step back a second, there is no need to be angry.</div></div><hr />

Generally the build we're playing is sometimes one or even two versions behind what the developers are working on. So they will push out a new build and as if by magic, lots more things will be enabled and lots of bugs fixed. There are still a couple of months minimum left on the beta, plenty of time for features to be opened up. Blizzard are pro's at this. By the time the beta closes, it will all be polished and nice.</div></div><hr />

It's not raging. I stated a legitimate complaint and I got banned for it. I was not obscene or vulgar or anything like that. There are literally thousands of people upset for the exact same reasons I am and their are numerous threads and posts on both official and unofficial forums saying as much. <br />
<br />
Many people like myself were led to believe by Blizzard that the perks that come with the AP were a limited time offer. Not only did that not end up being true but the system Blizzard used for the Beta invites is severally broken. All sorts of people were getting Beta invites in earlier waves that had newer game accounts and/or had just recently purchased the AP over people with older game accounts who purchased AP as soon as it was available.<br />
<br />
With that said I wanted to take the time to warn people here that they should be careful about what they post on the official forums as Blizzard is swinging the ban hammer really hard right now.</div></div><hr />

People are either lying/trolling or checking their emails but not their battlenet accounts. I got my invite in the second wave and I didn't get my email confirming my invitation until 24 hours after I had already downloaded the beta client online after logging into battlenet.</div></div><hr />

I know where to check, I have been checking my battle net many many times every time a wave goes out but I am also one of the people who was affected by this bug - http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3553415461?page=1 and now it's fixed it seems a case of wait and see when invites are sent out.</div></div><hr />

No, I'm just stating that some of us do regularly check both our emails and battle.net accounts for these things. Not everyone is &quot;Trolling/Not checking their accounts&quot;<br />
Also if you scrolled to the side you can see that I am in fact enrolled in AP.</div></div><hr />

I've been checking both my email and my battlenet everyday and still no beta. Not everyone lies or trolls. <br />

I'll apologize as soon as people stop crying foul about invitation process. I get people are legitimately upset and their patience is wearing thin, but if I have to see another whine post on the front page, I'm going to gauge my eyes out. Putting my foot in my mouth and calling you a troll/liar isn't anywhere near as embarrassing as someone in the last wave coming here to start yet another loud QQ/rage thread only to later find a beta invitation in their email/b.net account. Not saying the latter is you, but keep your eyes peeled. Someone will do it. MMO-Champion is good for one of these every day.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard can choke on its own vomit at this point as far as I am concerned. This whole experience proved to me it considers me as one of its least important customers. It is &quot;supposedly&quot; the last wave and I am STILL not invited. (I just checked my b.net account) If I am even invited at all, I will probably be the last person in this &quot;last&quot; wave.<br />
<br />
See, PFloydWall? Right on cue. :p<br />
<br />
But you're right, not everyone coming on here voicing they still have not received their invitation is a troll/liar. I get that you're all still upset that you haven't seen your invitations yet and are trying to remain patient with both the process and with Blizzard like any reasonable and level-headed customer would. I apologise. The sheer amount of rage and frivolous complaints both here and on Blizzard's forums has left me feeling a bit asshatty lately :(</div></div><hr />

You are no more important than any other person either. It goes both ways.<br />
<br />
I have been in the beta since the first 100k were sent out, and I have played about 3 hours total. It is a total disaster. Thousands of people every place you go. Nearly impossible to actually do anything. Soon as you get the beta the only thing your going to be doing is raging on the forums how overcrowded it is followed up by a giant QQ rant about how the log in servers are broken.<br />
<br />
<br />
This beta is a bigger waste of time than complaining on the forums about not getting your invite yet.</div></div><hr />

Amen to that. I've only logged 90 minutes of time on the beta so far for the same reason. <br />
<br />
There will be people who legitimately want to test and check out the new features to provide feedback and those who just want to dick around for the sake of being in beta. The latter will gradually dwindle in number when they get bored with the social aspect of it. I'm not going to bother testing until the beta population stabilizes.</div></div><hr />

Don't get your pants in a bunch, it takes a while for their system to flag accounts for Beta it is not an instant process. Calm down, have some dip.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I agree. It's a massive amount of people, so much lag everywhere you go pretty much. Perhaps they are testing server strain, who knows? Would be good to see them bringing new servers soon anyway.<br />
Edit: To change my post for the quote below of me, I ain't exactly having massive lag, more spikes every now and then due to the amount of players. Might just be my laptop can't handle it though.</div></div><hr />

Over 1 million people to mess around on 4 servers is ridiculous, and it's going to be hard to actually test the content going out when I can't even do quests because of so many people.

With Blizzard clearly favoring the alliance over the horde, and so many other &quot;issues&quot; with this expansion, I've been seeing so many people quit the game, or at least reroll and sell their main characters to try and get some money out of the time they've invested in the game over the years. As they see themselves quitting after they try this pokemon xpac and if they took their mains into the xpac, they wouldn't be worth a third as much as they are now. <br />
<br />
Thank god its good for my business, I've had so many top end players sell their accounts to me lately. It seems all the best players know the smart thing to do in times like this.<br />
<br />
I have seen more people coming back and logging on more than ever. Guild is full of activity every night, like 2x over T11 and T12.<br />
<br />
Also, writing in blue font makes you cool I heard. Oh and the QQ over alliance and &quot;Pokemon&quot; just makes your troll status and pretend account selling services pretty obvious.<br />
<br />
Well that and it doesn't take a genius to understand that if all these players are selling their accounts because MoP is so bad, then who exactly are you selling them to, making &quot;business good&quot;...... from the sounds of it you are at a minimum a moron to be buying a bunch of accounts no one wants. lol...so yeh, you did not think that troll through did ya? herp..<br />
<br />
You are like some car dealer who finds out a new model coming out sucks and no one wants it, so you go and buy every one from the maker so you can sell it yourself.. SMART</div></div><hr />

Now I am not nor was I one of the ppl but if you have tried to download the beta or have seen the forum posts of the several thousand that cannot you will realize being invited and getting on it are much different things.</div></div><hr />

We all know betas are now a PR tool on top of having a testing purpose. <br />

Could it be that the lack of new content in Cataclysm until MoP comes out is hurting subscriptions and thus the MoP beta is supposed to fill in the gap?</div></div><hr />

Imagine if our credit cards &quot;bounced&quot; like blizzard beta invites what would happen. The tolerance of some of the people here for sheer incompetence on blizzard's part is mind numbing.<br />
<br />
I have AP<br />
I have an active subscription<br />
I never had a disciplinary action taken against my account (not even 3hr ban)<br />
I don't have a billing dispute with them.<br />

So why the hell do I not have a beta invite? Blizzard incompetence. I don't excuse being invited essentially dead last among a community of 1.2 million people.</div></div><hr />

It would seem, though, that if the amount of accounts on the list is finite, as it seems that it is, someone would HAVE to be last, just as someone would have to have been first.<br />

This is not correct. If you don't have money on the account when blizzard renews your subscription, the account goes inactive. I know someone who had an inactive account a while after getting AP, and then when activating it again the AP also goes active again.</div></div><hr />

What are the odds of being essentially dead last from a community of 1.2 million people? I suspected I was gonna get screwed by blizzard and various idiots kept telling me to &quot;be patient&quot;.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">joshuadamon</div><div class="date">2012-04-22, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">*Sigh* So sick of reading people bitching about breach of contract. For like, the 10 millionth time, they have breached nothing. It says clearly that terms may change at any time with no warning. It also doesn't say when you will be invited to the beta, just that you will. I have my invite and can't get past the servers being red. NO, it's not my battletag. NO, it's not my password. NO, it's not my launcher. I've done every single thing all of you have said. But like any TRUE beta, shit fucks up. A good half of those invited will never log in once do to tech issues. Just the facts. Also, you were paying for WoW anyway. You are lucky you are getting anything additional for the price. They don't have to give you shit besides access to the regular game for your money so shut the fuck up you whiny bitches. I almost never post on these things but for fucks sake, it's old. We know you're pissed you're not a panda yet. We know you like to bitch cuz you have nothing else to do. We know you are either a scrawny lil kid who gets his ass whooped daily so likes to act they have have a big pair of balls when on here where nobody can see what a lil shit you are OR a fat balding man with no woman, no friends and no life who likes to share his misery with others. Grow up, stop complaining and do something beneficial for society, like stop wasting our air with your fucking baseless idiotic complaints. Have a coke and a smile....</div></div><hr />

First off you're a fucking moron if you think Blizzard doesn't owe us anything for locking into paying them 15 bucks a month for a year when Dragon Soul sucks ass and they gave us a terrible end exp boss that is essentially a 3 min fight repeated 4 times with minimal changes. In case anyone feels like calling me out to say yeah on normal it sucks, I'm 8/8H and heroic isn't any less boring than normal and here's my armory to prove I have heroic down. <br />

<br />
Secondly they said &quot;EVERY AP HOLDER WILL GET IN&quot; yet there are still people sitting here without a beta invite even though they have &quot;Sent out all the 1.2 million AP invites.&quot; Now I got over the wave bullshit after the first two waves eluded me, but come to find out that they are still having problems getting people invites from the first wave because of the wow2 ptr bs or whatever is really happening is beyond stupid. They have had 4 weeks to get that issue taken care of. So far it has been a few days since they have said anything regarding the &quot;lucky few&quot; bounce backs. That leads me to believe they are taking their sweet ass time fixing it or not doing anything at all because hey a few thousand or whatever the number is out of 1.2 mill isn't so bad.....<br />
<br />
Thirdly none of use are bitching because we are fat,bald, and have no lives. We are bitching because there are 1.2 million people who all are paying the EXACT same amount of money for a service and not every single one of us have been given the service we were promised, maybe if D3 was out no one would give a fuck but seeing as it's a few weeks away we could be doing stuff like testing out new classes, trying out monks, or any number of things on the mop beta. Half the people will probably do nothing constructive to help Blizzard tweak the classes but here's a post I made the first week after a friend of mine was kind enough to let me play on his account for a bit when he got his invite. Just in case you felt like calling me out again.<br />
