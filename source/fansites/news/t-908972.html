<br />
It's in Anaheim every year because the convention is staffed by blizzard employees, which live in Irvine. Any farther and most of the staff would not be able to attend. Same reason it's not on the east coast at all. The cost per ticket then would be insane. since we'd effectively have to pay for everyone's housing/travel.</div></div><hr />

I'll laugh when they announce that the tickets will have the buyers name on them and his ID will be needed for entrance. And then they allow cancellation, for a refund of only like 50 bucks.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't It Blizzard during the 2 last Blizzcon's that said &quot;Were attempting to get more &amp; more people&quot; &amp; this time &quot;Were attempting to rinse the cash cow, before WoW dies ofc&quot;<br />
Though not entirely accurate, seems about right.<br />
<br />
In case you have missed the news of the few last years..there have been Blizzcons before and even the concept of selling you an Internet stream of the thingy for 30 Dollars isn't entirely new. That and the hint is in the word &quot;BLIZZcon&quot;, not &quot;WoWcon&quot; has nothing to do with &quot; rinse the cash cow, before WoW dies&quot; - Blizzard made money before WoW and will do afterwards.<br />
<br />
175$ for being there live is just as much out of the question for me as 30$ for the stream - wonder how if the community can take the fact that I am a poster who just says &quot;this is too expensive to be worth my while&quot; and not go into a rant how Blizzard is milking everything.<br />
<br />
Guys...check the country you live in. Chances are it is a country you love and which system you love. Chances is..it is a capitalistic system and you are living the capitalistic dream every day of your life. So stop being all bleeding heart and socialist all the sudden. Please.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well as Activision and Blizzard make around 4 billion dollars a year, im sure a few hundred thousand dollars is a drop in the ocean. Speculate to accumulate.<br />
<br />
I for one think 175 dollars is a stupid price, when you consider what you actually get for your money. What will they actually show that we don't already know? 2010 was the biggest letdown, because they had nothing new to show anyone. Cataclysm details were already out, SC2 was launched and D3 only had 3 hours of press and one of those was artwork and soundtrack.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drummerboy</div><div class="date">2011-05-21, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I refreshed my page after turning to 10:00:00 and I was already 800th in queue. Took about 5 minutes to get to the front of the queue. Anyway a success. If you want to buy tickets do the following for the next sale.<br />
1. Be signed into the Blizzard store already with your credentials. This will expedite the process.<br />
2. Make sure your computer clock is synced with an Internet Atomic Clock. Typically time the tickets go on sale is controlled by servers and not by a person that flicks a switch. Adjusting your time can be done by entering your Time settings. There is typically some &quot;sync with Internet&quot; button or check box available where you can set your time. I recommend doing this shortly before the sale starts. Typically most web servers (including Blizzard's) will have their time synced with the Atomic Clocks.<br />
3. Load up the ticket purchasing page prior to the sale starting. When you get within a couple minutes of the sale starting refresh once every 15 seconds. As you get closer to the exact sale time refresh more frequently. Within the last 10 seconds you should be refreshing after each page reload until the page changes to click to purchase.<br />
4. Profit! Well actually you're out $175 but its still a win.</div></div><hr />

Don't presume to judge people, many of them look forward to this as an annual event, a couple of my friends included. And to be honest, $175 is not a lot of money for a 2 day event... but then again we all have different perspectives, and I suppose it depends on what type of income level you have.<br />

Well it is not just the 175, you also need a place to stay and you need to drink/eat.<br />

Wasn't It Blizzard during the 2 last Blizzcon's that said &quot;Were attempting to get more &amp; more people&quot; &amp; this time &quot;Were attempting to rinse the cash cow, before WoW dies ofc&quot;<br />
Though not entirely accurate, seems about right.<br />
<br />
no actually from what i read they dont allow you sell the tickets on ebay lol, your tickets are assigned to your bnet account and you have to show ID with the name on the ticket email. That alone will allow more people that actually want to go rather then people buying them up and selling them for 600$+.. and 25$ more really isnt something to cry about, costs go up every year, and they put a lot of money into this event. Plus it is a freaking 2 day event, ive been to 1 day concerts that cost more then that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
umm there is usually a band there, there is prizes, contests, blizzard games setup they usually let you test out all the upcoming games, hence this year will most likely be the next sc2 expansion, Diablo 3 and other stuff. Some people just love to go do those kind of things, dress up, meet other people , meet the developers it is a really awesome atomosphere.<br />

I'm gonna buy 4 tickets and then sell 'em on eBay for more than 175$ each :).<br />
<br />
U cant sell them on ebay anymore. The tickets are bound to your Bnet account and ID matching the ticket is required. This was one of there big pushes to get more fans to go tot he invent and not ticket scammers.</div></div><hr />

If I lived in southern California, I'd probably go every year since it'd be much, much easier (airfare is usually about $400-500 of the cost including all the extraneous fees (baggage, parking, etc)). I don't know... maybe it's a higher sense of &quot;fiscal responsibility&quot; or it might just be that I'm comparing things logically... like what else could I do with $1000? Last year, I put the money into a revamp of a home theater system :p.<br />
<br />
I'll probably just get the virtual ticket again and curse the terrible stream quality just like the past two years.<br />

<br />
The person that sells the ticket does have to pick the ticket up; however, the person can just give the convention badge to someone else. It would be incredibly slow if they checked convention badges against IDs... especially when thousands are trying to enter early in the morning :p.</div></div><hr />

I paid 30CHF which equals to about $34 for 3 days of Geneva Motorshow, I know it's not exactly the same, but I would guess I see more interesting stuff at the motor show as I see on Blizzcon, including press conferences, unveiling, prototypes and all the other stuff which comes with it, yet it's alot cheaper. <br />

Well You obviously like cars, and some like blizzard that is just how it goes. The event is for people that love the company. The whole company puts a lot of effort into the event and it costs them millions and millions of $$ They usually dont make profit on it, its more for showing off there product and what blizzard is all about, the CEO talks about how expensive and costly it is every freaking year, but people are so cought up on how greedy they are these days and forget the effort they put into supporting the fans. It is actually pretty sad really.. People should be thankful we have blizzard they are among a few of the last good companies out that try and produce quality, costs money to do that time and time again..</div></div><hr />

If you think of it as just going to see a show, sure, it seems expensive. But, if you spin it as a vacation, which some people will make it, it kind of puts a more reasonable light on it. I've spent more to go to Myrtle Beach, and there will be a lot more to keep me busy in Anaheim. :cool:</div></div><hr />

They will announce next expansion this Blizzcon, and it will be released next year. I doubt they would announce it in the next year's Blizzcon or the time between announcement and release would only be a few months. Not to mention that they said content patches and expansions will be released more frequently now, so maybe we don't have to wait until 2012 christmas.</div></div><hr />

25 minutes to sell out? it's true, WOW is dying.<br />

Just because people are in the queue doesnt mean it didnt sell out instantly. Infact it was sold out in about 5 seconds, I had all of my family doing it, and I was the fastest with 230 in queue, my mom was like 2000 and my brother was like 7000, all of us were within 5 seconds.</div></div><hr />

You can put your money on a &quot;Titan Exclusive Reveal Trailer&quot; that will have an amazing CGI video, but only 2-3 four second snippets of actual gameplay footage.<br />

Just because people are in the queue doesnt mean it didnt sell out instantly. Infact it was sold out in about 5 seconds, I had all of my family doing it, and I was the fastest with 230 in queue, my mom was like 2000 and my brother was like 7000, all of us were within 5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Nope, that's pretty bad. Last year it sold out in milliseconds!</div></div><hr />

I doubt they would announce it in the next year's Blizzcon or the time between announcement and release would only be a few months. Not to mention that they said content patches and expansions will be released more frequently now, so maybe we don't have to wait until 2012 christmas.<br />
<br />
i don't think anyone could even possibly fathom how terrible the next expansion will be, i doubt it could be worst then cataclysm, but i guess i wouldn't be surprised if it was, they seemed to have ran out of reasonable Lore bosses, and only one or 2 Final Big Bosses left really, sure you can put a face on the box like with Cataclysm, but without the content up to that point it's absolutely meaningless.</div></div><hr />

And....<br />
The next expansion of WoW. The first Blizzcon after TBC launch introduced WOTLK and the first Blizzcon after WOTLK launch introduced Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

they are going to do to Diablo 3 what they did to Starcraft 2, and completely ruin the franchise, i honestly thing apart from some fancy new graphics and story continuing SC2 was a step backwards honestly, and Diablo 3 won't be any different. and like i said in a above post, any further expansion for WoW will be unfathomable terrible beyond all comprehension, Cataclysm has a couple good things, but they are few and far between, it seems a lot of people are overall unhappy with the expansion, if they release a new expansion next year, it would certainly feel like they are trying to milk the shit out of the game before it dies.</div></div><hr />

I guess if I was completely loaded, maybe I'd consider it, but can all of these people have enough disposable income to spend it on stuff like this? Amazing.<br />
<br />
The people who pays for this is people who want to do something actually fun, and to be perfectly serious, it's cheaper then any 2 hour concert with some half arsed 40 year olds playing their golden oldies.<br />
<br />
Stop thinking this is actually expensive when you get tons of hours worth of entertainment compared to say a concert with a big named band.<br />

You seem to know a lot of things about things you dont actually know anything about.<br />
<br />
And for Starcraft 2 being a step backwards? I beg to differ and so does EVERYONE else I know, Starcraft 2 is an amazing game, to bad you dont think so, but hey thats what opinions are for.</div></div><hr />

While 600K subs may seem a drop in the ocean to some people, one fact remains. WoW subs have dropped below what they were before cataclysm. That means all the people that they gained by launching cataclysm, left in less than 5 months. That from a business pov is a really big fail.<br />
<br />
I also don't think they will be giving details on the next expansion, I honestly don't see enough content being made between now and october.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they make no profit with the &quot;normal&quot; tickets alone but take in addition the 30$ stream tickets, which probably many people gonna buy as well.<br />
<br />
A stream for 2-3 days doesnt cost that much by far, the profit should be pretty good with that one.<br />
<br />
I dont care about the normal ticket prices, thats fine but i could expect from blizzard that they offer free live stream coverage for the folks and its not like Blizzard could not afford that.</div></div><hr />

The event is for people that love the company. The whole company puts a lot of effort into the event and it costs them millions and millions of $$ They usually dont make profit on it, its more for showing off there product and what blizzard is all about, the CEO talks about how expensive and costly it is every freaking year, but people are so cought up on how greedy they are these days and forget the effort they put into supporting the fans. It is actually pretty sad really.. People should be thankful we have blizzard they are among a few of the last good companies out that try and produce quality, costs money to do that time and time again..<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I understand what BlizzCon is all about but there are other conventions and expos which cost far far less and offer just about the same. Mine was just my experience, but I know that E3 for example doesn't cost $175 for 3 days and there you see a lot more of video games as you see on BlizzCon, also let's not forget QuakeCon, which is completely free of any admissions and also offers and insight for any id software game and now even any Bethesda game with press conferences, concerts, swag, playable demos of unreleased games, vendor booths, huge lottery prizes (2x Mustang Shelbys last year) and ofc BYOC tournaments.<br />
<br />
I really don't understand where the $175 price tag for Blizzcon comes from, when everyone is doing it a lot cheaper and offers virtually the same or even a bit more. <br />
<br />
I have nothing against Blizzard, I just don't think the price is justified here and I understand it costs them a lot to make a convention, but as said above others do the same and some even let people in for free, so it can not be so terrible expensive for a company, especially for one of the size of Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

You might want to go to ebay and search for blizzcon 2011. You'll also find that those auctions won't be cancelled. It's happened every year and it will continue to happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
You won't be missing anything if 2011 is anything like 2010 &gt;_&gt;<br />

I've been to two Blizzcon's in a row as well and have to say... I wouldn't recommend it either. They really don't change very much... but having said that... anyone that hasn't been to one before (regardless of whether there are big announcements or not) will have a really awesome time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daburton</div><div class="date">2011-05-22, 05:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is it that people try to compare the $175 bucks for blizzcon to a &quot;2 hour concert&quot;? Where the hell are YOU seeing concerts and who are you seeing? <br />
<br />
Just a quick rundown of some of the concerts from this year and upcoming summer:<br />
<br />
Lords of Acid $10.00<br />
My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult $10.00<br />
Motley Crue with Poison $27.00-$90.00<br />
Goo Goo Dolls with Michelle Branch $27.00 - $63.00<br />
311 with Sumlime and Rome $22.50-$39.50<br />
Journey with Foreigner and Nightranger $25.00-99.50<br />
<br />
For myself, thats nowhere close to the $175.00 you pay for Blizzcon. To each his own I guess. Myself, I would no more attend a Blizzcon since its a single company entity there, as I would attend a Games Workshop Gamesday. I'll wait for Gencon where Blizzard will attend and will end up showing off a lot of the same demos that they are going to show at Blizzcon (I remember in the past previewing BC long before it hit the market, Ghost which was NEVER released to the consoles (but looked cool as hell), Starcraft and some of the Warcraft expansions).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know you probably want it to be an indication of something, but if you do then unfortunately for you it's not. The only reason it took 25 minutes to sell out is because Blizzard initiated a queue on the website to keep it from being slammed so hard that it crashed. I entered the queue about 5-6 seconds after it was online and I started at about position 6700. When the tickets sold out I was at about 2600. I have no idea how many tickets they released, but I'd guess based on those numbers (max of 4 tickets per person) that they put up about 10-12 thousand.<br />
<br />
For some reason people have always wanted Blizzard to fail... I wouldn't recommend that anyone hold their breath.</div></div><hr />

That's what I was thinking, too. I like Blizzard and all, but there's no justification for paying that much unless you're running a magazine or something. Of course, those people probably get press passes.</div></div><hr />

Considering how fast those tickets were sold out the price seems about right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can make about $300 or more easily just by selling the stuff in the goody bag so I don't think it's really that bad of a deal. I sold two complete goody bags last time I went and completely covered the cost of 3 convention tickets and my hotel for the weekend.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sidebar</div><div class="date">2011-05-23, 09:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">took about 5 seconds to sell out.

So yea, if you didn't hit the submit button within 1 second of the page being live, you didn't get tickets.</div></div><hr />
