Blizzcon 2014 - Day 1 Schedule<br />
Nothing has changed from the original day 1 schedule, so there is still a nice sized gap after the Opening Ceremony. <br />

Don't think that this card is actually available ingame; even with this goodie-pack! As far as i see it it seems only to be a sticker!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rhelyo</div><div class="date">2014-11-06, 11:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok so that gap.Is it a surprise planned or they have a 3 hour break after the opening ceremony?<br />
<br />
Edit:clarification about the heartstone card.It is obviously an actual physical item in the goodie bag.The in game goodie for purchasing the virtual ticket or attending the show live is the card back which we received this week.</div></div><hr />

I wonder why there's such a massive gap between the Opening Ceremony and Main WoW / Diablo Panels. I hope it's not a break, because then I need to order more pizza.<br />
<br />
Also, who else thought that little bag with the pin was a condom? I actually had to look twice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is always a headliner panel in the gap to go over their big announcement. I really think we will see something big for the Warcraft universe put in there. Many just focus on WoW, but those of us a little older also realize this is the 20th anniversary for Warcraft I - Orcs &amp; Humans. I would expect something pretty special go in that slot, but they won't let it get out until tomorrow.<br />
<br />
My guess is that we'll see a commemorative video go over the history and also announcements for the updated Warcraft III including TFT xpac, a tease glimpse forward to the next WOW expansion, and also some Hearthstone tid bits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either it'll be closed/open beta being accessible easily OR something such as the &quot;Founder's Pack&quot; we've seen &quot;leaked&quot; a few months ago.<br />
<br />
I would prefer not seeing that &quot;Dota 2&quot; thing all over again. **Cough** Closed Beta lasting for 2 years with 3 millions active players before release **Cough**</div></div><hr />

There isnt a gap, the wow arena tournament is starting at 20.45 hours, and so is the starcraft tournament. (Local Time)</div></div><hr />

<br />
As we can all see, there is a THREE hours GAP after the opening ceremony. How should i explain you, anything related to &quot; Tournaments&quot; Its not part of what we , the audience, are expecting, and also does not justify the 40$ virtual ticket.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The opening part is free on twitch always is. The other 2 parts are just 2hs long for both these will likely be streamed also some place on twitch and other sites for free! Oh and ofc all that info almost word for word will be put here on MMO champ for free. If thats not enough it will be on youtube within hours also for free!</div></div><hr />

It's also often up for free live as well, it's never hard to find, but the ingame stuff is what gets players buying the ticket more than the presentations usually.</div></div><hr />

I don't have the stream, but the opening ceremony and whatnot aren't for 4+ hours at this point. So be patient.</div></div><hr />

Some of us like to, ya know, support the company they've been entertained by for many years. I have disposable income and would much prefer to watch it from the BlizzCon stream.</div></div><hr />

Thats very nice and all but they really don't need your support for their income you know. Why not give &quot;disposable income&quot; to a charity?<br />
But whatever I'll stop there,I know people hate to talk about their own money management</div></div><hr />

Click on the Blizzcon Schedule (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/event-info/schedule/friday) link which takes you to the full Blizzcon (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/event-info/schedule/friday) for today (not the one Chaud has listed) and you see there are three tournaments going on in that time frame (WoW arena, SC2, and Hearthstone). Sometimes it pays to look at the full schedule (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/event-info/schedule/friday) on the actual site and not just the one here. Think I linked the official schedule (http://us.battle.net/blizzcon/en/event-info/schedule/friday) enough times.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard intended something for that seemingly empty block of time, there would have been a block listed even if it was just &quot;SURPRISE EVENT&quot;. There's nothing so there is no planned event. Why would they not list anything there and then have an event? People wouldn't know to head to whatever hall the event is in at that time so most people would miss it. Or they'd cause massive chaos if they called it over the intercom and people would rush to the hall hoping to get in. Yeah ... Blizzard wants people trampled at their own convention and lawsuits along with it.<br />
<br />
From looking at the schedule, beyond the movie and a panel regarding changes to classes, etc, there are no WoW announcements this year. So I wouldn't get excited over that supposed Eye of Azshara. Would seem it's fake. Not a surprise that someone would pull a viscous stunt like that. We saw it last year, too, before Warlords of Draenor came out.<br />
<br />
Logic FTW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I more than support them, i pay my sub fee, i play transfer fee's and for mounts / pets if i like and play the TCG. They get more than enough from me. Not only that but Blizzcon is like a really long advert if you think about it. Why pay to watch them advertise crap to you? It should be free, its good advertisement for them for upcoming games and stuff. <br />
<br />
I agree a ticket to get into blizzcon yeah paid for but a virtual ticket should be free like i said its just a long advert really.</div></div><hr />

I'm guessing this is your first Blizzcon to observe? There has never been that big of an empty hole in the schedule on the Main and Panel stages. That is where this is all coming from. The tournament stage schedules really don't factor into all of this and never have. Try again?</div></div><hr />
