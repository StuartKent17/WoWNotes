Zandalari Trolls and Kul Tiran Allied Races Won't Unlock Until Patch 8.1.5<br />
If you missed the blue posts, PTR builds, and BlizzCon announcement, Blizzard once again reminded players that the two new Allied Races weren't being released today.<br />
I’m curious if I can unlock it today or if I have to wait for the new raid to go to raid finder, anyone know for sure?<br />
At BlizzCon we talked about these Allied Races coming in Patch 8.1.5. It might feel like a new patch day with the season update and raid opening up today, but this is still the continuation of the Tides of Vengeance story. We will have more information on the Zandalari and Kul Tiran soon!</div></div><hr />

Balancing individual traits would be part of balancing. Putting a &quot;50% sale&quot; label on every trait is lazy and basically Blizzard's confession that they cannot and will not put any effort into fixing this feature for PvP (as expected). Expect further nerfs across the board when we get another ring. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

I have no idea when the last trait nerf was but don’t they already balance them and this would just make them less impactful in PvP?</div></div><hr />

So is this ON TOP of them ALREADY being weaker? If so... thatd make a lot of the defensive ones almost worse than just not having them. Like.. am i going to get like a 700 damage shield from Resounding Protection now?</div></div><hr />

&quot;Hey guys, you know the allied race that is either wary of you or doesn't have any legit reason to join your faction at the start of the expansion? Well we're gonna just let you play them from the start because fuck trying to be a little bit consistent with the rest of the allied races on being just that, ALLIED RACES. That term alone would at least hint or indicate that they're not immediately part of the faction and you have to gain their trust and respect for them to want to join up with you, like an ALLY.

To be fair they led people on regardless, they could have given people a hard release date for them instead of trying to keep people subbed and beating around the bush. I am happy I cancelled my subscription until they are actually in. Until then I am playing on a private server since it is free.</div></div><hr />

Kind of like how they said Zandalari would be in at launch during the '17 Blizzcon, opened Presales on the 30th and quietly announced that Zandarali wouldn't be in at launch, but most people probably never saw that and bought BfA thinking they would be.</div></div><hr />

I guess it does indirectly create some alts, but otherwise, it's more like an item drop or akin to that. I feel like it amusingly carries more weight than it should; amusing because this is BfA's content health level we're talking about. It can be a quite nice flavour thing, but it can't carry an expansion or patch.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping they can find a way to make improvements down the line - I feel like there are a lot of systems in the game that needs a lot of work, including combat in general. It's not just the general flow, it can be okay, but wow's engine is coming apart at the seams at times with phasing-related things. I mean, it's an old game so it's in part to be expected but the fact remains.</div></div><hr />

They will never give a hard release date until closer to patch launch because that would be stupid. Fans already take everything said as a promise, so if they gave a date and had to push it back fans would also be ravenously angry. This is typical of them since forever so why are you surprised?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your line of reasoning would make sense if I got access to Kul Tiran Humans after I saved their entire island from not one, not two but three existential threats. Or after I helped probably the most powerful mage in Azeroth actualize her rightful claim to the Lord Admiralty, and assisted her in finding and returning the lost Kul Tiran fleet, basically returning their most prized military resource. If The Kul Tirans joined my ranks at that time, then you would have a point lore wise. But no they will join my ranks after I drag their asses into our war with the Horde. That makes total sense. It’s like “hey thanks for saving us from these evil forces trying to destroy and or seize control of us through evil politics and/or dark magic and uniting our people and returning the pillar of our military might, but you can go fuck yourself. Oh wait you want to use us as cannon fodder in a war you brought to our shores? That is the kind of talk that gets our loyalty.”</div></div><hr />

Actually their exact words were that there would be 6 allied races available at launch with the possibility for more later. There were 6, Zandalari and Kul Tirans just weren't part of those 6.</div></div><hr />

Zandalaris are debatable.<br />

But, correct me if I'm wrong, the assault on Dazar'alor is made BY the Kul'tirans, so that's a kind of sign they're already allied with the Alliance right ?</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon 2016<br />

I’m well aware, but the game was still in development and things change - as is the case with several other things before. When I say “original” plan, what I mean is the plan they had set for this expansion once development was complete. That included replacing Zandalari with Mag’har and putting them out in 8.1.5. That’s been the plan since the expansion was finished, and that’s the plan they’re sticking too. We’ve known they wouldn’t be out with release since beta, and we’ve known they’ll be coming with 8.1.5, so it’s nothing new and it’s nothing that’s been delayed - they’re literally sticking to their plan.</div></div><hr />

Because people are just that dumb. Same thing happened in Legion when people complained about how lazy the art team was with the Tomb of Sargeras tier gear when Ion said at Blizzcon that the gear would be a throw-back to Tier 6.<br />
<br />
Well, dumb and the fact they're addicted to bitching.</div></div><hr />

They will never give a hard release date until closer to patch launch because that would be stupid. Fans already take everything said as a promise, so if they gave a date and had to push it back fans would also be ravenously angry. This is typical of them since forever so why are you surprised?<br />

Or after I helped probably the most powerful mage in Azeroth actualize her rightful claim to the Lord Admiralty, and assisted her in finding and returning the lost Kul Tiran fleet, basically returning their most prized military resource. If The Kul Tirans joined my ranks at that time, then you would have a point lore wise. But no they will join my ranks after I drag their asses into our war with the Horde. That makes total sense. It’s like “hey thanks for saving us from these evil forces trying to destroy and or seize control of us through evil politics and/or dark magic and uniting our people and returning the pillar of our military might, but you can go fuck yourself. Oh wait you want to use us as cannon fodder in a war you brought to our shores? That is the kind of talk that gets our loyalty.”<br />

Zandalaris are debatable.<br />
<br />
But, correct me if I'm wrong, the assault on Dazar'alor is made BY the Kul'tirans, so that's a kind of sign they're already allied with the Alliance right ?<br />
<br />
They can still be reserved in joining the faction but still have a desire to help attack a group of monsters that killed their beloved Kul'tirans those many years ago. Think of it as WWI and they're still in the pre-war stage leading up to the Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand of Austria in Sarajevo. Well now Russia and Serbia fucked up by killing Rastakhan and they're going to have to fight. No matter what, even if the Horde and Alliance mysteriously backed out and completely left the isles, the Zandalari will stop at nothing to kill every last Kul'tiran to avenge their dead king.</div></div><hr />

Well we're gonna just let you play them from the start because fuck trying to be a little bit consistent with the rest of the allied races on being just that, ALLIED RACES. That term alone would at least hint or indicate that they're not immediately part of the faction and you have to gain their trust and respect for them to want to join up with you, like an ALLY. Since there's no serious reason until AFTER an entire siege of one of the allied races' capital with the help of the OTHER allied race, we'll just say screw the rules and let you do it from the start.&quot;<br />
<br />
Imagine giving a lore reason to gate content in 2k19 WoW.<br />

Remember when you could play new races at a start of an expansion? Mhhhh, the good old times. But then came Activision and she said: &quot;time gating there shall be!&quot; And time gating there was.</div></div><hr />

In some respects, yes. But literally every game ever has had things get pushed back, cut, and what have you. Sure Zandalari got pushed back to the next patch, but instead we got Mag'har to fill the gap. It sucks sure, but that how game development is sometimes and you have to accept that, either that or be prepared for them to stop communication all together if the fanbase begins to have unrealistic expectations (which they often do).</div></div><hr />

Imagine at one point in your life that you were able to comprehend and understand the difference between a NEW RACE and an ALLIED RACE. Allied being that you bring in a variant of a currently existing race into the fold but that's after doing their attunement. You know attunements right? That one thing that all the Classic fans love to froth with joy over? <br />
<br />
Instead you're getting your rep up with a race and gaining their help. Now, if these were featured as new races altogether (say Draenai and Blood Elves were being released instead) and they weren't immediately available I would understand and share your frustration. But they're not. They're trolls and humans. Variants of trolls and humans. Variants of trolls and humans that you, as a main faction race character, go to their land and start shit up on and bring them into the fold so they eventually have no choice BUT to join your group. <br />
<br />
Oh and before you try to argue &quot;But the Panderan were able to join at the start and yet we went to their land and started war&quot; I will inform you on the timeline of events since I don't think you're capable of deciphering it yourself.<br />
<br />
&quot; Shortly after the Cataclysm ravaged Azeroth, the protective mists surrounding Pandaria dissipated, and before long, Alliance and Horde warships arrived on the continent, causing the native pandaren to become involved in the conflict between the two factions. Around roughly the same time, an Alliance gunship carrying Horde prisoners crashed into the side of the Wandering Isle, and shortly thereafter pandaren followers of the Tushui and Huojin disciplines decided to leave their home to swear allegiance to the Alliance king and Horde Warchief, respectively. &quot;<br />

Sure that is totaly the reason.<br />

Allied race is just a made up word by blizzard so they can force feed us rep grinds and time gated boring shit.<br />

I know what you are saying but most people you ask we're under the impression we were getting them a lot sooner. For people like me and my wife we were planning the expansion around them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would we want you to play Zandalari, one of the most anticpated races at launch, when we can wait until after the 2nd raid, and when you;re not only invested gear wise, but also time wise due to the shitty necklace design?<br />
<br />
That way, you pay for a Race Change rather than re-grind!<br />

I’m well aware, but the game was still in development and things change - as is the case with several other things before. When I say “original” plan, what I mean is I'm going to move the goal posts so I'm technically not wrong. Phew, that was a close one.<br />
<br />
Mmmokay then. Sure.</div></div><hr />

I argue that it isn't if EVERYTHING goes down by the same percent, the imbalances from one item will be kept equal to this other item, the it is the same relatively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and one thing is super clear..<br />
<br />
this system dont survive to 9.0!<br />
<br />
maybe this is the return of the t-set system? i hope</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Protnshock</div><div class="date">2019-01-26, 11:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been 2800/Multi-glad myself and honestly I am glad they're just basically getting rid of the traits in PvP.<br />
<br />
Competitive PvP should have absolutely nothing to do with gear. It shouldn't be about 'who's the the bigger stick' or 'who's stick is sharper' or whatever analogy you wanna spin on this. The best player(s) should be the ones who win. Not the most lucky who happened to high roll a piece or happened to get best in slot items and traits that make them stupidly overpowered.<br />
<br />
I get what Blizzard was trying to do to help make classes feel more 'whole' with the Azerite traits to replace the Artifact Weapons from Legion. But the fact of the matter is? Everyone had access to the same picking options for traits in Legion. The only difference was Artifact Power. And after a certain point it didn't make a difference weather you were at 10 concordance in Legion arena or if you were at 30 since it was scaled in arena.<br />
<br />
Where-as with the current system it's all RNG / highrolling / lowrolling.<br />
<br />
I am not defending Blizzard, I think the game is currently BEYOND dreadful but I think this is a decent step in the right direction. Though it is moderately concerning that it seems like Blizzard is essentially just 'flipping the board' and saying &quot;I give up&quot; and tossing this lazy solution onto the PvP community. I can only hope that they try to do better in the future.</div></div><hr />
