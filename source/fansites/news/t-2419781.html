PremadeAutoAccept Addon<br />
The Group Finder has seen a number of changes over the past year, first requiring manual clicks to list or search (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6579-Group-Finder-Addons-Changed-Blue-Posts), then not allowing addons to create groups (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7718-Battle-for-Azeroth-World-Quest-UI-Changes-Tweets-FinalBossTV-Paladins-DLC-637), and finally making searching / naming groups / accepting group members manual yesterday (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7843-Group-Finder-Addon-Changes-Zappi-Boi-August-8-Hotfixes-Warcraft-Secrets).<br />
<br />
Kruithne has created an addon that restores Auto Accepting individual group applicants, as well as allowing you to only auto accept based on roles.<br />
<br />

Battle for Azeroth Preview - Stormsong Valley Visitor’s Guide<br />
Located in the northernmost region of Kul Tiras, Stormsong Valley is home to House Stormsong and the mystical tidesages. Wielding great power over the seas, the tidesages impart their blessings upon the mighty Kul Tiran fleet. Join us as we take you on a brief tour of Stormsong Valley.<br />
<br />
The lands of Stormsong Valley are lush with green grasses and rock-strewn rolling hills. Wildlife and plant growth thrive here, fed by the inland streams and the invigorating sea air. It is a region made rich by the harmony between both land and sea.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Welcome to Stormsong Valley.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/zrULtHb8ooo?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay; encrypted-media&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
As with any great mystery, you’ll need to find and follow the clues before you. Begin by taking a ferry to the Stormsong Monastery located in Boralus. Perhaps the sisters and brothers there will have more insight on the missing fleet. Thankfully, you won’t be alone for your journey. A ward of Harbormaster Cyrus Crestfall, your guide Taelia is a knowledgeable companion eager to help you get to the bottom of things in Stormsong Valley.<br />
<br />
The signs of the sea are everywhere in the monastery, but an itch between your shoulder blades feeds the impression that you’re unwelcome. Answers aren’t easy to come by and danger is lurking nearer than you think.<br />
<br />
Word from someone within the resistance is that the fleet is not truly lost but trapped by dark forces. It will be up to you to find allies within Stormsong Valley to help you root out the heart of this conspiracy and bring the fleet home. Brother Pike from the town of Brennadam in the north is one such ally. You’ll need to meet with him to find out what more he knows of the challenges you’ll face.<br />
<br />
The Highland Pass is the only land route into Stormsong Valley, but a blockade halts passage between Brennadam and the rest of Kul Tiras. Once you find a way through, you’ll crest the pass to take in the breathtaking sight of the land stretched out before you.<br />
<br />
Meet the Neighbors<br />
The reception you’ll receive in Brennadam isn’t a warm one despite the beauty of the surrounding town. The citizens are angry at the soldiers for seizing their harvests and failing to protect the people they are meant to serve. Brother Pike will help find the answers you seek, but each discovery is another knot in a skein that wends through this troubled land. There is more beneath the surface to be discovered, and you sense darkness waiting just out of sight.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/thumb/SSV01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2018/august/SSV01.jpg) <br />
<br />
The further inland you go, the more apparent it becomes that the void’s corruption has burrowed deeply into the land, the wildlife, and its people. Those of able body (if not able mind) are either conscripted or manipulated into serving the tidesages and the malevolent will that commands them.<br />
<br />
Things to Try: A sip of Seaglide Elixir can be a great refreshment when battling void-corrupted creatures of the sea. It also gives you the ability to walk on water—for a little while. “It is said that tidesage magic allows Kul Tiran ships to glide effortlessly through the sea.” Try not to touch too many unfamiliar things unless you know what you’re getting into—though of course, the voices will insist there's nothing to fear. The Whispering Wavestaff giveth and taketh. But then again, what’s a little cost in health compared to laying out a little extra carnage?<br />
<br />
Under the Siege<br />
On the western coast, Fort Daelin is under siege by the naga. Brutes pummel the stone walls even as harpoons drive further into the walls above them. Without aid, the levee holding back the sea will plunge the fertile valley into the naga-infested depths.<br />
<br />
A Prickly Situation<br />
Emboldened by the soldiers neglecting their duties, vicious creatures have encroached on the noble people of Stormsong. Whether it’s ettin in Millstone Hamlet or the territorial quilboar, these threats will only grow more aggressive without someone to push them back.<br />
<br />
Monsters of the Sea<br />
On an island to the northeast resides the seat of power for both House Stormsong and the tidesages: the Shrine of the Storm. Its very foundations are carved into the rocky outcroppings, and the sign of the kraken adorns its ancient structures.<br />
<br />
Shrine of the Storm Dungeon--Spoilers Inside! <br />
The Shrine of the Storm is a seat of power for both House Stormsong and the tidesages. Here, blessings upon the fleet are performed to ensure that the Kul Tiran fleet knows no equals in combat. Yet, a dark force has corrupted these sacred grounds and threatens to steal control of the Kul Tiran Fleet forever.<br />
<br />
Difficulties: Normal, Heroic, Mythic<br />
Level: Alliance* 110+ (One of four level-up dungeons)<br />
<br />
*Available at level 120 for Alliance and Horde<br />
<br />
Aqu’sirr – The deeps hide many powerful secrets lost to time. A master of these waters, Lord Stormsong calls upon one of these creatures of myth to defend the sacred shrine.<br />
<br />
Tidesage Council – Brother Ironhull and Galecaller Faye use their power to bless the Kul Tiran ships and ensure their fleet remains unmatched on the seas.<br />
<br />
Lord Stormsong – Master of House Stormsong, Lord Stormsong leads the tidesages in tehri oceanic blessigns and ways. However, not all is as it seems. . . .<br />
<br />
Vol’zith the Whisperer – Sent by Queen Azshara to subvert the tidesages, Vol’zith whispers promises of power to those willing to listen.<br />
<br />
There’s a long road to take through this beautiful but treacherous land. Bringing House Stormsong back into the fold and freeing the Kul Tiran fleet are paramount to defending the kingdom against the Horde's incursion. Those brave enough to explore Stormsong Valley's vast coastlines will meet a brave, noble people who embrace the land they live in and the bountiful sea they so love.<br />
<br />
When you’re ready to go beyond the lands of Stormsong Valley, the stygian hills of Drustvar await to the southwest, and to the southeast lies the capital of Kul Tiras, Tiragarde Sound.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, I DO wonder exactly what Blizz will do... I didn't fret the changes up until they blocked paste for the group name and eliminated the auto accept entirely. Yes, I DO know that it can be a tad annoying to see members come in and out (obviously realm hoppers) but this solution is FAR WORSE than the annoyance.</div></div><hr />

That's my guess too but I haven't really used much of these group finder addons anyway so personally I couldn't care less.<br />
<br />
But seeing people's reactions to the latest changes, I imagine Blizzard would do something about this addon too. No idea of the details, just a guess. :P</div></div><hr />

No they aren't.<br />
<br />
They counter them since years, it's the risk when you open your game to addons. There's no circumvention of anything, they are legitimate addons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
If you want to break everyone's addon that they use to form guild raids, this is a pretty solid way of going about getting Blizzard to do that. You can already do auto-invites from the group finder if people just read the description and you use already existing addons. Guess those will get broken too now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For one, auto accept was something Blizzard put in the game themselves so they're free to do what they want with it without giving anyone a 'rap across the knuckles'. For two, that they did remove/disable it in the UI means that they probably had a good reason for doing so. And no, despite what complainers want to say, 'nerfing fun' is not and has never been a reason for them doing anything.</div></div><hr />

lol. You are everything wrong with the community.<br />
<br />
Even though I agree that saying shit like that is of course a bit childish, but at this point it seems a lot of players want a option to quickly find groups for world quests and such, why put so much effort in taking away what we use for that?<br />
<br />
I just hope blizzard is just killing the lfg addons because they gonna release something like the addon themself for finding groups.<br />
<br />
If not, well that would be annoying. <br />
It won't be a big deal but it sure made doing world quests a lot smoother. <br />
I know some people afked them, but I didn't see that happen that much and of it did annoy me, I would make a group myself and it would fil within 10 seconds and I could just kick afkers.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, whenever blizzard breaks addons on purpose, trying to counter it is always the WORST thing you can do, cause they end up gutting the API even harder and hurting other addons.<br />
<br />
We lost custom friendly nameplates in raid cause people went out of their way to bring radars/lines back when blizzard had already made their stance clear on it., as just one example. When blizzard makes bad decisions get to forums and complain, but doing things like this is just going to hurt more users.<br />
<br />
One thing I've learned over years as addon developer, do not arms race blizzard. If they break something, EVEN IF YOU FIND A WORK AROUND, just don't. Use the work around internally with guildies and friends via a WA or something. You throw that work around in blizzards face and all you will get in return is &quot;oh you think so huh? have a big fat plate of FU&quot; back from blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Since my subscription never runs out for more than 2 days there is no reason to slow down content to increase my subscription time.<br />
There are always dungeons to do, professions to perfect, achievements without world quests to do and raids to prepare for.<br />
There are friends and guildmates that would help you rush through boring parts and focus on something else.<br />
Maybe leveling an alt of an allied race instead if all you have left to do is wait for the next weekly raid reset ;)<br />
I won't let anyone make my decisions for me about what i should do or not. So we can calmly discuss the fact and shake our heads and ask for explanations but the tone is far too hostile around the recent discussions to come to a reasonable solution. Insults do not lead anywhere.</div></div><hr />

How about doing load and performance test prior to introducing features? If you're not sure your infrastructure can handle it, don't let it go live... Blizz is a billion $ company, so i expect at least simple QA-standards...<br />
<br />
Disabling something because your infrastructure isn't capable of handling, and that without proper communication, just sucks.</div></div><hr />

What about doing load and performance tests in the first instance? If your infrastructure isn't capable of handling a change, it shouldn't go live at all. <br />
But reverting some self introduced functionality coz of performance issues much much later without any notice just sucks. (and i won't say anything about what that tells about your QA department here)</div></div><hr />

Nah, thats not how it works at all, they make a product/service, and you are the consumer that buys said product/service. If you buy a car from Toyota, it doesn't suddenly give you a say in how Toyota conducts their business or makes their cars.<br />
<br />
Your real power as a consumer is to vote with your wallet, if they make decisions you don't agree with, stop paying them. Stop playing the game. Going on the internet and whinging about it then continuing to pay them really achieves nothing at all, if everyone who didn't like what they were doing cancelled their subs and hit their bottom line then they'll sit up and take notice. <br />
<br />
More likely though, it wouldn't make a difference because its a storm in a tea cup and most people either don't care enough, or just go on mmo champion to complain in the comments but keep paying for a sub anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Toyota continually does focus groups and market research to determine what their customers want. Consumers drive demand. They ask how to make their cars and to some extent, conduct their business. So yeah, it is kinda how it works - they just do it proactively, instead of, well, not at all. I mean, I don't know if Blizzard does that with WoW; I would somehow doubt it given how much absofucking retarded shit they pump out. But who knows.<br />
<br />
Complaining about a product isn't useless and shouldn't be seen as useless. Complaints are how products improve. I don't know how that very simple fact escapes so many people, but it does, I guess. <br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't seem to really innovate anymore. I think they lost that spark of creativity a loooongass time ago. They're very excellent at creating products that are improvements. They're excellent at control. HOTS, Hearthstone, Overwatch...they're all cleaned-up, controlled, polished ripoffs of other people's work. Even with WoW, it seems like the majority of improvements to their UI have been assimilated from addons authored/created first by non-Blizzard employees. I think that's why we haven't seen a new Diablo in a while, TBH - Blizz doesn't have many products to look at and steal from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, sorry, I just realized I accidentally quoted you. My mistake. Tl;DR though is that this article previously contained a promotion for a world quest grouping addon that was later removed without any word why. At first glance it looks like censorship (Maybe Blizzard &quot;politely&quot; asked them to take it down) and if so it sets a bad precedent for things posted here and what say Blizzard has in the content. (That said I could be completely wrong and there's another reason)<br />
