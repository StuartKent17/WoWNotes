Battle.Net - Facebook Streaming<br />
Tonight's Battle.Net Alpha update added the code to allow for users to stream to Facebook (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5747-Blizzard-Adding-Facebook-Login-and-Facebook-Live-Streaming).<br />
<br />
We tested the quality with Hearthstone, but you can stream any of the games in the launcher. The quality isn't great, but keep in mind that this feature is not actually released or even active yet.<br />

AskMrRobot - Legion Simulator<br />
AskMrRobot has released a simulator to model Legion bosses and gameplay. You can read all of the details in their intro post (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/2016/06/new-legion-simulator/) and help page (http://blog.askmrrobot.com/simulator-help/).<br />
<br />
<br />
Lots of the details of simulation are contained on a wiki for everyone to see and edit. <br />
This includes how spells work, how buffs interact, and the assumptions made in spell rotations.<br />
The simulator will model every boss in Legion with multiple scenarios. <br />
Simulation setups can be shared and modified. <br />
Currently every DPS spec is implemented with basic rotations, most Legion gear is added, and web based simulations are available. <br />
In the future a client is coming so that more intensive simulations can be run locally, batch simulations, distributed simulations, stat weight generation, and more. <br />
<br />

Warcraft Movie - China Box Office Update<br />
The Warcraft Movie earned $0.95M in China on Friday, bringing the total to $215.5M.<br />

Raid Testing Schedule - June 24-27<br />
Within a few hours, we will be opening the first Raid Finder wing of the Emerald Nightmare. We'll leave it open over the weekend.<br />
<br />
On Monday, June 27, we will continue our Legion Mythic raid testing.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires 20 and does not scale.<br />
<br />
Monday, June 27<br />
<br />
Chronomatic Anomaly - Mythic Nighthold<br />
13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
Trilliax - Mythic Nighthold<br />
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 00:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
<br />
FEEDBACK: Darkbough (Raid Finder)<br />
The first week of the Emerald Nightmare raid is now open in Raid Finder, containing Nythendra, Il'gynoth, and Elerethe Renferal. Players level 100+ may queue, and players' level and item level will be scaled accordingly.<br />
<br />
Please use this thread for any feedback on mechanics, clarity, tuning, bugs, etc.<br />

Cudgel of the Warmaster. The lfr appearance shows up in my appearance tab as not collected.

Horn of Valor Nerf<br />
Is it as intended for regular heroic horn of valor to have the same agility on use effect as a titanforged mythic horn? I have a titanforged and it feels so underwhelming to have the same agility on use as a heroic version.<br />

Fire Mage -- Legion Beta Feedback<br />
There may still have to be some tuning on Phoenix Flames, once we see how the auto-crit fits into the rotation. Overall it's an effect we like, and part of the reason is that it helps stop Combustion from being the only correct time to use PF. But the 90sec recharge is too long--that will be reduced next build.

Enhancement Shaman Feedback -- Legion Beta Feedback<br />
To clarify a few things:<br />
--This build caught the middle of a few changes. Next build, Maelstrom Weapon will affect autoattacks and Windfury attacks. That should keep Windfury relevant to the rotation, but still leave Maelstrom generation lower than before (which we found to be too high). In addition, there is no longer the confusing and unnecessary fact that Stormstrike and Lava Lash both spent and generated Maelstrom.<br />
--There's no intended change to Feral Spirits; that's a tooltip bug.<br />
--The rotation with Boulderfist is meant to be Maelstrom-limited (i.e., it should have open GCD's, unlike the usual rotation). After Maelstrom Weapon is working properly, we'll see if the Boulderfist rotation is correct as far as pacing, and can tune the damage from there.

It just didn't have legs as they say. I'd be surprised if it's on the schedule in next week's theaters at least in the US. Sadly the odds for a WC2 movie are dwindling. The retail blu-ray/digital sales will need to be pretty huge I think to come close to their break-even target of $500M. But supposedly a good 30% was cut from the theater version, so maybe fans eager for a full director's cut including cut and behind the scenes content will boost it. It would seem unlikely to boost the net revenue that much though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
facebook paid for this, its not a blizzard initiative. This is just Blizzard accepting a cash infusion. If blizzard gave half a ^#$% about the gaming community, they would have added a useful feature.(aka. twitch)<br />
<br />
Their goal is to be able to put an ad on facebook so that new players can start playing by just clicking a link and not even needing a battle.net account anymore. Login's can be handled via facebook API. The day battle.net goes away and &quot;log in with facebook&quot; becomes the only way to play, will be the last day I play a blizzard game. Or worse yet, facebook will do what they do best.... buy blizzard/activision for a few billion dollars. That will be the real wow killer. Facebook. I. hate. facebook.<br />

I will definitely buy it. I enjoyed the movie and didn't look for any of the easter eggs, I just watched it as I would any other movie. I would like to see a director's cut to see the 40 minutes. I also came away with a theory that was hinted in the movie that I have not seen mentioned anywhere else. I don't know if it was overlooked or just didn't register with people. At any rate, director's cut or not, I will buy the DVD. And I hope there is a sequel. I came out of the movie alongside a mother and her teenage son and they were saying they wondered what movie the critics saw because they loved the movie and wanted to see a sequel. I asked and neither of them play WOW. I asked if they had problems following the story and they said no.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I liked the movie too... I gave it a 7/10.. My main problem, was that it was rushed. Especially in the beginning. Im watching it and im like really? 1 or less minute on one scene, then skip to another which takes place later. and so on.. the pacing was bad too. Thats why I really wanted the 40+ minutes.. I mean, As a lore buff, Even the lore changes didnt bother me that much.. It was all the pacing... I even liked Garona, and alot didnt like her performance.</div></div><hr />

Are you serious? The US numbers don't even compare with the Chinese numbers. Warcraft won big in China, that's why it's still being reported on.</div></div><hr />
