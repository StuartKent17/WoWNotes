The following Arena Season will not begin for at least one week after the current season ends. During this time between seasons, all rated matches will be turned off and only skirmishes will be available. When Arena Season 7 begins, all team ratings, personal rating, and arena points will be wiped, but matchmaking rating and honor points will remain. <br />

Race and Faction Changes ETA<br />
Cataclysm was just announced so it will be awhile before we have systems fully decided upon for it, especially since the paid faction change service isn't even out yet. That said I wouldn't be surprised if there were some restrictions to avoid people making level 80s of the new races on day 1, nothing is set in stone though so we will have to wait and see.

<br />
Reforging<br />
Imagine reforging could work like enchanting, where there are specific recipes that everyone knows. Example: &quot;Converts Spirit into 50% equivalent hit rating on gloves.&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it would work like this, but something along those lines would be pretty comparable to existing features. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/19377974606-reforging-may-be-extremely-confusing.html))<br />
<br />
Titan's Path<br />
Philosophically, it works like this. Leveling up is fun. You get new gear constantly, and every time you ding, you get new stats, new ranks of spells and possibly new spells. You improve every single hour you play, if not more frequently.<br />
<br />
When you hit max level, this really slows down. If you raid or PvP you might get a new item once a week if you're lucky, and aside from gear, rewards are very infrequent.<br />
<br />
The idea behind the paths is to offer max-level character progression over time that isn't tied to gear.<br />
<br />
The feature is much more robust than this, but at a very conceptual level imagine that at level 85 you got a new talent point every week just for logging in. The rewards are slower than during the leveling period, but they are rewards that exist independent of gear. However on the other hand, you don't feel the need to race through them (in fact you can't) if you are focused on getting to max level and they don't bloat your spellbook with as many abilities as gaining actual whole levels (though they will add a few). Over time, the actual discussions about how to build a character will likely change and evolve in interesting ways. The new point might give you a reason to log in on non-raid nights or even if you've gotten a little burned out on raiding.<br />
<br />
The mantra is &quot;gated, not grindy.&quot; They will require you to do something, but they are also designed with the idea that you can't kill yourself trying to blast through them as fast as possible.

Why not one slide per class at Blizzcon?<br />
For last year's Blizzcon we did a slide per class, but that meant the amount of detail we could offer was almost trivial (and particularly annoying for hybrids). There is no way to offer as much detail as players are looking for unless we have the DK panel, etc.<br />
<br />
[...] I'm not sure the 10 minute summary of 10 classes would have worked well. Last year for instance we had one slide on priests and only really covered Mind Sear, so all of the healing priests were like &quot;What about us?&quot;<br />
<br />
The class panel has always been popular, so they started offering it twice even before I got to Blizzard. There are probably other ways to do it though. Maybe you make the class panel really long the first time and make the second one just about Q&amp;A. You have to think that we're going to have even more information to cover (and questions to answer) once Diablo and SC have shipped so maybe it will be even harder to justify doing a class panel twice.<br />
<br />
If we hadn't covered items, then we could have done more classes. But the item changes were just as important. We could have put items with dungeons or systems, but those were busy too. Basically, we had a ton of info to share and only 2 days. :)<br />
<br />
Handling questions asked on the floor is just as tricky as handling those asked on the forums. They may not be important to you, but they could be very important to the gal or guy asking the question. It doesn't seem fair to tell some people their issues aren't worthy before they even get to ask.<br />
<br />
I don't have any great answers for how to handle it, but as with everything we do, we'll keep striving to improve it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/19382693589-blizzcon-dk.html))<br />
<br />
Reasons behind the item stats changes in Cataclysm<br />
I find many of these arguments to be elitist. This is not a &quot;catering to the casuals&quot; issue. This is an issue that even some of our most educated and math-savy players could not make gear decisions without the help of external tools. We're much less concerned about more casual players because the specific choice of upgrade will mean less for them (skill outweighs the contribution of stats for all but the absolute best players) and they often choose pieces based on things like art over stats.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about very hardcore raiders who no longer could eyeball a piece of gear with any degree of authority. I might believe that some very few of you are so proficient with the math as to be able to eyeball the stats, but I think you are vastly overestimating the number of players who can or do. Remember, the formula to convert armor penetration into damage was so complicated that we had to take the unusual step of actually spelling out how it was calculated.<br />
<br />
With this change will you still have to make hard choices about upgrading? Absolutely. Will there still be quasi-religious debates about which neck is best in slot for a given spec? Of course. Will you still need to understand the mechanics to make the best choice for your character? We think so. One of our overall design philosophies for WoW (and Blizzard) is to be simple but have a lot of depth. Some people mistake needless complexity for depth.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, we think there is a lot of benefit of getting rid of problematic stats like defense and accomplishing things like letting casters improve by focusing on throughput over mana pool.

<br />
I wish they'd detail a little more how making all tanks crit immune from talents, and how removing block rating, isn't going to homogenise the tanking classes even more. Everybody's auto crit immune, and block will block the same amount regardless of gear? They have to have better plans than that :\</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like they did it with druid tanks..just call the talent something fitting for the class.<br />
And regarding block, they don't take it out iirc. They change it to a %-avoid stat so it's finally useful. No homogenization. Warrior+Paladin = Block, Druid+DK = no Block. Think of mastery I bet Paladins have a +x% chance to block mastery. Block will keep being dependend on gear. Defense not. Annoying, every tank has to be crit immune. Period. Defense over the cap is often wasted. So it just takes the &quot;juggling around the cap&quot; away so tanks can concentrate on migitation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Excellent, IMHO. I doubt many of us have seen it as a &quot;dumbing down&quot; at all. One of WotLK's main issues, for me, is a surplus of hit, and the near-inability to get as close to the cap as possible. You're either below it or above it (by some margin). My warlock has had about 19% hit before, when I believe all I need is 17%. Reforging, IMHO, is a great idea. <br />

Titan's Path<br />
The idea behind the paths is to offer max-level character progression over time that isn't tied to gear.<br />
<br />
The feature is much more robust than this, but at a very conceptual level imagine that at level 85 you got a new talent point every week just for logging in. The rewards are slower than during the leveling period, but they are rewards that exist independent of gear. However on the other hand, you don't feel the need to race through them (in fact you can't) if you are focused on getting to max level and they don't bloat your spellbook with as many abilities as gaining actual whole levels (though they will add a few). Over time, the actual discussions about how to build a character will likely change and evolve in interesting ways. The new point might give you a reason to log in on non-raid nights or even if you've gotten a little burned out on raiding.<br />
<br />
Eh, i dont quite get this.. you keep getting talant points &quot;over time&quot; when you hitt level 85..<br />

<br />
He didn't mean talent points literally. Think of it as another system of character progression beyond gear and talents once you hit 85 that just keeps going as time continues. To be honest this is something WoW needed in BC, once you reach end game there has to be multiple forms of hard character progression outside of gear.</div></div><hr />

I for one welcome this change so that those 3-5 points I'm usually sitting above the expertise cap won't go to waste. It would be absolutely awesome if it were to apply to gems like agi/hit or exp/hit as well but I'm not getting my hopes up for that one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok. Actually, I don't spend enough time or effort in the game to consider myself a hardcore player. I am nothing more than a casual, since I play few hours a day, preferring doing bgs with my gf and our irl friends, leveling an alt, skilling up my professions, doing a couple heroics, instead of hardcore raiding/arena. But hell, I've never chosen a piece of gear &quot;based on things like art over stats&quot;. I love to upgrade my gear and enhance my character, and I know (well) how to do it and what stats are the best for my class/spec. I'm not a brainless, and neither all &quot;casuals&quot; I know are so.<br />
I know it's hard to realize, but being a &quot;casual&quot; is not the same as being a retard.</div></div><hr />

Reforging and stat simplification are welcomed by me. IMO, there was far too much balancing that needed to be done by players when a new piece dropped.

I wish they'd detail a little more how making all tanks crit immune from talents, and how removing block rating, isn't going to homogenise the tanking classes even more. Everybody's auto crit immune, and block will block the same amount regardless of gear? They have to have better plans than that :\<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree... It's not going to be fun at all if we're all the same. Right now they do a crap job with the Gear, making us choose between 2 somewhat good stats, crit or haste, spirit or Mp5. I wonder what kind of variations could be in the gear now, more than half the things we calculate are gone, and we all stack on the same thing now. Gearing up they said is going to mostly be for looks now, but nothing will stop idiots from all going the same spec... like rogue PvP its 41-5-20 and nothing else, all PvP do that.<br />

I hope they prevent these Crit immune Tanks from wearing Holy Gear again.</div></div><hr />

If you have a basic understanding of how the stats work, you can make a pretty informed judgement based on item level. For example, it's usually not a decision between Armor Pen or Attack Power. Ive noticed, the decision is usually between Armor Pen, Haste, Expertise or Hit. I usually don't go for Expertise for PvE. My top priority first, is usually Hit. If im at Hit soft cap, im going for Haste or Armor Pen, And if it's equal item level, i go for Armor Pen over haste (This is on my rogue), if the Armor pen gear is lower item level though, i go for Haste. Occasionally its a decision between Armor Pen or Crit. Im really undecided on these, both are very useful for my class. Blizz usually has a pretty good system of scaling the stats on their own based on item level, all you have to figure out is which stat helps you more when you get different stats within the same item level bracket.</div></div><hr />

heres the issue...at least in my guilds that i have been in.<br />
<br />
1. you raid 3-4 hours a night 3-4 nights a week. for some people thats enough wow &lt;not i tho ; ) &gt;<br />
<br />
2. most guilds i have been in dont want A. more then one alt or B. any non lv capped toons. i like a lot of people have more then even 2 toons we like to play and so if were on them you think were not playing at all BECUASE of 3.<br />
<br />
3. i dont want my guild knowing all my alts cus sometimes i just want to chill in a city/ pvp / lv again / farm mats for when i do raid. if im playing wow it doesnt always mean that i want to hang with the guild. i dont get on my main at all anymore except raid nights becuse, as a healer, guild spams worse then general spam. a stranger expects you to say no where guild can &lt;and mine does&gt; demand you come to the heroics or old raid even though its off night. <br />

<br />
<br />
ROFL good one...and not too far off-base. As a prot pally, I had to decide whether or not to take a piece of obvious tank gear even if it had no defense on it. Would it drop me below uncrittable? If so, would I have to swap out other pieces of gear just to keep me at or above 540 at the cost of losing more stam/hit/avoidance? It would be just a constant juggling act and I always have around ~15 pieces of misc. tank gear for different sets or just to make up for a loss of a certain stat. Trying to be capped for defense (which really isn't a &quot;cap&quot; like the others), hit, expertise, etc all at the same time is just a &quot;/head explodes&quot; waiting to happen. You get into the problem also where you spend too much time theorycrafting and juggling around your gear that you're not actually enjoying the game and having fun. I understand that theorycrafting and being all &quot;mathy&quot; is fun for a lot of players but you truly are in the minority. Personally, I don't like holding up my guild's progression because I can't decide whether or not to /roll on a piece of gear that may or may not be an upgrade for me, at which point I have to alt+tab out and check Rawr or Wowhead comparison. I understand my class and tanking mechanics well enough, but many times the upgrades aren't quite so obvious. And RatingBuster isn't always 100% accurate, either. It doesn't always factor in enchants either, if I remember correctly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are dreaming. Spell power is not being converted into Int.<br />
In Cataclysm Misery's End's stats would be 66 Stam, 66 Int, 44 Crit and 66 Haste. Spell power is simply going to 'disappear' - what will happen instead is a conversion, where Blizzard will say &quot;ok, at the first raid tier we expect This Caster/All Casters to have X intellect, and we want them to have Y spell power, so the spell power gain from equipping Misery's End is 66*X/Y, and that formula will be the same for all items&quot;<br />
<br />
A good question to ask is what, precisely, they're going to do with the item points that gear currently spends on spell power, as tunneling them into intellect will just frankly break the game thanks to caster weapons spending the lion's share of their points on spell power.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LeperHerring</div><div class="date">2009-08-26, 06:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reasons behind the item stats changes in Cataclysm<br />
I find many of these arguments to be elitist. This is not a &quot;catering to the casuals&quot; issue. This is an issue that even some of our most educated and math-savy players could not make gear decisions without the help of external tools. We're much less concerned about more casual players because the specific choice of upgrade will mean less for them (skill outweighs the contribution of stats for all but the absolute best players) and they often choose pieces based on things like art over stats.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about very hardcore raiders who no longer could eyeball a piece of gear with any degree of authority. I might believe that some very few of you are so proficient with the math as to be able to eyeball the stats, but I think you are vastly overestimating the number of players who can or do. Remember, the formula to convert armor penetration into damage was so complicated that we had to take the unusual step of actually spelling out how it was calculated.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is absolutely dumbing down the game and removing yet another aspect of the game that gave it depth. There is only a limited number of items designed for each class/spec and you will only see a small number of those drop. If you just picked up items that are obviously designed for your class/spec with highest ilvl, your gear would be perfectly fine for the content that we have today. Those of us who want to spend more time can pull out a spreadsheet and analyze every last detail of their gear choices to squeeze out more performance. Furthermore, unless they turn the stats into a completely trivial system, a spreadsheet will still be needed for analyzing gear.<br />
<br />
This change has likely nothing to do with improving the players' experience; It's more likely that Blizzard has realized that itemization is hard when the stat system is complex, so to save themselves some time and effort they just make it simpler.</div></div><hr />

Don't kid your self,<br />
Burning Crusade was announced October 28th, 2005 and released on January 16th, 2007. WotLK was announced on August 3, 2007 and was released November 13, 2008. Point is: Cataclysm is still a *long* way off and getting season 7 isn't a waste since the ex-pak wont be out for about a year.</div></div><hr />

I find many of these arguments to be elitist. This is not a &quot;catering to the casuals&quot; issue. This is an issue that even some of our most educated and math-savy players could not make gear decisions without the help of external tools. We're much less concerned about more casual players because the specific choice of upgrade will mean less for them (skill outweighs the contribution of stats for all but the absolute best players) and they often choose pieces based on things like art over stats.<br />
<br />
I'm talking about very hardcore raiders who no longer could eyeball a piece of gear with any degree of authority. I might believe that some very few of you are so proficient with the math as to be able to eyeball the stats, but I think you are vastly overestimating the number of players who can or do. Remember, the formula to convert armor penetration into damage was so complicated that we had to take the unusual step of actually spelling out how it was calculated.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is absolutely dumbing down the game and removing yet another aspect of the game that gave it depth. There is only a limited number of items designed for each class/spec and you will only see a small number of those drop. If you just picked up items that are obviously designed for your class/spec with highest ilvl, your gear would be perfectly fine for the content that we have today. Those of us who want to spend more time can pull out a spreadsheet and analyze every last detail of their gear choices to squeeze out more performance. Furthermore, unless they turn the stats into a completely trivial system, a spreadsheet will still be needed for analyzing gear.<br />

Exactly!!! Right now we have people that are too lazy to do the easy math in their heads so they get a spreadsheet about what gear is best for them, it doesn't matter how few stats you have on gear, we're still going to have lazy people that want a spreadsheet to tell them what gear to put on. Geeze bliz, the diversity of the stats used to be a great aspect of the game, it allowed me to to try unique builds, and helped make my character my own rather than a cookie cutter of everyone else's character. This is the first step toward homogenizing all the classes. Soon we'll just have 1 of 4 stats on any gear at all, stam, str, attack power or intel. The talent trees are probably far too complicated to, I mean after all, we have people going to spreadsheets for those to, lets just take the trees down to 2 talents each. And hopefully in a few patches we'll have shaved off some of those 'confusing' hybrid classes as well, so we'll just have Fighter, Wizard, Priest. and our spellbooks will be &quot;Item, Magic or Run&quot;</div></div><hr />
