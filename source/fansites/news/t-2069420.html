<br />
Kosumoth the Hungering Orbs Hotfixed<br />
In addition to the hotfixes below, players are reporting (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2068651-PSA-Kosumoth-the-Hungering-mount-pet-made-easier) that the orbs for Kosumoth the Hungering are now clickable by multiple people. <br />

Shifting into Bear Form will no longer freeze resource decay for non-Guardian druids.<br />

<br />
Barrage range will now correctly match the range of the Hunter’s other abilities.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: During the recent updates to Barrage, we discovered it extended approximately 2 yards beyond the range of autoshot and other abilities. We’re changing it to more closely match.<br />
<br />

<br />
Soul Shards now regenerate to 3, while out of combat (up from 1).<br />
<br />
Developers' Notes: As discussed in last week’s Developer Q&amp;A, warlocks (and Demonology especially) needed to go through several spellcasts in order to generate the Soul Shards required to cast the spells needed for them to operate at peak efficiency. In outdoor gameplay and against packs of enemies in dungeons, this often meant that combat was ending just as the warlock was getting warmed up. Allowing warlocks to begin combat with 3 Soul Shards instead of 1 should let them bring more of their arsenal to bear in shorter encounters.<br />

<br />
Mannoroth's Bloodletting Manacles now heals the warrior based on base Rage spent, rather than actual rage spent, to account for Rage cost reduction effects.<br />
(Arms) Colossus Smash's cooldown reduced to 30s.<br />
<br />
Developers' Notes: The cooldown on Colossus Smash serves as bad luck protection against long streaks of Tactician not activating. At 45 seconds, the worst case scenario of actually waiting for the full cooldown to elapse was a rare occurrence that was particularly noticeable (and frustrating) when it happened. At 30 seconds, the majority of the time Colossus Smash will still reset before its cooldown elapses, but those unlucky streaks should feel a little better.<br />
<br />
<br />
(Arms) Focused Rage's damage bonus reduced to 40% per stack.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons<br />
<br />
Luck of the Draw (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/72221-luck-of-the-draw) now properly increases pet and guardian damage.<br />
Assault on Violet Hold<br />
<br />
Sael'orn will no long aggro players immediately when she spawns.<br />
Fel Prison will no longer target healers in Heroic and Mythic difficulty.<br />
<br />
Maw of Souls<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue where Nether Rip didn’t appear on lower graphics settings.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
(Hotfix work in progress) Emissary bags from completing World Quests now contain equippable items for your class.<br />
The Derelict Skyhorn Kite (http://www.wowdb.com/items/131810-derelict-skyhorn-kite) now has a 15 minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
NPCs<br />
<br />
The Imperial Arcanist and the Imperial Spellbreaker that spawn in front of Lothrius Mooncaller’s room in Suramar – The Athenaeum no longer drop loot or grant experience when killed by the Moonfall Manafiend summoned by a player or by Lothrius Mooncaller.<br />
Regular creatures at Warden Towers should spawn more rapidly when attacked by many players.<br />
Brimstone Destroyers in Azsuna can no longer be enslaved.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Mother's Skinning Knife (http://www.wowdb.com/items/130102-mothers-skinning-knife) is now only usable by players who know Skinning.<br />
Several Alchemy quests which required Heroic Dungeon kills can now be completed in Mythic.<br />
Engineering<br />
<br />
Players should no longer be able to skill up Engineering in Legion by making Gearspring Parts. It should now be slightly easier to skill up to 800 by making goggles or Trigger.<br />
The Arcanic Compressor is now multi-drop and can be looted several engineers in a group for completion of “Revamping the Recoil”.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Several followers have had the effectiveness of their abilities reduced against players.<br />
Fixed an issue causing some PvP World Quests to have invalid rewards for Honor level 50 players.<br />
Flickering Shadows (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/197256-flickering-shadows?artifactRank=1) will no longer activate if the Rogue is capturing a point in Domination maps such as Arathi Basin.<br />
The time between Wintergrasp and Tol Barad battles has been increased to 1 hour.<br />
Skirmish victories now award 100 honor (was 50).<br />
The first random battleground win of the day now rewards a Soldier's Splendor (250 Artifact Power).<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
In the Warrior Class Campaign Ulduar Scenario, the door after Brood Queen Morvaniss should now always open when you kill her.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the World Quest “Ley Race”, ley line nodes should now spawn more quickly as you go.<br />
Death Knights should no longer become stuck on “Steeds of the Damned”.<br />
Druids should no longer be stuck on “Gathering the Dreamweavers”.<br />
Players that manage to find themselves in the &quot;Champions of Elune&quot; scenario without a vehicle will now be teleported out after 30 seconds.<br />
Bind on Equip items have been removed as possible rewards from World Quests.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: As a player’s own item level increases, the quality of many World Quest item rewards rises as well. However, when these items can circulate throughout the economy, they can overshadow other sources of loot, and crafted items especially. World Quests should feel rewarding, but we want that to be because of a direct value to your character.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Warden Tower World Quests are now on 6 hour rotations (was 3 hours).<br />
Withered in the Withered Army Training scenario should now be able to throw rocks from point blank range. Ow!<br />

Hidden Artifact Appearances<br />
We can confirm that the processes for obtaining these alternate appearances are all in the game and functioning properly. Once you’ve met all the appropriate requirements – some of which involve content that hasn’t yet been released, or will take some time to complete – the appearance will be granted to your character.

Warden Tower Hotfix<br />
do you dislike people getting honor via towers or was the nerf to prevent people from feeling the need to do em every 3 hours?<br />
We like how rewarding the towers are for the time spent, but don't want them to be the primary source of Honor. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/439347-updates-from-warcraftdevs-patch-703/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17612821173?page=3#42))<br />
<br />
Druid Armor Set Legs<br />
Good news to share here - this should be fixed in patch 7.1.<br />
<br />
The issue stemmed from the chest piece of the Druid set not having the bottom half of the robe set correctly. I also noticed that a similar issue affected the Mage Order Hall Leggings, which were using the Druid set skin, so those have been fixed as well.<br />
<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What design decision do you regret the most, from all games?<br />
I have a lot of regrets about Raid Finder for WoW. I am sure I worked on features that were much, much worse, but that's the first one that came to mind.<br />
<br />
To be clear, the goal of getting more players into raiding is a good one. But the way Raid Finder turned out removed, IMO anyway, a lot of the epicness of what made raiding raiding. I also haven't played WoW in a few years, so it's entirely possible they have solved the problem by now. (Source (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/52fxo1/ama_league_design_lead_greg_ghostcrawler_street/d7jxqve?context=3))<br />
<br />
You've explained before that back in the days in WoW you wanted to nerf frost mages. How come frost mages were pretty much left untouched for such a long long time? What's the process behind getting something nerfed/buffed like and who has the final word when something gets nerfed/buffed (at Blizzard and Riot Games)? <br />
The less diplomatic answer is that there were a lot of WoW devs who played Frost mages, even though I wasn't one of them, so there were always a lot of people to point out your potential mistakes when you try to make a change.<br />
<br />
But above and beyond that, it was a tricky design space, because Frost mages were supposed to be good at both tankiness (emergency buttons that cover you in ice) and burst (ice lance combos). When you are good at defense and offense (especially burst), you are walking a razor's edge all the time. (Source (https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/52fxo1/ama_league_design_lead_greg_ghostcrawler_street/d7jzkp6?context=3))<br />
<br />
One of your former colleagues, Chris Metzen, just announced that he was retiring at 42. I know Chris as the legendary creator of Diablo, Starcraft and Warcraft, my childhood, but can you tell me what Chris was like in the office and how you feel about him <br />
Chris was a rockstar. That guy you saw on stage at Blizzard? That's 100% legit Metzen. He'd call us brothers and sisters. He'd call us cats. I think once he called me baby. I can't get away with talking like that, but he didn't fake it. That's who he was. He bleeds for his story, his characters, Blizzard, and most importantly, the players.<br />
<br />
I first met him at a party, a few years before I went to work at Blizzard. He yelled at the top of his voice in a Scottish (dwarvish?) accent the entire time.<br />
<br />
Sometimes in meetings he would get a far off stare, and you'd know something was bubbling up inside his mind and something great was about to come out.<br />
<br />
Once at Blizzcon, he hugged me for like a really long time in the middle of a busy men's room. We blocked the doorway and made a lot of people wait in line that much longer.<br />
<br />
A possibly apocryphal story: when Kaplan was new to Blizzard, Metzen came into his office, crashed on the couch for like an hour nap, woke up, asked &quot;Do you know why they won't let us drink at work any longer?&quot; Got up and left. (P.S. Blizzard let us drink at work all the time, so I'm not sure what that was all about.)<br />
<br />
And maybe my favorite story. At a Blizzcon party we were all at, there was inexplicably a bowl of powdered donuts with the snacks. Chris took a donut, rubbed it under his nose (so that there's this light dusting of white powder) and then left it there all night as he bearhugged and did the Top Gun high-five to everyone at the party.<br />
<br />
He's one of the top 5 or so most authentic and yet almost supernatural forces I've ever met. I am lucky to know him. (Source (http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler/answers/140669739147))<br />

Of course, he is talking about much earlier days, 8-10 years ago by now. I imagine things have gotten more regulated and more professional as time has gone on, as is usually the case. Along with a lot more red tape too, of course, which is why things take so much longer to do these days than they used to. Certainly in the earlier days, I bet things like this went on all the time though, when WoW had a smaller team.</div></div><hr />

The problem with LFR is that it invites the mindset that you can ignore mechanics. You can stand in abilities that, in certain dungeons or normal mode, would be deemed lethal and not care. I think normal mode is an appropriate entry level for raiding currently. LFR is literally &quot;Do shit all, get free loot&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why can't they just say which ones involve content that hasn't been released yet? Where's the fun in seeing the entire community come together on a wild goose chase looking for clues that don't even exist yet? <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2016-09-14, 06:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with LFR is that it's too big for random players. Maybe even 10 random players would be too many. We obviously know that 5 players works fine, just look at dungeon finder. The question is where is the roof on where people just stop caring. Another problem with LFR of course is the loot, it's always going to be subpar with everything else. Even if you have close to normal mechanics it just means more wiping and the reason for this is because there are too many random people involved. Instead they went with the most simple solution to make them super easy, but then you have even more issues, with people afking, doing nothing at all and so forth. It's a complete mess, poor loot, too easy and too many random people involved.<br />
<br />
At least they are allowing for set items to drop in LFR that's very nice, I didn't even do LFR in wod because it was garbage and totally pointless. Now you could run it on your junk alts to build a set if you're bored at least(with minimal effort involved).</div></div><hr />

This. &quot;No, no, all the processes for obtaining the appearances are in the game, just some are in content that isn't accessible yet and you don't know which huehuehuehue.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Its originally intention was for players to see the content. Many did not get to see much of ICC or Ulduar (despite ICC being fairly easy in the last few months of wrath). I remember it being called a tourist mode of raiding, but then decent gear got thrown in with it and once that decision was made it stopped being a &quot;tourist&quot; mode.<br />
<br />
If they want it to be a way for the player to see the content. Just make a solo &quot;scenario&quot; version of it. Where it is a do once and done sort of deal.</div></div><hr />

I've always jokingly said that when salty about a puzzling nerf or ignored issues. To realize it's actually true in some cases, kind of stings. You think Blizzard is this big professional company with processes and chain of command for addressing balance, but.. nope! It's just some guys, debating things like we do in these forums, some classes overrepresented or protected due to personal interests, while others may not have representation at all. That really does answer a lot of questions.<br />
<br />
Also: &quot;it's entirely possible they have solved the [LFR] problem by now&quot; -- lol, nope.<br />
<br />
Don't ignore what he went on to say.<br />
&quot;so there were always a lot of people to point out your potential mistakes when you try to make a change.&quot;.<br />
<br />
It wasn't &quot;Hey, we play frost, don't nerf me bro&quot;, but more of &quot;Hey, we play frost, here's the issues with that nerf idea&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also I'd go as far as saying the Hungering Orbs have no CD now, no one's waiting at any of them when I checked last night, and the people who were coming in were trickling in and using it instantly.</div></div><hr />

I think that's kind of narrow minded, considering the vast number of things that could be done in the game that could be &quot;epic&quot;. I think it's kind of an old fashioned concept, and as WoW ages, so does that mindset. <br />
<br />
Too much of the game breaks down to a Dr. Seuss Sneetches scenario, the star bellied Sneetches sneering at the blank bellied Sneetches. GC's attitude towards LFR feeds into that exact mindset.</div></div><hr />

I was not that excited from the fact that we got it down, but i even let out a yell when it dropped some boots and i won them.<br />
<br />
I can't feel any epic, just kill me... now to think, i don't really even want to feel epic. Like i don't want to be some great hero in games. Like &quot;commander&quot; in WoD or whatever in legion.</div></div><hr />

Just because you personally can't live without LFR, doesn't make you an expert in what will or will not kill WoW. Most people run LFR because they can, and not because they have no other choice. Statistically speaking, WoW had the most subscriber numbers prior to LFR. LFR made those numbers drop and there's a logical explanation to that: people see the end-game content (if you can call LFR that) in a night or two and see no reason to continue their subscription until a new content arrives.</div></div><hr />

That may be your experience (and some at arrogant opinion) But it's not mine. Most people I know never get to see raids because either they're not in the &quot;in crowd&quot; or the elitists in their guild don't consider them good enough or the guild is too small to field enough people interested in raiding. LFR was their ONLY choice.<br />
<br />
As for your bizarre their as to why subs when down, there is no proven causal link there at all. Perhaps you need to examine the quality of Cata itself. This was one of the most panned expansions and a lot of people did not enjoy it. The only thing that kept me playing was LFR because I FINALLY got to see the end of the expansion.<br />
<br />
It's well known that prior to LFR, less than 10% of the customer base raided or could get into raids. The other 90% are also customers. They were being shafted.<br />

That doesn't change the fact that the majority were happier when they actually got to see the inside of raids when LFR got in. Blizzard themselve stated back in Wrath that between 5% to 10% participated in raiding.<br />
<br />
The only people who seem to have got their nose out of joint regarding LFR were some of the epeen raiders. They believed something was taken away from them by making it more avaliable to others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, because I continue to sub and play because I enjoy real raiding. The casuals are the ones that were hurt most by LFR. They get the raid they see it and get bored and unsub till the next patch. They didn't do that before when raiding was this thing they could do if they decided to and spend most of their time in dungeons. The fact that LFR exists hurts casual players because blizzard sees it as your end game and they have to do nothing for it. Back in the old days they'd spend a significant amount of time adding a lot of dungeons and continuing to add them with patches. Normal should be nerfed, LFR should be removed and dungeons should be the focus of casual end game like it was in Wrath.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Funny how then after the introduction of LFR, we see a steady drop in subscriber numbers. Now correlation doesn't mean causation by any means. But you cannot deny the correlation either.<br />
Even without LFR, starting raiding was never difficult either. You had guilds at every stage in the progression, and merely grouping up with others through 5 mans, you often made connections with people. The only thing it asked from you was to dedicate a time slot to play with other people. New guilds were formed often enough, and guilds generally always had a spot open for a competent player.<br />
If you had done some networking (meaning, did 5 mans with people in the tier above you), it was easy enough to get noticed as a good player.<br />
<br />
If you are incapable of that, why the hell are you playing an MMO in the first place?<br />
<br />
I personally don't care whether someone has access to the same content as myself but at a lower difficulty. Great for them. And I believe most of the mythic scene has the same mentality. LFR isn't intended for us, so why would we care? If anything, LFR itself is more damaging to the more casual players, because it gives them the illusion of having &quot;finished&quot; the game. Which leads to moaning and bitching of &quot;Oh my god blizz, there is nothing to do, gief new content&quot; a month into a patch cycle, which then might lead to an unsub.<br />
Before that, those same players would still have had a final goal to work towards (also helped that Blzizard at the time still added in 5man content for those players).</div></div><hr />
