It means that we beat the normal modes when they were still challenging and although we would have rather tried hard modes when they were hard, they will likely still pose us a challenge. It will also mean that the bosses that we still do on normal we can kill faster and have more time for heroic attempts =)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alysrazor &quot;molts&quot; in her fight, and if you pick up a feather, it lets you cast while moving and move faster. If you get three, you can fly and attack Alysrazor in the sky - it's a key mechanic of the fight.</div></div><hr />

I hope you meant 3 healing. You were supposed to two heal before, so the nerfs make the two healers jobs easier allowing for a third, or just two heal and kill bosses faster.</div></div><hr />

I understand you are a pro player and all, but no &quot;super casual guild&quot; is 6/7 heroic. I wouldn't even necessarily say that a &quot;super casual&quot; guild would raid 6 hours a week.</div></div><hr />

I guess bang our heads against heroic ragnaros, but with 15% less damage even he will be significantly easier. Looking forward to months and months of trivial farming...

I would have been fine with an ICC like approach, if they had started bumping it up slowly like they did for ICC. At this point I think they needed to do some catchup and this will make for some interesting &quot;new&quot; raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You always could 3heal fights without worrying about enrage mechanics, save perhaps for Baleroc and Ragnaros hc.<br />
<br />
These nerfs, on heroic, are unnecessary and uncalled for. I don't necessarily mind all non-Rag boss nerfs, just makes farm faster for us. But the Rag hc one, was not only pointless (adds already really don't hit for that much anyway, after the other nerf they implemented), but also a knee below the belts of raiders who're working on Rag and really aren't waiting for a nerf.<br />
<br />
And anyone on heroic who IS waiting for a nerf really needs to reconsider their setup and players. Really. It's not hard, and nobody should be in heroic if you hit any sort of wall for so long. If you do, your issues go way beyond boss' HP.<br />
<br />
Blizzard clearly disagrees and believes any form of challenge should be killed as fast as we usually steamroll through heroic bosses on a weekday.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Schizoide</div><div class="date">2011-09-20, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">From my perspective, Ragnaros was the only even remotely tough fight on normal since it required coordination and placed an emphasis on individual player awareness, and while all the hardmodes are more challenging, only Ragnaros heroic is a real hard wall. Or rather it WAS a hard wall. Now, no problem.<br />
<br />
Edit: Det, nobody's complaining about nerfs happening, we just didn't expect 15-25% on day one! We expected them to be gradual like ICC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wasn't going for a &quot;Look at me I'm pro&quot; rather a &quot;If we can do it, it can't be that hard&quot;. We raid twice a week, monday and thursday, starting at 20 and ending at 23. At times we'll go on until 24 if no one has to leave, but at 23 everyone are free to leave. I'm guessing it might be a different definition of &quot;super casual&quot;, but at least our raiding hours aren't very stressful. We obviously pot, flask, food, give each other criticism and all that which I think of as part of raiding at any level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because T11 was nerfed when it wasn't relevant anymore and any raider who took themselves seriously had no business there anyway. Quite different now, isn't it? (Edit: not to mention they left heroic alone, as it should)<br />
<br />
On the bright side, our altruns could probably easily do heroic mode now even with failpugs. :(</div></div><hr />

Its nice to have nerfed regular modes for players who haven't been able to do the entire broad range of the content, this is true. But hardmodes? I mean hardmodes are selective and its supposed to be a super challenge to get them done and a matter of pride. My 10m guild is 2/7 heroic right now and i can honestly say that its kinda lame that we had six billion years to farm heroic content in T11, but hardly any time to progress through these heroics. Whatever, that means newer content is going to &quot;supposedly&quot; come sooner but for our group it just means less challenge (ie less fun in HMs) and more &quot;farm&quot; on bosses that should be giving us trouble while we wait for more content.I really dont care all that much and I can see what Blizzard means to do-- they cant keep everyone happy :-(</div></div><hr />

Only normals were nerfed in T11.<br />

Our guild was 4/7 H prenerf. and that was pretty impressive for the server we are on. <br />

These nerfs are unneccessary. And with Looking for raid aka &quot;ROFLSTOMP YAY EPICZ&quot; mode, it will EASIER than normal modes WITH the 20% nerfs.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cursingmonk</div><div class="date">2011-09-20, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We will see when 4.3 comes out but the only issue most hardcore raiders would have is this makes even most of the hard modes lolerpwn easy. Thus guilds that normally would have struggled to get 2-5 HM before 4.3 will now have 2-5 HM down within the next few weeks. <br />
<br />
This gives them a much higher gear advantage for 4.3 (including more legendaries). Thus what is a &quot;normal mode&quot; guild that normally would only be able to polish off a few heroics will now have an item level high enough to out gear 4.3 normal mode content. This will make more guilds &quot;hard mode&quot; guilds in 4.3. <br />
<br />
This will cause another problem for blizzard, these people that think they are pro in FL with getting some higher progression and gear will expect the same out of 4.3. They will not spend a lot of time in normal mode content and will bang their heads against the wall trying to just get 1-2 HM in 4.3. Stale progression is never a good thing for guilds either. Blizz has 2 options then<br />
1. Make 4.3 tuned to be harder in normal modes, compensating for all of this<br />
2. Put out an expansion 3-5 months after 4.3 release.<br />
<br />
I really hope 4.3 is a lot harder. With the exception of H.Rag and maybe Baleroc(25) or Bethy (10) this expansion has been relatively easy. I will reiterate that I am in favor of nerfs and I think nearly everyone who plays should be able to see the raiding content at some point, even if that is a tier or 2 behind but I am not in favor of casual guilds having access to the same gear that the hardcores work very hard for. EZ mode raiding in 4.3 will have an even lesser effect if people already have a mix of H. FL gear.</div></div><hr />

This doesn't really help those that are struggling learn to play better when they can just wait for Blizzard to &quot;soften things up&quot; a few months later then having those same bads require ridiculous things from pugs (LFM H Firelands, link achievement and ilvl 380 or better or no invite). I would have thought possibly that the nerfs would have been slowly fed in to allow folks some aid to clearing the content while actually learning and playing better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HP was nerfed 2 weeks ago? So technically they already did. At least they have the decent common sense to nerf everything and not just push Normal modes into oblivion leaving Heroics unscathed. <br />

By nerfing everything, everyone who isn't done can push forward to something new, by nerfing just normal, a handful of guild stuck on something on normal get to push forward, everyone else is just still bored.</div></div><hr />

I understand normal mode nerfs. They want to make sure everyone who pays the subscription fee gets to kill the bosses. I disagree with the premise but I understand the thought process.<br />
<br />
There is really no reason to nerf heroics though. I was looking forward to slowly progressing through the rest of that content.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2011-09-20, 06:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh wow, people....ever since TBC there have been nerfs (oh yeah, KT and LV dropping 25 vials instead of 4 WAS a nerf) and people still cry crocodile tears as if SWP 3.0, Naxx in WotLK or ICC buff never happened. Unbelieveable.<br />
<br />
Let's see... <br />
<br />
TBC nerfs: - 20 or 30% HP on all raids and dungeons at the end of the EXPANSION... like 2 months away from WotKL and all thanks to talents changes that made them change the fights in the 1st place since some skills would not be avaiable anymore making some mechanics impossible to beat. Impossible with the mechanics, pathetic without it. But 2 months later, WotLK hits, so, no problem.<br />
<br />
WotLK: Ok, this one is tricky, the expansion alread started nerfed, lol@5man, lol@naxxramas. But the game got back to normal in Ulduar (thanks to Sarth3D success, who would think that the playerbase would enjoy hardmodes more than roflstomping?), they nerfed it a little here and there after Ulduar was not current tier anymore (but never near the TBC's end nerf or T11 nerf), ToC remained the same with just a few adjustements here and there (if any) and ICC got a +30% damage/healing only (no HP loss on bosses) buff after more than 2 months. Also, not all at once, but increments of 5% each 2 or 3 weeks.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm: Heroics nerfed a few weeks later, normal T11 raids nerfed here and there just after, huge nerfbat for normal T11 raids for bosses' damage, HP and mechanics after the patch cycle (when 4.2 hits). Firelands adjustements here and there during the first 2 months (including rag HP nerf on those), after these 2 months, huge nerfbats on bosses' damage, HP and mechanics and there is still more coming since we're supposed to have more 4 months of 4.2 ahead of us.<br />
<br />
Do you really call those the same? Do you really call the adjustement on KT/LV vials (for just a mere raid atunement quest) a huge nerf compared to -25% boss dmg and health?<br />
<br />

why are people surprised saying 15% nerfs are huge when we had 20% nerfs in tier 11?<br />
<br />
Maybe because 15% for normal and heroic in 2 months (and increasing) is higher than 20% for normal after 6 months?</div></div><hr />

How could people be stuck not being able to down normal mode? They can only nerf things so far before the raid doesnt even matter any longer and thats how it is now. I can't imagine people needing a nerf on normal mode, it is amazing that people are the slow in the head to do a raid that simple.<br />

This is just like america business, YOU run a shitty and horrible managed guild and raid leading to massive FAIL so blizzard gives you a BAILOUT for being fail. The best part is that after all these nerfs you are still fail and always be with the way you are running your raids. 6 hours a week is more than enough considering normal mode takes just over 2 hours to clear.<br />
<br />
No matter the nerfs bad will always be bad, ICC with 30% buff proved that. Once the lol Icc raids were over, bads and casuals were right back to failing again once they didnt have a 30% buff to carry them.</div></div><hr />

Totally what was expected. They said they wanted everyone to be able to see the content, which implies downing H. Rag before x-mas when 4.3 comes out. It is not like they were going do a 2% health nerf on normal and 1% nerf in heroic.</div></div><hr />

That is about too, the wrath babies that got all their loot handed to them with a lol 30% buff thinking they are good raiders then new content comes out and cries of difficulty in 5-man heroics and new raids being too hard start right away because they dont have a 30% buff carrying them.<br />

Thank you captain obvious... guess saying &quot;untouched&quot; wasn't a good enough clue to you that I alread counted with the rag HP nerf...<br />
<br />
And where was said that heroic modes where for everyone and to be pushed trough? Sorry. They only need to nerf things because they nerfed the things before it. You learn to play the game, you don't need nerfs anymore. If this isn't true, all players in the world would be 0/7 normal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand normal mode nerfs. They want to make sure everyone who pays the subscription fee gets to kill the bosses. I disagree with the premise but I understand the thought process.<br />
<br />
There is really no reason to nerf heroics though. I was looking forward to slowly progressing through the rest of that content. These 15-25 percent nerfs will shorten the time it takes to finish everything up considerably. I really just hope Im not sitting on my hands for 3 months waiting for 4.3.<br />
<br />
I've thought a lot about heroics. We've had Rag down for over a month now, but due to real life issues of our core raid group have been filling a lot of raid spots with people who have never been to FL in the first place. Because of this we have not had a chance to start heroics yet. I was looking forward to doing them as is, but I'm ok with the changes and here is why. There are a lot of guilds who are good enough to get to 6/7 or 7/7 normal and find a lot of those fights easy enough, but aren't really good enough to be working on heroics as they stand. By nerfing most of the encounters by 25%, basically regular mode fights will become faceroll easy, so what do the guilds at the middle of the bell curve do til 4.3 then? If heroics aren't nerfed, they are still too difficult for these players, but now the regulars are so easy as to not even be fun anymore. This opens up new raiding content to a lot of guilds and will keep people playing until 4.3 is available. I know it lessens the achievement of killing these bosses for a few, but the reality is that if your guild were good enough (whether that be through attendance and commitment or skill) you'd be 6/7 heroic by now. My guild has the skill to have worked on hard modes as they were, but not the commitment to raiding to make it happen, so I'll be happy to do them 15% easier, which should allow us to get in there and keep having fun as opposed to clearing 7/7 in 2 1/2 hours every week with nothing else to do.</div></div><hr />

This mechanic is for people that are popping magma traps (not warlocks with teleport) and are in midair when they get hit by Wrath of Ragnaros and redirected into the lava with never a hope to return. It's a shitty RNG targeting mechanic that I've experienced multiple times while I was falling back down.

<br />
And where was said that heroic modes where for everyone and to be pushed trough? Sorry. They only need to nerf things because they nerfed the things before it. You learn to play the game, you don't need nerfs anymore. If this isn't true, all players in the world would be 0/7 normal.<br />
<br />
Why learn to play a game that the baddies will cry and whine about and will be eventually nerfed? It is pathetic of Blizzard to ruin the game over people with very low IQ's and lack the ability to hit a few buttons and move out of fire. The baddies already get all the good parking spots now they want to come to WOW and ruin the game for everyone with a brain and heartbeat.</div></div><hr />

Now I'll be able to. Sounds good to me. Rage more, haters.<br />

Blizzards philosophy is to let as many as possible see every raid before the next is introduced, but then why isn't the nerfs to normal mode sufficient...? Oh well, I don't really care.<br />
<br />
Because as long as this game becom just a gear farm festival, item level means content. So when a player demands to see the content in firelands, they demand leaving the place with their bags full of 378 on the 1st week and next week 391 when heroic opens. It's like bothering with how many candies you'll be able to eat while watching a movie on theater, &quot;to the hell with the movie, meh wantz candies&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, even if shannox and shannox heroic are exactly the same boss character (wich means 0 content in heroic), Blizzard now consider that they delivered to you new 2 bosses, 2 new content. So Firelands = 14 bosses... T11 was a awesome amount of 25 bosses! The most content ever made!!! Success.</div></div><hr />

Haha this, i think some normal mode guilds struggling on normal rag are getting a bit delusional, those nerfs won't make up for your inability to play this game, sorry.<br />

It makes farming faster/more boring and screws actual progression guilds that either had attendence issues or just formed and/or started doing firelands later. Thats it, thats all. Really bad move.<br />

Rage away Mr. Smallest Minority Of The Playerbase.<br />
Subscription losses talk, Hardcore bullshit walks, deal with it. <br />
Shitting on the majority of your customer base to please a minority was a huge mistake and continues to be.<br />
Raid only gems/recipes and Tier gear will further erode a playerbase sick and tired of Blizzard regurgitating the same crap from vanilla they swore they were going away from.<br />

Took the words right out of my mouth. Pugging 2 people for months now and getting hard modes down while only raiding 10hours a week sucks.<br />

Even though I agree with you, your statement doesn't really matter. Casuals are what pay the bills for Blizzard, not the people that are hardcore. This is how it is with all games now, same reason Console ports to PC are happening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Less than 3 months - 4.2 landed June 30th.<br />
<br />
There are close to 2000 guilds that are 6/7 heroic, and many of us were close to a kill. Handing us a win, so we can sit around for 3 months until new content lands, is ridiculous. Doing so with only a week's warning just makes it even worse. Because the hardest fight in the game really needed back to back nerfs 2 weeks apart.</div></div><hr />

So if your guild hasnt put 6 bosses on hardmode farm already, then your QQ should really be aimed somewhere else because you have had 3 months to progress. At the point the only way you were gonna progress further thru it was by becoming on par or outgearing the boss encounters as compared to other guilds who did it sooner on lesser gear.</div></div><hr />

If you were oh so &quot;good&quot; you would be done and your riding of the high horse would be granted. If you aren't, too bad should have finished. Hate to break that arrogant bubble, but you aren't the best, you aren't the benchmark...like most people you are the middle of the road or maybe just a little above. This nerf is very early, but that's life. If we were all as good as we think we are we would be done. Heroic Mode people telling normal mode folks they suck sometimes forget its that sexy heroic mode gear that made those normal so faceroll, just like all middle raids. None the less the nerf is soon, I know because my guild is a middle of the road guild. We get all normals done and a couple heroics before every nerf normally. We lost two weeks of raiding which means we probably would have been through Domo and working rags if we hadn't lost those two weeks. So this nerf does feel early since things have been at this pace since late BC and Wrath for us. The only reason T11 was behind for us is we didn't start raiding until end of Feburary, so we didn't see T11 heroics, prior to FL. Still I wish they would have waited until November for this nerf. Still would have given the one night raiders their chance to see all 7 bosses, similar to an alt raid I run. That raid would have been fine to see FL in November...now I get to raid FL two lockouts a week for the next three months...joy. I don't hate the nerf, but after 10 weeks seems a little quick.For everyone raging and hating...chill. Why be concerned about others? Lots of factors play into the success of a raid, and I have to say keeping people in guild this expansion has been harder than any previously and it has nothing to do with being bad guild leaders or being a &quot;shitty company&quot; as someone referenced. Its Blizzard pissing people off on all kinds of fronts that have caused player losses in my guild. Thanks for shitting on pvp so much that I'm loosing raiders. Also real life happens some people are sick of the game after 5 to 6 years. Stop raging at one another. Being more progressed than someone else isn't always a skill issue. Only people I find good at this game have achieves back to BC for being in the top of their server repeatedly. Just being good for one expansion doesn't mean shit. I've seen bads carried through heroics on plenty of occasions.</div></div><hr />

Back when I was in SUPER HARDCORE OMG SERVER FIRST mode, it used to piss me off that Blizzard would make stuff easier for everyone (because my guild had already killed it when it was hard) but honestly that sort of attitude is sort of ridiculous.

<br />
Really, the Rag nerfs happened a couple of weeks ago and it's not getting re-nerfed as far as I read. As of today on guildox, there are 32 US guilds with a H-Rag kill. I'm pretty sure anyone who isn't already 6/7 heroic won't likely be killing H-Rag this tier unless there are further nerfs.</div></div><hr />

oh get off your high horse, blizz just caters to the vast majority that pays for their bills. The hardcore players only represent roughly 2-5% of the wow community.</div></div><hr />

WTB consistent raiders so we can actually achieve what we should be rather than looking like idiots(16% on Rag = 6% away from heroics = irritatingly close). Also blizzard, really? first day 25% nerf to all bosses? We're already clearing 6/7 on tuesday nights.<br />
<br />
Consistency is critical. My 10man fell apart due to continual problems with raiders coming onboard and then either dropping WoW altogether or simply rearranging their life. It's their right to do so, but it can really sabotage a good group.</div></div><hr />

Then nerf doesn't take away what you where able to accomplish. You put in the hard work to get where you are and no one can take that away from you but stop trying to make everyone else feel bad because they didn't do it just as you did. Its a game for heavens sake not real life. If this is the only thing you can really feel proud about i feel sorry for you, just continue to play the game or don't idc. I for one welcome the changes, the nerf didn't change mechanics so if you weren't able to move out of fire before, chances are you wont move now. all this did was make it so that ppl who were close to advancing get a lil something extra to help push them over. deal with it</div></div><hr />

It isn't about new people doing what others have already done. It's about nerfing what is left on the table. Less than 200 guilds, or a thousand people in the world have had enough time to finish the instance, but many are pretty close. There are still months to go before 4.3. Most of the people complaining would rather it be a choice to turn down the diffficulty level instead of the only option. Heroic content is supposed to be hard.</div></div><hr />

It allows players that have been struggling an opportunity to enjoy the latest content and gear while it's &quot;new&quot;. For all the elitests out there that are QQing that Blizzard has taken the challenge out of the game by nerfing it...if you're so l33t, why are you even bothering with content you must have already conquered repeatedly?There's really only three perspective players , the ones that don't care, the ones that accept the nerf to assist them along, and the ones that are pissed because the prestige is now null and void. So 2/3 are relatively For the nerf.<br />

I can understand and appreciate those that want to do it on the current pre-nerf difficulty i wasn't directing the comment to them. It was directed towards those that feel giving others, who don't have the time to invest as they had, a chance and feel that if everyone can't do what they did then they are tagged as being bad players. It would be nice to have it been more of a scaling down factor than an all out nerf as they did but it wasn't, its just something they have to learn to deal with and know what they did and worry only about that not what others are able to do now.</div></div><hr />

If this is where they wanted to end up, they should have started at Shannox and moved their way through the instance over time with nerfs.<br />
A 1 week warning before nerfing the entire tier of content is BS.</div></div><hr />

The best part is that after all these nerfs you are still fail and always be with the way you are running your raids. 6 hours a week is more than enough considering normal mode takes just over 2 hours to clear.<br />
<br />
No matter the nerfs bad will always be bad, ICC with 30% buff proved that. Once the lol Icc raids were over, bads and casuals were right back to failing again once they didnt have a 30% buff to carry them.<br />

In that case everyone is bad unless you killed pre nerf rag</div></div><hr />

I love gaming and i love to experience more of the heroics, but i can not put any more time into raiding, its just not going to happen. also, lots of love to all these people going hurr hurr horrible nerf, nerfed it waaay to much omg all the noobs will just swim in heroic epics.

We've been stuck on Baleroc of all bosses because we have people that will mess up the shards, or healers who can't eke out that extra heal in .5s or whatever to keep me alive for a Decimation Blade. We should have been cleared by now, or at least working on Rag normal, but almost never having the same raid comp makes that fairly difficult. These nerfs should help us jump those final few hurdles we need.</div></div><hr />

I'm frankly disappointed in these nerfs. Why? Firelands, in comparison to previous content, was generally a walk in the park. I compare it to the ToC of Cataclysm. You had guilds that went 7/7 on release day. Sure, they've released information on T13... but we're not getting it tomorrow. It hasn't even been released on the ptr. So why the need for a nerf so big--right here, right now? There is none. Small 'unprogressed' guilds easily walked through FL. There isn't a real need for the nerfs. Sure, nerf regulars a bit and tweak them. But coming from my perspective, WHY heroics? I am not someone who has gone 7/7h (6/7h, respectively). My group raided very little through this tier (6-9 hours a week). We aren't a fantastic group of raiders--just determined. Most heroic bosses took us one night (except for lovely LR, that's a different story). We didn't struggle like we did in t11... We only made it 10/13H before FL hit... this tier, we've made huge headway and we don't even have the ptr release... My point is: This content isn't hard. More so than anything, this content just requires people who can CONCENTRATE. A nerf won't fix concentration. But, the nerf, regardless, wasn't needed. It's too early and unnecessary. I hear far less people QQ'ing about the difficultly of this content than they did during T11 or heck even T10.... Oh wait... I guess that's because everyone's getting tired of Blizz and quitting the game. Wtg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It makes farming faster/more boring and screws actual progression guilds that either had attendence issues or just formed and/or started doing firelands later. Thats it, thats all. Really bad move.<br />
<br />
Happy about normal mode nerfs though ! Moar loots for my alts :O.<br />
<br />
If rag were the first boss in the instance, you might've been right. <br />
<br />
However, even WITHOUT the nerfs to the sons, this change makes it FAR easier for guilds which aren't raiding every night of the week. Why? Because they'll get waaaayyyyyy more time on that boss now. A guild that was getting 3 or 4 attempts in at the end of the raid will be getting 10+ since all the other bosses in there will be down on the first night with time to spare. (domo, baleroc and the stupid bird will all be trivialised beyond belief now)<br />
<br />
The easier to kill sons and no more people getting randomly knocked back into lavatraps will just make the fight that little less annoying to learn.<br />
<br />
As for why Bliz had to do this, it's simple - they need some sort of gear reset to happen, mostly due to the over-abundance of legendary staffs in top-end guilds, but also because top-end guilds are fully decked out in hard mode gear. This would make balancing the normal mode boss fights a total pain.<br />
<br />
They tried nerfing staff droprates, but that just made the problem worse as the top guilds have them already while 10-man guilds are still working on their first. So, they open up hard modes to all, and nerf them so everyone can farm them as if it's normal mode. But they had to do it in the next week or so, to give them time to farm.</div></div><hr />

As for the nerfs in question, I think they are a bit much but eh, being a casual player (I can only really raid maybe 6 hours a week now because of job) I'll take what ever I can get.
