We might see more progress on Anub'arak today now that a very annoying bug preventing guilds to access the boss after a soft reset has been hotfixed.<br />
A hotfix has been deployed that will prevent the instance from entering a bugged state where Barrett does not spawn after a soft reset. If you haven't gotten to Anub'arak yet, you'll be fine now.<br />
<br />
For those of you already afflicted with this bug in your saved raid, I'm still working on a method to correct the issue via hotfix for everyone so afflicted.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, our customer service staff has been informed how they can resolve the bug for a raid with a bugged instance.</div></div><hr />

Is it a typo or does it give double Cauterizing heal / Searing flames effect? Seeing as both the set bonus and the shiny shard says it adds the effect.</div></div><hr />

Looks like 41. Guess they're embarrassed or something if people knew they wiped 9 times. Almost as funny as people who blur out their chat log.</div></div><hr />

<br />
49 tries left. I guess they didn't want the competition to know they had so large a window to get Anub with.<br />
<br />
I think tries is a much better indicator (in any given week of raiding, anyway) than time. Premo now has the &quot;world best&quot; Twin Valk kill, since attempts rather than time ignores raiding schedule, server uptimes, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Most likely just to gear up more and get their heads fresh. After all, they've raided that place for 11 hours without a break. Method stopped an hour after them and Paragon an hour after that. No use to waste your tries for this week when you're tired and almost guaranteed to wipe and when all your competitors stopped as well. I bet they'll come back tomorrow (today) with fresh minds and give it a better go.</div></div><hr />

I don't have any partials on my Heroic TotGC either, and i'm pretty sure I killed some of them last night. Armory is wrong.</div></div><hr />

You realize that they're two different spells, right? <br />

Possibly one Alliance, one Horde, or perhaps one for the WG siege and one for another (quest) siege..<br />

<br />
Because baby animals are almost always disproportionate. They tend to have bigger head in comparison to their bodies.<br />
<br />
The more pets the better if you ask me.<br />
<br />
Psh why do they waste resources on silly raid achievements. I'd rather step on those and see how cute they squish.</div></div><hr />

You're absolutely right. No digital creation is intended to make a person feel any sort of emotion.<br />

Are you kidding?!? It's brilliant! Hodir takes forever to grind to exalted. No tabards, no rep reward for killing mobs, and only a handful of dailies. I would have killed for hodir rep reward</div></div><hr />
