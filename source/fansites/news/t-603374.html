Okay so you're not a shaman. But before typing some angry bs like this, you might wanna check your sources.<br />

Yes, I am a shaman, however there is a certain group who whined too much about the decreased duration from 10 to 1 minute. &quot;Hey, we have to press 1 button every minute, omg, that's so unfair, let us press 1 button every 10 minutes&quot;. Give me a break, is it so hard to refresh it every minute? So... please show me where in your link it is posted by a blue guy what does &quot;# Water Shield now restores mana periodically regardless of how many charges remain. Duration increased to 10 minutes. (This will result in the same exact amount of mana restored as in the current 2.3 version of the ability)&quot; mean. &quot;Same exact amount of mana restored as in the current 2.3 version of the ability&quot; means 609 mana. So, if it returns the exact same amount of mana over 10 minutes instead of 1, you get 60.9 mana every minute, which translates into 5mp5. Now, compare this to the 50mp5 which is live, and tell me how is this &quot;angry bs&quot;. Until a blue post clarifies it, or the PTR goes up and a shaman actually tests it, i'll post &quot;angry bs&quot; like this.</div></div><hr />

First, blue has confirmed it's basically 50mp5.<br />
<br />
Second, you don't raid do you? Having to recast it every minute during a boss encounter is a big deal. First, you're not always in a position to recast it exactly as it ends. Also, and probably more importantly... do you really like wasting your GCDs during combat? I sure as hell don't. Recasting that means one heal I can't cast at that moment.</div></div><hr />

Clarifies that you've done your math, and I respect that. But when I read &quot;not a nerf&quot; from a CM when they change the same ability 2 times in somes days, I tend to believe it won't be. Because that proves they are trying to effectively buff WS from the first version, and they can't go back after the 2.3 buff.<br />
Casting once per minute WAS annoying, even if not game-breaking. It counters the &quot;fun gameplay&quot; style they are willing to apply to their game.<br />
<br />
I'm betting the 2.3.2 WS won't be as good as a fully proficiency 2.3 WS (meaning being hit every time possible and re-casting it asap), but it still will be more effective than the old one.<br />
<br />
A mana regen over time, instead of a &quot;big&quot; boost at exactly 60 seconds ? <br />
As a healer shaman, I'll trade for that right away.<br />
But maybe you're a Enh Shaman, so I understand your pov, but you missed the fact that most shamans aren't like you.</div></div><hr />

I read that our CM wrote this is not a nerf. However, I still remember the last time we got &quot;we're buffing you&quot; when in fact it was a nerf - reminder, elemental shamans in 2.3 PTR and exactly how long it took developers to realize that it was indeed a nerf to elemenetal dps. So until confirmed, I'm still pessimistic. <br />
<br />
No, I'm not enhancement, I've been resto for a good part of my shaman days - since the release of TBC. Check http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Executus&amp;n=Qrio . From what my guild is currently raiding, I don't think I can get any upgrades. I have yet to see 1 boss fight where you stay still all the time, and you can't find time to fit in 1 cast (you can cast WS while moving). I don't like wasting GCDs, but there is always a chance to recast this. <br />
<br />
The way WS is now is OK, granted if implemented correctly as people in the above thread suggest. However, you have to admit that having 600mana after 1 minute without being hit is better than not having it at all or 5mp5 over the next 10 minutes. <br />
<br />
Edit: Considering Bou posted latest class changes, I take my words back. If it goes live as proposed, it'll be indeed a buff to current version. Gn.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2007-11-22, 12:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The mage changes have me puzzled, Ice Block was made baseline ostensibly because it was needed for PvP but then blizzard go ahead and replace it with another kickass PvP skill which all mages will soon claim they can't live without in PvP and they will still have to spec frost. As a melee character it is already practically impossible to get close to a frost mage and adding lots more chance to be frozen in place only exacerbates the situation.<br />
<br />
So Ice Block becomes baseline because frost mages were outperforming other mages in PvP. I can at least follow the logic of that train of thought (though since both the arcane and fire 41 point talents seem PvP focussed anyway I would argue it was the same 41 point or 21 point talent decision that all classes are forced to make).<br />
<br />
But, when they then go and at the same time buff Cold Snap and add a new powerful PvP focussed talent to the frost tree it makes a joke of the whole operation, you just end up buffing the hell out of frost mages in PvP while giving smaller buffs to the other two specs, it does nothing to redress any supposed imbalance and in fact just skews that imbalance further in favour of the frost mage.</div></div><hr />

Water shield will still give mana when you get it. The difference is now instead to receive 600 mana after the 1 minute, you will get 600 mana over 1 minute (50 mp5)</div></div><hr />

Now, regarding the changes. It is a buff for frost mages in PVP, some of the changes were foreseen - like the switching of CS to previous IB spot.<br />
<br />
Now, the Icy veins is quite interesting... it is low enough to interest pve ppl... It can become choosing between 10% mana (clearcast in arcane) and this temporary haste.<br />

<br />
Wait a sec, nope, I can't, sorry... :P<br />
<br />
Anyway, on the real subject - not about those boring shammies but the sexy and interesting mage class (/jk), what do you think about the changes - it is a clear - across the board - pve and pvp buff. Also it will make fire and deep frost specs perform closer in PVE (much closer than the lessened difference in PVP). There are a couple of speculations that puzzle me:<br />
<br />
-IB trainable: mage survivability with higher damage specs was a clear issue - they were very sensitive to aoe/environmental damage, due to low health and lack of defenses. And TBC fights are filled with those - so mages *are* a liability to an extent that a lock, for example, is not. Trainable IB helps a lot with many of those issues, particular regarding debuffs.<br />
<br />
-Mana gems: mages had been claiming for these to be improved since.. well, since TBC came out - over 10 months ago. It was then clear that the mage mana issues were serious - and structural. Itemization issues regarding spirit didn't make it any better. Now, finally, Blizz recognizes the issue and improves the MG (ok, I'd still like them to have their own separate CD). <br />
<br />
Question... Why now? Did they finally get the data on mana pots usage and mage group pairings? On mage numbers and raid environmental deaths?<br />
<br />
I wonder what type of raiding sunwell will bring, and suspect that the requirements regarding enviromental damage and fight extensions to be upgraded. Maybe fight design were a mage would be hard pressed to survive without IB.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Even without IV there would be no discussion which is the best mage pvp spec, trainable IB or non trianable IB =&gt; Frost. Frost is superior in the current non burst damage pvp environment not only because of IB, far from it. The elemental IS crucial - superior control (ranged FN), separate source of dmg and dmg while in IB, but other talents such as Ice Barrier, frostbite, shatter, all make that frost is much more than IB regarding PVP.<br />
<br />
Now this new talent affects all spells - not only frost but also arcane and fire (at least by the wording of the blue post), so, taking into consideration the buffs to the gems, we may well see the resurface of a slightly elementalist build (2/48/11).<br />
But one question is arising - if IV just affects frost and with the shorter CD on coldsnap (that will also affect IV), frost could become the best spec for PVP and PVE regarding damage. For that to happen, it is just needed that it closes the 5-10% difference it has to fire (IV is calculated in about 2,77% dmg increase) to about 2% or so.. then fire could become dead.<br />
<br />
That would be rather bad, and I think that Blizz should buff combustion into something that pushes mages into the 2k dps club (as of now combustion has a diminishing return - the better your gear, the less useful that 31 pointer becomes) and about 10% above frost specs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
/rolleyes<br />
<br />
<br />
What you talking about man warriors was never powerful. There is a difference between GEARED and GROUP powerful and BASIC powerful abilities.<br />
<br />
If well geared everyone can be powerful. <br />
<br />
Just because you got owned by geared warrior in the past doesn't mean the class as a whole is powerful lol ;)</div></div><hr />
