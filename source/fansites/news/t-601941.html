Item changes in 2.2<br />

Does this mean if you already have flask of shadow fortification. They will be transformed into the flask of pure deaths? Or is this only after the patch has been put into place? Thx to whoever can answer that.</div></div><hr />

I was weirded out about it at first too, but it's rather a good news, more dmg is always a good thing :-)<br />
I do remember reading about this too, so I think it's real (/hope)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's probably because of how often those flasks are being used so they are just abolishing them from the game.</div></div><hr />
