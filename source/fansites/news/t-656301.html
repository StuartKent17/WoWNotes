Scammers using MMO-Champion's name<br />
In the past days a new type of scam appeared in World of Warcraft, and it's not a nice one. Scammers are posing as MMO-Champion and whisp people to tell them that they won a spectral tiger mount or something like that and ask them to claim their prize on a website. This is obviously a fake where the only goal is to steal your account, I felt like I had to warn people about this one since it's using the site's name. <br />
<br />
I think this is the first time a fansite is used in a scam and MMO-Champion is one of the biggest out there, but this might be extended to other fansites as well. Just be careful and remember that you should never give your account name or password to anyone, and never type it on any website someone linked to you, the only place to type your password is on worldofwarcraft.com, wow-europe.com, or battle.net, and only after YOU typed the URL in your web browser. Ultimately, you can just buy an authenticator from the Blizzard Store if you really want to feel safe. <br />

Again, we're not running any contest (and probably never will because I hate having to exclude EU or US people just because of legal concerns on contests) and if someone try to get your login and password in-game report him to a GM as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it has less to do with not thinking about the EU and more to do with balancing legal issues with 1 nation vs a collection of nations. As Boubouille said...making sure that your contest is legal in each and every nation is a logistical nightmare...and then if you DO make it allowed in the nations that don't have laws against those give aways, the people that can't participate still cry foul because they're being discriminated against. Just look at the blue posts from yesterday about the arena tourney realms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is already burned into the Skulls of 99,9% / Playerbase.<br />
<br />
Sadly, scammers getting smart this days and program Webpages with Trojans.<br />
You visit the Page, and boom... you got a Trojan.<br />
<br />
I highly suggest avoiding Weblinks from people in Game you dont know.<br />
And also, install Firefox with the Addon &quot;Addblock Plus&quot;, and disable all the crap no one needs (Java, ActivX etc).<br />
Virii Scanner (Avira AntiVir Personal / freeware) should also be installed and always running in the Background.<br />
AND....GET A BLIZZ AUTHENTIFICATOR, that piece of hardware owns and makes your Acc nearly unhackable ;)<br />
<br />
Take care</div></div><hr />

On WoW.com, they even interviewed the guy. He'd do a WTS for a spectral tiger code, then he'd have you open trade and enter 5000 in the trade window, and cancel, just to confirm you had the money. You cant type out a value you dont actually have. Once he knew that you had over 5000, he'd give you a link and the code (This scam is just sloppy in comparison). He'd have an account management login page ready to do, and the instant you entered in your user/pass/auth, he'd have em entered into the actual Blizzard account page and disable your auth key and change your password. Then he could take his time robbing you.<br />
<br />
But he said he wouldnt vendor your gear, just take your money. Swell guy, eh? Even better was that the numbnuts told everyone how he did it in the interview. Thank goodness for boastful criminals. The old addage still holds true. If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is.</div></div><hr />

i did. it's because on german keyboards they have to hold shift while pressing &quot;1&quot; to type an &quot;!&quot; therefore after many !! there can be an 1...it's used by kiddies and has sadly become a manner to type a real eleven in it...<br />

Or you can use the forgot password link on the login page for your account settings. that will at least get control of the account back. From there, try a free antivirus/antispyware scanner like AVG (http://free.grisoft.com). A lot of trojans wont be picked up by an antivirus, but spyware/malware scanners can pick em up. Thats why its good to use a scanner that will check for both.<br />
<br />
For really persistant ones, you may need to make sure its not launching itself at startup. You can see whats launching at startup by opening a RUN command from the start menu and putting in MSCONFIG. That will show you everything thats launching. Some of the really nasty ones will have a service that launches a randomly named executable, which will relaunch the service if its not running. Fun stuff, eh?</div></div><hr />

How stupid are you people?<br />
<br />
It is not hard to keep your account from being hacked. You really don't need to have a bunch of anti-spyware, anti-virus programs running just to keep your account from being hacked. I guess you do have to have some understanding of how to work your computer but I expect most people who know how to install an addon for wow to know enough. Don't download a bunch of crap to your computer. Don't go to a bunch of sites that clearly try to download stuff to your computer. <br />
<br />
The most likely reason for you to even end up at those types of sites is because your trying to do something illegal(keygens or .iso that you don't have permission to) or look a porn or something. If your gonna do crap like that in the first place you should be expecting something bad to happen. Then having a good anti-virus/spyware program would be smart. Other then that, just don't be stupid. <br />
<br />
Oh, and if your running vista and having problems with things being downloaded without you knowing, stop turning off crap that's there to protect your computer. By default vista/IE7 will notify you 2-3 times before anything you download will run. Even once its running it is highly unlikely that vista won't find a problem with it and notify you before it does damage to your computer. <br />
<br />
If your gonna use a computer please learn something about it first and don't complain after you do something stupid.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I got pst'd with that one too (amongs't a mountain of gold sellers, the pricks). I stared at it incredulously for a moment before psting him (i'm assuming it's a dude 'cause, as we all know, there are no girlz on the interwebz. M.M.O.R.P.G = Many Men Online Role-Playing Girls, after all xD) back and telling him that, even if Blizz was making new mounts, I could either wait for them to go live for try to get on the PTR. Then I lol'd at him with my guildies at the stupidity of it.</div></div><hr />
