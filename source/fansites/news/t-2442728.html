WoW Classic BlizzCon Demo Pre-Download<br />
Hi everyone! We’re incredibly excited for you all to get your hands on the WoW Classic BlizzCon demo next week, and to help make things as smooth as possible, we’re making the client available to download for Virtual Ticket holders starting today.<br />
<br />
Over the next 24 hours, we’ll be enabling the ability to download the WoW Classic demo through the Battle.net app for players who have purchased the BlizzCon Virtual Ticket, as well as standard BlizzCon ticket holders who have added their Virtual Goodies code to their Battle.net account. If you don’t see the option to install the demo right away, don’t worry – you’ll still have plenty of time to download the client before the demo goes live during BlizzCon next week.<br />
<br />
We can’t wait for you to get a peek at what we’ve been working on, and hope you enjoy this preview of what’s to come!</div></div><hr />

There's still some newer content left that they have yet to take out. Will probably be smaller when it actually releases whenever that may be.<br />

I hope they find a way to make the clients share data they'd otherwise duplicate, like sound effects and music, or the very engine itself (given Classic is basically the old game rebuilt almost from the ground up in the new one).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting. IIRC there was an issue with the Icon showing for Overwatch for macs but that was a few BDA builds ago. Not sure if they ever fixed that or what your seeing is a bug regression or not.<br />
<br />
Can you tell me what you are seeing for your versions in the BDA under Blizzard logo -&gt; Settings -&gt; About ?<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Wait, how can you hide Activision games from the launcher? Is there a setting for it?<br />
<br />
No setting but there was a way of modifying the BDA so that entire tab is hidden.<br />
<br />
It was placing a QML file in a special folder that has the visible property for that tab set to hidden. Unfortunately with how the battle.net launcher is designed , every time they push a new build you have to re-apply the mod.<br />
<br />
Not because it was being caught by some integrity check or anything. It's because of how the battle.net client is installed - each build lives inside it's own folder with most if not all it's resources and things inside it (aka Battle.net.xxxx where xxxx is a build number). Each time the battle.net team push out a new build of the BDA the battle.net desktop app / client will load the new build ..... and the modified file is in the old build folder.<br />
<br />
EDIT : Looks like they plugged that way of modifying the BDA. Just tested it myself.</div></div><hr />

It it's so bad, if blizzard is so greedy, why are you still here, spewing venom ? <br />
I don't see the problem with the current live, there are things to do but you're not forced to play 8h/day 7/7 and thats better.<br />

40€ for some goodies (I play D3 too) and the ticket. The demo is a bonus and we all KNEW that was a demo with 2 zones and a few level, I'm not surprised at all. <br />
<br />
The time limitation will be there if there are too many people and will probably be lifted after blizzcon is over (for the remaining 2 days of demo)<br />

B*tch please, it takes weeks (yes, weeks) to level up to 60 in vanilla/classic.<br />

Ehm, they have rebuilt the game from the ground up (code wise) in the new engine. Added features like colorblind etc, so it works on new OS, 64 bit etc.<br />
So yeah they have been working on it. Not just copied the 1.12 patch, like all the private servers out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if you think leveling is terrible now, it's waaaay worse in Classic. And yes, I agree that after the nerfs to heirlooms and scaling or whatever they F'd up in 7.3.5 leveling is way worse than it was BEFORE, but it still pales in comparison to Classic. <br />
<br />
In Classic, you could do every single quest in all the zones for your faction and STILL have to grind along the way by just killing mobs over and over again. I remember getting to like 56 or 57 and just having to kill mobs in Silithus until I dinged 60 finally. Get ready for tedium in that regard, though that's arguably the experience.<br />
<br />
The speed of leveling is why I'll probably only get one character to 60 in Classic. I'm much older now and I don't have time to devote to getting more than one toon to 60 at the slower rate.</div></div><hr />

Really depends on who you ask. For me Vanilla leveling was engaging moreso because A) it was my first MMORPG and B) you had to read and look for things and I visited things like thottbot when I was truly stuck lol. Nowadays it's autoaccept everything go to marker on map and done. It was way slower just numbers wise yes but nothing will ever be that slow again on live.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think the best speed you could level to 60 was around 20 days, using addons that guided you, and they had a lot of &quot;Stay in this zone, kill mobs until leveling&quot; in them. WoW and &quot;efficiency&quot; were not a thing back then, they made a lot of the changes over the years to streamline and fix the warts of Classic. The best way to do it was with a friend, or friends in dungeons, the game wasn't really focused on solo activity, they expected you to do things with other people. I don't remember it, but there were group bonuses to experience back then. <br />
<br />
That's why some people knew their classes pretty well, because of how long it took to level, you had to put some time in, and you weren't one shotting everything at 60, the way you are now. There were places in the map that even at 60 the mobs were a problem, and you needed raid level gear to farm easily. I remember farming in the area that's the DK starting zone now, and the mobs were still a challenge at 60 with MC gear. (In before the elitist starts sneering how he killed those mobs back then blindfolded and with a broken mouse)</div></div><hr />

What does that have to do with people complaining that its &quot;40 bucks for a demo&quot;?? When its 40 bucks for a virtual ticket to see blizzcon and it includes access to a demo.<br />
<br />
You know exactly what you are buying, either buy the ticket and enjoy the show and perks or don't. Not sure what the debate is here.</div></div><hr />

Have you leveled since 7.3.5? Nobody is one-shotting anything. You sound completely out of touch.</div></div><hr />

It it's so bad, if blizzard is so greedy, why are you still here, spewing venom ? <br />
I don't see the problem with the current live, there are things to do but you're not forced to play 8h/day 7/7 and thats better.<br />
<br />
And yes I have the VT and I'll try the demo<br />

I didnt criticize Live at all. I love live. The game has never been more fun. Wanna try that again? Reading is painful for some, I understand.</div></div><hr />
