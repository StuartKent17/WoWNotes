Warlords of Draenor - Ironhoof Destroyer Mount<br />
The Ironhoof Destroyer (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116660-ironhoof-destroyer) will drop from Blackhand in Mythic Blackrock Foundry. It is the only Warlords of Draenor mount that drops from a raid instance so far.<br />

Upcoming Class Tuning Changes<br />
Giving everyone a heads up on class balance changes that could potentially take effect as early as later tonight. Many of these changes may not be reflected in tooltips.<br />
<br />
These changes are primarily aimed at level 100 balance, but they will have reasonable effects in the meantime as well. Please keep the comments constructive, and we expect to be making a few additional tuning changes in the future.<br />

Whirlwind (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/1680)’s damage has been reduced by 30%.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think this is a misspeling, you guys buffed this crap right? 2k damage for a 2s cast get reduced?<br />
This change undid the buff to Frostbolt back on October 17. The net change is zero.<br />
<br />
So you're saying the tuning team really don't have a clue what they're doing?<br />
Or, we made a change and undid it because it isn't working out. Note that the tuning is primarily intended for level 100.<br />
<br />
<br />
Upcoming Honor Changes<br />
Wanted to give a heads-up that there's a hotfix being worked on (no ETA but soon without the TM) to increase the amount of Honor gains for Arathi Basin, Deepwind Gorge, Eye of the Storm, and The Battle for Gilneas. We're changing it so Honor is awarded for every 150 resources gathered (up from Honor awarding for every 250 resources gathered).<br />
<br />
<br />
Characters of Warcraft Updated: Velen and Khadgar<br />
The Lore section of our game guide has been updated with two new entries on the Characters of Warcraft page (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/characters/): Velen (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/characters/velen) and Khadgar (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/characters/khadgar)!<br />
<br />
Velen is a staunch defender of the Draenei, and has guided his people in the struggle against the Burning Legion for thousands of years. Now he’s facing a much more immediate threat – the Iron Horde.<br />
<br />
Khadgar saw the Iron Horde’s intentions for Azeroth when Nethergarde Keep fell. Now he is determined to stop their assault before it’s too late, and is leading the charge into the Dark Portal, as he did in the past.<br />
<br />
Their fates intertwined, Velen and Khadgar are willing to sacrifice much to ensure the safety of their people. Can they triumph over the Iron Horde? Or will they fall to a foe more dangerous than any they’ve encountered before?<br />
<br />
We invite you to learn more about these characters and the pivotal role they play in Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
To learn more about the leaders of the Iron Horde, check out the Lords of War video series (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/savage-world/lords-of-war/).<br />

Warriors are right now top in the dps table. What are you on about? If Blizz has traditionally shown any bias against two classes it has been hunters and dks, they never really knew what to do with either, and this was clearly stated time ago by GhostCrawler regarding dks.</div></div><hr />

Hunters? Dk? Cry me a river. I wished shadow was in their shape just ONCE in a lifetime. They can solo, they do massive dps and they work well in pvp even on their own. And all of that at the same time. Shadow can't do any of that since BC.</div></div><hr />

In most fantasy, you cannot cast large spells while running. YOu guys are turrets, and still very dangerous. I think most panic when they get a melee on them, because they are not used to having a melee actually be difficult to kite, you'll get used to it.</div></div><hr />

Demonology has always been crap. The only time it was good was in Pandaria but completely killed off to absolute nothingness in patch 5.4. While Destruction was a powerful alternative, at the moment and even at 100 it's painfully boring to me personally. Looks like this expansion will be rather short for me and thankfully straight to the point by Blizzard for a much appreciated change. Oh and Affliction will forever be a secretary spec where you can't solo anything.<br />

WoW has two varieties(PvE and PvP) for a reason. PvP zones, rewards, Battlegrounds, Arenas and so on are added to the game and constantly updated with new ones to encourage the PvP community to continue playing. If it was only a PvE game these new additions wouldn't come to be nor will the rewards continue to update either just as they do for PvE players. <br />

<br />
You have to understand one thing, We are (warrior) top atm because all the tuning that was done is meant to take effect @ 100. They really don't give a crap about 90 content and this result in Warrior being top. However, @100 warriors weren't top and we just took a massive hit of nerfbat to the face. I'd understand the nerf if we were top be we aren't. They are making blind changes w/o thinking. We lost Heroic strike, Colossus smash.. Yes I will bring this back because some people don't seem to understand how impactful these change were. Yet most warriors got over it, but now, they nerf even more stuff... They nerf a talent (Slam) that no one ever pick because it is trash in the first place. If they would monitor numbers they would see that NO high end raider ever use Slam talent. That being said as of right now Arms is complete garbage @100, fury is almost as bad and gladiator is somewhat decent/good. This make me feel/think they just wanna push warrior to play Gladiator cause its their &quot;New&quot; thing. Either way I don't like it and I really hope Celestalon and his team open their eyes and start monitoring numbers and fix the real warrior problems. Same goes to the other class. They wanna make it so every class is on an even ground fine, maybe they should take a look @ the WW Monk numbers which are top by quite a lot @ level 100.<br />

Very wishful thinking! I love my lock had it since vanilla but we have had our time in the sun.

Pet damage makes up a massive portion of BM's damage (much more than KC does), so nerfing it by 15% has a greater net effect than buffing KC by 20%. Keep on trying to be combative about posts that have no bearing on you though, I DEFINITELY don't smell a troll!</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Warforged Horse from the Blizzard Store would have been perfect for a Blacksmith mount though.<br />
<br />
Uh I dunno. I was just thinking it was different from the usual mounts that Engineers make (Sky Golem, Motorcycles, Rockets, etc). <br />
<br />
Nah the Warforged Horse looks more like a spirit encased in a metal body. Something enchanting would be able to do.</div></div><hr />

Boost to dmg of DKs? Did they know they already crit for 30k?<br />
<br />
25-30% increase dmg to boomkin? Good kin already tops BG dmg every time.<br />
<br />
Even more nerf to hunters? Wow, just wow..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's see some rare mounts drop from pvp insignia loot (lol)</div></div><hr />

<br />
First of all, they won't.<br />
<br />
Second of all, get over yourself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you think the games been shit since Wrath launched then? Yet you've still been playing and paying all that time? *cough*</div></div><hr />

Stormstrike and Lash hit like a freaking noodle.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tazr</div><div class="date">2014-11-04, 05:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Once again Blizz has designed (this time, a mount) with an utter disregard for potential abuse by trolls. This mount is too huge to be practical. It doesn't even offer vendors or passenger seats in an attempt to justify its over-the-top scale. <br />
<br />
This mount exists for no real purpose other than harassment disguised as bragging rights. Given how/where it drops, people will be parked on it in major cities, showing it off as if it somehow makes them important. Be prepared to &quot;enjoy&quot; the experience of having this ugly thing blocking mailboxes and quest givers - even standing on top of the gifts under the Christmas tree.....</div></div><hr />
