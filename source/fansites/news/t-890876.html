In patch 4.1 we'll be introducing the Guild Finder, a new system designed to enable easier and faster guild recruitment. Guild leaders and players who are looking for a guild to call home will use the Guild Finder to meet one another and begin communications that can lead to a prosperous membership.<br />
<br />
The Guild Finder is intended to act as an in-game bulletin board for guilds that are actively recruiting. Previously in World of Warcraft, your options were limited. You would have to publicly post on your realm forum message board, or speak to other players directly via private messages or the chat channels. That can be a time consuming process. Guild Finder will allow your “looking for new members” message to work 24 hours a day, accessible to all of the characters in your faction, from anywhere in the game.<br />
<br />
A new Guild Finder button will now appear on your Micro Menu if you're either a guild leader or currently unguilded.<br />
<br />
As a guild leader, you will indicate one or more of the common guild interests (such as PvP, Raids, or Role Playing), a general time of the week availability you’re looking for (Weekdays or Weekends), and which class roles you seek from new members (Tank, Healer, Damage). The Comment field is where you can say anything you like about your guild and/or the sort of members you seek. Do you only accept female orcs? Is your guild slowly transitioning from 10-person to 25-person raiding? Perhaps you’ll only accept new members who are available to play on Thursdays at noon? This is the place to say so, and help potential recruits determine whether your guild is what they’re looking for.<br />
<br />
From the perspective of an unguilded player, the Guild Finder allows you to browse through a list of the guilds currently looking for new members. Just launch the Guild Finder, tell it about your availability, class role, and the sorts of guild activities you’re looking for, and then click “Browse Guilds.” This will take you to the second tab, where you’ll see a list of recruiting guilds that fit your profile. Here you can read about them, and if you like what you see, submit a request to join.<br />
<br />
Requests submitted to recruiting guilds appear in the Requests tab. From this third tab, guild leaders can examine potential recruits and proceed with the final steps toward new membership.<br />
<br />
Whether you’re a guild leader looking to fill your ranks or a player looking for a guild that meets your strictest requirements, the Guild Finder provides an easy way to make new friends!<br />

Heroic Nefarian down? Want to work for Blizzard?<br />
You have Heroic Nefarian on farm, Cho'gall is a two-headed joke, Al'Akir is a bag of hot wind, and you have detailed documents on how all of these encounters could have been improved. If you're looking for the next great challenge, have you ever though about working for Blizzard?<br />
<br />
We have Quality Assurance (QA) positions open and we're specifically looking for those with high-end raiding experience to join our teams, test future content, and provide feedback on Heroic raids, class balance, and general game experiences.<br />
<br />
http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/posting.html?id=100008C<br />
<br />
Only full-time positions at our headquarters in Irvine, California are available, so if you're serious about applying be aware that no telecommuting is possible for employment. But with the Blizzard campus offering an on-site cafeteria, library, volleyball and basketball courts, gym, multiple arcades, and movie theater, (not to mention we're 30 minutes from the beach) why would you want to?<br />
<br />
Good luck!<br />

Actually the post is pretty misleading, when you read the application, not only is it individual but you need to talk about your experience with something other then a Blizzard game...</div></div><hr />

My thoughts exactly. In that art he actually looks like an Orc and not like an Ogre with brain damage. And like many have already said, that mural is awesome!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not level 20, it's level 1 with 20 archievement points. Following your logic, the guild with 308 members would be level 140 and the one below would be level 200.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In what way? Quality Assurance has no impact on designing. They simply say what the encounter is like, and the developers decide what to do.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. I think being denied access to TB for days, weeks, or even months at a time because you have unlucky RNG doesn't make for &quot;Hardcore&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I just covered the trilogy less then a month ago so a lot is fresh in my mind, the third tier is a bit confusing as I don't understand why both alli and villan would be displayed like that. Azshara is a given, and the far left is too druidic to be anyone besides Malfurion, so I'm going with what you said. I was a little surprised Deathwing / Demonsoul was not included too.<br />
<br />
The beginning and end gets a little sidetracked doesn't it though? I mean if the focus is of the War trilogy then the four elemental lords are out of place? As well at the end with - I would have never guessed - Dath'remar, that's out of place too right? Oh what do I care, its freaking awesome all the same.</div></div><hr />

If the Old God is intended to be a specific one, it's probably N'zoth. And that might be Azshara instead of Vashj, given Azshara's importance to naga.</div></div><hr />

I can't ask an officer to change something in the form while I'm not online. I still have to post in chat channels cause of the fact that 90% of our recruits for the last months were people from &quot;invite-as-much-as-possible&quot; guilds. And I don't expect this situation to change soon.<br />

<br />
First Part: (from left to right): Therazane the Stonemother, Ragnaros the Firelord, Neptulon the Tidehunter and Al'Akir the Windlord. it displays the ancient times were the Old Gods ruled the world.<br />
<br />
Second Part: to the sides stands what is supposed to be titans, that recreates Azeroth after they have imprisoned the Old Gods. they also create the big waterpool in the middle, also known as The Well of Eternity.<br />
<br />
Third Part: Queen Azshara in her Night Elf form in the middle, with her nightelf servants around her, likely her handmaidens to the right, and Highborne to the left. in the front of her lies her city, the night elves capital in War of the Ancients, named Zin-Azshari. she probaly also looks at the Well of Eternity over it.<br />
<br />
Fourth Part: the last and final battle in War of the Ancients. the orc is Brox with his magical ax, the water beneath them are the Well of Eternity, the hand is Sargeras hand that tries to get out of a portal, and the mage is likely Rhonin, but could be Krasus. however, Krasus was riding on Alextrasa, and since the dragon dont look much more special than an ordinary dragon, its unlikely.<br />
<br />
Fifth Part: the naga-looking thing is Azshara, under the waters of the Well of Eternity. to the right is Illidan putting water from the Well of Eternity down in a lake atop of Mount Hyjal, intending to make its as a new well, but gets stopped before it can be fully finished. the left is the Highborne, now the high elves, sailed to Eastern Kingdoms, and have settled down in &quot;Quel-Thalas&quot;. the High Elf is holding another vial from the Well of Eternity, also from Illidan. he made 7 of those. <br />
in the middle stands the dragons, who make Nordrassil, the world tree, atop of the new Well of Eternity to hold back its energies. Norzdormu, Alextrasa and Ysera, while making the tree, also gives the night elves some blessings through it. the two silohoutes(spelling?) that stands at the tree is Malfurion Stormrage and Tyrande Whisperwind.</div></div><hr />

dont think its specific. in the story, its just the Old Gods overall that tries to use the portal to free themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second Part: to the sides stands what is supposed to be titans, that recreates Azeroth after they have imprisoned the Old Gods. they also create the big waterpool in the middle, also known as The Well of Eternity.<br />
<br />
Third Part: Queen Azshara in her Night Elf form in the middle, with her nightelf servants around her, likely her handmaidens to the right, and Highborne to the left. in the front of her lies her city, the night elves capital in War of the Ancients, named Zin-Azshari. she probaly also looks at the Well of Eternity over it.<br />
<br />
Fourth Part: the last and final battle in War of the Ancients. the orc is Brox with his magical ax, the water beneath them are the Well of Eternity, the hand is Sargeras hand that tries to get out of a portal, and the mage is likely Rhonin, but could be Krasus. however, Krasus was riding on Alextrasa, and since the dragon dont look much more special than an ordinary dragon, its unlikely.<br />
<br />
Fifth Part: the naga-looking thing is Azshara, under the waters of the Well of Eternity. to the right is Illidan putting water from the Well of Eternity down in a lake atop of Mount Hyjal, intending to make its as a new well, but gets stopped before it can be fully finished. the left is the Highborne, now the high elves, sailed to Eastern Kingdoms, and have settled down in &quot;Quel-Thalas&quot;. the High Elf is holding another vial from the Well of Eternity, also from Illidan. he made 7 of those. <br />
in the middle stands the dragons, who make Nordrassil, the world tree, atop of the new Well of Eternity to hold back its energies. Norzdormu, Alextrasa and Ysera, while making the tree, also gives the night elves some blessings through it. the two silohoutes(spelling?) that stands at the tree is Malfurion Stormrage and Tyrande Whisperwind.<br />
<br />
First I thought it was Thunderaan, not Al'akir at the top. Thunderfury must have been passed on.</div></div><hr />

Also, on a side-note, are you limited to how many guilds you can apply for, and do GMs know if yuo have applied for another guild? As otherwise I suspect pople will just spam request as many guilds as they can for membership, and do so regularly in the vague hopes they will get accepted.</div></div><hr />

No, they are not. Algalon is just a raidboss without any decent lore. Also, he wasn't involved in the World of the Ancients. If the stars actually represented him, the art would have been ruined.</div></div><hr />

The guild finder is a joke imo, I mean what person trying to run a decent raiding guild would use it..

Except that game testing isn't nearly as fun as it sounds on paper.<br />
<br />
They're not just giving you a finished Deathwing raid and saying &quot;here, play with this before anyone else gets a chance to, and let us know what you think.&quot;<br />
<br />
Instead, you're going to be testing every little piece of the encounter, over and over and over again. There's going to be tons of bugs. You'll be starting at models without any textures, it won't even look like a raid environment. Most of the time you won't even be trying to &quot;beat&quot; the boss, you'll be testing to break the encounter. You'll get a check list of every conceivable skill and on-use item and be told to try them one by one and see what happens. Etc etc.<br />
<br />
By the time the raid tier is released and everyone is chomping at the bit to start progressing, you'll be so sick of it that you'll never want to see or hear about it ever again. And then they'll give you the next project to start testing....<br />
<br />

You don't want it anyway. It's a bitch job, they want you to work odd and long hours, you're not salaried, no relocation available, specifically targeted toward entry level and hourly wage and absolutely positively no mention of ANY experience or degree requirements. <br />
<br />
Trust me, that wonderful campus that's touted in the forum posting about the position is something you won't get to take advantage of.

<br />
No no. It's how well the DESIGN works. Not the textures. The way the ideas flow together perfectly throughout the whole thing. It is simplistic. The point being, it's the best simplicity I've ever seen depicting the game. The other works are good examples of good-looking art, but they don't express ideas. The mural lays out the whole WC storyline very eloquently. I've never seen anything else do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
and frankly, I think Blizzard needs to make a bid on the person who designed it ASAP to be on their art team.<br />

As it currently is known, she looks more night elf with the lower body of a squid.</div></div><hr />

Just because it's a little different doesn't make it any better then the other artwork posted.<br />
<br />
The guild finder is a joke imo, I mean what person trying to run a decent raiding guild would use it.. To me the only thing it will separate is the shit from the good guild as all the shitty guilds will put ads on it while good guilds will continue to force forum applications on guild websites that nobody ever uses (so in other words waste of internet forums)<br />
<br />
It's not being a downer because it's not like you're pointing out some fact about murals that we don't already know. It's just your opinion.<br />
<br />
The point of murals, as can be seen by looking at anything ever categorized as a mural or wall painting, is to tell a story with art. It's not about how many layers or special effects or how many programs you used to airbrush your photoshop creation. <br />
<br />
You can easily tell that, even while being simple in terms of when you look at it you can see solid colors (because that's normally what people think), it has a very deep meaning. And that's the point of it. When I look at I don't think, 'that's a blood elf' or something equally basic and plain, I think about what each section means, the story it's telling, and I think back and remember the WoW lore I've read about and the things that have been shown in the game. The simplicity of the lines is what throws the average person off, I think. The thick, bold lines and prominent colors say 'simple' to a person who is so used to expecting every pixel in an image to be at least 1920x1080 in resolution and glistening with the latest special effects.<br />
<br />
Art is as much about the meaning of the image as the image itself. Idk, imo, the other pictures are excruciatingly basic and plain. <br />
Blood elf. Gun. k<br />
Chick. Swords. k<br />
Troll. k<br />
Wolf. Sword. k<br />
<br />
But, it's all in the eye of the beholder. I still don't see the point of a picture with a face with the features in all the wrong places. lol<br />
<br />
The mural is beautiful, in style and in meaning, to me.</div></div><hr />

They have quite a few stunning Warcraft pieces, among other fandom artworks. You won't regret checking them out. As mentioned before, they do have a print of the mural available . I plan on getting a block print.<br />
