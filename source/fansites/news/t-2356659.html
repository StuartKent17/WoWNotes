<br />
Unholy<br />
<br />
Dreadwake Armor 4-piece set bonus can now proc from its own bonus Death Coil. Proc chance reduced to 16% (was 20%).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: This fix addresses a bug that prevented the bonus from activating as often as intended, and should average a small increase in throughput for the Unholy 4-piece.<br />

Golganneth's Vitality should no longer break stealth when it procs.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
What is the reason of the Antorus restriction for the Pantheon secondary proc ?<br />
A mix of theming—the power of the Pantheon looms over Antorus—and worry that the trinkets could force awkwardly specific dungeon compositions for high-end Mythic Keystone dungeons. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/940655045481152512))<br />
<br />
After the release of patch 7.3.5 will the appearances of the artifacts be obtainable for characters who have just climbed to the maximum level?<br />
Nothing is changing about artifact appearances in 7.3.5. After the Battle for Azeroth launches, you can earn all appearances except the Mage Tower weapon and Mythic Keystone 15 variant. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/940654728031059968))<br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Midnight Launch<br />
The midnight launch event for the third expansion of the game was celebrated around the world. A short clip put together by blizzard shows fans from all over Europe, as North America. The launch event featured live music, cosplayers, and lots of WoW fans.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Subraces in WoW<br />
In 2013 Shoc put together quite a few subrace mockups and shared them on the forums. This Fan Art was received very well by the community, and caught the attention of the Art Director, Chris Robinson. Several years later, Allied Races were announced and they are expected to be added to the game in the near future.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
World of Warcraft Global Offensive<br />
Ivan Kuzkin released another WoW Machinima, this time combining the popular FPS game Counter-Strike: Global Offensive with World of Warcraft characters. The video featured the famous Dust II map, as the Alliance faction played the role of the Counter-Terrorists, and the Horde playing the role of the Terrorists.<br />

Yeah. People got seriously bamboozled by this stuff. Net neutrality is as neutral as the patriot act is patriotic. <br />

This has been well known for ages now... &quot;apparently&quot; something similar happened but there was no recording so they &quot;reenacted&quot; the situation a few times until they got what they wanted.. the rest history.</div></div><hr />

Sorry to burst your bubble, but there are clearly indications in the video. One if them not knowing how divine intervention from paladins works. Another is how the guy filming is running around clicking extra eggs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus someone &quot;calculates&quot; their chance to succeed and comes up with the answer 34%. There is no way to actually do a number crunch on the odds of beating an encounter.</div></div><hr />

It was obvious, wan't it? Their &quot;strategy&quot; is a load of bollocks, number crunch is a joke and they are not even trying to fight, just agroing things.<br />

Yep, they confuse concept of net neutrality, which is something everyone should be for, with law that has nothing to do with net neutrality except title. Guess many (unfortunately too many) Americans can't read more than titles.</div></div><hr />

You realize the state of ISP/cable company having their own &quot;boundaries&quot; and areas where they can operate is the result of government regulation don't you? <br />
<br />
Also its a monopolistic or oligopoly market. And oh... if you are a supporter of patients you aren't a supporter of free open markets as they create government created monopolies.</div></div><hr />

That's the thing though - that law had nothing to do with any of it. You might want to read what its about rather than reading title. It was about censorship, not about ISP speeds. It was about giving FCC ability to silence anyone government disagrees with, without any trial.<br />
<br />
Netflix made fuss about speeds when they didn't get special treatment, not because they were discriminated. They wanted Comcast to house their servers for free, then when Comcast refused to give Netflix special treatment, Netflix started smearing campaign.<br />
<br />
Sheeps bought &quot;net neutrality&quot; bullshit because they can't read beyond clickbait titles.<br />
<br />
Net neutrality was power grab from Obama. That's all it was. Proper net neutrality law would be a good thing, but Obama's clickbait law isn't it.<br />

<br />
The dude writes with an almost total lack of definite articles- &quot;Netflix made fuss&quot; rather than &quot;Netflix made a fuss&quot;, &quot;Net neutrality was power grab&quot; rather than &quot;Net neutrality was a power grab&quot;, &quot;It was about giving FCC ability&quot; rather than &quot;It was about giving the FCC the ability&quot; etc etc. Either his English is poor, or he's a second language English speaker. His speech patterns are certainly indicative of Eastern European/Russian origin given the lack of articles in the majority of Slavic languages. <br />
<br />
While that doesn't disqualify him from commenting, it does mean he has no skin in the game and so can happily troll from the sidelines without worrying about how the death of NN will actually impact him. Watching a bunch of Youtube vids linked on Alt-right message boards is always going to give you a warped view of an issue.</div></div><hr />

Everytime I see the word sheep used I know for a fact they are spouting bullshit without any knowledge, You cry about lefties and Obama because you need a boogeyman, you need that person to be afraid of because thats what modern media (Majority right wing media) pushes. They are going to steal your guns, they are going to steal your house, they are going to steal your rights. All the while they are the ones reaching in your pocket.</div></div><hr />

Leeroy is symbolic for big businesses transmitting their content first and faster than everyone else.<br />

<br />
Everytime I see the word sheep used I know for a fact they are spouting bullshit without any knowledge, You cry about lefties and Obama because you need a boogeyman, you need that person to be afraid of because thats what modern media (Majority right wing media) pushes. They are going to steal your guns, they are going to steal your house, they are going to steal your rights. All the while they are the ones reaching in your pocket.<br />
You are still missing the point. Net neutrality as concept is great thing, nobody sane would argue against it. Timeline you linked to has nothing in common with net neutrality law.<br />
<br />
However net neutrality law is a different thing. It has strings attached to it that have nothing to do with net neutrality that allow FCC to censor anyone.<br />
<br />
That's why I call people who support net neutrality law a sheep - they don't read anything other than headlines. Read what net neutrality law is actually about and don't confuse it with net neutrality as concept. Net neutrality concept = good. Net neutrality law = bad because its nothing like concept.<br />
<br />
<br />
The dude writes with an almost total lack of definite articles- &quot;Netflix made fuss&quot; rather than &quot;Netflix made a fuss&quot;, &quot;Net neutrality was power grab&quot; rather than &quot;Net neutrality was a power grab&quot;, &quot;It was about giving FCC ability&quot; rather than &quot;It was about giving the FCC the ability&quot; etc etc. Either his English is poor, or he's a second language English speaker. His speech patterns are certainly indicative of Eastern European/Russian origin given the lack of articles in the majority of Slavic languages. <br />
<br />
While that doesn't disqualify him from commenting, it does mean he has no skin in the game and so can happily troll from the sidelines without worrying about how the death of NN will actually impact him. Watching a bunch of Youtube vids linked on Alt-right message boards is always going to give you a warped view of an issue.<br />
Yes, you are right. English is my third language, I don't live in US and have no skin in game. That makes me less biased than brainwashed partisan drones. I don't care about left/right, I don't care about democrats/republicans, those are all meaningless concepts to me and I think both sides are equally stupid. I'm not a moron who thinks in binary left/right mode.<br />
<br />
That's why I don't jump on pro-neutrality bandwagon and prefer to figure out what its actually about, unlike millions of idiots who just follow their party's line.<br />

US (as well as any other country's) politics have no place on MMO site.</div></div><hr />

Let me guess, you saw a funny yet informative video from a late-night talk show paid for be corporations and mega-monopolies designed to convince you that the other monopolies were the bad guys, is that right? Let's educate you all on something.<br />
<br />
First of all, ISPs are ALREADY ALLOWED to bundle/throttle websites right now, just as long as they don't claim to be neutral. It's literally already been like that according to the FCC's own 'net neutrality' rules put in place awhile back.<br />

<br />
But seriously, why not just read the whole statement by Ajit Pai himself first?<br />
<br />
http://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1128/DOC-347980A1.pdf<br />
<br />
And further, here are some assurances given by the FCC:<br />
<br />
https://transition.fcc.gov/Daily_Releases/Daily_Business/2017/db1122/DOC-347927A1.pdf<br />
<br />
<br />
Specifically, here, on page 83:<br />
<br />
Many of the largest ISPs (Comcast, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Cox, Frontier, etc.) have committed in this proceeding not to block or throttle legal content. 507 These commitments can be enforced by the FTC under Section 5, protecting consumers without imposing public-utility regulation on ISPs.508<br />
<br />
On page 82:<br />
<br />
The FTC’s unfair-and-deceptive-practices authority “prohibits companies from selling consumers one product or service but providing them something different,” which makes voluntary commitments enforceable. 502 The FTC also requires the “disclose [of] material information if not disclosing it would mislead the consumer,” so if an ISP “failed to disclose blocking, throttling, or other practices that would matter to a reasonable consumer, the FTC’s deception authority would apply.”<br />
<br />
And by the way, in case you didn't know, we have a little thing called ANTITRUST LAWS:<br />
<br />
<br />
Section 1 of the Sherman Act bars contracts, combinations, or conspiracies in restraint of trade, making anticompetitive arrangements illegal. If ISPs reached agreements to [U]unfairly block, throttle, or discriminate against Internet conduct or applications, these agreements would be per seillegal under the antitrust laws.<br />
<br />
So put down your goddamn pitchforks and stop acting like the fucking world is ending every fucking day. Seriously, grow the fuck up.<br />

Your post is so full of egregious lies and half truths it's difficult to know where to start, and it's Christmas so I don't really want to waste time with your BS, but I'll point out 3 things:<br />
1) The document you highlighted as some kind of evidence refers to ISPs who explicitly present themselves as restricting content. E.g. I am an ISP that doesn't allow any access to porn sites because we only offer a family friendly service. Curated is not the same as throttled, unless you're expecting that ISPS after the death of NN will explicitly say &quot;If you sign up to us, you won't have access to Netflix or Facebook&quot;.<br />
2) If your best bet is 'ISPs have given an undertaking that they won't throttle traffic' you're either gullible or dumb. Ask yourself this question - if ISPs have no intention of throttling traffic, why have they spent hundreds of millions lobbying to revoke chapter 2 status? You don't spend millions on something if you don't plan on sneakily introducing it once the public's gaze is elsewhere.<br />
3) The biggest and stupidest lie in your post is the 'muh, Obama appointed Pai' BS. Pai's post on the FCC was a Republican seat- Obama didn't choose Pai, he was chosen by Mitch McConnell, who gave his name to Obama, who in turn nominated him. That's how nominations work when you have seats allocated for different parties - suggesting that Pai is somehow Obama's homey is total garbage - he's a Republican shill.<br />
<br />
But yeah, you go ahead and convince yourself that multinational corporations have our best interests at heart because they tell us they do - that's always worked in the past, and no corporation has ever screwed over a member of the public in pursuit of profit, right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Learn to read. &quot;It would also be true of an ISP that engages in other forms of editorial intervention, such as throttling of certain applications chosen by the ISP, or filtering of content into fast (and slow) lanes based on the ISP's commercial interests.&quot;<br />
<br />
2) I assume you meant Title II, not &quot;chapter 2&quot; (whose calling who dumb, again?). Title II is a piece of shit. On pg 43 of the Communications Act of 1934 (https://transition.fcc.gov/Reports/1934new.pdf), it states:<br />
<br />
<br />
SEC. 214. [47 U.S.C. 214] EXTENSION OF LINES.<br />
<br />
(a) No carrier shall undertake the construction of a new line or of an extension of any line, or shall acquire or operate any line, or extension thereof, or shall engage in transmission over or by means of such additional or extended line, unless and until there shall first have been obtained from the Commission a certificate that the present or future public convenience and necessity require or will require the construction, or operation, or construction and operation, of such additional or extended line ... <br />
<br />
Yes. Because that's just what we need, to kill competition and create a literal monopoly for the same companies you so despise that want this revoked. You sure are a smart one, huh?<br />
<br />
3) The fact you fell for the bait of my final point shows you really are a gullible one considering the point of it was to mock the &quot;&quot;&quot;logic&quot;&quot;&quot; of some of you people for automagically branding someone as evil because there's an R next to their name or something or whatever your logic is, who knows anymore.<br />
<br />
Either way, if you don't understand how data is transmitted or how bandwidth shaping is used then you aren't exactly allowed to have an opinion in the first place. This is just to let you (and others) know your opinion is stupid and doesn't matter. Reading some sensationalist article from the corporate media doesn't mean you have an opinion, it means you're stupid. Because hint: all those sensationalist claims you all have been making are something that ANTITRUST LAWS would deal with should they actually happen (y'all actually think they're going to start putting the net into little packages like Portugal has? LMAO. PORTUGAL DOESN'T HAVE ANTITRUST LAWS.<br />
<br />
Anyways, bandwidth shaping is already in place, it always has been, and it's a complex matter that requires lots of computers to sort the data and keep it going right very fast. if we didn't have bandwidth shaping the internet would be a fraction of the speed it is today because data would not be prioritized in an efficient way to make optimum use of data transmission speeds through-out the internet.<br />
<br />
The best visual aid I can think of is that if the internet was a 6 lane highway, you have everyone driving regular cars, businesses driving semi trucks, and media corporations driving a barge with wheels on it that takes up 3 or 4 lanes at a time. There are enough of these barges to make up about 80% of all internet traffic.<br />
<br />
You wind up with network congestion, traffic jams - sub-optimal performance. Planned data shaping means these dudes driving the huge barges get special lanes made that they pay to use so that their massive needs aren't interfering with us and less traffic jams happen. It also allows extra money for network infrastructure upgrades but the bosses will probably just spend the profit on bonuses.<br />
<br />
Sounds really scary right? YouTube and Facebook and porn sites just don't want to pay for all the network they use, which is like 80% of the internet traffic. It wont raise costs for YOU since you aren't using the data. THEY are sending the data to you.<br />
<br />
This is why your download speed is always much faster than your upload speed - because YOU aren't the one sending the traffic through the internet, its whatever site you access.<br />
<br />
So, again, any idiots pretending you are going to have to buy access packages are pretending the real internet is the same as cheapo cellular prepaid plans that do media bundles. Trust me, they will move you away from unlimited broadband long before they start charging you for access packages.<br />
<br />
Final point: The internet wasn't worse 3 years ago before we had it.<br />
If anything there is more censorship now than there was then so &quot;freedom of speech&quot; (or in this case &quot;keep the internet open and free!&quot; is a moot point.<br />
<br />
But hey, you give it a nice shot, but a little advice? Don't give your opinion on things you clearly know nothing about.<br />
<br />
That goes for you and the other ~76% of the population.<br />
