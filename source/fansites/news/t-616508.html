During the past weeks, we mostly focused on raid instances and didn't talk much about Heroic instances. It's time to fix that, in Wrath of the Lich King heroic instances have their own loot table, and now that most (all ?) instances are available in Heroic Mode on beta servers, that's a LOT of items. All these items are ilvl 200 (Same as Naxxramas-10, but rare instead of epic obviously), for the moment we won't sort them by instance because we don't have enough data to do that, but it will eventually happen. <br />
<br />
The list is not complete, but most of the items should be here. I'll probably start working on nice lists of loot for each dungeon very soon, you can stop threatening me in mail because I didn't update some of the lists in a long time or kept them spread over a few posts. (Who said Obsidian Sanctum and Eye of Eternity ?) <br />

I just saw this, a blue DST o.O<br />
<br />
Part of me wants to say awesome, but then the other part of me wants to ask why something so spiffeh drops in a heroic? And then I of course am very optimistic for the trinkets that drop in high-end raids!</div></div><hr />

A couple here and there, but I am seeing a ton of axes, some maces, and very few swords of the two-hander variety. Be it crafted, looted, or quest reward.</div></div><hr />

My bet is they accidentally added Spirit instead of Stamina. They've done it before. It'll probably be corrected soon. ;)</div></div><hr />

It's a good thing that we can stack it earlier but at this rate we're gonna see people over stacking it like how on live right now there's heaps of Warlocks who stack a lot of crit and ignore spell hit. Probably gonna see a repeat of that this time but with Haste instead.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkthunder</div><div class="date">2008-09-28, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With all this delicious gear listed, where are our:<br />
<br />
- Relics<br />
- Librams<br />
- Sigils<br />
- Idols<br />
- Bows<br />
- Crossbows<br />
- Guns<br />
- Thrown<br />
- Shields<br />
<br />
Basically, most of the items that go in either the offhand or &quot;ranged&quot; slots. Also wondering where our &quot;Dungeon Sets&quot; are for this expansion. They had it in the classic WoW as well as TBC.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2008-09-29, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bows / Xbows / Guns / Thrown / Shields are here. <br />
<br />
And keep in mind that.<br />
1. It's a temporary list<br />
2. It's a beta, it wouldn't be surprising if Blizzard wanted to keep some surprise for the release ... That's what I'd do. <br />
<br />
Moved Maiden's Girdle and fixed the color on Red Sword of Courage, Staff of Trickery, and Royal Crest of Lordaeron. 4 errors out of 240 items isn't that bad right ? ^^<br />
<br />
Also, that's something I should probably mention in the main post somewhere but Daelo posted about Greed two weeks ago.<br />
Greed now has Stamina instead of Spirit.</div></div><hr />

Damn thats an assload of spell power. I can't wait till we see the tier 9 trinkets, your spells have a chance to increase spell power by 800 anyone</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said on Wowhead (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=37190#comments): Staff of the Plague Beast (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=39255) (Naxx 10) and Origin of Nightmares (http://wotlk.wowhead.com/?item=40280) (Naxx 25) have both significantly less armor than this one, way to go, Blizz. It's not that we would be much closer to the armor cap in Naxx gear, so wth?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it revered or honored to enter heroic instances?<br />
<br />
Currently on live, it is honored.<br />
<br />
<br />
I do hope they bump it to revered again on Live. Or at least require you to run the specific dungeon at least one time on normal. See it as a way to introduce the player to a dungeon. I don't normally do heroic pugs, but the few I do because of lack of manpower on certain days show that some people don't even know any of the pulls. And LK sounds like it will have more interesting (say: harder) pulls.,</div></div><hr />
