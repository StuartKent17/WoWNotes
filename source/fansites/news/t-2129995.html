Call of the Scarab Micro-Holiday<br />
The Call of the Scarab (http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/638-call-of-the-scarab) holiday event remembers the Gates of Ahn'Qiraj (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Gates_of_Ahn%27Qiraj) world event from Vanilla. This event is an Alliance vs Horde showdown, with the victorious faction flying their faction banner for the next year. <br />
<br />
The Call of the Scarab (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45785-call-of-the-scarab) quest will send you to Silithus so that you know where the vendor and world quests are. From there you can complete quests and defeat bosses to earn Commendations for your faction. Whichever faction has the most Commendations at the end of the event wins. <br />
<br />
Cultist Camps<br />
<br />
There are Twilight Cultist camps scattered around the zone.<br />

Once you have applied all three pieces of the disguise, you can use a Lesser Wind stone to summon a NPC that you can solo. <br />
These drop Abyssal Crest (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143865-abyssal-crest) and remove one of your armor buffs when summoned. <br />

The Twilight Cultist Ring of Lordship (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143866-twilight-cultist-ring-of-lordship) can be used at a Greater Wind Stone to summon a stronger boss that will need a group.<br />

Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl Micro-Holiday<br />
The Kirin Tor Tavern Crawl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/world-events/646-kirin-tor-tavern-crawl) is a micro-holiday that sends players to different taverns around the world. <br />
<br />
<br />
You can join the currently active tavern from a new NPC in Dalaran (Tipsi Wobblerune (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119045-tipsi-wobblerune) or Anebria Sunwine (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/119088-anebria-sunwine))<br />
After some time the group moves along to the next Tavern. You can press the last call button or take the portal to move on.<br />
If you get left behind on the tavern tour, you can catch up by speaking to the mage in the current tavern you are in. <br />
Each location has drink and food that you can interact with. The food will grant a well fed buff.<br />
There are also additional NPCs in each tavern enjoying the holiday.<br />
You can click on the discarded packages to apply one of many unique hat models for four hours. <br />

[Feedback] Marksmanship in 7.1.5<br />
This is further exacerbated in 7.1.5. Patient Sniper no longer provides an increased Focus pool, and Sidewinders generates only 35 Focus. With that in mind, and considering the passive Focus generation of 15 per GCD, Hunters are required to maintain 21.5% Haste in order to generate enough Focus to fire 3 Aimed Shots during Vulnerable. Firing a 3rd Aimed Shot during Vulnerable, especially with the new Patient Sniper design, is a huge DPS increase. 21.5% Haste will essentially be required for MM. This is a hard breakpoint, and should be eliminated before 7.1.5 goes live.<br />
<br />
There's a lot to discuss here--some we agree with and some we don't--but I want to swing by at least on this specific observation. We agree we don't want a major breakpoint between 2 and 3 Aimed Shots after a Marked Shot (at least, not at a middling amount like 21% haste that will affect gear choice throughout the expansion). We're not decided on a fix yet; in particular, whether the standard amount should be two Aimed Shots after a Marked Shot, or three (if two, it would still be okay to have three during Bloodlust and similar situations). The ability would be tuned around whichever option. Two has some advantages like concentrating the Vulnerable burst more, requiring standing still for less time to fully utilize it, and potentially having enough leeway for an instant before one of the Aimed Shots.

Boulderfist Talent<br />
Boulderfist is intended as a talent choice that creates some gaps in your rotation, by replacing your no-cooldown resource builder with something that’s overall stronger, but has charges. In 7.1, the recharge time isn’t long enough for those gaps to ever actually happen, especially with the most popular Enhancement talent build adding several more active abilities to your rotation. Its power level was also simply too high, and in this case, we’d rather let this talent have its intended effect on the pace of your rotation and buff the spec as a whole to compensate. <br />
<br />
Our intent is that if you want to use an ability every GCD, you should choose one of the other options in that row. Boulderfist should result in an overall more methodical pace that is more about having a little time to plan upcoming abilities. When Boulderfist is the hands-down best option in that row, that doesn’t feel like much of a choice, and as we continue tuning for 7.1.5, we hope to address this by bringing it in line with the others. <br />
<br />
While I can appreciate that there was an original design intent behind Boulderfist, the spec as it currently exists on Live is as enjoyable to play as it's ever been since I rolled my Shaman back in BC.<br />
<br />
We've heard it reiterated over and over (and over) again by the developers that if something about a spec felt too mandatory, it would just get rolled into the spec. I play this spec as my main because it is fun; if I cared strictly about maximum overall damage output, I'd focus on my Rogue instead. Changing a mechanic like this runs counter to the design philosophy that's been so oft repeated.<br />
Thanks for all the feedback; this has been a consistent theme throughout the thread and elsewhere. And we don't want to disrupt the familiar playstyle of 7.1 Enhancement, if in fact the specific pacing of Boulderfist's recharge time is a major part of what makes it work so well. We will still have to address the power level in some way without diluting the feel that's been discussed here. We are currently planning the following for PTR (uncertain on timing):<br />
<br />
--Boulderfist recharge time back to 6 seconds<br />
--Boulderfist no longer gives a bonus to critical strike<br />
--Rockbiter generates 20 Maelstrom (from 15) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/788075-enhancement-boulderfist-waiting-for-insight/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20752555084?page=5#89))<br />

Patch 7.1.5 Warlock Changes<br />
Thats all fine and dandy, now get to work fixing warlocks.<br />
Incidentally--Imp/Succubus/Voidwalker/Felhunter/Felguard all deal 20% more damage. Most of that was datamined normally, but in particular, the increase to Felguard's attack power likely was not (simply because it's something that happens server-side).<br />
<br />
I can think of one other thing worth calling attention to for feedback/testing that may have been missed: Mark of the Ancient Priestess and Mark of the Distant Army should do noticeably more healing/damage and be more worth using. Some of the stat-based neck enchants were also increased, but that will be clear in tooltips. Hidden Satyr scales correctly with gear now as well, and may be slightly weaker, but for the most part the other enchants were buffed to roughly its level.

I remember never being able to find reasonable cost mats on the AH during this time as well. Great for top level people, horrific for people still leveling up professions.

In any case, guess I won't be doing this event anyway. The faction imbalance on Frostmourne server is absurd, Horde might be lucky to field 5% of the players Alliance can.</div></div><hr />

Isn't whole event region-wide instead of server wide? I don't know if I remember correctly. Also region wide make more sense, because of faction imbalance on servers and cross realm.</div></div><hr />

I guess it's nice they brought the Sith grind back. I remember doing them back when they first came out - hey, it was something to do in Sith, up until then the zone was unfinished and there was no need to go there.<br />
<br />
I remember the faction race to unlock the gates - the raiders started bitching at the &quot;casuals' in the forums to turn in stuff faster, so THEY could get their raid, which resulted in a boycott on our server. Fun times. I guess. <br />
<br />
It's too bad the best part of AQ is gone for good - the quest for the scepter. Some of the best content ever made for WoW. The grind was insane, tho. But hell, people did Insane In The Membrane, too.</div></div><hr />

Sadly I kind of agree, it doesn't sound like there is much reason for doing them. So the winning faction gets to fly their flag...but does anyone really care? I mean it would be different if it was something fun to do, but I don't think farming mats was ever fun. The pub crawl sounds even more pointless and boring. A food buff and a temporary hat.

Except it's not really the AQ event, it's just a pointless grind with now pointless bosses from something that used to grant loot but has been broken since sometime in TBC I think it was.<br />

This is going to be a handful of people that go do it, realize they get zero from it and don't mess with it for more than 15 minutes probably.<br />

I know for a fact that Charlie Sheen use to play back in TBC, i met him while playing on the PTR. I was on vent with the PTR guild i was in and noticed a voice that sounded very familiar, so i asked him if he was Mr Sheen but he denied it. Next day i logged in i wasn't in the guild anymore, i had been kicked. What an ass, i didn't make a big deal of it, i just asked a simple question if he was who i thought he was and i guess i was right. Back then Mr Sheen played a Warrior Tank.</div></div><hr />

But they have to add some kind of incentive beyond flying your flag in a zone you literally have no reason to go to the rest of the year. A chance at a mount or a pet or something. Timewalker tokens might be appropriate?<br />

Maybe you should listen better, she corrected herself by saying that they might not even be able to be Druids, she only remembers that it was a Druid. She then proceeded to say she re-rolled BE Rogue, which could justify her lack of certainty regarding Alliance content. <br />
Keep in mind the chances are she was a casual WoW player and not a try hard wannabe like 99% of the community nowadays. Pretty sure she was there to enjoy the game with whoever she knew and met in-game and not to be a walking wowwiki.</div></div><hr />

Now even if I ever log back in I will see the flying flag of the enemy faction and remember that my faction is dead, that there's only one or two 10man raiding guilds left and no community whatsoever. <br />
And then I'll go back to Nost again and enjoy a real mmo.</div></div><hr />

While you're at it, delete your MMOC acc and thus improve the community that's left on retail</div></div><hr />

You just complained about the lack of 10 man guilds and then immediately after mention going back to Nost, which is a version of game where those 10 people would be 25% of what you need. <br />
<br />
Why the hell are you even here if you don't play and don't like the game anymore? Just to be a vocal whiner?</div></div><hr />

I know it's a very hated zone, but gathering mats for weeks + opening the AQ gate and the Qirajii forces + Colossi rushing out was one of the best times of WoW for me. I think my guild stayed up 48 hours for the entirety of the event.<br />
<br />
I remember being in the zone for the event and the world server being down on and off for the entire day of the day. Missed pretty much the entire event including the actual opening and even when I was online and trying to attack the mobs I was barely able to cast an instant ability. Good times...<br />
<br />
I could have sat at my computer for the entire day and night spamming login and then maybe I could have played a massively laggy experience for a few mins at a time between the world server down messages.<br />
<br />

I so remember gathering the materials in vanilla. You would run around like a maniac gathering shit and you really had no clue what would come out of the time spent. Kids today will never understand farming. Spoiled generation with free epics and legendarys.<br />
<br />
I was there and turning in linen cloth was not an exhilerating experience. The pay off at the end was a ridiculously laggy unplayable event in which you could barely even cast an instant ability and the world server was constantly going down. I spent more time trying to login than actually in game (and when I was in game it was taking about 2 minutes to cast 1 spell).</div></div><hr />

Dang that's lame. I know our server crashed multiple times but, we never had world server is down for too long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is going to be a handful of people that go do it, realize they get zero from it and don't mess with it for more than 15 minutes probably.<br />
<br />
It doesn't need to offer gear but it needs an incentive or its dead content on arrival.<br />
<br />
Lol you guys are so greedy man. WoW kids these days. It's to commemorate the greatest even WoW has ever seen and it's there for fun.<br />
And there are plenty and plenty of people participating, so you statement is already dead.<br />
Its chaotic and it's fun to see some World PvP in Silithus again Horde vs Alliance.<br />
<br />
It actually turned out to be a very fun event imo lol. Horde and Alliance are going at it!</div></div><hr />

Thanks for the guide, MMO-C, nobody else has put one up, afaik!<br />
<br />
It's also noteworthy that turning the quests from the bosses in and doing the world quests shoud be interesting for leveling. I turned in a quest from a big summoned boss and it rewarded something like 320k xp at lvl 106.<br />
<br />
So levelers, go to Silithus, it's worth it, especially for leveling alts if you can't stomach any more questing in the Broken Isles :D</div></div><hr />
