<br />
Patch 7.2 Hotfixes - April 4<br />
Broken Shore<br />
<br />
Our Valarjar allies have deployed grapple points in key locations on Broken Shore.<br />
Broken Shore Rare Elite icons will now appear on the Broken Shore map even when the player is not currently in the Broken Shore.<br />
Creatures other than Rare Elites and Sentinax Lieutenants no longer drop Nethershards for players who are in a raid group.<br />
Rare Elites now fewer Sentinax Beacons.<br />
Portal enemies should now drop their beacon type much more often.<br />
Sentinax Lieutenants should drop multiple beacons for every player, allowing a quick restart after the break.<br />
Sentinax Lieutenants now drop many more Nethershards when slain.<br />
Sentinax cool-down time lowered to 3 minutes (was 5 minutes).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: These changes are aimed at aligning the pacing of the Sentinax area without significantly changing the rewards. Upgraded portals should feel more special, portal beacons more scarce, and the final boss for each round of Sentinax activity should be a more welcome sight. Since tapping rules and behaviors of large raids of players don’t present a good experience for nearby parties of five or fewer, and especially solo players who might come along, the change to drops for raid groups is intended to allow everyone more opportunities to tap enemies.<br />

A surprisingly high amount too. On my 106 prot warrior I was getting 63K exp per mission type and 6.3k bonus on the extra exp rewards. Doing some rough math (keyword rough) doing a full invasion should net you an easy 3 quarters of a level.</div></div><hr />

If you are not 110 you can not progress past the complete 4 invasion quests on zone <br />
You are not able to do the scenario or the final fight zone (temple in azuna for example) before the scenario unless you are 110</div></div><hr />

So true!<br />

&quot;Note that, when this hotfix is applied, any Legionfall War Supplies you have over the cap of 1000 will be lost. If you’re currently carrying more than that, please make sure to turn those extra War Supplies in before Thursday.&quot;<br />
<br />
So those who don't read every f***ing blue post or other informative wow sites constantly will be punished? How I hate this developer team.<br />
Just a side note: on 7.2 PTR I warned them this can happen... (this proves they don't read those bug reports or suggestions) <br />
People always try to do what is the most beneficial for them. Simply put the other two buildings' perks are shit.</div></div><hr />

thing is the idea of those towers being destroyed was fucked up from get go - they could do it in so many other ways like making building have several &quot;tiers&quot; each unlocking other perks and giving best perks as last &quot;floor&quot; - only requiring much more resources - but they choose most fucked up way of it and ofc its blown in their faces</div></div><hr />

I fully agree with their intent for this and it's pretty much consistent with their general philosophy of not promoting/allowing people to stock up. Having to wait to get the most optimal reward is simply shit design. What I don't agree with is that any existing supplies over the cap are completely lost. Not allowing any new ones to be earned would have been a better approach.</div></div><hr />

I still can't wrap my head around that. At the very least completing the clear all mobs invasion WQs should give like 75-100 rep and the kill boss ones should award 125-150 rep. Just my two cents. :confused:<br />

Yea, it would have been way better if they got DAMAGED and we just need to top them up to keep them from being totally destoryed. Would ahve kept the interest, and kept the ability for people like me who are not as skilled to keep trying the challenge. I can't play all day, I have to work! I get maybe 2 hours in the evenings. I'm not complaining about my lack of time, you understand, just that it's unlikely I'll be able to complete the challenge before the building goes away. No big deal, really. Just annoying.</div></div><hr />

Even that little Nightfallen span near the beginning where you only get 25 per... it was shit but it was still something. I didn't know about the Maiev quest, so I got NO rep at all from clearing every invasion point (I thought maybe it'd clear the zone wide &quot;assault&quot; warning) and the scenario, but nothing.</div></div><hr />

same here didn't know and the assault timer was at 00:00 remaining but it was on my map so it there and got a quest, i assumed that quest would give me the rep upon turn in but nope essentially wasted the assault GG blizz.... <br />

<br />
I had completed the 4 WQ's and the other quests leading up to the final scenario. I then que'd for the scenario and waited. After a short while I left the que to do a timewalking dungeon. After the dungeon I went back to the NPC location to re-que, and the NPC was no longer there. Map showed that the quest was available at this location but the NPC was missing. I could see other players gathered there to que so I know I was in the right location. Definitely a bug, didnt get to complete the first invasion.</div></div><hr />

could be easily 12 to make sure everyone has a chance to connect and play the game in a normal working day.<br />
I was thinking exactly the same. There is no opportunity to do it if you have a real life.<br />
<br />
Totally agree, thought blizzard actually learned from past misstakes. Guess i was wrong :)<br />
<br />
Invasions if you want to do every one at the start, you need to have no job. Wierd since the game basicly revolves around casual play imo :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes - I had several guildies purposefully hoarding their resources because they thought the Tower always gave the +rep buff, so they were hoarding them until the tower went up to mass turn in for extra rep.</div></div><hr />

If there was a little more consistency to their transparency, that would go a long way to quelling the hate and disappointment in the community right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However, the assaults are here to stay for the foreseeable future so everyone will have ample opportunities to get them done. There will always be at least one assault per day.<br />
Time-gate / meta RNG. Yay!<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Najja</div><div class="date">2017-04-05, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This whole thing has me underwhelmed. They said invasions... I pictured large scale attacks, waves of enemies pouring in from portals and falling from the sky, being bombarded with attacks from legion ships. What do we get? about 10 - 15 enemies come out of several portals a few at a time... The legion is supposed to be vast, near endless and the best they can do on their assault of our world is handfuls of low tier enemies? Only one battleship that actually lets them bring in reinforcements? A ship that 'gets tired' after summoning one actually semi powerful demon? A ship with such apparently limited firepower that it can only fire on a small cluster of targets for maybe 10 seconds before it runs out.<br />
<br />
Also yeah, what group of geniuses decided that in the event that they knew hordes of people would rush to participate in that enemies should be limited to only 5 tags? It's imbecilic on a scale that I can't even properly articulate. Do you know what isn't fun Blizz? Opening a portal only to have a group of people from the other faction swoop in and take all the kills. <br />
<br />
The zone attacks are the only part, aside from its duration, that seems to be working and in a decent state.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;The entire cycle is 4 zones every 3 days, repeating forever. If you miss something today, it'll be back in a couple of days.&quot;<br />
<br />
Well...Guess it's no sleeping for me in the next 2 days, almost revered with legionfall, so just 3 more invasions, and we're flying.</div></div><hr />
