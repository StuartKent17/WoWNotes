Our 10 man had this happen last night too. If you're killing them fast enough corpses will still be up... we had all 4 fall down to Anub'arak's room. Curious how they handled Anub... couldn't figure out what to do with the ice/or just need more dps.</div></div><hr />

It's actually not that tough outside Anub... my guild's nothing great and we had 49 attempts left on Anub (which would have been 50 but got owned by the portal on Jaraxxus 'cause we didn't know how it would work). Immortality might be a bit more difficult.</div></div><hr />

Huh? Did your guild kill everything as well? First day and 10 guilds worldwide have done something worthwhile. Blizzard didn't make the game for them alone. It will be many many weeks and a few nerfs before the little people start making their way closer to Anub.</div></div><hr />

That's weird because the titles for Realm First achievements for leveling were removed before WOTLK released. The reward for Realm First! First Aid was &quot;Doctor&quot; title but how does this player have it? lol</div></div><hr />

He doesn't have Realm First 450 First Aid, he didnt even clear all the first aid achievements.... <br />

It doesnt appear to be anywhere in his achievements, which means it was one of those &quot;You dont know how to get it, but when you do it will appear&quot; titles given in vanilla wow (For example, you had no hints that you would get conqueror/justicar)<br />

My brother has the same bug... to translate it for you:<br />
Quite a lot of players on those realms got these Server-First-Titles... without knowing how they got them.<br />
Seems like some random bug, where random people got ALL those titles without doing anything for it... just like logging in and BAM there they are.<br />

<br />
Any moron that actually says this, which there are a lot of them nowadays, are completely missing the point.<br />
<br />
You see, it's actually very reasonable to have a negative response to news like this. Whether you've done it or not.<br />
<br />
The heroic mode hasn't even been open for 24 hours, 'For the Horde' has already completed the 0 wipe mode in the 10 man.<br />
<br />
That says ALOT to anyone that was looking forward to some decent challenge.<br />
<br />
You see. New encounters have a level of trial and error involved, with the 10 man being the heroic (hard mode) it should be expected for everyone to have to adjust the first time in.<br />
<br />
Even if absolutely nothing was on the PTR, we'd have the same results. These encounters are that poorly tuned.<br />
<br />
We've only had access to i245 gear so far, so there's not a huge disparity in item levels required for the heroic mode.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am in no way belittling anyone's hard work and achievement to do it first and so quickly. Neither are most others that have an issue here.<br />
<br />
I realize this was a filler patch. But that is no exception for the encounters to be tuned in such a way. This raid is over-saturating item levels to an extraordinary level, especially now that we see clearing the heroic modes is a walk in the park for the top guilds. The item levels are ridiculously higher than Ulduar 25 Hard modes, which will put the highest Icecrown item levels pushing 300.<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously it will take longer for the lower rung guilds to do. But that doesn't mean we do not have the right to be thoroughly disappointed. So keep your collective, &quot;Where's your achievement?&quot; bullcrap to yourselves.</div></div><hr />

No, YOU are missing the point. Forget the top guilds that have done well, they are in the minority that no adjectives can describe well enough. Let's just say it's literally one in a half-a-million.<br />
For the market Blizzard aims at, the 99% who won't get any worthwhile 'achievement' for many lockouts to come, this is perfectly tuned. My own personal guild have managed to get to Faction Champions (25) and quit with 20 odd tries left because we can tell there is no way we where going to do it with current gear/skill levels. We are a top 130 EU guild. If the best guilds in the world smash through this in 12 hours, that's their skill/problem/endurance/insanity, the rest of us will take the appropriate amount of time Blizzard intended. People are going on like morons as if every guild in the world will have Anub down by the end of the night. U.S couldn't kill him yesterday or even get to him, Ensidia right now is wiping (playing on Magtheridon EU and seeing them in and out of the instances as they run back.) and may or may not kill them. If the best guild this game has ever seen can't faceroll him, feel free to bet your last penny that the 'little people' guilds won't see him any time soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit. May have gotten them, they are all back in Dalaran.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ballador</div><div class="date">2009-09-02, 09:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all ... don't get me started on the fact that Blizzard did extended maintenance on my server group until 9:30 PM CST last night ... 2 hours AFTER this was already done, which upsets me greatly!!<br />
<br />
Second, directly responding to Slotter ... if you have a problem with other people getting gear and seeing end game content, that is only because you are an elitist and stuck-up! While my guild does casual raiding and usually only one or two nights a week, that doesn't mean that we shouldn't be able to experience end game content. That is part of the reason they re-designed Naxx and made it the first raid in Wrath. There were so few guilds on my server that were even able to ENTER Naxx in Vanilla that they were catering to the upper echelon of WoW subscribers. Even in Burning Crusade, we had Karazhan mastered ... but we didn't have enough people to get a full Gruul or Magtheridon group together. I feel Blizzard has FINALLY done right by the smaller guilds. Small guilds can progress from 10-Naxx to 10-Uld to 10-ToC and finally to 10-Ice without having to group up with another 15 people that aren't in their guild. In BC, unless your small guild joined up with a larger guild, you would never see the inside of Serpentshrine, or Tempest Keep, or Mount Hyjal, or Black Temple!! What is the freaking point of me paying the same amount of money that you are and NEVER being able to see the inside of Black Temple? Don't we both put the same amount of money into the game? Shouldn't we both be able to benefit from new content expansions? You, Slotter, are missing the ENTIRE POINT of having both 10-man and 25-man content!<br />
<br />
Now, Congrats to For the Horde. If my guess is correct, they were completely clearing Ulduar 25 and were in gear that reflected as much. So yes, 10-man ToC (Heroic even) WILL BE EASIER given their gear alone, let alone the amount of skill that I am sure they have to match their gear ... DUH!!!!!<br />
<br />
Again, I feel the point of this will be missed. But, the entire purpose of having the raid setup that they did, was so that a guild that is smaller in size would still be able to actually play end game content. My smaller guild was never able to even step foot inside ANY of the 25-man BC instances until we &quot;made an alliance&quot; with another TWO guilds!<br />
<br />
If you think it is too easy ... try putting on all 10-man Ulduar gear and completing the same achievement! You won't ... but I want to see ya try. Try completeing the entire 10-man ToC raid in nothing but 219 gear in every single slot (maybe a few 226 items as those can be obtained from Ulduar 10 hard modes) ... because THIS is the benchmark Blizzard created this content to be possible in. Blizzard does not need to wake up, Slotter, you need to accept the fact that Blizzard FINALLY (after 4 or 5 years) realized that they were expressly catering to the upper 2% of WoW players and decided to make End-Game content attainable to all. If you don't like it, QQ and go play something else.</div></div><hr />

We went in earlier today - we'd not been on PTRs, not talked to anyone who had done the HMs, only read a few &quot;additional abilities&quot; - and we got to the Twins with 50 attempts remaining. Unfortunately a wipe on them messed us up a little, but we're still at Anub with 49 remaining. We can't be described as anywhere near a &quot;top&quot; guild - though we formed a couple of months after Ulduar released, we've not downed Yogg+1 or Algalon yet (though we've not tried the former, and only the latter for an hour).<br />
<br />
While this achievement is tough, I wouldn't say it's anywhere near as hard as it should be. Shame really, but there are still some pretty intense moments in the fights. I guess if we wipe 30 times on Anub HM then it's egg on my face, but we'll see :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok look, I don't want this to turn more into a QQ thread than it already is, but at least on 10-man, the only part of the beasts fight which is difficult is Icehowl's charge. This cost my guild about 8 wipes until we managed to get it right. It's otherwise the same strategy as normal, stuff just hits slightly harder.<br />
<br />
The demon lord boss wasn't very hard, we almost had it on our first attempt. In fact i'd say it's at the difficulty level it should've been at on normal mode - around Freya +1 difficulty.<br />
<br />
The faction champs ARE THE EXACT SAME DIFFICULTY LEVEL AS NORMAL. Seriously - yes you'll perhaps wipe, perhaps even repeatedly, but it depends on the luck of the draw as much as anything. Which, let's face it, probably means that normal mode is in for a serious nerf. The end of the fight is just as /faceroll as usual. <br />
<br />
The twins are suddenly ACTUALLY HARD. Yes, seriously, the easiest boss in normal mode is one of the hardest in there on hard mode. Constantly heavy raid damage even when you're doing it right. A lot of DPS needed to break the shield. Healers going OOM early. Hard boss. But it's clearly possible.<br />
<br />
That's as far as my guild got tonight, with over 30 attempts remaining for the last 2 bosses. We're certainly not the most awesome, hardcore guild out there, we certainly don't go around claiming server firsts, and yet we just cleared a whole instance, including 1-shotting a boss none of us had seen before, followed by killing 3 &quot;new&quot; hard mode bosses. And still had time to start on the 4th. I'm not saying the difficulty setting is wrong, but for where it's at in progression, it's what it SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON NORMAL MODE.<br />
<br />
Still, gratz on these guys clearing it without wiping. Very pro.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He no longer gives you a run speed increase. So it's a bit random whether he goes for a class without their own run-speed-increasing, or immunity abilities (bubbles, iceblock, etc). It's REALLY close if you don't have these available and he charges you. Probably a lot easier if a hunter can give you aspect of the dazed, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People ... this is 10-man. If you have been running 25-man Ulduar and defeating hard modes left and right, then 10-man TOC IS GOING TO BE EASIER FOR YOU! Period. That is the way it was designed!!<br />
<br />
The natural progression paths are SEPARATE!<br />
<br />
10-Naxx --&gt; 10-EoE --&gt; 10-Uld --&gt; 10-ToC --&gt; 10-Ice<br />
25-Naxx --&gt; 25-EoE--&gt; 25-Uld --&gt; 25-ToC --&gt; 25-Ice<br />
<br />
If you have 10 good players then you can progress all the way to 10-Ice without ever setting foot in a 25-man raid. That is the entire point of having this progression path. So, naturally, completing 25-Uld with Hard Modes is going to make 10 ToC much easier as you already have gear comparable to 10-ToC or even 10-ToC-HM.<br />
<br />
I also have to agree with Pickahoad ... <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
This is what Blizzard was changing with this expansion. Making end-game raiding accessible to a lot more raiders, not just the upper 1% or 2% of all players (as they did with Naxx in Vanilla).<br />
<br />
It isn't that difficult to figure this out, people. <br />
<br />
Once again, grats to For the Horde. World First is a big achievement for anyone, and they deserve it. But, had they NEVER run 25-Ulduar or gotten the hard modes ... then they would not have gotten this achievement this quickly.<br />
<br />
Also ... EXPECT the same thing to happen with Icecrown. There will be guilds that concentrate on 10-man while sitting in nothing but 25-ToC-HM gear in order to get the World First achievements while other guilds concentrate on the 25-man version.<br />
<br />
If you are still having trouble understanding this ... then try going to http://www.wow-heroes.com put in your realm and character name, and look at the graph. 25-Ulduar is the SAME DIFFICULTY LEVEL at 10-ToC ... And if you are geared PAST 25-Ulduar (the green bar is past the Ulduar 25-man button below the line), then you are geared past 10-ToC (which is directly above Ulduar 25-man).</div></div><hr />

seems like obsidian sanctum is above competition, so better don't try before 25 Ice is clear ::)</div></div><hr />

The differences from non heroic have to be learned... they must've went out of their way to prepare. Do it on alts, get it down, and run it for real on mains. That's the only way I figure they could've learned without wipes.<br />
<br />
Preparation is key for improving chance of success.<br />
<br />
Props to these guys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
just to make things clear: we never focused on 10-man world first achievements, it was only part of our 25-man progression unless you might learn something in 10-man hard mode to save more tries later. (just like algalon, we used our 10man hour as a kind of warm-up)</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
Obviously it will take longer for the lower rung guilds to do. But that doesn't mean we do not have the right to be thoroughly disappointed. So keep your collective, &quot;Where's your achievement?&quot; bullcrap to yourselves. <br />

<br />
Of course...I was wrong.<br />
<br />
According to wowprogress, they achieved A Tribute to Insanity at the exact same time as their Call of the Grand Crusade achievement, exactly one hour after clearing the instance on normal mode.<br />
<br />
Well done, guys, that's monumentally impressive.</div></div><hr />

We had, both Worms, Icehowl, the Twins and Lord Jaraxxus fall with us. During Champions, it would have been funny to hide behind Icehowl as a LoS. But alas, that is not the case.</div></div><hr />

Tribute to Insanity 10-man is probably tuned for ilvl 232 and 245 which are the ilvls of the gear dropping from the CC10 normal and heroic. This means a 25-man guild decked in 226 and 239 items is actually quite close to the intended gear level.</div></div><hr />
