Armory Stats - Battle.Net Shop Mounts<br />
Today we are taking a look at the ownership percentages of Battle.Net Shop Mounts. The sample used was 2.2 million players active since November 1, 2015. Keep in mind that most of the mounts and pets are still 50% off until January 4th (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/395310-winter-veil-sale-select-pets-and-mounts-50-off/). <br />
<br />
The popularity of the mounts roughly falls in line with when they were released (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Battle.net_Store#Mounts_released_at_the_Battle.net_Store), except for the poor Swift Windsteed (http://www.wowdb.com/items/92724-swift-windsteed).<br />

Poll - Most Desired Battle.Net Shop Mount<br />
Which mount would you have liked to see Greatfather Winter bring you this year?<br />
<br />

<br />
Ring in the New Year!<br />
Happy New Year!<br />
<br />
The celebration begins at 6:00 p.m. realm time tonight (December 31) with wonderful fireworks in the skies above the cities, and repeats every hour on the hour.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/thumb/newYear.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2015/december/newYear.jpg) <br />
<br />
Feel free to sample some of the exotic brews and libations carted in from around the world, and dance in celebration as a new year dawns.<br />
<br />
Warning: If you're on a PvP realm, you're cautioned to steer clear of Booty Bay (or perhaps get yourself to Booty Bay for the best party around) as the guards there appear to have had too much fun already and aren't likely to be enforcing the town rules until morning.<br />
<br />

Heroes of the Storm - Beyond the Worlds<br />
We have seen some nice WoW machinima lately, but there is also some interesting Heroes machinima that was released this year. Rather than using the existing Heroes models, they created their own. <br />

<br />
See, this is the reason people can spend money on cosmetics. They like a company/game enough and finds the cosmetic in question good enough.<br />
<br />
You might like to spend some extra on Rocket league, another might want to spend 2000 bucks on league of legends, someone might not care at all. We're all different and have different tastes, I've bought two store mounts because I really liked them. <br />

<br />
they're the reason you aren't paying even more for a box or sub fee. i've pointed this out before, but when i started playing MMOs back in the late 90s with ultima online and everquest, the game box and sub fees were almost what they are right now. they aren't that different. i think my EQ sub started out as 9-10/month and then jumped to 12-13/month. even console games cost 50-70 bucks back then.<br />
<br />
people can't expect game prices to stay the same forever without some other source of profit. don't want a regular WoW expansion to cost $100 and the collectors to cost $150? then make peace with store pets and mounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is wrong. the economics behind it are just wrong.<br />
<br />
there are many times more consumers today than there was back then.<br />
<br />
when we were young and the avg console game was $60 (same as today) sales were measured in the tens of thousands, on some platforms in the hundreds of thousands, but that was it.<br />
<br />
todays markets are measured in the millions of units. so your logic about things having to cost more to make money is flawed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This one seems to belive he's not only not helping Blizzard push a very anti-consumer practice, but that he's actually HELPING customers keeping the box and sub low.<br />
<br />
Really.<br />
<br />
You could have just said &quot;i'm a shit person and i don't care at all if they do this, i like them mounts i have money and i buy them. fuck the rest&quot;. But no, you had to disillusion yourself with this fancy fantasy with no base in real financial numbers and practices.<br />
<br />
To those that don't know: WoW is HUGELY profitable with 10M subs, and it's still very profitable with 4-5M subs. The money they make more than pays the game costs, there is plenty left to finance their other projects and to keep banked. Paid services and store items are just a plus. They're very cheap to produce and immensely profitable. They might annoy some resistant players and hurt the game design a bit, but players still buy and it doesn't entirely break the gaming experience for all, so why not do them?<br />
Again, i don't think it's an honest or fair practice, but as long as idiot customers support them, they'll push it. And why wouldn't them?<br />
<br />
TL;DR: You're an idiot and you're not helping anyone but yourself. Enjoy your shiny mount.</div></div><hr />

See its comments like this that show just how blatantly ignorant people are to the game. They see these<br />
mounts and immediately think it must've taken Blizzard's ENTIRE development team just to<br />
make this one mount. This one mount cost them several hundreds of hours of brand new content.<br />
<br />
And this guy says we're the ones who are retarded? You sir, who live in a glass house, should not throw stones.<br />
<br />
And these same people probably complain when Blizzard makes a mini pet/mount for charity purposes (they<br />
even say 100% of the profits go to it) and probably think, &quot;Fuck those poor people, I want my new content!&quot;<br />
<br />
Its a good thing that the majority of the community doesn't think like you. If you'd like to continue to gorge<br />
on salt, please be my guest. I will enjoy the mounts I buy from them, as will others.<br />
<br />
Oh and if it bothers you so much, you could, I dunno, stop playing the game then. Personally I think its more<br />
&quot;retarded&quot; to get so angry at the company yet still support their product by playing it.</div></div><hr />

We know it doesn't take away from the development team, problem is that it is an extra cost on top of the box price and the sub price. On top of that, in the last year we have had the worst expansion to date and an increase in sub price (well atleast in the UK it went up at the end of 2014)<br />
<br />
We call them greedy because in an expansion lacking content and pretty much only has like 3 mounts in it and their different colour reskins, rather than give people challenges to do to get unique mounts they just throw more and more of them on the store. I am actually surprised they let people acquire the moose mount in game at all wihtout having to get it from the store.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the problem with the store mounts. Not that they exist but the fact people think they would automatically add content to the game if they were added through an in-game method.<br />
<br />
For instance.<br />
<br />
What content would the celestial steed add had it simply been a 1% drop off Algalon? <br />
Or what would the Heart of the Aspect had added? <br />
<br />
The mounts would have simply been used later as rewards for content that was already in-game. When things are cut from the game it is because of every department other than art most likely. So these would have sat in the files until Blizzard needed a mount for a reward. <br />
<br />
Look at the Moose mount. Randomly added to Heroic and Mythic Archimonde with a small quest to go talk to an NPC. If that is the kind of content this takes away then I'm sorry you can't talk to more NPCs. <br />
<br />
And yes, I'm a proud owner of all the store mounts EXCEPT the Warforged Nightmare. And most of the pets. But most of the pets were gifted rather than me buying them. I like to support a company that cares about its playerbase more than most other gaming companies out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, except content was never cut because the artists couldn't get to it fast enough. Lay that at the feet of deadlines for quest and encounter developers.<br />
<br />
On the flip side, who would buy a mount that wasn't unique? How many people would seriously plunk down cash for a green nightsaber versus a blue one? Is padding your number of mounts collected really worth $15?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used a small not completely random sample to answer the question, as hitting the entire data set would take a long time. Around 27% of players have at least one mount, 18% have 2 or more, 13% have 3 or more, and 2% have all of them. Keep in mind that it was a small and not completely random sample, but it should give you a general idea.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people bought it as this mount was given to all your current and future characters on that account.<br />
<br />
It saved you quite some gold (you still needed to buy the skill)<br />
Remember when you reached 40 or 60, there was no way you had enough gold to buy skill+mount. so every bit of gold saved for a 1-time payment was a good deal.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coconut</div><div class="date">2016-01-01, 12:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">(I didn't expect such a high number. With that high number they know they can keep milking the shit out of wow's store. Expect more high quality item models going to store with the revamped transmog system inc)<br />
<br />
The numbers are actually... quite low.<br />
<br />
At least in terms of revenue for Blizzard. The price of a mount is roughly equal to a 2 months prepaid, and slightly higher than a token. It's half that when it has a discount. So the income from a single mount is roughly equal to one-two months of subscription for an average of 12% of the player base.<br />
<br />
Basically, if putting one store mount in game rather than the store convinces 12% of players to sub for two extra months when they otherwise wouldn't have (or 24% sub for one month), it is more profitable to put the mount in game than on the store.<br />
<br />
I've been trying to make that (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1845007-Has-The-Blizzard-Store-Ruined-The-Game?p=35628755&amp;viewfull=1#post35628755) point (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1851514-Would-you-still-buy-store-mounts-if-we-had-recolors-in-game) since the first time we thought the Grove Warden was going to be a store mount.<br />
<br />
It seems like Blizzard had the same thought, since they added that mount to Heroic Archimonde instead. I think it will turn out to be the more profitable choice for them, with people resubbing to get the moose and some non-raiders buying tokens to finance Heroic boosts. In fact, I'm very hopeful about it, since if it turns out this way, it will mean less store mounts and cooler models in game.</div></div><hr />

And before the fanboys come crying, the playerbase isn't 2.2 million, so even with taking the reduced prices into account there will be far more mounts sold than the 16.8% of 2.2 million players/accounts, so 7 million is most likely below the amount Blizzard really made.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ThatsOurEric</div><div class="date">2016-01-01, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, just look at that. Here we have a store mount buyer with powers to read other peoples thoughts.<br />
It so happens that i didn't say that at all, you just presumed it heaven knows from what.<br />
<br />
Your argument practically mirrors the same sentiments as the ones I've complained about, so don't even remotely try<br />
to play dumb. It will not work out for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
There you go. But how is that a surprise? Dude can't even read, one cannot expect him to grasp the implications of store mounts.<br />
<br />
Do you realize just how absurd you sound? &quot;Implications?&quot; Have we gotten bombarded with Store Mounts? Purchasable transmog armor sets,<br />
max ilvl item sets, Gold?<br />
<br />
No?<br />
<br />
Then your complaints are not only unfounded, but baseless and are as always, the best example of a player who is complaining<br />
for no good reason, other than to shit on others who enjoy something that he clearly doesn't. Evidently, it is impossible for you<br />
to live and let live, so please, do yourself and all of us a favor : stop playing.<br />
<br />
Because the only shitty person I and the rest of us see here, is you. And no defense you can muster can change that.<br />
<br />
<br />
We know it doesn't take away from the development team, problem is that it is an extra cost on top of the<br />
box price and the sub price. On top of that, in the last year we have had the worst expansion to date and an increase in sub price<br />
(well atleast in the UK it went up at the end of 2014)<br />
<br />
Now here is someone with sense, as well as respect. Are you paying attention salty people?<br />
<br />
I hear what you're saying, but once more, you have to keep in mind that unlike that box &amp; sub price (which I am sorry to hear<br />
you Euro players got a price hike), these store mounts are OPTIONAL.<br />
<br />
So to hear it being &quot;extra&quot; cost just doesn't cut it. If it was mandatory (like say, they wanted RL money to get access to another<br />
tier of raid difficulty), then I can totally see the argument for extra cost. But for something completely optional? No dice.<br />
<br />
And the expansion sold well, subscription numbers notwithstanding.<br />
<br />
<br />
We call them greedy because in an expansion lacking content<br />
<br />
There's actually a lot to do. Whether or not you find those things fun is another case entirely.<br />
<br />
<br />
only has like 3 mounts in it and their different colour reskins,<br />
<br />
Okay, you have me there.<br />
<br />
<br />
I want to punch everyone who bought anything from the Blizzard in-game store through their skull.<br />
<br />
So your first instinct is that rather than being a mature, able-minded adult, and not participating (which you are<br />
free to do) in a transaction that does not affect you one bit...is violence.<br />
<br />
How ironic that you are instead, the sole biggest problem with gaming right now. Here let me re-quote you, and while you're<br />
reading this, you should look in a mirror when doing so :<br />
<br />
You, yes you, are one of the biggest problems in gaming if not the biggest.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hold them down, i want to throw a few punches as well. Its a shame they dont understand they are ruining gaming for everyone.<br />
<br />
May want to share that mirror, because we got another internet tough guy here.<br />
<br />
<br />
These mounts used to be FREE!<br />
<br />
That is purely subjective. You buy the mount, you get it instantly. You want say, the Time Lost Proto Drake? Get ready to spend<br />
days, possibly weeks, possibly months, farming for hours that mount, on top of competing with others.<br />
<br />
Sure, its free. But time spent getting it is just as &quot;expensive&quot;. I mean you are spending your subscription time trying to get it.<br />
Let's say it took you 6 months to get it. Technically you just spent $90 trying to get a mount. Sure, you were doing other things<br />
in the game, but you were also really working hard to get that mount. If your time spent getting that mount was the majority<br />
of your time playing, which is your subscription time, then you spent that $90 for a mount.<br />
<br />
<br />
So many idiots buying these mounts and people wonder why blizzard keeps adding more<br />
<br />
To which I ask, so many &quot;idiots&quot; complaining about the store mounts, do they realize they don't have to buy them?</div></div><hr />

So that's how the world works over here in reality. Don't know what it's like in Candyland or wherever you're from, though.</div></div><hr />

It sounds impressive to the layman but for the size of Blizzard it's peanuts. The problem is that some of their practices in services payments alienate some users for ethical reasons (it's especially important for the transfer service). That alienation does long-term damage to the game that can translate to money and can't easily be predicted.</div></div><hr />

Around 27% of players have at least one mount, 18% have 2 or more, 13% have 3 or more, and 2% have all of them. Keep in mind that it was a small and not completely random sample, but it should give you a general idea.<br />
Oh thanks a lot.<br />
That is nice knowing. Tbh thought it would be more with this many having at least one.<br />
Thanks for the reply (and post)</div></div><hr />

A lot of people bought it as this mount was given to all your current and future characters on that account.<br />
<br />
It saved you quite some gold (you still needed to buy the skill)<br />
Remember when you reached 40 or 60, there was no way you had enough gold to buy skill+mount. so every bit of gold saved for a 1-time payment was a good deal.<br />
<br />
perhaps that puts it bit more in perspective for some here<br />
<br />
Ye that was the first account wide mount in the game, way before account wide mounts were ever introduced.</div></div><hr />
