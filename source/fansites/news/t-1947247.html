<br />
It’s with a great deal of joy that we celebrate Blizzard’s 25th Anniversary. In February of 1991, our founders came together to make video games, and it wouldn’t be long before they began work on the first new world built entirely by Blizzard Entertainment: Azeroth.<br />
<br />
The many stories and varied types of gameplay that have taken place on Azeroth (and later, Draenor) have never stopped coming. The history of Warcraft and the history of Blizzard Entertainment are fully intertwined, with each passing year falling into a unique Warcraft era for players. Those who started in with Warcraft eight years ago, for instance, started during the Burning Crusade. Those who started twelve years ago started during the Reign of Chaos era.<br />
<br />
However long you’ve been with us, we hope you accept our heartiest thanks and gratitude for all you’ve done to help us expand the excitement and wonder of these magical worlds. We’re going to continue to explore them with you for a very long time to come.<br />
<br />

Blizzard's 25th Anniversary<br />
When I was a kid, I used to beg my parents to let me go over to my friend Ben's place so we could play Justice League Task Force on his SNES. I didn't know it until very recently, but that was my first experience with a Blizzard game.<br />
<br />
A couple years later, my friend Aaron introduced me to Starcraft. I'd played Warcraft I and II, but Starcraft really hooked me. Many of my formative years were spent hauling my PC across town to have LAN parties and just play Starcraft for hours on end.<br />
<br />
When Warcraft III came out, it blew my mind - both the storytelling and gameplay were top-notch. Plus, since the internet had advanced to the point that I no longer needed to tie up a phone line to play online, I was able to stay connected with my friends (some of whom had moved to other states) by playing Warcraft with them.<br />
<br />
Then I learned that Blizzard was working on an MMORPG. I'd cut my teeth on MMOs like Anarchy Online and Star Wars: Galaxies, but I knew that Blizzard was going to make something awesome. After all, Blizzard made the best games. Of course they were going to do the same in the MMORPG genre.<br />
<br />
I had no idea how much World of Warcraft was going to impact my life.<br />
<br />
It started out simple enough: I was just a moderator on a set of forums focusing on Prot Paladins. Then I was a co-host on a tanking-focused podcast. Then I was making the occasional boss guides for YouTube. Then a weekly vlog series. Then two. Then I was producing a weekly live show. Then two. Then three.<br />
<br />
And then, I saw an opening for a Community Manager position at Blizzard Entertainment. I applied. I interviewed. I got an offer, which I accepted. Then I moved to California.<br />
<br />
It's still crazy to me how much came out of just being really into a video game. I still have days sometimes where I show up to work, look up at the building, and think to myself holy **** I work at Blizzard Entertainment. I have a career because of World of Warcraft. I met my wife because of World of Warcraft. Pretty much everything about my life is, in some way or another, caused or affected by World of Warcraft. That's crazy.<br />
<br />
Sure, Blizzard has its missteps. Sure, we're not perfect. I don't think any collection of human beings ever can be.<br />
<br />
But damn if we don't make some pretty good video games. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/401181-blizzs-25th-anniversary-is-this-month/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742154291?page=1#6))<br />

Patch 6.2.4 PTR Notes<br />
Another PTR build went out today, removing the logo from the login screen. It is possible this was unintended. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/february/thumb/liveLogin.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/february/liveLogin.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/february/thumb/ptrLogin.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/february/ptrLogin.jpg) <br />
<br />
Patch 6.2.4 is being prepared for testing on the Public Test Realms (PTR). Participating on the Public Test Realms lets you test a patch before it has been released on live realms. If you'd like to help test and provide feedback, you can start by copying your character and downloading the PTR client. Once you've had a chance to try things out, visit the PTR Discussion forum to discuss the patch. To report issues or errors, use the in-game Submit Bug feature (found under Game Menu -&gt; Help -&gt; Submit Bug) or by visiting the PTR Bug Report forum.<br />
<br />
Battle.net Infrastructure<br />
<br />
Client support for Battle.net infrastructure changes, including some memory optimizations.<br />

<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Does that argument hold ground when private servers have maintained high populations for years though?<br />
Their sub cost might have something to do with that? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/691466174576463876))<br />
<br />
A sad casualty of all that was the Shadow Priest support role in BC, which hasn't been reproduced since. <br />
True,though we heard from many who didn't want to just be a mana battery. They wanted to do dps. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/692018848497803264))<br />
That may be the biggest challenge of game design: players want different things. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/692018976168128515))<br />
Yet if you try to please everyone, you end up with a mushy, compromised design. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/692019085425582081))<br />

You mean the part where they made Aussie servers?<br />

And before tears, I started playing while living in New Zealand on a west coast server. <br />

And then some would come back. Then quit again. Then come back again. Then quit all over again. Its a horrible cycle. Which I blame other mmos for trying to beat WoW but just turned into clones of WoW instead of breaking the mold and truly be original.</div></div><hr />

You should try to get a tour of their HQ, so many statues, posters, figurines (released and non-released) etc. all over the place. Every couple years of working there you get a piece of armor, if you work there for 20+ years, you get a helm, shield, and sword (real btw) along with small gifts every other few years. I have a nerdgasm every time I get to go</div></div><hr />

My subscription is up in a couple of months. It's been at least 60 days since I logged in. I've felt zero temptation to come back. I haven't deleted the game yet, or 'Favorite' links like to this website, but the other day I clicked over to here just to read some fucking dev being quoted in twitter enlightening us all with something to the effect of, &quot;How much gold we charge you to switch specs isn't interesting, what item we charge you is&quot; or some similar bullshit to that. Well guess what Blizz, none of that bullshit sounded even a little interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, not everything is amazingly interesting. Some stuff is going to be boring. Discussing how tri spec works/costs was never going to be interesting. Which was exactly his fucking point. You're pointing out that its not interesting that he's pointing out something isn't very interesting and trying to spin it as you being on the upper ground. <br />
<br />
If you're not enjoying the game anymore, just....stop. Don't visit news sites to laud about how you don't play. Don't think about the game in your spare time, or sit there fuming 60 FUCKING DAYS after you stopped playing, just stop. <br />
<br />
I will never understand why people can't just stop playing and be done with it, why do people feel the need to stick around and tell everyone how disinterested they are, while still feverishly visiting MMO-C? I took a break from near the start of Cata to part way through MoP. Not ONCE during all that time did I visit MMO-C, or WoW websites. Because I wasn't playing or enjoying the game during that time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is called MMO-Champion. WoW is the Champion of all MMO's, thus a WoW website. The fact you still haven't figured this out after all these years... well kind of makes you not exactly smart.<br />
<br />
Also the salt in these comments already kind of proves the DL comic at the bottoms point. So many people sit on here whinging and bitching every day about how bad WoW is and how much Blizzard sucks, but face it. There is nothing better out there. That is why you guys hang around a Wow forum CONSTANTLY. Since no one would really be that PATHETIC to hang around something for so long if they truly hated it right? Of course not.<br />
<br />
If you hate WoW so much leave the website. Otherwise you are just showing how pathetic and infantile of a Human being you really are.</div></div><hr />

And calling people infantile doesn't make you look smart, but I guess that's what the WoW community today is all about. You can't discuss a topic without someone trying to be a badass.<br />
<br />
I guess a lot of people can tell you're bitching about inane stuff. Presumably you know all about this site not suddenly switching to all MMO's, after being here for that long. Blizzard fan dominated here, plenty of other sites to hang about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People forget that Token (players) are not counted in Subscription figures, and that (I suggest) is one of the reasons Blizzard have decided not to publish future Subscription numbers -because it an outdated metric.<br />
<br />
The DLC is about right though, it is a cycle, and Blizzard try to respond to it; the problem that can't be addressed however, for players, is that we simply do not have as much time for the game as we used to -obligations IRL, work, family etc, we all grow up but the game remains a time commitment and any deviation away from the classic MMO (WoW) model is seen as pandering to the casuals [sic].<br />
<br />
Just my two points!</div></div><hr />

last time i checked, WoW isnt pay to win, unless you go through illegal channels. and buying skins and mounts on HotS isnt exatly pay to win either. mini transactions on SCII is for missions, which dont exactly give you and edge either. and hearthstone, well its a card game so yea youll have to pay for that and be llucky to get good card. ofcourse unless you make em yourself. so idk wtf youre talking about.</div></div><hr />

Nothing is pay-to-win. Even buying a trillion-DPS weapon, if that were possible, is not pay-to-win, because you don't literally win and it'd be possible to still lose.<br />
<br />
That's why I said pay-for-advantage. That's what it is. An advantage.<br />
<br />
Buying BoE epics is an advantage relative to not buying BoE epics.<br />
<br />
Buying a powerful hero or a counter-pick hero is an advantage relative to not buying that hero.<br />
<br />
Buying useful cards to create powerful decks is an advantage relative to not buying those cards and hence not being able to create those powerful decks.<br />
<br />
Half of Blizzard's games are now pay-for-advantage.</div></div><hr />

SO what dose this have to do with WOW :P? In wow there is BOEs , but its not blizzard who is selling them, its players. <br />
So if BOE makes a game Pay for advantage then all games are that, crafting some times make BOEs in sub games and f2p. <br />

No, you don't get the advantage of having that BoE epic/hero/card for the entire duration of time that it takes you to grind for the in-game currency needed to afford it, unless you buy it for real money. So it's pay-for-advantage.<br />
<br />

<br />
The DLC is about right though, it is a cycle, and Blizzard try to respond to it; the problem that can't be addressed however, for players, is that we simply do not have as much time for the game as we used to -obligations IRL, work, family etc, we all grow up but the game remains a time commitment and any deviation away from the classic MMO (WoW) model is seen as pandering to the casuals [sic].<br />
<br />
Just my two points!<br />
<br />
Are you sure about that Token player thing? Tokens are just the same as game cards, they provide an amount of game time for a defined monetary value. They should be counted just as game card players are.<br />

Well you either have the time to grind gold and buy your BoE in the AH, or you don't have the time to grind, but a well-paid job, and get your gold by paying another guy's game time. That's not a new phenomenon, BTW. Some guilds have had such cooperations of their players. And sell-runs and carries are not very new, either. You just have an official channel now for gold transactions, whereas before, shady websites did that for you. So, technically speaking, WoW is already P2W in some regard.<br />
<br />
Besides that, having less time at your hands is the hardest disadvantage in this game, has ever been, will stay forever - especially when devs will keep their stance on &quot;prolonging&quot; content with time waste strategies like no flying at max level and gating of things.</div></div><hr />

If you are referring to the boost how is it pay to win? It doesn't give you Gladiator pvp titles, Upgraded mythic wf gear and ring, Every single achievement or anything like that. I will say however I would rather them make leveling interesting than a cash grab being the option but meh its Blizzard. If you want true pay to win have a look at RIFT's recent updates.</div></div><hr />

That is really the sad truth. It makes them cash like nothing else, and keeps on generating profits mid and long term. Unfortunately, I always enjoyed Blizzard's Single Player Games the most (WoW is basically single play nowadays, if you want to). I hope they will come around, but I don't really think they will.

To put them in the game, the company had go back and redo huge parts of the older lands, since the developers wanted the game to look good no matter where you were flying over it, Pardo recalled.<br />
<br />
“That was a lot of work for the artists,” Pardo said. “But they did it.”<br />
My memory might be a little fuzzy but I thought that flying in Azeroth wasn't possible until it was introduced in Cata? If so, it's hard to believe that they would spend so much time redoing the older maps for TBC launch. :p</div></div><hr />

Honestly though, I like the ghostcrawler tweets because it seems he tries his hardest to say, &quot;Yeah we fucked up and WoW sucks&quot; without coming out and saying that and burning bridges.

I liked WoD a fair bit, but I quit and will come back for legion, play for a few months, and then quit again, coming back for big patches. I feel zero concern about that and I think a lot of the people subbing and unsubbing aren't super mad that the game isn't perfect, they're getting it, having fun, quitting, and then coming back later. Like I do that with plenty of single player games like Minecraft, so doing it with WoW seems fine.<br />

<br />
You can say that 'I didn't like Diablo 3', but saying 'Diablo 3 failed very hard' is objectively false. 20 million copies sold in 2014 and it's been getting stronger since then, and all the critical reviews of it were good at launch and most places continue to report on the new patches adding more and more stuff all the time.<br />
<br />
Hearthstone is a pretty cool game that I don't play but certainly has a lot of interesting bits and polish. TF2 wasn't the first team shooter, so that point's pretty hilarious on it's face, and SC2 is still a huge esports game.</div></div><hr />

Yes. Before it was illegal. Now it's legal.<br />
<br />
It's not P2W. Nothing is P2W. Even if you buy a 1 trillion DPS weapon, that's not P2W, because you can still lose. It's P4A: pay-for-advantage.<br />

The lore of Diablo, Starcraft, Warcraft has been butchered beyond belief, they are no longer engaging or fascinating. (And yes i own and have completed all those games till the end) Comparing the latest Diable 3, Starcraft 2, WoD to the original, you can clearly see that the stories are losing heart. <br />
<br />
We both agree though that the art department is smashing it out of the park for every game, they are doing a fantastic job at creating the world and immersiveness. The gameplay designers as well as the writers are the ones pulling everything back. Please get some better writers blizz!!! Diablo 3 was the worst story ever, Leah which was suppose to be an important character, i felt zero connection and could care less about how she ended up!! Starcraft 2 was medicore at best (had some brilliant moments but overall fell flat on its face) lets not talk about the wow lore at all &gt;&gt;</div></div><hr />

How about a 25th Anniversary WE'RE SORRY edition?</div></div><hr />

Why do you deserve something because the company has been there for 25 years?<br />

lol good luck with that, I asked the Magic 8 Ball for an unbiased opinion the result came out as &quot;Your chances are unlikely&quot;.</div></div><hr />

And calling people infantile doesn't make you look smart, but I guess that's what the WoW community today is all about. You can't discuss a topic without someone trying to be a badass.<br />

you really are dense aren't you, the other links linking to sister sites are a way for them to &quot;advertise&quot; without &quot;advertising&quot; and also gives people who may be interested in that content an easily accessible way to view that content by having it appear as a click away from what they would normally already be viewing.</div></div><hr />
