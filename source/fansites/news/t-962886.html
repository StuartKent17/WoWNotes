Now that Gamescom is over the last few interviews are popping up with a few interesting details. (via Digitalspy (http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/interviews/a336307/world-of-warcraft-interview-blizzard-on-post-cataclysm-patch-43-and-more.html), GameInformer (http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2011/08/19/blizzard-looking-to-make-quot-meaningful-difference-quot-in-world-of-warcraft-expansion-timing.aspx), Allvatar (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iguHmEb1wts&amp;feature=channel_video_title), and JudgeHype (http://worldofwarcraft.judgehype.com/index.php?page=commentaires&amp;n=125091))<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3+<br />
<br />
The new 5 man dungeons will help to introduce the Deathwing Raid.<br />
The current plan with the Deathwing raid is to have it all available immediately upon release.<br />
The Deathwing raid will be smaller than Ulduar with many phases or encounters with Deathwing.<br />
Patch 4.4 will bring a world event before the next expansion.<br />
The next expansion should be released with a &quot;meaningful difference&quot; in release timeline compared to previous expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
Future Changes and Features<br />
<br />
Paid Guild Transfers are still in the works.<br />
Battle.net account wide achievements are still in the works.<br />
Armor dyes are unlikely to be included in the game, but mount customization is a possibility. <br />
Class Quests are unlikely to return due to the amount of time it takes to design and implement them.<br />
No gold sinks are coming soon because of the large variance in the amount of gold players have.<br />
A real money Auction House is not planned for WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
Other Notes<br />
<br />
RealID LFD grouping was originally going to be paid because of the similarity to Paid Character Transfers, but they decided it was the right thing for the game to offer it for free.<br />
Cross realm RealID grouping is going to be expanded to cover Battlegrounds as well. Depending on how well that works it could be expanded to raids and rated battlegrounds.<br />
There has been a drop in gold farming because phishing and hacking accounts is more profitable.<br />
New players are still having trouble with the first 30 minutes and five levels of the game, more hand holding is coming for very basic concepts like moving, questing, fighting, and looting.<br />
Blizzard did a lot to save time while getting Cataclysm finished, but ended up happy with the final result. <br />
The shared 10 and 25 man lockout has had both positive and negative effects, it solved the need to do both every week but removed some extra content that could be done every week. Some changes will be made in the future to make everyone happier with the solution.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Transmogrification of Heirlooms<br />
I'd like to provide an update on this statement I made. It turns out that Heirlooms will be eligible targets for Transmogrification. Also (and this applies to all Transmogrified items), trading, mailing, auctioning or depositing an item in a guild bank will remove the Transmogrified art, returning the item in question to its original artwork. So, while you won't have to stare at the same old Heirlooms the whole time you're leveling, you won't be able to send a set of Heirlooms that have been Transmogrified with tier 13 art to your level 10 alt. <br />
<br />
[...] Mainhand can only be applied to mainhand, and offhand can only be applied to offhand. This is partially due to the restrictions on certain types of weapon art.<br />
<br />
Again, these are our first tentative steps with Transmogrification, and there's room for modifying the rules later on after the system is introduced, and we see how things shake out. Heck, the rules aren't even quite set in stone right now, and might change further before the system is introduced. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/191485/so-lets-talk-dress-up) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/2973396949?page=21#403))<br />
<br />
Transmogrification as a Gold Sink<br />
The gold cost for Transmogrification hasn't been set in stone, but it's likely to be very similar to Reforging, meaning it'd scale with item level (probably the level of the item actually equipped). (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/191985/transmogrification-the-next-cow-to-be-milked) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3053897324?page=2#27))<br />
<br />
Transmogrification Options<br />
The gear also still has to have stats aside from armor on it. That means that there are a lot of white or grey items that might not be available initially when Transmogrification goes live.<br />
<br />
As an aside, a lot of people have been asking about hiding shoulders, belts, etc. For now, it's looking pretty unlikely that we'll offer the option to hide anything aside from helm and cloak.

KoToR isn't a MMO, so I'm going to assume you mean ToR. On that note, we all know how successful both ToR and GW2 are, seeing as how they've already been released to massive acclaim and lasting appeal.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't Ulduar like the largest raid in wow though? I mean the place is massive. I remember when it launched it took us 20-30 minutes to get to Flame Leviathan. I can't imagine a raid being bigger, but yeah, hopefully as epic!</div></div><hr />

Patch 4.4 will bring a world event before the next expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Any ideas what type of world event? <br />
<br />
This multi-phased encounter w/DW would be cool to me if it were multi phased throughout the entire raid. As in defeat a pre-DW boss, have DW show up and go through some type of build up (RP w/interaction of some sort) to an obvious epic final showdown with DW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do they mean from a lore standpoint(as in will it be like 10 years in the future)<br />
<br />
Or are they hinting it coming out early</div></div><hr />

I was actually wondering if they meant smaller in terms of actual geographical area or smaller as in less bosses? Anyone have any insight, since I don't feel like finding the interview myself?</div></div><hr />

People will find something (anything) to QQ about with this news though. You know, the one's who proudly proclaim how they don't play WoW anymore, yet visit and have 2000 posts on a primarily WoW forum site. Yes, I'm talking about yoooooooouu. *points finger*</div></div><hr />

Hmm, I wonder what this could mean<br />

What I was wondering aswell it could either mean<br />
<br />
In timeline...<br />
<br />
Maybe the will release it sooner?<br />

Or maybe they mean that the timeline will be different as far as story goes. Like 10 years in the future?</div></div><hr />

Vanilla had a multitude of class specific quests that were great and tons of other content for everyone. Blizzard, you're still running a game that has millions of subscribers. I know you're shipping your resources elsewhere in preparation for other products but your laziness is evident in the anemic content you shove out with each patch. As are the consequences.</div></div><hr />

Will probably be much like the pre Wrath event, with our next antagonist announcing his/her/their intentions. Maybe as well the Pandaren coming back into society?</div></div><hr />

The Deathwing raid will be smaller than Ulduar with many phases or encounters with Deathwing. Patch 4.4 will bring a world event before the next expansion. The next expansion should be released with a &quot;meaningful difference&quot; in timeline compared to previous expansions. Multiple encounters with Deathwing? And an earlier news post said we'd be riding Deathwing. And there is no confirmed location for the DW raid yet... Crazy Theory: We ride Deathwing from boss to boss. Surviving the ride is an encounter. Curious about the Patch 4.4 and 5.0 stuff, but I'll wait for 4.3 before I get too excited about it.</div></div><hr />

Using 4.4 as the pre-expansion event seems a bit strange, usually they happen in the X.0 patch... maybe it's just a big event for this expansion with only slight lore for the next expansion.</div></div><hr />

For a game maker, they are one in the same. What you're trying to do is determine what definition of &quot;is&quot; they are using. Further, they made the game sooooooooo easy and dumbed down, that only 28 guilds have actually fully cleared all the content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if said &quot;meaningful difference&quot; allowed them to go through and fix up some of the still-broken parts of Cata. Most notable I can think of off the top of my head are finishing construction of Orgrimmar and putting out that damn fire on top of Stormwind's gate from Deathwing (that is some fire, lemme tell ya). Or maybe they'll just leave it like that for the hell of it, I dunno.<br />
<br />
Each expansion has pushed the timeline in WoW forward about one year or so (there's not a very concrete timeline out there, but pieced together, Classic took place 4 years after WCIII, BC 5, WotLK 6, Cata 7). A &quot;meaningful difference&quot; would have to be quite a bit longer than that. I doubt it'll mean a revamped Outland (especially since they just revamped a major portion of the game in Cata), but it wouldn't hurt. Still, we'd need a new storyline reason for going to Outland, and by extension Northrend, to justify a remake.<br />
<br />
As for the rest, sweet. Sad to see no class quests are planned. I feel like those would allow you greater connection to your character, giving you a bit of understanding as to why a shaman is a shaman, or a paladin a paladin, or a rogue a jerkface (I keed). And I hope mount customization becomes a reality. I'm already curious as to how creative people are going to be with their transmogrification; doing the same to mounts would let you get even more so!<br />

A meaningful difference compared to other expansions doesn't necessarily mean a push forward. If the next expansion starts the moment Deathwing dies, I call that meaningful.</div></div><hr />

This multi-phased encounter w/DW would be cool to me if it were multi phased throughout the entire raid. As in defeat a pre-DW boss, have DW show up and go through some type of build up (RP w/interaction of some sort) to an obvious epic final showdown with DW.<br />

<br />
Honestly, they need to put in a lot more handholding to help people learn the various nuances of the game.<br />
<br />
For instance, a month ago I started leveling a Mage alt. At about level 40, I encountered a hunter in LFG that was wearing half grey items, a white vendor staff, and rolled need on cloth pieces. He/she/it actually passed on the true hunter items that dropped, including a pair of mail shoulders that the hunter DESPERATELY needed. I won the greed roll for it and I forced it onto the hunter and the whole party waited until he equipped them.... and for the rest of the run, we tried to coach the guy on how to gear himself.<br />
<br />
That kind of thing is a fluke.... it's rare that people would bother take the time to teach someone how to gear themselves. Maybe 99.5 times out of 100 people would've just votekicked that hunter.<br />
<br />
Blizzard desperately needs to put in a class-by-class tutorial for each time you create a new character of a particular class, with an explanation of what kind of gear you want to aim for (with the quests appearing again when you hit level 40). Blizzard also needs to do a pass over the gear available in Outlands to rework dungeon drops and quest rewards to better accommodate for the gearing needs of shaman/druids/cloth DPS.<br />
<br />

<br />
Wise indeed. The more I think about it he more I realize how true that statement holds. Its completely obvious with the addition of all these silly features like mobile AH and the Blizzard store and I fear that despite resources being allocated to each separately the gaming aspect is being detracted from in order to provide more features.

<br />
They have this for the new troll starting quests, maybe not as useful as he could be, but he does kind of give out hints and follows you around. <br />
<br />
I feel bad for this source of updates, the lack of class quests, just shows that somehow they have less resources than vanilla than they do now, how is that possible? I think that they should put more emphasis on fun things to do with smaller amounts of people rather than 1 big event to do with 10 or 25 people. As the game wears on, there will be less and less people that care about the story, about raiding and serious raiders will adopt games that have more challenging raids and game mechanics.<br />
<br />
They need to think of a secondary strategy to cater to smaller groups of players that don't have as much time to invest. Raids are fun, but how many times can you go through Firelands in 1 tier? It would be nice to have twice as many 5 mans that offered a varying amount of challenge, so you could have a ridiculous 5 man that was so hard you needed 5 really good players to beat it, etc.</div></div><hr />

Was this post edited or something after the initial posting? It states quite clearly that the difference is to the &quot;release timeline&quot;, not any kind of in-game timeline. I'm guessing this means Blizzard are planning to stick to their promise of &quot;smaller expansions, faster&quot;. However, the amount of success they've had sticking to their &quot;smaller patches, faster&quot; commitment leaves me doubting it. I'm going to guess that the Deathwing raid is going to be with us for a looong while before Mists of Pandaria is released (and with their talk of final raids, quickened releases of the next XPac and such I don't think there can be any doubt that Mists of Pandaria is the title of said XPac, not some side-project). Overall, I think Cataclysm has been an interesting experiment. Blizzard made quite a few mistakes with it - but I'm willing to bet they have learned from these mistakes and I'm quite looking forward to seeing how they implement those lessons in Pandaria.</div></div><hr />

The gear also still has to have stats aside from armor on it. That means that there are a lot of white or grey items that might not be available initially when Transmogrification goes live.<br />
Oh come on ! There is no actual leather gear that I would like for my Nifght Elf Druid more than the Suncured Set :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple.. Titan. Blizzard openly admitted their core talent has moved from WoW and onto Titan. That's where the main people are working now. But I sometimes wonder. They have the time to re-do 1-60 for Cataclysm but can't insert some class quests. Hmm. I guess they have to prioritise and class quests just aren't on the list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Disappointing. I was hoping that after the Deathwing raid there would be one final raid involving N'Zoth.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm has been a huge failure imho compared with TBC and WOTLK and I can't help but feel short changed.<br />
<br />
I'm not really fussed with the lack of raid content as it seems the in thing to give less and less with each passing xpac.<br />
<br />
But the lore and story lines have been rubbish and have not engrossed me at all. Where's the villains at? In TBC you had a raft of villains and their mottly crews ready to wage war against you. In Wrath, LK popped up all the time giving you the sense he was the king of the jungle, the Yogg and Ulduar story, Blue Dragonflight, Yrykul (forgive spelling), Nerubians and Anub (albeit no underground zone disappointment), sheesh even if it was the worst raid in the game argent tournment at least had a story behind it.<br />
<br />
Excluding the Sundering, Cata has given very little, arguably due to have so few new zones. I'm not against re-hashing content and personally feel some old raids and dungeons have a place in new content, but Nef and Ony (seem them before), Ragnaros (hi again), new Mount Hyjal adailies (didn't we do this when levelling at 80), oh, let's pick on the trolls again (those dammed trolls, ethnically cleanse them. But if you are desperate for a story, include some trolls, and finally Deathwing. The deadly Deathwing, i'm going to fart my way out of Deepholm, caused some tsuanmis, few cracks in the earth, say Hi to Raggy, then spend the rest of the xpac flying around hoping some moron stands in my fire. He sucks as a villain. At least Chogall and his twilight crew were getting up to mischief and had a sense of story behind them.<br />
<br />
I cannot help but feel that it is purely commercial decisions pushing these timescales. Not the love for story, of player base to give more exicting and enthralling content to play. Purely some nub in a blue suit in the board room has said, <br />
<br />
&quot;We have 3 mean titles coming out towards the end of the year and we need a way to counter them, and stop lots of subscribers leaving. Titan is not ready and will not be for a while. You got to release the Deathwing raid, and some other gimmicks (like transmorgrification and void storage). That way, raiders will feel obliged to continuing subbing to ensure they kill Deathwing, casual gamers will have the delights on the new raid finder to troll old raids to make their toons look shit hot. Hopefully, the new releases will not have such a massive hit on the subscriber base. By the time Deathwing is old new, we'll release a new and brilliant xpac to pull all the subscribers back and ensure people carry on playing, hoping we ride out the next gen mmo's waves&quot;.<br />

Don't get me wrong i'll be trying both SWTOR and GW2(Best looking upcoming MMO Gameplaywise) but i certainly don't see any of them capable of harming WoW whatso ever. Especially SWTOR it just doesnt do anythnig groundbreaking at all.<br />

OT: Sounds like we will be getting a new expansion in Q2 2012 xD I'm certainly excited and I can't wait for 4.3 to hit PTR so I can play on their whilst I wait for it to go live. I'm pretty much bored of Live servers atm other than doing Arena. I don't do PvE at all.<br />

I'm guessing that they mean that it's not like &quot;Well, 1 year in terms of lore has passed, but guess what? That tower that's being fixed infront of Org still isn't finished&quot;. I guess it means that it'll be like &quot;We want the timeline to fit with the changes of the world&quot;. So maybe we'll see the Park fixed sooner than we'd think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm so glad people like you don't get your way. If you did we'd be able to buy level 85 Characters from Blizz with full raid tier/pvp sets right? Thus rendering the game pointless for levelling or getting to know your class through Playing it.<br />
<br />
Paid Race/Faction/Server change is understandable and im sure most have used the service due to their own reasons. But Class change is just ridiculous. And should never be included in any game let alone WoW.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AetherMcLoud</div><div class="date">2011-08-23, 08:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard desperately needs to put in a class-by-class tutorial for each time you create a new character of a particular class, with an explanation of what kind of gear you want to aim for (with the quests appearing again when you hit level 40). Blizzard also needs to do a pass over the gear available in Outlands to rework dungeon drops and quest rewards to better accommodate for the gearing needs of shaman/druids/cloth DPS.<br />
<br />
Bleh. Like they'd read here. :(<br />
<br />
Well the class description in the character creation window clearly mention what each class is capable off, what armor class it wants to wear, and nowadays even what stats they want. I'm not at my home pc now to check but IIRC it says stuff like &quot;Priests are the masters of healing, but can also deal damage by harnessing shadow power, etc. Priest wear cloth armor and their primary attributes are Intellect and Willpower.&quot; and &quot;Hunters form a bond for life with their beast companions and deal damage with Bows and Guns. They wear Leather armor, and later Mail armor. Their primary attribute is Agility.&quot;<br />
<br />
So I would think by just READING those, new players should already get a nice overview of what armor a class should wear, and what stats it values. Are new gamers these days really that &quot;bad&quot; (for the lack of a better word, maybe &quot;uneducated&quot; would be better...)? Or do they simply lack reading comprehension and have ADS so they just click them shiny buttons without reading anything?</div></div><hr />

This really has my interest, I guess we'll find out what it means eventually. I wonder if it means since Cata will end when all these new MMO's are coming out, they'll bring out the next expansion right away. Can't wait for that!<br />

And apparently you forget that WoW, when it was released, didn't do anything groundbreaking either. The only noteworthy differences it had, compared to its then-competitors, were more quests (almost exponentially so) and no loading screens between zones (e.g., Elwynn &lt;--&gt; Redridge) -- that's it. So, saying you think future MMOs like SWTOR will provide no meaningful competition, when the very game you're championing had virtually the same pre-launch reception, is a bit hypocritical, to say the least.<br />
<br />
On topic: The fact that they keep referring to the next raid as the &quot;Deathwing Raid&quot; kind of has me a bit worried (superficially speaking). Besides &quot;smaller than Ulduar,&quot; (aside from just mentioning Ulduar (*gasp!* He said Ulduar! *Swoon*), what exactly is the point in saying this? every raid in the game is smaller than Ulduar... ), they describe it as having multiple phases/encounters with Deathwing, and this makes me think that... say if it has 6 boss fights/encounters, 5 of them will be Deathwing... in different forms (on his tail, on his back, on his nose, on his chin, inside his mouth), and the 6th one will be at the very beginning, where he - in human form (gotta use that model somewhere other than in the Badlands, right?) - commands his dog Sparky the Smoldering Chihuahua to attack you.<br />
Hell, maybe they can make Sparky roam around the front gates to both Orgrimmar and Stormwind (in both places at the same time!), and whenever someone attacks him, all level 85 players in the attacking player's group/raid are whisked away to some meta elemental plane in the sky (yet under water (but not in water), above the ground, and on fire, all at the same time), and BAM, there's the setting for Deathwing's Raid... (can you hear my eyes rolling yet? lol)<br />
<br />
Wait, doesn't Deathwing die in the latest book, Twilight of the Aspects, anyway? Why the raid? It's been tradition that whatever happens in the books doesn't happen in-game... o.O<br />
<br />
Anyway, 4.3 is at least 6 months away, I'd guess (they're still working in the planning stages of Mogging and Void Storage, for example), so they have ample time to rethink their raid plan. Besides, I'm more excited for 4.4 anyway, and for this failed venture of an expansion to be done with. Bring on the Pandaren! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Instead of dancing around with the quoth tags,I'm gonna make a list.<br />
Fucking this! When wow was released it had 2 raids, no pvp, no teamspeak, half the map was blank and auction houses were not linked. Oh no achievements, and glyphs either. guilds were also just chat channels. And in case you forgot, vanilla had no definite storyline. If viewed that way, SWTOR is allready waay cooler than wow.<br />
Bout the raid: I would really like to kill Gallywix(him working with deathwing would explain much) have an encounter like gunship battle(where Garrosh cleaves Varian in half) and IMHO leaving the Twilight Father(who is not the Twilight Prophet we don't know anything about) in Stormwind would be a baaad move. BUT yeah it looks like all the bosses will be Deathwing. Encounter one: Human form. Encounter two: Dragon form. Encounter three: Following flying deathwing with gunship. Encounter four: riding on deathwing while he flies to places with Twilight hammer archer and casters who are shooting us. Encounter five: dragon form land fight again.<br />
<br />
No, Deathwing survives. Arygos dies, and so does Krasus(heheheee fuck you Knaaak, your pet is dust). However they still show an aspect voting that is totally inconsistent with the game. They also tell us that Thrall is some prophecied killer of Deathwing(while he scews up a ritual where Bilgwater Goblins are őerforming well) So killing Deathwing will not be the redeeming moment for Varian, Moira, Genn, Garrosh, Gallywix, Lor'Themar, Sylvanas.<br />
<br />
Handholding? oh god, wasn't Zuni and Darnell enough?! And even as a very late arrival(emphais on late) I stil lthink it's stupid that we lost class quest. The journey up the mountain to talk to the earth, and later fire sprit was thousand times more epic than clearing ragefire chasm, or the allways terrible wailing caverns.</div></div><hr />

Well when I spoke of Groundbreaking, I was referring to the fact that SWTOR compared to Guild Wars 2 is not anythnig ground breaking when it comes to the upcoming MMO. To me GW2 looks like the first real Next Gen MMO. Where as SWTOR looks like WoW in the Star Wars Universe. Which isn't a bad thing in my opinion cause I'd like that. But GW2 is looknig to do things so different Gameplay wise and combat wise to the regular MMO's.</div></div><hr />

why does blizzard want to keep people without gaming experience playing wow? if you cant handle the starting zone..lol...you're going to quit the game anyway at laters levels.Why?its obvious.<br />
<br />
Because they are less likely to bitch and moan? The might meander for months in the lower levels all the while paying their dues and consuming content that is paid for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This really has my interest, I guess we'll find out what it means eventually. I wonder if it means since Cata will end when all these new MMO's are coming out, they'll bring out the next expansion right away. Can't wait for that!<br />
<br />
<br />
It's as clear a statement as you'll get that the leaked Product Slate is indeed authentic and still valid, and a Q2 2012 release of Mists of Pandaria is planned.<br />
<br />
This means that we will have 4.3 out around Blizzcon, beta of next expansion in December, 4.4 with the pre-Pandaria event in february/march and next expansion hitting the stores in late May 2012.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paid Guild Transfers are still in the works.<br />
Class Quests are unlikely to return due to the amount of time it takes to design and implement them.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wonder what restrictions there will be on the paid transfers or will this just be an even faster uncontrolled way to kill realms (both source and destination).<br />
<br />
More homogenization. Among my fav quests from yester-year were the aquatic form quests and the benediction priest quest. Did they ever put in a cat form quest or travel form quest? I don't recall.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Other Notes<br />
<br />
RealID LFD grouping was originally going to be paid because of the similarity to Paid Character Transfers, but they decided it was the right thing for the game to offer it for free.<br />
New players are still having trouble with the first 30 minutes and five levels of the game, more hand holding is coming for very basic concepts like moving, questing, fighting, and looting.<br />
Blizzard did a lot to save time while getting Cataclysm finished, but ended up happy with the final result. <br />
<br />
<br />
On point one, the cynics are vindicated, the groupies silenced. On the second, it's for people that haven't played games before. The last, it's obvious. The interim patch 4.0.1 was horribly buggy as was the horribly buggy world event. They were obviously set for a pre-Christmas launch and nothing was going to change the minds of the bean counters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't know if it wants to be funny or dramatic, but fails miserably at both. The author clearly has no idea what he's doing and most likely has no social skills in real life if his writing talent is any indication (the art is decent, however). Compared to the other comics that are featured such as Dark Legacy Comics and Daily Blink, you know what seperates those from TG? They know what they're going for (humor) and they do it extremely well. Please, for the love of God, stop posting Teh Gladiators.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Releasing expansions for the same price with less content doesn't sound very win for anyone but Blizzard. They could keep people playing with content updates rather than expansions that are of less value for the money. Release a legit raid and not some of this BS ToC/Ruby Sanctum nonsense along side a few new heroics and you will keep your subscribers. Releasing a half baked expansion for the same price as a real expansion runs the risk of people just saying &quot;Forget it, im done&quot; and going to play something else. Purchasing the Cata expansion at full retail price has left a bad taste in quite a few people's mouth due to what we are getting out of it in the end. I feel like blizzard should include mouthwash with this next xpac cause its going to be even worse.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocd2effbd770</div><div class="date">2011-08-23, 11:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly, they need to put in a lot more handholding to help people learn the various nuances of the game.<br />
<br />
For instance, a month ago I started leveling a Mage alt. At about level 40, I encountered a hunter in LFG that was wearing half grey items, a white vendor staff, and rolled need on cloth pieces. He/she/it actually passed on the true hunter items that dropped, including a pair of mail shoulders that the hunter DESPERATELY needed. I won the greed roll for it and I forced it onto the hunter and the whole party waited until he equipped them.... and for the rest of the run, we tried to coach the guy on how to gear himself.<br />
<br />
That kind of thing is a fluke.... it's rare that people would bother take the time to teach someone how to gear themselves. Maybe 99.5 times out of 100 people would've just votekicked that hunter.<br />
<br />
Blizzard desperately needs to put in a class-by-class tutorial for each time you create a new character of a particular class, with an explanation of what kind of gear you want to aim for (with the quests appearing again when you hit level 40). Blizzard also needs to do a pass over the gear available in Outlands to rework dungeon drops and quest rewards to better accommodate for the gearing needs of shaman/druids/cloth DPS.<br />
<br />
Bleh. Like they'd read here. :(<br />
That's nice of you and your group... but you do know that it was most likely those &quot;new&quot; players who are at fault for not reading the information provided to them in-game? Not reading the quests, item descriptions, class descriptions, talents, tooltips... Just clicking through the game, following map markers.<br />
<br />
All the info is there, in plain view already - but how can you force people to actually read it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
What good does it do to point out that it's &quot;their fault for not reading.&quot;<br />
<br />
That just comes off as elitism. And the point is that they don't acquire the information/skills necessary to enjoy the game. If they don't read it's because reading's boring and it's human nature to skip that stuff and dive into the gameplay. The failing is on the part of the game to not be dive-into-able.<br />
<br />
For some people, I guess, it's not. For these people, more hand holding is necessary.<br />
<br />
Being elitist about the fact that they should read, which for people like that, is probably a fairly complex task, is rude and unnecessary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Man, ppl really need to show them that heroic modes and 10, 25 aren't diferent content...<br />
<br />
There is no extra content in doing the same thing with 15 extra players... and for sure, no extra content in a boss doing more dmg and with more hp or a extra one-shot spell. We didn't have bosses for only one format (25man or 10man) last expansion.<br />
<br />
Actually, if that means anything, we had &quot;less content&quot; since both legendaries could only be made in 25man. So right now, that means 10man in Cataclysm has &quot;more content&quot; as the staff extra boss for both 10 and 25.<br />
<br />
Every news, things look worse... they've killed the expansion just to get $$ from the next content patches packed as &quot;expansion&quot;, sad. Every time they mention something as &quot;not planned&quot;, the chances are very good they are actually thinking about introducing it, but need a customer reaction, so they mention it... real money AH incoming...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Patch 4.4 will bring a world event before the next expansion. The next expansion should be released with a &quot;meaningful difference&quot; in the release timeline compared to previous expansions. Sounds interesting!<br />

I can actually see DW appearing while you progress the raid as a good thing. Raids where you have 1 room 1 boss trash inbetween layout feels like you are fighting idiots who cannot coordinate an attack. DW throwing one boss after another at you to get rid of you ... makes sence, so fingers crossed.<br />
<br />
That being said, WoW in my mind stats to look uncomfortably much like a zombie cash cow Blizz is milking as hard as they can. It's not about doing a good game, it's about making more money ... the its business arguments ... sry, but I don't care. Ideas from players are shot down for being too expensive to do, while games with 1/20th of WoW playerbase somehow make them no excuses.<br />

i love how they say they are expensive quests to make, yet this is coming from the biggest MMO devs in the world. I've played other MMOs that are way smaller and have time to put class quests in.. and these were MMOs that had 20 classes, not counting the multiple specs they could use. 9 quest lines are really that hard to do? Nope. They proved they could do good when they implimented the Hyjal Dailies, imagine they did that but instead of hyjal dailies, every class got an epic quest chain.<br />
<br />
Guess that when you want to offer class change services, those quests are really a &quot;P.I.T.A&quot;... not to mention that doing all that with less devs than they used to have, probably sucks.</div></div><hr />

What this guy said.<br />
<br />
Yes, it may be fun to have a quest tailored to the specific skills of your class. But as someone else mentioned already: Would you rather have 1 class quest you can do exactly once with one of your toons or ten quests you can do with each of your characters? Okay, the class quest lovers are still going to vote for that one quest, but from an efficiency viewpoint it wouldn't make any sense.</div></div><hr />

How exactly those ppl will keep going later...<br />

<br />
Class change worked very well in FFXI online, you could level all your classes (20 of them) on the one character. If a game is going to introduce something as big as this though they can't introduce it 6 years into the game as it really would be a huge game changer.</div></div><hr />

Back in vanilla ALL QUESTS SUCKED COMPARED TO TODAY. But now look at the DK starter area, that was pretty cool wasn't it?<br />
<br />
Oh 6 year old class quest sucked (apparently you never did the Warlock ones) that means class quests will always suck........this is the dumbest &quot;reasoning&quot; I have heard all week.<br />
<br />
I do NOT like the old class quests because mine (apparently you never did the Warlock paladin ones)ALL sucked; mount quest was boring and just expensive back then. And the gear/spell quests were also not special. Doing a quest that has your friends 15 minutes waiting for you while levelling because you need item/spell X is NOT cool.<br />
<br />
About the DK quest lines: yes, agree, I loved them the first time. However, I see players asking for class quests, not class zones with class factions, class cities and class... You get the point. Also, the DK zone proves my third point.<br />
<br />
Class quests are a huge time sink, with all that money and effort wasted for a single run for just 1 class. And THAT is my real problem with class quests.<br />
Why the hell would you make an investment like the DK starting zone for every single class? So we can all play trough it just once? That doesn't seem to be a very good model for an MMO.<br />

<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if said &quot;meaningful difference&quot; allowed them to go through and fix up some of the still-broken parts of Cata. Most notable I can think of off the top of my head are finishing construction of Orgrimmar and putting out that damn fire on top of Stormwind's gate from Deathwing (that is some fire, lemme tell ya). Or maybe they'll just leave it like that for the hell of it, I dunno.<br />
<br />
Each expansion has pushed the timeline in WoW forward about one year or so (there's not a very concrete timeline out there, but pieced together, Classic took place 4 years after WCIII, BC 5, WotLK 6, Cata 7). A &quot;meaningful difference&quot; would have to be quite a bit longer than that. I doubt it'll mean a revamped Outland (especially since they just revamped a major portion of the game in Cata), but it wouldn't hurt. Still, we'd need a new storyline reason for going to Outland, and by extension Northrend, to justify a remake.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrath was released 22 months after BC. Cat was released 25 months after Wrath. &quot;Meaningful difference&quot; means that we won't have to wait two years for the next expansion, meaning that the pandas should be released at some point around may or june, most likely.</div></div><hr />

You're complaining about the blood elf mount quest? That thing was a joke. Kill a few things in EPL. Kill a few things just inside Stratholme. I thought you were complaining about stuff that was actually difficult and or time consuming but you're complaining about the easy stuff. Give me a break.<br />
<br />
It's not like you HAD to do that. You could of course just buy the mount skill at level 60 like your friends did if they couldn't be bothered to help (they obviously like complaining more).<br />
<br />
If you're talking about the alliance hammer quest, every paladin I knew looked forward to it because it was a level 30 weapon that you could get a level 20 with a bit of help. Given how long it took to level then, it was worth every bit of effort.<br />
<br />
BTW who the hell knew you were referring to the blood elf quests when you specifically mentioned warlock in the same breath which implied the original Scholomance/Dire Maul paladin quest?</div></div><hr />

Thanks. Yes, there's a difference between legendary quests and class quests. For one, except for the time sink or RNG aspect, nobody stops you from doing the legendary quest on all your toons.

Oh, I am sorry, I did not know that not all class quests count as class quests? Wait, what?<br />
<br />
Also, yes, it was fun to have an item to look forward too, then again, having to do crappy shit like this while levelling (thus leaving your mates behind) was NEVER fun in my opinion. <br />
Also, the only level 60 class chains I digged were the hunter and priest series, but again, SINGLE PLAYER ONLY (you know what I mean). Yay, two classes. How is that not a waste of time? Try giving me a reply on that, in stead of telling me what class quests I can and cannot complain about.<br />

Not many people get legendaries, especially not the current ones. Real raiders are not the majority, I would say more people did the class quests than raiders doing the legendary chains.<br />

I am just a dude who has fun with the game (yes, including raiding, but I come from a pvp background). All I am actually advocating, a point you seem to miss, is the part where this is a MMOrpg, working as a team and playing together play a huge part in this game. If you want to do stuff alone there are loads of quests and achievements and dailies out there. Wanna do epic single player quests? Just install Dragon Age or whatever it's name is.<br />
<br />
Btw, while we are making assumptions, you are obviously one of those &quot;turn wow into a single player game freaks&quot;. Bah. Get yourself a guild or make some friends on your realm, I achieved a lot of fun and met a few cool people that way over the years. THAT way you can play with others, and then you will no longer need a class quest.</div></div><hr />

No need to tell me there is too much single player content in the game as it is man. You forgot about the goblin starting zone btw, which we cannot even reach. Then again, here we go AGAIN with the ZONES. We are discussing QUESTS here, are we not? How is a RACE starting zone the same as a SINGLE CLASS QUEST CHAIN. This cannot be THAT hard, is it now?<br />
Those 900 are just the tards that yelled that WotLK was to easy and then quit because blizzard listened to them and made raiding and gearing &quot;hard&quot; again (turns out NOT feeding players epics makes them go QQ harder then giving them for free to them). These forums create a HUGE pile of hate (and always HAVE done that) towards the game, especially by people not even playing the game anymore (check the poll from a few days back!). Luckily Blizzard doesn't rely on this site only (altough I am sure that they read stuff), something you seem to do a tad too much.<br />
See, I can make up facts too. Mine are better then yours though. That is a fact.<br />
Well, who is right now? Me? Or you? Probably me.</div></div><hr />

Releasing content patches for Cataclysm is beating a dead horse, since outside of raiding, there is nothing to do. Not a single expansion up to that point was so boring, even Wrath, yesyou would hang in Dalaran a lot, but you would still go do stuff outside of it simply because the content was coherent and connected. Here if I port to Uldum I'm stuck there and the only way to get to another 80+ zone is to heartstone or take a 30minute flight. <br />
<br />
At the moment the shelf boxes of Cataclysm in stores could carry a sticker that reads &quot;Orgrimmar/Stormwind and summon to raid instance.&quot; cause that really describes the state of the game perfectly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unlikely. <br />
<br />
They just focused time revamping the old 1-60 zones for Cataclysm and spent less time developing fresh content for 80-85+ and this is something that can not be easily patched away. That's why they will switch to a new expansion soon which will purely focus on 85-90+(95+) content and this should bring harmony to WoW again. <br />
<br />
There was really no need for a 1-60 zone revamp aside from people wanting to fly there, but they approached it differently changing quests, adding quests, completely changing the layout of some zones, and this all could be level 80-85+ content but instead it's content which really doesn't matter at all for majority of the people who play the game to max the level and do stuff at max level. Imho it was a mistake, I could live without flying in Azeroth and more stuff to do in new Cataclysm zones and most importantly more new zones/raids/dungeons from the get-go.</div></div><hr />

When people talk about class quests they mostly don't mean those &quot;do long quest chain to get skill x&quot; lines (and I agree water totem quest was fucking terrible). They mostly mean the AWESOME epic class quests Hunters and Priests (and to a lesser extent Warriors with Quel'Serrar) had in vanilla Wow. Those were insanely well done especially compared to regular quests at the time.<br />
<br />
Priests had to save countless citizens escaping from Stratholm while the whole group and the priest were bombarded by skelleton archers, and got Benediction/Anathema (which was awesome because it could transform between shadowpriest and healing priest staff, and it's unique model screamed &quot;I'm a priest and I'm fucking good at it).<br />
<br />
Hunters had to kill 4 unique elite demons around the world, where they (AFAIK) had to use all their different skills, one demon had to be kited like hell because he would oneshot you, another had to be trapped, etc.<br />
<br />
Those class quests teached you not only the advanced class skills, they also had epic stories and real rewards.</div></div><hr />

I'm kind of hoping the &quot;meaningful&quot; difference has to do with the fact that we just KILLED the earth warder and as a result it somehow allows the old gods to start creeping out again.

Clearly you know nothing about the art of game design, so I'll educate you.<br />
<br />
Simply put, they add flavor and variety. Things like class-specific (and even race-specific) content do nothing but add value to a game. Even if it's only 10 or 15 quests spread out over 80 levels, it keeps a player interested, because in their mind they're seeing content specifically made for them (&quot;oh shit, the Silver Hand suspects demons are masquerading as fellow paladins?? what can I do to help?&quot; or &quot;Garrosh wants to know what Sylvanas is really up to, but he won't trust anyone but a fellow orc.&quot; (the latter could also be interesting if it were only made available upon honored/revered rep, but I digress) ). And if the stories are well-composed and compelling enough, maybe they'll want to see what the stories are for the rest of the classes and/or races (which, in business terms means they play more and they play longer, and as a result, the business makes more money).<br />
(Additionally, as an ancillary benefit, it would also work towards preventing those who like to reroll new toons from wanting to gouge their eyes out from the sheer amount of linearity the current incarnation of quest flow practically forces...)<br />
<br />
Although, seeing as you have such a big problem with any quests that are specific to a certain class, I suppose you also share the same distaste for racial starting zones, and maybe even Horde- and Alliance-specific quests as well, seeing as how they prevent half of the player-base from experiencing the content and all (the horror!). Perhaps we should just reshape the world - again - and instead of continents and zones, just make it one giant sandbox (literally). We'll make every new character spawn in the exact same location, regardless of affiliation (in fact, why not just get rid of all affiliations whatsoever), and have access to all the same groups of quests. After all, that's the most efficient way to design a game, right... :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
In closing, it's a very good model for an MMORPG. It seems you're looking for something, though, that questing just doesn't provide. (Seeing as how all (non-repeatable) quests can only be consumed once per character, proper class-specific quests would be no different as every class would have them.) <br />

So now I hate quests because I do not like quests you can only do on your own? I did the bloody classic Loremaster achievement, I do not mind quests, I just do not want them to be force fed to me during levelling while others cannot do them (like a lot the classic class quests). Nor do I want Blizz to add more single player content, is that a problem? Can normal quest chains we all can do together NOT ever be as fun as a quest chain only a certain class can do? How? Why? I for one had a lot of fun doing the Thrall chain with some friends. Make those quests Blizz, make millions of them, but PLEASE, do NOT make them CLASS SPECIFIC (let alone single player, like the classic quests!), so I can play with my friends. And hell, being able to play with friends is the first thing that should be doable in an mmo, otherwise, it is NOT an mmo.<br />
Oh, btw, telling someone he cannot like RPG games because he doesn't like the way class quests worked is just plain silly. I do not like this ONE little type of quest, so I hate them all and I should not be playing the game? Rubbish.</div></div><hr />

You forgot about the goblin starting zone btw, which we cannot even reach. Then again, here we go AGAIN with the ZONES. We are discussing QUESTS here, are we not? How is a RACE starting zone the same as a SINGLE CLASS QUEST CHAIN. This cannot be THAT hard, is it now?<br />
Those 900 are just the tards that yelled that WotLK was to easy and then quit because blizzard listened to them and made raiding and gearing &quot;hard&quot; again (turns out NOT feeding players epics makes them go QQ harder then giving them for free to them). These forums create a HUGE pile of hate (and always HAVE done that) towards the game, especially by people not even playing the game anymore (check the poll from a few days back!). Luckily Blizzard doesn't rely on this site only (altough I am sure that they read stuff), something you seem to do a tad too much.<br />
See, I can make up facts too. Mine are better then yours though. That is a fact.<br />
Well, who is right now? Me? Or you? Probably me.<br />
<br />
Wait what?<br />
<br />
10 Class quests are worse than entire starting zones? What? Everyone has a class, not everyone leveled a worgen or goblin.<br />
Face it, class quests are flavor and Blizzard is contradicting itself left and right. <br />
<br />
Cataclysm had many flaws, Tol Barad alone was a ****ing desaster and so is Archeology. That they wont do anymore class quests has nothing to do with being hard work or that is is counter productive (again, every class gets these quests) they just want to make as less content as possible for maximum profit. We will see how many more people leave and if they were all &quot;retards&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I'm kind of hoping the &quot;meaningful&quot; difference has to do with the fact that we just KILLED the earth warder and as a result it somehow allows the old gods to start creeping out again. The event could start off nice and creepy/small with people hearing ingame whispers all throughout azeroth and progress with people going mad.zomg never tought about this then pandaren come with a special pandaria made ward to make people sane again and to proteect horde and alliance city in a mist that the old god arent able to see trought...........Pandaren are said to predate Night eles they probably have encoutnered and fought oldgod themselves and could and the fight with them so they just decided to hide forever being in children's tales and among myth FUCK YES MAKE IT HAPPEN<br />

Your expectation are too high, wwe will most likely have a 4-5 boss( this is what I expect it will be only 3 to piss me off) CoT war of the ancient, and a 2 boss dungeon (like FoS) And a 2 boss 1 room 1 hallway one deathwing dungeon :D lol<br />

<br />
<br />
They don't have release dates like a lot of MMOs, it has no impact on rather the player will play it or not, if they are waiting for it and preordering already then they will be playing it, the point is with games like ToR and GW 2 making much more inovating quest lines and stories for your particular character, it is going to cause blizzard to lose out on subs to games like this, because they do not want to take the time to try anything difficult or challenging.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard can not or will not take the time to do anything as simple as Class Quest. then they probably will not take the time to do a lot of other things that need to be done.<br />
In the end all to be all, making leveling easier and easier for one, does not make a player better, that makes them reliant on hand holding and never getting over a challenge, and to make players better in the end once they hit 85 blizzard should be challenging them with things, and class quest could have been one of the biggest tools into helping a player learn, its sad they will never see that or take advantage of that.<br />
<br />
PvP specs, so if blizzard will not do something as simple as Quest creation, then I doubt they will take the time to actually flesh out a pvp spec specific for PvP only, so that PvE never gets nerfed hard for some classes and imbalancing them across the board. In cata they have done an awful job at this and it is because of PvP nerfing the classes on the board of dps numbers are so far in between each other that it makes it so flavor classes are more wanted then others.<br />
<br />
I raid PvE and do PvP In all its forms, so the thought of never seeing a decent tune for this, I think it will be one of the biggest factors to make me quit.<br />
<br />
Also I don't see there being any more out door bosses AT ALL, since its been clear like that since BC, I do not see any good complicated quest lines that challenge coming at all, Catas quest lines were the same old fashion pick it up and kill it quest, the only &quot;hard&quot;One was the puzzle solve in the hyjal portal area, that was it. All that money they make and them having a lack of show for it, just really burns me.</div></div><hr />

We are not talking about previous quests but about new ones. I would really like to see/do something new when I level my priest alt after my warrior main. Class quests could actually be a good investment for developpers because this would encourage rerolling and with just some class quests some of their customers would spend a lot of time rerolling instead of quitting the game, bored.</div></div><hr />

1. The quests auto accept for you meaning that when you are used to accepting your own quests it will make a negative buzzer sound. <br />
2. There isn't enough bag space. You essentially pray for a bag to drop so you can loot everything and not have to go back to town to sell every 10 minutes. <br />
3. The money rewards you earn from quests aren't enough to pay for your talents. I found this at Level 15 in particular, where I needed around 64 silver to pay for my bear tanking talents and the total moneys I had from quest rewards and looting stuff was around 20 silver. I had someone run us through Wailing Caverns and then I was able to get enough coin plus stuff to sell for the talents I needed. <br />
4. The RAF restrictions not being lifted for up to 72 hours after initiating it are highly, highly annoying. Especially not being able to trade or get BoA's from the mail. <br />
5. The quest rewards are crappy grey/white gear, further causing a new player to join a battleground at Level 10 to get smoked because the gear has no stats on it at all. <br />
6. The starter quests are still &quot;Kill 10 boars&quot; type of quests. <br />
<br />
So I believe it's not hand holding that is what's needed. It's something meaningful in terms of rewards that are needed.</div></div><hr />

The only things that were great about the zombie invasion was getting to see Orgrimmar and Stormwind getting attacked, and Horde &amp; Alliance players being able to chat with each other if you were a ghoul.

If they don't read it's because reading's boring and it's human nature to skip that stuff and dive into the gameplay. The failing is on the part of the game to not be dive-into-able.<br />
<br />
For some people, I guess, it's not. For these people, more hand holding is necessary.<br />
<br />
Being elitist about the fact that they should read, which for people like that, is probably a fairly complex task, is rude and unnecessary.<br />
Reading is elitist now? It's a game, it has rules like any. Is saying someone is &quot;bad at Scrabble&quot; or &quot;bad at hide and seek&quot; because they didn't bother to remember rules elitist, now? Where has all the &quot;correctness&quot; lead us...<br />
<br />
For all I know, the players in question may just be little kids (no offense intended, kids are just kids) who are not interested in learning how to play but in running around beating monsters up, and wouldn't read a tooltip or quest text even if forced to. I'm curious what can Blizzard do at this point to help them learn.<br />
<br />
Sure, let them get more handholding, I don't care much either way. It's just that people who are bad at something will stay bad without the will to improve at least at the level of &quot;read what does this button do&quot; - not in a wiki, not manual, but in-game, on the screen the moment you click it. You can hold their hand, but how will you convey your message for people who don't feel like looking at it? Download the data directly into their brains?</div></div><hr />

They are far more profitable to Blizzard as they do not demand anywhere near as much from Blizzard as you do.<br />
You are far more costly and less profitable to Blizzard than they are.<br />

They will not ever interfere with your game, so you don't have to worry about being corrupted or harmed by them in any way.<br />
They are nice people and promise to leave you alone... and they pay the same amount to Blizzard as you do.<br />
<br />
You can hate them all you want and with as much intensity as you want.<br />
Mostly they are too busy to care, and don't get much time to play.<br />

I love people trying to use the world economy as it is atm, to explain the sudden drop of subs to this game. I bet that only a very small fraction quit for that reason.

If the economy was the issue the loss in subs wouldve been falling over more and more over the years, the economy did not just started going bad all of the sudden this year, it has been on a decline over the years.<br />
<br />
What are you going to say when they report 2 million players lost in the 2nd quarter of next year, the economy again? Because there competition is coming up right around the corner, and it is what they are losing numbers to.</div></div><hr />

You don't sound hurt at all &lt;.&lt;<br />
Your post contradicts it self, because from what it sounds like they are spending time and resources on lower levels anyway where they arent spending it on the max level, the one that matters the most. The players who quit after the first 30 minutes, arent going to play any longer then 30 minutes, because if you just nerf the first 5 levels, you cant stop there, you have to nerf everything else and compact it into a small ass area, players like those do not last at all maybe a months sub fee at the max. I am not dissing on any person on any skill level of WoW here, but the people who dedicated the time to get to 85, and still play at the max trivial level are the ones who are more then likey to be constant sub payers.</div></div><hr />

Do they mean from a lore standpoint(as in will it be like 10 years in the future)<br />
<br />
Or are they hinting it coming out early<br />
<br />
A PANDA invasion!<br />
<br />
panda raid bosses!<br />
<br />
panda cooking recipes!<br />

rifts from where pandas came out thirsty for blood!<br />

At first I laughed from your comment then I sadly realized you were correct. Ah well. I guess that's what end game is for, separating the skill from the inept.<br />
<br />
I've read that one of the dungeons introduced with 4.3 will be in the cavern of time. Maybe the &quot;The next expansion should be released with a &quot;meaningful difference&quot; in the release timeline compared to previous expansions&quot; means we will be jumping forward or backward in time in relation to the rest of the game.<br />

Have you already doen the shaman and druid class quest, it was long and fucking boring, never did the quest for aquatic form lamest chain quest ever for th most ugly shit to have ever happened in all man creation , damn that aquatic mount is ugly.<br />
<br />
I feel everyone is free to their own opinion. Personally I think the shaman and druid class quests were great. They may have been a little tedious in getting to the end game but they really gave the player a different experience in leveling one class from another. In that regard I think class quests are a great idea. It makes you want to try another class not just for the different play style at the end game but a different leveling experience as well.</div></div><hr />

Upon first reading about it, the patch seems like something that is well overdew, and its about damn time. Transmogrification, bad name, but what people have been waiting for for ages, 5 man instances leading up to a raid, nice, and this raid is in War of the Ancients? Awesome! Hell, they even added Darkmoon island which its about time for an update on Darkmoon too.<br />
However on further inspection, some of these changes don't sound so good to the point of thinking, WTF were you doing Blizzard? Firstly, I'd like to talk about Transmogrification. Players have been asking for this for a while now, and some think that it should have been implemented at the beginning of Burning Crusade. But when it comes round to it, have Blizzard really done a good job adding it into the game? It is understandable have a price to pay for starting up a void storage, (Which is not the same thing as transmogrification, but they do work together), even if it is a bit much. Players are willing to pay 1000g for it. However, even though its not set in stone, even putting out pictures of 100g per piece of gear in the storage is frankly, insane. What kind of a reaction did they think they'd get from that? That would be 1300g for 1 set (Excluding trinkets and rings). Though people would pay the 1000g to start it up, would they be willing to pay 1300g for 1 set? If somebody wanted to collected all their Tiers, up to T13...? That is a whopping 16900g?? And then what if they also wanted to get Their seasons, that currently being up to S10? Thats another 13000g! That makes a total of 29900g! I, and probably many gear horders, would prefer to get the vial of the sands in alchemy for that much rather than these sets of overpriced gear! Thats for the gear that people like the best, and of course, they will be bringing out more Seasons and Tiers! The standard idea of the actual transmogrification to another piece such as with reforging isn't such a bad idea, as long as its not to expensive. However, they cannot, they just cannot allow use of Season gear in arena. That would be a major blow to players trying to work out what kind of skill level the person has. Sure you can check the health, but they might be stacking stamina. You can't tell whether they're geared in S10, S9, or if you have it on, S2! Please Blizzard, listen to the people, hear what they say!<br />
Secondly, I would like to talk about the raid. I know I, for one, will be glad of another Caverns of Time raid, that it has been talked about it being. However, a raid on Deathwing? WHAT? But were only on patch 4.3? Makes no sense. Deathwing is the thing this entire expansion revolves around, and one of the only ways I can think that you would fight deathwing, is that it is not the true him, such as with kael'thas. In fact, another reason is that possibly you are helping in the battle with the War of the Ancients, but still deathwing is not destroyed. However, if Deathwing is killed in this patch? 7 Patches left in this expansion without the thing this expansion revolves around? Blizzard must have thought this out though, they wouldn't kill of this aspect of death for no reason. <br />
However, if it is just a way to speed up the time till the mentioned 'Mists of Pandaria' expansion, then I am disgusted. 'Mists of Pandaria' sounds interesting, but nothing like this expansion. I have enjoyed this with its dragons and elementals, and it has to be my favorite, just over burning crusade. <br />
They have also been talking about coming out with this new 'Darkmoon Island'? Sounds interesting, but really blizzard? Do you really think this is the best way to spend your time? I expect however this will be the new 'World event' in the next patch. But this is not the best way to spend your time, and it would probably be better thinking up other patches in-between the Deathwing fight and now. Some raids would be nice, possibly with the return of outlandish characters after the transmogrifiers have come along. Velen is starting to get lonely in Exodar :).<br />
To top it all off though... Blizzard... Why... Just... Why... In the next patch they have been talking of adding 'Raid Finder' to the game. In my opinion, this is going up there with one of the worst ideas they have ever come up with. Really Blizzard, Really? For those who are thinking in this current point of time, whats he Nerd Raging about, think of this. You sign up for a raid, fully geared, however you guild aren't raiding right now. You know the tactics and all, and you enter. There are maybe 4 other people that know what their doing, and the rest have no clue. You explain the tactics to them, and about only 2 of them listen. the other 3 fuck the raid up in the obvious and possible ways. Thats not it though. You would get people wanting to leave all the time. You know when you get into a random dungeon and you get one guy go 'Sorry guys, gtg', (Usually with sorry), and just leaves? Well for a 10 man thats X2 people. And for a 25 thats X5. Either because its there least favorite raid, or they actually have to go, this creates a black hole in the raid which people get sucked into and leave. And of course, a lot of people don't have the gear, and its going to be the less geared people who join, not the ones who are in a hardcore raiding guild. So your going to have a group of people who are undergeared, and guarateed to have one guy who has no idea what he's doing. Perfect in the current Cataclysm climate.<br />
Thats not the only problem with the Raid Finder. When the instituted the 'Instance Finder', I think part of the game died. People liked to do instances together, and some still do, but you hardly ever see someone advertising in trade for it. Random people joining for instances would have nothing to lose, apart from a deserter buff that hardly ever works, by leaving the dungeon. People before the 'Instance Finder' were closer together, as they had to stick together to take down a boss. Gear was much more difficult to get. Friendships were made through dungeons. Far less trolls existed behind their 2 walls of protection, those being being on another server, and being behind a computer. With the 'Raid Finder', another part of the game is going to die, and were losing people who advertise for it in trade.<br />
All in all I think the results for patch 4.3 have been somewhat dissapointing. Blizzard is currently on the tightrope of gaming, other games bursting up from the ashes. It needs to be more careful on what its doing, and remember what it is. An MMORPG, where people can make friends, be social, and be close. Not just Gaming. Just Gaming is for RPG's. Do you really want to institute an RPG Blizzard, where the other people in the RPG, which may as well be NPC's, sometimes fail? <br />
If you read down to this point in this page, thanks for reading, and sorry about the rant. Just wanted to get some things clear. <br />
