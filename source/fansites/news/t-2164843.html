I agree. This is a great idea. I personally stopped playing WoW about 2 months ago and I have 2mil++ gold I'd prefer to convert it and get myself some hots skins or other fun stuff for the other Blizzard games I play.<br />
The only downside I can think of is that the EU tokens cost too much gold :(</div></div><hr />

You're buying the store credit with gold, not cash. Just like you're spending the gold on 15$ worth of game time currently, it's not different.</div></div><hr />

You were at the max 36, then it reset after the 24 months? Or it reset and let you go past 36 in less than a year with 7.1.5?<br />

It totally reset. I was at 36 and couldn't buy any for the longest time (also, it wasn't 24 months ago yet). I bought almost 50 more over the last few weeks.</div></div><hr />

:D I haven't decided what I'm going to spend my balance on yet. have 60 right now with 6 tokens in bags and 2 months of subscription active. going to wait and see what the price ends up being. and maybe there will be sales sometime soon. not in a rush right now, that balance is not going anywhere :D (I am kinda sad that it doesn't apply to gear store, cause I was all ready to order Sylvanas and Kerrigan pops!.. but now.. eh.)</div></div><hr />

No cause you wont be able to buy any tokens. we will now see the biggest bot increase in wow ever.<br />
(PLUS wow just turned into a job...) Gotta love all these tears. <br />
<br />
Apparently wow was the best during vanilla, and surprise, surprise, there was no tokens, you had to pay a sub, most of the stuff you could do was grind and bots were prevalent.<br />
<br />
Suddenly when token went live all the entitled kiddies think WOW deserves to be f2p for them for minimal effort. <br />
<br />
Just pay a sub. <br />
<br />

Wow is still cheap for 15$ a month while single player games often cost 60$ and you're done with them under a week with zero replayability value.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because everyone expects a EU release soon, and many want to get a token BEFORE it gets more expensive, by which they actually make it expensive. :D<br />
<br />
Bottom line: I don't think it will be feasible for the average joe to finance WoW via token any more. 120K/months is currently very doable but I won't be surprised if token breach the 500K mark, now that they are useful for A LOT more than gametime.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">OriginZero</div><div class="date">2017-02-06, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's 12$/month if you pay for 6 months as far as I know, instead of 15$.<br />
<br />
This seems like a loop hole, so we'll see.<br />
<br />
No. You cannot set up subscriptions with Battle.net Balance. Subs are only set up with credit/debit cards.<br />
<br />
You can purchase digital gametime cards, which you can get like 180 days for 77.94. So, that might work for you; however, keep in mind that some states charge taxes, so say for example, you were just looking at the 30 day digital gametime card for 14.99, depending on where you live, that could be 16.xx after taxes, so the 15 USD you got from one token wouldn't be a enough.<br />
<br />
So, to get the 180 days of game time, if you live in a place that charges taxes on digital purchases, you'd need 6 tokens (or 384,000 gold, roughly based on current prices). No taxes means you could do it for 5 tokens (320,000 gold).</div></div><hr />

Token prices on NA have been relatively stable since November, give or take ~10k depending on the time of day.<br />
<br />
Hopefully token sellers will flood the market today, and the prices will plunge, but... we'll see. I wouldn't say we're seeing prices skyrocket yet, but there doesn't seem to be much demand for gold these days, which bodes ill.<br />
<br />
I wish Blizzard would do a bit more to artificially manage token prices. They get $5 extra in profit on each one sold, and the money remains entirely within Blizzard's ecosystem, so you'd think they'd do more to encourage people to buy them. Letting the supply and demand completely dictate the sale price means sellers can withold stock and drive up prices, reducing the total number sold.</div></div><hr />

They hit 65k a week ago, too. Obviously the number is going to continue to climb until stock is replenished or it hits the 24-hour limit Blizzard has in place.<br />

Well, there seem to be a lot of people who don't understand market dynamics. If everyone was intelligent about WoW tokens then we could collectively min-max the supply and demand so everyone gets the best deals.<br />
<br />
However, innevitably, dummies get nervous or impatient and buy or sell way too soon.</div></div><hr />

this is true there are people who are playing for free technically by paying with their gold.<br />

if they can't afford the gold, which they probably won't want to grind 250k a month on EU to play they'll just quit, i don't see how this is a positive to blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
3) People can faction transfer without spending a dime, that will make servers more unbalanced. <br />

We'll see a new ceiling over the next few days. My guess is close to 175k. Could spike to 200k, but over time, it'll drop down slowly in anticipation of the next expansion.<br />

No one can transfer for free. The tokens cost $20. Just because the person using the token to transfer did not pay, doesn't mean it was not a paid transfer. A token transfer costs MORE then a money transfer since Blizzard takes $5 of the token price before loading a Bnet Balance with a Token. A token transfer must gather the gold needed before transferring, that costs TIME for the token user, as well as MONEY for the token seller. Why people think tokens = free stuff is a mystery to me.</div></div><hr />

Why you think people are saying this is a mystery to me..... <br />

No shit it cost $25 to transfer, Someone can spend two tokens and do it. Those who have a huge amount of tokens or gold will do this because for a lot of people they value there money over there time/gold.<br />

I bought the expansions, i bought several months with money already. So i already paid for the game multiple times and I havent said a single word about me in my previous post. But tell me another game where you have to pay a monthly fee after you bought the game itself, furthermore tell me another game which has 6 expansions each lets say 40$ and a 15$ fee for every month for years, because i don't really remember any other game which would cost 500-1000$+ money just to play it without any microtransactions. There are a plenty of more mmo-s and AAA games which only requires to buy for 60$ for a lifetime, furthermore there are a lot of free games for example the most played game : LoL. <br />
I know you can't compare this, and &quot;why am i not playing those then&quot;, because I enojoy this one the most, however it doesn't mean that i need to obey to any conditions what blizz set to just play the game.</div></div><hr />

If you are using gold you just happen to accumulate while naturally playing the game then it basically is free TO THAT PLAYER. now if that player is specifically dedicating time to farming gold then you could say they are paying for it in time spent, but if it just gold being naturally accumulated then it is a different story. a matter of perception really.</div></div><hr />

Once again......NO SHIT. No one is saying this we know the transfer rate is $15 per token. <br />
<br />
That is still only costing 2 tokens to move 1 character and many people will spend the gold/tokens to do it. Dam do try to fallow along a little bit.</div></div><hr />

The token that was bought by person X cost them $20. The person who spend gold to buy the same token only cost them time not $$$$.....<br />

For the person who only spent time to get the token its free for them(via no cost of $$$ on there end). <br />

Yes I can confirm this. Had 10 tokens before it went live and unloaded them all into my bnet.</div></div><hr />

No, it wasn't free. Someone paid $20 for them to use a token.<br />

One of the big things they fail to realize &lt; this is just based off of friends that play and guild members &gt; is A LOT of people play on free tokens and there are many who use tokens that will not pay Blizzard real money again. If tokens go to absurd prices.. they'll just quit. Blizzard has lost the trust and faith of way to many people including myself. Only reason I stick around is well.. literally I play for free and have since the token launched. 25-40k is a reasonable price. 65k+.. for most people isn't viable and I honestly can see their subs dropping even further due to this. They need to imo put a cap on the cost of tokens in game and w/o one.. it's only gonna hurt their bottom line.<br />
<br />
Just another cash grab by their dev team. Due to the terrible devs they have this xpac and the resulting huge decline in subs they are doing what ever they can to filter more cash in.<br />
<br />
I strongly doubt the devs are sitting in their offices thinking, &quot;You know what we should add to the game, tokens you can buy with WoW gold that converts to battle.net balance. Yeah that sounds great!&quot;<br />
<br />
There's a force behind all of this. Assuming the devs were responsible for this is wrong imo.</div></div><hr />

And yes, customers will be getting Blizzard games for free, since time is a commodity that millenials have aplenty, and millenials are the primary purchasers of Blizzard products.<br />
<br />
Now ask Chris Metzen if he can buy a Yacht or a Sandwich off of the time of his customers. The answer is: he can't! Blizzard is basically sending the message that the money just isn't there anymore, and that player retention has reached critical levels of &quot;must improve at any cost&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Time spent getting gold has or had (if you gathered the gold some time ago) a &quot;cost&quot; also, seeing you could also do other (possibly more fun / usefull) stuff in that time, in the end you might even argue that free time is more valuable then money, for some atleast.<br />
<br />
I mean i play this game for fun, so i pay Blizzard €12 euro a month or something to play, for me not a big seal since it costs me less that a hour to make the €12. I rather work +- 160 hours a month, use the money i make to sub tot wow and have fun all the hours i play, than that i work 160 hours a month, and also use valuable free time to grind (which i find not fun, some ppl might though) the gold needed for the 120K or something token a month, especially if the prices will skyrocket now and the gold will take even longer to grind.</div></div><hr />

They have a problem to solve first:<br />
<br />
In the EU store, 30 days is €12,99. Tokens are €20. If they simply 1:1 NA, that means everyone who uses a token directly for 30 days of game-time in stead of converting it to Bnet funds first, tosses €2,01. (Or even more if you consider 90 and 180 days from the store).</div></div><hr />

<br />
No shit it cost $25 to transfer, Someone can spend two tokens and do it. Those who have a huge amount of tokens or gold will do this because for a lot of people they value there money over there time/gold.<br />
<br />
I just dumped all my tokens into my Bnet. If I really wanted to I got enough bnet to transfer 6 characters. <br />
(As a example)<br />

If you valued real money over time and gold you would be working a second job to make more real money instead of playing Wow to make fake money.</div></div><hr />

I was running 2 characters. My main alone easily naturally accumulated enough gold to pay for game time (at the ~60k price point for the last 4 months). So adding in gold accumulated from my alt I was easily paying for my sub without dedicating any time to farming gold. I also got alot of excess gold on my alt by selling darkmoon cards on the AH, so a little time form that buying mats, converting to cards and reselling, but that doesn't even count towards my main's income I am referring to.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what I've done since some time in WoD. I do nothing extra specifically to farm gold and I pay for my game time using tokens. Early in Legion I was going backwards while I leveled up my professions and had to rely on the gold I made in WoD, but now that I am no longer spending a fortune on professions I'm making enough naturally to pay for game time without going backwards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At the current rate it will be far more then double increase every 24 hours :D but yeah eventually they will plateau out.<br />
<br />
Especially since you typically need 2 tokens for a transfer/race/faction change which is likely the most used for WoW (aside from game time)<br />
<br />
I really wonder what effect it will have on the rest of the WoW AH long-term.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure in a few days you can become super rich ingame by selling tokens bought with real money. But what's there to buy with that gold? A spider mount for an obscene amount of gold, and some old mounts everyone that's played a while, already has.<br />
<br />
There should be more things to buy with ingame gold outside the store, if we're to make selling tokens more appealing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No idea who buys them and why but people DO buy them. I have friends in hardcore guilds and they sell everything, m+, karazhan, raid boosts, achievement runs and so on.</div></div><hr />

And then presumably the people in those guilds spend the gold from their boost-selling to buy tokens to cover their sub, and the cycle of life is maintained. ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Found the answer to my question.<br />
<br />
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/19823808/wow-token-additional-details<br />
<br />
This has probably been like this since the introduction of the token, but you can buy 36 tokens within 24 months.<br />
<br />
Which means that if you are like me and you plan to buy a token for gametime every month, ongoing, within those 2 years I would be able to buy 12 tokens extra for battle.net balance. So basically one additional token every 2 months.<br />
<br />
Unless they changed something about it or they reset it with a patch. I wish they would announce those resets, or does that happen every patch? But then the whole restriction seems useless to begin with.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard managers don't understand the meaning of &quot;MMO&quot;. If people stop subing that means there will be less players --&gt; less players means less groups and realms will start to feel empty so other people will start to unsub too.<br />

<br />
That was the case already. You pay 20€, you get one month of gametime. One month of gametime is not worth 20€, it's worth 13€ here. So I would even expect the token to convert into 13€ of battle.net balance, otherwise there'd be no reason to ever convert it into 30 days of gametime. If it gave 15€, you'd be better off converting it into battle.net balance and then buy 30 days of gametime for 13€, leaves you with 2€.</div></div><hr />

It has to crash and Blizzard has to respond because there is at least 5 times bigger demand than supply. Soon there will be no tokens for players only BOTs with 10nano sec reaction time can buy tokens.<br />

The question is whether or not higher token sale volume is sustainable, and what indirect effects would result from so many players quitting.<br />
<br />
For example, if half a guild consists of token-subbing players and enough of them quit, the guild might collapse leading to other players to quit as well. All of those players might have been the type to spend real money on special mounts and pets, so that revenue is lost as well. Tokens could easily create a brief window of increased profit, but after sales normalize result in less money for Blizzard due to lost players.<br />
<br />
That's all speculation though, I don't think anyone without a time machine or psychic powers knows what will happen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, when the first people start to really throw their tokens on the market it will decrease quickly again...cause everyone who wants to get the max gold for his money will have to buy the tokens for money now. Not sure if this was the max peak or if it will reach another peak once the feature goes live in europe...but fact is: Once the initial demand is covered the price will go down again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Djem</div><div class="date">2017-02-07, 05:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The price of EU WoW Token has started to sharply decrease. It’s now at least 4K lower than the peak of 200,628g.<br />
Because a lot of people saw the 200k mark and thought it was the right time to sell. Once enough people did that, the price dropped because of it, which compelled more people to sell before the price drops even more. This will pass, especially when the feature actually goes live in EU tomorrow and demand increases again.<br />
<br />
Not that any of it matters. These are just the initial reactions of the market. What truly matters is that demand will never again be proportionate to supply the way it was before this change; and even before this change low supply and high demand kept the price on a steady increase. From now on it will be going up for the foreseeable future at an increased rate.<br />
<br />
So, for example, if the token price used to increase by 10k each month before this change (which it did) from now on it will increase by 20k each month on average. That's not counting the 90k spike of today of course, which won't go away.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The prices are set by supply and demand. If a lot of people are buying them but the supply is low the price goes up. When the Battle.net balance thing went live everyone and their grandma rushed buy as many as they could and the price skyrocketed because there weren't enough available. Once they hit 115k people started buying tokens with cash to sell for gold and the price is starting to drop again. It will stabilize eventually but it will probably never go as low as 60k again.</div></div><hr />

Btw, I started playing wow in TBC, because my friends who played since vanilla invited me to join them. Guess what, there was no token back then and both me and my friends are Polish and that didn't prevent us from playing, even though the basic wage in Poland equaled to 200-300 euro. They quit at the end of WOTLK though but that had nothing to do with not being able to afford the sub, rather the combination of moving on with RL + other more interesting games out there + WC3 TFT arc being closed with WOTLK. <br />
<br />
Most people who claim they quit wow because they can't afford token are people who treat wow as a f2p game they just have on their desktop but don't care much about. I played League of Legends for quite some time before I quit, I was on EUNE server and I saw firsthand how toxic can be a community in a game just because that game is f2p and people don't give a damn about their accounts, if banned just make another &quot;smurf&quot; and continue. <br />
<br />
Hearthstone is another example, one reason why there is no chat and only emotes during a match. 90% of friend invites after a match are just because some salty dude wants to tell you how he will f*** your mom and a list of expletives before removing you.<br />
<br />
On the other hand while I didn't play FF MMO (no time to play more than 1 MMO seriously really), I heard positive opinions about its community while the game is sub based. <br />
<br />
All of these make me think WOW is better off as a sub-based game rather than a game that &quot;theoretically has a sub but you can pay it off with gold with barely any effort or knowledge about game economy so it's negligible&quot;. If the sub cost could be paid off by 1 afternoon of effort (like herbing) for the whole month of forgetting about it, or passively by just sending order hall gold missions, then it was definitely not something expected to last forever. <br />
<br />
Also let's not forget most casuals have 0 gold expenses in this game except repair bills. They don't need gems, enchants, flasks, pots, augment runes, food buffs and all these things that hardcores chug every raid night / high m+ session, therefore perpetuating the game economy. Casuals can just sell everything they find.</div></div><hr />

I don't mean to be trite, but your sweeping generalizations callously disregard players I know who are deeply invested in the game despite only being able to sub through tokens. Maybe they're not &quot;most people&quot;, but the way you used that term strongly indicated you didn't believe such people either existed or mattered in the slightest.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they're not &quot;most people&quot;, but the way you used that term strongly indicated you didn't believe such people either existed or mattered in the slightest. I was subbed through tokens as well, but people who are &quot;deeply invested in the game&quot; as you describe can go back to paying sub because they care about the game and because we paid sub for years before token was released. &quot;Only being able to sub through tokens&quot; must be some people who never played before tokens were released or what? People who say &quot;if token goes this high, I quit&quot; just don't think the game is worth a sub, they only tolerate it in f2p edition. They could pay it, but they don't want to. Especially the posts about how they won't give Blizzard their money because they don't agree with some dev decision etc. <br />
<br />
I'm seriously baffled how people just paid a sub for 10 years and then tokens launched and there isn't a single day someone wouldn't be complaining it costs too much gold or begging for gold for token because his gametime is &quot;ending soon&quot;. People are not entitled to tokens and have the game in f2p edition. <br />
<br />
Deeply invested players who played wow for years know it's a sub based game and are used to treat it as such. If you have some sad story of sudden impoverishment then it's the same as every other hobby. Can't afford cinema / restaurant / gym / clubbing etc. any more? Unfortunate, but you aren't entitled for free entry just because. <br />
<br />
Those people exist, but are rare, and since Blizzard is a business, not charity, token was never planned as a &quot;welfare sub&quot; but as an extra avenue of profit. <br />
<br />
WOW even when sub based is still a cheap form of entertainment because 1 month of WOW costs as much as 1 evening somewhere else (cinema / restaurant / club etc.) and for example single player games often cost 40-60$ and you consume them in few days, very few last for weeks or have much replayability value. Obviously we're talking here about developed countries because WOW requires stable internet connection which already excludes parts of the world that don't have access to it. <br />
<br />
People who pay gametime through tokens are a minority, among that minority those who can't go back to sub if they wanted are even smaller minority. If people could get gold for token with barely any effort they did so, so they have extra savings to buy another beer or pizza. <br />
<br />
A very dedicated player that is indeed &quot;forced to&quot; use tokens can use their skills to do some homework on WOW economy and find ways to make that extra gold. Many people were just relying on lazy gold like garrisons / order hall missions, farming old raids etc. and then throwing tantrums they &quot;have to&quot; do an extra hour of &quot;chores&quot; to afford rising token prices. <br />
<br />
So generally people have options: <br />
- find ways to make extra gold in wow <br />
- find ways to save 15$ / 13eu a month for a sub <br />
- quit wow because they cba neither of the above (= not a dedicated player) <br />
<br />
Tbh there's nothing wrong with quitting wow because someone doesn't have time any more or just doesn't like the game anymore. What's wrong is people throwing tantrums, empty threats and generally behaving as if token was welfare and they were entitled to receive it. Also making grand claims how high token prices will de-populate wow and so on. I'm sure majority of players does not use tokens, neither sell or buy. Don't have statistics to prove it, just general idea among my friends or guildies most of them don't use either option, only a handful people do. That's why I say, minority. <br />
<br />
Even in countries where you can't use sub, like Greece, because their credit cards aren't internationally usable because of EU financial restrictions, most people buy gamecards from shops instead of using token.</div></div><hr />

If a lot of people are buying them but the supply is low the price goes up. When the Battle.net balance thing went live everyone and their grandma rushed buy as many as they could and the price skyrocketed because there weren't enough available. Once they hit 115k people started buying tokens with cash to sell for gold and the price is starting to drop again. It will stabilize eventually but it will probably never go as low as 60k again.<br />
<br />
True supply based economics are the way it should work. But, we all know that isn't what happened here. Blizzard sets the price, not the market. Blizzard made an announcement, then artificially raised gold prices on the AH to create interest from cash buyers hoping to make huge profits in game. If people were to refuse to pay the price on the AH then Blizz would be forced to either lower the price or make changes to the token system.<br />
<br />
Look at it this way; 48 hours ago 60K gold was equivalent to a steak dinner at Applebees ($20), today 60K gold is equivalent of a value meal at McDonalds ($8).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this will actually have the inverse effect of increasing the value of gold. Everyone freaks out dumps gold on game time increasing the price 100%.<br />
Personally IDGAF. I have millions rotting on servers and I also have a job. $13 a month is a joke. Most of the 12 years I've played I've been paying for 2x accounts anyway. If tokens remain at ~90k I would probably just pay $13 or quit. Game is depressingly bad anyway. Legendaries and loot in general has just removed any fun I used to have playing. I used to think the artifact system was cool/interesting but now I've come to realize it's just a way to shackle us to a specialization and add a few new talent/abilities without making them baseline.<br />
<br />
It basically boils down to whether or not people are willing to pay this new artificially inflated price. 90-100k a month is still probably easy to make, but so is $13-15. With the way things currently are, I'm inclined to play less; not more to try and make up the difference. If they are going to demand double for game time I expect a proportionate increase in the quality and content of the game and I'm not seeing that; just more ways to fish for money so they can add skins to Overwatch (where WoW subscription fees go anyway).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, it did. But once it gets close to that line people started buying the token for gold cause they have been like you....so it went up again at 115k. Watch the same happening when it gets close to 200k today(likely around 190-195k). The question is where it will stand when the extreme ups and downs(due to high demand) are over. The demand should be gone for quite some time...and during the last months the price was only rising due to smart people expecting the demand to go up now(I'm still sitting on 5 months game time here). So it's possible that it will drop quite a bit below the 100k line in march/april.</div></div><hr />

It's never dropped like this before; only ever dropped a bit to skyrocket back up past its previous high point.<br />
This smells like Blizzard have fixed it themselves. Now if only they could equalise the cost across all regions so that my race changes aren't twice as expensive as America.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nah<br />
it's just a logical reaction.<br />
<br />
1) People see this news and suddenly the demand on the tokens skyrockets. <br />
2) Now everyone gets word of the ability to convert money to a lot of gold so a lot of people invest in tokens and put them on sale, or wait for prices to peak. <br />
3) Prices peaked and start dropping due to demand on them slowing down. Either people who wanted them already have the tokens to convert to BNet currency; or they simply find prices to be too high.<br />
4) As a result everyone who still has tokens starts flooding the market seeing as prices are going down again. <br />
5) There is now a huge supply of tokens on the market and the demand slowed down. <br />
<br />
So now it's just waiting for people to start buying tokens again and the prices will go up again.<br />
It's pretty natural to have this eb and flow shockwave effect after a change like this.<br />
<br />
Plus blizzard doesn't really benefit from changing something on their end. It's a supply and demand system, so it will always balance itself. In the end they are always the winners anyway, they just made a ton of profit. No gold is created with this whole process so there is no influx of gold, if anything you're more likely to see a bit of gold flow from rich players to poorer players with IRL cash. It's win-win.<br />
<br />
EDIT: In fact EU prices are rising again. And US prices have already bottomed out; probably going to rise again as well. <br />
It's very likely there will be another &quot;sine wave&quot; in the prices (albeit a smaller one), before it settles a bit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See..and that is why players are stupid. They buy when it is close to the former low. Hence it never really reaches that low again and all have to pay more. Same counts for the peak. If players were smart, we would all wait till it's down to 1k gold(or whatever that lower limit is) and start buying....and those that buy it for dollars would wait till it's at 500k gold(that way you could basicly buy all pets/mounts etc. for a total of $13...and there would likely still be enough tokens cause people want the spider mount for gold or need gold to buy raids/titles etc.). Yes, it would always need several days to reach each limit...but all players would benefit from that. I'd expect Blizzard to interfere tho if the playerbase was that smart. :cool:</div></div><hr />
