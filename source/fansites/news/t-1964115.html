<br />
Note that while this Achievement will not be rewarded retroactively, anyone who leveled a character to level 20 after 19:00 CET on March 11 will be eligible to receive Lady Liadrin.<br />
<br />
Once earned, you’ll be able to find your new hero waiting for you in your Hearthstone collection (My Collection) under the Heroes tab.<br />

<br />
Get on Your Hearthsteed and Ride<br />
If you’re new to the fast-paced card-slinging action of Hearthstone, you can also earn a magnificent Hearthsteed to charge across the battlefields of Azeroth upon.<br />
<br />
This epic flying mount is awash in a mystical blue glow—its rocky exterior just barely manages to contain the power that lurks within! When you’re ready to take to the skies, the Hearthsteed manifests ethereal blue wings, ready to carry you off to your next adventure.<br />
<br />
Getting your hands on this unique flying mount is simple . . . and fun! Just win three games of Hearthstone in Play or Arena mode to earn the Mount Up! quest reward in Hearthstone. The next time you log in to World of Warcraft, the Hearthsteed will be waiting for you in your in-game mail.<br />

Haven't blizzard been doing that in all the games anyway? Aka HOTS portrait in diablo 3, this isn't a new concept. It's more like hey you should check out some other games of ours, you'll get a sweet reward for the game you originally play of ours.

Indeed, I have a HotS mount from Hearthstone and free heroes from Diablo 3, a Hearthsteed in WoW, cosmetics in Diablo 3 from other games, everything has cosmetics crossing over from other Blizzard titles. It's not remotely new and it's not something I've heard people whining about before. Or maybe I have. There are so many whiny little babies on every gaming forum that all the whining just blurs into a single high-pitched noise that I have to try to shut out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would think no since you never leveled to 20. If it's not retroactive then a DK was never level 20.</div></div><hr />

Draw in new players who, if they decide to stay and buy WoD/LGN, become stranded at the ass-end of an expansion with low activity from current players and sky-high entrance requirements to what little group activity is atill ongoing.<br />

<br />
No, this is business. If you have double digit 100's then there is zero sense in offering you something to play the game because you are already playing and enjoying the game. Giving stuff to you is not going to make them any more money and since Blizzard Entertainment is not a Charity (at least the last time I checked) they have no incentive to just give you free stuff for no return. Instead they are inclined to attracted new customers and potential income sources to their business to help them maintain and grow. You need to check your entitlement.</div></div><hr />

If you have double digit 100's then there is zero sense in offering you something to play the game because you are already playing and enjoying the game. Giving stuff to you is not going to make them any more money and since Blizzard Entertainment is not a Charity (at least the last time I checked) they have no incentive to just give you free stuff for no return. Instead they are inclined to attracted new customers and potential income sources to their business to help them maintain and grow. You need to check your entitlement.<br />
<br />
Entitlement.. lol. Just a trite term overused by simpleminded yes-men. Awarding this achievement retroactively would show appreciation for their current customers who have remained despite the lack of content and questionable development choices (now and ongoing). Highlighting that Blizzard is more interested in a revolving door for a community isn't &quot;entitlement&quot;. Grow up.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is trying fish up their quarter numbers for their investors. Even though I know there are players that really will do this because they are completionist and cater to Blizzard. We as the majority should just turn our eye and ignore this. Its been almost 9 months of no new content. No new 5 man dungeons, raids or battlegrounds. A horrible expansion. They are still in Alpha in Legion. The pre-event has not been released yet. Legion will not have no new battlegrounds but instead rehashes of Ashran, Tol Barad and Wintergrasp. 4 zones with a leveling of about 8 hours. This game is getting worse and worse everyday. Don't give into this promotion because if you do, you are responsible as to why this game has been crap for the past 2 years. If I can convince 1-1 million or even more players about what they are doing then I did my job.<br />
<br />
If you want think about this a little more. We the players has made Blizzard Billions of Dollars by playing World of Warcraft. Now they are shitting on us by focusing all there time and energy on Hearth Stone, Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm. We should refrain from playing those games as well. They dont care anymore about the World of Warcraft community. They even went as low as to patch Diablo 2 and Warcraft 3 2 decades after they were released. They should have revamped those games and gave it to there costumers for free. What the hell are they doing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
One hero for doing a raid, one hero for being rank1 in hots, one hero for something diablo 3 related (sorry i dont play diablo so i dont know what to put), something for starcraft 2 players, etc.<br />
Or say, 12 wins in arena gets you a mount in wow, or a xp boost in hots. Some of you may not like this going between games, but I find it interesting.</div></div><hr />

By having the carrot be in another game entirely, as a reward for playing WoW...<br />
<br />
When WoW used to be the big name, crowd drawing, primo property of Blizzard.<br />
<br />
I know Hearthstone is heavily influenced by WoW, and is Warcraft, and level 20 isn't hard, and Hearthstone is wildly successful, but that still strikes me as sort of pathetic.<br />

Tbh you can reach level 20 in a WoW starter account so you dont even have to purchase World of Warcraft to achieve level 20</div></div><hr />

Ideally, the card text on those cards could change based on the hero you're using (or opposing). That's one of the advantages of a digital card game vs. a physical one.</div></div><hr />

You don't need a sub to hit level 20 anyway so even if it runs out you can do it again. Game has been f2p to 20 since like MoP.</div></div><hr />

Ah yeah your right. forgot about that. Its the first time I unsub since 2009. and already got all classes at max level since mid mop so its been a long time since I did low level leveling anyway ^^ but I heard that from a friend so couldve remembered</div></div><hr />

<br />
No fancy animations, 3D models or whatever, just cards which require lesser work compared to 3D models, world building etc. etc.<br />
<br />
Sell 40 packs for 49.99. If a player isn't good enough to grind a decent deck in 1-2months of playing, they buy packs, and judging from the stories from google, people have spent thousands on those packs.<br />
<br />
If I stop playing Rise of the Tomb Raider, i'm $40+ out of pocket. If I were one those dudes spending hundreds or thousands on packs and stop playing Hearthstone, I just spent thousands on digital cards.<br />
<br />
Cards that I can't trade or sell. Like... if someone stops Magic The Gathering, at least they can sell their collection for some money back.<br />

Did it Hearthstone feel desperate for players when they added the Hearthsteed in WoW as a promotion for playing Hearthstone?<br />
Same for HotS &lt;- WoW with the wolf mount.<br />
Same for HotS, WoW, Hearthstone &amp; Diablo &lt;- Starcraft with special edition including additional stuff on all those games.<br />
Same for Legion special edition giving stuff on all other Blizz games.<br />
Same for a few others I imagine.<br />
<br />
You call it desperate, I call it marketing - And they're pretty good at that =P<br />
<br />
Even if it was exclusive to WoW, nothing unusual about trying whatever you can to bring new players to a 10+ year old game with a big upfront and possibly long-term investment. Especially one such as WoW that has a lot of stigma and prejudice going around. Especially with it being a promotion across 2 games set in the same universe/franchise, and with the promotion going both ways =P (Hearthsteed in for WoW; Liadrin for Hearthstone)<br />
<br />
But hey if you people get a kick out of the thought of a company being desperate / a game dying, good for you all I suppose =P Who am I to judge.</div></div><hr />

i think its a great idea, that if you want something in one game you have to do something in another game, its not something you HAVE to do and its not something that gives you any advantages in either game. So Blizz bring on some more stuff for us to do cross games</div></div><hr />

Just a trite term overused by simpleminded yes-men. Awarding this achievement retroactively would show appreciation for their current customers who have remained despite the lack of content and questionable development choices (now and ongoing). Highlighting that Blizzard is more interested in a revolving door for a community isn't &quot;entitlement&quot;. Grow up.<br />
<br />
The entire purpose of this promotion is to get Hearthstone players who have never played WoW to get into the game with the hope that some percentage of them enjoys it enough to pay for a subscription. If you want them to give this achievement retroactively to &quot;show appreciation for their current customers&quot;, then it would require a sub by your logic - and thus defeat the entire purpose of this promotion. Unless you're asking that they make it retroactive for people with inactive accounts, which contradicts your &quot;current customers&quot; bit and screams of wanting something for nothing.<br />
<br />
I think it's cool that Blizzard is allowing current WoW players to get this promotion. Any established WoW player has at least one set of heirlooms available and will be able to hit level 20 on a fresh character in a fraction of the time that a new player on a starter account will. Most companies in the real world run promotions to try to get people to switch over to their service, and these promotions are almost never available to current customers.<br />
<br />
I don't feel that it's entitlement, but you sure do have some unrealistic expectations. Stuff like this will make more sense when you finish high school and get out into the real world.</div></div><hr />

Playing 3 games in hearthstone for the mount i understand (which is an old promotion). Target existing players for other games the developer offers.<br />
<br />
But given that WoW is not new, and that the majority of players already exist, I see this as entirely less effective in reverse getting HS players to play WoW. This leads me to believe there is another reason for it... just not sure what it could be.</div></div><hr />

Worked fine for me. Hopped on a level 16 alt, equipped Heirlooms and chugged an Elixir of Rapid Mind, ran Wailing Caverns, hit level 20 on like the second boss and got the achievement, was level 24 by the time the dungeon was done.<br />

Liadrin is pretty neat. Not a huge fan of her card artwork, and she doesn't have a unique card back like the other alternate heroes, but her unique animations look really good and I like her art more than Uther's, so that's cool.</div></div><hr />

Yes, there will actually be a Blizzard dev at every theater asking for you to login to battle.net to confirm you are currently subscribed to WoW, otherwise you can't go in; not even if you have previously bought and subscribed to WoW!<br />

I know that's what I've been doing.

Its hard to believe you mean that... last 10 years? did you know cataclysm revamped the entire leveling experience, so every starter zone has been revamped and are way different than they were 6+ years ago. So unless you really leveled 5 times per year, you cannot know if its appealing or not... i highly doubt you leveled every race anyway after cata.</div></div><hr />

Why do you think I said &quot;a bit&quot;? I also said &quot;good on them&quot;. The reason why it looks &quot;a bit&quot; desperate is that their subs have been dropping. Add to that the fact that they have always leveraged WOW to get people into other games, not the other way around. I suppose the Diablo 3 bundled with the yearly pass was another case but those sort of things are few and far in between. WOW was the flagship, the go to game. I get no joy from WOW struggling. I want to play it but they keep f..king things up. Unfortunately, a lot of people here look at the game only from their own perspective. They ignore the silent majority. This sort of act is a bit desperate in that it tries to get people into the game but the flaws are still there so instead of growing the game, it just gives a temporary bump in the numbers. If anything, they needed this to be closer to the Legion launch where they have a chance at fixing things up.</div></div><hr />

Make sure you level from nineteen to twenty outside of a dungeon. <br />

Oh, don't do that to yourself! I dropped heirlooms and dungeons for my Shaman and leveled purely by questing for a change.

<br />
Evidently, contextual comprehension is too much for you. I wasn't aware that alienating your current subscribers is a sound approach to business. Not expecting players who have continued to subscribe (via an actual subscription or Token) to join the now-inundated low-levels would show some appreciation -- is that really so difficult to grasp?<br />

I think it's cool that Blizzard is allowing current WoW players to get this promotion. Any established WoW player has at least one set of heirlooms available and will be able to hit level 20 on a fresh character in a fraction of the time that a new player on a starter account will.<br />
<br />
Assuming these current players aren't on a high-population realm where questing becomes Division-esque. After leveling a every single class on both factions, having to create yet another character on another realm is just annoying.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most companies in the real world run promotions to try to get people to switch over to their service, and these promotions are almost never available to current customers.<br />

This is aimed at Hearthstone players to try wow out (you even get a free trial to get to level 20 too so you don't have to pay a dime). <br />
I love how these people feel like they NEED NEED NEED to get the perk that comes with this. If you don't wanna work for it, don't work for it. NOBODY IS FORCING YOU TO DO THIS. You don't need this perk to play the game you know. <br />
<br />
Buncha whiny complainers...</div></div><hr />

Hmm. Level 20, that's about 6 hours with heirlooms right? Not bad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wyviner</div><div class="date">2016-03-16, 09:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">40+ million people play hearthstone (last I heard), and you can count on almost every single serious one of them with the availability to play WoW to make a lvl 20 character for this promo. Even if only 10 million of the hearthstone players are serious, if 5 million have access to a computer that can run WoW and only 1% of those people land up playing WoW indefinitely, that's 50k more subscribers than they had before the promo. And that's just 1% of half of the serious players that might make only a quarter of the overall Hearthstone population. (0.01 x 0.5 x 0.25) x total hearthstone players, what if it was way more?<br />
<br />
Fun fact: For me personally, when the first promo came out to get the Hearthsteed by winning 3 games in Hearthstone, I had not one care in the world about playing Hearthstone, never planned on ever even trying it. By the time I got my Hearthsteed, I didn't give two shits about WoW anymore. I played Hearthstone for months, and as of writing this reply, years later, I have bought every expansion that has been released, and probably spent $300 or more on card decks, because I can afford to do so. All because of a frick'n mount that I don't even ride, but needed to have. <br />
<br />
This kind of cross promotion makes Blizzard millions and millions of dollars. It works. It's a genius way of getting more subscribers.</div></div><hr />

To allow people who don't play wow to get it withtout back breaking effort.<br />
<br />
And also to piss off entitled idiots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they didn't play WoW, and didn't have characters already, what would having this be retroactive change for them? Oh yea... nothing at all. Got it. Would really love to understand what you mean by &quot;back breaking effort&quot; lol.</div></div><hr />
