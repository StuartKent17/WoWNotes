Yogg-Saron +0 US First Kill by Premonition<br />
The last first kill of Ulduar is now claimed, Premonition (http://www.premoguild.com/) (US - Sen'jin) just defeated Yogg-Saron with no guardian helping for the first time in the US. This is the 3rd world kill on Guildox (http://www.guildox.com/go/g.asp?a=3164). Congratulations to them.<br />

<br />
From Premonition (Premonition Website (http://www.premoguild.com))<br />
This kill was a long time coming. We were working on it for weeks (months?) and theorycraft began ages ago. All of the silly forum threads and &quot;math&quot; that proved it impossible were quite obviously not even close to accurate.<br />
<br />
The progression phases a raid goes through on this fight while learning are just amazing. From how to keep ahead in phase 2, maximizing stun times, getting all corruptors down, then dealing with mob handling in phase 3... with your tanks having extremely limited time, sanity, and tons of pressure to even figure out what they have to do to maximize efficiency, while your DPS is trying to not lose their own sanity while the boss is killed.<br />
<br />
The strategies we went through and brainstormed were pretty damn bizarre at times (rogues sprint kiting, priest fade kiting, warlock demonic teleport kiting), all seemed insane. We settled for a split strategy which required insane AOE dps to pull off successfully, and that's where the summertime + holidays showed up!<br />
<br />
It was an absolute blast, Blizzard truly designed something marvelous here, and we were very excited to know it wasn't going to be nerfed after all (reducing the number of beacons that go out would really ruin the complexity and ways to handle phase 3).<br />
<br />
Great job by everyone in guild, and our members who couldn't be there, and especially our trials who stuck it out. Much respect to STARS and Paragon.<br />
<br />
Video will be coming, frostmage/tank PoV.<br />

If you'll notice, he mouses over and the door is almost dead and they stop and wait. They kite all the mobs into range, and kill them for rank ups. <br />

Believe me, it lags pretty much every WG during peak hours. Usually not until everyone is in the same area, though, which is not the case here (only a ~raid is).<br />

<br />
<br />
Or, maybe, they jumped down before it started? Probably calling the second the door was destroyed 'capped'.</div></div><hr />

It was an absolute blast, Blizzard truly designed something marvelous here<br />
<br />
So would you say its better then Sunwell the pinnacle of BC Raiding in form of strategie and dps required ? And if Yogg +0 is so hard will Blizzard be able to top this encounter with Arthas ? It seems hard for me honestly ;D</div></div><hr />

Nope. We had usually 3-4 hunters ready to taunt. Other than that, we had me (DK), another DK and a paladin ready with taunts as well if something unexpected were to happen. Seemed like the most obvious thing to do, we didn't really formulate all sorts of crazy plans and theorycraft it too much. Started working on it Monday or Tuesday, simply by trying a few things and made some adjustments and tweaks along the way.<br />
<br />
We did have a ton of 1-2% wipes though. I completely have to agree with what Premo says - The fight is incredibly well tuned. It's by a mile the tightest DPS race there is.<br />
<br />
Whatever claims there are of it being an RNG encounter are just silly. You can work around every single thing.</div></div><hr />

Apparently doing this buffed the raid-wide AoE dps more than a differently spec'd mage.<br />
<br />
On a different note, I think the queue system for WG next patch will &quot;fix&quot; this strategy by teleporting people out who aren't selected. Though I don't know what happens to those already in the zone who are chosen.<br />

Yup, its red alert, i love C&amp;C games.<br />

secondly, 62 seconds nothing. it was 100 seconds<br />
<br />
they jumped down at 20 seconds into the movie(and the battle started at about 15)<br />
they touched the orb at 1:58. 2 seconds off of 200 seconds. or they started the assault at 28 seconds. but still.<br />
<br />
was still a very smart idea! I'm on the stormstrike battle group.(Black dragonflight)(Mal'ganis is on this one too)<br />

US stands for United States, and last I was aware, Canada is not apart of the US. Other wise it'd be referenced as NA(North America) or Americans, btw - not sure where this started, or even if it's not a huge deal anymore, but why is it that the general reference to 'Americans' is more commonly used to describe/generalize US citizens rather then South American Countries and Canada? It's as though the sources using said line are ignorantly stating Americans only = US. What's even more baffling is the lack of a difference over all in the countries as far as personalities go. Culture, general awareness/knowledge is the key difference...governments...tend to be such a small number in control and shouldn't ever be used as a way to categorize the whole country, least imo.</div></div><hr />

That WG fight is insane. I remember a bunch of us on Sargeras had an idea like this when WG first came out.

Really? And I thought US was more along the lines of US and them... Browsing through realm lists I don't see the Canadian region, but with all my Canadian guildies I'm willing to bet they aren't playing on an EU server /smug. Back on point… <br />

This whole Continent vs Country argument is crap, it’s multiple countries on either end, and I’m sure that holds true in many of the top guilds on either side of the Atlantic! <br />

Butt hurt? He said gratz and then pointed out that Ensidia hasn't got this kill while three other guilds have. <br />
<br />
Whats with you wanting to start up a flame war between the EU and US? Are you butt hurt your famed EU guild really isn't that great after all?<br />
<br />
That said. Gratz Prem. Gratz Para (Didn't catch yall's kill).<br />
<br />
Also, I laugh at any of you Euro's that continue the EU vs US crap. Continent vs country. You people need to have a tad more patriotism, be proud of your country. Some of your countries are amazing. (Germany! France! Italy! I am looking at you! Can't wait to vacation in Italy and Germany again!)<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Euro's&quot; are proud of their countries in a different sense I don't think you are able to comprehend. Apparently national pride = dumbass-patriotism. Which really only makes you look like an ass-clown. Anyway, America has lots of great things but shitheads like you inhabit it in the north and south, and even Canada...same goes for Europe too though. Basically, to dumb this down for you a bit more, People hating people, sounds about right to me!</div></div><hr />

I guess it is hard for some of you Euros to understand (same for some US players, there are idiots everywhere).<br />
<br />
The US is a country.<br />
<br />
Europe is a continent.<br />
<br />
Hence:<br />

US vs EU = Country vs Continent.<br />

Really? So the Euros on here that always holler &quot;EU &gt; US&quot; are proud of their countries? As in they are hollering EU &gt; US because a EU guild, which may or may not, have anyone representing their country is them showing their patriotism?<br />

<br />
Really? I cannot comprehend being proud of ones country? Really?<br />
<br />
Please. Leave these boards with your ignorant self. You know zilch about me. You are only upset that I flamed a bunch of EU idiots that are likely highly immature. Are you one of them? Seems highly likely by your response.<br />
<br />
Basically your response makes you look like the ass clown; not me. Next time you feel the need to flame an US poster, do so with a tad more intelligence (and humor please.)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
(a)Really? And I thought US was more along the lines of US and them... Browsing through realm lists I don't see the Canadian region, but with all my Canadian guildies I'm willing to bet they aren't playing on an EU server /smug. Back on point… <br />
<br />
(b)This whole Continent vs Country argument is crap, it’s multiple countries on either end, and I’m sure that holds true in many of the top guilds on either side of the Atlantic! <br />
<br />
(c)Close, if you wanted to take me to school, you probably should have included Mexico in North America, but I'm pretty sure they have another server group for them...<br />
<br />
(a)You can /smug all you want. It has already been pointed out and admitted that some Euros play on US servers and vice versa. The annoying debate is simply US vs EU and for the most part the EU flamers target US players specifically, not American players (IE Canada and other American nations).<br />
<br />
(b)You can call it crap all you want but that is because you refuse to admit that most of the EU flamers are targeting the US (not other American nations) because flaming the US is the cool thing to do for immature EU posters.<br />
<br />
(c)No not really. He was spot on. Canada is not part of the US, neither is Mexico. So what is your point? You think there is another server group for Mexican players? That has relevance how?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patriotism is a bad idea. All countries are ALSO filled with idiots.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No, it really isn't a bad idea. If it was, many many countries wouldn't exist today. Including many of the EU nations along with a few western nations.<br />

I noticed a few people like the person above keep pointing out that the video takes longer than 62 seconds for them to kill the door. This is half-true, at least in the video. In the video, the Wintergrasp battle starts at about 0:12 and they cap it at 1:57. That equals a 1 min 45 sec time it takes for them to cap it in the video. However, if you look carefully you can see that everything (including the in-game sounds) are playing slower than 100% video speed.<br />
<br />
To get 62 seconds to equal ~1 min 45 seconds, the video speed would have to be about 4/7 as fast as normal, which would equal out about right. Look at the people's movement and spells casted in the video. They're all going about half as fast as normal. So therefore, ~62 seconds is how long it took them to capture WG if the video speed is ~4/7 and the video took 1 min 45 sec to cap.<br />
<br />
edit: I'd also just like to say that math is your friend. My numbers are rough estimations and it is not exactly equal to 4/7, but rather very close to it. Either way, you can visually see that the video is stretched out and my numbers simply support that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They do things their way, so who is to say that what they do is wrong when it's part of their culture? I've never been outside of the US, so I can't comment on how other countries TRULY view Americans, save for the small voices here and there... but that doesn't represent the entire area. The same goes for me commenting on Europeans or another culture of people.<br />
<br />
People really just need to stop this &quot;we're better than you because a guild from our country/continent did something first&quot; mentality. To the guilds that accomplish these feats, I say grats (yes grats... for I am a gamer and this is a forum, not a school). To all the people saying their country/continent is better, you had better get with reality... because if you aren't a part of the guild that accomplished stuff like Yogg +0, your words carry no weight because you had nothing to do with the success of another guild for your country/continent.<br />
<br />
And I say that to everyone. I don't care if you're American, European, Asian, or whatever... it's a game. Petty competitions like this never end well. They just make all of us look like idiots.</div></div><hr />

Respect for yet another US poster falls by -1 simply because once again all you can do is bash another guild to &quot;prove your superiority&quot;<br />
<br />
I dont know what it is with you US, but you just prove time and time again that unless your first you cant congratulate anyone else that beats you.<br />
<br />
We all get taught sterotyping is wrong, but many times it proves to be truth.<br />
<br />
When you finally get some World firsts i hope you get the same treatment that you dish out to other guilds. Because not many people are going to say you deserved it, just through your pig arrogant attitude.<br />
<br />
What Ensidia has done for the community and this game can be rivalled by no one. I personally think its great that they have some decent competition for a change, its healthy.<br />
<br />
I just hope you can give the guilds who get World firsts some respect, and not just if its a US guild. Double standards is uber fail.</div></div><hr />

Do a search on my previous posts and then accuse me of not giving credit where credit is due. BTW, Paragon copied Stars tactics. Premonition used their own. Still grats to both. As far as stereotyping goes....stuck up Euro who thinks &quot;he's&quot; smarter than anyone. See, I can do it as well.<br />

<br />
Second, the UI of the person filming makes me cry, so clustered and blah. Nevertheless it got the job done and that, in the end, is all that matters.<br />
<br />
Third, excellent music selection for the video.<br />
<br />
Well done. ;D</div></div><hr />

Paragon had their own p3 tactic and its nothing like stars rng pile of mobs tactic, if you would get your facts straight before posting about an encounter you obviously have no clue what so ever.</div></div><hr />

You acknowledge that stereotyping is wrong, yet you label everyone in the United States as a bunch of losers who can't congratulate people if they are not from the United States as well? I'm seeing something wrong with your logic. I live in the United States, yes, but I give congratulations to The Firsts, regardless of nationality. On the rare occasion the US gets up there with the first people to down an encounter, you bet I'll be happy about it.<br />
It's something called pride. Everyone has it. Too much of it is a problem, of course, and tends to make one look like an asshole. We have pride for our guilds, no different than you have pride for yours.<br />
