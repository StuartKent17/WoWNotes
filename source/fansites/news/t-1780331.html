<br />
Only other CE mount was the imperial quilen. There wasn't one in Cata, there wasn't one in WotLK, there wasn't one in TBC, there wasn't one in vanilla. There were pets, though. If the imperial quilen is any indication, the dread raven will get removed before long. Digital CE items haven't really had any epeen value since the digital deluxe version became a thing (which was in MoP). If Cata had a digital deluxe, you can bet I would have gotten it for the pet. I didn't and I wasn't spending a small fortune to buy the physical CE. Anyone can get the digital deluxe since those don't run out theoretically while physical collector's editions do.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wasn't thrilled that the dread raven got devalued by the corrupted dread raven, but I would have preferred they put in a recolored Imperial Quilen to devalue both. Guess we'll see if Blizzard sneaks the corrupted dread raven back in somewhere else or keeps it removed. Rather funny that people complained about the apexis wolf price and now that one is the raid achievement mount.</div></div><hr />

Meh. Get rid of the versatility stat entirely, then I'll care more.<br />
<br />
<br />
High-Profile Known Issues (some of which are already fixed in current dev builds):<br />
Shadow Priest 2-Piece Bonus removes the cooldown of Mindbender rather than reduce it.<br />
Sounds like fun. Alas, alas.<br />
<br />
<br />
Item - Shaman T16 Enhancement 4P Bonus When Flame Shock deals periodic damage, you have a 5% chance to gain 5 stacks of Searing Flames and reset the cooldown of Lava Lash.<br />
Looks like Blizzard is finally correcting the tooltip issue I pointed out awhile back on the forums. =)<br />
<br />
<br />
Item - Shaman T18 Enhancement 2P Bonus Stormstrike now generates 2 charges of Maelstrom Weapon and you may now have a maximum of 10 Maelstrom charges. Whenever you gain a Maelstrom Weapon charge, you Electrocute all nearby enemies within 10 yards for [ 15% of Spell Power ] Nature damage.<br />
While a better 2pc bonus, I have to admit that being able to bank MW charges would have been a decent QoL. Maybe they'll make the first iteration baseline for enhance shaman someday.</div></div><hr />

The gear was garbage anyway and was not worth the amounts they were asking for to begin with. As far as Apexis Crystals go, it does not matter if they have a cap or not. Its not like there is really a lot to buy with the in the first place. At least will be able to collect a 150k of them to go along with a 100k gold to bu another worthless mount that has nothing and does nothing special for it cost, other then its a Fel Direwolf pulled out of SMV.<br />

Just so people don't think this is a joke, this is actually true as of this build.<br />

And frankly it is more appropriate considering that means it now costs an arm and a leg.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that is the issue and well I could never be bothered with the Apexis gear myself as grew bored of the daily very fast, that and grew tired of the Garrison invasions that inevitably came from doing the daily and dungeons and so on..<br />

cool - you can spend 20k for 675 piece or got to mythic dungeon and get 685 for free , or got to AH and buy hc hc citadel boes for similiar amount of gold while buying 6.1 boes for like 3-4k cuase it will drop extremly - this is some kind of retarded lame joke from blizz.<br />

Yes... until they apply 'raid passes' to raids that you have to buy with real money or grind 10000000000g 1000000000 apexis to go in... like the raid tiers in Heartstone. The truth is that everyone says 'this doesn't affect me at all' until it does and then they bitch about it and then they go. You think 'raid passes' are not possible or that it is too far out? Now that they have gold monetized every aspect of wow is fair game to be worth us$... they can just answer 'well if you don't have the time to grind that much gold you can always buy tokens'...<br />
<br />
Mounts rewards ingame look like shit... everything that doesn't looks like shit now costs money or a shit-ton of gold, not a coincidence. Of course people are gonna defend blizzard 'that won't happen'... but Blizzard is just cleaning house, they want the big whales paying and everyone else out. If they had 10 players and had the same income they would be happy, they don't care about players numbers... only of players money that's the big problem and that is why they can say 'yeah we dropped 3M but np here is another mount to compensate'.</div></div><hr />
