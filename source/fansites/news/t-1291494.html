Upcoming Pet Battle Changes<br />
Here's what we're thinking and working on at the moment, and again, please share your thoughts and feedback:<br />
<br />
Aquatic: Harmful DoTs reduced by 50% (up from 25%)<br />
<br />
Aquatic-types currently reduce the effect of harmful damage over time abilities by 25%. Because few creatures have more than one DOT, this ends up being a less than steller damage reduction over the course of the battle. We feel increasing the effect to 50% should help aquatic pets benefit more from their passive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Critters: Immune to CC completely<br />
<br />
Critters currently reduce the duration of crowd control effects by one round, which makes fast critters significantly more powerful. We'd like critters of all speeds to benefit equally from their passive, so we're considering making them immune to crowd control effects completely. This would include stuns, roots, and other incapacitating effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
Magic: Cannot be dealt more than 35% of total health in one move (down from 40%)<br />
<br />
Magic-type creatures currently cannot take more than 40% of their maximum health as damage when struck. When balance changes were made to reduce the damage of some very heavy-hitting abilities, this passive was indirectly nerfed. We're thinking if we buff the effect to 35% of maximum health, that should compensate for previous adjustments.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, everything is subject to further adjustments, but our ultimate goal is to bring all passives up to the power level of some of the current favorites, such as Undead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Uniqueness<br />
Didn't people complain about class favoritism whenever a class got something special? And now people complain about this. Figures. <br />
We still strive to make the classes as unique as possible while offering a balance that doesn't lead to anyone feeling useless in raids (which was a very real concern a few years ago), and to a greater or lesser extent, I think we accomplish that goal. When I play a Warrior, Death Knight, Rogue, or Monk, for example, there are certainly similarities--they are all melee classes, after all. Crucially, there are also significant differences that span the entire experience of playing each class, and which contribute to a distinctly different feel for each one. Even among &quot;pure&quot; classes, each spec can feel quite distinct from the others, and that's certainly the case amongst hybrids.<br />
<br />
So, for fear of using an often tossed buzzword, &quot;homogenization&quot; is a matter of degrees. I personally don't feel that we've at all crossed a threshold where playing one class feels essentially like playing another. I find myself reading posts where players are talking about the buffs a class brings to a raid, or listing off the abilities a class has like a litany. These lists are, themselves, devoid of context though. More classes bring more buffs because that was a problem we needed to solve. Classes have similar abilities to encourage flexibility in group composition. If these are the only measures by which you judge how similar classes are, then I think that you're missing the trees for the forest. Nuance matters. &quot;Feel&quot; matters. How a class toolset interacts with itself matters. <br />
<br />
I would make the case that, for the purposes of game play, how a given spec or class plays is really what makes it distinct from the others, even if different classes can sometimes share similar roles. After all, that's nothing new to World of Warcraft; we've always had healers, dps, and tanks. Players have greater flexibility than ever to choose a class that they enjoy playing for the raw experience of playing it, rather than for what buff it provides.<br />
<br />
I don't mind so much the same effects on different classes to even out raid need but I do wish that the classes were different enough that just by eying a piece of gear you could tell what class it was meant for even if it wasn't a set. A good example was back in BC when you could tell the difference between Lock oriented gear and Mage oriented gear by the amount of Stamina on it.<br />
This is intentional. There was a lot of &quot;wasted&quot; gear back in the day.<br />
<br />
It was very common to go into a raid without a full assortment of classes (which was also common, because some of the classes simply didn't have enough to offer in a raid), and get gear that wasn't good for anyone in attendance. It didn't prove to be a good item design then, and I suspect that it wouldn't work much better now. We've done a lot to solve problems like this over time.<br />
<br />
Introducing actual choices in gearing is extremely difficult, because when it comes to player power, all it takes is a spreadsheet showing that item A is better than item B, and suddenly item B is &quot;trash&quot;. It becomes a let down to get it, even though ostensibly it's supposed to be an upgrade. <br />
<br />
Is that why rogues all feel the same? <br />
Rogues are something of an edge case, and moving previously spec defining abilities into the talent tree probably contributes to this, though I'd argue that it's resulted in a class that's more fun to play overall. Still, I find that Combat feels different from Assassination feels different from Sub. The differences are admittedly more subtle (no pun intended) than some other classes, though. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
PvE<br />
Doing amazing dps on raids, then walk out and everything feels slow and clunky cause I don't have a 5% crit buff<br />
Our goal is that you feel more awesome when you're with your friends. That is the whole intent behind raid buffs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324582494550769664))<br />
<br />
Tier skipping is necessary, old content is OLD and should be treated as old. Blizz needs to stop catering for elitists<br />
It's fun to kill the final boss in a raid. We don't want players to kill boss 1 and 2 and then go on to the next raid. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324582205458354176))<br />
<br />
I propose world bosses should only drop loot you don't have, especially if it's Unique-Equipped loot, so much frustration.<br />
Would you rather have no loot or repeat loot? Because we're not just going to give you good loot every kill. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324580097711538176))<br />
why not?<br />
Because you'd be done with the raid in two weeks and then ask politely how long until the next raid is ready. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324708577853988865))<br />
<br />
Why is there no time for 5-mans but plenty for Heroic raids? More do dungeons than heroic. Why not develop to larger group?<br />
Many players care about heroic raiding even if they don't run it. Blood Legion's Lei Shen video has like 60K views. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324579762527944704))<br />
And to be fair, most of the work goes into the raid in general which also supports LFR and normal, not into heroic content. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324579898750541825))<br />
<br />
Screw that! I don't want a healer queing in scenario, 45min LFR Q, I don't have time to waste about 5-10 mins.<br />
It's a heroic scenario. You won't be able to queue. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323947185991462912))<br />
No queueing, will there be an ilvl req for these? Please say no, would rather they be skill-based.<br />
There is an ilevel requirement but it's more to keep people from stumbling into content that they can't handle. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324328770834153474))<br />
If you're interested in heroic scenarios, chances are you'll meet the requirements to do them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324328880733294592))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
We are trying role checks for BGs in 5.3 to make sure there are enough healers on both sides. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321769025321447424))<br />
<br />
50% Battle Fatigue ouch. That'll hurt things like Recup/Second Wind severely. Any thoughts on letting them ignore it?<br />
We don't think the %heals need the nerf. Might let all classes (e.g. rogue, warrior) benefit from PvP Power healing to offset it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319904285729116160))<br />
<br />
Disabling auto follow in Battle Grounds has only hurt the multi boxer.<br />
The problem is when multi boxers are having fun in PvP, everyone else often is not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322396622594125824))<br />
<br />
Any thoughts of making fear break from damage? It's just a thought. I usually take at least 20-25% of my health before it does<br />
It used to, but if a lock had someone dotted, the Fear would just immediately break. It could be the threshold is too generous. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322395414500352000))<br />
<br />
If an equally skilled &amp; geared DPS and Healer 1v1'd, in your opinion should the healer be able to forever out heal the damage?<br />
If they can't then how would the healer ever keep up a 3 player team? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321316046151753729))<br />
That said, it's more complicated than that. Healers can run OOM. DPS can interrupt or CC or get kill windows. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321316173247549441))<br />
<br />
I think when exp 5 class/systems design team begin their work you might consider one CC DR and nerf pvp healing.<br />
Agree on taking another look at DRs. PvP healing doesn't feel bad to us at the moment though (except maybe too many instants). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323147926278905857))<br />
<br />
Just so we're clear: PvP balance (buffs/nerfs) happen around the Top PvP spec of a class, instead of &quot;All 34 specs&quot;?<br />
There are two schools of thought: make PvP fun with fewer specs vs. get all 34 in there and embrace chaos. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323948760784834560))<br />
We don't have an official stance yet and try to keep in touch with how the community feels. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323948931602079744))<br />
<br />
is the new debuff when holding flags as prot in rbg meant to disscourage tank roles in rbg or to encourage pvp power for them?<br />
We want tanks as flag carriers to feel useful but not mandatory. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323945751266877440))<br />
<br />
You guys don't think there is too much CC in PVP? reality check please.<br />
I'd argue nearly all of the depth from PvP comes from CC. Without it, you're just blowing people up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325334896405004288))<br />
The CC that offends us the most are stuns, since they stop you and let someone do lots of damage. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325334973257224192))<br />
Debating having more stuns that break on damage (even if it's faily high damage). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325335034687016961))<br />
<br />
65% base resi takes away from the feeling of progression for PvPers. Power isn't enough to keep that feeling. Your thoughts?<br />
That was our philosophy for years, but we've come around. Increasing damage / healing with gear feels better. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324701708456435712))<br />
When you can't even survive PvP with very low resilience, it's hard to be motivated to continue. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324701990200426496))<br />

<br />
It is fun. The first few times.<br />
<br />
But months later when everyone has moved on to 522+ content, no one wants to run entry level tier anymore, and my alts are left in the dust. Who is that disappointed if they allow us to catch up alts with some dungeon epics when any dedicated raider is already loaded with better items? The MGT, ToC/ICC, and ZG/Hour of Twilight dungeons of past expansions were excellent implementations of catch up mechanics that allowed players to obtain reasonably relevant gear, while still keeping the best rewards locked away to dedicated raiders.<br />
<br />
I think they've lost sight of the difference between extending gameplay, and enhancing replay value.<br />

<br />
Different players enjoy different aspects of the game. I never got tired of running Hour of Twilight dungeons over and over for gear, nor the heroics of prior expansions either. The time commitment was short, the coordination fairly minimal, and the rewards quite substantial (though below that of raids). There is also a greater connection to the story in end-game 5 mans, and often some really great displays of game mechanics that outshine those of heroics that shipped with the expansion's release. 5 mans also have the advantage of being balanced around the same group makeup every time, 1 tank, 1 healer, 3 dps - there's no need for artificially induced tank swaps or specific class abilities, every class of every role can come in and enjoy the content.</div></div><hr />

And 60K hits of a world first kill is impressive? With a sub base of almost 10 million? That is rather piss. At the same time, I think both sides of the argument are wrong. Heroic raids or dungeons? People complain about having to do dungeons and how pointless they are after the first couple weeks of dinging. And Heroic Raids, not many even do them (or plan to do them). They try to add other filler like the scenarios and people complain about that. I think blizz is in a no win situation while being in a total win situation.</div></div><hr />

60k isn't really a lot in a 10 million players game, especially with all the featuring of the videos on sites like this. Even i clicked the video because i wanted to know what the boss looks like, i couldn't be less interested in the heroic raiding scene. So it's a bad example.<br />
And i guess thats what the poster meant by saying that much more people would be interested in 5er dungeons.</div></div><hr />

I never got tired of running Hour of Twilight dungeons over and over for gear, nor the heroics of prior expansions either. The time commitment was short, the coordination fairly minimal, and the rewards quite substantial (though below that of raids). There is also a greater connection to the story in end-game 5 mans, and often some really great displays of game mechanics that outshine those of heroics that shipped with the expansion's release. 5 mans also have the advantage of being balanced around the same group makeup every time, 1 tank, 1 healer, 3 dps - there's no need for artificially induced tank swaps or specific class abilities, every class of every role can come in and enjoy the content.<br />
<br />
Sure i don't say that there is nobody who enjoys them, but as i take from your argument, its mainly for gearing up fast for the current tier and thats what LFR is now for IMO.<br />
Lore-wise i can also understand your point, but i think with scenarios they gave us an alternative, and maybe HC-Scenarios will &quot;fill the gap&quot; for people who don't enjoy LFR but want the gear.<br />
<br />
I must admit that im biased since i rather want raid-content over anything else but i seriously believe seeing the community during times like TotC/FL/DS that having not enough raid-content hurts the game more than having no 5m dungeons each patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I usually side with GCs assessments of a lot of player complaints, but this, I simply cannot see how he makes this assessment. There is no depth when I cannot play my character because as soon as I show up I am hit with a constant chain of CC and then I die. As a healer, everyone's Healer's Must Die addon goes off and I'm locked out of playing. <br />
<br />
There is no fun or depth in that at all. Maybe CC in Arena has depth, that I could understand, and PvP without addons has some better play with CC, but in the live game, battleground PvP as a healer is nothing but miserable because of all the CC. I used to enjoy BGs but now, there really isn't any point as there's no fun to be had. And I'm at a loss as to how Ghostcrawler doesn't see this happening.</div></div><hr />

LFR + gear up fast = does not compute. Even with the increased drop rate the stuff you need never drops. You have to use all 20 elder charms to even think about getting any actual upgrade a week. Personally I think the drop rate for the current lfr should be increased to what the old lfr is right now.<br />
<br />
Blizzard likes using the excuse that we'd gear up too fast from lfr even though I've gotten 3x more upgrades from valor gear than I've ever gotten from lfr. To me anyone who says RNG is RNG is agreeing that RNG is flawed. Blizzard brought the complaining on themselves by vastly increasing the number of raiders due to lfr which put their always flawed RNG system under a much needed microscope. This alone makes me glad lfr was added, since now we'll get roll protection added finally.</div></div><hr />

Me too! This was the one thing in 5.1 that excited me - I saved up and saved up, was ready with all the mats for 5.2 to drop. I was going to go fight the guy or whatever, learn the new schematics, and spend the next 30 days converting my saved-up bars to the lightning whatevers. This was more excited and happy than I had been in all the rest of MOP. Naturally. All the mats are sitting in my low level monk alt's bank. :(</div></div><hr />

They want to bring in something fast with regards to LFR loot drops, there are quite a few rumblings of dissatisfaction amongst a few people with how the current LFR drop rate is.. For the time and effort some put in to an LFR run to only get gold from your initial roll and bonus roll for some is starting to wear thin case in point one of my guildies has had nothing from 30+ encounters in ToT LFR to the extent they have about had enough, and another guildy spent about 2 to 3 months trying to get one thing from the 5.0 LFRs.. <br />
<br />
It does get annoying when you can do an entire LFR quarter (3 bosses and get nothing), to the point even I will only run one maybe two LFR's because of the amount of hassle you have with groups and if you have a bad group you spend a couple hours in a LFR to wind up at the end with all gold drops, the RNG is flawed big time when this system first came in Cata thought cool this will stop the hassles of the old system. But in the cold light of day this new system is now even just as bad and more so if Blizz are saying this is spose to be the new for those to gear up their toons instead of 5 mans..<br />
<br />
Heck on my toon I have more VP gear than LFR gear with a 2 ToT 10 normal pieces thrown in. But as one of my guildies said tonight if Blizz don't fix it fast they may end up losing a load more players due to how bad the RNG is.<br />

Yeah the RNG on learning new profession recipes is a laugh can go for a week without learning a 522 pattern even though when you do you either A: can't afford the Haunting Spirits or B: you have better through raiding or VP's.. lol</div></div><hr />

It wasnt so bad for tailoring since there are only 4 sets but on my LW I still have over a week of discoveries to make and Ive been doing it every day. Too many different leather specs. But yeah unless you can get haunting spirit it doesnt matter. I wish you could buy them with VP or something or DE from LFR/VP gear. Also there are no VP 522 head or boot pieces so you have to get raid drops or craft them.</div></div><hr />

I think the return on investment for players was just overall immensely higher from new 5 mans. There were still bad players, there was still RNG, but it was mitigated by the fact that players to rerun the content as they pleased.<br />
<br />
On top of that, players had better access to valor and rep vendors, rep grinds weren't a chore, and justice points actually had value.<br />
<br />
They've essentially thrown out all the freedom to gear as we please, and shoehorned everyone into LFR and dailies as the be-all-end-all means of gearing anything, be it main or alt. It used to be that if one couldn't raid, they had X, Y, and Z outlets for gear. Now they essentially tell us that there is one system to support players of all levels of dedication, and those who cannot dedicate time will simply just have to wait longer to get rewarded.</div></div><hr />
