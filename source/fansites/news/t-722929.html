Facebook/Twitter TCG Loot Code Giveaway<br />
WoWTCGLoot.com (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/) was nice enough to throw a couple of TCG loot codes my way to give them away on Twitter and Facebook! <br />
<br />
People who liked the MMO-Champion Page on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/pages/MMO-Champion/132326176778287) will have a chance to win 1 x Paper Flying Machine Kit (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/paper_flying_machine_kit.htm) or 1 x Landro's Gift Box (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/landros_gift.htm)!<br />
Following me on Twitter.com (http://twitter.com/Boubouille_MMO) will give you a chance to win not one, but 2 x Landro's Gift Box (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/landros_gift.htm)!<br />
<br />
How does it work?<br />
It's easy, just become a Fan of MMO-Champion on Facebook (http://www.facebook.com/pages/MMO-Champion/132326176778287) and/or Follow me on Twitter (http://twitter.com/Boubouille_MMO)! Winners will be picked randomly at 08:00PM PST and the code will be sent to the winning Twitter/Facebook account shortly after. <br />
<br />
This is just a small test run to see if I can do that often because this kind of contest seems easier to manage on social networking sites than on the site or the forums. More interesting codes are already in the way depending on how things go. Good luck!<br />
<br />
Thanks to WoWTCGLoot.com (http://www.wowtcgloot.com/) for the shiny loot codes. <br />

Patch 3.3.5 - Vote Kick Change<br />
Blizzard finally found a good use to the tracking stats added with Patch 3.3.3 a few months ago.<br />
Abandoned LFG (hidden) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4793/abandoned-lfg-hidden/)<br />
Completed LFG (hidden) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4791/completed-lfg-hidden/)<br />
Kicked in LFG (follower) (hidden) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4792/kicked-in-lfg-follower-hidden/)<br />
Kicked in LFG (initiator) (hidden) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4794/kicked-in-lfg-initiator-hidden/)<br />
Kicked in LFG (target) (hidden) (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/4795/kicked-in-lfg-target-hidden/)<br />
We have found that most players using the Dungeon Finder don’t use the Vote Kick feature or abandon groups very often. For these players, we are removing the cooldown on voting to kick players from a dungeon party. In contrast, those players who tend to kick players or abandon groups more frequently will notice that the Vote Kick feature maintains its cooldown. The goal here is to make sure players who are generally patient can make use of the Vote Kick feature when they really need it, without giving a more powerful tool to those who try to kick others or abandon dungeon groups very frequently.<br />
<br />
This functionality will adjust itself as a player’s behavior while using the Dungeon Finder changes. <br />

Haste buffs<br />
It's extremely likely that the 3% global haste buff category is being removed completely, and Improved Moonkin Aura will offer the 5% spell haste buff, along with however it is distributed for Shadow Priests, and Shaman,<br />
Yes, we are reclassifying all of the haste buffs as spell haste buffs or melee attack speed buffs. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25134893717/cataclysm-utility-of-a-shadow-priest/))<br />
<br />
Masteries / Passive Tree Bonuses<br />
The passive talent tree bonuses are intended to let you get better at your intended spec just by spending points in the tree. We felt like talents had gotten to a place where they had lost some of their original goal for allowing player customization. So many talent points were considered mandatory just to make your character functional that there were very few actual choices you could make.<br />
<br />
(We call the passive talent tree bonuses &quot;passive talent tree bonuses&quot; to differentiate them from the mastery stat on gear, which affects only the third talent tree bonus. We came to that distinction late and are honestly a little sloppy about the nomenclature to this day, so &quot;mastery&quot; sometimes gets used interchangeably as the talent tree passives themselves and as the stat on gear that affects the third of those passives.)<br />
<br />
In Cataclysm we have an opportunity to get a lot of those passive talents out of the talent trees. At the same time, we do need to allow for a distinction between say the higher damage and lower survivability of a Fury warrior compared to a Protection warrior. If individual talents shoulder too much of that burden, then the talents aren't much of a choice. Instead, we give you passive bonuses just for spending points in the tree. Protection warriors care most about reducing damage and maintaining threat, so those are the first two passive talent bonuses. The third one we wanted to feel specific to the Prot warrior tree, so that one is going to relate to blocking with a shield.<br />
<br />
Another way to think about it is that each talent in the Protection tree also says &quot;and reduces incoming damage by X, increases damage done by Y when tanking, and increases block effectiveness by Z.&quot;<br />
<br />
I wouldn't say that we intended for all of these passives to be super sexy. It's more accurate to say that we use them to allow the talents themselves to be more exciting and ideally game-changing and a little less &quot;kitchen sinky.&quot;<br />
<br />
If I'm 51/20/0, and someone else is 51/0/20, we both get the same talent bonuses from blood, but do I get frost passives while he gets unholy passives?<br />
In your example, both DKs would get the maximum passive bonus possible from Blood and nothing else. You are only ever one tree. The points you spend in another tree will help out because those talents accomplish something, but you don't get bonuses for them. You are either a Blood, Frost or Unholy DK. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25172118512/mastery-design-intent/))<br />
<br />
Mandatory Talents<br />
There will still be mandatory talents. We're not really trying to make a talent like Sword and Board optional. We expect most Prot warriors of appropriate level will grab it. Related, we doubt we'll see an end to cookie-cutter specs. As long as the recommended Prot tree says &quot;You must get Sword and Board&quot; then that's essentially a cookie-cutter.<br />
<br />
We would like to accomplish a couple of goals though.<br />
<br />
1) For more casual players (i.e. the ones not posting in this forum), we want there to be less difference in power between an optimal and sub-optimal spec. It's okay if the optimal one is still better, but not so much better. Casual players should feel fine just spending points with a small amount of consideration and not feeling like step one is to go to the Internet to find the right build. The passive bonuses help with that.<br />
<br />
2) For those players that do take optimization very seriously (and I'm assuming most of you are in that category), we just want to see more cookie-cutter builds that say things like &quot;spend the last 5-10 points wherever you want.&quot; If those points would give you survivability or a massive threat bonus or even utility that's hard to live without (say Warbringer for a Prot warrior), then you're not really spending the points where you want. But we think there is room to have some of those choices that don't really exist now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25172118512/mastery-design-intent/))<br />

Molten Armor in Cataclysm<br />
Molten Armor won't be boosting Spirit. Spirit is really a healer stat in Cataclysm and mages and warlocks shouldn't really look for it on their gear. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25170438754/molten-armor-and-4-0-cata/))<br />

Soulstones / Warlock Utility<br />
We do want to make Soulstones a more reliable battle rez in Cataclysm. We are also looking at the general package of group buffs and debuffs brought by the warlock class as a whole and the respective specs. There will still be an occasional (very occasional) role for a warlock to &quot;tank&quot; as a caster or to use a demon to tank something. With crowd control mattering more in 5-player dungeons, there will also be more opportunities to Banish or Seduce.

Active / Passive Masteries Bonus<br />
It's not really PvP related. We are trying a couple of things. First, we just need to get a feel for what kind of mastery bonuses are the most fun. Very active ones might be fun (because you're doing something) or very passive ones might be fun (because then the bonus is never wasted). Likewise, Arms already has a lot going on in the way of procs to manage, so having yet another thing to pay attention to may be overwhelming. Fury on the other hand falls into a little more predictable rotation so having the Enrages be a bigger deal may not be an undue burden.

<br />
<br />
I would consider myself hardly 'trigger happy' and I likely kicked people once every 5 runs if they were hardcore slacking off. By hardcore I mean DPS in 200 range overall when they were in decent gear, I don't think I ever kicked a healer, maybe once when they sat afk at the zone or if they just refused to heal (which in my battle group is actually a decent amount). <br />
<br />
Overall few people want the hassle of kicking people so thats why numbers are low. If you kicked someone and got a decent replacement every time you kicked a player, more people would be inclined to kick people being bad for whatever sake.<br />
<br />
I still don't like the idea that I essentially must carry bads in my group for a certain duration before I am the one that has to play the bad guy and either call the person out on their skill (or lack thereof) or kick them because no one else wants the hassle.<br />
<br />
Whatever, another win for people getting carried and people who wont kick.</div></div><hr />

In practice, if someone is that kick happy, then they are going to eventually hit a point where their wait is longer than the time of the dungeon (hehe, soft capped).<br />
<br />
Also, as someone who rarely kicks, this sounds like a nice change.<br />

For me trigger happy tanks are the one that rush in pull to much to handle then blame it on the healer and DPS. The ones that try to kick a random person out of the blue without saying a word rather then 'pwnd lmao'. The ones that go bezerk if your grabbing a drink during the loading screen and half a minute after that. The ones that bitch about your DPS while your doing twice+ the dmg of his noob friend. Had alot of decent tanks but for some reason the dickheads seem to be around in equal numbers or more as the nicer ones. Completely agree with you on 200dps slackers and afkers I'm there to get through the instance for xp or badges not to let a leecher get his xp/emblems. Rather point it out first and give him a few tips before kicking someone, makes me/you a lot less the badguy imho. Tbh it isn't a win for slackers at all but for people that value a good fun group and don't use their kicks in a trigger happy way. But I don't have instant tank queue's and have to wait between 1 and 30 minutes for a party. So yes I prefer a good group without all the hassle and bitching.</div></div><hr />

'allow warlocks to do a little tanking'<br />
<br />
hooray lol. I know, somebody will reply 'roll a tank noob' to which I reply simply. BAH<br />
<br />
Nah I have a tank, but it is bloody hilarious tanking things like Sind trash as a warlock. keeps the healers on their toes, shocks the tanks. screws the dps when you sit there tanking 20+ mobs doing an easy 30k bwahaha silly mages just try it!<br />
<br />
I'm really glad tho. I mean that 6% in demon form etc, juuuuust about made it work. I can see how this (with the scaling ratings reqs) might mean that later in the xpac, when gear is high we can do go HCs as a tank pretty much (shame we can q as them, I already am a HC ready tank!) as they wont have the rating needs of later stuff.<br />
<br />
I can see why being able to tank sind trash is a bit OTT. (if you havnt, fucking try it ASAP!)</div></div><hr />

Probably, as well as the before mentioned hint at Anub'arak's legs and wing shell on that side as well; though this could also be Frostmourne's hilt, I'm not sure of it's design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I keep coming across healers and DPS who lag behind whilst on my DK tank, and tanks who (while good tanks) pull stuff so slowly I generally tell one of the melee DPS to just charge in and I'll keep them up.<br />
<br />
No problem in rushing and getting a lot of things at once but it shouldn't be over done and wipe thats what I ment. I love tanks that know how to pull alot but not to many ;). But both the whole party must be able to handle that not just the tank and healer. If the DPS is to low then it will fail anyway. Fast runs keep the instances fun you done over and over and over and over again but people shouldn't go to fast.</div></div><hr />

We had a lock 2 nights ago who went afk for 13 min. at the start of the instance, claiming that he needed something to eat... we tried without success to kick the bugger but it said &quot;cant kick player for another 15 min&quot; and then counting down until he actually came back and did the last boss with us...<br />

Naah ts not your kingslayer title, hell anyone who can clear 10 can get that...its not even your 277's (gunship lawl). People can clear an instance in under 10 min usually, some instances aside like freaking CoS which still takes about 10 min because of the retarded conversations the NPC's have.<br />
<br />
No tank in their right mind will boot a good healer, so either you are lying about your gear or skill OR you are acting like a dick in your groups and basically berating people into doing what you want in a system where all they have to do to get another healer is kick you and wait a couple seconds. It honestly sounds more like the latter but hey, no profile to back up your claim of '277 gear' means it could be either...</div></div><hr />

I wont &quot;twitter&quot; you my armory you'll get over it.<br />
Anyone can fight both sides of it you can complain about someone being a prick or you can be the one telling people to stop wasting time and move on there's no need to stand around chatting get on a social networking site if you want to do that. <br />
Another thing that runs rampant due to playing with people within a battle group is people waiting for everyone to greed and need a blue drop or w/e it might be... Where does that come from? <br />
Ive'd seen a Ton of TANKS that ninja stuff then claim its for alts or &quot;other stats/side spec&quot; which is fine if you ASK not just need after we all greeded or sharded. Don't pass up legit issues with just being a dirtbag.<br />
Again it might be my toon that gets a &quot;elitist&quot; rep the second i bark at someone for trying to go faster or it might be just my great battlegroup hah<br />

I'm not claiming all tanks are morons even do as my healing experience tells me they don't like to be told to hurry up.<br />

<br />
If you overgear something then yes, us mere mortals aren't going to make it that fun for you.<br />
<br />
If you find other people annoying, then form a guild or level an alt, then you will come down to our level and realise there's an awful lot of difference.<br />
<br />
Or you could relax a bit, chill out, and take it as a game, then perhaps it wouldn't bother you.<br />
<br />
There's no need to call someone a prick because you don't agree with them. Your last message was rather selfish behaviour. It's a multiplayer game. I like chatting to people - I don't babble, but I interact with my guild while levelling and with my party when I do randoms. I enjoy it much more than a single player game, which sounds like it would suit you a bit more, then you could speed run to your heart's content.<br />
<br />
Lighten up a bit and I think you'd enjoy things a lot more. Or don't do randoms if you don't trust people in them to live up to your high standards.<br />
<br />
@Svad - this comes with the new patch. The notes last time around were mainly to do with the PTR testing, then they found out they needed more research on the issue and delayed the roll-out until they were sure people wouldn't just abuse the feature. I'm happier they decided to do it dynamically because it means we can all boot leechers and jackasses without the fear that someone who queues for a random dungeon with random players can't just cherry pick who he wants to continue with and then boot the rest *every time*.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard are an American company. WoW is first and foremost an American game made by American designers. They get the patch first, Europe get it later, makes sense.<br />
<br />
Why limit the patch so that 200 or so players have a chance at a &quot;world first kill&quot;. It's not like world firsts actually mean anything to more than a few hundred people. It's no big deal.<br />
<br />
I'm not American but I wouldn't complain if they got it early, they are getting the rest of the patch early, i don't see the fuss. WoW fans QQ too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Originally i thought it would count all trees and add your bonuses together, so if you had 53 points in combat, with a few points in assasination, you would get a very large passive bonus from combat, but still a small bonus from assasination. <br />
<br />
The new way seems to make talent trees even more limited than before. Everytime you go out of your paticular tree you are missing on passive bonuses, so unless the talent itself is epic, it would work out best to go fully in one tree?<br />
<br />
I was kind of hoping for a situation where you are torn between picking a combat talent and a assination talent, as say the combat skill could be slightly more appealing, but you could really do with a little bit of armor pen. Or something like that.<br />
<br />
Im worried we are going to see even less different talent trees than currently, i thought the idea was to broaden the amount of talent trees that are truely viable :(</div></div><hr />

I'm European. I'm in a guild that only has LK25H left and I'm pretty bored. Personally I think if you are getting the patch first, you should have the instance too. Game is boring now. We're not getting it til later. Really don't see the point in holding back millions of people for Paragon or Ensidia personally. If you get it early then my guilds world ranking would go from the 300's to the 500's.. big deal lol.</div></div><hr />

As far as the Vote Kick: I have played WoW for a long time. And just like myself, many of us are getting really tired of these random groups forming where one person just immediately drops out because it wasn't the instance they wanted at that moment or because they have ran the same instance for the past 10-12 times. I wish that they would impliment a longer &quot;Vote Kick&quot; or drop group punishment for those chronic group droppers. It's frustrating as it is just waiting the longer wait times for randoms. But,to compound the wait by some random douchebag that doesn't get what they want is getting intolerable. I know it is alot easier to do things as a guild or at least with a group of people you personally know in real life to gurantee this would never happen. Hopefully this will change in the the future.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Originally i thought it would count all trees and add your bonuses together, so if you had 53 points in combat, with a few points in assasination, you would get a very large passive bonus from combat, but still a small bonus from assasination. <br />
<br />
The new way seems to make talent trees even more limited than before. Everytime you go out of your paticular tree you are missing on passive bonuses, so unless the talent itself is epic, it would work out best to go fully in one tree?<br />
<br />
I was kind of hoping for a situation where you are torn between picking a combat talent and a assination talent, as say the combat skill could be slightly more appealing, but you could really do with a little bit of armor pen. Or something like that.<br />
<br />
Im worried we are going to see even less different talent trees than currently, i thought the idea was to broaden the amount of talent trees that are truely viable :(<br />
<br />
Don't worry, it's not going to happen. As far as I know, you only get the Mastery bonuses only for the first 51 (or so) points in a tree... that means, mastery-wise its not important, if your toon is skilled 51/20/0, 53/15/3 or 71/0/0... in each case you'll only get the 51-points mastery for the first tree and can choose the rest of the talents without sacrificing any mastery-stuff.<br />

I dont know where you found the extended version... as all I can see ends at the warriors down in the bottom corner.<br />
But, I also see Yogg-Sarons tentacle near Frostmourne's hilt, and Im pretty sure the one Warrior has Thunderfury ::)<br />
Also.. wow took me a minute to see C'thun. Kind of interesting.. our first look at an old god without it poking out of the ground.<br />
<br />
I would -love- to see the whole completed work.<br />

3% hit (not sure if they said they're removing it)<br />

<br />
<br />
The problem with doing that way was always hybrids. It makes sense for pure DPS to want to get bonuses from all the trees they have points in. Whatever bonus Assassination gets will almost certainly be helpful for Combat and vice-versa. They probably won't be quite AS good between trees, but they won't be bad or useless either. What about, say Feral Druids? If they put points into Resto they get... Bonus Healing? or they could put points into Balance and get... Bonus Spell damage? Same problem for Resto Druids, Shadow Priests, Holy Pallies, etc. <br />
<br />
There are synergies for classes that have more than one spec that do the same thing. There are even some synergies for tanks with physical DPS specs as possible second trees, but plenty of hybrid classes have at least one spec with no possible synergy tree. It was one of the first thing that some people noted as a problem with tree bonuses and mastery, and the solution works, even if it has same disappointing aspects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as the Vote Kick: I have played WoW for a long time. And just like myself, many of us are getting really tired of these random groups forming where one person just immediately drops out because it wasn't the instance they wanted at that moment or because they have ran the same instance for the past 10-12 times. I wish that they would impliment a longer &quot;Vote Kick&quot; or drop group punishment for those chronic group droppers. It's frustrating as it is just waiting the longer wait times for randoms.

The deserter debuff has been increased to half an hour - that was last patch, I believe.<br />

They -talked- about things, that Boubouille still technically possesses. It's not beyond reason to believe that Blizzard obviously knows the leaks existed. Enforcing such stringent rules on something so fine-grained is beyond inane. If Izhara was permanently banned, then that goes against the original rules that Boub posted to begin with - permanent bans were only outlined in discussion of sandbox/leaked client. Discussion of screenshots only entailed a week long ban, if that, since no actual screenshot was posted. If moderators or administrators are picking-and-choosing, that has nothing to do with the poster themselves.<br />

<br />
'allow warlocks to do a little tanking'<br />
<br />
hooray lol. I know, somebody will reply 'roll a tank noob' to which I reply simply. BAH<br />
<br />
Nah I have a tank, but it is bloody hilarious tanking things like Sind trash as a warlock. keeps the healers on their toes, shocks the tanks. screws the dps when you sit there tanking 20+ mobs doing an easy 30k bwahaha silly mages just try it!<br />
<br />
I'm really glad tho. I mean that 6% in demon form etc, juuuuust about made it work. I can see how this (with the scaling ratings reqs) might mean that later in the xpac, when gear is high we can do go HCs as a tank pretty much (shame we can q as them, I already am a HC ready tank!) as they wont have the rating needs of later stuff.<br />
<br />
I can see why being able to tank sind trash is a bit OTT. (if you havnt, fucking try it ASAP!)<br />
<br />
as a healer i'd have to say that i hope you die in a fire.</div></div><hr />

I'm talking about the amount of pure moronic topics that run rampant here while minor &quot;offenses&quot; are punished as if they've DDOSed the site. You can't look at the &quot;top posts&quot; box without seeing &quot;LOL 3 WORD THREAD&quot; or some other stupid shit that results in either<br />

a. people endlessly quoting the first person<br />

There will still be mandatory talents. We're not really trying to make a talent like Sword and Board optional. We expect most Prot warriors of appropriate level will grab it. Related, we doubt we'll see an end to cookie-cutter specs. As long as the recommended Prot tree says &quot;You must get Sword and Board&quot; then that's essentially a cookie-cutter.<br />
<br />
We would like to accomplish a couple of goals though.<br />
<br />
1) For more casual players (i.e. the ones not posting in this forum), we want there to be less difference in power between an optimal and sub-optimal spec. It's okay if the optimal one is still better, but not so much better. Casual players should feel fine just spending points with a small amount of consideration and not feeling like step one is to go to the Internet to find the right build. The passive bonuses help with that.<br />
<br />
2) For those players that do take optimization very seriously (and I'm assuming most of you are in that category), we just want to see more cookie-cutter builds that say things like &quot;spend the last 5-10 points wherever you want.&quot; If those points would give you survivability or a massive threat bonus or even utility that's hard to live without (say Warbringer for a Prot warrior), then you're not really spending the points where you want. But we think there is room to have some of those choices that don't really exist now. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25172118512/mastery-design-intent/))<br />

I rarely speak of catering the casuals but, WHAT THE FUCK? Seriously, I'm an casual player and under the normal progression for my gear (only 8 down icc 10 and 6 in 25) And I can make spec for any class any spec for pve or pvp that's viable, I find it rather fun to make new specs, but seriously, make those 71/0/0 specced blood dk dps's feel smarter? YAY! More idiots like them as it's viable! OPEN YOUR DAMN EYES AND MAKE THE GAME +15 BY ADDING SOME BLOOD FOR AN EXAMPLE, seriously I've seen more -9 year old people in this game than I've seen in my home town ;E</div></div><hr />

Your solution to fix the game is to add blood? Seriously?<br />
How many times to people have to say that age =/= maturity. <br />
And why should 71/0/0 be an unplayable spec? Sure it won't be an efficient spec or even close to the best spec but an idiot proof way of being sure you've got most mandatory talents is to take them all. Truth is there's plenty of idiots around but i'd rather they not completely ruin my day because they specced wrong.<br />
<br />
On the votekick changes I like the change for people who abandon groups, not sure about the others. Sometimes you just gotta kick someone and i'd rather not feel penalised for doing so.</div></div><hr />

Dunno what the backlash is over Blizzard getting rid of some stats. Most are merely being rolled into the basic stats, in case you forgot a lot these stats were added in TBC. Welcome to Vanilla stats.<br />
<br />
Besides loads need to go anyway, I mean. What's the point of mp5 as a standalone stat, spirit has always been regen. Intellect has always been crit for casters so why do we get gear with crit rating on</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">iorcedurmother</div><div class="date">2010-06-04, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For me trigger happy tanks are the one that rush in pull to much to handle then blame it on the healer and DPS. The ones that try to kick a random person out of the blue without saying a word rather then 'pwnd lmao'. The ones that go bezerk if your grabbing a drink during the loading screen and half a minute after that. The ones that bitch about your DPS while your doing twice+ the dmg of his noob friend. Had alot of decent tanks but for some reason the dickheads seem to be around in equal numbers or more as the nicer ones. Completely agree with you on 200dps slackers and afkers I'm there to get through the instance for xp or badges not to let a leecher get his xp/emblems. Rather point it out first and give him a few tips before kicking someone, makes me/you a lot less the badguy imho. Tbh it isn't a win for slackers at all but for people that value a good fun group and don't use their kicks in a trigger happy way. But I don't have instant tank queue's and have to wait between 1 and 30 minutes for a party. So yes I prefer a good group without all the hassle and bitching.<br />

what kind of fail tanks need heals anymore?</div></div><hr />

Umm I'm guessing by saying this you don't know about Pre Bc Wow as they were all raids from it, but Onyxia and Kel'Thuzad were moved to Wotlk and what I think &quot;raggy&quot; will be used in Cataclysm</div></div><hr />
