The Evolution of World of Warcraft Storytelling<br />
ScienceAlert has posted a three part interview with Alex Afrasiabi called &quot;How Warcraft Builds Towards Stories Players Care About.&quot; We previously covered Part 1 here (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7811-Level-40-100-XP-Nerf-Epic-Battlegrounds-Feedback-Quest-Storytelling-Level-40-100-XP-Nerf-Epic-Battlegrounds-Feedback-Quest-Storytelling).<br />
<br />
Part 2 (https://www.sciencealert.com/world-of-warcraft-lore-storytelling-history-future-alex-afrasiabi-interview-part-2)<br />
<br />
Before Mists of Pandaria, the team would only plan one expansion ahead of time for the story, but now they keep the previous and future expansions in mind when telling the story. <br />
There is some truth to forum posts that say &quot;WoW's running out of bosses to kill. The Warcraft 3 well is nearly dry.&quot;<br />
It took a couple expansions to take Garrosh from a relatively unknown character to a boss.<br />
Saurfang was added just to be an NPC to turn in Onyxia's head to. Alex wrote his gossip text at three in the morning and it turned into who we know today.<br />
New expansions allows the team to create new heroes and new villains for us to face.<br />
The lore team helps to keep facts straight for storytelling.<br />
The Chronicles are historical, so they are helpful for fact checking WoW's history and providing inspiration for the story.<br />
Story is a motivational factor in the things that you do and your actions in the world. It gives them consequence, weight, and adds emotion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Part 3 (https://www.sciencealert.com/warcraft-lore-story-future-alex-afrasiabi-battle-for-azeroth-interview-part-3) <br />
<br />
At the start of an expansion, the team talks about what expansion is going to be about, the primary characters, the direction they're heading, and the tones and themes.<br />
From there, all of the books, novellas, comics, short stories, audio books, and all of that stuff originates from the game team.<br />
Alex tells the designers to not depend upon quest text to tell their story or the story of the world and the characters.<br />
The team should focus on when they have the player captive and able to listen, versus hit accept and move on and follow the quest map to check off the things on the list.<br />
The team wants to continue to try to and improve the ways in which they deliver the story so that you aren't bound by WoWpedia or the quest text.<br />
The goal is for players to feel something, so that may be anger, happiness, sadness, excitement, or other emotions. <br />

The full quote is actually <br />
<br />
<br />
Focus on those moments where you have the player captive, where they're actually able to listen versus hit accept and move on and follow the quest map to check off the things on the list.<br />
<br />
They are not saying that in every quest players should read in to the quest more than just bunch of objectives. What he is saying is that designers should focus telling story on quests where players actually want to see what the quest text says.<br />

Yeah. Fortnite is the first game ever to have pop culture references like *grabs popcorn* introduced into it.<br />

I bet they will steal things like dancing and finding loot out in the world too to make it even more fortnity!<br />

WoW has always done this.<br />
If they see something interesting or something that works well in another game, they'll migrate it into Wow if possible.<br />
But this is also how the entire game industry works.<br />

The funny thing about that is, that it's not even right, I mean they've done it since Cataclysm, with both Garrosh and the Cataclysm itself that lead to MoP, which lead to WoD, which lead to Legion etc. It's true that there wasn't a real conenction between Vanilla-TBC-Wotlk, aside from Garrosh really, but aside from that? Nothing. So wierd that they can't see that themselves</div></div><hr />

I think there's a problem with the idea that there would ever be quests whose text is so irrelevant you just skip it. I mean, that's partly why players skip the text. How many different reasons can there be for 10 boar livers/broken scrap/poop/whatever until youre just like &quot;ok whatever you need 10 poops, I don't even want to know why and I couldn't care less&quot;.<br />
<br />
There's way too much &quot;questing glut&quot; in the game.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has a real long history on &quot;borrowing&quot; things from other games and pop culture. So not entirely out of place. Hell a lot of them probably play the game themselves.<br />

<br />
That explains why they've gotten so good as of late of cramming very dense storytelling into cutscenes. Hell, the entire arc of Illidan and Velen's bromance was told in two cutscenes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't take that long to develop a character though. I thought they did a good job with Yrel in WoD just through the questing content. As for running out of WC3 characters, WoW is 14 years old, they've had plenty of time to create and develop new ones. The problem is they keep pulling from the same lore pool without any sort of replenishment system in place, so of course it's running dry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes its almost dry, but also time to move on. <br />
We actually write history ourselves now. In 3 years, new players learn how Sylvanas attacked Teldrassil.<br />
From that story new heroes and villains were created, which we probably fight against in some raid.<br />
<br />
And enough old content to continue with.<br />
- Bolvar (WotLK2)<br />
- Dragonflights (Emerald Dream, who is aspect of what? Thrall?)<br />
- Draenor (Farahlon, Ogre land, perhaps some new continent)<br />
- Outlands (Maybe more continents survived?)<br />
- The blue child (maybe some area's on the moon?)<br />
- Other worlds (Saw some nice worlds in the invasion points. We could free them from the remaining rebel legion forces)<br />
<br />
Let's see what they will give us :)</div></div><hr />

Well, that's the thing with objectivity. everyone and their mother can think one thing, and another can think another. funny that isn't it. <br />

your anecdotal evidence of what you and some other sweaty groups think means very little to my enjoyment of the game.. your comments remind me of this.<br />

You are upset that people are enjoying it, despite YOU thinking it's crap. once again you forget the forums do not mean everything. they are a small vocal minority. the people enjoying the content, are out there doing just that. so of COURSE it looks bad on forums.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Popcorn<br />
Eating popcorn<br />
Air drops<br />
opening Airdrops<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Its not like popcorn was invented long long long ago, and eating popcorn has been a joke for literally since its inception.<br />
that or that air drops are a real world thing that have happened for a long time now, or have been in many games before fortnite like Pubg, Arma, battlefield, call of duty all the way back to its first kill streak airdrop.<br />
but hey ima just sit here eating my popcorn with a meme that totally stole from fortnite.<br />

<br />
Having never played Fortnite, I was under the assumption the airdrop thing was stolen from GTA5 if anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
your anecdotal evidence of what you and some other sweaty groups think means very little to my enjoyment of the game.. your comments remind me of this.<br />

You are upset that people are enjoying it, despite YOU thinking it's crap. once again you forget the forums do not mean everything. they are a small vocal minority. the people enjoying the content, are out there doing just that. so of COURSE it looks bad on forums.<br />
<br />
Actually he is not the minority, even the sites are pointing out that you need to reach out of the game to get a &quot;better&quot; storytelling instead. Which is the oposite of what it used to be before all the focus shift into their books/novels business (it started in Cataclysm). Even cinematics and some cutscenes are now released outside of the game (while it used to be played in-game after a certain point into the quest line) with parts that should be in-game (like Saurfang pointing out Sylvanas' mistake when burning the tree). First impression matters, so it's not that good to have a cinematic/cutscene/book/novel released later to &quot;hey, here is the missing key stuff that explains the out of nowhere stuff happening in-game&quot;.<br />
<br />
We've got to the point of having Blizzard say something about it. The game is really bland/simple with the storytelling today. Maybe this is why some people say they're enjoying now, since it has less and less story/text and more &quot;no time to explain champion, go from a to b, here is your reward&quot;.</div></div><hr />
