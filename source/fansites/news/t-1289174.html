<br />
I got the idea from the name - 'mantle' being a commonly used name for shoulder pieces. Combine that with 'sightless', and it's easy to see why one would arrive at such a conclusion.<br />
<br />
I mean, most people can barely even see the shirt you're wearing, if you're wearing one at all, because of the chest piece you have on. And even when they can see a bit of it, you need to go into inspect to actually have any clue as to what the shirt is most of the time. So shirts on their own don't seem a really good way of showing such 'prestige' as a vanity item. <br />
<br />
Now look at someone and see that they don't have any shoulder armour and you can instantly tell that they have said Brawler's Guild item. Far more efficient.<br />
<br />
The addition of the transmog shoes that turn your shoes invisible shows Blizz is a bit more open to adding items like this that hide armour parts too.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it's a bloody weird name for a shirt if it really IS just a shirt.</div></div><hr />

It's not about how the shirt looks, Precious' Ribbon gives you a vanity buff, which shows as the icon of the shirt (a ribbon) and has tooltip &quot;Best in Show&quot;. I presume this will work similiarly.<br />
<br />
While &quot;mantle&quot; is commonly used for shoulders in this game, it has also been used for shirts (Primitive Mantle (http://www.wowhead.com/item=6134)), a chest Goblin Primitive's Mantle (http://www.wowhead.com/item=49517) and cloaks Mantle of Stormwind (http://www.wowhead.com/item=64901). A cloak is probably the closest thing to the right usage of the word (I think it's sort of a long shawl).<br />
<br />
While this is not as evenly distributed as for example &quot;greaves&quot; which is used for both Legs and Boots (in reality, they're shinguards) kinda evenly, one should still not presume that a Shirt piece would affect shoulders just because of an ambiguous name...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I wasn't aware it'd been used for anything other than shoulders - thanks for clearing that up.<br />
<br />
Yeah I guess I was clutching at straws a bit in my hope that it was finally an option to disable the damn shoulders. Shame really. It'd have been the perfect type of vanity reward for something like the Brawler's Guild. Far better than having a little meaningless 'buff' appear in the top right-hand corner of your screen that no one else will really notice unless they checked for it.</div></div><hr />

If you, say, complete the quests on a Horde character and earn the title, do you unlock the Alliance title counterpart for your Alliance characters, or one must have lvl90s on both factions and do both sides of the quests if he wants to earn both titles to his account?<br />
If the faction-specific scenarios are anything to go by, you'll be able to do the opposing questline in the following patch cycle.</div></div><hr />

Wow... just... wow.<br />

Feral Spirit wolves are now immune to movement-impairing effects.<br />

Hmm ... Glad I don't PVP anymore I suppose.<br />
Eh, for the most part their values haven't been upped since WotLK.</div></div><hr />

With that said, I am NOT a fan of nerfing Warlock Water Walking and Water Strider Walking. Its about as necessary as having a thumb on my neck. (Which I will be getting removed soon)</div></div><hr />

It was one of few mounts that I liked purely based on its water walking abilities. Ah well, I suppose it won't be that easy to get away from Isle of thunder mobs :-)</div></div><hr />

Most of the time when you walk on water with it, it is over a large lake or stretch of ocean where there are no mobs to begin with.</div></div><hr />
