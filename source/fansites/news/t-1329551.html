Patch 5.4 - Heirloom Raid Weapons<br />
Along with all of the other Siege of Orgrimmar loot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-build=17260&amp;filter-quality=16), Patch 5.4 adds some Heirloom weapons that drop from Garrosh (ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-bind=10&amp;filter-patch=3388&amp;filter-ilvl-min=500&amp;filter-quality=16). These items do not drop in Raid Finder difficulty, only Flex, Normal, and Heroic. Keep in mind that nothing on the PTR is final until it goes live.<br />

General<br />
<br />
Wild Mushroom (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/88747) for Restoration Druids now summons a single mushroom at the friendly target’s location. If the mushroom is recast, the mushroom moves to the new location and retains its accumulated bonus healing.<br />
<br />
The amount of healing stored on a Wild Mushroom (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/88747) is now reduced by Battle Fatigue.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talents<br />
<br />
Dream of Cenarius (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108373) has been completely redesigned to reduce complexity and increase usability, but maintain the spirit of the effects. Benefits now vary by specialization.<br />
<br />
Guardian: Increases the amount healed by Healing Touch (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5185) by 20%. Increases the critical strike chance of Mangle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/33878) (Bear) by 10% and critical strikes of Mangle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/33878) (Bear) have a 40% chance to make the next Healing Touch (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5185) or Rebirth (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20484) instant, free, and castable in all forms. Instant cast version of Healing Touch (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5185) now benefits from Attack Power instead of Spell Power.<br />

<br />
Rushing Jade Wind (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116847): The Monk summons a whirling tornado around them, dealing damage to nearby enemies (heals nearby allies for Mistweavers). Rushing Jade Wind (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116847) has the same costs, Chi generation, and periodic rate as Spinning CRake (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1822) Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1766), but, deals 60% of the periodic damage or healing, lasts 6 seconds, is instant, and not channeled.<br />

Raid Testing Schedule - August 8-9<br />
On Thursday, August 8, and Friday, August 9, we will continue testing raid encounters in the Siege of Orgrimmar raid. We're moving on to 10-player Heroic testing at this time, and then 25-player mode as the PTR cycle progresses.<br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below for all Public Test Realms.<br />
<br />
Thursday, August 8<br />
Immerseus - 10 Player Heroic - 10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br />
Norushen - 10 Player Heroic - 16:00 PDT (19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Friday, August 9<br />
Spoils of Pandaria - 10 Player Heroic - 10:30 PDT (13:30 EDT, 19:30 CEST)<br />
Paragons of the Klaxxi - 10 Player Heroic - 16:00 PDT (19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

Instead you did the exact opposite and went to a complete standstill. Main heroes mostly do nothing at all.<br />
Characters like Garrosh and Jaina have a lot of presence in the 5.0 story. Now, you may not like them or wish we had included more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363732251055357952))<br />
<br />
Wotlk had the highest integration of players to the story. Cata and mop had arguably none or really week.<br />
We also heard criticism that Arthas turned up every time you opened a closet. Risked making him feel more annoying than frightening. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363731928530161664))<br />
<br />
Real question, what is the intrinsic value of content? Story/Aesthetic difficulty matters less.<br />
Seeing content and seeing story are both rewards. In WoW, gear just tends to be a more motivating reward for many. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363411281815928834))<br />
<br />
I have a feeling that y'shaarj is the true baddie in this expansion amirite?<br />
He is dead. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/345673427400683520))<br />
How can Old Gods die if &quot;They're outside the cycle&quot;?<br />
&quot;What is dead may never die?&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363402324854587392))<br />
<br />
stop saying u lose a leveling zone when u can phase for hight levels like u do on Theramor<br />
Okay, so you're asking for Ashenvale to be phased at higher level to reinforce Alliance winning back some land? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/363402074769207297))<br />
<br />
Just trying to understand how the ongoing story makes sense after changes such as this - esp for lower level toons<br />
We often have a problem with the lower level time flow. Arthas is dead 1-60 then alive 61-80 then dead again 80-90. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/361996419105685504))<br />
Why not turn TBC &amp; WotLK into optional content that can be played in scenarios / cavern of times?<br />
It's a neat idea. It just takes designer time away from other ideas (which doesn't mean it's off the table). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362359190649438209))<br />
<br />
World<br />
Can we get a list of to-be-joined servers in 5.4 so we can start matching guilds/arena teams up? Thanks!<br />
There are no Arena teams any longer. We'll provide lists of connected realms when we have resolved which ones are affected. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/362450562370904065))<br />

The Burdens of Shaohao<br />

I would not be surprised (If this even goes live) for the weapons to require you to have killed Garrosh on the character you use them on. (Probably on the difficulty relative to the piece) This restriction would probably be lifted at the start of next expansion so that people can use them to level with. On top of that, the Flex/Normal/Heroic tags on them probably wont matter once you start leveling, since they will probably all scale to end up the exact same at max level.<br />
<br />
There are literally 10,000 unanswered questions about these, so I highly suggest people completely forget they exist until Blizzard confirms that they, in fact, exist.</div></div><hr />

Enchants are supposed to scale with ilvl in the next patch so supposedly you can stick the best enchants on an ilvl one although they will be scaled down. Twinkers might not like that so much than again how many are left.<br />

Deathwing showed up plenty. The problem was that he was completely uninteresting in those appearances. The Thunder King isn't all that interesting...but he isn't the expansion's end boss. Garrosh is, and I thought he's been highlighted quite well. There hasn't been a raid boss I've wanted to kill this badly since Arthas.</div></div><hr />

My guess is that Heirloom weapons main reason is the carrot for flex raiding. They just couldn't have a reward for flex that normal/heroic raid had not access too. I think it is a nice reward to motivate people go one step further than LFR and I hope in the future that flex will completely replace the LFR nonsence. Heirloom weapons is not only for leveling in the next xpac, as more people seem to focus their comments, but also a nice source of gear for alts. Imagine an alt character that will hit 90 and immediately have access to one of those weapons...<br />
<br />
My view to the next patch is very positive.<br />
<br />
pros:<br />
-no focus on dailies<br />
-flex raiding<br />
-&quot;merge&quot; servers<br />
-catch up mechanism for the new level 90s (chests on the new island, new pvp gear)<br />
<br />
Especially the new direction they take with weeklies and currency farming instead of dailies is very encouraging :) <br />
<br />
cons:<br />
-new recipes will again be aquired by daily research...(is a pain for leatherworker..I still didn't discovered all the previous ones, cause they are almost double than Blacksmithing/tailoring)<br />
<br />
In the next xpac I was hoping that along with the item squish maybe there is a chance for level squish too cause 95 or100 as a number is very discouraging...Although it seems they are increasing the cap again. I am sure they will nerf xp from previous xpacs more so people will reach more easy to the new cap, but this is not a solution I think..it will cause more problems, since we already outleves zones before we finish the quests..</div></div><hr />

You knew who he was and wanted to kill him? I didn't. I thought he was ridiculous, showing up everywhere and failing to kill us all the time. Come on, he never tried to kill us himself, because he was 'oh so good, we were beneath him' and instead created or summoned some bad dude that we killed in under 30 seconds. He was underwhelming and weak in my eyes and I had no idea he was supposed to be so powerful.

What makes you think they won't change anything about talents for the next expansion? They could just tack an extra talent on at 95 or 100, or start talents at lvl 5 or 20 and continue going every 15, or make them every 10 lvls and add more tiers, or ANYTHING... They've said that they want to avoid lvl 100 because it's a magic number that feels like it should be the end of the game.

Honestly it would take less effort then phrasing Theramore. No new art assets are really required, just removing or adding a few stock NPC's.Just curious, where's that sudden interest and care from Alliance players in Ashenvale coming from? For all those years I play the game, the Alliance players gave less than a flying fuck about that zone (and Darkshore). The only ones playing there were Night Elfs and some Draenei (with TBC release). Kalimdor was always kind of a step child to Alliance, but the north of Kalimdor was almost entirely disregarded. <br />
<br />
So a revamp/phasing for the sheer principle of a positive gesture? Then nope... Spend devs time more efficient than that. <br />
<br />
This is coming from someone who is waiting for years to finally get some Night Elf story in the game.... So if anything, I should support a retake of Ashenvale, which I do.. But please in the right way, and not miraculously. Read: The retake should take place within the appropriate level of the players questing there. And not for the pleasure of some players who don't give a shit about Ashenvale anyway.</div></div><hr />

Not to mention for those of us with 12 or more 90's 5 is so much easier on the psyche, 60 total levels rather than 120!! For sure this time tho, I'm going to max them AFTER the XP nerf, I did my 12th one 1 week before the nerf this time, what a waste of time LOL.<br />
<br />
Please show me statistics where more players hated 10 levels?<br />
No?? not got none...good then stop talking shit.<br />
<br />
Also who's problem is it that you have multiple chars to level?? not mine not anyone elses or blizzards.<br />
Posts like this are pathetic, stating your own opinion and trying to pass it off as everyone elses.<br />
<br />
I said other day in the heirloom thread, 10 levels probably compensates somehow with the item squish.</div></div><hr />

Considering they drop in flex and normal mode I honestly don't see the reason to complain about them focusing on raiding. This is a PVE game after all and after the daily debacle they actually gave us a lot of non pvp oriented content this expansion so far. If you are mad over pvp not getting a lot of love well then shame on you for thinking this game is all about the pvp. It upset me for a while when pvp started being its on meta instead of intertwining them both but I honestly don't see a problem with this. Flex raiding will be easier than normal(which normal modes are already easy). Cry somewhere else.</div></div><hr />

I'm sick and tired of this game being nothing but raiding and PVP in a box.<br />

Wonder why Blizzard is losing subs by the truckload?<br />
a) competition - specially F2P<br />
b) stupidly narrow focus, pouring vast majority of their resources into &quot;hardcore&quot; activities like raiding and Arena; giving their competitors plenty of &quot;money on the table&quot; to grab, giving players tons of gameplay, tired of one game switch to another, that they don't even have to pay for if they don't want to.<br />
<br />
You are suffering from the same mental myopia Blizzard is, where raiding and PVP are the only things in the world. Might as well instance the whole game, because instances are where players spend 90% of their time - the other 10% being the cities. Might as well go play GW1 where everything is instanced.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it really sucks that people with more skill and determination than you will have an advantage. It's almost like it's a reward for work. There is nothing stopping anyone from getting these. Not like it matters, realm first always goes to people who had help.<br />

They've already said 2 expansions. So it will be 90-95, and 95-100.<br />

<br />
Keep in mind, the weapons shown are the heroic versions. The news article says they will drop from Flex, Normal, and Heroic. Meanwhile, what we've known about BoA items is that they are USUALLY equal in strength to a blue weapon for that level. (Not saying they absolutely will be, but just mentioning it.)<br />
<br />
Both Normal and Flex weapons will be weaker than the ones shown in the picture. Then, depending on how they scale up (whether they stay heroic raid level, or back down to blue-level weapons) you may not even WANT to use them past level 90.</div></div><hr />

He was underwhelming and weak in my eyes and I had no idea he was supposed to be so powerful. It was like some sniper pointing his red laser on you all the time shouting 'haha, could have killed you there, but I didn't, because I am bad ass!' and in the end you kill him with a knife.<br />
<br />
Well if you remember the RP from killing the Lich King, he explains why he did that. He was testing us so he knew when we showed up before him in his house that we were the best of the best and therefore killed us to raise us as his minions to fight under his control.</div></div><hr />

Raiding and Arena are FAR from hardcore. They just give rewards for you know being good at them(elite transmog gear for pvp and in this case a heirloom weapon?)<br />
<br />
While I agree that it stinks that the world is &quot;dead&quot; compared to tbc/vanilla(though it's not really dead Mop gets you out into it), I can't say that all they focus on is raiding and pvp. You obviously have not read the same patch notes about a decent amount of non raiding based stuff to do. They aren't losing subs because of more options going F2P. They are losing subs because the game is going on nine years old. Outside of Tera and Rift the rest of the F2P mmo's are for the most part crap. So competition isn't really much. <br />
<br />
I'm definitely not in the same mental myopia as Blizzard however. This game was founded and still thrives due to the raiding game. Once they stop focusing on that this game will die quickly. That is until Titan comes out.</div></div><hr />

Who says it'll scale better then current Heirlooms? The jump from level 90 to 91 probably won't increase the stats much. The only time the weapon might be 'overpowered' is at level 90 - and that's assuming the Heirloom version will keep the stats of the Epic version.</div></div><hr />

I don't see the problem...They drop in everything but LFR....Flex uses the LFR loot system. Normal and Heroic are usually dedicated groups(even if pugs) consistently going every week with the same 12-30 people depending on raid size.

Where would they be &quot;needing&quot; on these things? In flex where it uses LFR's loot system or in Normal/Heroic where 95% of the groups are using loot master? In loot master it goes to people in raid first and if nobody needs it for primary then, depending on the group, secondary/alts. Or you can say alts are after secondary spec. Really don't see any issues.</div></div><hr />

BoA weapons same ilvl as SoO gear, heirloom scaling or not, goes live: Then people, especially hardcore raiders, will feel &quot;forced&quot; or at least attracted to the idea of leveling and gearing 10 alts to run Flex AND Normal/Heroic SoO every week to get a weapon for their main. This is an awful idea that promotes tedium.<br />
<br />
The maximum ilvl of these should be greatly decreased, at least down to 530 (2/2 normal mode weapon from T15) to prevent people from doing this for anything more than catch-up.</div></div><hr />

Supposedly!? No. You have no basis to assume that Blizz would all of a sudden for no reason whatsoever stop selling expansions for their multi-billion business.<br />

Stop making crazy assumptions out of nothing.<br />

90-100 means nothing, except that they want it to be available for, most likely 2 more expansions, but not for the expansions after that. Just like heirlooms have always had an upper limit.</div></div><hr />

Nobody should have an advantage, it's a fresh start like it has always been, why change that now?<br />
<br />
Fresh start.... LOL<br />
<br />
As if a fully geared heroic raider does not have a HUGE advantage over Joe Shmoe at expansion launch... Beyond leveling, there is no reason to assume they would be better than any other level 100 weapon, just like any other heirloom.<br />

These items do not drop in Raid Finder difficulty, only Flex, Normal, and Heroic. Keep in mind that nothing on the PTR is final until it goes live.<br />
<br />
This makes no sense to me, yes I understand that the higher difficulties are supposed to feel like they get something extra, the extra shouldn't be Heirloom pieces, people that are limited to RF have less endgame content therefore would more focused on alt leveling, which benefits Heirlooms more than just running a main up with it on the next XPac, and letting it sit in your bank until that Main toon is maxed out, to then decide to level another alt.</div></div><hr />

Just because level 100 exists does not mean new expansions won't come out, they can add plenty of other unique types of character progression and more content that surpasses older content of the same level similar to how raiding is now with progression.</div></div><hr />

If you have the time to level alts you should take that time and go do some flex raiding. In the real world you'll learn one day that putting in effort gives you more rewards.</div></div><hr />

This is going to suck for realm first race if heroic raiders get to keep their heroic scaling weapon, especially warriors and dks who scale very heavy with weapons.<br />

You fail to see my point, all I care for is leveling and realm first not anything beyond that. As for heroic gear, yeah you are right. However weapons scale a little too good for melee classes especially warriors and death knights. This will allow said group of people who have these items to steamroll their way to max level. Which should not happen like in previous expansions.<br />

I work a lot of late shifts at unconventional times and they change back and forth a lot so its never the same. Fact of the matter is, getting into a raid team for regular raiding for me is close to impossible. Does that mean because of time constraints on my part, I shouldn't get anything because I can't put the effort in to follow a raid schedule?<br />
<br />
Like the guy you quoted said. By all means have exclusive mounts, epics, floating heads, companions - Whatever. But I feel heirlooms are a bad idea in regards to Flex, normal and heroic only raid loot, as for somebody like me - Alt'ing is important.</div></div><hr />

Activation chances and internal cooldowns for those effects and other trinket effects have been adjusted to compensate and will now be displayed on their tooltip.<br />
<br />
So what is this change about? Sounds like it is to prevent haste double dipping with some add-proc setbonuses, where the adds not only spawn more frequently, but also scale with haste and do more attacks, but I have no clue why are the rest included, as none of those double dip in any way. They could have just said &quot;RPPM procs wont scale with haste anymore&quot; and it would be much clearer what their intention is.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like flex raiding is for you. It's easy and puggable, you don't have to maintain a schedule. There are even tools out there like open raid to assist you with this kind of stuff. Your argument holds no water, you're saying because of time constraints you shouldn't be barred from parts of the game. So because you have time constraints why aren't you angry that you can't have heroic gear? The people who put more effort into the game and have more time to blow will get the better rewards, it's always been this way. If you don't have time for this game stick to lfr and stop whining about how lame the rewards are. You're playing the game on insane easy mode, imo you shouldn't even be given gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But on topic: What tickles my brainz the most is the question of how these will be looted.... dropps rolled on for everyone like normal loot, or chance to get as own personal loot like the legendary quest items (altho that wouold be kinda weird imo).<br />
<br />
What ever they choose to do I predict loot drama happening here and there because of off specs, alts etc. :p</div></div><hr />
