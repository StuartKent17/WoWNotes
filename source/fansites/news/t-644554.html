Ulduar Hard Mode Encounters Hotfixed<br />
That's interesting, Blizzard spent the last years releasing new dungeons and nerfing them after some time but we didn't see them buffing a lot of encounters in the past. It looks like they didn't want people to beat the hard modes so fast and a lot of them are getting buffed, including Freya, Thorim, and General Vezax. The Hall of Fame (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=864) will be cleared for these bosses. <br />
4/17/09<br />
Totem of the Dancing Flame should no longer cause a target affected by Stormstrike to take additional damage.<br />
Maim should no longer be removable with Berserker Rage.<br />
Piercing Shots will now cause the correct amount of damage against shielded targets.<br />
The healing a Death Knight receives from damage done by Death Strike has been reduced.<br />
Earthen Power will now properly be applied on the first pulse of an Earthbind Totem.<br />
The paladin ability Vengeance can no longer be spellstolen.<br />
The Twilight Whelps on the Sartharion encounter will now properly come outside of the twilight realm.<br />
<br />
Ulduar<br />
Several changes to the Razorscale encounter have been made including the range and damage of the Dark Rune Watcher’s Chain Lightning being reduced, and the radius of Razorscale’s Devouring Flame being slightly reduced.<br />
To increase the challenge, Hodir’s hard mode should need to be completed faster than before and the bonus of the Moonlight buff that NPCs provide to players should be decreased.<br />
The damage done by Thorim and Sif in hard mode has been increased in multiple ways.<br />
Freya has had her health and damage increased in hard mode in multiple ways.<br />
The Ignis the Furnace encounter has received several changes. To make his individual hits less devastating, we reduced his overall melee damage by about 15% but he swings faster now. In normal mode we increased the cooldown of Activate Construct from 30 to 40 seconds. We also decreased the damage of the Scorch ground effect by 20% on both difficulties.<br />
XT-002 Deconstructor’s health and damage has been slightly increased in hard mode.<br />
XT-002 Deconstructor will no longer cast Light Bomb or Gravity Bomb while channeling Tympanic Tantrum.<br />
For the trash leading up to Ignis the Furnace Master, the Magma Rager’s Superheated Winds have had their speed reduced. The normal mode Molten Colossus have had the cooldown of Pyroblast increased.<br />
The trash mobs leading to Mimiron can now see through stealth/invisible, no more sneaking past.<br />
In the General Vezax encounter on hard mode, the Saronite Animus’s Profound Darkness will now hit harder.<br />
Ignis the Furnace Master should no longer melee players he is grabbing.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/deathknight.jpg Death Strike Healing Nerf<br />
We hotfixed a change to the amount of healing provided by Death Strike.<br />
<br />
Originally, this ability was something you would use only situationally to heal yourself at a cost of damage. Since then we have redesigned the death knight class sufficiently to where Death Strike was a major rotational ability for Blood. Given how much the attack is hitting for, we think the amount of healing it provided was too much.<br />
<br />
Healing still scales based on diseases and the damage is unchanged. Blood retains its other tools to heal. <br />
<br />
Armor Penetration Mechanics<br />
Ghostcrawler is being very nice and posted the exact formulas for the calculation of Armor Penetration Rating. It doesn't happen very often and I'm sure it will make a few theorycrafters VERY happy. <br />
Okay, here is a fairly technical explanation we put together for how armor pen works.<br />
<br />
We didn’t want Armor Penetration Rating to be too powerful against low armor targets, like it had been in BC. We also didn’t want Armor Penetration Rating to be too powerful against high armor targets.<br />
<br />
So, we decided on a system where there is a cap on how much armor the Armor Penetration Rating can be applied to. So, the first X armor on the target is reduced by the percentage listed in the Armor Penetration Rating tooltip, and all armor past that X is unaffected. Another way of understanding that is we multiply the percentage in the tooltip times the minimum of the two values: the cap, and the amount of armor on the target after all other modifiers.<br />
<br />
Computing the cap is a little tricky unless you are already familiar with how World of Warcraft armor works. There is an armor constant we’ll call C. C is derived as follows (in some pseudocode):<br />
<br />
If (level&lt;60)<br />
C=400+85*targetlevel<br />
Else<br />
C=400+85*targetlevel+4.5*85*(targetlevel-59);<br />
<br />
For a level 80 target, C=15232.5. For a level 83, C=16635.<br />
<br />
The cap for Armor Penetration then is: (armor + C)/3.<br />
<br />
A level 80 warrior creature has 9729 armor. C=15232.5. So, the cap is (9729+15232.5)/3=8320.5. Let’s say a player has 30% armor penetration from armor penetration rating and no other modifiers that complicate the calculation (talents, Battle Stance, Sunder Armor, etc.). The game chooses the minimum of 8320.5 and 9729, so 8320.5. That is multiplied by 30% = 2496.15, and so that much armor is ignored. The effective armor on the target is 7232.85 (9729-2496.15). From a player point of view, the armor penetration rating didn’t ignore the full 30%, but instead ignored 25.66%. (85.5% as effective as expected).<br />
<br />
These equations should help you be able to test and verify that Armor Penetration Rating is working correctly and as we designed. The tooltip is not actually inaccurate, as it states: “Enemy armor reduced by up to 30.00%.” That &quot;up to&quot; is key.<br />
<br />
Please be sure to test without any other effects which modify the armor calculation (Battle Stance, Sunder Armor, Mace Specialization, etc.) as they may involve other systems that add additional complexity to the calculation. <br />

Cooking<br />
Chef's Hat very high cost<br />
Flavor items can often cost a lot, like the Cenarion War Hippgryph when it was first introduced and the those mammoths from the Sons of Hodir. We don't feel the the need to add special function to things just because they are expensive. I know a number of players who are interested in the hat just for the look and that's what we were going for. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16473908492-new-chefs-hat.html))<br />

The Murkimus pet will be rewarded to all characters on eligible accounts. This should happen around the middle of May. <br />

Ulduar<br />
Ulduar 10-Man Difficulty<br />
You should be able to do 10-player Ulduar with 10-player Naxx gear. You will most likely find it more challenging than Naxx however. The encounter team has been making dozens of tweaks to the content when they find something bugged or over or under-tuned. It's a little hard to tell at this stage if players who are struggling are running into bugs or overtuned encounters or if they just haven't mastered the mechanics yet. There are no tank and spank boss encounters in Ulduar. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16474308271-10-man-raid-progression.html))<br />
<br />
Ulduar-25 Man Difficulty<br />
I think some of you are assuming that since you aren't rolling over the 10-player version that the 25 version must somehow be easier. It's not. Yes it is being cleared, but so far by guilds like Ensidia, Vodka and Premonition. Those are some of the best of the best, and none of them managed it in a three hour run. They will however get to the point where they can farm it, and so will you.<br />
<br />
Hard modes are a different story.<br />
<br />
And again, in those cases where something is overtuned or bugged, the designers are getting fixes turned around really quickly. Give it a few more tries before you declare it too challenging. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/16474308271-10-man-raid-progression.html))<br />

Class balancing on 3.1 live realms<br />
We're not done with balance. We had some great guilds participating on the PTR, but that's no comparison to the thousands of players that will be participating in the 3.1 content &quot;for real&quot; now. As issues arise, we'll address them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474238576-now-that-31-is-live-is-blizz-done.html))<br />

Gargoyle lasts 25 seconds instead of 40 according to the tooltip<br />
Gargoyle is working as intended. Because of the way it works some of the tooltips are never going to be totally accurate. To be honest. the entire spell is a little complex and I'm not sure we get much from that complexity. We have discussed changing it to something simpler (like no RP over time or something). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474328702-if-you-can-hotfix-deathstrike.html))<br />

Dual-Wield spec nerf<br />
This is one of those categories, like the Conflag nerf, that we feel like you have options. We needed to kill the DW spec where you pretty much ignore weapons and just try and proc big spells. That was not the DW DK style we wanted. We felt like we had a choice between OP DW DKs and no DW DKs and thought the second was a more acceptable risk.<br />
<br />
As we have explained, one of our ideas long term is to give Frost a couple of DW talents. It might not take much more than &quot;Your Frost Striks and Oblits now hit with two weapons.&quot; Having 3 tanking and PvP trees is challenging enough. Expanding that matrix by also having DW Blood PvP and DW Unholy tanking gets to the insane level. But having DW Frost PvP, DW Frost PvE and DW Frost tanking (only) may be more manageable. We are not at all sure if this is the approach we will use, but it's an idea.<br />
<br />
DKs were overpowered in a few ways. Fixing that was more important thank keeping DW at equal dps to 2H. That does not mean we have given up on DW for DKs in the same way that we no longer support 2H for Enhancement shamans. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474158678-dk-dual-wield-dps-too-low-and-no1-cares.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We would not turn Frost into a DW tree. We would just make sure all DW DKs were Frost. And again, this is just an idea. We may reject it for some reason. As I have said many times, we want DKs to be a class that uses 2H or DW. We do not want DW to dominate, as it typically does in classes that have that option.

Spell damage for Death Knights<br />
Some spell damage is fine, and an interesting niche for them, but they are designed primarily as a melee class. When you face Arthas, I guarantee he is going to hit you hard with Frostmourne. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16474158678-dk-dual-wield-dps-too-low-and-no1-cares.html))<br />

Conflagrate nerf<br />
If we could go back in time, we would have nerfed it before the build went live. We hoped the changes we put into place would be enough. They were not. Remember, the PTR does not represent every single build we make.<br />
<br />
Given that we didn't change it before 3.1 went live, these kind of threads seem to be &quot;Well you missed your chance -- now you're not allowed to fix it,&quot; which seems a peculiar argument to me.

The projected textures on Rain of Fire etc. cannot be turned on. We had to remove them for perfomance reasons, but want to get them turned back on again soon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16418332611-rain-of-fire-and-blizzard-broken.html))</div></div><hr />

But serious, removing the effort that those guilds had on it, and the ones that went for that aswell, such as Method, is just pathetic.<br />
The current Hard Modes weren't exactly a walk in a park, if other guilds wanted world 1st they should have killed them 1st, simple as that. Removing it from Hall of Fame is just hillarious and ONCE AGAIN a way to bring Ensidia to the top and they did nothing for it.<br />
<br />
If we go by that, Hall of Fame for Yogg-Saron should also be cleared and only Yogg-Saron Hard Mode added to it, since Yogg-Saron normal is so fucking easy, eh?<br />

Let the people that actually didn't go for a super fast clear get credit for it imo. How can you justify that the guilds that did kill before Blizzard gave some of the bosses an unexpected buff now are lost in the competition? <br />
They are locked to that instance - they can't kill after the buff was applied.<br />
<br />
Now if the bosses were reset so the few guilds that did actually manage to kill them on hardmode got a chance to do so again - then maybe I could understand. But to say to these guilds - sorry - we are changing the rules. You did beat the encounter fair and square, you didn't choose the easy way, you did everything exactly as you were suposed to do. You just happened to do better than expected. You gave everything you had and did something that were not ment to be possible. Thats just not fair. <br />
<br />
Chances are: if none of these guilds had beaten the encounter, nothing would have been changed. But because they did, the guilds that will kill after but within this reset will get credit instead. <br />
<br />
I don't see the logic in this. <br />
Why are you punishing the guilds that went in front and accepted the challenge? Leave it be and let the guilds that put in the effort get the credit for it.</div></div><hr />

They have to be gear checks, or they will be all killed in 2-3 weeks as long as they're tuned just short of impossible. You seem to underestimate how much time and effort the top top guilds put into this kind of thing, if there isn't some kind of barrier in place (Sunwells gates/Gear Checks) then even the hardest content they can possibly put out will be killed in less than 2 weeks, likely way less, and people like you will whine about it completely oblivious as to how wide the gulf is between the top 20-30 guilds and the rest.</div></div><hr />

500 sounds rather low. I was testing it yesterday afternoon and I was getting the general 30% damage +10% per disease heal. I don't know if those numbers are exactly correct, but an 8k Death Strike crit (self-buffed without much RP built up) was giving me 2.5k-4k heals. The 500 might have been the actual health you received, without the overheal. Try using Vigilance on yourself first, or jump off a small cliff, then do your Death Strike. The heals should be a bit more full.<br />
<br />
Regardless, 10k+ heals on a now standard spammable attack is overpowered. Mostly PVP-wise.</div></div><hr />

This was in tanking gear and frost spec. When changed to blood dps spec and tanking gear, the difference wasn't terribly large, either. I don't know why, but I've never seen it heal unless you've got a disease on the target, either.<br />
<br />
Generally speaking, this was the Death Knight heal ability, and it feels like there's one missing now... (and no, Rune Tap doesn't count, that's 4 talent points a bit down in the blood tree)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
uhhhhh.... no. How does that make any sense at all? And clearly since it's sooooooo easy, where's your kill shot again?<br />
<br />
The reason he cleared the Hall of Fame isn't because they were &quot;easy&quot; before, it's because the fights have changed and are no longer the same. Blizzard has never &quot;buffed&quot; this many PVE encounters on live servers. The closest thing I can think of was Hydross, but that's because they patched him to be EXTREMELY weak (and added in the 500% multiplier level or w/e), and guilds that raided that Tuesday killed him when they shouldn't have had the coordination to, then they hotfixed his HP that Wednesday, doubling it or so. After that change he was still a lot weaker than before. (FYI I killed him before the super-nerf OR the final &quot;sorta&quot; nerf, *without* camping Nature.)<br />
<br />
Almost all other PVE hotfixes/patch changes have been nerfs in the past.<br />
<br />
If there was a bug where a hard-mode Boss glitched and died at 90% HP, and Blizzard hotfixed it AFTER 2-3 guilds killed it, should those 2-3 guilds get &quot;World First&quot; credit because they did it first, and everyone else is just a sore loser because they didn't kill the bugged boss before it was fixed? And if you say &quot;No,&quot; then we're just arguing semantics. See this:<br />
<br />
Churchill: Madam, would you sleep with me for five million pounds?<br />
Woman: My goodness, Mr. Churchill… Well, I suppose… we would have to discuss terms, of course…<br />
Churchill: Would you sleep with me for five pounds?<br />
Woman: Mr. Churchill, what kind of woman do you think I am?!<br />
Churchill: Madam, we’ve already established that. Now we are haggling about the price.<br />

Your arguiment [sic] couldnt [sic] be any more irrelevant. Its Blizzard who dont [sic] want them to be killed in 2-3 weeks, the players just want fun. <br />
<br />
<br />
And yours couldn't be any more illogical. How the hell will people be sitting around 5 days every reset because normal mode is way easier than hard mode? Did you miss the part where they can work on.... *gasp* hard modes?<br />
<br />
LOL @ expecting to be able to do every hard mode in Naxx gear because you're &quot;so skilled,&quot; btw. Sorry buddy, the bosses have that much HP and hit that hard for a reason. Learn to press your buttons better and you'll get yourself some phat Ulduar purples soon enough.</div></div><hr />

I apologize, I meant Hysteria. Not sure why I confused the two. Also, it doesn't heal without a disease on the target as far as I know.<br />
<br />
But why do you need a healing ability? Especially an overpowered one? Unless you came up with some rotation during this brief window of Death Strike being overpowered, it shouldn't change much if anything in your rotation. If healers are keeping you worried enough that you have to Death Strike to keep yourself alive, switch to a Blood tank spec. Be like other tanks in the meantime and use potions and healthstones.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what makes it less interesting than Obliterate, Scourge Strike, or other high damage, talented attacks. What was really changed that makes it that much worse for you? Obviously as Frost you're not going to be using it; I didn't use Death Strike as Unholy. And untalented it's not going to save you at the right moments before or after this nerf, so I dunno why you're missing it this much.<br />
<br />
And uh, leveling isn't going to change. If you wanted that much self-healing while leveling, you specced Blood in the first place. With 3.1, Blood leveling is more than likely going to be even easier than before. If that's saying anything.<br />
<br />
Tanks don't have to be the same, but they have to do the same thing. Generate threat, reduce incoming damage. Death Strike was only ever a bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However. They MIGHT have went a little overboard in its nerf, Especially as a blood tank i have noticed it now heals less than it did even before the patch.. I was expecting the dmg buff (which for tanking was great - and the added healing from it made it a nice perk to the skill to use - i was under the assumption the healing would be adjusted from it so that it stayed at roughly the lvl it was before the patch.) but when i noticed i was healing for upwards of 10k if i blew out Vamperic blood as a tank i was expecting it to be nerfed. Just not into the ground to the point that it now does nothing atall, 500 or so health from a skill which isnt &quot;that&quot; spammable isnt going to be noticed in PvP much less soften the blow while tanking bosses.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Patchumz</div><div class="date">2009-04-19, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, DS healing nerf was WAY overboard.. with an 8k crit I heal for less than 3k as Blood spec fully self buffed with Mirror of Truth proc'd and stuff... That's a HUGE nerf for all the lucky procs I had to get in order to pull a 2.8k heal... And that's only when it crits, when it doesn't crit it's like a 500 heal.. I'm officially done with Blood spec and have moved to Frost because Blood isn't pulling it's weight anymore.. without healing Blood is nothing. Furthermore I've switched back to my Ele Shaman until Blizzard decides to quit fucking with my Death Knight.. Cuz I just hate being hit so hard every patch and never getting anywhere..<br />
<br />
So, TL;DR: DS hits less than Oblit used to as Blood, and the healing is now NONEXISTENT, ruining the defining feature of being Blood spec. If i'm healing 500-2.5k's at 80 in Naxx10/25 gear then leveling up I'd figure you heal for 50-500.. Blood is dead in my eyes until they revert this and buff the damage. (DRW got nerfed into the fucking ground too, so it's useless as well.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Death strike was not &quot;only ever a bonus&quot; it was an integral part of the class. The option to have a frequent ability that would heal us in substitution for a high-damaging ability was clutch. The problem was it did too much dmg. So instead of nerfing the damage they took away the healing... which makes sense. Because we don't have enough damage-only strikes/abilities. <br />
<br />
As a leveling dk who started out blood and switched to unholy, I used death strike as a main part of my rotation. Because when you're leveling contrary to your belief you need to stay up on HP and to reduce downtime. Not to mention that since BC content is dead, it's impossible to find groups for questing/instancing. I relied very very VERY heavily on DS and would knowingly but frequently sacrifice my scourge strikes/obliterate for more DS because it was imperative to stay alive. Taking out same level elites or 3-5 man group quests are difficult to do as it is (of course possible for the most part) but somewhat difficult. Now it's not as doable. Elites with more than 50k hp I can't really kill now because I don't have enough healing at my disposal to get back the dmg. When incoming dmg hits are 500-1000+ and my DS heals for 250-600 (crit)... i'm a goner. <br />
<br />
Consumables with potions and death pacting, kiting whatever, this massive drop in heals is a killer. It's a killer for tanking and it greatly affects those leveling. I'm speccing blood now just so I can squeeze whatever little bit I can out of the pitiful excuse for death strike we have now.</div></div><hr />

This is rather amusing. Your inability as an inferior leveling spec to solo group quests is greater than the fact that DKs could regularly heal themselves for 10k in the endgame, thus highly increasing their survivability in PvP and to a lesser extent, PvE? I know at least one Priest who is feasting on your tears.<br />
<br />
There's a fun little thing about WoW and leveling. Some specs are better at it than others. Some can't solo group content. This is going to always be the case. Endgame balancing will always trickle down and affect leveling, and it won't always be for the better. There's two easy solutions to this problem. Respec Blood, find a group, or skip the quest. Be glad you even have the first option.</div></div><hr />

Really? Have you raided in this game before WotLK? Not a flame an honest questions. There were a LOT of fights that were gear checks. It's simple you farm what you can in Ulduar until you have the loot neccsary to get over the hump, easy. There have been PLENTY of instances you couldn't finish with just the previous dungeons raiding gear. You could do the begining stuff sure, but trash and bosses later on would beat the piss out of you later on. Patchwerk is a great example of that pre BC or WotLK and at least the most memorable for me.</div></div><hr />
