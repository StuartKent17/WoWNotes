All jokes aside, I hope he's allowed to continue his work without Blizzard doing typical Blizzard things and telling him to stop. These are great quality and really do the story justice.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard have never taken anyone's YouTube content down as far as I know, they are actually very youtube friendly even when people have been critical of their content. They have been very open about people using their content for youtube.<br />
<br />
Otherwise people like Nixxiom, Heel v Babyface, Wowcrendor Nobbel, Jesse Cox, Asmongold, Towliee, Preach, Oxhorn, Myndflame, Nyhm... would have said something. Blizzard have also been kind enough to feature fan created content on their website in the past<br />
<br />
There was (is) a website called Warcraft Movies dedicated to WoW related videos.... So I have no idea where you are getting this 'fun detected' rhetoric from. Either that you you mistook Blizzard for Nintendo.</div></div><hr />

Can't wait for that one, seems to have been delayed by a few days but we should be seeing it tomorrow since he said it would still release before new year's.</div></div><hr />

Human paladins.. Blood Knights used to suck the life out of a Naaru to use their light spells. Frankly, Blood elves should be more savage and ruthless like that. I like my Blood elves stuck up and cold-hearted. They sucked on human potential dick for too long. Time to make them darker again.</div></div><hr />

That's not Blizzard's 'typical' response to fan content at all. The only instance where that actually happened was with that shitty NSFW Yrel movie back in WoD.<br />
<br />
OT: This is pretty great. I love the creative touches he put in (like giving an explanation of how Grommash was captured).<br />
Weird he put a Dranosh cameo in considering he didn't come to Azeroth until WotLK, though.<br />
