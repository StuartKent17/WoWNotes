I know you love them, here is another addon highlight. Today I'll talk about skinner, which is the mod I used on this screenshot for example.  
Basically, skinner changes the layout of all your windows, character frame, inventory, etc, to something ... different (and in my opinion, better).

Clicking the picture will redirect you to wowace.com download page, just browse through the list. But to be honest you should use WowAceUpdater (http://www.wowace.com/wiki/WinAceUpdater), if you never used it before it's gonna change your life. <br />

Won't post too many important things today, there is a lot of work going on the site and I'll probably be able to release a few things soon, tonight or tomorrow if there isn't too much slacking. <br />
<br />
Don't worry, I know that a lot of things are lacking updates, and it will be fixed very soon. ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people have been posting fake versions of it on forums, so make sure you get it directly from the source, been working great for me, author even gives you a FAQ.</div></div><hr />

The only problem I have with it is I receive an error message whenever I open my &quot;Social&quot; window in WoW. It's because I have CTRaid assist and it creates it's own tab in it that isn't being skinned and I get error messages every time I open the window or I switch a tab. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try to copy a CT_RaidAssist.lua file from your \AddOns\Skinner\AddonSkins\ to \AddOns\Skinner\SkinMe\. That should make the trick ;P</div></div><hr />

Is there anything that I should do to ingame to activate it? I tried /ace2 laod skinner, but nothing happened too</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-27, 08:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Missing dependency or something ?</div></div><hr />

this addon depends on what programs?<br />
is there any button for config that should appear?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-27, 02:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In the addon list, check if it's red, or something like that, if it is you can mouseover the name to see which dependency is missing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ique</div><div class="date">2007-06-27, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">not red, yellow as the others that are working...<br />
none of the wowace addons that i downloaded (with wowace updater) are working.<br />
thanks for your attention anyway</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Boubouille</div><div class="date">2007-06-27, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, the best solution is to ask on http://www.wowace.com forums, if you want to do it the easy way (but probably the most stupid too, that's what I do), install all the library available and check if it works. ^^</div></div><hr />
