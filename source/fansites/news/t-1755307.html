Token Price Limits<br />
There are what would more accurately be referred to as fail safes in-place, which are technically &quot;caps&quot;, but are at such extremes they're not intended to be guard bumpers as much to avoid potential errors or issues.<br />
<br />
Well I wouldn't buy a token for money if I wasn't guaranteed a minimum amount of gold when I sell it on the AH. I don't care about a high cap but there needs to be a set floor price.<br />
You are always guaranteed to receive the gold amount quoted to you at the time you place it for sale regardless of the price it actually sells at, whether that's more or less than the current market value.<br />
<br />
This is stated in the newer &quot;New Details&quot; blog:<br />
<br />
As a reminder, to help make sure players can trade WoW Tokens confidently, once a Token sells, the seller will receive the amount of gold they were quoted at the time they listed their Token.<br />
As well as the original announcement and FAQ:<br />
<br />
When you put a WoW Token up for sale, you’ll be quoted the amount of gold you’ll receive once someone buys it—you’re guaranteed to get that amount no matter how the market moves.<br />
<br />
I understand that but I'm asking if market values crashes really hard, is there a hard floor limit? Like treasury bonds that guarantee a minimum return? I know people are speculating some but could the sell price go *that* low?<br />
Like I said there are limits, but they're to catch errors or issues and not as a &quot;We think this is a reasonable minimum/maximum sell value.&quot; But this doesn't really have a lot of variables. It's not like a long winter is going to freeze the orange crops and decimate the market on concentrated frozen orange juice, or anything like that.

On a slow day, sure. Why not. And I think you're underestimating just how difficult mechanics become with half the recommended raid size. The DPS requirement alone is going to be quite tricky, let alone dealing with daggers and bombs and the sheer amount of damage from the adds in phase 2.</div></div><hr />

Well since you are so sure of yourself then you and 4 others try and do it and see how well you go.. The thing is you talk big but can you match that talk with real action.. Being overgeared for a fight maybe but with only 5 people, I know what, since you say you are so good, try and do it with 3 and see how you go and then post here with video proof, and people wont think you a..</div></div><hr />

Actually quite hilarious that there are people who think 5 manning the current raid is very easy and not even worth mentioning. Shows how screwed up this game has become.</div></div><hr />

It's scaled to 10 people. The average dps required for a full 10 man raid, is what.. 20-25k? (avg) So that requires their DPS to pull somewhere 2x that. Full mythic gear, that's a joke to do. This is the same result for the healers. **I looked at a few 'normal' raids with no one padding / carrying the raid, and their avg dps required for the DPS came out to be ~20k.**<br />
<br />
You have to possibly do a few interesting thing for some mechanics, but that's about it. Nothing that gear won't help you completely trivialize.<br />
<br />
I watched the Blast Furnace video, nothing was 'awe-inspiring' that I saw when watching, managed to watch about 3 minutes then just closed it because it was nothing unique, just a bunch of overgeared dudes doing content with 50% of the people. Not gonna bother watching this video.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding most people's comments, with 'mechanics' they have to deal with. The balcony adds die instantly on normal, impales are the same as before, nothing new they have to deal with. Bombs.. Uhh why is that even an argument for the side of 'this is difficult'? Less people, makes it easier.</div></div><hr />

The way I see it, I have more gold than I'll ever spend, so if someone wants to be lazy and pay my monthly sub fee for me, go right ahead.</div></div><hr />

And looks like we found someone who does not think before shooting their mouth off.. I have to laugh at your post, since I am no where near getting Blackhand Normal.. And really dude next time you want to insult someone at least be original with your insult and try to do it with style..<br />
<br />
Actually if people saying in this thread that doing Blackhand Normal with 5 people is supposed to be so easy then why are they not doing it themselves, then they can say they at least have bragging rights that they did it..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lagmoose</div><div class="date">2015-04-10, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still think the token deal is great. It gives me something to spend my gold on and &quot;free&quot; game time to play on, in turn it lets someone have gold who has a hard time getting it because they just can't seem to game the AH like so other many people seem to be able to do, or have time to farm ungodly amount of hours (or maybe they don't have a full list of 100s that can clear all raids for money to pool up). <br />
<br />
I think the &quot;magic price&quot; seems to be around 20-26k. Not too bad. I'm just glad it wasn't something ridiculous like 50-60k, although I wouldn't be surprised to see it get close to that when new content patches arrive.</div></div><hr />

In what world is the person that made actual money in the real world at a real job the lazy one and the person that made fake gold in a video game the hard worker? wtf is wrong with people's brains that they can think this way? :D</div></div><hr />

So much upset over fake money in a game. Who cares how much gold someone else has? Who cares how they obtained that gold in the game (as long as it isn't a result of buying gold from shady people who hack accounts)? I think it's great there is a legit way to basically buy gold. It doesn't make anyone lazy, and as someone who has extremely limited play time, if gives me an option to get gold if I choose to utilize it. Doesn't mean I'm lazy, it just means I would rather spend my time enjoying content than having to farm gold.</div></div><hr />

For me these are great, I'm unemployed and on medical disability so my only income is from the occasional odd job around the neighborhood and my disability benefits. I like the tokens because in the time I do have to play I can easily gather the 20-40k gold I might need to buy the token and will have an extra $15 at the end of the month. It's a win-win.</div></div><hr />
