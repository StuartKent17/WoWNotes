Did you say hi to Gezhe this month ?<br />
Small reminder, that's the beginning of the month and if your consortium reputation is above friendly you should probably go in Nagrand to say hi to your old friend Gezhe. I'm sure he's got a bag full of living rubies waiting for you. <br />

Seriously dude, you need to raid more. Alot of us put our &quot;best looking&quot; gear on for killshots. And Tier3 is surpreme in looks !<br />

There is not as many exalted versions as revered, and it's only a few thousands.<br />
You can't really base a droprate on that. The RNG evens out the difference, resulting in the gem difference being insignifigent.<br />

<br />
So essentially you're the type of person who says something idiotic to the extent of, &quot;That drop rate can't be right because it dropped on the first kill for me!&quot; Those stats aren't player made. It's not like every time something drops a player writes it down and manually submits it. The wowhead client runs in the background, collects all the information, and you click the upload button. Tada. Nothing user created about it. It's far, far more accurate than stats spread out amongst your few characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So what? I got 3 chars exalted with the consortium, and 2 alts not. And before I had 3 chars exalted I got 2 and 1... well you get the idea. And every exalted you get at least 2 blue gems (at least I do.) while lower reps give often no blue gem at all. Revered has a big chance of 1 blue gem yes. But never ever 2 or more for me. Maybe also random but maybe and very logical, that exalted does give better rewards.. instead of being the same as revered.</div></div><hr />

You can't go by that at all. A video has been released and a number of kills to get tid bits about the fight were known by them already. That's a massive advantage.</div></div><hr />

I mean who cares? And its a serious question. Why should i care if some guild in some country downed a boss in Sunwell? Is that a new ? Does it affect wow community in any way? There soooo many servers, with soooo many players in them. Honestly post something that interest all, than puplishing a kill of a guild. Grats for them, i bet they are really cool but it doesnt really consern us!<br />
<br />
<br />
Jealous much?<br />
<br />
It's interesting because it's a boss that's never been killed before. Following the kills are videos of kills, who killed it, what dropped, raid compositions, and acknowledgement of the people who strive to be the best of the best. If that doesn't interest you, so be it, but it seems to interest many, many others.</div></div><hr />

Can you honestly be serious with this comment? First, the boss kill is Kil'jaeden which has been killed maybe a total of 10 times now. This is the first boss kill in a country that has nearly half of the WoW playing population. Secondly, ever hear of warcraftmovies.com? It's a pretty damn popular site with thousands of video views a day of the very thing you're saying is not important to the WoW playing community. Even jealously doesn't produce posts as stupid as yours... I don't know what does.</div></div><hr />

There were rumors cn.wowarmory.com was going online last month, since a link to it appeared in the armory region selector, but it didn't happen.<br />

Here's an image I found on NGA (a popular Chinese WoW forum) though:<br />
