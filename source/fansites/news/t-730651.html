The 24 hour maintenance is to upgrade the realms in the Dallas data centers just like they upgraded the realms in the LA data centers two weeks ago. Those are just preparing for Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

It isn't the server crashing, it's the client. They screwed up royally and introduced a memory leak in 3.3.5 that causes crashes in Crystalsong Forest and Dalaran that are particularly frequent in 64-bit systems.</div></div><hr />

I was thinking the same thing when I saw the message for 24-hour maintenance on my realm. But now I realize that my realm sucks for anything progression related, so I kind of stopped caring. Sucks for the realms that would have had a serious chance for it had the 24-hour maintenance not been this week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This application has encountered a critical error:<br />
<br />
Not enough storage is available to process this command.<br />
<br />
<br />
Cause: From what I've seen, it's related to a 64 bit OS and higher than usual memory usage. I have also read reports of people using Windows 7 32bit getting similar error.<br />
<br />
<br />
The following method has been tested and verified to fix the issues but this is technically against the Blizzard TOS as it requires a 3rd party tool to fix their fuck up.<br />
<br />
If you are not comfortable doing this, simply turn down your graphics - mainly view distance - as that will consume less memory. The out of storage issue arises from hitting the 32-bit application 2 GB address limitation.<br />
<br />
Solution:<br />
http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6510<br />
<br />
Download that file. MAKE A BACKUP OF YOUR WOW.EXE!! Rename it WoW.exe.original; put it elsewhere; JUST BACK IT UP. Once you have the backup made, put a copy of the WoW.exe into the 3GB ENABLER folder. Rename it &quot;Fallout3.exe&quot; and open the &quot;Startme.bat&quot; file. Some stuff will appear on-screen. Press any button to continue. Once you're past that prompt, press the &quot;A&quot; key on your keyboard. This will add the Large Address Aware flag. Rename the EXE back to WoW.exe and put it back in your World of Warcraft folder. If you did this right, the crashes will stop. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
***UPDATE***<br />
Blizz has stated that this is against the terms of use. It is a slight alteration and the risk is minimal; however, THE RISK IS STILL THERE. For reference purposes, I'll leave the thread intact; however, please read Martyt's post before doing anything:<br />

I am betting that RS will go live about like they did with the release of the xpac - at such and such a time, the boats will arrive. So at such and such a time, the sanctum will open, and world first guilds will get plenty of notice so they can compete for it. Seems logical to me, since this is the absolute last boss before the next expansion and nobody was truly on equal footing since Wrath release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they mean that some of the realms will be down for the normal allotted maintenance time, and the ones on the list will be down for 24 hours for extended maintenance. I would take this to mean that there is no opening of Ruby Sanctum this week.<br />
<br />
Also, the list of known issues for 3.3.5 looks suspiciously like a list of bugs and problems that have been happening for quite a long time now, save for a few like the Halion hunter's mark bug. IE, Tyrannis has been remounting Rimefang for quite a while now.</div></div><hr />

Or you can log onto another server somewhere and start a new level 1 alt and probably have it to 80 and decked out in either full Furious or T9 by the time your server comes back online! Outside??

But anyway... yeah What ^^ he says. Make the best of it. We are all going to get hit with it sooner or later.

I was effected by this crashing, sending blizzard about 100 tickets over the period since last patch. I would of sent much less, but I am bored and unemployed atm. Having access to three computers that wow installed on them I fooled around with running my toons back and forth over break points in the game (ZD for hord, and Ember Clutch for alliance). Once I figured out where the breaking point was I started experimenting with the typical Blizzard response such ass add ons, cache files, and so forth. Once I determined it wasn't account or game related I moved on to computer hardware. Currently I narrowed it down to certain types of DDR3 ram either in the video or ECC Ram in the box it's self. Computers with out ECC did not seem to have any problems while ones that do had problems. I was going to start swapping hardware but, mute point pretty sure this mini patch will take care of the issue, I do like to think that the 100 or so crash tickets I sent in with pages of information attached helped speed up the process.<br />

They screwed up royally and introduced a memory leak in 3.3.5 that causes crashes in Crystalsong Forest and Dalaran that are particularly frequent in 64-bit systems.<br />
<br />
It isn't just Crystalsong Forest, its Dalaran, and any where Dalaran phases out. For example, I would get a critical error if I flew to ICC or if I flew in the direction of Ulduar. Dalaran is just really screwed up right now with 64bit systems. I was getting the same critical error everyone is getting since 3.3.5, but before 3.3.5 and less often. So, its been a problem for a while, just not as bad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2010-06-29, 06:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey guys, remember like 3 weeks ago when all the LA Data Center servers were down for 24 hour maintenance? And you were all like &quot;haha, my server isn't going down!&quot; and we said &quot;It will, they're just going data center by data center&quot;? You remember that? No, of course you don't, because these forum have the collective memory of a may-fly. They're doing hardware upgrades on every server cluster in preparation for Cataclysm. If you want Cataclysm, get over yourselves, accept that computers occasionally require maintenance and upgrades, and live with having to spend a day doing something else. <br />
<br />
I swear, you'd think that people have nothing else to do. Once, just once, every expansion they shut down every server for 24 hours to make sure they're all up to snuff for the next expansion. Perhaps you know some magical way to upgrade all the hardware, software and operating systems on a computer without taking it offline. If so, we very definitely have a business opportunity available to us. Please message me so we can both become rich.</div></div><hr />

Either you misunderstood your friends or they are wrong. The 3.3.5 patch was installed last week on all US realms and it included the Ruby Sanctum raid. It is just not active yet and will be as simple as flipping a switch to activate it as someone said earlier in the thread. The extended maintenance that is happening in the Dallas data centers is exactly what happened in LA a few weeks ago. They have yet to touch the servers in Boston or Seattle yet. Those 24 hour outages are simply to upgrade the hardware on the realms in preparation for Cataclysm just like Blizzard said.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard never said Ruby Sanctum was coming this week. Try and find a post, you won't. Just because the RealID system seemed successful to us doesn't mean there wasn't problems on the backend such as Oh a memory leak. So like Blizzard said, it will be tested on the US realms until it's ready. Then 3.3.5 will be patched into the rest of the world and if we're lucky it might even go live that week. But I would assume they will wait till the following week.<br />
<br />
24 maintenance is to update the servers/databases in preparation for Cataclysm. If you played vanilla wow you'd recall they did this prior to TBC and WOTLK. There's no better time than during the summer when people are outside enjoying themselves. Wait, what am I thinking this is Wow!</div></div><hr />

COMPLETELY and utterly agree! I have NOT gotten the ice chip upon my main yet.

Due to the fact that we will be delaying the release of patch 3.3.5 in Europe, Korea and Taiwan in order to ensure the patch process in all regions is as smooth as possible, the Ruby Sanctum will not immediately be available on North American realms upon the release of the patch. Once patch 3.3.5 has been released in North America and we are confident about a time when we can open up Ruby Sanctum, we will provide an update here on the forums.(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25171669763/patch-3-3-5-ruby-sanctum-availability))<br />

And I've done the boss every single day on six alts, and only seen one pet so far across all of them. I've seen the enchant multiple times.<br />
<br />
The point is: anecdotal experience doesn't mean anything. Random is random. You could get it ten times in a row, or never in a thousand times. Neither of those experiences are necessarily indicative of the actual drop rate.</div></div><hr />

One should complain about a bugged patch yes, but they shouldn't complaina bout repeated crashes in dalaran if they didn't at least use known work arounds.<br />

Your reason is busted, Arygos hasnt been down for 24 hours yet and we have ruby sanctum...and 24 hours for ruby sanctum...really?<br />
Its preparing the systems for cata.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rayebs</div><div class="date">2010-06-30, 06:28 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And I've done the boss every single day on six alts, and only seen one pet so far across all of them. I've seen the enchant multiple times.<br />
<br />
The point is: anecdotal experience doesn't mean anything. Random is random. You could get it ten times in a row, or never in a thousand times. Neither of those experiences are necessarily indicative of the actual drop rate.<br />
<br />
Whatever the drop rate may be, it is Irritating that one of the limited opportunities to attempt to acquire this mini pet is taken away. I can live with 24 hours not on my server... I am displeased with losing a chance at something i greatly desire and that no amount of EFFORT will i gain it.</div></div><hr />
