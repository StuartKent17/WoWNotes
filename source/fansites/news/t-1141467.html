Character Inspection Changes<br />
This build brought two small changes to inspecting other characters. When you inspect someone, you are able to see their specialization, talents, and glyphs. <br />
<br />
You may now inspect anyone as long as you can target them, including targeting them through being in the same group, no matter where they are. This even works in cross realm groups! The only thing that doesn't show when the other player is not visible to you is their 3D model.<br />
<br />

Female Pandaren Emote Voice<br />
The latest patch brought us some new Female Pandaren emote voices. The animations in the video are not complete and are not intended to be in perfect sync with the video. <br />

A Brewing Storm Scenario<br />
Today we have a preview of one of the shorter scenarios that have been released so far, A Brewing Storm. Keep in mind this is still an early preview and everything is subject to change. <br />
<br />

Level 90 Rewards<br />
As previously mentioned, this build opens level 90 to players. Upon reaching level 90, Lorewalker Cho sends you a nice mail with a free purple firework and points you towards breadcrumb quests. <br />
<br />
These breadcrumb quests are found on the lower outdoor tier of your faction's city in Pandaria and point you to all of the daily quest areas. Unfortunately many of the lines are not available to players yet, including the Cloud Serpents and Tillers farming area.<br />

Nothing from the CMs about WoW recently, so we have a post from the Diablo side on the speed at which Blizzard makes changes.<br />
Rapid Game Changes<br />
There's a time and a place for fast-action, high-priority designations. And believe me, we do have those types of approval pipelines. I'd argue though that reacting in a rash manner does not, in most cases, make for great game design.<br />
<br />
Game design really is an art form more than a mathematical equation, even with so much math involved. The end goal should be amazing gameplay. And how that's defined will differ from person to person.<br />
<br />
Sure, we can be slow to act. Sometimes we can be too slow. But even with the mistakes we've made -- and the mistakes we're sure to make in the future -- I think we're better off taking a measured approach to potential design changes. <br />
<br />
If you know you're slow to react and implement changes, can't you be a little more forthcoming with informing us of what you want to do?<br />
We're always striving to improve our communication. The primary function of the community team is to listen to the players, so we've spent a lot of time these past few weeks compiling feedback and taking it to the developers.<br />
<br />
The flip side of that coin is for us to relay information back to the community as best as we can and as often as possible.<br />
<br />
Does your team simply hate talking with the public for fear of &quot;breaking promises&quot;?<br />
No, but you're asking very specific questions about late-game class balance only a couple of weeks into Diablo III's life cycle. The overwhelming majority of the community isn't even there yet. We're watching things very closely and have a lot of tweaks in mind, many of which are already being worked out, but we're not looking to jump all over balance adjustments and catch players off-guard. And it's certainly not an MMO where balance is among the biggest concerns.<br />
<br />
For those who have already invested a lot of time into this game I'm sure these last couple of weeks have felt like a lifetime. But with regard to this game's lifespan, we're barely in our infancy.<br />
<br />
All of that said, we're already preparing another game design update to share with everyone soon. We hope that'll provide additional insight into our plans for the foreseeable future.

Oh man, don't we love guys like you? So Blizzard allows players on beta now to ding 90. They also enable scenarios to be tested. What is the point of making those scenarios then so hard IN BETA that all the freshly dinged lv 90s die? <br />

Agreed. By itself, it's a nice, quality voice, but it just doesn't fit the model or its very animated, emotive...uh...emotes. Had the same general feeling with the male voiceovers too, but nowhere as bad as this... :/<br />
<br />

<br />
As I understand it, it's supposed to be something like group quests. The problem with group quests was, that it was hard to find groups sometimes, so most people basically skipped them most of the time. With scenarios it should be easier to find people for it, as you can probably search cross-server. It's a tool for telling a story, especially in places, that have some kind of meaning in the game, like Alcaz Island used to be Varian's prison.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Scenarios look like what they are meant to be, group quests. This is a small scenario, wait for the rest to come out before you can QQ.</div></div><hr />

good call on the Caribbean. I was trying to figure out what it was, was thinking maybe African. Agree with the poster who said she sounds like an old woman, also.<br />

<br />
omfg - gotta love responses like this - not every one who thinks pokemon games and scenarios with ZERO challenge are bogus is an elitist <br />
<br />
Zero level of difficulty / challenge / chance to die means the scenarios have little or no replay value and are basically a waste of development resources. They also do nothing to teach people how to play better beyond standing in green healing circles so have little value in that regard as well. <br />
<br />
The problem with creating content with ZERO challenge is that it has a ripple effect throughout the game by constantly lowering the lowest common denominator bar which changes the difficulty curve of other aspects of the game. It also leads to the burning through of content at an ever faster rate that leads to player boredom etc. And Dragon Soul and LFR are the best example of that.<br />
<br />
The funny thing that most people miss about Mists is how Blizzard has cleverly deluded most by creating more and more grind-fests (pokeman, dailies up the yazoo etc) that require little or no effort or skill but lots of time. In fact, to stay competitive, you will actually probably have to invest more time into each of your characters as a result. <br />
<br />
Personally, I would prefer that some aspects of the game beyond Heroic raiding presented some form of meaningful challenge. And I would prefer well thought out and creative content, even if there was less of it, then having everything but the kitchen sink thrown into the game regardless of it's quality, lore consistency and complete lack of challenge...but hey that's just me.</div></div><hr />

yeah, this is exactly what I thought. With the dance and the hairstyles it's obvious Blizzard wanted to give the impression of a young person, I don't get why the voice sounds like this. I mean, when I don't look at the video, I can see an old woman speaking the lines.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">det</div><div class="date">2012-06-04, 07:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">omfg - gotta love responses like this - not every one who thinks pokemon games and scenarios with ZERO challenge are bogus is an elitist <br />
<br />
Zero level of difficulty / challenge / chance to die means the scenarios have little or no replay value and are basically a waste of development resources. They also do nothing to teach people how to play better beyond standing in green healing circles so have little value in that regard as well. <br />
<br />
The problem with creating content with ZERO challenge is that it has a ripple effect throughout the game by constantly lowering the lowest common denominator bar which changes the difficulty curve of other aspects of the game. It also leads to the burning through of content at an ever faster rate that leads to player boredom etc. And Dragon Soul and LFR are the best example of that.<br />
<br />
The funny thing that most people miss about Mists is how Blizzard has cleverly deluded most by creating more and more grind-fests (pokeman, dailies up the yazoo etc) that require little or no effort or skill but lots of time. In fact, to stay competitive, you will actually probably have to invest more time into each of your characters as a result. <br />
<br />
Personally, I would prefer that some aspects of the game beyond Heroic raiding presented some form of meaningful challenge. And I would prefer well thought out and creative content, even if there was less of it, then having everything but the kitchen sink thrown into the game regardless of it's quality, lore consistency and complete lack of challenge...but hey that's just me.<br />
<br />
Give me a break here. You didn't even read the part where this is beta and it might change? But I indulge you. So...&quot;Zero level of difficulty / challenge / chance to die means (something has) little or no replay value and are basically a waste of development resources. &quot; Oh...that sounds like QUESTING in WoW. Wasted resources. Wait..that also sounds like 5 man normals? Wasted resources. LFR: No challenge, no chance to die. Wasted resources. I bet you agree on that but TWO million players in LFR will beg to differ. <br />
<br />
The ripple effect? What are you? A game designer - no you are NOT. Blizzard decides to put all kinds of opportunites into the game so people CAN CHOSE what to play. I am glad you mentioned DS and this is why your post can just be discarded unless you are in a world first HM 8/8 group. Don't even drop LFR and DS into one pot. It is a spread out difficulty (now even with a zone buff) that goes from &quot;faceroll with strangers&quot; to &quot;Hello, we are wiping every day for two weeks&quot;. In fact - there are people even now who still ask for help in HMs. 4/8, 6/8. It does seem indeed that this aspect of the game IS still a challenge. Would you deprive people of that experience, set only one difficulty that only less than 1000 players can beat and call it a day? That has been done. That ship sailed. That system failed. You do not make games that exclude customers. Or - if you do be prepared for them to fail.<br />
<br />
It is nice that you prefer some aspects of the game beyond heroic raiding to be a challenge. But what were EVER a challenge and not a grindfest? Maybe the epic hunter and priest quests? Thanks, I am a Paladin. But relax - in case you missed it, you get challenge modes.<br />
<br />
And ofc you always have the option to play games like EVEonline if you despise the way that WoW goes.</div></div><hr />

While I agree the voice sounds too old for the portrayal, Panadarians seem like the class designed for fatties. Previous races; Taurens excepted mostly; have been very fit and firm... now we have the flabbies... perfect for far too many players. FWIW, a few of the emotes sounded very, uh, bordering on racial stereotypes.... especially the &quot;Your are so skilled&quot;.

<br />
I agree with your full post. (Just didn't wanna quote the whole thing). I happen to know a few good uses for scenarios as well, even though they may not provide a challenge in terms of difficulty. I have a few people in my guild who are actually new to WoW. They are trying out different specs and rotations at the moment to see which ones they like the best. Scenarios would actually be a wonderful place for them to test out some of these. Only because if they aren't pulling the biggest numbers no one is going to give those players too hard of a time. Target dummies are nice, but they are not accurate when it comes to the actual damage you do in most cases. Only because target dummies don't lose life so you can't use finishing moves, or moves that get increased damage at 30% or lower life, etc. So Scenarios are a great way for newer members to get a feel on how their character plays at max level, and it will help them improve.<br />
<br />
Everything in this game serves a purpose. Anyone who thinks, &quot;Well this is too easy, there's no challenge, it's stupid and a waste of space&quot;, I suggest those people do what is considered harder, like normal raids or HM raids...or rated battlegrounds, arenas, etc. No one is required to participate in every aspect of the game. Everyone can choose what they want to do and what they don't want to do. But just because it's not something that appeals to one person doesn't mean it's gonna be the same way with every person. I personally am looking forward to playing through scenarios simply for the lore aspect. Plus I love questing. But sadly I've done all my loremaster stuff. So scenarios are gonna be kinda like one big quest, so it does appeal to me. And since they seem to be more interactive than dailies I think I will enjoy them a little more.</div></div><hr />

The Draenei similarity doesn't bug me, but the voice seems a bit too old for the look, like hearing a 50-year-old voice come out of a 30-year-old mouth. Not saying they should all sound like teenagers, mind you, but it is just a little too deep for such a youthful-looking face.</div></div><hr />

I do agree though that the voice is not fitting for the animations that have a lot of energy to them, voice is very calm, movement is spasmic :D I like both separately, but I don't know if they work together.</div></div><hr />

I'm not wishing for a squealing girl's voice either. It doesn't change my opinion, though, that the voice and animations don't go together.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, a monk strives for inner balance and harmony between body and spirit, that should be reflected in their voice as well. I would have preffered them having a slightly deeper, a little lighter than a tauren female voice, as the current voice-over does not seem to fit with their fairly well rounded bodies.<br />

I like most of their lines. But I still die a little inside each time I see a female pandaren burst into the caramelldansen, for they had the chance to show us one of hundreds of beautiful traditional Chinese dances. But I guess some do get a chuckle out of it, so all's well..</div></div><hr />
