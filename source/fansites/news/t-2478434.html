Rise of Azshara PTR - Initial Class Changes<br />
Rise of Azshara PTR - Initial Class Changes<br />
We’ve been working on a suite of targeted changes that focus on improving gameplay for several specs. You’re going to see changes that are close to the following in the first build of the Rise of Azshara PTR (coming next week).<br />
<br />
https://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idemonhunters.gif Demon Hunter (Forums (https://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/358-Demon-Hunter) / Skills (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/?filter-class=12) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
<br />
Vengeance<br />
<br />
Demonic Wards (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/203513-demonic-wards): damage reduction increased to 15% (was 10%).<br />
Demonic Wards (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/203513-demonic-wards): armor bonus increased to 100% (was 80%).<br />
Demon Spikes (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/203720-demon-spikes): armor reduced to 60% of Agility (was 85%).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: More than other tanks, Vengeance is currently dealing with the problem of low mitigation when their active mitigation is down. These changes are a substantial increase to physical mitigation when Demon Spikes is down, and a neutral-to-very-slight increase when Demon Spikes is active. There is also some overall passive reduction to magic damage. Overall, Vengeance’s sustained damage taken will be lower, and the periods of vulnerability outside of Demon Spikes should be less dramatic.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
https://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (https://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
<br />
Soothe (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/2908-soothe), Remove Corruption (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/2782-remove-corruption), Moonfire (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/164812-moonfire), and Rebirth (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/20484-rebirth) are no longer castable in Cat or Bear form by default.<br />
<br />
Feral Druids now have a visible passive learned at level 22 that allows Remove Corruption (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/2782-remove-corruption) and Soothe (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/2908-soothe) to be cast in Cat Form.<br />
<br />
Guardian Druids now have a visible passive learned at level 10 that allows Soothe (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/2908-soothe), Remove Corruption (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/2782-remove-corruption), Moonfire (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/164812-moonfire), and Rebirth (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/20484-rebirth) to be cast in Bear Form.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: Guardian Druid is limited in its practical ability to use some utility abilities while tanking, and we’re loosening that restriction by allowing Remove Corruption in Bear Form. We’re also cleaning up Druid shapeshifting rules slightly: the use of magical-themed spells, in Feral forms, is allowed by passive upgrades given to Guardian and Feral specializations specifically. This represents their special mastery of their “home” form that allows for limited spellcasting, and from a gameplay perspective, this allows Feral/Guardian Druids to use spells in form where there is a strong practical need. At the same time, there are situations where there is no fantasy justification or gameplay need, and spellcasting might be more restricted. For example, non-Guardian Druids can no longer cast Moonfire in Bear Form.<br />
<br />
<br />
Guardian<br />
<br />
Ironfur (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/192081-ironfur) and Maul (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/6807-maul) now cost 40 Rage (was 45).<br />
Mangle (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/33917-mangle) now generates 10 Rage (was 8).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: Ironfur is intended to be maintainable with high uptime, up to 100%, and have some overlaps on top of that. Currently, depending on talent configuration, Druids may only be able to barely maintain full uptime on Ironfur. Making Ironfurs much more available should allow better control over timing and overlaps, as well as improving Guardian mitigation overall.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shifting to Bear Form now gives 25 Rage (was 20).<br />
<br />
Developer’s notes: It should now be much easier to get the first Ironfur activated promptly after engaging an enemy, due to the increased starting Rage and lower cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mangle (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/33917-mangle) and Thrash (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/106832-thrash) direct damage increased by 15%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Beast Mastery<br />
<br />
Barbed Shot (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/217200-barbed-shot) damage is now affected by Bestial Wrath (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/19574-bestial-wrath).<br />
Barbed Shot (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/217200-barbed-shot) damage reduced by 10%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: We are fixing a bug that caused Bestial Wrath to not affect Barbed Shot damage, and lowering the base damage of Barbed Shot to keep overall damage roughly unchanged.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
https://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (https://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
<br />
Outlaw<br />
<br />
Keep Your Wits About You (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/288979-keep-your-wits-about-you)(Azerite Trait) now stacks once per instance of Blade Flurry (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/13877-blade-flurry) dealing damage (was once for every target Blade Flurry hits). Each stack now provides 5% Sinister Strik (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/1752-sinister-strike)e chance (was 2%).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: In very large packs of enemies, especially in dungeons, Keep Your Wits About You provides much more damage than one copy of one Azerite Trait was intended to provide. With this change, you’ll still feel this trait accelerate as you build stacks, but the size of the group that you’re fighting won’t affect how much damage the trait is giving you. This will be a damage increase against two targets, and a damage reduction against 3 or more targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Protection<br />
<br />
Unstoppable Force Thunderclap (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/275336-unstoppable-force) damage reduced to 50% (was 100%).<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: Protection Warrior burst DPS with Avatar is extremely high for a tank. This talent was adding more damage than necessary, given that it also decreases Thunder Clap’s cooldown and synergizes well with certain Azerite traits.<br />
<br />
<br />

We’ll update this post as necessary, especially as we develop PvP-specific tuning adjustments over the first few weeks of the PTR.</div></div><hr />

Not killed, just a tad less effective and broken OP.<br />
<br />
Rogues even with 0 dps will always be welcome in m+ due to their native allities.<br />
Go cry somewhere else that you won't be broken OP anymore.</div></div><hr />

The important part is bolded, these are basically just to quiet the MDI outrage that is going on right now. Of course they're not the only changes coming in 8.2, so don't worry that class X didn't get buffed or class Y didn't get nerfed. Expect Warlocks, SPriests and maybe Moonkin to eat some raid related nerfs as well which should bring everything closer together<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, for the sake of fairness, they can't make too many changes mid tournament, so this is the best we get.</div></div><hr />

this is the INITIAL class changes. im sure there will be plenty more, AND probably for all classes some way or another.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I want to believe that. But I thought the same thing for 8.0.5 and for 8.1 and for 8.1.5. Nothing happened. Small adjustments here and there, but the class imbalance is still enormous and specs are still dull to play.<br />
<br />
We aren't just a step down from Legion, we are barely few steps up from Classic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
closer together ? Shadow Priest and Aff/destro locks are Specs that should always be on top of the meters when an encounter allows for spread damage. which happens alot in BoD<br />
<br />
on pure ST they get beaten by like 9-10 other specs<br />
<br />
I think they are in a great Spot right now</div></div><hr />

Specs dominating in their respective niches comes as no surprise. BoD having cleaving encounters means sp/locks/boomies dominate on the meters and I don't see it changing. Rogues, DH and DK obliterate M+ trash packs and that's by design.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, lower their damage, give them nothing else and remove the only thing that sets them apart from other tanks.<br />
<br />
Please make the inferior versions of every other tank spec out there again. A truly brilliant move by the dev team that once again proves it has no clue how the game work.<br />
<br />
As Ion said before Necrotic was changed to physical damage: &quot;Take Necrotic, for example, its presence makes a Prot Warrior better and a Blood DK worse.&quot; Yes, that was truly stupid and completely out of touch and removed from how the game actually worked.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">captaincoffeecup</div><div class="date">2019-04-13, 02:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Prot Warrior is currently ridiculous for AoE damage. My 355 newly levelled Warrior does 24k on some packs in dungeons, where as my 408 Brewmaster does about 21k. This is a necessary change but it doesn't break the spec so I'm fine with it. Warrior is in a good place right now but it's damage is just stupid high and definitely needs a nerf to AoE.<br />
<br />
To the poster who said Rogues and Demon Hunters got buffed, that's just wrong. It's a nerf to one Rogue spec that will probably be negligible, but certainly not a buff outside of 2 target cleave (which is pretty rare in m+). As for Demon Hunters, this is for Vengeance, not Havoc. Vengeance is an insanely weak tank right now, far worse than anything else. They have one button mitigation that is OK with Demon Spikes, but outside of that, DH tanks are really, really bad for damage mitigation. It wouldn't be so bad if that just affected m+ where you can kite a lot, but in raids the spec is just unplayable right now. This buff to the tank spec is very welcome and completely necessary. I would say it isn't enough in fact.</div></div><hr />

Prot is garbage without thunderclap dmg and its mitigation sucks? Please, tell me more.<br />
<br />
Prot is pretty meh in M+ when you remove the high damage factor.<br />
<br />
They were meh at the start of the expansion and now they'll be meh again. Not unviable, just meh.<br />
<br />
Prot desperately needs some utility brought back. If prot warrior doing high damage isn't a factor, why bring a prot warrior over other tanks with ranged silences, better group utility, death grips, knockbacks and all the rest?<br />
<br />
There's a stun and a weak fear and that's about it. Used to be you could point to the mobility at least, but others do that better now too.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nevertheless prot warriors did too much damage. Nerf is justified.<br />
<br />
Agreed. Absolutely needed the damage nerf. Just a bit sad to see Rogue and other class adjustments were &quot;Ok we wanna nerf the OP part without totally damaging other parts&quot; but Prot warrior note is simply &quot;Yeah. Straight nerf. Sorry!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
At least we know you're totally clueless about tanking and talking with your ass.<br />
<br />
Thanks for sparing us the time of a pointless discussion.<br />

Don't know what's so wrong about letting tanks do dmg... just buff all the tanks up to warrior level.<br />
<br />
Probably a bit extreme, as Prot was out damaging many other actual DPS in equal gear, on the AOE at least. I think there's room for tanks to do damage without making them better than half the actual DPS specs at it.</div></div><hr />

I think the damage nerf is 100% fair provided we get a couple of small defensive/utility buffs to compensate. Spell Reflect needs to be made to last longer (like 8-10 seconds), and not just have itself consumed IMMEDIATELY when a deflectable spell comes our way. Ignore Pain, especially when you are being bombarded and are barely scrapping up the Rage to cast it is WOEFULLY inadequate mitigation to handle heavy magic damage intake, especially in raids (Jadefire Master fire birdo will rip your asshole apart).<br />
<br />
Ever since they nerfed the absorb cap on it, it's hardly the case that you are ever able to put up an absord shield worth a shit. Not to mention our damage will now put us in league with high-performing Prot Pallies (they will overtake us on cleave fights now I'm sure), except they have the same block capacity we do ON TOP of % mitigation that also works on magic and vastly dwarfs ours.</div></div><hr />

Barbed Shot damage is now affected by Bestial Wrath.<br />
Barbed Shot damage reduced by 10%.<br />
Developers’ notes: We are fixing a bug that caused Bestial Wrath to not affect Barbed Shot damage, and lowering the base damage of Barbed Shot to keep overall damage roughly unchanged.&quot;<br />
<br />
In other words - we nerfed Barbed Shot to underperform for 75 seconds of the 90 second cooldown to compensate for the 15 seconds of enhanced performance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please make the inferior versions of every other tank spec out there again. A truly brilliant move by the dev team that once again proves it has no clue how the game work.<br />
<br />
As Ion said before Necrotic was changed to physical damage: &quot;Take Necrotic, for example, its presence makes a Prot Warrior better and a Blood DK worse.&quot; Yes, that was truly stupid and completely out of touch and removed from how the game actually worked.<br />

It's the other 2 talents that are absolute garbage.<br />
<br />
I don't think the point is to make us take the other talents, but more to ensure that Thunder Clap alone doesn't do more damage than every single tank in the game is capable of outputting with their entire toolkit. As a Warrior main, there's no reason our tank spec should be competing with most DPS specs on damage in M+. <br />
<br />
As for the other changes, Rogues will still be M+ kings even if they outright removed that trait, and Vengeance might need even more than the current buffs, the spec just isn't great at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vengeance was pretty trash (compared to most other tanks) in m+ at key levels that matter. They have been for a while. They didn't buff demon hunters, they buffed vengeance spec (havoc is unchanged as of yet).<br />
<br />
And if you read the notes, it was a straight up nerf (and a pretty big one) to outlaw rogues in aoe situations, and an almost unnoticeable buff to their st and 2t cleave. Overall, outlaw got nerfed in m+, which is what these changes were aimed at.<br />
<br />
But i suppose if your warlock isn't brokenly overpowered anymore, it needs to be buffed before any other changes are made.</div></div><hr />

Unblockable magic damage and bleeds? No ranged interrupt/silence capability? Basically no self-healing ability? No hard CC to offer, no silences, no healing for your group, no group-based utility, no knockbacks or grips, etc<br />
<br />
Prot has great physical mitigation and the high DPS, but other tanks do most everything else in m+ better. Nerfing prot damage just means we go back to how it was before, with everyone taking the DKs I guess.<br />
<br />
There's a reason people didn't take Prot to high level m+ (and Challenge Modes before that). Prot dominating M+ is a recent thing after people realised how much damage they do... not because they're so amazing for m+ performance in any other tangible way.</div></div><hr />

Lol what? They can easily interrupt range due to charge, single and aoe frontal stun, aoe fear, Ignore Pain is amazing absorb because why heal if you can just not take the damage. Magic Reduction and reflection with Spell Reflection, group attack power buff, Rally cry which gives 15% max hp increase, Immunity to fear, sap, and incapacitate effects, fantastic mobility, I can go on and on. You obviously dont know anything about warrior tanking. Any top M+ tank will tell that dmg wasn't the only thing but more on the dmg reduction they have vs other tanks.<br />

Every tank has bleed isssues, no tanks are great at magic mitigation. Half the tanks don't have ranged interrupts, no self healing is trade off for THE BEST physical mitigation, has AOE fear, has spell reflect which is huge, has intercept..etc etc..90% of dungeons are all about physical mitigation so, half your points are fluff anyway. Get on with the game, prot needed a nerf, in fact it needs a physical mitigation nerf on top of dmg nerf to be frank.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't that long ago we saw the entire M+ scene dominated by a particular tank class because they brought so much to the table, and everyone whined about them. I promise you in a couple of months we'll be back in that position again because nothing has changed on that front.<br />
<br />
All I'm saying is if they're going to nerf the damage (which is needed) they should bring tank utility for these dungeons more in line... because unless your memory only extends back a few months, it was not long ago that everyone was crying prot warriors were useless on that front. And I get in response a bunch of crazy people telling me Prot Warriors are still going to be the best dungeon tank because they &quot;have no weaknesses&quot; and &quot;need even more nerfs&quot;<br />

Ya because when your argument is flawed, you resort to &quot;OH MY GOD A DIFFERENT TANK WAS DOMINATING META LAST YEAR SO WE MUST DOMINATE IT NOW&quot;, thats not how balance works.

Blizzard is known for half-assing everything so I wouldnt be surprised if these were all the changes and then &quot;just wait for essences and it will be ok&quot;. I dont mind, I play fotm class anyway so its fine, but im pretty sure a lot of people arent really enjoying their classes and blizzards policy of barely making changes once every 3 months doesnt help.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not trying to argue anything of the sort. Perhaps you've misunderstood the entire posts. This is what I mean by it feels like Crazy pills. Because I post something and I get a response like this which is absolutely not related to what I said at all. I didn't say shit about prot warrior not being OP right now.<br />
<br />
I don't think Prot Warrior should dominate any shit. I don't think that it's okay for anyone to dominate anything. I don't think that the DPS of prot warrior was fine. I think it needed nerfed, I totally agreed like 4 times that the nerf was expected.<br />
<br />
My point was that other classes dominated before because of what they offer. Prot Warrior took the lead due, largely, to the insanely ridiculous amount of DPS offered. That had to be fixed. It's GOOD that it was fixed. No tank should do that much damage. (Frankly I think tanks should do almost no damage because having to balance tank DPS has been a fuckfest since the beginning, but whatever, that's a different argument.)<br />
<br />
However, now that the damage is getting nerfed, we just simply flip back to the way things were before. I don't think that's okay either. Unlike half the people in this topic, I played Prot Warrior when people considered us garbo before we were M+ fotm and I don't believe enough has changed in that department. No, I don't think &quot;charging and using pummel on mobs&quot; is remotely comparable to all of the mob control granted by Death Grips, ranged silences, knockbacks etc you can gain by taking other classes... and neither did anyone else a few months ago before you all got hypnotised by FOTM jerkoff circles and seemingly forgot everything people were complaining about some months ago, and will no doubt start complaining about again once the &quot;GRR I HATE PROT WARRIORS AND THEIR OP DPS&quot; rage subsides.<br />
<br />
Lets sum up:<br />
Removing the OP DPS from Prot Warrior = Good. Not compensating that by adjusting the tank utility balance for 5-mans = Bad. Is that succinct enough? :confused:<br />
<br />
Not even asking for much. Just restoring some shit they pruned like gag order on heroic throws (with an internal cooldown), or taunt banner or something would be a huge change...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because your verbal diarrhea about prot warrior not being currenty stupidly OP just sounds retarded.<br />

This is at no point what I said. Prot warrior damage was definitely OP. Standard &quot;I didn't read what you said but I've got my own agenda I'm trying to push hard so I'm just going to pretend what you said is whatever I want&quot; :rolleyes:<br />

Yes that is a good point, about things going back to how they were (different class dominating the scene). I think certain unique abilities must be changed, mass grips, shrouds, and battle resses to certain extend are all problematic as long as they are unique/somewhat rare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly! Although, I think unique abilities/rare abilities like death grip are okay, in that without unique stuff we end up in a homogenisation situation where no classes bring anything cool over other classes, and I know people don't want that.<br />
<br />
But there should be more of a trade off when it comes to unique utility, especially among tanks and healers because you only get one of them in the group. One tank shouldn't be the go-to for every dungeon, either because they bring 50% more DPS than other tanks or because they blow the others out of the water on utility/control.<br />

DPS it's less of a big deal because there's room to fit 1 utility guy and 1 high DPS guy in your set of 3... although I do think MAJOR abilities like mass grip and shroud should get a similar system for 5-mans as CRs or Bloodlust got... some kind of global group cooldown so there's no incentive to stack multiple classes for it. Not sure how people would feel about that.</div></div><hr />

Unfortunately, for the sake of fairness, they can't make too many changes mid tournament, so this is the best we get.<br />
<br />
What do you mean with this? This changes are coming in like 2-4 months with 8.2... <br />
<br />
Tbh I'm not sure how I feel about prot warrior nerf to AoE damage, like with Reaping gone which is when this changes come into place the difference in damage from Warriors to Prot Paladins isn't that huge anymore but on the other hand other tanks bring more ''utility'' kind of spells to the group. So, I honestly think with a new season Prot warriors will simply die off - especially if they actually bring a more single target seasonal affix.<br />

As a Warrior, anyone who thought Prot's damage was fine and no nerf was coming is delusional.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see you only see Warriors from the outside without their bad points.<br />
<br />
No self-healing.<br />
<br />
Only Blood DKs have less mobility.<br />
<br />
Breaks if they have no Rage to use Shield Block or IP.<br />
<br />
As a Prot, I have to do a lot more work for tanking than I have to do on my Monk, DK or DH.<br />
<br />
So yeah, lower their damage in which case they'll have the lowest self-healing, second lowest mobility, and some of the worst baseline survivability of all the tank specs in the game, aka. useless unless there are no other tanks in the LFG.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has said that the niche of the Prot Warrior is to be the DPS tank, now that's being lowered. Tell me what left when the niche has been filled out with bricks?</div></div><hr />

Guy did you realy just claim Prot Warriors lack mobility?? You do know of Heroic Leap and Charge, right? You do know you can use Charge on friendly targets as well, right? Healing is low, but survivability is not.</div></div><hr />

Yes, lower their damage, give them nothing else and remove the only thing that sets them apart from other tanks.<br />
<br />
Please make the inferior versions of every other tank spec out there again. A truly brilliant move by the dev team that once again proves it has no clue how the game work.<br />
<br />
As Ion said before Necrotic was changed to physical damage: &quot;Take Necrotic, for example, its presence makes a Prot Warrior better and a Blood DK worse.&quot; Yes, that was truly stupid and completely out of touch and removed from how the game actually worked.<br />

If you think I'm wrong then explain what you think is wrong instead of pulling this vague, condescending crap. Do you have the mental maturity of a middle schooler? Because things like these were only popular in middle school.<br />

Guy did you realy just claim Prot Warriors lack mobility?? You do know of Heroic Leap and Charge, right? You do know you can use Charge on friendly targets as well, right? Healing is low, but survivability is not.<br />
<br />
It's called Intervene and Intervene requires a target and HL is on a 45 sec CD and only has one Charge and can never be improved, less if talented, there are better talents on that row, Roll and Demonic Leap (Charge)? has 2 and no target requirement.<br />
<br />
Needing a target is bad because if the target is in the wrong location you end up in the wrong location as well. That leaves HL. The only thing that comes close in functionality is the horse of paladins, full disclosure, last I played a paladin was in Legion and back then Prot Paladins could get two charges on it.<br />
<br />
That leaves Bears, which iirc have access to both a root and a permanent speed increase, again the last time I played one was in Legion.<br />
<br />
And as for survivability, you miss the part where I said or willfully ignore it in order to misrepresent my argument, BASELINE survivability. If a Prot Warrior has too little Rage they splat faster than any other tank class. The only spec one that comes close is the Prot Paladin spec. And both of those are down to utter design failures in those specs rather than player ability. <br />
<br />
It's irresponsible to make specs that depend on something and then have situations where those things are missing. <br />
<br />
Stagger is baseline survivability.<br />
<br />
DK has the Runic Power/Runes thing, which is something the player has control over themselves so that only fizzle out due to the player.<br />
<br />
DH can make Fragments and self-heal when they are out of CDs.<br />
<br />
Bears have a large Health Pool, armor and Dodge innately since they tank with their face.<br />
<br />
Prot Paladins are shit out of luck as well, however, they at least have control over their resource.<br />
<br />
Warriors are utterly dependant on procs, there's nothing we can do skill-wise to increase out survivability unless we Shield Wall, Demo Shout or Last Stand, catch them with those on CD and they only have Shield Block and no Rage, which we only get from Shield Slam and there's no SB. This is the reason Prot Warriors stack as much Haste as they can.<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with making them better, they have to do it in order to make them work. For Grievous weeks I use Impending Victory instead of Into the Fray and I can really feel the difference in my Rage build due to the lacking Haste.<br />
<br />
So if Warriors are no longer the tank that does the most damage of the tanks, AoE and single target, and nothing else changes then they're reduced to Worst Tank, which was a position they occupied until 8.1 where they were worth bringing again. No one, least of all the devs, wants to return to a situation where there's effectively -1 tank spec.<br />
<br />
This decision reeks of Blizzard making a panic change after the invitation and only looked at the effect instead of the cause and now they're lessening the effect without ever studying the cause.</div></div><hr />
