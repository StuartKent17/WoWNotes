Professor Putricide (Heroic) World First Kill by Paragon<br />
Paragon (http://www.paragon-wow.com/) just defeated Professor Putricide in heroic mode and gets another world first kill in Icecrown Citadel. They killed all the end-wing bosses and the lich king is next on the list (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/lich_king_next.jpg). Congratulations to them.<br />
<br />

<br />
However, killing the Lich King in heroic mode might be harder than it looks. According to the russian guild &#1069;&#1082;&#1079;&#1086;&#1088;&#1089;&#1091;&#1089; (http://exorsus.ru/) (EU-&#1056;&#1077;&#1074;&#1091;&#1097;&#1080;&#1081; &#1092;&#1100;&#1086;&#1088;&#1076;) the Lich King heroic mode has been buffed in 10-man instances and his health was buffed from 22.5M to 29.5M, making the fight look a lot harder now. It wouldn't be surprising if the buff also affected the 25-man version of the encounter. <br />

The limited attempt system may have pushed others to hoard attempts and work largely on alt raids until they feel they can get the kill with as few wipes as possible. Still it is a truly impressive run on Paragon's side.<br />
We do know that several mechanics changed on the rest of the fights on heroics so I think we can safely assume the same will be the case with the end of wing bosses and LK himself.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure Paragon requires alts of the same class/spec in order to practice the encounters. None the less 13 tries remaining is still impressive.</div></div><hr />

Means they wiped twice on average on each of the end of wing bosses before getting the kill. There have been bosses in this game that even good guilds would wipe to even months after killing them after all.</div></div><hr />

Having an alt isn't even required. Most people do but some don't. You don't &quot;lose&quot; anything or people won't think less of you if you don't have an alt in Paragon.</div></div><hr />

It is silly that they are denying using mirror raids though. We all know that most of the top guilds started using mirrors with the attempt system and we all know Paragon is one of them. This is, after all, the guild that made everyone level a warlock in order to have everyone in the raid with an SS on them. Regardless of using 1-2 mirror raids (or at least partial mirrors), getting up to H LK in the first week is still impressive. Paragon is undoubtedly the most effective guild out there right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ensidia don't care about any of these bosses, all they care about is Arthus, there testing the bosses in 10 mans for the attempt bosses; so when they do 25's they have maximum attempts on Arthus. I'd be suprised if Paragon got world first on Arthus 25 H, I don't see it but I could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

You seem to be &quot;knowing&quot; a lot here. Not a single player in Paragon has a main and alt of the same class. Simple as that. Also not everyone leveled a soulstone alt.<br />

You mean the fact, that top-of-the-pile progression guilds have always, since way back in classic, used whichever means available to them in the game to achieve World Firsts? <br />

its like last resort said on their page. to be competitive you have geared alts, and run them, and run your alts alts<br />

ohhhhh you were doing it a faster way then me hehe. i was multiplying his health by .1 and then subtracting the answer from his original amount of health. but we came out with the same answer anyways so never mind</div></div><hr />

This makes no sense. If you can't kill them on hardmode, you kill them on normal instead. You don't gain anything by not attempting them on hardmode. Goes for the lich king and all other bosses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lets assume adds will have about 60m, probably more...(if the fight lasts longer or hp of the adds are higher on heroic or something) <br />
<br />
that would be about 165m hp in total to burn, which leads to about 10.5 k dps from every dd at all times during the encounter :)<br />
maybe even close to 200m which would require 222k raiddps = 12.5-13k dps from every dd :)<br />

considering that some mages were only at 5.5k dps, this seems close to impossible to beat :D <br />

/sigh ulduar hardmodes were no different then the ones now (at least the ones that count) freya,thorim,hodir, and mimiron (not to sure about this guy) all lasted about 2 to 3 days just like the hardmodes that count in ICC (blood queen, sindragosa, and putricide). <br />
<br />
but here is the catch. these hardmodes were downed in the first week that ulduar came out so they were downed with the gear you acquired from 25 man naxx. the hardmodes from ICC didnt come out till this week aaaaaaaaand they were being downed with people already decked out in full 25 ICC gear. in other words there is no difference in how hard these bosses were to down in HM and if i wanna take this far enough i could say that the ICC hardmodes were harder since they took the same amount of time to kill as the ulduar hardmodes except the guilds had better gear for that level of raiding for the ICC bosses.<br />
<br />
sorry for the long text but i felt it was necessary for everyone going &quot;OMG DUDE ICC IS TOO EZ MODE!!! ME WANT ULDUAR BACK!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

After all you can gear up to that point without ever touching the Lich King on heroic, so why not design for it.

It is silly that they are denying using mirror raids though. We all know that most of the top guilds started using mirrors with the attempt system and we all know Paragon is one of them. This is, after all, the guild that made everyone level a warlock in order to have everyone in the raid with an SS on them. Regardless of using 1-2 mirror raids (or at least partial mirrors), getting up to H LK in the first week is still impressive. Paragon is undoubtedly the most effective guild out there right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And who says this is bad? Hardmodes WFs = whatever it takes, imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont know if the eagle eyed amongst you noticed the day the Saronite bombs dropped and Bou was posting all those wols screenies, there was for a brief time the full raid dps chart up, it got pulled real quick, but I can tell you even though the numbers were juicy they fell well short of this napkin math DD people are conjuring up for HM.<br />
<br />
I would imagine that Ensidia are still running there 2x &quot;mains&quot; raids to gear up for next or the week afters reset, whereas the frontrunner's now, have gone balls out for the finish line with the strongest possible setups, which when the dust settles will make Ensidia's current position of 9/12 with dual teams all that more impressive.<br />
Perfect execution cant get a 11k dps out of a 10k dps or a 15 out of a 14 ;) for that matter.<br />
<br />
All of that being said if a guild do get him this reset you have to admire the sheer tenacity.<br />
<br />
Im no Fanboi, just pointing out some info, I have thoroughly enjoyed this race, it has never been so close or exciting, genuinely popping onto internet to see how the race is going, keep up the fun for us all, and congratulations to all the top guilds who have done so well this reset.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Waterisbest</div><div class="date">2010-02-12, 08:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">/sigh ulduar hardmodes were no different then the ones now (at least the ones that count) freya,thorim,hodir, and mimiron (not to sure about this guy) all lasted about 2 to 3 days just like the hardmodes that count in ICC (blood queen, sindragosa, and putricide). <br />
<br />
but here is the catch. these hardmodes were downed in the first week that ulduar came out so they were downed with the gear you acquired from 25 man naxx. the hardmodes from ICC didnt come out till this week aaaaaaaaand they were being downed with people already decked out in full 25 ICC gear. in other words there is no difference in how hard these bosses were to down in HM and if i wanna take this far enough i could say that the ICC hardmodes were harder since they took the same amount of time to kill as the ulduar hardmodes except the guilds had better gear for that level of raiding for the ICC bosses.<br />
<br />
sorry for the long text but i felt it was necessary for everyone going &quot;OMG DUDE ICC IS TOO EZ MODE!!! ME WANT ULDUAR BACK!!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
I agree with you. However i was expecting the first 4 bosses to require ilvl 264 gear on heroic mode, the next 4 (rot/fes/dream/blood) to require ilvl 277 gear from the previous heroic bosses (lord/lady/ship/saur) to go down. The 3 end wing bosses to require ilvl277 from ALL the previous bosses and LK required full ilvl277 from the instance. Apparently all the encounters in icc25hc only required ilvl264 to beat (except LK, maybe). That is why all the bosses went down in the 1st week. Blizz under tuned the bosses on heroic mode according to me. A nice buff to LK, guessing its a true challenge now :D<br />
<br />
Grats to Paragon. You guys did awesome and deserve LK world first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you figure they have 6(?) healers, 3(?) tanks, 16 dedicated DPS. Let's say 3 tanks = 1 DPS, so 17 DPS.<br />
<br />
114,444 / 17 = 6058 DPS per person (2k+ per tank) to clear him. Seems reasonable, however:<br />
<br />
<br />
Best clear currently on World of Logs: 61m hp * .9 (enrage timer ends at 10%): 54.9m HP<br />
<br />
Got to phase 4 in 10m 23s, so 54,900,000/623 (10*60+23) = 88,121 DPS<br />
<br />
So the fastest clear on WoL currently is 15k DPS short of clearing hardmode, and then add on the additional fight mechanics.<br />
<br />
Should be a challenge, but not impossible.<br />

[br]<br />
<br />
You will not be prepared now the Lich King hits not one but two times over 9000 causing severe lag for the players who will most likely see multiple setbacks involving a melting icestone in the mountains. Though at the time this event will only occur when Mankrik's wife is found in the mountains, ONLY if the mountains were a setback of the previous sentence. We hope to fix this bug soontm. <br />
The Lich King will now have all his stats decreased by 60% when fighting against members from the guilds: Paragon, Exodus, vodka, For the Horde, Ensidia, Blood Legion, Stars, Adept, Inner Sanctum or Method. The Blizzard Staff hopes this will quell and annihalate most of the evil forum trolls that stalk the forums and throw toilet paper and eggs agains't their houses.</div></div><hr />

i read somewhere that blizzard says that &quot;cataclysm will fix it&quot;. so i guess that only after the pre cata patch comes online that the lich king will be doable in 25 hardmode.</div></div><hr />

Well...pretty much because good old arty is still sitting on his throne in the picture, and bolvar still hanging above him. The camera angle is only turned that way, you get the impression bolvar isnt there, where he is supposed to be.</div></div><hr />
