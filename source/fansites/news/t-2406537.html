World Quest UI Changes - Battle for Azeroth<br />
In Battle for Azeroth, it will be significantly more effort to group for World Quests due to new restrictions on what addons can do with the Group Finder. <br />
<br />
<br />
The default UI no longer offers the option to find a group for non-elite quests. The option is still there for Elite quests.<br />
Addons can no longer automatically create groups, even with a user pressing the button. The title and description can only be manually filled out.<br />
Users will have to manually add a title and create a group for world quests. You can't even paste text into the fields.<br />
Addons can still search for groups.<br />
<br />

I think they had a lot of performance issues because of people spamming Group Finder. <br />
<br />
Sad to see this go though. Back to 2 hours grinds to get your AP, Resource and other stuff you might need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So instead of fixing those issues, they are blocking players from accessing premade group finder.<br />
This is second time they fuck with group finder for this very reason. First they made group creation require hardware event, and now they are completely blocking it's usage.<br />
Nice fucking work Blizzard. Not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Btw I saw that comming they put 0 money back into the game nowadays and changing phases/servers put a huge load on servers which demands more server power = buying more servers) and ohh boy they cannot afford that. F*CK ALL OF YOU GREEDY F*CKERS! <br />

Was thinking of buying BFA 1 months after release date so that they can finish their bug and class design issue. But now dammit , with so much useless and shit changes + story nonsense . <br />

<br />
What I didn't like (and a huge con for me) was that it took out the RPG element of doing quests together... You'd automatically be grouped with people, you wouldn't say a word to each other anyway, you'd blindly zerg/AoE fest through the objective and then everyone would leave. Literally zero communication and teamwork...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well they’re not engaging that’s the problem.<br />
<br />
Running the same quest for the 49th time makes it hard to care, it’s better to just get it done as fast as possible.</div></div><hr />

Wait, you think it's a good idea to remove things that make it easier to group up with people, in an MMO game? <br />
<br />
They should make it easier to group up for a couple of minutes so people interact more, not less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doesn’t happen most of the time though does it. I’ve run world q’s using the ‘find group’ option probably 100 times and it without a doubt makes the shitty quests easier and more importantly faster.</div></div><hr />

This is pretty stupid considering that you complete WQ's much faster if you actually participate. Those who afking are wasting own and others time.<br />
I often create groups myself and if I see someone afking I immediately kick him.</div></div><hr />

And this will somehow stop these people being afk? No. People will still make groups all it did was make it more tedious to create one, because you have to fill out texts and search manually... It is just fucking stupid. Ion pruning the game as much as possible, it is not a meme anymore.<br />

<br />
I'm guessing this has been done because of issues with botting and and automated group swapping. I know people who do their emissary every day without fighting a single mob just flying to the location, clicking a button and then afking while other people finish the quests for them.<br />
<br />
The option to find groups with the group finder is still there when you need it...Besides, if you're auto-queuing for every non-elite group quest with a one-click addon you're just being lazy instead of playing the game anyway.<br />
<br />
But shouldn't they be looking at why people do not want to do their &quot;amazing and engaging content&quot;, as opposed to making it harder to skip?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Path of least resistance, really. If there's a way to complete something with less effort, people will use it. If there was a way to become immortal in raids and clear full Mythic and get the same rewards, I'm pretty sure plenty of people would use it regardless of how &quot;fun&quot; raiding is normally, because skipping hard work to get rewards is something very hard to turn down.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiri</div><div class="date">2018-06-25, 11:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this is a good change, although it obviously has both pros and cons. <br />
<br />
What I didn't like (and a huge con for me) was that it took out the RPG element of doing quests together... You'd automatically be grouped with people, you wouldn't say a word to each other anyway, you'd blindly zerg/AoE fest through the objective and then everyone would leave. Literally zero communication and teamwork...<br />
<br />
I think the issue here is that WQs simply do not need communication and teamwork. People would be less zerging/AoEing if these quests were actually challenging and fun. Most mobs do not even have cones to dodge or whatever. Just throw your rotation at them and they die. <br />
I mean, this change won't even increase communication and teamwork anyway. People will just solo those WQs instead of going through some tabs, typing the name in and hoping that someone else is also doing it. <br />
<br />
<br />
All this fake outrage, haha.<br />
<br />
You only need a group for elite quests, and that functionality is still there. If you're doing a &quot;kill x murlocs and loot x treasures&quot; style WQ you can group with players in the area, but why you would want to is beyond me other than you want to AFK it.<br />
<br />
Actually, it will be harder to get groups for the quests that you need people for. Simply because these addons also de-listed inactive groups and gave you a prompt to leave the group after finishing the quest. You get a lot more dead groups without that automation, since the blizzard UI is incapable of emulating that. Not everyone using those was being an afk leech, some of us just liked not having to sift through five groups to find one that is actually still doing the quest they literally signed up for.</div></div><hr />

I think it's clear that you are the one with mental issues not able to complete a simple quest on your own, haha. Also, you don't have to do the same quests over and over again, you can easily pick and choose which ones you do based on reward and efficiency. And like I pointed out earlier you can still group with people as they haven't removed the ability to group :rolleyes:.

Do you have reading problems too? Who said I have trouble completing the quests? This change will just make it so you spend more time with the UI than with the actual quests. Sorry, but if you want to progress fast you do really have to do all the quests no matter what and of a lifespan of 2 years it is just really boring and the only reason we are doing it because we are &quot;forced&quot; to because of progress system, which also includes getting new content . The only thing you will interact more is the game UI, but I guess any kind of interaction is good for you, enjoy your whisps with &quot;please inv&quot; lmao.</div></div><hr />

My friends always tell me that this is Blizzards stance in their game design. I usually don't agree but lately it sure has felt like it.<br />
<br />
Personally. For me. Like everything in this game; if I don't like it I just won't do it. When I came back from my break in Legion. WQT helped. I was already solo-ing all these world quests on all my alts. After the first time of doing them though they were no longer challenging or much fun. So it was great to be able to do it at a faster pace along with others. Some that I met even stayed along for other endeavors which was a nice plus. With this feature being effectively killed; I will just do BfA WQ's once then forget about them. I'm at the point that if it feels like a chore I won't take part in it. Will spend my time on other things in WoW. When I need a break I'll just hop back on FFIV and return later as per usual.</div></div><hr />

I can't disagree with that last part. The folks that sit on their mount while the rest of the group completes the quest are bad, but the RealmHop addon was even worse.<br />
<br />
That said, I do think it kills some of the interaction and community, even though it only applies to trivial quests. Maybe if Blizz hadn't run all our friends away from the game...</div></div><hr />

Yeah I really like the way this functions sort of like Rifts as well. You participate in the quest group and get ranked based on contribution which leads to bonus rewards for those that get ranked. It might not be easy for Bliz to implement but it would be much more engaging and encourage people to participate in WQ and contribute.<br />

Personally I hate the WQ addon change. It was just convenient, I'll go back to doing them on my own and not talking to anyone or grouping with anyone which seems to be the opposite of what an MMO should be....</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about &quot;interaction and community&quot;? There is no community in pressing a button, letting some randos complete your quest and then immediately dropping group. Stop talking such horseshit!</div></div><hr />

Yeah its pretty ridiculous that the excuse seems to be the small amount of people who join a group and don't participate at all. I often talk with people in these kind of groups (The world boss on Argus or just invasions, for example). And even lately I've been seeing the raids policing themselves and kicking people out who aren't contributing.<br />
<br />
But screw it. A fraction of people are abusing a system, better ruin it for everyone! Great move, Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The default UI no longer offers the option to find a group for non-elite quests. The option is still there for Elite quests.<br />
Addons can no longer automatically create groups, even with a user pressing the button. The title and description can only be manually filled out.<br />
Users will have to manually add a title and create a group for world quests. You can't even paste text into the fields.<br />
Addons can still search for groups.<br />

Contribute more = better rewards.<br />

Contribute less or not at all = no rewards/smaller rewards.<br />

I'm guessing this has been done because of issues with botting and and automated group swapping. I know people who do their emissary every day without fighting a single mob just flying to the location, clicking a button and then afking while other people finish the quests for them.<br />
<br />
The option to find groups with the group finder is still there when you need it...Besides, if you're auto-queuing for every non-elite group quest with a one-click addon you're just being lazy instead of playing the game anyway.<br />

I mean, this change won't even increase communication and teamwork anyway. People will just solo those WQs instead of going through some tabs, typing the name in and hoping that someone else is also doing it.<br />

WQ are repeatable quests, quests are mostly just zerg mobs and loot things... How do you apply FF14 FATES or WH PQ to these quests ? <br />

a lot of players one shot the mobs at WQs, but there are also fresh 110s and i'm liking the idea of creating a new group for them to join and easily finish the WQ. creating a group with the LFG-tool ist really not an option. even dos-tools are more userfriendly.<br />

<br />
I've done Emissary every single day in Legion, by using WQGF since it was released and I can say it's sometimes stupidly quick, but then again with current item levels and raid gear I can pretty much solo every single WQ in the game, including Argus. So I often don't even bother with grouping up with WQGF even if it was a couple of button presses away.<br />
<br />
Of course, in BfA combat (and everything) is a lot slower than in Legion so we can only hope our characters still get as powerful with better gear so we don't actually have to use WQGF except for most difficult rares.<br />
<br />
I just wish Blizzard would talk about these changes, instead of forcing them in with a Beta build with not a single word from the Devs. Then we have to wait for weeks for a Q&amp;A session and have the change explained there, by trying to use as much time possible to avoid other questions..<br />
<br />
I have to add that WQGF was really useful for realmhopping and dropping from combat, even from PvP combat and it worked even on so called &quot;PvP&quot; WQ's (towers). I actually used it more often in those situations, especially dropping myself from combat on Argus, where everything is broken and mobs have terrible rubberbanding issues which lock you in combat for days unless you realmhop away to drop from combat.. Should really roll a Rogue, I guess..?</div></div><hr />

I can't believe there are actually people who did all those world quest on their own.. those people can't be raiders that's for sure, because what you want is get that crap done ASAP and that's exactly what the addon helped to do, because.. who the hell enjoys world quests after 6 months?<br />
<br />
But one of the biggest change here is for leveling.. this was by far the most effective way to level doing the invasion world quests.. I have no idea if they had a similar system in BFA, but that will just kill easy leveling of alts.</div></div><hr />

When you have only ~1-2 hours to play, then time becomes a more precious commodity, especially when you want to get specific world quests done. It may shock you, but not everyone's life revolves around this game. :rolleyes: That is to say, if you assumed I'm being 'lazy', then you're being rather foolish; my issue is time constraints more than anything else, so naturally... I will use party finder if it saves me time.<br />
<br />
Most world quests I don't create parties for, but there are plenty I do. PvP quests are a big one, any kind of slow, grindy quest that takes more than 5 minutes solo because of competition or whatever are good candidates as well. For newly 110 alts, I also utilize the system a bit more than usual since I typically take a day or two before I'm ready to tackle world quests effortlessly solo... but even then, it depends. Most World Quests are really easy as you well know.<br />
<br />
The problem I have with this, is that this won't stop people from making groups for world quests, nor is forming groups for world quests even a bad thing in any way; it's just making it more tedious. I'm fine with Blizzard breaking world quest auto-join addons; frankly I always watch to see if players are in the same zone I am, or actually participating. (If not, I kick them. :cool:) <br />
<br />
My issue is with Blizzard even going so far as to remove the ability to copy-paste text. That just feels ridiculously overkill. Like they are making it tedious for the sake of making it tedious... :confused:</div></div><hr />

Yeah, how dare I want a tool that makes an MMO easier to play with other people! The fact that the game is online is purely so I can listen to political nonsense in trade chat, not actually get in groups to get things done quicker! /s<br />

Stop shielding behind &quot;to play with other people&quot; because is just bullshit, you are just mad because now you can't longer afk and leave asap.<br />

When you have only ~1-2 hours to play, then time becomes a more precious commodity, especially when you want to get specific world quests done. It may shock you, but not everyone's life revolves around this game. <br />
<br />
If you have only 2 hours it is your problem.<br />
<br />
don't play mmo</div></div><hr />

I cannot tell you how many times specially doing named on argus where using an addon to quickly hop into a group to get it done saved time. What is next you going to make bag addons not work so we have to open each and every bag or something just as silly. The change just shows how out of touch with the games community it really is and coming soon. Group finder addon via Blizzard from our store for 2.99 ---- i am joking but might not be far off base.</div></div><hr />

MMOs are designed to be played with other people. Just because something can be solo'd doesn't mean it has to be, so making it more difficult to group hurts everyone but the egotistical &quot;get gud and solo like me&quot; fuktards like you. Do I enjoy the addons because I love to communicate with other people and cheer in party chat &quot;go teamwork!&quot;? Of course not. Obviously I do it to make the quests faster. Just because there are occasional people that afk through them doesn't warrant punishing people that actually use it to help each other get the quests done faster. And if it doesn't hurt the e-peen players such as yourself (or the handful of players that perhaps just enjoy soloing repetitive content), why cripple those that have the brainpower to use an addon that makes grouping easier?</div></div><hr />

Doubtful. The people who are for this don't even seem to use the AddOn and yet they feel the need to comment on something they don't use. Especially the ones that are saying things about &quot;Oh you can't solo it? Git Gud, scrub.&quot;. If you are soloing the WQ's why should it matter what other people do? Oh, it doesn't?

For somebody who only 2 hours for wow, you are really wasting a lot of time on a forum trying to cope/defend with your own idiosyncrasy.<br />

<br />
What I didn't like (and a huge con for me) was that it took out the RPG element of doing quests together... You'd automatically be grouped with people, you wouldn't say a word to each other anyway, you'd blindly zerg/AoE fest through the objective and then everyone would leave. Literally zero communication and teamwork...<br />
<br />
ya but they seem to totally be fine with this is LFG dungeons and LFR. WQs are so poorly designed it's not even funny. They could do so much more with the system but they are lazy or not creative enough.<br />
<br />
There is ONE and only ONE reason for this change and it is to increase the play time metric for investors.</div></div><hr />

&quot;A small percent of people that use this addon just do it to leech, therefore anyone that uses it is a leech.&quot; Seems like a solid argument. Bowser's probably right here, you're just a bad troll.

I'm not even subscribed to World of Warcraft right now, and I dislike playing video games before I go out on principle.

They should make it easier to group up for a couple of minutes so people interact more, not less.<br />

Yeah, elites is where you &quot;need&quot; help anyway. Didn't know people queued for the easy quests. Except the afkers who can't be arsed to do quests themself. <br />
<br />
Copy/paste? How lazy are people? The ingame one you can just click the mark and you get groups, right click then que. Or if you make one, you click the marker, then go back in the group finder interface, then start group, insta-starts the group. <br />

Wouldn't surprise me if this is to help curtail the behaviour of CrossRealm / Realm Hopping via addon. I mean, those basically just search, sign up and allow you to join groups on other realms with a click.<br />

Who's joining groups for none-elite WQs anywho? Even healers have got enough nuke to get those mobs down quickly (if the quest even involves killing mobs, when we know a great deal are actually &quot;Click / Loot this thing&quot;).</div></div><hr />

Yes you do in 3rd-tier end-of-expansion-gear. No you don't in pre-1st-tier start-of-expansion-gear. Enjoy being pummeled on your non-tank-toon while tank-specs basically pull the entire place and rofl to victory...just as they did at the start of legion.<br />
<br />
I agree it should not be &quot;a big deal&quot;...but with an expansion that already has issues with the amount of end-game content it offeres and the incredible differences in solo-performance among specs when not totally overgeared make this a change that hits the wrong classes the hardest.<br />
<br />
Not a lot of people will care if you can or cannot group for quests where you can one-shot anything with any spec anyway...but that is simply not the case at expansion-launch. And sitting there eating with my mage while tanks are jumping around me pulling armies of mobs and then just sit on them with their ass to kill them is not fun.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerisot</div><div class="date">2018-06-25, 05:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Legion 2.0 would've been awesome. The best iteration of the game possibly ever only trumped by hardcore nostalgia glasses. This however is not Legion 2.0.<br />
<br />
This is legitimately Cata 2.0 right down to the bosses (Queen Azshara) and Kul'Tiras, they were both meant to be in Cataclysm but were taken out to make this expansion.<br />
<br />
I still remember when Cataclysm was announced, it was Deathwing and Queen Azshara as the main villains plotting to use the Maelstrom to reawaken an ancient evil (N'zoth) and even though Queen Azshara made a brief appearance in Darkshore she all of a sudden disappeared from the game, and the website.<br />
<br />
&quot;She was described on the Cataclysm version of the website as: Strong-willed, manipulative, and incomparably beautiful, Azshara possessed far more magical talent than almost any other night elf in her time. Ten thousand years ago, she and the other Highborne brought Azeroth dangerously close to complete destruction when their meddling with arcane magic caught the attention of the Great Enemy, Sargeras. Corrupted by the influence of the fallen titan, Azshara set in motion a plan to bring the Burning Legion to Azeroth, a plan that caused the War of the Ancients and the Great Sundering of Azeroth. Beautiful, cruel Azshara was swallowed by the seas, never to be seen again... or so it was believed. The naga revere Azshara as a demigod, one who is still very much alive. How she could have survived the Sundering, and at what cost, remain mysteries that not many would dare to probe.&quot;<br />

Copy/paste? How lazy are people? The ingame one you can just click the mark and you get groups, right click then que. Or if you make one, you click the marker, then go back in the group finder interface, then start group, insta-starts the group. <br />
<br />
Tedious, &quot;I don't want to do the content but I want the reward&quot; mentality ftw.<br />
<br />
I mostly agree with you, but lets be honest, people group for non-elite WQ's because they can. If you can get a 2 minute WQ done in 1 minute, well, why not? Some WQ's with low mob density can be done in a fraction of the time via a group, especially back in the days before flying. <br />
<br />
Just because something can be done a certain way, doesn't mean there aren't efficiency gains to be had by doing it another. The old &quot;Don't hate the player hate the game&quot; comes to mind. Perhaps players have simply grown tired of the &quot;Kill 10 bears&quot; type of WQ's?<br />
<br />
Anyway, as I said, not really disagreeing with you. The Sky isn't falling, but I will miss the QoL those addons brought in BFA.<br />
<br />
-edit-<br />
<br />
Then again, I should mention that I play classes with Tank specs. I think some of the more squishier specs might have forgotten what WQ's were like pre raid gear and pre flying.</div></div><hr />

People that don't want to compete with folks in their own faction who kill things in two shots. People who don't mind if their kills speed up someone else if someone else's kills speed up one's own progress.<br />
<br />
All told I understand this change, as someone who it is targeted straight at. Let's be real folks, quick-grouping for non-elite WQs is not a sociability decision, it's a speed decision. No one views the other folks in WQGF as other actual people, come on now. :P</div></div><hr />

To be fair, I found people that used WQGF for normal quests were the ones that were the biggest leeches. You don't need a group for 5 people to do a quest which requires only the ability to breath to be able to complete it. Most just did it because they knew 1 of the 5 people that joined the group would do it whilst the rest would just afk or fly past.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The two have nothing to do with each other, since it depends how it affects the content as well as the consumption of that content. <br />
<br />
For example, a person could argue that the auto-group feature should be extended to mythic raiding and that the cap of 20 raiders be eliminated. Sure, that'd give you more options for how to consume that content, but it would also immediately render it trivial since a group of 50 players zipping through a mythic raid would destroy it in minutes. The result would be apathy for mythic raiding and it would harm the game and player experience overall.<br />
<br />
Bottom line: Based on the changes they are making, it tells you that group finder was conflicting with the design of how the devs intended or intend the content to be consumed. And if that is the case, then the changes are logical.</div></div><hr />

No you don't in pre-1st-tier start-of-expansion-gear. Enjoy being pummeled on your non-tank-toon while tank-specs basically pull the entire place and rofl to victory...just as they did at the start of legion.<br />
<br />
I agree it should not be &quot;a big deal&quot;...but with an expansion that already has issues with the amount of end-game content it offeres and the incredible differences in solo-performance among specs when not totally overgeared make this a change that hits the wrong classes the hardest.<br />
<br />
Not a lot of people will care if you can or cannot group for quests where you can one-shot anything with any spec anyway...but that is simply not the case at expansion-launch. And sitting there eating with my mage while tanks are jumping around me pulling armies of mobs and then just sit on them with their ass to kill them is not fun.<br />
<br />
No, I did it all the way. Leveled as healer too, early in the expansion as well(3 weeks in) and my mage was the first one I leveled in Legion. And now we got scaling, and it's awesome. Coming to argus with my 815 healer, or a clothie, no problem. Not had a problem with any spec in Legion, not at launch, not now. <br />
<br />
I got all classes too, and I have had zero issues, and none of those were tanks :P<br />
<br />
But yeah, it is not a big deal. You can still que for the elite-quests, and if you really struggle you can search the quest up and find someone. Yes, it takes few seconds more, and yes it is silly that they change it, but the addon is not needed, at all.</div></div><hr />

I am dubious that these changes will have a positive experience for making grouping easier.<br />
<br />
Having to manually fill in the name is really the worst part. Already people manually completing names can be a pain in the ass because sometimes people put shortened named/abbreviations or leave out apostrophes, and sometimes they put the mob name and sometimes the quest name or the event (&quot;invasion&quot;) or make typos... so already have to search for a few different things to find results sometimes. I'm apprehensive this will make it worse and I'll be back to sitting around by shit I can't solo and hoping someone shows up. Many lazy people will probably not bother listing or searching at all, but even the people who are more motivated will be impacted by groups being less common and slower to fill with the elimination of people who decide it's not worth the effort to bother anymore.<br />
<br />
I mean, at the end of the day it probably isn't a huge deal, but the ease of grouping with people really made the game feel like less of a solo experience, was very helpful for things you couldn't solo, and also made it easier for people to share rare mob spawns and things like that. I feel like adding even little speedbumps to that experience will have a negative impact. And for what end? To punish the few assholes that are botting or just group and never help? Why not let the community self police and remove those people manually like they do now or give more tools to action them.</div></div><hr />

Doing this will have consequences. Firstly, the new &quot;artifact weapon&quot; feels useless. Many people won't even bother to farm AP. This means that the encounter with players will be less when doing WQs for AP. Secondly, people want to save as much time as possible. Getting rid of a QoL addon that helped us do that would push a lot of people away. Also, all of the rewards are worse compared to Legion. Gold from a Rare WQ inn BfA is equal to a normal in legion. Also, as long as I've done WQs in Beta, I feel like the gear you get is for fewer slots compared to Legion. (Not a lot, maybe 2/3 slots less but still a hit). Finally, there are no &quot;legendaries&quot; for people to grind. So there is no point in doing the WQs. Add all of that with the WQGF removal, and we get an almost dead feature.</div></div><hr />

Not everyone. I would rarely say anything to others in the group since I am not one for small talk, but I didn't treat them badly either. I would sometimes stick around for a little bit even after having finished the WQ if a newer group member just needed a couple more kills to finish.<br />

Actually as havoc DH, i find its quicker to solo. I can round up mobs and burn them down in a global, if no one interferes. I also need to get killing blows for soul fragments.

I recognize that it exists in order to keep a certain number of people online, and that without them (or something like them) people would quickly stop bothering to log in for long enough to make it feel like a MMO. I don't have any better ideas on how an MMO can keep people &quot;in the world&quot; for 1-2 hours per day for months at a time, which is obviously necessary in order to make the game feel alive. But I still hate them.<br />
<br />
Regardless, I think addons in general are bad for the game, whether they make the game more fun or not, because they remove players' ability to identify with each others' experiences. Someone who uses an addon to trivialize WQs has no commonality of experience of them with someone who doesn't use an addon, and it results in impossible design decisions regarding which set of players to cater to. The same thing is true for stuff like DBM, although Blizz has gone the other way on that one: instead of designing the game to make raid addons unecessary, they design them to actually be effectively impossible without them, which ruins the experience for anyone who just wants to learn a raid with a group.<br />
<br />
So I'm all for the change I guess, even though I actually hate the impact on gameplay, because hopefully it makes it a little easier to make more engaging content in general.</div></div><hr />

If there's a way to complete something with less effort, people will use it. If there was a way to become immortal in raids and clear full Mythic and get the same rewards, I'm pretty sure plenty of people would use it regardless of how &quot;fun&quot; raiding is normally, because skipping hard work to get rewards is something very hard to turn down.<br />
<br />
I agree, but if the path of least resistance is to actually install an addon (and that alone is a problem for vast majority of players, I still remember repeating the same mantra about needing a loot addon if you want to see loot and AA to see assignments, every time we had new recruits, and that's in addition to it being organized mythic raiding and being told during recruitment, having it in GMotD and in guild info) and constantly be managing it by joining groups, as opposed to simply playing the game, there is a problem.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mekatron</div><div class="date">2018-06-25, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think it's clear that you are the one with mental issues not able to complete a simple quest on your own, haha. Also, you don't have to do the same quests over and over again, you can easily pick and choose which ones you do based on reward and efficiency. And like I pointed out earlier you can still group with people as they haven't removed the ability to group :rolleyes:. You just have to interact player to player now, shocking isn't it?<br />
<br />
Everybody is *able* to complete any wquest on their own, don´t be silly. It´s a matter of math. Do u wanna spend:<br />
a) 1 or <br />
b) 4 minutes doing something u have done before a hundred times?<br />
<br />
Isn´t it obvious? <br />
<br />
Look at the design of Highmountain wquests: there´s absolutely nothing complex involved in completing them, BUT they tend to have 4-5 different objectives each: kill X mobs, close Y portals, revive W npcs, open T cages then fight the miniboss that ONLY spawns after u done that. Sometimes the respawn rate of said mobs is low and u just have to stand in one point waiting or u risk running pointlessly in circles. Sometimes they are spacially far from each other. The EXTRA-PLUS: the quests there very often happen in a cave, where u can´t mount to speed things up and have terrible visibility. It´s not about complexity per se, it´s the details that make u spend so much time. Why not make killing 5 mobs instead of 12? Not complex at all. Just keeping u busy. If 5 ppl were doing the objectives, 1 or 2 can handle each type of task and voilá, everybody wins, u can even have 20 mobs, it´s gonna be faster. It´s simple math and it´s actually FUN to have ppl cooperating.<br />
<br />
Treating the casual leeches as if they are the rule and are ruining the experience is simply RIDICULOUS, I do dozens of wqs daily and I barely notice leeches, because it goes insanely faster.<br />
<br />
Altough Blizz is not removing our ability to group up, they are making it artificially harder in order to increase the time it takes for us to complete things, interrupting the fluidity and the pragmatism of it.<br />
<br />
Our brain reacts differently to known and fresh things. In time, muscle memory and the need of conclusion take place, wich is why I find completely unnnatural the way blizz handled this matter. We´re gonna have to type things, then correct strange names with double L´s, or Y´s in place of I´s, and wait for the interface to show, then decide in what group u´ll go, with the risk of not being accepted, or it being delisted right when u clicked, then u gotta refresh the search and do it all over again while your character sits there doing nothing at the edge of the objectives. Boy, and with the new warmode and bounty, being stil because u HAVE to type things in an interface that takes half the screen is the last thing u wanna do... Tell me how is that gonna improve player interaction or the experience of playing the game?<br />
<br />
Also, what is, exactly, interacting with other players? To ask how is their day? How´s their mom doing? Where did they drop that mount or gear? It´s 2018, ppl dont have time to engage in small talk so often, their ingame time is finite and blizz should respect that. Times changed, yes. Parents spend less time with their kids, wich spend less time with their friends, and so on. We´re all burdened with things and a videogame shouldn´t emulate THAT part of modern life.<br />
<br />
Effort? Yes, absolutely, don´t take effort away. I´ve had some lucky mount drops in the first try and I confess I didn´t enjoy the mount so much, because it was kinda of voidy/effortless.<br />
But too much effort has the exact same impact. What u do matters so much, that u will feel the weight of it when u happen to not have the time.<br />
<br />
The way I see it, if u really want/need to interact, it´s for a specific goal/moment, wich is brief BY NATURE.<br />
<br />
By design, such things almost dont exist anymore. World bosses dont have unforgiving mechanics anymore, it´s just a matter of number of ppl. (Remember OOndasta?) Sister Subversia in Argus WILL mind-control everyone who doesnt get out of her radius, and u will have to deal with them, because designers decided to no give us the ability to stun or interrupt her spell, and when u say GET OUT OF THE CIRCLE no one reads anyway, so what exactly is expected from the playerbase? That veterans or attentive ppl teach others to play the game ----&gt; and that is what fun is about??? No. Tops, u throw a heal on them, u ask for a certain-duration buff... those things are character interactions, not everyone wants to be recognized as a person behind the character and needs that kind of attention.<br />
<br />
And automate-grouping has nothing to do with that, it doesnt make interaction less probable to happen to people that WANT IT to happen. The problem is to think everybody WANTS to spend a lot of time talking about things that grow old in a matter of days.<br />
<br />
Ppl dont &quot;interact more&quot; because they dont want to. If they want, they will spend some time talking in their guild, during intervals in dungeons or the new communities or whatever, u will not find your perfect buddy of chores doing world quests, get over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;What stupid decision has been announced overnight that will make me wanna go all Foghorn Leghorn on a Blizzard developer&quot; <br />
<br />
I then click on MMO champ and sure enough 9 times out of 10 I read WTF stories like today's post. Blizzard, Seriously? <br />
Who thought this was a good idea to restrict the ability of grouping easily in an MMO. As others who are as equally frustrated as I am have mentioned, RIFT did this &quot;Automatically&quot; from launch 7 years ago! It felt like you were in a world larger than just you when you got close to an objective and suddenly were part of a group all working on the same goal. <br />
<br />
Now I get that WQ's were new this exp and we haven't needed to form groups for quests very much in the past bar a few elite mobs sprinkled in at the end of quest lines. And with the amount of content added in Legion, some QoL UI improvements didn't make it in. But to actively break addon's which have done a reasonably good job at improving areas that you haven't is such a blatantly dumb move that it questions your motives. Making it easy for players who want to group up to kill WQ's efficiently does not ruin the experience of players who wish to kill it solo. After all this is supposed to be an MMO, we are supposed to work together, supposed to group up. <br />
<br />
It feels like the focus from you isn't based on players enjoyment, ever, in any way, anymore. It's is all an attempt to douse the flames and control what players can and can't enjoy. Like the only way you think you can end this is to keep removing ways for us to enjoy it. If you make it painful, slow, hard work then people will stop wanting to play the game and you can move on to something else. Those changes didn't slow players enough so lets add GCD to more things, let's remove more spells, remove xp bonuses, make them ride ground mounts longer, make the numbers so ludicrously large that they cringe at the thought of logging on and grinding more, reduce the rewards hell lets throw in more RNG, more RNG, MORE RNG. Wait has someone made the game better with an addon? BREAK IT! Seriously stop making dumb decisions and forcing us backwards. If you don't want to keep the game going just end it. We pulled the big sword out and Azeroth blew up, shit we all dead. Thanks for playing World of Warcraft. The END...<br />
<br />
This negative expectation shouldn't be what we all fear every morning that we log in. Wow is a game to enjoy in our social time. It should be fun, it should be exciting. We should be sitting here smiling with anticipation, just like the first time your girlfriend reaches back to unclip her bra. Next time that dev proposes a change, ask yourselves is that the type of excitement this change would bring? Gamers, game for Fun!</div></div><hr />

Smh, the issue was never with the difficulty, it's about efficiency. Even if I can aoe down entire villages by myself, having somebody else aoe the next town over speeds up the completion rate immensely.

While elite quest are still in the group finder, they are completely taking out the automation. Many of the quest in late game are not elite, but was much easier to do in groups. <br />

I've played Legion since day 1, used WQGF for pretty much 100% of that time. I can count the amount of times I was put into a group with a leecher in it on one hand.<br />
<br />
Literal thousands of world quests done using the addon, maybe 3 or 4 leechers total throughout the entire expansion.<br />
<br />
It's also funny you say this because a lot of world quests require actual player interaction with objectives to complete.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />

Path of least resistance, really. If there's a way to complete something with less effort, people will use it.

<br />
And why should it take x amount of time longer than it needs to? Especially if I've already done a particular world quest 500 times?<br />
<br />
Do a little bit of math.<br />
<br />
If I do 2000 world quests and the addon saves me just 1 minute per quest that's 33 hours saved. 33 hours NOT SPENT DOING WORLD QUESTS.<br />
<br />
I don't know about anyone else but that's a lot of fucking time I could be doing something I actually enjoy instead of wasting it on pleb tier content that becomes relatively outdated about 5 minutes after you hit max level. And that's just if it saves you one minute per quest, often it's much more than that.<br />

A good change, too much automation in grouping for quests.<br />

People don't group cause the quests are hard they group specifically to make the quests go quicker because they are boring, and tedious for no reason.<br />

I think this is a good change, although it obviously has both pros and cons. <br />
<br />
What I didn't like (and a huge con for me) was that it took out the RPG element of doing quests together... You'd automatically be grouped with people, you wouldn't say a word to each other anyway, you'd blindly zerg/AoE fest through the objective and then everyone would leave. Literally zero communication and teamwork...<br />

<br />
<br />
I'm a mythic raider and have done every AP WQ every day for 2 years without the use of these addons and without complaining. I join Argus elites using the Blizzard UI if it's not up on my realm but otherwise these addons are not time saving at all for a vast majority of WQs. You'll spend more time hopping and dropping than you will actually contributing to completing the world quest. Joining a group, killing two mobs, and having other people do the work for you is not conducive to a good gaming experience. You people are joking when you say you actually talk to people in these groups. The most communication that happens is [WQGF] Quest complete! \n Bob has left the party.<br />
<br />
It is not a lot to ask people to actually play the game. Obviously people gravitate towards the path of least resistance and what they think is quickest but this kind of gameplay is detrimental to the actual experience, hence the change. If you don't want to do a WQ for the 100th time, don't do it. For the last year (since AP changes), no one is really forced to do it. You either do it because you want to or you don't do it at all.</div></div><hr />

Seriously ? My hunter can clear most of the quests involving killing mobs in literally SECONDS. Just aggro everything and aoe... Remember the begin of Legion it was NOT like that, that not how wow is meant to be played, even in previous extensions we didnt destroy quest mobs like this. And you're still saying it takes too much time ? Come on, don't play mmorpg. And after a while you dont do ALL the wq anyway, I never did...<br />
<br />
How can people STOP the game over something most of players weren't using (only bot/farmers/people with 50 alts) ? Is that how it works in America ?<br />
<br />
And FYI I was into hardcore raiding until Cataclysm and I'm now more casual but I still try to min max and I use useful addons in raid and in the outside world... so no I'm not a noob with the legacy interface without addons...<br />
<br />
I'm GLAD of this change, bear with it, never have been a fan of ultra rushing. And Blizzard its right, whats the point of making all of these quests if people just auto group and afk while mages kill the mobs..........

Players are lazy because they don't want to take longer to do something they've done repeatedly, hundreds to thousands of times already?<br />

I'm 30, I'm playing since Vanilla beta (with some pauses) and I have a full time job. I have only 1 main and my alts are just lvl max without anything more. <br />
Why would I need this stupid auto noob addon ? I can rush the emissary quest in 15 min MAX. I must have killed ragnaros or LK at least 100 times each. I know what &quot;'farming content&quot; means, thanks bro.</div></div><hr />

thats great! i hope you dont use any addon because after all they're all auto noob addons at the end of the day - you should be able to do everything with the vanilla UI!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno, I never had issues doing them normal or elite. Only time I even looked for groups was the World Boss ones. Maybe spoiled playing Ret/Prot Paladin and just flat-out outlasting anything I fight that isn't intended for 5+ people. But this has been the design intent since MISTS: Don't do all the content at once. Pace yourself. 99% of all players are NOT on the bleeding-edge, world-first-racing guild rosters. And that bunch have long since come to acceptance, and likely just roll in guild groups to do that stuff anyways.<br />
<br />
So you lost a little tool to automate a process you should be able to plow through without issue anyways. What is the big deal, really? This was done to combat bots primarily. Yes, it sucks. That is how it goes though: A few bad apples spoil it for the bunch.<br />
<br />
And if &quot;THIS&quot; is the straw that broke the camel's back, to cause you to quit... you already had quit, and are simply using this as an excuse. MMOs are about the grind, the time-investment. If you aren't doing it, you aren't actually playing. And I've been in this game since the start, when I was only 20. I was there, raiding MC, BWL, AQ40, and Naxx for more hours a week than I worked at my job, on top of the farming for mats I had to do off raid time for potions, ammo (Hunter back then), and such. I've been in the worst grind-era this game has EVER seen. This? This is nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
good point - be interesting to see what happens when it hits! i actually have being doing the 'manual' method of trying to setup groups on beta - i have yet to have ANYONE join the group - normally after 10 minutes someone turns up and we complete the quest - making it more difficult to setup a group (ie no cut and paste) will be even more irritating - i probably wont even bother... the funny thing is this wont be an issue come launch (in fact it will be the usual tag spam fest as per every expansion) but 1 year later i can see this being a problem...which is how these addons came into existance in the first place...</div></div><hr />

The lengths they are willing to go to artificially inflate their only KPI are disgusting.<br />

<br />
It is not needed, but doing so greatly reduces the time required to complete them. Many people still playing the game actually have lives now, so they would like to spend the limited time they have to play the game doing content that is fun, engaging and challenging. World quests are none of that (I wouldn't even call them content, since most of them are rehashed regular quests anyway), but are pretty much required for your character progression, not to mention a lot of the actual content is heavily gated behind them.</div></div><hr />

It helps when playing freshly leveled characters or healers. I have a priest alt. Hate new iteration of shadow spec, so I'm questing in disc. Things take much longer to die than any dps spec. so I always used group finder. This change kills priest class for me.</div></div><hr />

That was with DBM and some of the features it had for certain fights..<br />
<br />
The difference is that content requires a little bit of thought to get through. I'm honestly surprised that needs to be pointed out.<br />

So you are against the LFD and LFR queues as well?<br />
<br />
You're right, I guess the problems isn't in the grouping or how the groups formed act, but rather the design of World Quests and dungeons/raids. If they were tuned to be impossible to zerg and required coordination then these things would happen... but they don't.<br />
<br />
So it definitely seems more of an issue of the design. No?</div></div><hr />
