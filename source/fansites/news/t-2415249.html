Leveling Speed Feedback and Upcoming Changes<br />
Leveling Speed Feedback and Upcoming Changes<br />
Anecdotal evidence as seen through these threads would indicate that the majority of your player base fall squarely on the other side of the issue.<br />
I totally get what you're saying but, you only have your side of what you see which people who are usually complacent and happy don't have complaints about it. Also critical posts typically are the ones that people rally behind rather than positive, which is just how the internet works, but its fine just explaining the perspective. You also have to realize that WoW has millions of players, only a small percentage of them post on the forums. So while it seems anecdotal, for the development team they have data for these kinds of decisions.<br />
<br />
I'm having a lot of difficulty finding the players who enjoy this slowed leveling in the sea of those complaining quite loudly that they do not. Not saying they don't exist, just saying they are proving very uncommon. And while it is true the forums heavily favor complaints, I did not see a massive outcry over the inclusion of Elixir of Rapid mind and Ancient Knowledge.<br />
<br />
Also, WoW has been iterated on for many MANY years since BC/vanilla. The players who enjoyed that sort of thing have gravitated away naturally over time to be replaced by players who acclimated to a certain leveling speed.<br />
<br />
This trend was accelerated by the LFD tool, and likely made irreversible by the inclusion of LFR. It's simply not the same playerbase you had. And those same players who prefer the old style will be getting it back 100% when Classic drops anyway.<br />
<br />
Retail should be retail. WoW is a themepark MMO now, and there is simply too much waiting in line to get on the rides.<br />
Yeah its kinda hard to see the positive sometimes, I spoke about this in the first reply in this post so just copy past that here! (That was kind of convenient!). I was surprised at that as well. Really the flasks were kind of a niche thing that didn't really have a whole lot of use with players. Especially since they weren't as easy to get, I do miss the gold you got from selling the Rapid Mind flasks though.<br />
<br />
It's like you said a challenge when you're used to something for so many years. It was something the team had identified and wanted to fix for awhile but finally had the chance with that patch. <br />
<br />
Ythisens, have you looked into the issues regarding the drastic reduction in leveling XP in dungeons when grouped with someone who is at the max level of that particular expansion?<br />
Thanks for this! I'll pass that on. <br />
<br />
This character has been leveling completely after the prepatch came out and I've tried to keep records: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20766256516#post-8<br />
This is pretty great! Pretty cool treating the experience as a journal and the decisions you're making, as well as how it feels post 7.3.5.<br />
<br />
If any of the communication thus far, or the lack of visible action, has given the impression that we don't consider the issues raised in this thread and others like it to be a problem, I'd like to emphatically state that nothing could be farther from the truth. <br />
<br />
At this point, the feel and pacing of the level-up experience is a top priority for the team. We made deliberate changes to the feel of combat six months ago in 7.3.5, moving away from a world where low-level players (especially with heirlooms) could often kill outdoor enemies in 3-4 seconds, and where dungeon mobs died so quickly that a caster with a long windup might not even get a single spell off. Those changes were controversial at the time, but we stand by them as an improvement to the overall pacing of the game. But we also think that those changes went quite far enough, and have absolutely no desire or intent to continue moving in that direction. Nothing about the pre-patch was deliberately intended to make combat take longer than it did previously.<br />
<br />
So why haven't we fixed it yet? Honestly, because we genuinely don't know where exactly the problem lies, and we don't want to make a blind blanket change that actually misses the real source of the problem. That's why much of Ythisens' and others' messages thus far have been asking the community for detailed examples to guide our search.<br />
<br />
We &quot;squished&quot; stats and item levels, but this was done with the aim of being neutral with respect to the duration and lethality of combat. When we heard complaints about things taking too long to kill, we immediately assumed we'd gotten those calculations wrong. But a look at the raw data didn't suggest any clear anomalies. So we started testing empirically: We can run internal 7.3.5 builds, so we set up test characters (e.g. a level 70 wearing appropriate quest gear awarded by quests around that level - Item Level 115 in 7.3.5, Item Level 79 in 8.0.1) and fight outdoor enemies in 7.3.5, and then take the same character in 8.0.1 and fight the same enemies, and compare. <br />
<br />
We are seeing the same sort of discrepancies that folks in this thread and others have pointed out, but still have yet to pinpoint the exact aspect of scaling that we failed to account for. We want to understand WHY the numbers are off and fix the underlying cause: Were stats on gear reduced too much? Some aspect of creature armor or other combat calculations? Are our baseline values accurate, but the shape of the scaling curve wrong such that it’s particularly far off the mark in the 60-80 range? We would prefer a targeted solution versus just applying a bandaid fix that could mask deeper issues that could cause problems down the line, but at some point it’s not fair to give you a degraded experience for the sake of that investigation, so we’ll likely go ahead with a blanket health reduction in the near future while we continue to investigate.<br />
<br />
Either way, the current state is not the game experience we intended, and it’s something we will fix.<br />
<br />
There is another issue tangentially related to this discussion that I also would like to address: Many feel that it takes too long to level in the 60-80 range in particular, and that the combat pacing issues discussed here are just a piece of that larger problem. We agree – currently players are taking about 15% longer per level, on average, in that range as compared to before 60 or after 80. We’re in the process of assembling a set of changes that will smooth out the experience curve at level 60 and beyond, reducing the experience requirements for those levels.<br />
<br />
We’ll have further updates as specific changes roll out, but we’re prioritizing our work on this problem and hoping to get these improvements out to everyone in the coming days.

<br />
Dungeon Bonus Experience<br />
We identified an issue with the dungeon completion bonus which meant that players were only receiving 1/5th of the EXP they should be getting (due to the way EXP works in a group). I've been informed that this issue should now be resolved, so you should be receiving a large amount of EXP upon completing a dungeon now. If this isn't the case please do let me know.

<br />
<br />
RP Realm Sharding<br />
There's a lot of commotion on the RP realms about sharding returning, it's really not welcome on the RP realms, however, I assume this is only temporary to help with BFA's launch?<br />
By default, sharding is always disabled on RP realms, except where needed for server stability. When events drive large numbers of players to specific areas, we shard them as needed. Sharding has once again been disabled, but we expect it will be needed for launch events soon. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1022566187266232320))<br />

<br />
before blizz was run by a board of 11 people (6 of which were activision hires) i'd say no way, they don't do things like that, it's always about the game first.<br />
<br />
since activision took over control of wow's monetization, it's 100% possible that slower leveling was done to increase the people paying $60 to skip it, while also requiring more sub uptime to level those alts. they have the data that we'll never see that shows if this is a viable tactic, and yes, today blizz is more concerned with profit than how fun wow is. whatever balance they have to strike to maximize profit at the expense of the game is 100% what they'll do, it's how every single entity under activision's umbrella operates</div></div><hr />

So tired of all these people complaining about boosts, yea sure they are pushing them on us and say it's for the game's experience we all know that's bullshit and they just wanna make more money but that's fine guys.

<br />
Do you think getting to end game slower is better for new players? WoW has not been about just the leveling experience since Vanilla. There's far too much to do at max level now to require people, especially casuals you're trying to bring into it for the $, to spend even more time leveling.<br />
<br />
Not to mention a lot of your current loyal sub base have multiple characters they level from expansion to expansion, and will level more with allied races. I don't think you want people playing less of your game over something as trivial as leveling. Don't annoy your player base, cater to them. It was fine by the dev team for YEARS to level fast, the sudden flip flop is frustrating.<br />
<br />
I'd personally love to level more classes before BfA to possibly try them out but I am A) Not doing that with current rate B) buying anymore boosts. I've purchased around 15 since their inception<br />
<br />
I played Vanilla and leveled 2 characters through that. I am not ever looking to grind like that again to begin the game that WoW has become today</div></div><hr />

<br />
After leveling chars pre- and post-patch, I think the issue I've notice that's different in leveling is the stats squish... in conjunction the class overhauls. Especially when you hit WoD, the health on some mobs is ridiculous to where it's actually slower killing certain mobs than when WoD was current content (however the damage the mobs deal is probably correct, even kinder than content prior to it... healing some of those BC/WotLK/Cata dungeons is brutal right now if your group doesn't know how to play). <br />
<br />
Had a lvl 90 ret paladin in a dungeon that was likely a forgotten alt as they had SoO raid gear, and they were able to do 4k-7k single target damage... which is on par or better than a 110 ret paladin in mythic Argus gear (even a BoA geared lvl 90 ret probably does sub-2k ST under ideal circumstances). What is the cause? I'd allow the argument that broken scaling with gear, but even then the gear scaling is pretty terrible with respect to class output compared to how the content ramps up until you hit Legion content. Perhaps it's a misconception with their model, as they attributed the decrease in Legion mob difficulty/health (lower than even previous expansion content in some cases) to the artifact weapon losses, but in reality they were losing artifact weapons and overhauling classes concurrently. If I had to put my finger on it, I'd say class scaling doesn't mesh with the stats squish outside of Legion content. Heck, there were issues with it prior to pre-patch, but they've just been amplified.</div></div><hr />

My god people...<br />
<br />
What is your opinion for why they made leveling take longer then?<br />
Over the years the only complaints about leveling has been how boring and tedious it is.<br />
And their decision is to make it even more tedious? And at the same time start pushing character boosts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The new scaling allows people to finish zones and level more seamlessly between them(not to mention more freedom in where you want to level and what you want to skip). It also gives people a chance to experience stories they might not have done before - this is also nice for newer players. The heritage sets are also a big indicator they want people to level and it nice for people collecting quest transmogs.<br />
<br />
Also speaking of complaints, another one is people saying leveling is too fast and doesn't matter anymore, well now it's slower and matters if you want it to - it's still pretty fast depending on how you do it. <br />
<br />
Are they in the business of making money? Sure, not saying they aint but they also want people to experience and enjoy their game ALL OF IT.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like leveling and got all classes at max and that void-elf is my 2nd warrior because i dont like worgen animation/graphic so i didnt want to pay for race change and wanted to get their heritage armor.<br />

There have also been complaints that new players don't get any chance to actually play their class until max level and then when they NEED to know how to play it they can't. They press 1 or 2 button from lvl 1-100. Honestly, I've played games as a new player with that kind of gameplay and it feels hollow and I lose interest in getting to max level and quit.<br />
Do I think their route is the way to go? Probably not, it needs more changes. Do I think it's some way to get players who have leveled multiple toons to max level to just buy a boost? Lol get real.</div></div><hr />

I see that argument a lot, but it's pretty flimsy. Mostly because so many classes just play very differently at max level raiding than they do for 1-110 questing - and because there's nothing that actually TEACHES you how to play the class properly. A naive, new player will not notice they're doing something sub-optimal, because they have no basis for comparison. The only ones who do are players who already have a metric to go by, meaning they already know what performance looks like and how to look into achieving it. Without any sort of actual mechanic introducing players to proper play, the whole &quot;learn your class period&quot; argument is largely meaningless. In fact, I've heard from multiple new players that they felt very shocked how different max level play was to what they had become used to, and how confused they were that their leveling &quot;rotations&quot; did jack all in serious content.<br />
<br />
Anyway, all the rhetoric from blues so far smells a lot like spin to me. They know full well that they slowed down the leveling experience by a shitload, and did so intentionally. The squish and power creep concerns just gave them a convenient excuse to set a new paradigm. They realized that heirlooms etc. made leveling too quick, and too competitive with char level boosts. If you can 1-120 in sub-24h then why spend $60? But if it's three times that much, well, that is a different story.</div></div><hr />

In what way?<br />
<br />
The first is saying that &quot;lower speed teaches you your class better&quot; is not an argument because it doesn't, the second is saying that the real reason is they want slow leveling to make boosts more attractive.<br />
<br />
How is that a contradiction?</div></div><hr />

For a lot of specs that doesn't really help. There are certain synergies or passive abilities that are crucial in a spec's playstyle and you don't get those until much later in the leveling experience, making a certain amount of levels completely pointless in terms of teaching you how to play the class. <br />
<br />
If you play a class that has a long setup time or a somewhat complex rotation, you're not going to learn any of that killing quest mobs because they won't live long enough. Your openers, cooldown management, DoT management, resource management, execute-range rotation, etc., you won't learn any of that killing 32 wolves and 20 bandits in a row. The fights are not at a consistent enough pace to get the hang of a max level rotation, especially when you're usually missing several of the key abilities in said rotation. It just slows you down and makes it more likely you won't enjoy the experience.</div></div><hr />

That is categorically false. For years there had been tons of people complaining that leveling had been trivialized and that it lost all meaning and challenge as you could just oneshot mobs and roll through zones and dungeons.<br />
<br />
There were also tons of complaints about people outleveling zones well before finishing the questlines and being forced to move on to the next zone if they wanted to keep getting experience.<br />

They changed it because of all that feedback, and you can go back through the various Q&amp;As and panels they did over the course of Legion to see them fielding questions about it almost every time.</div></div><hr />

Because some idiots wanted slow leveling doesn't mean everyone did. You must be so naive to think that they changed it based on feedback. Only thing it did was to give they excuse.<br />
<br />
Also no one wanted heirlooms to be nerfed so they are almost useless apart from XP boost. Them nerfing leveling along with nerfing heirlooms and nerfing RAF plus they nerfed every possible way to make leveling faster (max level chars boosting you and Karazhan) only shows they are doing it on purpose for the boosts or any other reason which makes them more money.<br />
<br />
They are business not charity. <br />
<br />
If they actually cared (maybe they do but their management doesn't) then they could find middle ground. Let people level fast if they choose to. Maybe some kind of item which you get for reaching 110/120 and you can use it to boost XP 3 times on 1 character for lets say 1 week. This would make people who want to level fast happy and would also encourage people to level more characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I laugh when people say stuff like this to justify crazy conspiracy theories.<br />
<br />
Yep, they're a business. Sometimes as a business you make the most money by actually doing things the customers want. That's what convinces them to buy your stuff.<br />
<br />
Despite what you say, people have been whining for more difficult, less pointless levelling for YEARS. The 7.3 changes to levelling are absolutely a response to that feedback. The Allied Race armor sets are an incentive to try and get more people to do that new levelling, which boosts the engagement at those levels and makes it a better experience.<br />
<br />
If you wanna get cynical about it, then yeah I can totally agree that allied race armor sets are a thing because they want to make money (omg how evil for a business!) by encouraging more people to spend time in game levelling. I'm not convinced it's a BAD thing to give players an incentive to play the game more.<br />
<br />
The idea that they'd deliberately break and bug the scaling in the game to make levelling broken to try and trick people into buying boosts to skip the content though? Come on, really?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you realy hate leveling so much you can buy a boost.<br />
<br />
People tent to enjoy less and less on a game and only wanne rush to the “fun” part of the game and when rushes trough that to they start to complain there nothing to do.<br />
<br />
What every you do its never good enough for them that complaine.<br />
<br />
Maybe they need rethink them selfs is this game me? Do I even enjoy it.<br />
<br />
I for vanilla player and still playing and still like 90% of the game and that includes leveling.<br />
<br />
On the vids damn sylvanas tries to look angry and edgy it just looks stooooooopid more and longer I watch it.<br />
<br />
For people like me who have leveled about three dozens characters over the years (and got some boosts as well), there should be a different solution. Either, flatout more XP from heirlooms, or a specific veteran bonus to heirlooms which takes into account how many characters you have at a very high level (like, max level of the last expansion before they upgrade heirlooms to the current expansion, and max level of current expansion after heirloom upgrade). I belong to a group who wants fast leveling, because I have seen it all for multiple times, but I like to play different characters for different reasons (like RP, for example). And I like to replay some chunks of content, while ignoring others. Love questing in BC Nagrand or Valley of the 4 Winds in MoP, for example, don't want to set my foot into some areas anymore, like any Blackrock dungeon. Hate this place.<br />
<br />
People who want to level slower always had the option to remove heirlooms. Blizzard could also implement a switch to turn off bonus XP from heirlooms if people want to keep gear which &quot;grows up&quot; with them but don't want to get too many XP. <br />
<br />
Heirlooms provide the ideal method to separate people who like slow leveling from people who like fast leveling. Combined with scaling of zones, we could have an ideal world, where both groups get their preferred leveling experience. If they didn't have screwed up the bonus XP from heirlooms and other things.<br />
<br />
BTW, in the current leveling approach, you just cannot learn complex rotations without making leveling exhaustingly long (because on the one hand we have so many quests which require killing of more than 10 mobs, sometimes going towards 50 when quest items don't drop well, and on the other hand, we level for a long time without actually having our full set of talents and abilities). Such things are for dungeon and raid play, not for open world questing. You cannot mix both, except with occasional group quests which are to some extent problematic in leveling content. For example, in the past years, I only have done the Nagrand arena event exactly once with a &quot;proper&quot; group of players in the level range of the quest (65 before leveling revamp). In every other case, it was faster to get a max level buddy to oneshot the quest mobs than looking for a group, which might never get full enough. So... you cannot teach people complex rotations and mechanics while leveling. You need scenarios with a decent chunk of XP every time your character reaches a specific milestone, kinda like PG. Or you need to encourage people to run dungeons, which is a double-edged sword, because if you don't get it right, dungeons will become the only good way to level your character.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, rolling them so hard that I can see my brain. I think those kind of opinions come from within, you know. I mean, if you have an idea that once you find a &quot;gold mine&quot; like Blizzard did (which is not a gold mine but hell lot of work), you would think that your only interest is to pile money and pile money and do nothing else and in order to think like that, you have to be like that.<br />

Sylvanas Windrunner used to be a High Elf. That is why her eyebrows are that big.<br />

Kids are so spoiled nowadays. Nobody forces you to have 12 maxed out alts. That's not how MMOs work. I remember how in Ragnarok Online I've spent MONTHS on a private 4/4/4 server to get to upper class lvl 90. You can level up to 110 now in 2-3 weeks even if you're not playing 8 h/day.<br />

The reason for slow leveling is simple. If you remember, some time ago, they stopped reporting subscription numbers. Instead, they now only showcase time spent in-game by the players. The more hours (or days, or weeks...) people spend in-game, the &quot;better&quot; this data looks.<br />
<br />
Legion had a lot of &quot;Chance at getting a good reward (RNG) instead of reward&quot; (see paragon mounts for example). This kept some players inclined to stay subbed. Now, with BfA they are introducing heirloom armor; but it is only rewarded when leveling an allied race to max level. So, since they know a lot of people will now level new characters to get the heirloom armor for each allied race, they make it as slow as possible so that people have to spend more time in-game. More time spent in-game = better for their statistics. <br />
<br />
The fact that there are a lot of &quot;fans&quot; that defend every shit decision they make certainly helped avert the backslash these changes should have gotten.<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually enjoy the slower leveling. I've leveled up 2 alts since 7.3.5 and I'm working on a warrior right now. Got ~15 levels on it since 8.0 hit.<br />

No one cares about a shitty asian MMO. Also, ever since TBC, they made leveling faster by reducing the EXP necessary to level up as well as introducing heirlooms in Cata. Can't complain about people wanting to reach max level as quickly as possible when Blizzard kept making it faster for over a decade until now.</div></div><hr />

They have the right to voice their objections, but I don't like when I'm being spoken for or counted as, without any proof, a minority when I disagree with them.<br />
You like fast leveling? Ok. I like slower leveling. Forums are flooded with complaints right now? Of course they are. People who aren't happy with current state of things make posts, people happy with how things are do not.<br />

As I said leveling alts is an extracurricular activity, not mandatory to enjoy end-game (if you're not in a cream of the crop hardcore raiding guild).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why not let the players decide for themselves what they consider to be &quot;fun&quot;, keep heirlooms with their original stats.<br />
Give players the freedom to decide whether they want to experience the slow leveling process or walk the fast leveling path, cause they did it dozens of times before.<br />
<br />
So Blizz &quot;want player to enjoy the leveling process&quot;. But makes everything which isnt the current expansion obsolete, like nerf Artefact Weapon, Order Hall, Garrison, old loot drops etc. Also including the pruning of abilities, which is damn boring, when you have to lvl up to 50 lvls to only gain a few buttons more to press.<br />
Forcing their doctrine: &quot;end game (of the newest expansion) is the only real part of game.<br />
<br />
And they wonder why player hates leveling and want to go the faster way?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, agreed, however, people who were happy with leveling before they made it slower had zero reason to post on the forums. And if you like slower leveling, than all you had to do was put off your heirlooms and play the normal way. Instead, your choice of leveling is now forced upon everyone, even those who experienced the slogfest that leveling was a decade ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep, they're a business. Sometimes as a business you make the most money by actually doing things the customers want. That's what convinces them to buy your stuff.<br />
<br />
Despite what you say, people have been whining for more difficult, less pointless levelling for YEARS. The 7.3 changes to levelling are absolutely a response to that feedback. The Allied Race armor sets are an incentive to try and get more people to do that new levelling, which boosts the engagement at those levels and makes it a better experience.<br />
<br />
If you wanna get cynical about it, then yeah I can totally agree that allied race armor sets are a thing because they want to make money (omg how evil for a business!) by encouraging more people to spend time in game levelling. I'm not convinced it's a BAD thing to give players an incentive to play the game more.<br />
<br />
The idea that they'd deliberately break and bug the scaling in the game to make levelling broken to try and trick people into buying boosts to skip the content though? Come on, really?<br />
<br />
Who said anything about breaking and bugging scaling? I know new patches can cause random bugs and problems especially when there are big changes like this.<br />
<br />
I am talking here about pre 7.3.5 into 7.3.5 leveling changes. All of those were clearly to make leveling boring and tedious. What fun is there in killing 20 mobs 10 min just to complete few quests? There are no game-play benefits to make leveling longer. Only benefit doing it is to annoy people and force them to buy boosts. Thousand games use this basic principle to sell shit that otherwise takes ages to finish with no investment at all. If what you claim is true then they would never fix Karazhan leveling and boosting with max level chars. It wasn't even that super good, it was just a bit faster for those who wanted to do it that way.<br />
<br />
You underestimate how much money boosts are making. Even at lower paid job you can earn money for boost during 2-3 days which is worth more than 50 hours needed to level it. And all blizzard had to do was to make it long so some people will reevaluate their time and rather buy boost than wasting time.<br />
<br />
There is exactly 0 reasons to make mobs last longer. Yay I need to cast 3 fireballs to kill something, what a fun content. Now do it for 100 levels.<br />
<br />
&quot;people have been whining for more difficult, less pointless levelling for YEARS&quot; This is not a reason they changed it. They don't care about 10 people saying it should be slow. And they could make it slow just for those without heirlooms but they instead nerfed it for both.<br />

The fact that level boost costs 60 euro, which is at the same level or higher than most new games, is an obvious sign what is their purpose with making leveling what it is now.<br />
<br />
I used to enjoy leveling alts. Just leveling them to max level and making another character to level. I'm not doing that anymore. I spend less time in game, have longer breaks between my subsriptions and in no fucking way am I going to pay 60 euro for character boost. All in all, Blizzard made my play less and pay them less. Their choice as a distributor, same as mine as a customer.<br />

But people not seeing why they are doing it are fools. Blizzard is not a Red Cross Charity. They are business and will always put the money gains above all else.

It needs to be abit more exciting, feeling impactful or atleast interactive. While those with heirlooms should be able to level a lot easier (maybe a buff to the xp gain is needed as we can no longer accidentally out lvl regions) the whole process, the journey, is god awful boring. <br />
<br />
Bosses need to be more then just sit there and spank it, literially the low level bosses are extemely boring sit there and hit 1-3 buttons for a good 2-3 minutes and it dies, complete snorefest. What we need is mechanics, telegraphs, interactions with environment/levers/triggers that make the boss fight more exciting. Like off the cuff, Wailing caverns; the snake lady could have snakes pop up that trail venom in a criss cross pattern or spit in lines that are shown with telegraphs, the giant moss elemental could require you to eat mushrooms to be immune to a poison he puts out, the boss before could be you gotta knock over totems of power that constantly rebuild themselves, the murloc could be a fun take on rebounding balls of nightmare energy back to him, scum could be a silly encounter where you gotta have him ram himself into walls and drench yourself in the waterfall if he catches you on fire. I know there is some i missed but the fights need more to them. This game needs more to it from the start.<br />
<br />
We will not get new players in this game if they dont find it enjoying to level, and the whole argument of 'they want them to buy boosts' holds little water here as people wont invest money in a game that seems boring, plus do you really want 110 or 120 level players who never played past lvl 30 in your raids or groups? <br />

Basically, WoW needs a better journy to fit its destination.</div></div><hr />
