Ion being contradictory about World First?<br />
So apparently today Ion said the team loves watching the World First race. <br />
<br />
But yesterday in the Q&amp;A, Ion said that the dev team doesn't care about the World First race, so if the Battle of Dazar'alor ends up with different final bosses for each faction, it doesn't matter, and it'll be up to players to decide what &quot;World First&quot; actually matters. (And yes, I'm also aware he said that they may end up making it so all the bosses will end up the same order regardless of faction, but they aren't sure yet)<br />
<br />
I don't even care about World First, but isn't that like, seriously contradictory? You either care or you don't care about World First, but apparently Ion both cares and doesn't care about it in a 12 hour time frame of one another???<br />
We love that the community rallies around World Firsts as this is a community created thing that became so popular, but when he says that we don't care about it he's just saying that we don't design with it in mind. It's a very niche thing as well as a niche type of player. We're talking about a less than .1% of players that even set foot inside the current raid tier at Mythic level that would even be competing for these World Firsts. <br />
<br />
Like Ion said in the Q&amp;A we design encounters in the way that we feel would be the best experience. We might be wrong sometimes but that's the goal and we try to hit that.

Is it just me or have there been far, far more threads claiming to not continue their sub/cancel completely compared to all throughout Legion? Like, it's getting to a point where I'm wondering if Blizzard is worried or not. I don't want to go through another WoD debacle but I'm just personally noticing the increase in people who seemingly are done with my favorite game of all time.<br />
<br />
This is troubling, no? Blizzard do you even care?<br />
Then before that it was Legendaries in Legion, etc. The list goes on for each expansion. I remember seeing people on the forums claiming that the 1.6 patch was going to kill the game because it allowed players to queue for BGs at the Battlemasters in capital cities and thus they were unsubbing, this was 13 years ago.<br />
<br />
I don't want to diminish or invalidate anyone's criticism with this post but yes, GD has always been like this and always will. (Blue Tracker (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1102804-wow-subscribers/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769577220?page=3#56))<br />
<br />
im actually kind of sad to see this reply as it just feels inline with everything going on lately. shrug of the shoulders and oh well, btw we are making azurite more complicated, have a nice day!!. in this answer all I see is more of the same our way or the highway attitude from blizz. its disappointing.<br />
<br />
Just gotta say, despite saying you don't want to diminish or invalidate criticism, you do just that.<br />
Sorry if that was the feeling at all as like I said I don't aim to do that by any means.<br />
<br />
Even though we all know how GD can get, we by no means use that to dismiss any present feelings or overall concerns. We recognize everyone is coming from a good place when they raise a concern and every forum post does have a point. Sometimes the point is a little silly or we disagree with it, but that doesn't make it any less valid from that perspective of that player (even if they use McNuggets to explain it). Internally though we share a lot of the concerns you guys have, and conversations happen daily around them as well. We discuss what actually causes this problem and how to solve it. That includes fixing something if we feel it does need to be fixed.

<br />
There’s already something implemented that after 1 side clears their specific bosses that you can then go kill the other sides 3 bosses. Technically I would state that makes neither side actually have faction specific bosses since they are all available.<br />
Personal thoughts aside, the fact that each faction has access to all 9 bosses total has led people to think world 1st will be clearing every boss each side, not just the main faction story ones.</div></div><hr />

the huge spike in &quot;I quit&quot;, Blizz removed the survey when you cancel asking why.<br />
So people really want to give feedback why they are cancelling. <br />
Ion and the team have talked about the lack of communication putting the survey back<br />
would be a brilliant start.<br />
<br />
sorry if someone has played for 7 years cancel. and not even a short survey why they are cancelling<br />
there's little wonder they take to a forum and tell them why, Its the only means they have</div></div><hr />

You should have your head checked because that IS criticism. They wouldn't talk about how bad everything is if it wasn't in the first place. I know shocking huh? When things are bad then people bitch and complain. There's always going to be some complaining to complain but logic says when there's an abundance of threads with complaints, maybe just maybe something is wrong and it needs to be fixed. <br />

70% of the people that took that specific poll. Is there a vote count on that poll? Is it in the low hundreds or the high thousands? Either way, a couple hundred or even a few thousand people don't represent the whole of the community. They represent a couple hundred or a few thousand of the community. That's all.

<br />
Doesn't matter if you're Horde or Alliance, you still do all nine bosses in the end. The six for your faction and then you experience the other faction's side of the battle via a flashback thing.<br />

That also applies to the vocal minority of people complaining. You can't have it both ways.<br />

To whom? Personally I'm not offended by what a couple of corporate lapdogs have to say. I just disregard it because it doesn't actually mean anything. They are a couple of human beings that have the same weaknesses that most any of us have. If I had to deal with some of the halfwit fucktards that they deal with, I would probably lose my shit sometimes too.

Cool. <br />
<br />
Me, i'm just laughing at the usual ham-handed way Blizzard is handling their business. Any other company, if an employee called ANY customers &quot;douchebag&quot; or &quot;dickbag&quot;, in any context, they would be called into their supervisor's office the next day and summarily fired. It's hilarious to me that Blizzard thinks it's acceptable and professional. Yes, Lore can say what he wants on his personal Twitter, but when it's work related, then it's not personal, and any adult knows that some things, nobody needs to hear, you say that shit in private. It's not 'weakness&quot;, it's Lore being exactly what he's accusing others of being, and the irony is rich and delicious considering it's that permed poodle poseur who's saying it. <br />
<br />
Also, stop assigning emotion to me. I'm not &quot;offended&quot;, I'm not a paying customer of Blizzard's. I'm mocking them. There's a world of difference there.</div></div><hr />

If said topic isn't true it's normally ignored, when a blue posts in a thread is trying to justify it saying it's all ways been like this. Yes it's true to a point but never this bad (about subs).

I wonder if that person intentionally dodged the actual question or if he/she's incompetent to comprehend it. The person asking wasn't talking about whether or not there were instances of people criticising the game and announcing their cancelling of subscription, the person was talking about FREQUENCY of these posts compared to previous expansions. That's a pretty big and pretty relevant difference. If you're gonna act like an idiot when answering it, you might as well avoid it in the first place and not humiliate the company for hiring someone so incompetent.</div></div><hr />

The game has always had good and bad changes happen with each x-pac. It will get ironed out for the current player base eventually.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FelPlague</div><div class="date">2018-10-15, 02:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There’s already something implemented that after 1 side clears their specific bosses that you can then go kill the other sides 3 bosses. Technically I would state that makes neither side actually have faction specific bosses since they are all available.<br />
Personal thoughts aside, the fact that each faction has access to all 9 bosses total has led people to think world 1st will be clearing every boss each side, not just the main faction story ones.<br />

can you find me the source for this, i beleived this too but people have told me to find a source and i cant, all i can find is &quot;an npc will tell you what happened&quot; and i took that as you will then do the other raid as a horde/alliance</div></div><hr />

Under the INTRODUCTION part. 3 shared bosses. 3 Horde specific bosses, which are available to Alli players after completing Alli encounters via a scout, and vice Versa (paraphrasing). Actual verbage on the link.</div></div><hr />

It was the beginning of the end for WoW in terms of verisimilitude.Exactly, reading quoted part caused me to have similar thoughts on context. In fact, people were right, even if not so much for this change, but more about their “direction” turned out to be vicious... in perspective :(<br />
<br />
&quot;This is troubling, no? Blizzard do you even care?<br />
<br />
Then before that it was Legendaries in Legion, etc. The list goes on for each expansion. I remember seeing people on the forums claiming that the 1.6 patch was going to kill the game because it allowed players to queue for BGs at the Battlemasters in capital cities and thus they were unsubbing, this was 13 years ago.<br />
<br />
I don't want to diminish or invalidate anyone's criticism with this post but yes, GD has always been like this and always will. (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)&quot;<br />

This is so disapointing... they really don't give a fuck anymore.I guess they don't see irony (https://i.imgur.com/gSPNzGN.jpg) here. <br />

Legendary items remained what they were told almost about 3 years ago (https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17610981805?page=2#post-37) (even before launching) - unfortunate (https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17616512196#post-19) innovation, nothing changed since that time for current days. It’s just that community decided to reconcile with this evil, if this same story'll happened with AA (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2434882-Azerite-Armor-System-actually-is-not-that-bad?p=50227598&amp;viewfull=1#post50227598), it only remains to agree with scoffers and clever people who asserted and continue asserting that community is ready to eat everything, even if been served with “own seized organs (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gawTzolFiM4&amp;t=217s)” :p</div></div><hr />
