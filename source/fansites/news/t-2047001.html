<br />
Frostmourne was for the Man At Arms series when he was doing their forging - now taken over by Baltimore Knife and Sword. <br />
<br />
For WoD though he was contracted to do Gorehowl though, made a pretty damned epic one. I'd really like to see them hire him to do most if not all of the artifact weapons. Would be fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the original doomhammer has already been made in the past.<br />
<br />
Like he said, going another way would have led to it being way WAY too heavy given its design and proportions.<br />
<br />
its an impractical fantasy weapon. to create it in real life some concessions need to be made.<br />

I can't imagine all of that is real. They had to add a bunch of sparks and crap in editing to give it that wow factor. I have never had that much sparking when tigging. Especially for like 5 seconds after the weld! at 2:27</div></div><hr />

<br />
*sigh* The proportions are on point, some of it has to be lost in translation when being made in real life because it will be unwieldable otherwise. The fact he needed extra metal strips to hold it together while the other one only had 2-3 was already indicative of that fact.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much actually. Not sure if competing with dungeoneering/questing, but the a complete invasion gave more than half a level at 53.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well how ive seen the thing. shrink the hammer head a little. shorten the handle and thicken it a bit<br />
<br />
https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/6020045/doomhammer-replica-now-on-sale ya their replica isnt &quot;orc&quot; size standards but the one they made looks to big to be wielded 1 handed even by an orc<br />
<br />
its suppose to be big enough that if need be you can swing it with 2 hands but to be prominently a 1 handed weapon like the bastard sword</div></div><hr />

It scales depending on your level. Below 20, you gain a level per invasion STAGE. Above 60 it drops significantly.</div></div><hr />

actually during the large scale invasion stage, you can gather more xp than you earn from the stage end bonus by soloing the small mobs that spawn around.</div></div><hr />

Those are probably good for the lower levels I guess? But at 85+ the xp from those seem really low</div></div><hr />

It's honestly better to have it silent while they figure out an alternative for the old sound. Because that got old incredibly fast.</div></div><hr />

I didn't mind the fact that it's a whistle. It's just that it's the same whistle over and over again. Don't they have the ability to cycle sound effects? Just different variations of a whistle would be enough to kill it's &quot;annoying&quot; factor, at least for me.</div></div><hr />
