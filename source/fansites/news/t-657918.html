Patch 3.2 PTR Notes Update - Quest Tracking feature removed<br />
The Patch 3.2 Notes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=866) have been updated and it seems that the built-in Questhelper has been removed from the patch. In the current state of the PTRs, some of the quests have their objectives displayed properly on the map but for most of them they just point to a random map location in Hillsbrad. <br />

<br />
Design Q&amp;A with Ghostcrawler<br />
<br />
Question #1: Pure VS Hybrid DPS - I think the community as a whole understands and accepts the fact pure DPS classes need to do the most damage due to the inflexibility of their roles. My question is there is a large gap between certain hybrids and their counterparts in other specs. Currently, DK's and Feral cats compete almost, but not quite, with the pure dps classes. In no particular order, priests, moonkins, ret paladins, shamans, warriors lag significantly behind, or, at least currently in 3.1. I know you have taken steps to curb feral DPS, and you have removed some of the &quot;Splash&quot; damage of DK AoE, but is it your intent to bring DKs/Feral cats DOWN to the other hybrids, or bring the other hybrids UP closer to the to their kitty/death knight counterparts? <br />
<br />
DK and Feral dps should both be lower in 3.2 compared to 3.1. A few other specs received slight buffs, but overall we're pretty happy with the PvE dps balance. You have to look at a lot of different boss fights and break the data down in different and relatively complex ways before you can really stack rank damage done with any kind of authority. As soon as we add a new boss, it's all going to change anyway. Nobody's dps seems so low that it's a liability to bring them. The few damage-oriented specs that are low in PvE have alternative specs in other trees that work out fine. It's always going to be the kind of thing we tweak a lot -- it's a process not a destination. <br />
<br />
Question #2 Caster DPS VS Melee DPS in PvP: - Even the most jaded of melee classes will admit ( I hope) they are dominating in PvP, which the possible exception of frost mages. In this author's view, it is because mages have the ability, much more so then any other class, to &quot;open the gap&quot; and prevent the melees from making contact. I've seen from your previous responses you don't want to have every other class have warmed over or simply reprinted mage skills, and I know I personally agree with you. But I think it's fair to say a little tweaking needs to be done to the casting dps classes, specifically, to make them not want to pound their desks in frustration. I know you don't want to give everyone Frost Nova, but it seems casters, from warlocks to shadowpriests to moonkins, desperately need a way to get out of the speeding truck we call melee. <br />
<br />
This is a really large topic that's beyond the scope of a brief answer here. In general I think the &quot;melee owns casters&quot; mantra is too simplistic. As you point out, Frost mages generally do well in 3s and Enhancement shamans are not generally feared to the degree rogues and DKS might be, so you already have to caveat it a lot. <br />
<br />
Question #3 Spellpower Plate - I'd have to say a good 80% of the people who raid WoW are really, really sick of spellpower plate dropping in raids. When SP plate drops one spec of one class can use this, which means you have 29 out of 30 disappointed specs. God forbid two pieces of spell power plate drop from the same boss. The oft-suggested and effective fix would probably have a passive talent trainable by Paladins to convert Attack Power into Spellpower. I realize this would take some rebalancing of Paladins, ensuring Holy Paladins had mana(converted from Strength?) and roughly equivalent spellpower to heal. The talents Sheath of Light and Guided by the Light would probably need to be adjusted and maybe those spots in the talent trees might be a good place, and this is just me brainstorming, to have prot paladins run a little faster (they hardly need more threat or another tanking CD, come 3.2) and give Ret paladins an interrupt that they do honestly need. <br />
<br />
We would like to get rid of spellpower plate, but we don't have a great system yet to make loot work without it. We want Holy paladins to wear plate and we don't want them to be great at say damage or tanking without having to swap gear. <br />
<br />
Question #4: Tri Specs - Give us an inch, we'll ask for a mile. Now that we've had a taste of the sweet life of dual specs, we realize how useful it is. And, for this we thank you. But I know there are classes who would like to experiment with the last tree of their class, or perhaps build a pure pvp spec without the not-quite compromise of the guild who require their hybrids to have both specs PvE optimized for raiding. I don't really think this would totally break your raid style encounters, do you? Any word on this? <br />
<br />
Talent spec is still supposed to be meaningful. We don't want characters to be swapping through talent specs the way they do gear sets in Equipment Manager or your favorite mod. The Dual-spec feature was intended to make it easier to flip between two commonly-used specs. It wasn't supposed to make spec not a commitment. It will be a long time, if ever, before we take this to more than 2 specs. <br />
<br />
Question #5 - My fifth and final question is about haste scal...just kidding. I don't I would be far wrong in saying the community as a whole would really like something to do with our achievement points. This would also make good business sense for you if you set the bar steep enough. Something unique in game, such as our names written in gold or perhaps a master ( in my case) priest class tag. Perhaps a passenger mount that flies or a 2nd hearthstone location. Something to do with our hard won achievement points I think would be a fun addition to the game. <br />
<br />
Achievements are not intended to improve player power. They are supposed to be a totally optional path to achievement. Even though they don't improve player power, they are still enormously popular, so we don't think we need to do anything to make them more enticing. Other games may use their achievements as a form of character progression, but we think we've got that covered already with things like character level, gear progression, reputations, etc. The 310% speed mounts were an exception, but they've also been an extremely controversial and problematic exception and I'm not sure we'd handle that the same way if we could do it all again.<br />
<br />
We will continue to explore &quot;vanity&quot; or &quot;prestige&quot; rewards that don't inflate character power. We still wouldn't require you to spend points as a form of currency though. Generally, except for tweaks we make to the system, achievement points should only go up.</div></div><hr />

In 25 man often between 3-5. If every pala took ap/str gear. That would mean around 6-8 in a normal grp set up. That would not be balanced. 2. This would make palas pretty Op if they could heal as a Holy Pala and dps like a retri without switching gear.

Werent they more talking about increasing Warrior dmg in Prot spec since it falls short against the dmg Paladins, Druids and DKs tanks do (Dont have much past expirience from DK tanks though) This was mentioned somewhere in the Warrior Q&amp;A i think.<br />
<br />
I would still love to have some more regular AoE threath builder since thats one area where we fall short or its made considerably harder for us than let say Druids and Paladins.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're JUST hearing about this now? They've had this particular feature in the PTR for about a week or two already. And as for the &quot;ZOMG it's all casual gamers now!!&quot; mindset, Blizzard has been trying for a couple years now to get things people use addons for that are popular into the game itself so they don't have to run with tons of addons (and possibly get teh dreaded keylogger that only really happens if you don't pay attention). They did it with Scrolling Combat Text, they did it with Outfitter/Closet Gnome, and they're also now doing it with Carbonite/QuestHelper.<br />
<br />
Honestly I was cheering for this inclusion to hit with 3.2. QH has a horridly large footprint, and I'm a person who will never pay for an addon (donations are fine if I like the addon enough, but outright paying for it? NO), so seeing Blizzard tackle the situation made me quite happy. Heck, I was already gearing up to delete my QH folder and use the WoW version if it was good enough...</div></div><hr />

I don't like the idead of letting holy paladins scale of melee stats. An easy &amp; simple solution would be to remove spell plate and let them roll on spell mail. As a compensation for the loss of armor they could tweak one of the talents further down the tree (so it can't be reached by prot or retri) to improve armor (&quot;increases the armor benefit from mail items by 50%&quot;, &quot;increases armor by 300% of your intellect&quot;, ...).<br />

Someone has to be last, you know.<br />

About the quest stuff, yeah indeed I doubt they're removing it altogether. Probably just delayed, or maybe just an error. I can't imagine them making such a (rather big) UI feature only to ditch it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't even have to do it through talents. As we have already seen with the BoA shoulders, they can easily make mail/plate shoulders that are different armor levels to different classes. Simply convert all the mail/plate spell power gear into this hybrid gear and you have made all that currently plate gear useful to shamans, and the (currently) mail becomes less frowned upon for paladins. In addition, no talents need to be changed to make up for it: no talent issues can arise now or in the future.<br />
<br />
Frankly, the strength/AP conversion to spell power &amp; mana sucks nuts. There is no way to balance it against the massive dps boost healadins would gain without being a headache for prot and ret spec design.<br />

I already thought you were full of $hit before you made this statement - most retarded thing I've ever read. But 9k and 13k TPS as a Warrior....not hardly. Warrior TPS&lt;Druid, Pally, DK TPS. Sad though that people feel the need to make up big numbers.<br />

As for their built in Questhelper - I won't be switching to it. Every built in feature Blizzard has added to &quot;replace&quot; an existing add-on has sucked. Itemrack/Outfitter, Omen, SCT etc are all still better than their WoW counterparts. And every intelligent guild still uses Ventrilo. It's almost 2010, everyone should have a computer capable of running many, many add-ons.<br />

<br />
i rater they buff warrs hp or avodens witch it really low compared to other tanking classes end game (and they can eze the nerf on DK a tad aswell)<br />
BTW i pull the most threat of all the tanks in my guild even tho the paladin tank has better wep and shield than me<br />
<br />
Idk why i doubt this, but you ever think that the prot pally guildie is just terribad, and you pulling the most threat of any tank as a War? If its true maybe its your entire guild thats bad.....<br />
<br />
Just something to think 'bout<br />

As we have already seen with the BoA shoulders, they can easily make mail/plate shoulders that are different armor levels to different classes. <br />
<br />
<br />
That's a great idea.<br />
<br />
Blizzard won't implement it because it would mean that people could potentially get meaningful upgrades every run and they've stated on numerous occasions that that's not part of their loot design.<br />
<br />
Frankly, if they'd add more spell mail that would be sweet, but then it would probably mean that Elemental shaman would have to fight with the Holy Pallys for it since their gear blows, and ours has the stats they want/need.<br />
<br />
Rotten design in my (not so) humble opinion.<br />
<br />
@kfrost2008: Why do you think it is removed permanantly? The Equipment Manager was removed and then fixed and added in later. I bet this is the same.</div></div><hr />

It's not getting permanently removed, they are just delaying it for a next (minor) patch until they iron out all the bugs. They have done this before with the equipment manager already.</div></div><hr />

What makes you think they'd remove that feature, though? As far as I can tell, they're supposedly only reverting the whole map waypoints thingy. Even though I doubt that's final (or even true).</div></div><hr />

On the PTR we are nowhere near the power house we were for raw damage, now though we are falling away so I think an interrupt even if it's on a 15-20s cd with 2-3s lock-out it would be nice. We still have our utility, that might be all we need, I hope.</div></div><hr />

So fed up that Hybrids can't be on the same line as Pure, and I play a Rogue.<br />
<br />
That and he totally negated the Melee PVP Truck. Rogue vs anything cept pally's and I own. Yet when I'm on my Mage, and my friend on his, we can't keep anything melee away long enough to do real damage. Death Grip is OP when they can strangulate / chains of ice spam you along with a damn pet that can stun you. Pally's just eat anyone so IDC in that aspect. (Thank you blizz for their nerfs.) Warriors Spamstring you, Charge here, Charge there. Rogues just stunlock to hell.<br />
<br />
My Ele shaman friend says the same thing, even though he has earth-grasp totem (talent) when though he has stoneclaw shield, and IMP GW, melee own him to hell.<br />
And with the resilence change, you won't be able to kill healers now. That or them healing someone else too. Retarded move Blizz.</div></div><hr />

http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=18600874039&amp;sid=1 &lt;- Original post. <br />
<br />
On the interrupt for Paladins: I believe they need one as well, at least only usable on the PvE side. I understand why people don't feel the need for Paladins to have them as far as PvP goes, but to a Prot Paladin, with almost no ways to interrupt casting, it's not so great. I have to have outside sources brought in to help on bosses since I can't interrupt, this is especially hard at Iron Council while doing hard mode. We really do need an interrupt. <br />
<br />
Spell Power plate: I agree with this one as well, my off spec is Holy, and sometimes I have better gear for my off spec than my Prot main, just because of the abundance of Holy plate that drops. The Retribution tree has a talent that works similar to what the OP suggested in another post if you read the original, and it was also suggested (if the talented conversion didn't go through) to have plate drop haste and crit, so even if it's not as usable to a melee plate wearer, it could still be rolled as a temporary upgrade on other plate wearing specs. <br />
<br />
Melee vs Casters in PvP: This has been discussed since the dawn of time, there's never been a fix to it, and probably won't be anytime in the near future. <br />
<br />
Hybrid vs Pure DPS: This has pretty much already been solved. DKs have right around the same amount of damage other hybrids do, Cats didn't get nerfed so much as they got fixes, so I think for the most part GC is right about this one. <br />
<br />
Alright, this post is a bit too long. <br />
<br />
TL:DR <br />
No dodging was made by Blizzard, this was a person's post, not actual Q&amp;A. Some of the suggestions made were pretty good, some are already being done in 3.2.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) They know that for example moonkin dps is very low in comparison because of the RNG nature of Ulduar and the RNG nature of Eclipse. If everything falls right moonkin does ok, but start moving and it becomes horrible. Mages have done well because they can blink to a safe spot and restart dps or run out and blink back in, etc... DoT locks have done well because it's their main damage and as thus doesn't require cast times.<br />
<br />
2) pvp, basically he didn't say anything.</div></div><hr />

Changing for the sake of it is not very wise. Rogues are pulling 6-7k dps in raids. Offer a lot &quot;services&quot; on a raid setting. &quot;If it is not broken don't fix it&quot;?</div></div><hr />
