<br />
It's probably due to people being less able to get into TB games compared to WG games back in Wrath due to the 1:1 enforced player ratio. It'd probably take years or even a lifetime to get 100 wins if you're playing on a realm like Mal'Ganis on Horde side.<br />

It is also possible that it is like this now, and it is yet another tooltip update.on the negative side, this just makes it even harder for restro to dps. Many other classes get a 10% bonus to their spec's spells, making the difference between damage while inside and outside of the spec not as large.</div></div><hr />

They're good for e-peen healing in PvP though. The new Mysterious Potion buff would equal some sick self-healing if you're a Blood DK:<br />
<br />
50000 = Maximum amount of Base Healing<br />
*1.4 = 70000, with Glyphed Vampiric Blood active<br />
*1.4 = 98000, with an Alchemist Stone equipped<br />
*1.5 = 147000, assuming Crit heals with Potions have a 1.5 multiplier<br />
OR *2.0 = 196000, assuming a Crit 2.0 multiplier<br />
<br />
You probably won't be seeing those numbers unless all the stars align perfectly though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because in WotLK it was easier to get 100 wins in WG, because more people played with it and it was more fun.<br />
Most of the people doesn't like TB, but love(d) WG. Usually on my realm there's about 20 vs 20 in TB in the afternoon, in WG it was about 100 vs. 100 and everyone had awful lag...but WG was fun anyway.(later it wasn't possible so many people join the battle if I'm right)</div></div><hr />

Well if that was true, wouldn't it be better to fix it another way? I mean a quarter of a lifetime is still hell of a time to spend on an achiev... Exaggeration aside, wouldn't it be better to come back to the WG model and just improve upon it instead of nerfing the achievement?</div></div><hr />

I was kind of lucky though, after the first couple of week, our faction won TB around 80% of the time and the alliance out numbered us 3:2, so we rarely missed a queue. The only times we really lost were in the dead of night and early morning where we actually were outnumbered in TB due to not having the 5 person minimum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agree... I got that achievement 2 months ago and it's really hard work... I feel like I wasted my time and effort on it. It's just unfair. They should at least scale it up like 50 Victories (10 points) and 100 Victories (10 points) like they use to.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These are the type of comments that need to be kept to yourself. Constructive feedback is accepted, however - saying that a certain class or spec (especially one that has had major issues with balance due to quick-fixes from Blizzard.. ie; Tier Bonus) is not requiring buffs - is downright childish.<br />
Please backup your statement with evidence, rather than just ranting on about how &quot;buffing elemental is not needed&quot;. It's people like you that contaminate the WoW forums with garbage posts.<br />
I for one look forward to these changes, and am interested to see how this MINOR buff will result in bringing the Elemental spec up on par with the rest of the caster specs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OK so it seems like for someone like you been 24/7 online and queuing everytime isnt's a big deal.<br />
<br />
Let's think for a while... 2-2h30 waiting for a match. 15-30min per match.<br />
<br />
Winning 100 matches means 100x 15-30min and waiting for the in queue every 2-2h30.<br />
In the best of scenarios: Playing (and winning) all 100 matches = 1500-3000min. Thats 25-50 hours non stop non sleep no bathroom no work no food (alright, maybe a drink). But hey, we're just counting the matches hours. Not the queue ones... Oh! The queue... let's talk about queue... you may queue, wait, and you might not get in, you know? If you dont get in, thats another 2-2h30 waiting... wasted.<br />
<br />
Now the IFS:<br />
IF YOU GET IN, then you have a chance to get credit (1/100)... but thats only... IF YOU WIN. But then again you'll lose IF YOU HAVE A BAD TEAM.</div></div><hr />

The problem with the TB achi is that its so server dependent, it could be kinda easy to do as alliance on one server but completly inpssoiuble to do it as horde on the same and vice versa. Just look at it this way, lets say you server has 75% horde and 25% ally (not that uncommon) and that u always win an offensive battle, then it would take the alliance guy about 200 TB battle to get the achi if u now get in in almost everyone, while at the same time would take the horde guy 600 battle just because he's unlucky and play on a server where there is more horde and more ppl that queue. So they had to fix it to actually make it possible for some ppl to achive. The other achi wont suffer the same way because youcould chain queue WSG etc.<br />
<br />
About the ele buffs, pretty much takes us back to where we where in t12. Yes our t set t12 will be crap and we lose alot of dps on it, but as soon as we replace it with t13 will that dps lose be way smaller and we will be back in the middle pack of dpser.</div></div><hr />

At least in my experience it was. I've found Tol Barad simply isn't ran very often across the 3 servers I have toons on. 25 does seem a little low though, 50 seems a bit more reasonable. But Tol Barad was a colossol failure overall lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We, balance druids, are getting the worst 4t13<br />
Flash News: We have to cast one starsurge while in lunar eclipse, and we don't cast it in pre-solar because its damages sucks after all the ners we have received. That stupid spell doesn't even provide a reasonable amount of energy while not in eclipse to be even woth to be casted.<br />
With 4t12 we cast a starsurge every ¬11sec (considering the procs from Shooting Stars).<br />
With 4t13 we will cast a starsurge every ¬9sec.....this is barely a buff, epsecially compared to other classes' set bonuses<br />
<br />
We can't top methers in single target fights if we can't cheat by dotting something else that doesn't need to be dotted<br />
You said it's fine that way because we are hybrid and pures should do their job better...fine....We were renowned for our AoE capabilities.<br />
Well....We will sucks in aoe fights because fire mages after all the buss to every spell (especially 100% more dot damages from Pyroblast!) are doing much more damages than us with their stupid one button Combustion<br />
<br />
Talking about aoe damages...we have the clunkiest aoe in the whole game...our mushrooms waste 3 gcd for a 10sec cooldown ability and we have to waste 3 gcd to reposition them if the tank moves more than 6 fuckin yards.<br />
<br />
What we got is a new graphic for hurricane, the less used spell in every fight<br />
and a new animation for Wrath, one of the most casted spells during a fight...to bad that we have to give up the impact sound/animation.<br />
Yet you haven't found time to draw a concept art for a new moonkin form in SIX years<br />
<br />
Shamans lost 2t12 and got buffs to all their main nukes, and they benefit from that buff 100% of the time because they can keep casting while moving..Balance druids what are going to get to change eclipse faster ????? And what are we going to get to not destroy our poor single target dps every time a fight asks us to move and forbids us from casting our low dmg wrath / starsurge / looong cast time starfire ??<br />
<br />
What about pvp fixes ? there are more Beast Mastery hunters than balance druids in PvP...but you showed us we will be fine in pvp.<br />
in MISTS OF PANDARIA, Why the fuck should i pay 50$ to have my class fixed in pvp ? I'm a paying customer exactly like mages and dks and rogues.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, don't forget to nerf the rogue legendary weapon because it is riddicolous that it increase sinister strike damages by 45% + the legendary proc.<br />
It's like having 50% crit chance as a rogue. I don't thinnk that Dragonwrath has an effect that increase the main nuke of the wieleder bu 45% + the legenday proc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It increases SS dmg because daggers have a lower AP coefficient for instant attacks than other 1h's do. It just allows combat rogues to actually use the daggers instead of being forced into another spec.<br />
<br />
The proc + the 10% AP buff will probably make rogues OP though.</div></div><hr />

Ok, so, we all could argue that battlegroup X has a terrible time doing WSG (actually, my battleground is just like that, we got roflstomp in there so many times that I'm totally ok with now with my objective of 1 victory per week, lol) all day and that WSG achiev should be nerfed even with chain queue.<br />
<br />
WG was worse, nothing changed. Why was it worse? Because it started with no limit, then near the end, they implemented the player limit, so everyone who still needed their victories to get to 100 got screwed since now you have a lot of ppl trying it, but only a few slots to fill. I've been there, I know how I felt when I had to deal with that on top of the alread problematic 100 victories. Now imagine you finishing the achievement even with player limit and less ppl on your faction side, just to get it chopped to 25 2 weeks laters, that's TB. Great.<br />
<br />
As someone pointed out, it's a &quot;useless&quot; achievement. So no need to change it? If you're trying to finish it, you know what you're going up to, it's like farming the BG reps... I could just think about myself and say I would love some kind of nerf on those. Like the TB achievement, I know what I'm going to face if I decide to go for it.<br />
<br />
So, yes, I really feel it like a nice /slap or /spit in the face of a lot of their players, myself included since I finally finished it 1 week ago. &quot;Há! Take that losers!&quot;. Changing it later in MoP... still not that nice, but we can all say &quot;ok...&quot;, but still in the middle of the TB own expansion... /spit /slap in the face. My time is not worth anything in Blizzard's opinion.<br />
<br />
Should at least go to FoS section in my opinion for all the trouble they caused. You can't be Master of Tol Barad if someone else is &quot;more veteran&quot; than you, lol. Inconsistency. When you see &quot;Veteran of&quot; achievement, you know it's 100 victories... now I guess you don't anymore :)<br />
<br />
In MoP, if we ever get another place like that, should I go for the achievement or just wait to see if they feel like nerfing it? If they don't, I'm screwed for waiting til the end of the xpac to try the 100. Does not make sense any other new veteran achievement asking for 100 victories again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Effudin</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This nerf of TB is overdoing it in my opinion.If we say the next patch comes in November/December, then it has had approximately 50 weeks since launch. Then 25 more weeks before the expansion, then it will be 75 weeks in total for this expansion. So nerfing it to 25 wins means that it is an achievement to log in every 3rd week and win TB. I think it should be doable to at least win TB once every week, since there is approximately 60-67 battles each week depending on server downtime.I don't mind it being nerfed to 75 though, since that is one win every week, which would be doable for anyone just wanting to go BH each week.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree and may I add one more thing? People who approve this are just lazy. If it's just an achievement for you then simply don't do it. It's not like you gonna die if you don't have it. But for us, avid for achievements, this is really annoying. Waste of time we could be working on some other achievement we still don't have.</div></div><hr />

Here's how it works. Basically, the 1:1 forced ratio means that both sides must have an equal number of people in Tol Barad games. Let's say that you're realm has a 20:1 Horde:Alliance ratio, or a population of 20,000 Horde to 1,000 Alliance. The certain number of Horde queuing will probably MUCH more than the number of Alliance queueing, making the Alliance queuing population the limiting factor. So basically let's say 5 Alliance guys, or 0.5% of the population get in, so only 5 Horde guys, or 0.025% of the population, can get in because of the 1:1 rule.<br />
<br />
In other words, if you're on the more-populated faction of an imbalanced server, your chances of even getting into TB games is much less compared to the other faction. The chances worsen the more unbalanced a realm is.</div></div><hr />

So in other words when a realm population is grossly skewed in favour of one faction, that faction suffers as a result? In my book anything that encourages faction imbalances on a realm to rectify themselves is a good thing.</div></div><hr />

People who approve this are just lazy. If it's just an achievement for you then simply don't do it. It's not like you gonna die if you don't have it. But for us, avid for achievements, this is really annoying. Waste of time we could be working on some other achievement we still don't have.<br />
<br />
Not only that, but actually anything else away from the PC instead of trying to enter as many battles as possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
what? <br />
<br />
totems aint buffs? <br />
pushback aint ultility?<br />
grounding totem aint defensive?<br />
spiritwalkers grace aint mobility? <br />
<br />
only thing they need is a minor buff like the 4% here. they're not top but not bottom either. and what you see on simcrafts is not ever going to be brought to life unless you raid top 5 raiding guilds in the world. and even they have a hard time to do that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Halsynd</div><div class="date">2011-11-04, 03:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">OK so it seems like for someone like you been 24/7 online and queuing everytime isnt's a big deal.<br />
<br />
Let's think for a while... 2-2h30 waiting for a match. 15-30min per match.<br />
<br />
Winning 100 matches means 100x 15-30min and waiting for the in queue every 2-2h30.<br />
In the best of scenarios: Playing (and winning) all 100 matches = 1500-3000min. Thats 25-50 hours non stop non sleep no bathroom no work no food (alright, maybe a drink). But hey, we're just counting the matches hours. Not the queue ones... Oh! The queue... let's talk about queue... you may queue, wait, and you might not get in, you know? If you dont get in, thats another 2-2h30 waiting... wasted.<br />
<br />
Now the IFS:<br />
IF YOU GET IN, then you have a chance to get credit (1/100)... but thats only... IF YOU WIN. But then again you'll lose IF YOU HAVE A BAD TEAM.<br />
<br />
So.... where's the &quot;hard&quot; part in there, where's this &quot;hard work&quot; come from? Anyone who went out of their way to get that achiev (An achievement that gives absolutely no reward) needs to recheck their priorities, that achievement is nothing more than an e-peen stroker, and a very, very small one at that. It's time consuming because of the RNG of getting in and winning but nothing more.<br />
<br />
If it came with a sweet title or vanity item, sure, maybe, but for nothing? come on...</div></div><hr />

Going down to 25 from 100 is just throwing a bone for people who like achievements but hate PVP which is just wrong. 25 is a weak number.</div></div><hr />

this^ <br />
<br />
seems that once a faction begins to outnumber the other on a server, it DRASTICALLY worsens, now those who tried to take advantage are now suffering...i say leave it as is, force the population to even themselves out, penalize the overgrown faction enough you wont have to wait for blizz to step in with a FCM to fix a problem</div></div><hr />

Ok, so let's change the &quot;Hard work&quot; term. Put &quot;effort&quot; instead. But a +50h it's still work, no?<br />
Yes it's time consuming and thats exactly the point. You depend on your team to win a match, don't you? And you can't rely on a good team for every match, since it's a queue and you can't control who's in and who's out. You may get a full pvp arena geared and skilled team or some nub undergeared who turned 85 &quot;yesterday&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yes, no title, no vanity item, nothing. Just a pure achievement. And that's what we're after. Achievements that takes time and effort to get. The kind of achievement that you won't get in a day or 2 just because you &quot;feel&quot; like it or as &quot;consequence&quot; of playing a few pvp matches. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

Eww, i'm personally leaning the other way, but still hoping another solution could present itself.</div></div><hr />
