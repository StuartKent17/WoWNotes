<br />
Timewalking Reward Costs<br />
They already tweeted a pretty stand-pat stance about this. Their claim is it's &quot;meant to take dedication&quot;. I'm not expecting any type of change until after BlizzCon at the earliest.<br />
One of the problems with Twitter as a medium is the lack of space for nuance. There are hundreds of mounts in WoW, and they are obtainable by a wide variety of different means. Some are simple to get, and cheaply bought off vendors; some require great feats of skill like Gladiator and current Mythic raid mounts; some require tremendous luck (e.g. the Elegon mount); and some require long-term effort (e.g. the Violet Proto-Drake from A Long Strange Trip, or Darkmoon Faire prizes). <br />
<br />
Ultimately they are all cosmetic rewards, and Timewalking is designed to be an evergreen system that we will be expanding over the years. Unlike, say, a Tanaan rep mount that clearly was designed to be earned within the scope of this patch, there will be people doing Timewalking (especially as more dungeons, and more expansions' content get added) throughout the future of WoW, and this represents a long-term goal within that framework. <br />
<br />
If you want to rush through dozens of Timewalking dungeons in a short timeframe to be one of the first to get the mount, and you'd find that experience satisfying, then by all means do so. But I certainly wouldn't say that's the intended approach here. The 500-Badge quest turn-in is a once-per-event thing (which we definitely could have made clearer), so if you want to take a more measured pace and just do the Timewalking quest each time the event comes around while you happen to otherwise actively be playing, you can get the mount with just a few total hours spent (though over a longer period of real time). It's up to you. In the meantime, there are other items (notably some great alt catch-up gear) available through the system, and those are much more attainably priced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Accolade Trinkets and PvP Gearing<br />
We do not plan to put the random-stat Accolade trinkets on the vendors.<br />
<br />
However, we did uncover a bug that was causing them to provide twice the secondary stat bonus than was intended. That bug was corrected in patch 6.2.2.<br />
<br />
Frankly (speaking for myself as a player, and not for the development team), I'm not convinced that the Accolade trinkets are all they're cracked up to be.<br />
<br />
The Wild Gladiator's Accolade of Dominance provides 403 Intellect and 403 Versatility in PvP combat. The Insignia provides 469 Versatility and a 20-second 1330 Intellect proc. In sustained combat, it tends to proc around every 60 seconds, giving it roughly a 33% uptime for an average benefit of ~440 Intellect.<br />
<br />
Combine that with the fact that you have to actually be damaging someone for it to proc (which increases the effective uptime by cutting out sections where you're not hitting anyone) and the increased burst potential by allowing you to use your hardest-hitting abilities while it's active... and I'd argue that for the vast majority of players the proc trinket is easily better.<br />
<br />
Granted, you might want a different secondary stat which isn't available on the Insignia. In that case I would argue that the difference between 469 Versatility and, lets say, 403 Mastery would be EXTREMELY minor at best.<br />
<br />
I could also see an argument for those who are playing Humans, in which case you'd likely be comparing the Accolades to the Badges (the on-use trinkets) instead of the Insignias. As you can probably imagine, buffing Humans isn't exactly high on our priority list at the moment.<br />
<br />
All that said, I won't pretend for a second that I'm the best Arena player, and these are obviously just my personal opinions. I'm just not seeing what makes the Accolade trinkets so incredibly attractive that they're absolutely mandatory to the point that it's worth doing content you don't enjoy for a chance to get hold of one.<br />
<br />
I'm not really defending RNG PvP gearing, and I think the actions the development team has taken since 6.2 released speak pretty well to say that the devs aren't happy with the way it worked initially either. And I totally understand why it's frustrating that those actions aren't extending to the Accolade trinkets. All I'm saying is that, if you really don't like Ashran, just don't do it. There are other trinket options, and they're -- at worst -- still pretty good.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I should also mention again that I'm really only speaking on behalf of myself and the way I enjoy the game. Just trying to have a conversation here. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
If you talk about &quot;bad people on the internet&quot;, what kind of people do you refer to? Those who are critical? Those who threaten?<br />
Those who cross a line. No one minds critique. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/637421625311232000))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Hey GC, got any thoughts on Health of the Game vs Player enjoyment? I always feel bad about Cata heroic difficulty caving.<br />
I could write volumes on this. Players respect sticking by your guns to an extent, but at some point it becomes out of touch. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/636962886250721281))<br />
<br />
Developer Communication<br />
Is there substantial data to suggest that dev/player communication results in higher sales and retention?<br />
No, I don't believe so, which is why it is so controversial inside studios, e.g. Valve doesn't seem to value it much. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/636963509864009728))<br />
<br />
miss the dev watercooler that blizz did to keep peeps informed. was concise and it came from one source. was that your idea?<br />
I can't recall. I worked on it a lot with Bashiok and Zarhym. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/636901216291651584))<br />
Do you remember how many hours of discussion, drafting, revision and review went into each one, on average?<br />
I tend to write very fast, which is why I can do all of this. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/636963066811252736))<br />
A blog might take 2 hours depending on topic. No idea on editing. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/636963127502897152))<br />

Poll - What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been<br />
The post covering rewards talked about the What a Long, Strange Trip It's Been (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/2144-what-a-long-strange-trip-its-been) achievement and mount, so we decided to see how active players are doing towards obtaining the Violet Proto-Drake (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/60024-violet-proto-drake). Only 15.8% of players have earned the achievement! Have you completed the achievement yet? <br />

I saw it wasnt, but i was really bored with wow that week. I remember how often wow players would put in a ticket and get 1-7 days &quot;just to experience this event before it goes&quot; or &quot;To buy a game token&quot;<br />
<br />
So i sent a ticket asking if i could get 1 or 2 days gametime so i can have time to see if the game works on my computer, and how well it does. Because IF it does i was going to go ahead and buy a month just for the hell of it. I.E i was offering to give them money.<br />
<br />
The reply said that they USED to have a 10 day free trial which isnt available anymore and that they are hoping to go FTP soon.<br />

<br />
Nah, achievements hit live on 10/14/08, at least in the US. I remember that very clearly. (That is a month before Wrath launched.) I just checked and Brewfest that year ended on 10/6/08 (according to the in-game calendar). So having the mount by Midsummer was not possible. I could've sworn I remembered Brewfest still going on, but I guess not. I guess what I was thinking is that since Brew of the Year used to be required for the meta, only people who bought that thing during Brewfest 08 could finish in 09. But then it was removed from the meta. (Which is good for me, because I would've missed out.)</div></div><hr />

If Timewalking is going to be a staple in WoW for at least the next expansion than 5000 badges is a fine amount as far as I am concerned.<br />
<br />
I am on board with most people when it comes to &quot;What a Long Strange Trip Its Been&quot; because of the PvP element. I left that part out for years (either by choice or just somehow not playing in May I guess) but its not too bad. I completed the Hard Knocks achieve in an afternoon. Maybe I was lucky, who knows.

<br />
So good. I got my 310 flying from the 10 man Tier 7 achievement, which I guess was the only tier whose reward was taken away when the tier was no longer relevant. <br />
<br />
I like the entitlement that players have for rewards like this. Some players insist that all rewards be given to them with no effort and no time invested, yet I would wager these are the same players who complain about a lack of content. Guess what makes content last longer? Making it take longer! That's why Vanilla/TBC content seemed to last forever. Not only were there no catch up mechanics (well, there were in TBC, but not as extreme as today), but everything took AGES to complete. <br />
<br />
Players seem to want to have their cake and eat it too. They want an unlimited amount of content that they can never finish, while simultaneously being rewarded consistently for doing that content. But these two things are mutually exclusive. Either you have a sandbox game where the &quot;content&quot; is player created through events, the economy, etc. or you have a theme park game where you get rewarded for developer-created content, though it is exhaustible. It takes developers months to make content that can be trounced in days. Not only that, but the content has to be balanced, bug-free, fun, new, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have tried a number of year to get the School of Hard Knocks part of Children's Week, but sadly it the only achievement I need for the meta. At this point, I would only be doing it to get the achievement and the mounts since I purchase Master flying on all my characters. I might try again next year, but its not all that important enough to bother with the horrid way people do not work together in a battleground in order to be able to really do it at this point. Far to many me type people that only care about what they get and not giving other and opportunity to carry flags and such.</div></div><hr />

I saw it wasnt, but i was really bored with wow that week. I remember how often wow players would put in a ticket and get 1-7 days &quot;just to experience this event before it goes&quot; or &quot;To buy a game token&quot;<br />
<br />
So i sent a ticket asking if i could get 1 or 2 days gametime so i can have time to see if the game works on my computer, and how well it does. Because IF it does i was going to go ahead and buy a month just for the hell of it. I.E i was offering to give them money.<br />
<br />
The reply said that they USED to have a 10 day free trial which isnt available anymore and that they are hoping to go FTP soon.<br />
<br />
Like....why even tell me about a feature that is no longer active?! If you are going to disappoint me dont do it in a way that glaringly speaks of your inability to provide good customer service!<br />
<br />
I was bored of WoW and for nostalgias sake, was gonna play Maplestory again. Found out my account had been stolen in the 10 years I was away from it. No problem, gave all my stuff away beforehand anyway. Opened a ticket, and started a new account in the meantime. Know how long it took for them to respond to that ticket? 7 months. 7 months! To respond to me asking if I could recover my account, that I still had all details of. And they simply said, Sorry, we can't do that. Oi. At least you got a reply, even if it was disappointing. At least they have more than 1 guy doing CS more than one day per month.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2015-09-04, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the violet proto-drake on my feral druid back in WotLK first because she had better RNG when it came to masks during Hallow's End. Got it on my shaman the following year. I almost had it on my paladin the year after that but balked at doing School of Hard Knocks.<br />
<br />
While I hated School of Hard Knocks, I had more issue getting the PvP kills while transformed as a helper gnome achievement. I was a feral druid. This was when transforming resulted in losing your gnome costume. I spent most of my time queueing for Strands of the Ancients and hiding in siege engines while pretending to be a healer until I died and lost my costume, then I went on the offensive until the next game. I couldn't do anything until I died, though, and I refused to actually go resto on her. Besides the fact that I didn't have the gear for her to even go resto, I didn't want to heal on my druid. I already had a resto shaman and holy paladin at the time. Last thing I wanted was to be pigeon holed into healing because I had nearly every healer at max level and so could swap out as needed ... although my shaman was alliance and paladin horde.<br />
<br />
Interesting to see that 15.8% of players have the achievement but those on MMO-Champion say over 50% have gotten it. That certainly shows this forum is biased toward hardcore players and not indicative in the slightest of the player base as a whole.</div></div><hr />

I actually giggled. It's ok though, they can spin however they please. In the end the only thing that will matter is outside perception.

Why not? Everyone gets a free upgrade when they buy warlords, why not bring Death Knights up to speed. <br />

Most specs are getting overhauled, tweaking them to fit the fantasy of the spec. Some will be renamed.<br />
Can we get examples? Like what would be happening to Mages?<br />
<br />
<br />
The sewer class hall for Rogues looks great, not really like a sewer at all. It will have treasure chests.<br />
This is a fairly weak argument. Always excited to see what Blizzard is doing to spice up the game but wouldn't it be cool to bring ravenholdt back for those who played vanilla?<br />
<br />
<br />
No big update is planned for the Moonkin model, maybe some small tweaks.<br />
This seems a little silly when feral forms are getting an upgrade and special tweaks to their forms through the legendary fangs. Moonkin's get to show their weapon sure but why would feral get the special treatment. Has Blizzard tried to come up with new models and they didn't look any better or something?<br />
<br />
<br />
No Gnome hunters yet, maybe when it makes sense to add them.<br />
This just seems silly. Why not add Gnome hunters anyways, I don't see a need for a lore reason. I never saw why Night Elves suddenly became mages in the lore. <br />
<br />
<br />
No tabard tab is currently planned, but the new transmog system should help to clear up some space.<br />
The tabard tab was something that was promised a long time ago, the new transmog system should be flexible enough to add it. Make the code more flexible. <br />

The Park in Stormwind won't be repaired yet.<br />
I know there is &quot;marginal&quot; benefit to fixing this but it would definitely be a bonus to see a fully functioning Stormwind. Especially if we are going back to Azeroth. If we don't get an AH in the new Dalaran it would be sad for there to have to look at Stormwind's crater for yet another expansion. <br />

Really? The transformation has always been temporary for Demon Hunters. Even Illidan before he took the Skull of Gul'dan. You can probably kiss your armor and transmog goodbye if you stayed transformed.</div></div><hr />

As for &quot;Most specs are getting overhauled, tweaking them to fit the fantasy of the spec. Some will be renamed.&quot;<br />
*ahem*<br />
(Mage) Arcane -&gt; Conjure spec - Conjures better food and water, Mana Gems to return and er some improved buff. Doesn't do damage.<br />
(Shaman) Enhancement -&gt; Totem specialist - Dual wields Totems, however all abilities are totem based and one totem must be dropped to perform said action. Max 2 totems dropped at any one time due to all races only having two hands.<br />
(Warlock) Demonology -&gt; Demon Hunted - Has a new resource [Fear] which is gained by being near a Demon Hunter, note the fear spell has been removed to avoid confusion. Also has a giant target on it's back at all times.<br />
(Rogue) Combat -&gt; Swords Dancer - Places two swords on the floor and dances over them to grant buffs to nearby Players. Can only damage anything that attempts to step on said swords.<br />
(Demon Hunter) Missing 3rd Spec -&gt; Emotional - They say losing one sense (Sight in this case) grants you strength to one of your remaining senses, but in this case it's emotions. Feel more than any other class, and tell everyone how great you are because of it.<br />
(Warrior) Arms -&gt; More Arms - Now you have four arms! But can still only wield one weapon at a time.<br />
(Priest) Shadow -&gt; Retribution - Melee spec that relies on cool downs to do varied melee and holy based damage.<br />
(Paladin) All 3 specs -&gt; Removed.<br />
<br />

<br />
Can't get too fussed over the Timewalking kerfuffle myself though. It's basically a variation on the old Annual Pass.. stay subbed for x months, get a mount. They aren't even all that special: a recolored TBC mount and a rejected Store Mount, hardly 'must haves.'</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a line that intrigues me. It's kind of vague. Does it imply that they'll have a short-cast transformation into Demon form, much like the Worgen do? Or does it imply that their transformation will only last a short period of time. The &quot;Inner demon visuals&quot; line makes me think that it's more than likely going to be the former. <br />
<br />
I think that Perm Demon Form for Vengeance DH's makes sense.. I do seem to recall they said something about going toe-to-toe with big ass demons in your demon form. I'd have to watch the entire presser again, though.. and I'm not too keen on that right now.<br />

<br />
Iffy on the idea of profession materials from dungeons, though. Unless any person can get any material for any profession, kinda a kick in the pants for people with multiple alts with multiple professions. Though given the recent trend toward discouraging alt play I could see it happening.<br />
<br />
But hey, with no Garrison missions or daily cooldown chores to do it would probably be better to run two or three main alts instead of a stable.</div></div><hr />

Totally agree. Or at the very least give us a glyph or just flight form that gives us the permanent havoc flight form out of combat to use as a flying mount.<br />

Wow, that's just fucked up. You somehow earned the achievement without completing two of the required steps (Midsummer and Brewfest). That is a big ol' bug. You probably got world first on that.

Are you sure the meta didn't originally require Brewfest and Midsummer? I kinda remember it changing at some point...<br />

Are you sure the meta didn't originally require Brewfest and Midsummer? I kinda remember it changing at some point...<br />
<br />
But that doesn't make sense, either, as I earned it on a DK. Must have earned it a year or two later and something caused the dates on the achievements to mess up?<br />
WALSTIB never changed. Some of the individual holiday metas did, like Masquerade being removed as a requirement for Halloween, and Brew of the Year being removed as a req. for Brewfest. But something is clearly messed up when it says I earned Brewfest in April, because that is absolutely impossible. There's no two ways about it. I also vividly remember the circumstances under which I earned the mount. It was my first semester of college and the internet in the dorm couldn't handle WoW; would keep getting disconnected. So I had stopped playing in August, but I resubbed in September to finish up Brewfest for the achievement. I had to brave through the mass of disconnects to get those achievements.<br />
There's also a note on WoWWiki for WALSTIB - &quot;The earliest this achievement could be earned was 20 September 2009 (first day of 2009 Brewfest event). &quot;<br />
Hmm, actually, on 4/14/09, Noblegarden was added as a requirement. So I guess that's the source of the issue. Though I don't understand how that would affect anything regarding Brewfest or Midsummer...</div></div><hr />
