<br />
Demonology<br />
<br />
Diabolic Raiment 2-piece set bonus chance to activate reduced to 4% (was 20%).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Khor, Hammer of the Guardian (https://www.wowdb.com/items/163119-khor-hammer-of-the-guardian?bonusIDs=1477,4798) is now item level 120 to signify that it is a Transmog weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
Seafarer's Dubloon (https://www.wowdb.com/currencies/1710-seafarers-dubloon) items may no longer be used in PvP Island Expeditions.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: We're looking for ways to use Dubloons in the future, but for the time being, we do not feel that Dubloon use makes for a good experience in a PvP setting.<br />
<br />
Demolishers and Siege Tanks have been tuned to do less damage, with longer cooldowns on several of their abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Missions<br />
<br />
Stealth missions now only have two bosses or objectives to counter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Relentless (PvP Talent) and Hardiness (Orc Racial) no longer stack their Stun duration reduction effects.<br />
Fixed a bug that was preventing the weekly Conquest turn-in quests from being pushed to some players.<br />
Bonus Rolls for Rated Arena and Rated Battleground matches will now be removed when leaving the instance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Engineering<br />
<br />
The F.R.I.E.D., Organic Discombobulation Grenade (https://www.wowdb.com/items/153487-organic-discombobulation-grenade), and Thermo-Accelerated Plague Spreader (https://www.wowdb.com/items/153494-thermo-accelerated-plague-spreader) all now require fewer materials to craft. Rank 3 versions of their recipes should now also require fewer materials than Rank 2.<br />
<br />
Inscription<br />
<br />
Glyph of the Headhunter has been removed, as it is no longer a viable glyph.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Fixed a display issue when interacting with the Injured Zandalari Soldiers on “The Road of Pain”.<br />
<br />
<br />
World Quests<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug causing Ji’arak and Warbringer Yenajz to fail to offer a bonus roll prompt in some situations.<br />
Fixed an issue that could cause &quot;Save Our Scrolls!&quot; to go away and not reappear until the player exited and re-entered Torga's Rest.<br />
Sabertron should no longer fail to spawn after you “Kill the Sabertron Technician”.</div></div><hr />

Well, fuck you Blizzard. Fuck you very, very much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But... that'd have given them two chances for a weapon drop off the one boss, 3 with bonus roll, in a single run...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really disappointed with Blizzard about this. Give it stats or remove it, I don't like the idea of inflatable loot dropping from bosses. One of our DPS in raid last night got this weapon and was so happy.... he'll be gutted now. Oh well, relatively minor but I don't want to encourage them to drop Tmog items.</div></div><hr />

You can use Item Restoration service? Look it up drama boy.</div></div><hr />

Haha... Lets see how you would react if you lootet a BiS weapon in the beginning of an expansion and blizzard decided to delete it the following day ;) <br />
<br />
I bet most WoW players understand my frustration here - sad that you dont.</div></div><hr />

No can do, I used item restoration 2 weeks ago to fix a goof up of mine and I'm locked out of it, so I'm stuck using a 300 weapon that I bought from the AH because I disenchanted my 345 when I got the 355 from Taloc on Tuesday.</div></div><hr />

BIS weapon at a base ilvl 350? You are straight out lying here man. It might have good stats for you, but dont sell us bullshit that this was your bis.<br />
<br />
You dont know what BIS stands for im sure</div></div><hr />

Good thing restoration is every 15 days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, there are some workarounds or solutions, but it seems you're just taking the punches.<br />
<br />
If I got a shirt and the shirt-maker decided to rip a button for whatever reason I should be Ok with it because I can sew that extra button that's provided with it? They'll even bring me a new extra button after 15 days, so all should be cool?</div></div><hr />

you can either restore it via the restore item, or if you have no left &quot;charges&quot;, mail blizzard. they will restore your last weapon for free.<br />

Its amazing to me that they clearly have NO IDEA what to do with the currency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only hotfix I would accept for this is their removal. God awful design choice with those missions. Cannot get bonus loot and if you try, you may fail the base objective. Horrible</div></div><hr />

The item designers did get the memo that we don't have Artifact weapons anymore, right?</div></div><hr />

At least Blizz could give us - Orcs, some other alternative in this pvp talent tier, because we have now 1 option less than other races.</div></div><hr />

After the gut punch of the loot notification only to discover it is transmog only, they have to kick us while we are down. The kicker? It still requires 400+ gold to apply the transmog. It should at least be free. Killed 3 bosses, used both bonus rolls and all I got last night was the “Transmog Weapon”and have to pay gold to use it. Thanks, Blizzard.</div></div><hr />
