First, all 25-player raid bosses will drop more gold and those who dropped set tokens will drop one additional token.

Spell haste reducing global cooldown<br />
In 2.4, Spell Haste will reduce the global cool down on spells, down to a minimum of 1 second. It won't apply to melee and ranged abilities though however.<br />
<br />
Void crystal transmutations<br />
<br />
You're pretty close, but it's actually going to be a part of Enchanting. Once every 24 hours, through Enchanting (not Alchemy) you'll be able to split a Void Crystal into two Large Prismatic Shards. This is through a new recipe that's being added in 2.4.<br />
<br />
This helps reduce the exorbitant prices currently being seen for Large Prismatics, and helps raise the value of the Void Crystals. While this is the only change planned in 2.4 to help the Void Crystal prices, we're still looking at the possibility of additional 'help' for Void Crystal value in the future.<br />
<br />
Diminishing returns removed from Honor in 2.4<br />
As the PTR approaches we wanted to give everyone a preview of one of the larger changes for PvP that's currently planned for the 2.4 patch.<br />
<br />
Currently, diminishing returns are applied to all honorable kills. What diminishing returns mean for honor is that each subsequent kill of the same target will reward you with less and less honor; 10% less per kill to be exact. One of the major downsides to diminishing returns is that the calculations, for potentially hundreds of thousands of players, is too intense to do real time, so they are calculated during off-peak hours. This in turn requires that the honor you gain be temporarily displayed as &quot;estimated&quot; until the calculations are run. It's a system that we've certainly improved (moving the calculation from weekly to daily) but still always disliked. It creates a very uninteresting and sometimes aggravating or confusing detachment from your achievements and the actual reward.<br />
<br />
The reason for diminishing returns has always been to avoid the potential exploitation of the honor system. As the game has evolved, especially the honor and battleground systems, exploitation of the honor system now without diminishing returns would no longer be considered a lucrative alternative to simply participating in a battleground normally. We've also greatly improved our ability to monitor and track exploitation of this nature.<br />
<br />
We've reached a point where we're now confident that applying diminishing returns to honor is no longer necessary, and we're currently planning to remove it with the 2.4 patch.<br />
<br />
With this change we’re including a few restrictions as well though: Players that have the resurrection sickness debuff will not be worth any honor, and if a player dies 50 times or more during a battleground they won’t be worth any honor for the remainder of that battle.<br />
<br />
What the removal of diminishing returns means for you is that as soon as you defeat an opponent that rewards you honor, you will receive that honor, and you will be able to spend it right then. There will no longer be an estimate, and you will no longer need to wait until the next day until you can actually spend it. Your achievements through honor-based PvP will be instantaneous.<br />

Druids - Lacerate<br />
The Feral bears will be seeing an improvement with Lacerate dealing additional damage based on your attack power.<br />
<br />
Mages - Conjured manna biscuits changes<br />
I do know that in patch 2.4 players can only carry 80 of your delicious conjured manna biscuits at one time. As a result, you should experience less banquet-creating frustration. Sorry, the spell icon will remain the same and not look any more new or unique. <br />
<br />
Priests - Fear ward in shadowform<br />
Maybe being able to use Fear Ward while in Shadow Form would help? Yeah, I like this idea, we'll roll with it in the next patch.<br />
<br />
Shamans - Healing grace<br />
One thing that will help is that in patch 2.4, healing grace will reduce the chance that all of your spells will be dispelled by 10/20/30%.<br />
<br />
Warlocks - Ritual of summoning changes<br />
Patch 2.4 will remove the restriction for Ritual of Summoning that prevents you from summoning players into instances. Provided the player meets the instance requirements, you'll be able to summon them in from anywhere in the world.<br />
<br />
Warriors - Endless rage buff<br />
That's the plan, and just to clarify the tooltip/functionality of this talent is not changing.<br />
<br />
Warriors - Offhand weapons critical strikes<br />
While I agree there is no exact number to shoot for in crit, in 2.4 we plan to make the off-hand weapon critical hits from Whirlwind trigger Flurry and Rampage which should improve damage a bit.<br />
<br />
Fishing daily quests<br />
Anyway, along the lines of fishing we're adding a new daily quest for fishing. Once 2.4 goes live (or once the PTRs are up) you'll want to visit &quot;the mysterious old man&quot; near Silmyr Lake outside of Shattrath. He's sure to offer treasures beyond your wildest dreams... or ramble on about how they had to color their own margarine during the war. Either/Or.<br />
<br />
Interface improvements - Looting<br />
Since I've decided there's absolutely no relevant thread I could ever find to throw out this info... We're making some improvements to the way the looting UI and related functions work in 2.4. These are just a couple of the changes planned.<br />
<br />
First when you loot a Bind on Pickup item that only you can pick up (such as Heroic Badges) you'll no longer see the confirmation dialog. One less pop-up to deal with, obviously you want your badges, AMIRITE?<br />
<br />
Also when you loot a Bind of Pickup item the confirmation window is going to list the name of the item in the window. You'll be able to identify that you're getting the right items much easier now.<br />
<br />

You didnt understand yet?...<br />
Blizz doesnt not want to repeat the Naxx-error, that is creating a bad ass raid that everybody loved but so few got to see.<br />
So as time goes by, they help the slower-progressing guild get into the high-end stuff before expansion.<br />
IF you are already in that content, it doesnt touch you anyway, and you still get to show your epeen saying &quot;I killed illidan before the nerfs&quot;.<br />
<br />
IF you are in a slow progressing guild, this is a god send that'll help you see more content before you get the next expansion.<br />
<br />
And i can bet that they will be nerfing some bosses in the tier 5 bracket... wait and see. Just like they nerfed everything tier4 a few months back.<br />
<br />
And, imho, its a good thing. If you are UBER LEET WTFPWN you already progressed past that content anyway...</div></div><hr />

Raiding changes that are late by 1 year and won't change the fact that 25 man raiding is quite dead and not worth it.<br />

<br />
<br />
If I were a betting man, my money would be on &quot;no&quot;. They're simply going to add something to the actual &quot;Spell Haste Rating&quot; that decreases the GCD. So I'd imagine you could stack spell haste as any class and reduce your GCD. At least that seems the easiest way to implement it.</div></div><hr />

Yep and another Elemental Shaman nerf.<br />
<br />
In blizzards attempt to Balance arena they are nerfing our only Utility (burst) because it actually works. This means that, once again, end game PvE will get nerfed in an attempt to balance arenas...</div></div><hr />

Any REAL druid tank doesn't rely solely on lacerate damage, and can generate enough threat to hold agro, bleed immune or not.</div></div><hr />

Such as? It is impossible to exploit outside BGs because the ressurection cooldown for repeated kills makes honor farming individuals practically impossible. The only downside I can see for BGs is it will make mid-BG kill farming much more profitable than objective capture.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lacerate is main threat, because it's instant, and without cooldown. Mangle got a long cooldown, and sucks if you miss (Which happends alot, considering the lack of +hit on druid tanking gear). Maul is on a 3 (or was it 3.5) second swing timer, which makes it really poor to gain snap-aggro with.<br />

This lacerate change will blow my TPS though the roof, guess I can beat prot. paladins again now , yay!<br />

Shortly after BC was released, summoning throughout ALL of Netherstorm was disabled except via the meeting stone in front of Tempest Keep. This was to prevent cheesing of running sub-70s through the TK instances, which would normally require a level 70 and a flying mount.<br />
With the reactivation of summoning inside instances, will they disable summoning to Tempest Keep 5-mans or will they just lift the summoning restriction over Netherstorm?<br />
We're going to lift the summoning restriction in Netherstorm.<br />

I wouldn't call not being viable in the current drawn out mana draining arenas a lot. They are pretty much required for heroics, they kick ass in BGs, they do very well in raids and they do pretty well in BGs. Yeah they have it tough in arenas now but they had it easy in the arena in early seasons. The problem is mages are working fine in most areas of the game, that makes it very hard to make changes to them in arena without pushing them towards being overpowered elsewhere. <br />
<br />
The mage problem is that they are a disruptive class, sheep, snares, silence all are designed to disrupt their opponents and are countered more and more as opponents get more organised which in arena is pretty much everyone as you get any decent rating.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">jkw</div><div class="date">2008-02-03, 08:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you trying to say that retribution is anywhere NEAR fixed?<br />
<br />
Not completely. But at least it's starting to take shape. With the reverted nerf of Vengeance, spell damage removal from Crusader Strike, S3 gloves and so on.<br />
It will be interesting if they change the complete useless set-bonuses of t4-t6 as well.<br />
<br />
Tier 4<br />
<br />
2 pieces: Increases the damage bonus of your Judgement of the Crusader by 15%.<br />
4 pieces: Increases the damage dealt by your Judgement of Command by 10%.<br />
<br />
Craptastical.<br />
<br />
Tier 5<br />
<br />
2 pieces: Reduces the cost of your Judgements by 35.<br />
4 pieces: Each time you cast a Judgement, there is a chance it will heal all nearby party members for 244 to 256.<br />
<br />
Change #2 to -35 on seals or something else.<br />
Change #4 to chance to give party 244 to 256 mana instead.<br />
<br />
Tier 6<br />
<br />
2 pieces: Your melee attacks have a chance to grant you 50 mana.<br />
4 pieces: Increases the damage dealt by your Hammer of Wrath ability by 10%.<br />
<br />
#2 Kind of useful, but still not worth getting.<br />
#4 Based on spell damage and the dpm is not worth wasting.<br />
<br />
If they change all of these to something useful there might be a slight chance that they are worth getting over random dps gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins won't ever get fixed, because they cry if they get their burst damage removed, but yet they want substational dps :p<br />
Not going to happend. Paladins is definitive the most emo class after mages.<br />
<br />
The thing is that all this freaking hype about Arena balance is probably the reason they don't &quot;dare&quot; to fix Paladins.<br />
<br />
Least but not last:<br />
<br />
Alliance Paladins can now learn Seal of Blood at level 65.<br />
Horde Paladins can now learn Seal of Vengeance at level 65.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holy has been fine for 3 years in PVE. In pvp (arena) it's bad. Just look at the 2v2 and 3v3 brackets. But blizzard keeps telling us &quot;you rock in 5v5, stop crying&quot;.<br />
If only they would make flash instant. If one spams flash it's almost as fast as the gcd (with no spellhaste). By removing cast time you make pallies a whole lot more useful in lower brackets without changing a thing in pve. My hps will stay the same but i can be a mobile, harder to interrupt, healer.</div></div><hr />
