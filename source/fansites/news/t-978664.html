Blue PostsTier 13<br />
[...] Most of this tier was attempting to play off a new ability the class got in Cataclysm, so for instance Time Warp for mages and Wild Mushroom for druid, in some cases (like warrior or warlock) there's playing off of the raid and those themes, and then for others it's a bit more just doing something we think represents the class in a more abstract manner. We're putting them up as soon as they're done, essentially, so from here on out they're likely to be posted rather randomly. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/198238/tier-13) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3182449884?page=7#126))<br />
<br />
Wind Shear<br />
It's still a part of the plan and you'll find out more information once we get into discussing patch 4.3 class balance. I'm not really able to reveal any plans as of yet. Without any context the information I could provide would only lead to a slew of follow-up questions, which will be answered better in our upcoming announcements.

<br />
Tier 13 and Future Armor Art<br />
There is only one objective truth about every single armor set we've ever made -- some people love, and some people hate, each of 'em. The art is completely subjective and your tastes reflect your viewpoint.<br />
<br />
That said, our design philosophy for epic sets is not changing at all with the introduction of Transmogrification. We're still going to keep designing what we think is fitting and awesome for each class and tier. We want people to want to wear all of the major armor sets we release. In the future you'll just have the option of deciding what set fits you best aesthetically and adventuring to obtain it, without worrying about the stats. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/197850/forcing-us-to-use-the-transmorg) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3182738527?page=1#20))<br />

Paypal and Diablo III Auction House<br />
We're pleased to announce that in most regions, PayPal will be our payment-service partner for the Diablo III auction house, allowing players who trade with real-world currency the ability to cash out the spoils of their battle-torn adventures via a PayPal account.<br />
<br />
PayPal will also soon be added in several regions as a payment option on Battle.net, providing another convenient and secure payment method for digital purchases of Blizzard products and services.<br />
<br />
We’ll share region-related specifics, as well as further details on everything mentioned above, in the near future. Stay tuned!

<br />
Haha yeah.<br />
<br />
I never found the info in the magazine compelling enough to pay so much for it. Frankly I don't read a magazine for ~premium paper~ or ~glossy photos~ or whatever made it seemingly so expensive. The content was lackluster and, generally, nothing that an avid reader of fansites would not have already known. At least that's how it seemed.<br />
<br />
I don't think they did a very good job promoting the magazine, either. I totally forgot it existed until just now. XD</div></div><hr />

Note that the original poster that the blue responded to mentioned restro shamans. It might be the case this only get nerfed for restro, which as much fun interrupting halfus or alyas's adds as restro is, I can see requiring a dps to do it making sense.</div></div><hr />

Because the mere existence of a single 6-second-CD interrupt isn't already OP in PvP. Nerfing it to a 10 second CD makes a lot more sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Magazines currently out, generally speaking, cater to an older demographic or a primarily female audience. While it's a generalization, individuals who play are heavily involved in technology, play video games, tech savvy typically don't subscribe to magazines.<br />
<br />
Walk down the magazine aisle of your grocery store and take a look - the magazines are geared for an older demographic or young female teenagers. The magazines geared for mid 20's-late 30's don't generally target gamers.</div></div><hr />

It would have been the perfect place for a few reveals, and putting some in there would have gotten it a lot more sales. Unfortunately, the last issue was about Firelands; it was FULL of great developer interviews about how they felt about Firelands and what was going to go into it and what kind of content you would have access to... but the issue wasn't released until AFTER the patch was. A bit of a wasted effort there.<br />

<br />
1. Increase cooldown to 10 or 12.<br />
2. Add a talent for enhancement and elemental to reduce the cooldown back to 6.<br />
3. Profit.</div></div><hr />

Please that's the only thing shamans have against classes with overpowered self heals and range dps with dots and two shot attacks this may be a normal QQ but its dam true and you know it you've ever played a shaman. Also happens to be the best in game interrupt for raids.</div></div><hr />

I care to disagree.<br />
For Healers in PvP it is OP i'd happily admit that.<br />
But taking it to 10 seconds is basically messing over both dps specs in PvE and PvP.<br />

Shaman Dps get taken for 3 reasons:<br />
1. Fast Interrupts.<br />
2. BL (GG Mages)<br />
3. Mediocre Single Target Dps</div></div><hr />

who cares that the rich boy have great stuff on them because they paid real money for it ? just play and have fun lol, and no, i'm not a blizzard fan boy, i just see that the game will be a very good one and it's not an AH real money that will block me to appreciate 99.9% of the rest of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I will not play Diablo III because Blizzard have chosen to jump into bed with Payscum. <br />
<br />
Whenever you bring up the subject of how crappy PayPal are, you always get people saying &quot;Weird, I've never had a problem with them&quot; - well, it's not like everyone does, is it? Until you have a problem with PayPal, you're fine. As soon as you have a problem, though, you may as well kiss your cash goodbye. <br />
<br />
My last dealings with PayPal came after I sold an item on eBay and took payment through them. The guy I sold it to told PayPal I hadn't shipped; they gave him a refund and, as I'd already withdrawn the money, demanded that I pay it back into my account. I informed them that I had a proof of posting certificate and would send a copy to them on request, but as I had shipped it was no longer my responsibility. I also sent them an e-mail the buyer had sent me telling an entirely different story to the one he gave PayPal - that his flatmate had used his account without him knowing - along with the results of an eBay trawl that showed he had bought an item identical to mine on the same day, and an e-mail from the seller of that item informing me that the buyer had made no attempt to reclaim money from him. <br />
<br />
The next communication I had from PayScum was an e-mail informing me that my account was being locked and a letter notifying me that they had set the bailiffs on me. They tried to take my money and worse, they damaged my credit rating, and they did so in the face of indisputable proof that I was the one being defrauded. That is who Blizzard are dealing with - and that is why I won't do business with them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you had a bad ordeal with Paypal. It doesn't mean you should berate the game, let alone be completely deterred just because of an OPTIONAL service within the game. You can't argue that Paypal is one of the higher known currency transaction services and Blizzard/Activison chose to use their service. Sorry you had a hard time with Paypal but it really has nothing to do with the core gameplay of Diablo.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doombringer</div><div class="date">2011-09-17, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The magazine was pretty awesome, considering it did not have advertisements (even for WoW-related items -- there may have been articles featuring/referencing these items, but no actual advert pages), was full color front to back, and often featured original art and insightful interviews with Blizzard folks and community members. <br />
<br />
That said, it became clear that they couldn't go on doing this. Print is expensive, and Blizzard has existing means of getting information to players, in a far less costly medium: their websites, and interviews they give to other webzines/partners/etc. BlizzCon too, though that is a pricy venture in and of itself.</div></div><hr />

Think a little more abstract. Who or what is famous for using smoke bombs and similar tricks to avoid detection?<br />
<br />
Yeah. Ninjas.<br />
<br />
However, it isn't a hard or fast rule to use a Cataclysm ability to design the tier set. Warlocks and Warriors were clearly exempted from this. Paladins may get an 'inquisitor' set since it is a good fit, but can you say that the Shaman tier 13 fits with... uh, Unleash Elements? No.</div></div><hr />

Those two things are entirely unrelated. The magazine was cancelled because it couldn't keep up with current content and by the time an issue was released, the information it had was slightly outdated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. PRINTED MEDIA is on the decline, this has been seen everywhere in the world. Video game magazines have been suffering and many have disappeared in the past few years. The WoW magazine was a bad business move, and I have no idea why they wasted their resources and time on something that was doomed from the start. You take video game magazines poor sales due to the internet, then make a magazine focused on ONE game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This has nothing to do with WoW's decline; do you know nothing about how much magazines and newspapers are suffering right now or the economy exacerbating the effect? I mean, think about it: you go to MMO-Champion, and have access to sites like WoW.com and plenty of other WoW fansites. And then there's IGN.com, Escapist, Kotaku, and dozens of other gaming news websites for all-encompassing gaming news. Why would ANYONE buy a magazine devoted to just one game when there's already tons of fansites that provide the exact same information, even when NOT just devoted to one game?</div></div><hr />

They've changed/plan to change by October, alot. Including extra fees between buyers and sellers from various countries and more. Worst case scenario could see the Blizzard fees and the paypal fees causing you to potentially lose money instead of making money on transactions(ie someone buys something from your for 30 bucks but the fees make you pay 35 so you have to cough up 5 bucks yourself... again in the worst case scenario).<br />

It was SO expensive and you didn't get very many issues. I've subscribed to some expensive magazines in my time but at least I'd get them every week or every month...not like every quarter or whatever. As far as the tier sets are concerned - overall I'm still unimpressed. I was pleased that the druid gear was once again a robe and didn't look like an old grandma robe (think T10). However I have to say that the mage and shaman sets have been...well...Blah? I don't know. The mage armor looks like a quilting bee project with a headlamp and the shaman looks ridiculous...then again that could just be because they decided to model it on an orc - and orcs are ridiculous. As silly as it was to use humans for class models that humans can't even be part of - at least it was a good neutal base to display armor. I wish Blizzard's armor skinning crew would LEARN HOW TO MAKE A FUCKING HELM WORTH DISPLAYING!!! Helms have to be the ultimate downfall of any gear set. Sure, there have been a few in the past that have been really nice (druid T8 was among the best ever); but overall they're usually ugly, awkward and the first thing you think when you put it on is &quot;OMGMUSTHIDETHISPIECERIGHTNOW!&quot; Honestly...LEARN TO HELM, guys.</div></div><hr />

Nope. PRINTED MEDIA is on the decline, this has been seen everywhere in the world. Video game magazines have been suffering and many have disappeared in the past few years. The WoW magazine was a bad business move, and I have no idea why they wasted their resources and time on something that was doomed from the start. You take video game magazines poor sales due to the internet, then make a magazine focused on ONE game. This, there's no point with the majority of printed media anymore with the internet giving out the same information.</div></div><hr />

(though not world PVP - you take your chances there) That way they can stop nerfing PVE or PVP in the name of (PVP or PVE).<br />
<br />
I've wanted this for a very long time, something like the colossal smash change, thats what you suggest right? alot of people want it, if they could separate pvp and pve the game would be balanced. God knows i'd love it.<br />

as for the blizzcon store, my general feel is &quot;thats all they'll have?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course things happen because of money. I don't believe it is because they're having money problems, though. It's likely that it wasn't a successful venture. You know, putting money into it, and not getting a viable profit. As such, pull the plug. Makes sense. Also, it's a very specialized magazine. The contents would be put online right way. Print media is very much in decline as it is for more broad publications.</div></div><hr />

2. Add a talent for enhancement and elemental to reduce the cooldown back to 6.<br />
3. Profit.<br />
Problem is, I also do my own share of interrupts as resto in PvE. So no, it's not a solution unless Blizzard can create the same special PvE/PvP rule that they did for warrior's Colossus Smash.<br />
<br />
Whatever happened to classes having their own special perks that others don't? Having the best interrupt in the game is pretty much the only thing shamans have left. We lost our Enhanced Totems talent, Windfury totem was changed to melee/ranged haste in WotLK and nerfed even further for Cata, Mana Tide totem got a kick to the gut (with a lackluster talent to &quot;compensate&quot; for the loss)... I could just go on and on, but I've made my point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, no, no. You can buy GOLD on the REAL MONEY auction house, permanently linking the two currencies. EVERYONE who plays Diablo 3 will be directly affected by the real money AH. The gold AH prices will be directly controlled by the money AH, and you'd better believe that there is going to be an incredible amount of gold inflation. This is Blizzard's way of being able to claim that there is no subscription fee, while setting up a situation where - due to the epic inflation - you will have to pay up if you are going to be competitive. The fact that they have some people fooled into thinking they're actually going to make heaps of money is the most hilarious part - Blizz will take a chunk out, PayPal will take another chunk out, and the default option is to deposit into the Blizz Store, anyway (which can only be used to purchase Blizz items).</div></div><hr />

1st Markting was bad! Never see nothing about magazine anywhere.<br />
2nd Most of the people like only buy magazines most of the time because you want the CD with demos, etc. Now with internet you can read what the magazine say without pay 1c and you can also download all the content on cds. So no point to buy any pc magazine anymore.<br />
<br />
I was sub for 5 magazines in the olds day now i sub 0! No point.<br />
<br />
About shaman interrup nerf. Yes plz! Is annoying not to be able to cast a single cast heal in arenas becasue shamam can interrup all casts! Specialy Restos who most of the times have nothing to do. Make the CD the same as Counterpsell and a one talent for ench to make it to the others melees time 8/10s.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While what you say it correct. The problem is, is that it is very competitive and if it wasn't, then the illegal sites that have been running for all these years would not still be in business.<br />
<br />
Anytime you put gamers head to head, even when that competition is not recorded or scored. The players will do that themselves.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, they are different offers depending on what subscription you had bought for the magazine (half a year, year) etc...<br />

They've changed/plan to change by October, alot. Including extra fees between buyers and sellers from various countries and more. Worst case scenario could see the Blizzard fees and the paypal fees causing you to potentially lose money instead of making money on transactions(ie someone buys something from your for 30 bucks but the fees make you pay 35 so you have to cough up 5 bucks yourself... again in the worst case scenario).<br />

Paypal before being bought out by Ebay was a terrible company. TERRIBLE, they have gotten a lot better as long as your not stupid enough to ship an item without seller protection. <br />
As for selling a $30 item COSTING you $5... somebody never took math. You can't get fee's in the sub 100% range to be beyond the money sent to you. At worst your looking at 10% or so in fee's Still a rip off, but not nearly in the 130% range.</div></div><hr />

They are not &quot;adding things.&quot; They are offering more things for people who have a higher balance to make things fair.</div></div><hr />

So, the note said that since the Kwurky plush is not longer available at retail (I think it was only purchasable during Blizzcon 2009 and 2010), its value is based on Ebay auctions. I've looked it up and currently there is one up for £94.97 + shipping.<br />
<br />
What I don't understand yet is the 2-year PC Gamer subscription offer. It doesn't say if it is the paper edition or the digital one.</div></div><hr />

Popular over 10 years ago you mean? From diablo II and warcraft 3? We've seen much better since then and these types of games are holding the gaming community back, they can do much better then platform games now. I wont be buying it anyway, rather spend my time and money on a real rpg like elder scrolls V.</div></div><hr />

Oh, gotta love how they only give you two weeks to send in a written response... you know, considering they took the subscriptions online in all of 5 minutes AND more importantly, feel that just sending you an email is fine. Yeah, we have to send a written letter requesting refund but it was just peachy for them to simply send us an email. Why can't we email them or do it online on a website, you know, the same way your took our money? I can guarantee they will just conveniently &quot;lose&quot; some of the letters as well. Their actions are beyond disappointing, Blizzard's definitely changed over the past years.</div></div><hr />

Dont forget takes them 8-10 weeks to give us a refund too. Which is pretty lame. Since as you said, took them 5 mins to get our subs and take the money out of whatever we used to pay with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get this. Or well I do and I don't. I can understand you feel they are worth nothing, but each pet is sold seperatly on the blizzard store for $10 each, and seeing as you get 6 of them, voila, $60.</div></div><hr />

There's no such thing as an outdated game play style.<br />
<br />
Also if you think diablo 2 and warcraft 3 were the same kind of game, I think you need to have a CAT scan to make sure everything is working out in your noodle.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cows For Life</div><div class="date">2011-09-19, 08:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just clicked through my offer. It comes up right in the middle of the screen 'Accept Offer' for the pets. Big fonts. Big button to click. Right at the the bottom in a tiny font is 'no thanks I just want a refund' lol. Clicking this then tells you you have to write a physical letter and mail it to future publishing in the US with all your details in and it will take 8-10 weeks to get your refund. As I recall it took me about 5 minutes to purchase the subscription entirely via the interwebs. They really don't want to make it easy to get your money back XD. On the plus side they timed it well with me cancelling my wow sub last month.<br />
<br />
They do seem to be making the best effort to make subscribers jump through as many hoops as possible to get a refund.<br />
<br />
<br />
Problem is, I also do my own share of interrupts as resto in PvE. So no, it's not a solution unless Blizzard can create the same special PvE/PvP rule that they did for warrior's Colossus Smash.<br />
<br />
Whatever happened to classes having their own special perks that others don't? Having the best interrupt in the game is pretty much the only thing shamans have left. We lost our Enhanced Totems talent, Windfury totem was changed to melee/ranged haste in WotLK and nerfed even further for Cata, Mana Tide totem got a kick to the gut (with a lackluster talent to &quot;compensate&quot; for the loss)... I could just go on and on, but I've made my point.<br />
<br />
Tell your tanks and DPS to suck less? It shouldn't be the healer job to interrupt.</div></div><hr />

It is when you end up with a raid composition that's short on interrupts.</div></div><hr />
