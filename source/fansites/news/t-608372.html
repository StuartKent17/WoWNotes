If the game has 10 classes and 30 specs, why do you only see 5-6 specs in arena teams capable of competing for first place?<br />

I can't currently get to the EU armory. But there are 7 of 9 classes represented. 9 different major specs ( the uncommon ones here is the UA lock and spriest). And 7 different team makeups not taking into account teams that ran 2 different setups. From a pool of 8 qualifiers. <br />
<br />
Pretty good variety, all things considered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You have to keep in mind that pvp changed with going from pre tbc to tbc. Fights became a lot longer instead of just 2shotting that it was pre tbc. <br />
If we than include the way arena changed the game you can see more changes that directly affect the use of racials.Pre tbc warstomp was one of the best racials simple because it gave a 2 sec stun, in which you could almost kill your opponent. (of course warstomp is still good).<br />
<br />
But in tbc racials like shadowmelt became a lot more useful since it allows for more drinking while fighting (which became important vs not important at all). Also escape artist got better because of the chain ccing going on. WotF is still really good horde side of course. But so is stoneform to remove bleeds / vipersting / rogue poisons etc.<br />
And perception still is only useful if you know a rogue is around, but because of the arena setting you can pretty easily know if a rogue is around or not -&#61514;.<br />
<br />
While lots of the horde racials give them more abilities to do dmg, and the stun resist orc racial was nerfed with tbc.<br />
<br />
Not saying horde racials are bad though -:)</div></div><hr />
