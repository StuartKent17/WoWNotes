Cho'gall, once a key executor of the nihilistic Twilight's Hammer's vision, has been struck down. Lady Sinestra, consort of Deathwing and mother to the malevolent black dragons Nefarian and Onyxia, has fallen at the hands of great heroes. Ragnaros, lord of the realm of fire in the Elemental Plane, and Al’Akir, baron of the realm of air -- both mighty arbiters of Deathwing's destructive ends -- have themselves been purged. But even with so many of Deathwing's servants now vanquished, he freely roams the skies of Azeroth, wreaking havoc on the land and its people. It's in these darkest of hours that the forces standing against Deathwing must carry out a desperate plan to put an end to his devastating twilight flight.<br />
<br />
The other Dragon Aspects, with allegiance from Thrall, have devised a dangerous and unorthodox strategy to bring Deathwing down once and for all. But to do so, they must acquire the Dragon Soul from a pivotal moment in the distant past... and they're going to need your help. In patch 4.3, level-85 players will gain access to three new Heroic-difficulty five-player dungeons, embarking on quests to aid the Aspects and other familiar faces in a fight against Deathwing, the Twilight's Hammer, ancient armies of the Burning Legion and Highborne... and even time itself.<br />
<br />
Much like the experience in the five-player content of Icecrown Citadel, players must quest through these dungeons sequentially to unlock access to them in the Dungeon Finder. You'll also be afforded the opportunity for all-new epic loot, including new dungeon sets. While these sets aren't broken down by class and contain no set bonuses, they offer cohesive aesthetic looks for each armor type: cloth, leather, mail, and plate. These set pieces can be taken from the grasps of defeated bosses in each of the new Heroic dungeons. <br />
<br />
Now read on for a taste of what lies ahead and -- interestingly enough -- behind you in the first of these three new dungeons: End Time.<br />
<br />
End Time<br />
One of an infinite number of potential outcomes, this timeway depicts the desolate future of Azeroth should its defenders fail to stop Deathwing. In this bleak future, Nozdormu has identified an anomaly that bars access to both the past and the Dragon Soul: a powerful creature from out of time, living alone amid time-twisted echoes of the past.<br />
In order for Nozdormu to provide you the ability to travel back in time to a point before the Dragon Soul was hidden by Malfurion Stormrage from anyone who’d seek its power, you must first go to a distant and desolate future to discover the anomaly blocking the past. You'll find yourself in a very different Dragonblight, stripped of its snowy landscape, with little more than ruins of the once-great dragonshrines. Wyrmrest Temple itself stands only as a reminder of Deathwing's madness -- what's left of his scorched remains is impaled atop the structure.<br />
<br />
Before you confront the creature disrupting Nozdormu's access to the past, you'll first be called to fight any two of the following four ostensibly familiar leaders, chosen at random each time you play through End Time.<br />
<br />
Excerpts from the Dungeon Journal<br />
<br />
Echo of Sylvanas: Spawned from shattered timeways and cloistered within the Ruby Dragonshrine, a maddened fragment of the Forsaken's leader, Sylvanas Windrunner, waits restlessly. Having lost everything and unable to find peace, this tormented echo aches for a chance to unleash her dark fury at anything still living within these barren, time-twisted wastes.<br />
<br />
Echo of Tyrande: Once high priestess of Elune and leader of the night elves, this time-twisted fragment of Tyrande Whisperwind now wanders the desolate future of Azeroth. Enveloped by eternal midnight, she is forever separated from the comforting light of Elune and torn by questions about why her goddess did nothing to put an end to such madness.<br />
<br />
Echo of Jaina: The tormented fragment of Jaina Proudmoore has been split and infused within the shattered pieces of her staff. To restore balance to the timeways, this echo must be defeated. However, the devastating magical power possessed by the once-proud ruler of Theramore is hardly lost to her time-havocked spectre. In this future Azeroth, she is only divided, and waiting....<br />
<br />
Echo of Baine: Enraged by his failure to protect the world and, most importantly, the Horde, this time-ravaged shade of Baine Bloodhoof lingers within the ruins of the Obsidian Dragonshrine. Although he's still as powerful as the tauren high chieftain from the present, within this shattered future Azeroth, this guilt-ridden echo is little more than a discordant vessel of unquenchable malice and anger.<br />
<br />
These long-dead heroes are mere echoes of their former glory, further warped by the corruptive force of time. Their presence here is a great mystery, even to Nozdormu. Once these shades have been laid to rest, the maniacal figure blocking Nozdormu's vision will be revealed at the Bronze Dragonshrine. None of the Dragon Aspects could have predicted what entity would have such power to interrupt the sight of the Timeless One… the ability to create a new and infinite dragonflight. Only by destroying a mysterious dragon known as Murozond will you give Azeroth's protectors the opportunity to avoid the potential outcome to which your eyes bear witness.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for part two of our patch 4.3 dungeons preview: Well of Eternity.<br />

Aspects are the ones which keep the old golds locked away because of their life force or some werid shiz so this is supposed to be in a future where the Hour of Twilight happened and in order for it to actually happen and for the Old Gods to control Azeroth, all dragon aspects must die - even deathwing himself<br />
<br />
As to how he was impaled on the temple.. well I have not the slightest idea</div></div><hr />

Deathwing didn't win, the Old Gods did. He 'wins' for the Old Gods and subsequently probably impaled himself on the temple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's just a means to an end for the Old Gods. Their plans to gain freedom have stretched for ages and (granted, non-cannon) as stated in the book, even Sargeras was said to be weaker than the Old Gods are. So I'd imagine that sicne they're now free in this timeline... they dispose of loose ends.</div></div><hr />

Well, it was hidden for 10000 years until the dark horde found it. That's a long time period for Nozdormu to retrieve it, have thrall use it and put it back again.</div></div><hr />

Saw it coming across the ages...but yeah. If everything else in that future is twisted, why wouldn't Nozdormu be?

I was hoping to see some kind of future lore of Garrosh versus Varian and one of them winning. Deathwing being impaled is confusing, theyre holding a story element back. So a DW raid would have you fighting his &quot;old god&quot; form in the Maelstrom, but his regular form somehow is killed on a temple? What gives? Even if he committed suicide, w/e old god is controlling him would still show signs of presence on his form when dead, tentacles or something protruding from his flesh to try and stop what he is doing. I wonder if in this future the old god becomes its own entity and form, and leaves DW, and something else happens to DW that ends with him being impaled. That would explain the &quot;echoes&quot; of our fallen leaders?</div></div><hr />

No, it's actually because Blizzard hates male Dragons and wants them all killed off. Malygos, Deathwing, and Nozdramu (who was set up as a villain back in WoTLK), all villains that need to be killed. Alextraza and Ysera are perfectly sane though, and always will be since people keep drooling over their elf shapes. Personally I'd rather join Deathwing and kill Alextraza and Ysera.<br />
<br />
So... Who impaled Deathwing on the tower? They originally said the End Time was what would happen if Deathwing wins. He wins and then gets killed? Ok..</div></div><hr />

The novels aren't canon. The game itself is, because it's coming straight from Blizzard. The best the authors can do is hope their stuff doesn't get retconned by Blizzard in the game.</div></div><hr />

Genuinely think this game would be 15x more interesting if the 'warped' future actually came to pass. I'd love to see content where we ultimately fail in stopping the bad dude, and as a result everything is changed dramatically. Would reset all this terrible lore business, and give the game a fresh start where story isn't constantly being eaten through as the bank of ideas run dry. <br />
<br />
I'd love a darker warcraft :/</div></div><hr />

Twilight dragons already tried to kill Sinestra once, even when she created them.<br />
<br />
Probably the twilight prophet order him killed him or the old gods once he has lost its usefulness (getting rid of the aspects protecting the world) had him killed since, yow know, after all, he is also a dragon aspect created to protect the world.</div></div><hr />

It would be, if it were the current timeline; remember it all takes place in a bleak future, merely showing us (and more importantly, Nozdormu) what exactly will happen should we fail to defeat Deathwing. A similar future would have befallen Azeroth I'm sure way back if Sargeras' original invasion at hte Well of Eternity had worked, for example.</div></div><hr />

Each aspect was killed by his own powers, which means Nozdormu was killed basically stopping him in time, so he wouldnt have rotten.<br />

Directly from the interview posted in the news post immediately preceding this one:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Where does the gear fit in terms of the new 5-mans? Will they be like ZA and ZG were or will they be a bit lower… where will they fit?<br />
Ghostcrawler: A little bit higher… we’re still debating the exact numbers but I think they’re probably slotting it maybe between Normal Firelands and Heroic Firelands. It will be slightly weaker than the Looking for Raid tier and obviously weaker than the remaining Deathwing raid tier.</div></div><hr />

Basically, here's the structure of the 5 mans.<br />
<br />
End Time: Nozdormu sends us into the future to show us what would happen should we fail, and also to stop Murozond from blocking the timestream. Once this is done, Nozdormu sends us to...<br />
Well of Eternity: To seek out the Demon Soul with Thrall as a weapon to use against Deathwing. Once done, Nozdormu returns us to...<br />
Current time, Dragonblight: To escort Thrall to Wyrmrest, and give the Demon Soul over. It is here that the raid starts.</div></div><hr />

Actually I was just wondering about how much of &quot;nobodies&quot; we are at this stage of the game, and how major lore characters compare to us. Just imagine what we, the heroes of Azeroth have accomplished. We killed Illidan. We killed not one, but two old gods (whom the titans themselves needed to imprison, but we managed to kill them, nevermind). We defeated the Kil'jaeden, we defeated the Lich King.... yeah, old gods, dragon aspects, elemental lords.... <br />
<br />
So seriously, what compares to the Heroes of Azeroth at this point? And after we kill the Aspect of Death himself? We pretty much on par with titans and the mightiest characters ever mentioned, a bit weird, isn't it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, no, we're nowhere near &quot;on par&quot; with the Titans. We will undoubtedly have assistance for Deathwing (this isn't debatable, they already SAID we're going to).<br />
<br />
The Titans are LEAPS AND BOUNDS beyond the Dragon Aspects. And we never killed the Old Gods, either. We simply defeated &quot;limbs&quot; of them so they could be imprisoned again. Remember that Cho'gall absorbed C'thun (he was still alive.) and the Watchers in Ulduar are in the process of reconstructing Yogg's prison.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure it's an absolutely insane &quot;last resort&quot; type of thing. The Aspects realize that we have pretty much absolutely no way to stop Deathwing &amp; the Old Gods without doing something crazy like this. I'm sure Nozdormu can mend the timeline if need be.</div></div><hr />

No one is changing the past, we are changing the future, and probably to get the result that should have happened in the first place.<br />
<br />
Maybe in the correct timeline we should beat Deathwing, but since so many things happened then the timeline has already been altered and we are just setting it right.</div></div><hr />

The infinite dragon flights whole purpose was to alter the time line so that horrible events would never happen in Azeroths history, which cause so much death and destruction. Seeing as this is the first event that we are going back in time to alter the timeline... Makes it seem like a plausible way to begin with the downfall of the Aspect of Time, which could be the Malygos of the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's what I think people are overlooking. This radical new strategy, of altering time to avert a future bad outcome, is contradictory to Nozdormu's nature. It's quite clearly the first step toward him becoming Murozond. The only real canon issue that I can think of is that, when the Titans bestowed their gifts upon the Dragonflights, they showed Nozdormu his death. He should know about Murozond.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Everything proceeds as normal, until Rhonin-A and friends go back in time to the War of the Ancients, causing Timeline B<br />
<br />
.Timelines B through C/Whatever: Pre-4.3<br />
<br />
The current timeline we're playing through, with only minor alterations each time due to fixing each attempt from the Infinite Dragonflight to ruin our lives. We go into a future--not specifically this timeline's future--taking us to Timeline D.<br />
<br />
Timeline D: Pre-Pandas?<br />
<br />
Timeline D, as seen in Dungeon 1, is the future caused by our future efforts in Dungeon 2 in the past. After we stole the Dragon Soul from the War of the Ancients, time progressed for this timeline at the same rate as ours--which meant that they had their Second War at the same time we did.<br />
<br />
This means that there was no Demon Soul for Rhonin-D to destroy and recharge the Aspects, presumably meaning that Nozdormu-D had to take... drastic measures to survive. He's latched onto the one figure at the heart of this whole affair--the one being whose reckless, wayward time travel cursed his timeline:<br />
<br />
Thrall-C.<br />
<br />
In killing Thrall-C, Nozdormu-D would be saving his entire timeline from interference. After all, even if Thrall-C went back in time and returned the Demon Soul to the War of the Ancients--or saw to it that it fell into the hands of Nekros Skullcrusher--it wouldn't be Timeline D he'd be returning it to.<br />
<br />
He'd be going back and causing Timeline E to occur and giving that particular timeline an *extra* Demon Soul to worry about, likely condemning everyone in Timeline E to oblivion too.<br />
<br />
But hey, our reality is the only one of consequence, right?<br />
<br />

A lot of people saying anagram ... learn what one is first before you start saying it is one. A true anagram reads the same forward or backwards..... This does not.... Murozond would = donozorum which isn't a correct anagram to boot let alone Nozdormu would = Umrodzon. Just thought I would point that out ....<br />

Donozorum would be a type of anagram. An anagram is any type of message, word, or name made up from scrambling the letters that make up another message, word, or name. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anagram<br />

Nozdormu becomes Murozond ONLY IN ONE TIMELINE, which may not be the original one. Maybe if we defeat Deathwing he doesnt become Murozond.<br />
<br />
Its obvious that the Titans showed Nozdormu his death as Nozdormu, since its quite clear that Nozdormu didnt knew about him becoming leader of the infinite flight till twilight of aspects, and thats because IT HEPPENS IN ONLY ONE TIMELINE.<br />
<br />
People keep forgetting that there are multiple timelines and that not everything that is show as future will actually happens.<br />
<br />
Nozdormu might never become leader of the infinite flight in our timeline. Also, if in the original timeline we killed Deathwing, there is nothing wrong in altering any time needed for that to happen.<br />

We already did this in every single CoT instance.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure this whole &quot;happens in only one time line&quot; argument doesn't make any sense, really.<br />
<br />
When he sees his death, he sees probabaly ONE death, not a million ways he could have died in a million different time lines (Cause that wouldn't be nearly as shocking as knowing how he really dies, here). When we go into CoT to keep the timeline intact, it's because the changes that would happen would happen to THIS time line, not create a separate, alternative timeline where everything went bad.<br />

No there are numerous timelines. A new timeline is created whenever someone uses time travel and changes things. Thus, we see a different outcome of things to happen. Nozdormu becoming Muozond is, obviously (hopefully) not the...&quot;alpha&quot; or &quot;true&quot; timeline. Else we'd be screwed. Like all the other CoTs we're fighting against the Infinite dragonflight, which were probably created when End Time's timeline happens. Nozdormu goes crazy after Deathwing &quot;wins&quot; and the old gods get free, and wants to stop it from happening. So he changes the past. That's why we have to go back to Hillsbrad and get Thrall out, make sure Medivh opens the Dark Portal, and that Arthas becomes the Lich King. So yea, it odes make sense for the whole &quot;it happens in one timeline&quot; arguement. :S Seriously go watch Eureka. I want to say its like the end of s2, where it really puts alternate timelines into perspective. And why time travel really shouldn't be messed with.</div></div><hr />

If altering the past just create alternative timelines, then it makes no sense for Nozdormu to go insane and then try to go back and prevent it all from happening. It already happened.

There are numerous timelines, not every single little change opens a new one. There is one original one, that must be preserved (at least the most important events must) or else all the timelines will collapse. There are numerioous other timelines, opened by changes in the events of the original (important ones) that if something is done to fix it then the timeline collapses without further problem.<br />
<br />
Read twilight of aspects before continuing the discussion, it will give you more insight on this subject as well as other importants events in Cata.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard created the world, blizzard makes the rules of it, and they make the rules of time. They explain some of the rules in the book.<br />

He thinks that by preventing all the events that lead up to Deathwing's &quot;win&quot; will change the timeline, and thus none of it happens. And that's what would happen. A time line where none of the events that we've done, or helped do will happen. Yes, it'll be an alternate time line. However, chances are the timelines will then start collapsing on each other. You do not want timelines to collapse on each other. They end up destroying one another.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc6407b04451</div><div class="date">2011-09-22, 04:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">how did deathwing die in a future where he won?<br />
<br />
Deathwing may have won the battle, but the lore implied that he was also betrayed by his &quot;masters&quot;.<br />
<br />
Think about it - although Deathwing is mad and had abandoned his task, he ist still the Earthwarden. He is still a creature created by the sworn / most hated enemies of his &quot;masters&quot; the old gods - a entity who was created to defend Azeroth together with the other Aspects against them. He still holds inside his deformed body the power of the Titans to fight his &quot;masters&quot; (and if you had read the War of the Ancient Triology - you'll know that he had already proven himself not to be a truly reliable servant).<br />
<br />
Im shure the old gods must hate Deathwing exactly the same way as they hate anything the Titans created. Of course they'll use him the destroy the entity of the Aspects and everything in the world - but they would never allow a Aspect to survive in the end (so that he maybe could use his &quot;Titan&quot;-imbued-powers&quot; against them or could become a centre of resistance).<br />
<br />
So it is only natural that they would kill him - in the second he had fulfilled his task.</div></div><hr />

Are they ghosts of some sort or what? Would be interesting to know where they came from.</div></div><hr />

Jaina as a mage stuck in mirror effect, each element seperate....sylvanas probablly in her old banshee look...and Baine might be a warrior like character since it says this aspect abandonded his power for bloodletting or w/e.... What I don't understand is why would they kill the friendly dragon aspects. Ysera and Alexstraza seem to be cooperative.</div></div><hr />
