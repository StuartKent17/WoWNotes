How the Developers Decide What Needs to Be Changed and When<br />
<br />
My previous two blogs spelled out some upcoming changes. This isn’t going to be one of those blogs. If you care mostly about WoW news, and less about the design process behind the game, then you might want to skip this one.<br />
<br />
A lot of game design is striking a balance, and I use that term not only to mean making sure that all the various classes are reasonably fair, but also to mean that it’s easy to go to one extreme or the other. You even have to strike a balance in how many changes you make. On the one extreme, if you don’t change anything, then the game feels stale and players understandably get frustrated that long-standing bugs or game problems aren’t addressed. On the other extreme, too much change can produce what we often call the &quot;roller coaster effect&quot; where the game design feels unstable and players, particularly those who play the game more sporadically, can’t keep up. I wanted to discuss today some of our philosophy on change, how much is too much, and when we think a change is necessary.<br />
<br />
First, Some Technical Background<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft is a client-server game. The servers (which are the machines on our end) handle important, rules-y things like combat calculations and loot rolls. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, it makes it much easier to share information across groups. When a rogue stabs your priest, it’s helpful for both your computer and the rogue’s computer to agree about when and where a hit occurred and how much damage was caused (and what procs went off as a result, etc.). Second, we can trust the server in ways that we can’t trust home or public computers.<br />
<br />
Over time, as our programming team has grown more experienced and picked up additional talented engineers, we have been able to make larger and in some cases bolder server updates without also having to update your client. Updating the client (the game on your computer) requires a patch. This can be a large patch, such as 4.2, which introduced the Molten Front questing area and the Firelands raids, or it can be a small patch, like 4.2.2, which fixed some bugs. Client patches are fairly involved. They take a lot of time to create and test, and they carry some amount of risk, because if we botch anything, we have to issue another client patch to fix it.<br />
<br />
Changing the game code on the server has become much easier for us. There is still risk involved, but it’s also much easier for us to fix any mistakes. We call these server changes hotfixes, because often times we are able to deploy them even while you are playing. If we hotfixed Mortal Strike’s damage, you might suddenly do more or less damage in the middle of a fight. Players sometimes call changes like these stealth nerfs or buffs if we haven’t announced the hotfix yet (or in rare cases, if we don’t intend to announce them at all). We generally can’t hotfix, at least not yet, things like art, sound or text, so we won’t for example add a new boss or swap a weapon’s art around without a client patch (though we could enable a boss that had been previously added via a client patch).<br />
<br />
I mention all of that just to explain that one reason you see so many hotfixes these days is because we have the technical ability to do so. That doesn’t mean that the game has more bugs, more boneheaded design decisions, or more class balance problems than previously. It just means we can actually fix those problems today while in the past, we (and you) might have to wait for months until the next big patch day. Overall, we don’t think it’s fair to our players to make you all wait for things that are quick for us to fix. Whether or not players are excited about the change depends a lot on the nature of the change. If we fixed a bugged class ability, that is often greeted with gratitude by players playing that class… unless the fix lowers their damage, or requires them to swap out gems and enchants to benefit from the newly repaired ability.<br />
<br />
With Great Power Comes…<br />
<br />
That’s the challenge in all of this. If your hunter is topping meters by a small fraction, you might ask: what’s the rush? And many players do. But you have to consider that other players are miffed that their raid leader might sit a warlock in the interest of bringing a third hunter (since their damage is so awesome) or might be really frustrated that they are so likely to lose to your hunter in PvP. “Necessary change” is absolutely in the eye of the beholder.<br />
<br />
We try to gather a lot of voluntary information from players, when they are cancelling their subscription for example, about why they feel the way they do. Over time, we have seen concerns about class balance decrease and concerns about frequent game changes increase. Clearly there is a risk that we can change things too much and drive players away. The rollercoaster effect of too many changes can be wearying to the community, even if each individual change is made with a noble goal. We have to balance the goal of providing fixes when we think they are warranted with the whiplash or fatigue that can come from players feeling like they constantly have to relearn how the game works. We debate constantly whether a change needs to be made immediately or whether we can sit on a problem for an extended period of time.<br />
<br />
There are no hard and fast rules that help us resolve these conflicts, so I thought it might be easier to just give you a few examples of the kinds of things we might be tempted to change in a hotfix, patch or expansion, and the kinds of things we would not.<br />
<br />
Example One: Spec Parity<br />
<br />
After looking at many raid parses, we conclude that Arcane mage damage now routinely beats Fire mage damage. (There are a lot of elements to this discussion that I’m ignoring right now in the interest of keeping the scope of the decision to something I can reasonably discuss.) For example, if Fire is better than Arcane on AE fights, that has to factor into the decision. If Fire is harder to play or if Fire is more inherently random, then that also has to factor into our decision. Even if you ignore all of those confounding issues, this is still a really tricky call. Ideally, we want players who like Fire to be able to play Fire without feeling like they are holding back their friends.<br />
<br />
The extent to which Fire can fall behind Arcane and still be “viable” is very dependent. For some players, having the two specs within 10% damage of each other is close enough. Others will swap specs for a theoretical (i.e. not even proven empirically) 1% gain. If we could make a number tweaks to Fire and be very confident that they bring Fire up to Arcane’s level, then we feel like we owe it to players to do so.<br />
<br />
There are a number of risks with this decision though. If our buffs to Fire made them more dangerous in PvP, then we’d have to be very careful about the change. If more mages going Fire meant that some utility or raid buff brought by the Arcane mages was now harder to get, then we’d have to be careful about the change. But the worst outcome, from our perspective, is if we overshoot our goals. If that happens players who like Arcane might feel like they have to swap to Fire, which might involve regemming, reforging and re-enchanting and might make them mad that they had rolled on that item that dropped last week. It just puts players in a bad position.<br />
<br />
When players talk about being on a design roller coaster, this is often what they mean. Last week Arcane was the spec to play. Before that maybe it was Frost. Next week, who knows what it will be. We’ve absolutely screwed this up before, where we thought we were creating more parity between say hunter or warrior or DK specs, but the actual result was that it made players feel like they needed to respec. Given enough time, we can get pretty close on our balance tuning, but hotfixes and often even patch changes can’t always benefit from sufficient testing.<br />
<br />
Remember, it’s not about how much damage the Fire and Arcane mage do against target dummies. What matters to players (and us) is how they do on individual encounters given a wide range of player skill, raid comp and constantly shifting allocations of gear, PvP comps, etc. We will often take larger risks when there is a major difference in play style. It’s harder to ask an Enhancement shaman to swap to Elemental than it is to ask a Demo lock to go Destro. That may not seem fair to the player who really likes Demo, but we have to weigh the risk to the game and to the player base as a whole with even small changes that appear totally safe at first.<br />
<br />
Example Two: Creative Use of Game Mechanics<br />
<br />
A lot of smart people work on World of Warcraft, but there is still no way that we can compete intellectually or creatively with the combined efforts of the millions of you. Despite our best efforts, players are frighteningly brilliant at coming up with creative solutions that never occurred to us. There are a wide variety of examples here: A player finds a very old trinket, set bonus or proc-based weapon that works really well on new content; a raid comes up with a strategy that makes a boss much easier than we intended; an Arena team finds a way to layer their crowd control or burst damage that is virtually impossible to counter.<br />
<br />
A lot of the fun of World of Warcraft is problem solving. Our general philosophy is not to punish players for being creative. We try to give groups the benefit of the doubt as much as we can. If a boss ends up being slightly easier because players group up when we expected them to spread out, or they crowd control adds much better than we thought they were able to do, then we just silently congratulate the players for being clever. If a boss ends up being much easier than intended, then we might very well take action. (Overall though, we hotfix and patch in far more nerfs to encounters than buffs.)<br />
<br />
Where we are more likely to take action is if it forces players into odd behavior, especially behavior that they won’t enjoy. If raids feel like they have to go farm really old content for a particular trinket, or if the raid feels like it has to sit six players in order to bring one particular spec who has an ability that trivializes a fight, then we’re more likely to do something. These kind of changes are really subjective and involve a lot of internal discussion. Just remember that our litmus test is usually “Are players having fun?” and not “Are they doing something we didn’t expect?”<br />
<br />
Example Three: Encounter Difficulty<br />
<br />
With encounters, the decision almost always comes down to whether to make a hotfix or not. Waiting until patch 4.3 to make significant changes to 4.2 encounters once the focus for a lot of players moves on to 4.3 isn’t necessarily development time well spent. When new dungeons or raids launch, our initial philosophy is just to get all of the nails in the board at the same height, which means prying some up to be taller and banging a lot down to be shorter. After a week or so, we hardly ever buff encounters to make them more difficult. We tend to bundle several of these changes together, often when a new week starts, so that they tend to feel like a micro patch and not just a constant stream of boss nerfs.<br />
<br />
For raids, we look at curves indicating the number of new players who beat an encounter each week. That slope tends to be steep at first as the most talented guilds race through the content, and then slows down as other players make progress. It's time for us to step in when the lines flatten out and no new players are beating the content. It’s a bit easier for the five-player dungeons because we want players to prevail almost all the time. Nobody wants to go back to Throne of the Tides week after week until they finally beat Lady Naz’jar.<br />
<br />
The statistics we look at the most are number of attempts to beat the dungeon boss, how many kills the boss gets, and how long the dungeon took to complete. Bosses such as Ozruk in Stonecore at Cataclysm launch were strong outliers. Sometimes we can handle these changes by tuning alone (lowering boss damage for instance) and sometimes we need to change encounter mechanics to the extent we can via hotfixes, which actually gives us a pretty big toolbox since almost all creature information is on the server.<br />
<br />
Example Four: Class Rotation Change<br />
<br />
There are a couple of sub-categories here: intentional and unintentional changes. Often we make fixes to make a class more fun to play. Allowing Arms warriors to refresh Rend without having to constantly reapply the debuff was a quality of life change to make the rotation a little less obnoxious to play. It also ended up being a moderate DPS buff as well. It forced Arms players to relearn their rotation slightly, but it was an improvement overall, and not too many players complained.<br />
<br />
Example Five: Overpowered Specs<br />
<br />
This would seem to be a pretty cut-and-dried case, but is one of the most controversial, because the community will never agree on when someone is overpowered or when someone is so overpowered that the developers need to step in. Being nerfed sucks. Period.<br />
<br />
Players would typically rather we buff everyone but their spec rather than nerf their spec, even if the outcome is the same. It’s totally human nature to want other specs nerfed immediately, but when it’s your own character that’s in question, you wonder: what’s all the rush, man? Again, it comes down not to the developers being cold-hearted bastards (though we are) but to whether or not players are having fun. It’s fun for you to be a one man army. It’s not fun when the one man army rolls over you. It’s fun for you to top meters. It’s not fun for when you feel like you have no hope of competing with the guy topping meters.<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that when we make class adjustments via hotfix, we want to make the simplest fix possible that addresses the problem so we minimize the risk of us breaking something else and minimize how much testing we need to do before we can deploy the change. This is the main reason we are more likely to nerf via hotfix than to buff everyone else, because it’s just fewer changes. (Remember, that if we buffed everyone up to the DPS of the outlier, that we might very well have to buff creatures as well to keep you from trivializing content, which adds a lot more overhead to the change.)<br />
<br />
I also want to point out that we virtually never make stealth class nerfs these days, at least not intentionally. It just makes players really paranoid to think their damage might change from under them. At worst, our programmers will manage to deploy a change before the community team gets it documented in the latest hotfix blog, but that situation shouldn’t usually last more than a few hours.<br />
<br />
Example Six: Exploits<br />
<br />
There is a gray area between when players know they are doing something they shouldn’t be doing and when they’re not sure if the developers would consider what they’re doing to be crossing the line. As I said above, we generally give players the benefit of the doubt. If they found something clever to do and it doesn’t give them an unfair advantage or make other players feel underpowered, then we will often do nothing, at least in the short term.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, there are a lot of bad guys out there who attempt to break the game in the name of personal profit or just because they have a malicious nature. We feel like we owe it to the other players to stomp out these abuses when they happen. Understandably, we also don’t want to publicize these changes too much. If one guy figured out a way to solo a boss to reap huge gold profits, we don’t then want to give ideas to thousands of other players by pointing out the loophole he found and how we fixed it. These also aren’t changes that we feel like we can sit on for very long. We need to get them out quickly.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to point this out because sometimes players scratch their heads about a patch note that we made to prevent or discourage exploitive behavior. “Was anyone really doing this?” is a common reaction. Just remember that by their very nature, these kinds of changes are going to be on the down low, and they need to stay that way.<br />
<br />
Example Seven: Expansions<br />
<br />
We generally save up a lot of design changes for expansions. We know even this is too much for some players who don’t want to have to relearn their character’s rotation, let alone how glyphs work or what the new PvE difficulty philosophy is. However, we feel like we ultimately have to fix the problems we perceive in the game design if we want to keep players playing the game. In this case, we think some reasonable amount of change for change’s sake is desirable.<br />
<br />
We hear from players who say “My dude hasn’t fundamentally changed in years,” and they want something, anything, that makes them look at their character in a new light. We don’t want to fix things that aren’t broken of course, but we do want to make sure that a new expansion feels all new. Expansions are opportunities to reinvigorate the player base and the gameplay itself. Therefore, you shouldn’t always view a class revamp as meaning your character is horribly broken and adrift on a sea of designer ignorance and apathy. We probably won’t ever reach a point where a particular class has reached perfection and no additional design iteration is necessary. Change, in moderation, is healthy.<br />
<br />
Stuff like this is why I say game design is an art and not a science. Given the opportunity, there is no doubt various among you who would make individual design decisions differently, and in some cases I have no doubt your decision might have been better. We’d love to see discussion on this issue though. How much change is good? When can a problem chill for a few months as opposed to needing immediate attention? How much risk should we undertake to bring small, quality of life changes? Are we on the right track? Insane? Is this just more propaganda from the Ghostcrawler Throne of Lies?<br />

Ghostcrawler seems to think that class balance complaints have decreased when in reality they haven't changed at all. People still constantly complain on the official forums about Frost Mage control as well as crazy Arcane damage in raids, meanwhile Rogue and Feral damage are through the roof in PvP and Holy Paladins are once again unkillable. The roller coaster ride continues because Blizzard has made the game more &quot;bring the class not the player&quot; then ever before. They don't bother to fix what is broken with other classes in order to put everyone on the same level. As for drastic class changes between expansions, we saw it the most with Paladins and Moonkins, and to be honest, Paladins to me are now unplayable because Retribution feels sluggish and tanking is dumb. Blizzard broke DK's in 4.1 and haven't properly addressed any of the issues the class is having either. Seems GC really needs to get out there and read what the people who aren't mouth breathing kids with down syndrome happen to be saying. When your top players in the world are quitting their classes and the game period, all because of nerfs, that should tell you something about what you did. I can understand having to make some adjustments so some classes aren't OP as hell, but sometimes it goes too far.</div></div><hr />

I agree. There is a huge part of this that is art but when it comes to game mechanics (classes, encounters, etc), it needs to be scientific/mathematic.</div></div><hr />

I don't play Alliance, thus any night elf I see doesn't stay idle/alive long enough for me to accumulate a disdain for their shoulder-rolling.<br />
<br />
can you prove 100% that every single *ret* pally wants this maybe the change....should be happy your able to dps at all i remember back when if u went ret you would be laughed at and labeled a scrub..or moron...but with all that aside this was never meant to be taken into a boohooo i want a change it was just showing you an insight into the thought process on changes and what not....go boohoo on the official forms.</div></div><hr />

Its still the same basics and considering how easy it would be to add strong features into the game now that would maybe give the more casual players intrest in playing.

The opertunities are endless. BLizzard has just not worked on those over the last 3-4 years.

<br />
BLizzard has dropped the ball in adding diffrent ideas into the game. Its pretty much exactly what is happening with every of their games. Starcraft 2 has nothing new to offer tbh. Same is Diablo 3.

And this has taken BLizzard 10-15 years... still paying devs in full doing very little new and innovative work at all. <br />
<br />
My feeling after the last 3 years ... Is that BLizzard does not have great Devs after all.

<br />
They still have 11M+ subscribers (!)<br />
<br />
Now, to put this into perspective, Trion announced recently they reached the one million mark in terms of 'accounts ever created'. This includes all trial, beta, VIP accounts, etc Add to that Blizzards statement that there are more people who have played wow and are no longer doing so than are playing wow right now. A conservative estimate would put the 'ever created accounts' well over 20M then.<br />
<br />
Long story short, Rift is an awesome game. SWTOR, guildwars 2 have potential to be really awesome games.. but if either of them tops wows subscriber numbers in 6 months I will get a figurine made out of warlock and eat it &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
edit: as for the player housing thing... do we *really* want more instanced stuff? And what would you do with said player housing? Access to your bank, a place to display trophies?</div></div><hr />

Also saying they have to be carefull not to break pvp with pve changes and breaking pvp with pve changes. But seriously look at guild wars , some skills which were hard to balance have different dmg/utility in pve/pvp. And it works perfectly.Why can't blizzard do the same? You can react faster , less QQ on forums. You can buff frost mages in pve to the same lvl as arcane but keep them not OP in pvp. You could even make sub rogues more raid viable without having them one shotting ppl in pvp.Also where are the shaman buffs? Ele and enhance needs some love , retri needs some , but ooo well lets keep them at the bottem of dps meters , as long as our mages perform excellent in pve and pvp we are all good. Rlly seperating pvp/pve tooltips of skills is the best , easiest and fastest way to balance. And it is not even confusing for the players , they just have to read , It is alrdy in the game tbh , the duration of CC on players , CS , just take it a bit further. Other than that I did like the retribution overhaul for one fact , less faceroll as wotlk. 2 rets in wotlk with same itemlvls did about the same dps, now there is some difference , more things to look at , timers , inqui , HP. Only problem you have to rely on procs for your dps , if you are lucky dps will be good , unlucky and you will be bottem dps charts. Seen loads of things that could fix retri without making them OP in pvp or pve but yet again the only changes we see is like , divine shield gets new logo , yeah great... I rlly needed that O_O</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel this to be true as well, everybody talks up how great WoW is and so its Devs must be great, all they judge it by are sub numbers.<br />
<br />
WoW has indeed only and I mean ONLY been living off its past glories, starting since its probably best production they have and will ever make, Warcraft 3 (face it SC series is only really great as an e-sport, its good for story telling too but nothing to Warcraft 3). WoW was fresh, it was never great back in Vanilla days, people only played for the experience, disregarding all numbers, they weren't important then and people could enjoy the game that way. It carried a bit into TBC and it had the best designed of the game next to (and maybe above) Ulduar's level of greatness(ulduar was actually designed long before its release). <br />
<br />
<br />
But people keep trying to give the current devs which are largely different team from Warcraft 3 and starter team for WoW the title best game Devs and put them on pedestals like that when they aren't that good at all, really, all they probably had was a good resume (and connections) to show off and awe the employers with and got hired, to do job they pretty much kick back in and have cups of coffee while they do, instead of really try to push it forward to something ground breaking.<br />
<br />
Other devs do it for so many other games, I mean who isn't a Hideo Kojima fan boy after playing MGS series? Its that passion and will to perfect your work. they spend so much time and scapegoat all the work onto micro-balancing somehow &quot;competitive&quot; PvE because there is a 1-5% difference in performance a class/spec does instead of focusing on bigger disparities or that fun factor they talk about.<br />
<br />
And no they aren't total, shit or morons, they just aren't as said above keeping up with what is becoming today's standards and been so for a while.<br />
<br />
WoW has just flourish off of its original success, it has grew off of its originally strong playerbase (exponentially) now many people ONLY play the game for the reason &quot;its where everybody else is at&quot; not because of the game as its current state at all. Can you really call it a great game, because it just has high sub count? Can you say the devs are the best MMO devs because of sub count?<br />
<br />
I think it should be judged of the % of completely/extremely satisfied players, or # people who would call it the best game ever played, most fun per time spent etc. WoW is mediocre, it is good at a lot of things, sucks at few, but doesn't excel at anything, this game has never awed me I would think, maybe except for TBC intro cinematic and prior cinematics are probably about it (not even gameplay), it has only done enough to keep me attached to it for years.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much any ret who knows how the spec works wants it. That's like asking mages who like to raid as fire if they'd like some changes to compete with arcane.<br />
<br />
<br />
....should be happy your able to dps at all i remember back when if u went ret you would be laughed at and labeled a scrub..or moron<br />
<br />
Should be happy your able to dps at all? Seriously? So it's okay if, for a hypothetical example, ret was doing half the dps of the next lowest dps in top tier content, because blizzard oh so graciously allowed them to hit things at all? Biased much?<br />
<br />
People called rets scrubs because they were driveling morons themselves. All people care about is damage meters, so that's all they look at. Ret's strength back then lied in its utility, not dps. Most people had no idea of the unique utility ret brought until the very end of BC.</div></div><hr />

Even if I'm used to some kind of rotation is fun to learn new ones. With new short talent trees leaving out choices, and abandonning path of titans, it would be nice to have something new sometimes, they could just add more glyphs or something. <br />
<br />
Even if the specs I run with my 2 classes are &quot;fine&quot; atm and can't complain much, I still check mmo-champion regulary in hope for class updates and changes. Seeing blues like this doesn't make me that excited then. And also reading again that pve fix might affect pvp, come on? We all know that seperating pve from pvp would fix this. It would be something exciting for all players, probably not so hard to learn, and we might get some actual balance for once. Path of the titans would actually have moved us in this direction, but it didn't happen. Since this is the solution to most problems, I'd rather they at least tried. <br />
<br />
Ah well, what I get from this blue is that there likely wont be much class changes in next patch so we can cross that off the list. Now what, darkmoon fairy rewards only to the none pve community? ... &quot;micro yay&quot;</div></div><hr />

For all the data we here blizzard talk about and what they can do with it. They sure can't seem to use it correctly when designing things. Be it character balance, the most recent legendary staff nerf or any number of things.<br />
<br />
There is definitely a problem with blizzard and how they take what data they do have and how they use it to design the game. After 6 years and they still can't seem to use it very effectively.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW's subscription numbers are heavily built upon a) habit, b) an 'invested' player base who have 5+ years of character history and achievements, and c) brand name recognition. <br />
<br />
If WoW was to launch today as-is, I'm not sure it would get rave reviews or be able to recapture its user base. Even with the streamlined 1-60 content, the leveling content and questing is pretty crap and I'd argue the lore has gotten worse. The end game is basically arena/rated battlegrounds, or raiding. Its got less going on for max-level characters than LOTRO or Rift as an example. And as for the subscription fee, you're basically getting a mini-patch of content every 6 months based on the current release rate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes - I can compare a a 6 year old game that has 11 million ppl paying sub for it + alot of extra money in player transfers, mounts and so on with a 6 month old game. As a true evloving MMO game - they should evolve along with tech that is awailable every time. There is nothing hard about doing that - specially considering that alot of these games are running on hubs and with instances. It would be very easy for example for BLizzard to add top quality housing with alot of fresh features. Inside you have some pets popping up running from place to place. YOu also have racks for you armor sets and chest to keep your gear and so on. Outside you could have a garden where mounts show up now and again. You could have a farming system where you will need seeds from flower pickers - and you also need fertilizer. <br />
<br />
And then there would be Guild castles - even many in each map. Comon the options are endless no matter how old the game is.<br />
<br />
No... Blizzard has failed with Cataclysm on so many fronts. Archeology for example... Good concept - horribly executed. <br />
<br />
Old is no excuse when the game is making this much income. You can justify it with games that have 100K ppl playing. But not with WOW.</div></div><hr />

Game would not be reworked in the basic current systems that are running. They would add more features that would cater to diffrent things than just grinding 5 man dungeons. There are endless chances to do this. There are huge amount of stuff that would be reused with housing for example. It would not mean another 20 gb diskspace. Neither would improving the armor system so ppl would be able to dye the gear - even change icons on cloaks and so on with help of a tailor. That way you could add current professions into the mix.<br />
<br />
Its just poor work from BLizzard. They have not kept the ball rolling on any new fronts but have kept the same team working on the same features forever. And now its too late to look back cause these things take time to develop... And they are already scrambeling to get the reused armorfeatures in... cause they were forced to add something more than just few new bosses for next patch.<br />

GW2 and SWTOR will force Blizzard to revamp WoW's mechanics in a few ways.1. Graphics2. CGD3. Content 4. Increase leveling speed or remove leveling all together.<br />
<br />
WOW will still keep the artstyle. It will need to add more flexibility tho.</div></div><hr />

I'm a feral druid and in blues I pull 16k on single target raid boss encounters consistently, and that's with moving and avoiding crap. I personally wonder why they don't see anything wrong with my class (don't get me wrong I love my numbers haha) but if I was a progressive raider and got some t12 how much would my dps spike up too? Versus say someone in similar gear? I think they just don't care anymore and just want to keep us on their leash until they give us their new MMO.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ganimah</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 04:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They still have 11M+ subscribers (!)<br />
<br />
Now, to put this into perspective, Trion announced recently they reached the one million mark in terms of 'accounts ever created'. This includes all trial, beta, VIP accounts, etc Add to that Blizzards statement that there are more people who have played wow and are no longer doing so than are playing wow right now. A conservative estimate would put the 'ever created accounts' well over 20M then.<br />
<br />
Long story short, Rift is an awesome game. SWTOR, guildwars 2 have potential to be really awesome games.. but if either of them tops wows subscriber numbers in 6 months I will get a figurine made out of warlock and eat it &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
edit: as for the player housing thing... do we *really* want more instanced stuff? And what would you do with said player housing? Access to your bank, a place to display trophies?<br />
<br />
Except that if you had read the comments from the past couple of weeks, you would have found that WoW has less than half of the subscriptions it had when it was at its peak. The quote was: &quot;There are more people that played World of Warcraft but no longer play World of Warcraft than currently play World of Warcraft&quot;.<br />
<br />
So much for the 11+ million people. WoW will still continue on...but they will not dominate like they used to. SWTOR already has in US retail box sales, alone, more than double the total pre-orders that WoW had.<br />
<br />
Just sayin'</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vengfulr3ap3r</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So this is like what, the 20th persona change that Ghostcrawler has shifted into? I guess it was easier for him to demean the customers when they had 11+ million subscriptions. But I see the conciliatory tone has started to set in, now that he realizes that his game is going to be the #3 MMO in just 6 months time. Hope he enjoyed his arrogance, while it lasted.<br />
<br />
Lol, This made me laugh. I couldn't agree more considering the persona change bit. It really is quite true when you go back and read the posts (assuming you can actually read it all and not think &quot;blah blah blah...&quot;). I mean I remember a couple months ago he was all &quot;dungeons are hard, get better or get over it&quot; and now hes all &quot;we changed this for this reason here, and we're doing this and this.. and this is why we do this!&quot; i keep seeing a mental picture of him muttering &quot;i hope more people dont leave...&quot; under his breath every time he posts a blog, lol. Maybe he suffers from a multiple personality disorder or something? :P <br />
<br />
<br />
You cannot compare a game made on 2004 with a game released on 2011, it's doesn't make sense like there will be no point in comparing a future MMO of 2017 with Rift.<br />
Technology advance in a fast pace and every year they got something new to play with, a total revamp of the game engine will end up in unbearable cost and manhours and it's probably not wise to do so.<br />
<br />
MMO recipe for success is to keep a steady but also high number of subscribers, as long as this works for Blizzard they are fine with it.<br />
<br />
Actually, They can compare it. Because wow is an active game with an active development team. I could understand your argument if they were comparing say.... elder scrolls morrow wind to skyrim because those games are pretty much set, they never change unless its through mods or explansions or something but even then it'll only be the &quot;expansion&quot; portion that gets added, bug fix's get applied nothing in the &quot;original&quot; world changes. Then i could agree with your statement.<br />
<br />
But this is an mmo, its active, they get crap loads of money via wow.... So what exactly is their excuse for not &quot;upgrading&quot; the game with the times and tech changes? money? lol go get a calculator and figure up how much money the company has made in the last 5 years and you tell me they cant afford it. Now I will admit it would get costly to upgrade the game everytime something new comes out. But considering how much money they, as a company, get via wow and wow alone. They can very much afford to upgrade hardware, or hire on new people to refine the code and what not. I mean, Wow is getting outdone by other games not because of a lack of funds, or because the times &quot;change&quot; but because the dev team got lazy. because they want to get things done with the least amount of work possible even if the result is complete and utter shit vs actually trying to fix the problem even if it makes them log more hours but the end result is spectacular or because they as a company, decided to be cheap and not upgrade their tech or something or maybe the company decided to not hire on new people even thou someone suggested they needed more people idk. Point is, they have the means to upgrade their equipment, to hire on new/more devs to help with coding, artwork etc. So they really dont have any excuse for not doing it. <br />
<br />
Take the balancing issue for example; The biggest reason i've saw for them not wanting to develop overlays to separate pvp/pve and what not is &quot;it would require to much dev time&quot; But the truth is if they spent half as much time on developing overlays, think colossal smash, as they did on TRYING to balance they would actually have pve and pvp seperated, They wouldnt spend nearly as much time buffing/nerfing crap and in turn they would have MORE time to work on content, and features. But do they? no, and its their choice. So yes, they can compare rift and wow for the simple fact blizzard has been around a lot longer as well as having much deeper pockets then trion and rift still out does wow on game play, leveling and graphics. <br />
<br />
tl;dr - They have the means and opportunity to change anything they want at any given time, but they dont, The year its released doesnt matter because they have no excuse for not keeping up with the times.<br />
<br />
<br />
Despite the fact that I dont play WoW currently.... I will eat a plate full of hats if wow becomes the #3 MMO after SWTOR and GW2 come out. Not gonna happen.<br />
<br />
Compare quality of game vs sub numbers between the three in 6 months... wow will most likely be third. That just my opinion thou.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">glycerethe</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Don't yall find it funny when they say the only way to close the gap between fire and arcane was to increase fire's damage? And then fearing fire would become OP in PEEVEEPEE? YES READ AGAIN FOLKS, they are worried FIRE would be OP for PVP! <br />
The way to close the gap was to completely change Arcane, it's a joke of a spec, it's been said million times before. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying it wouldn't be nor I'm not totally worried, but with frost so great atm I don't think anyone smart enough would go fire to 'test it out'. And while we're discussing a PvE topic, the cornerns on PvP became more important then the PvE perspective and forces the dev team to ignore on fixing/tweaking a spec that is underpowered, you are simply disappointing your subscribers. <br />
<br />
This is a PvE based game, and for you to be so worried about a non-pvp spec to become op for pvp is really something to show that this game looks like it is going to be more and more PvP based than PvE in the future.<br />
<br />
Then they go into saying that the intelligent design team couldn't out-think us, because we were able to find items/procs that would grant us powers over the intended. <br />
These stuffs are all in the game, there's no excuses, and now to actually 'out-think' us, they give us 10 times more hit points, remove old contents, so we'd never be able to use old items, or their effects will become completely trivial and they think they suceeded. <br />
<br />
What they actually did was completely ignoring a brick wall they hit, and turned away into a different direction. Blizzard will keep doing that until they realise they are trapped in a small box and ran out of directions to turn. <br />
<br />
So now, break the wall, or you can stay in this little box forever. If you don't understand what this little box means then there's no point for me to continue.</div></div><hr />

There are players who really LOVE the new ret. Because people love to be the special snowflake. Ret is so not fun, so annoying, so obnoxious to play~ most rets i know switches to a different class or spec. A lot of those left really suck.<br />
<br />
An arcane mage doing great dps? Booring theres a million of those. A ret doing that? Now that is more special. On the other hand, some rets loved the classic-ret. Judgement hitting for almost nothing, bring seal back on...10 sec of doing nothing at all...and judgement again! Well thats soo fun, right?`For every retarded version of spec, theres someone who loves it, but today ret...seriously...it sucks. ^^</div></div><hr />

As for Ghostwalker I agree with the tone. I also agree with another post which stated he lost touch with what wow is. Maybe he fears getting a thankyou note like the ceo of yahoo got from the board.... Thankyou very much for your years of service... Now get the F#%* out!<br />

Blizzard is contradicting their statement on that, you can get banned for literally anything on WoW, you can get banned for standing still in a BG even after you typed in chat &quot;bathroom, cant hold it any longer&quot; next thing you know your getting a 3 hour to 3 day ban because you had to take a whiz.in the words of R Truth, its a conspiracy!</div></div><hr />

The 11.1M current ( or at least the latest number) of subscribers is a fact.<br />
<br />
so 'people that currently play world of warcraft' == 11.1M<br />
<br />
And then your quote says that 'people that played wow but no longer play' is larger that this. Now, seeing as this group of ' have but no longer' is by definition distinct from the 'play now' group. This means the total amount of people having played plus the ones that are playing numbers over 22M.<br />
<br />
The only way your way of reasoning works is if the subscribers numbers have dropped to around 5M in the last 3 months... and I doubt that ^^ but if you have a source on that I'll happily retract my words.<br />
<br />
Also the mmo market has exploded over the last decennium, ofcourse swtor has more preorders than wow has. they are fishing in pond that has maybe 5 times the size it used to have and it's friggin Star Wars. Hell I have mine preordered.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 07:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting read, just reinforces my decision to get the hell out while the getting is good. I was a believer for 6 years, but GC and his crew have seriously messed this whole thing up since he came on the scene. He's making it far too complex and it's only resulting in the destruction of the game. Sure, casuals who don't care will always subscribe and the cutting edge raiders/PVPers will hang out and resubscribe patch to patch to insure their place in the gaming world pecking order, but what's left after that? The game is simply not much fun anymore. A month ago I would have told you I was just waiting on the next patch, but after losing half my guild and most of my long time WoW friends to other games (since Firelands is on par with watching paint dry) I made my decision to explore another title until SWTOR comes out, maybe D3 but I'm guessing that will be another Activisioned game. I totally agree with the above however, someone at Irvine had to pull his ass aside and tell him to stop being condescending to CUSTOMERS. You don't treat gamers like you would in game when you're the flipping head man in charge. I'm guessing it was someone that watches subscriptions. If you were at a restaurant and the waitperson told you &quot;that's how it is, and that's that&quot; you'd start demanding a comped meal and never eat there again. If you were a salesman telling your customer &quot;sorry, that's how we do it so like it or leave it&quot; you'd destroy your clientele base. He came on the scene when they were converting from the Vanilla/BC model to the Wrath model which is what made the game mainstream. In that time the demographic changed almost entirely and they didn't stay true to the demands of the market. Sadly I don't even want to watch Blizzcon again this year.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">[-Spiritus-]</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 10:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is a lot to take in, but what stuck me the most was the idea of class balance. Notice he only talks about class balance in terms of raw DPS? What happened to control? AoE v. single target? Burst vs. steady damage? That is the real issue. &quot;Bring the player, not the class&quot; meant that pretty much every unique aspect of every spec was washed away, with the only real difference being how and what abilities you execute for maximum damage. So now, instead of &quot;Arcane is good in X, but not as good in Y &amp; Z, Fire is good in Y, and not as good in X or Z, and frost is good in Z, but not as good in X &amp; Y&quot; you have &quot; Arcane is best at X, then next is Fire in X, and at the bottom Frost in X.&quot; When you are only balancing around X, then that 1% is the only thing that is truly separating the specs. If you had Y &amp; Z, you could say, &quot;Sure Arcane is good at X, but if you need Y, Fire.&quot; <br />
<br />
Now, was this homogenization a good move? For some, absolutely. For others, not so much. You can't please everyone, but count me in the &quot;not pleased&quot; category when specs are devolved into raw output and then encounters are designed with primarily raw, homogenized output in mind.</div></div><hr />

ROFL 22m active subs, you really need to go &quot;search&quot; for posts about the active number of players in WoW.<br />
<br />
I can tell you it's no where near what you think it is.<br />
<br />
Edit: More on topic about massive wall of blue post.<br />

WoW had it's glory days and now it's trying to still be the best when the people who made it the best are no longer around. Like EQ, GC will stuff WoW up and you can all ready seeing this happening.

<br />
So...if this is the case, let's see if the math adds up.<br />
<br />
11.1 million subscribers at 15/month = 499,500,000<br />
<br />
Total quarterly revenue for Q3 (including Cataclysm launch in China) = 313 million (http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/36351/World_of_Warcraft_Subscriptions_Continue_To_Decline_Though_More_Slowly.php)<br />
<br />
So...with box sales eating up a decent number of the 313 million quarterly revenue (not profit but total money brought in), the highest possible number of active subscriptions, assuming absolutely ZERO retail box/digital sales would be equal to 6.96 million subscriptions. Remember that taking into account ZERO retail sales...ZERO micro-transactions/guild transfers/race or faction changes.<br />
<br />
I'll stick with the math, because 11.1 million simply doesn't add up. It is more like what they have said when it's less than half of the number who used to play the game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc90f0fcd79f</div><div class="date">2011-09-11, 04:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Change, yes it's good. We like change as humans, but we also hate it when it's changed something that was pretty awesome in the first place and here is why<br />
<br />
Firstly, yes it is a balancing act, this is true. But. They are not listening or don't seem to acknowledge players demands so leaving this to chill is kinda not wise, if you speak and the listener isn't responding of course you're gonna get angry and leave, I think openly speaking about it like for example the Censure hotfix, there was a collective &quot;Yippee!&quot; from avid Retribution fanboys. <br />
Retribution has been broken for a little while and I do believe there were many posts explaining that it's inconsistent and heavily dependant on gear to even attempt viability, that's after a cut-throat guild would be prepared to theoretically carry a Paladin specced into Retribution.Another is frost mages, they are incredibly imbalanced. The point of a cloth-wearing class is to be like a glass bombs, they will do amazing damage but they are fickle... come on, they are meant to have paper bag armor yet they can kill any class. I could see originally in PvP one class/spec had a weakness to another, I could go into details but I'm sure we can pick many combos.. But now? Hm.<br />
<br />
Secondly, the worst change is I guess... we can all agree, the game seems to have change since one golden rule...<br />
It's being tailored to the masses and I mean the &quot;casual gamers&quot; mostly, the ones that play Wii and let it collect dust or randomly play iPhone/Blackberry/Samsung apps.<br />
With the segregation of Normal modes and Heroics in a more stated and obvious way compared to 10man (Normal) and 25man (Heroic)... It's paved a way to the fundamental principles or there after the lack of those today.<br />
- Major class changes, in functionality and gameplay... <br />
Warlocks though I've never played one, their remake seemed much needed and for hunters, their quiver was somewhat outdated. Removing arrows altogether... Hum, I prefer there idea of elemental-damage-based arrows to improve DPS. But, stupid things like according to Blizzard Holy Paladins were &quot;going to be not solely focus on tank healing and to be competitive at AOE&quot;, yeah, right.<br />
[2][Freddo]:LF Tank healer!<br />
[/w Freddo]: Holydin ilvl 365 <br />
Come on, who has even changed their mindset that a Holy Paladin is a raid healer, a Resto Druid to be a tank healer?<br />
War<br />
- Reducing the amount of stats and removal of said mechanics/stats that gave a class a form of uniqueness. Yes, firstly I'm talking about a few things like MP5, Armor Penetration, etc...<br />
Well I dunno about you it's nice that they've reduced the headache of sometimes balancing about 15 stats to increase output and gave us the nice little Reforge to do so... but yeah, Armor Penetration for Rogues seemed... I dunno, a no-brainer? In terms of universal idea, they are sneaky bastards that could assassinate therefore nullifying even suits of armor...<br />
- Vendor Epics<br />
I think there should be some to granted start people up, the reputation based items and the ones based on collecting tokens is great. But draw a line, how can farming a heroic be similar or at some points depending on content (Like ZG/ZA) compare to a Raid?<br />
<br />
Thirdly, Familiarity breeds contempt, this where I will say that keeping things the same is bad... and whether players know it or not, it has basically &quot;destroyed&quot; the faith in the GC and the team because well, the lore. They basically rewrote it to make ends meet such as Nefarian... Onyxia, Sinestra... and so on.<br />
People may disagree but the majority says TBC was the best part of Warcraft, and why? The story behind it. The bosses related to something and gave a sense of accomplishment, like really you progress through all the bosses in Black Temple, go through the chain of command and see Illidan, kneeling, in all his demonic glory and think &quot;Damn, I worked hard and I'm gonna be in an awesome battle to end all battles!&quot;. It was built with obvious love, time and well an underlying current. Of course Sunwell Plateau was kinda, aside to the basic tone of Illidan but it still related and to see Kil'Jaeden was at least a pinnacle to the instance... You had to bust a gut to get past the bosses to him.<br />
And so far, though alot say WHY, WHY KILL HIM? People are fond that they ARE dead. You can't reminiscent without it ending. Period.<br />
<br />
Lastly, which brings me onto another issue that , difficulty. The reason why people play a game, which contributes to the quality of the franchise's life. Let's face it, with each year they seem to dumb down games. <br />
Anyone recall arcade machines or just older games where you would spend days, weeks even months on a game? Like snake on old-school mobiles, eventually you died you would try again... Granted if its too frustrating then we do give up but... difficulty didn't die with TBC, Ulduar is an OK example, wiping on hard-modes wasn't unheard of and longevity of the content did happen but not like Firelands where... people could clear it in weeks, or a good porportion got to 6/7 Heroic. That's not difficulty... That's like just... Hey, let's farm PTR get the basics and one-shot mostly the live-bosses for some purples.<br />
We don't want to be spoon fed the game, not in the way that it is now. There should be a certain feel to progression within the character, not just a minor upgrade from one tier to another. Ok, maybe its because the glory of leveling your first level 1 has all but died as your first ding 60, 70, 80 or 85 depending on your entry to Warcraft but still, the gap between expansions is too big and the the gap between content patches seems way too small.<br />
For what we pay for compared to other MMORPGs, why are you catering for the casual gamers? They don't really play for their money's worth compared to the more &quot;veteran&quot;-based players that are on the game. Why instead of pleasing the masses with easy loot and to get people into the game quicker, make the game more interesting for those that are your core-paying customers and constantly pay.<br />
To be honest, you can argue that the systems in play such as Tier 11 being obtainable by Justice Points which can be farmed, is good for the core-payers but ask yourself, would they really be levelling alts to use those systems if they weren't dying of boredom in the first place? Make more content for individual play? Like RPGs originally are meant to be, I mean duh your genre is RPG... What role is it to AFK in Orgrimmar/Stormwind? The NPC one? No. <br />
<br />
Overall, it seems that they've tried to change the game to the point of no return and in all fairness to what GC wanted. To make it feel it's HIS game, simple. Head Developer, you do as I say and want and you deal with it.<br />
Well, sorry :\ we deal with it but you can see the profit shrink as people leave, players turning casual to soon viewing their subscriptions as a money-drain... Only a few hang in there because the communities formed there outlasts any half-mashed content you're currently wanting to put in there.. And even then, players leave so those fall and as a domino, more leave.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hypocratus</div><div class="date">2011-09-11, 07:43 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting. When about a year ago when I wrote here that GC is arrogant moron who destroys the game, most of the people were disagreed. Now, when he and his gang have successfully done it, most of the people are agree. Good, good. And I wish he said at least a word about what part of this &quot;design process for people to have fun&quot; brought those idiots to converting healing from relative fun (i had all 4 healing spec in WoTLK and enjoyed playing them) to cretinistic boring mana-watching-is-everything-enjoy-your-3-sec-heal-which-saves-nobody shit of Cata, when I didn't even level 3rd and 4th of my healers and now I play only main and only in raid. How did you come to that, idiots? I would love to read, really. And, ye, when you heal trolls in full Fireland gear it's easy, if that what you did mean by &quot;gear up and this will be fun again&quot;. I really hope this idiot finally is going to be fired.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Example : Warriors need buffing were in such a bad shape at this point in the game, that I can't even compete with other classes in the pvp scene.<br />
<br />
Now, Ask yourself what's wrong with that statement?<br />
<br />
Can't figure it out? Here let me telll you.<br />
<br />
That statement, States that the warrior class NEEDS buffing from his only perspective they need buffing.<br />
<br />
But has he taken into account not only his own skill level/experience but also his gear / knowledge of the class?<br />
<br />
So ask yourself, Before you go complaining X class is in the gutter and Y class needs nerfing is it the class? Or is it you..the player.<br />
<br />
Stop speaking for everyone else and learn to play, I mean you're telling these people who CREATED the class that they are wrong in their decision? I mean, I'm sure they know what they are doing and have the means to do what they do.<br />
<br />
I, Myself play a warrior and while I do think they need work if there is a nerf to the class it is quite possibly needed now I'm sure you won't agree with me because your in you're own little world but please, For the sake of the rest of the gaming community.<br />
<br />
Shut up and play!<br />
<br />
<br />
Cheers bro.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tehdef</div><div class="date">2011-09-12, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So...if this is the case, let's see if the math adds up.<br />
<br />
11.1 million subscribers at 15/month = 499,500,000<br />
<br />
Total quarterly revenue for Q3 (including Cataclysm launch in China) = 313 million (http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/36351/World_of_Warcraft_Subscriptions_Continue_To_Decline_Though_More_Slowly.php)<br />
<br />
So...with box sales eating up a decent number of the 313 million quarterly revenue (not profit but total money brought in), the highest possible number of active subscriptions, assuming absolutely ZERO retail box/digital sales would be equal to 6.96 million subscriptions. Remember that taking into account ZERO retail sales...ZERO micro-transactions/guild transfers/race or faction changes.<br />
<br />
I'll stick with the math, because 11.1 million simply doesn't add up. It is more like what they have said when it's less than half of the number who used to play the game.<br />
<br />
Just wanted to let you know that you are wrong. The number is 11.1 unique accounts, not subscribers. EU and NA are the biggest subscriber territories, which only account for 5-6 million iirc. The rest comes from China, which they pay to play. The basics is that you have an account, you pay for an hour to play at a lan center. That is considered a unique account that logs in, and is tallied in their total subscriber base. Please try to read the fundamentals of the details laid before you. This is critical when you are trying to form solid arguments or even baseline discussions. <br />
<br />
Thanks,</div></div><hr />

Thanks,<br />
<br />
So basically you are saying that there are over 6 million people NOT playing the game and that there are less than 5 million people still playing the game. Which, by the way, was exactly what I have been stating all along. Unique accounts don't count towards a player base, those who continue to play the game do. Technically I still have an account with Blizzard, but I have not paid them a cent in quite a long time. <br />
<br />
But I guess you were looking for some kind of odd sub-text, when the rest of us were talking about how many ACTIVE players there are left in WoW, versus your stipulation of how many total accounts there are.<br />
<br />
I guess it might be YOU who need to learn that premises form conclusions and to change the form of the premises without changing the conclusion is called a false premise. If all A are B and all B are C, then all A are C. But in your world it's seems to be ok to say: If all D are B and all B are C, then all A are C. Otherwise known as, you can't flip my argument to fit yours and I can't flip your argument to fit mine. I made a separate argument to show you different line of argumentation and somehow you missed that.<br />
<br />
<br />
TL;DR Version: The ACTIVE player base for wow is 5 million or less players. Confirmed not only by quantitative argumentation, but also by citation of sources and confirmation from the devs.</div></div><hr />
