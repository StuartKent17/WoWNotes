Heals Efficiency<br />
<br />
The big heal doesn't have to be super inefficient. It just has to take more mana than the efficient heal, but that's okay because it also heals for more. You use the big heal when it's faster than using two of the efficient heals. That only really makes it inefficient when you're overhealing a ton.<br />
<br />
Your fast heals will be the inefficient ones, because you pay more for speed. Don't spam those, but use them when you don't have time for a long cast before damage will happen next.<br />
<br />
If you're a druid healing a tank, you'll probably use Lifebloom, then Nourish, swapping to Healing Touch at times when the tank's health starts to dip dangerously low. You probably won't cast Healing Touch often on non-tanks, unless they're just super low for some reason (and in those situations, you may need a fast heal like Regrowth or Swiftmend to get them stable anyway). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24630603049/healing-touch/))<br />
<br />
Healing in Cataclysm<br />
We don't want druids in Cataclysm to be tabbing through the raid throwing out random Rejuvs like many druids do now. Frankly, we don't think it's that fun and we know plenty of druids agree with us.<br />
<br />
That also doesn't mean that hots are going away. We like hots to be a big part of the druid arsenal. We just don't want them to eclipse all your other heals. It's easy to point out specific things like glyphs and set bonuses that have given Rejuv in particular so much leverage. That's fine for now, but not where we want to be in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
I also agree that hots risk being overpowered in an environment where they aren't overhealing constantly. In a world where players spend more time being wounded, hot ticks will be enormously important. That's okay to a point. We want you to push them. But we don't want such a large percentage of your healing to come from one spell. We don't want Rejuv to win the decision every time you're thinking about whether to cast say Nourish or Regrowth instead.<br />
<br />
To think about it another way, druids already have a pretty different rotation when tank healing than when raid healing. What we want to do is further split out raid healing into situations where players are occasionally taking damage and situations where everyone is constantly taking damage from raid-wide auras. You should use different types of spells in those situations -- maybe WG and many Rejuvs in the latter, but more Nourishes and Regrowths thrown in there with Rejuv on the former.

Tanking Glyphs<br />
We're still working on the Inscription design for Cataclysm and it may end up changing a lot.<br />
<br />
If it doesn't change, then I am going to predict we do something like remove the Glyph of Last Stand (and lower the cooldown base or through a talent) and keep the Glyph of Shield Wall. The Shield Wall glyph is mildly interesting in that sometimes you want it and sometimes you might not. We don't think it's unreasonable to have to spend some glyphs on survivability, since presumably that's what is most important to you. But maybe you're spending too many glyphs on cooldowns today.

If you can come up with an arguement saying that its all a fake for comming out soon then please point me in that direction as honestly if you look at the signs from Tbc and wotlk release it is quite evident there will be an imminent release of the beta in the trademarked &quot;soon&quot; that blizzard have developed.<br />

I'm trying not to get too crazy about it, because I know &quot;some love&quot; could mean just about anything. I mean, I knew we'd have more revamped dungeons, as people have not only been clamoring for it, but it would be easier than starting from scratch for Blizzard. Of course, it could also simply mean the gear that drops from those places will be changed around to better reflect the leveling process, or that they're being nerfed so that it's more viable for lower levels to progress through there. I'm just glad they're doing *something* with them, rather than letting them rot.<br />
<br />
As for PvP flagging on PvE realms, I specifically joined a PvE realm because I hate ganking. Hell, I hate that people attack me while I'm fishing in Wintergrasp, and I'm right next to the graveyard! So the idea of having to daily quest in a PvP zone was very frustrating to me. I know some will be frustrated with the non-flagging outside of battle, but isn't the battle itself enough PvP for you? If it's not, then join a PvP server.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragingsoul</div><div class="date">2010-05-02, 02:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">what they fail to see with druid's healing is the other side on things.<br />
<br />
On fights where everyone is taking constant dmg, hots are maybe too powerful, but in a fight where the aoe is on the whole raid, for a short time, hots are the most inefficient way to heal, mana wise. <br />
<br />
If a boss does a 3 sec aoe on the whole raid ( take fire boss in VOA for example) for your hots to tick at this point, you need to PRE hot the raid, hence some players will have 80% overhealing. for reju to tick on 10 players while the aoe is going, you need to spend 10 gcd, so 10sec minimum at the haste cap in advance. <br />
Now I'm fine with that, it takes more skill, and makes you plan in advance for what will come next, but if they want to see the healing role more in a mana efficient way, then something has to change. <br />
<br />
I also love the comment on tank healing. &quot;the tank's hp is really low, you'll use healing touch'. Yeah, if the tank is low on health, it means his seconds are counted, let's use the most powerful spell, more demanding spell (up to here I'm fine) and also the most long casting spell (there I don't agree). The chances the tank will die are higher with casting a long spell, than casting a smaller one, but less powerful one. Now if they want us to use longer casting spell and say tanks won't die, then the remove the death out of the equation completely. if the tank at low hp isn't in a need of a fast heal, but a powerful long one, when will he ever be in a danger to die?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's 100% certain they will fix the loot in the old 5-man dungeons to make the items worthwhile during leveling, and maybe tweak some quests, but it's highly unlikely that they will change any actual contents too much except to clean up some idiot instances, removing few trashmobs... Maybe split Stratholme, BRD and BRS into 2-3 wings, retune BRS into 5-man dungeon and things like that. Those old huge lv60 instances should be splitted into wings to make them flow properly with the LFD system.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, if the tank is low on health, it means his seconds are counted, let's use the most powerful spell, more demanding spell (up to here I'm fine) and also the most long casting spell (there I don't agree). The chances the tank will die are higher with casting a long spell, than casting a smaller one, but less powerful one. Now if they want us to use longer casting spell and say tanks won't die, then the remove the death out of the equation completely. if the tank at low hp isn't in a need of a fast heal, but a powerful long one, when will he ever be in a danger to die? <br />
<br />
<br />
I think the plan is for tanks to be able to survive long enough for the option for that big heal to be cast, and if it doesn't overheal, to be the most mana-efficient thing healers have. I know it's hard to remember after a whole expansion, but everyone, tanks especially, are supposed to have a lot more HP to work with, and live longer, to the point were we have to worry about mp management, and not so much about spamming before the tank goes from full to 0 in seconds. Casting the most efficient heal to match the situation will matter again, supposedly. If we don't, I've heard we run the real danger of running out of mp. Remains to be seen, but it sounds like what Blizzard wants it to be.</div></div><hr />

Hell, I hate that people attack me while I'm fishing in Wintergrasp, and I'm right next to the graveyard! So the idea of having to daily quest in a PvP zone was very frustrating to me. I know some will be frustrated with the non-flagging outside of battle, but isn't the battle itself enough PvP for you? If it's not, then join a PvP server.<br />
<br />
+1 I've spent a lot of money while transfering to PVE and I don't want to hear now that I will not be able to forget about thouse people who create their chars for only one purpose - don't let you comfortly playing, lvling and questing... When I was whining about ganking you said &quot;Go go to crappy PVE server, noobby cower&quot;... So, I'm transfered cuz I realized that I'm not a PVP player...

While I think that Blizzard may have more planned than that for old world instances, I agree that loot redesigning will get the most attention. (ex: mail dps armor to not have int in cataclysm)<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
That's because they address every concern except the one that keeps being voiced - that warriors are vastly inferior at picking up slowly spawning adds because of the gaps in the AOE rotation. Even something like adding enough threat to Demo Shout to actually get mobs attention would be fine, but instead we get buffs to devastate, a fix to thunderclap, nerfs to shield slam and concussion blow, and buffs to revenge.<br />
<br />
The point is, they could make thunderclap do five billion damage and infinity plus five threat, and it still wouldn't address the concern warriors are voicing.<br />
<br />
So it's not so much that warriors are &quot;QQ&quot; constantly, it's that we have one major complaint that just isn't addressed.<br />
<br />
Is it gamebreaking? No.<br />
<br />
Is it a quality of life issue that we feel makes us measurably inferior to other tanks in certain situations that occur at least once per raid tier?<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Are you now going to scream and froth about QQ and completely ignore my statements, telling me to gtfo and warriors are fine at AOE tanking, which isn't the complaint at all?<br />
<br />
Probably.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love the idea but I'm just affraid of the execution.<br />
BRD, Scholomance, Stratholme. Exactly the instances that made WoW epic back in 2004.<br />
<br />
If you compare them to BC / WoTLK instances, yes they may sometimes be confusing, but hell, these are epic masterpieces. Unlike BC/WOTLK dungeons, these are not straight corridors. BRD is a real city with real rooms that have real history / real functions. Alson, cutting them in wings would be really bad honestly, because you won't get the cohesive feeling of a single building / complex... <br />
<br />
Please Blizzard: be careful. Don't ruin some of the last epic pieces that remain in this game...<br />
I think I'm going to shoot some FRAPS of areas / dungeon, before Cataclysm, to get something to remember the good old days :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
You need to take this information along with what has been said previously about healing. It's not going to be so whack-a-mole where you only have a global cooldown to get people back up. A tank will be able to get low enough to make using Healing Touch worthwhile without being in danger of being gibbed if you don't get that heal off in the next 0.5 seconds. It's a whole no approach to healing that will be more thoughtful and less spammy. You won't have the mana to heal like you do now.</div></div><hr />

Oh, and to those complaining about how going to Tol'Barad on a PvE realm won't auto-flag you for PvP... just flag yourself. That way, if you want to world PvP there, people can gank you and you can have your fun that way.

lol at guilds breaking up for a mount. <br />
<br />
It's a rare mount, a pleasant surprise when it drops. They didn't put it in there so that you could farm it (back in classic), it was an extra reward for clearing the dungeon. Sure people can farm it now if they want, but they shouldn't complain about the droprate should they choose to do so.</div></div><hr />

TM/SS battles never lagged badly on my server, and for those who participated they were VERY epic battles that would last for hours. Also, what was tedious about them? You got there to fight the Horde/Alliance, to prove your faction is the stronger one, to score as many kills as possible so you could tell others back in IF/Org of your deeds in the field of battle.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you didn't like them because you never actually got any &quot;reward&quot; from doing them? <br />
<br />
Well they offered a reward far greater than honour or arena points, they offered a LOT of fun. Something which seems to be very rare in the game these days.</div></div><hr />

If people don't want to PvP then don't FORCE them into a situation where they have to PvP. I wish they did this with WG from the beginning.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not sure why people play WoW's carebear PvP anyways if they really want PvP. Not like they haven't been killing world PvP anyways.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Funny thing is us PVE only players outnumber you by a long shot.<br />
<br />
Funny how most of the PVP realms are low or mefium pop at peak hours yet most PVE realms are high and full at peak hours.<br />
<br />
Kind of shows your precious PVP is not as popular as you like to claim it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ummm 300k isn't really that much of a long shot.....<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ah. Look. You must be one of those people whom reminisce on Tarren-Mill/Southshore as 'epic' where it actually was a 'lagfest', and BRM during peak hours as 'fun' where it was 'tedious'.<br />

Since day one it's been like this. Every god damn expansion druids need to be reinvented... For the ppl who think rejuv is boring. Like playing nourish/regrowth with the raid frames isn't boring? Pala healing maybe. I dunno what it when i look at other drids in icc25 i only see WG being spammed for more than 40% of the time like you don't have better spells for the situation??? and then you complain healing is boring. No you choose it to be boring.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Calaba</div><div class="date">2010-05-02, 10:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">WG isn't used as a daily quest hub re: Isle of Quel'Danas/Argent Tourney, so TB is dramatically different in that sense.<br />
<br />
Not really. When Wrath launched, WG was THE daily quest hub. ok, sure, there were a few daillies elsewhere; hodir rep and cooking /fishing quests, etc, but... well... you get the idea, originally you could do wintergrasp quests daily, and the Argent Tourney just wasn't there. <br />
<br />
Still, WG has only ever really had 1 PvE quest available each day (farming elementals for ermmm.... arrows etc), it looks like TB will have a few more, but it won't be more than 6 or 7 at most (there never is, it's to keep gold level/inflation down probably). And I'll bet TB will have a number of PvP quests anyway (kill x players in this zone will be one for sure). <br />
<br />
So, yeh. don't expect every daily in TB to be PvE. I doubt they'd make a &quot;PvP zone&quot; and then leave out the daily pvp quests.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pasture</div><div class="date">2010-05-02, 11:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason is simple:<br />
<br />
World PvP died already a millenia ago, and you can do the typicall BGs/Arena on PvE realms, too. TB was an attempt to fix world PvP - but its going to be another failure, in a PvPers point of view.<br />
<br />
I don't see the problem. I rolled a PvE server because I don't like World PvP. I want to be able to quest and farm in peace. When I want to PvP I go Arena or hit some BGs. If you want world PvP, join a PvP server and TB will still be PvP enabled for you. The servers are there for a reason. Choose which suites you best. Don't complain when they make a change to a server not designed with World PvP in mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, if you don't like it, reroll a priest. druids owned at raid healing in BC, spamming Lifebloom on a raid grid, after a huge aoe you'll beat anyone, don't go around saying oh, we're changing this and that because we don't think its fun, that in a sense, saying &quot;well... warlocks don't really like to have to tab target to put dotts on people. so we're gonna lessen the amount they use them.&quot; <br />
<br />
Druids, from Vanilla to BC were all about the hots, now with Wotlk and cat, you're gonna lessen the need for them, this is why old school players quit, you're changing the core part of the class.. just because a few retards who play a druid should be playing a priest. its pretty simple to understand.</div></div><hr />

And as you people read earlier - I think i'll stick with the third answer for $800, Alex.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
TM/SS battles never lagged badly on my server, and for those who participated they were VERY epic battles that would last for hours. Also, what was tedious about them? You got there to fight the Horde/Alliance, to prove your faction is the stronger one, to score as many kills as possible so you could tell others back in IF/Org of your deeds in the field of battle.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you didn't like them because you never actually got any &quot;reward&quot; from doing them? <br />
<br />
Well they offered a reward far greater than honour or arena points, they offered a LOT of fun. Something which seems to be very rare in the game these days.<br />
<br />
<br />
Those BRM battles being tedious wasn't about being rewarded for them or not. It's all about me and 39 other people getting frustrated with a raid being delayed for over an hour, by being forced into combat people did not wish to engage in.<br />
<br />
By the way, for those of you who want to get into semantics as 'lulz, but tats whuz wirld pvp is about' - no, it's not. It was just like getting ganked while farming materials in the open world, but on a larger scale.<br />
<br />
And 'ganker' rhymes with 'wanker' for a reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's what I wanna see in a few dungeons:<br />
<br />
1. Stratholme: Upgraded to post-WOTLK. Rivendere is dead and the Scarlet Bastion is abandoned by the Paladins and Centaurions who held it since most of their leaders were killed by adventurers in Northrend and two Dreadlords were found within their ranks. The Argent Dawn and the Cenarion Circle make their move and take part of Straholme, which is used as a base camp for Alliance and Horde adventurers. The Argent Dawn are working to evict the pockets of Scourge still holding the city while the Cenarion Circle hopes to purge the land of its corruption. The city still instanced but a few parts no longer are.<br />
<br />
2. Scholomance: Although Adventurers defeated the leaders of the School of Necromancy, surviving members of the Cult of the Damned return the Scholomance, converting it into their new stronghold. Like Arthas, they believe the new Lich King to be biding time and when he returns, he will pick up where his predecessors left off. Of course, the Argent Dawn have a problem with this (LOL). The Alliance friendly Camp at Chillwind makes their move and sets up a forward camp at Sorrow Hill with Uther's Tomb as the rallying point. Meanwhile, their Horde friendly counterpart takes Felstone Field. Backed by the Forsaken, they're forced to deal with two foes at the same time: The Scourge Remnants to the East and South and the remnants of the Scarlet Crusade to the north in Hearthglen... <br />
<br />
3. Blackrock Depths/Thaurissian: It's been revealed the Dark Irons' Emperor Dagrin Taurissian ensured his people would both endure and be equal in the eyes of the Bronzebeard Dwarves--he impregnated Moira Bronzebeard. As the mother of the next Emperor of the Dark Irons she renounces her claim to Ironforge's throne in favor of the Dark Iron Empire. Remarkably, this results in peace between the Three Hammers for the first time in centuries as Magni is unwilling to commit troops to remove the new Dark Iron Empress. Moira in power may have suddenly stabilized the region but there are those who seek to incite a new war between the Dwarven Kingdoms. Muradin Bronzebeard, thought dead in Northrend offers quests to Alliance and Horde Adventurers at Thorium Point in the hopes of exposing a conspiracy brewing in Blackrock Mountain.<br />
<br />
4. The Stockade: The Defias Brotherhood is nothing more than a minor footnote. Thanks in no small part to vilgilant citizens of the Alliance, of course. It's been a year since King Varian Wrynn returned to power and pockets of the once-powerful criminal organization are urge the populace to oppose their King. For the second time in three years, prisoners riot in the Stormwind Stockade only this time, they've taken Prince Anduin Wrynn Hostage. The riots have sent to demands to the Keep but Varian's never been one to settle what could otherwise be handled with the point of a sword...<br />
<br />
5. Zuk'Farrak: The Darkspear Trolls reclaimed the Echo Isles off the coast od Durotar. Rather than involve himself with the politics threatening to tear the Horde asunder, Vol'Jin seeks to turn rival Troll factions into allies. He sends emissaries to villages and Troll cities across Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms to meet with their leaders but the ancient Kingdom of Zul'Farrak holds a particular interest to the Darkspears. Emissaries from the Echo Isles await brave adventurers of the Horde in Gadgetstan willing to challenge the powertful empire on their own terms, the reward untold fame and honor amongst the Darkspear Trolls.<br />
<br />
6. Razorfen Downs/Kraul: Thanks to the vigilant efforts of brave adventurers, the Scourge presence was destroyed before it could become too great a threat. When the Alliance captured Camp Taurajo, they set their sights on wiping out the Quilboar once and for all.<br />
<br />
I got more later ^_^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then why did you roll on a PvP server if you do not enjoy the large-scale battles between raid groups at a dungeon entrance? We would have canceled our raid and engaged the opposing players instead (because in Classic, raids weren't just all about &quot;OMPFGGG GOGOGO no time to waste&quot;) Perhaps you should have rolled on PvE?</div></div><hr />

No, they're responding to the whiners. They regularly respond to them with &quot;Fuck off, warrior tanking is fine.&quot; which is what you want to hear. So what's the problem?

TM/SS battle was awsome, dont know why your crying for, go to the pve server if you want to play care-bear mode. Its people like this they added dishonorable kills. You dont like that people actually enjoyed it tough shit, you got your way already and destroyed world pvp when it was fun, and not forced.</div></div><hr />
