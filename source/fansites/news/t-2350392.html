I myself am neutral to his departure. This game ain't a one-man enterprise, and I always hope that they'll do better with class designs and balancing... although, they hit the sweet spot with many already during MoP, RIP...</div></div><hr />

wow's problem with &quot;balance&quot;. is something the guy never quite grasped<br />
He never understood given how many classes/specs wow has, the balance he sought was never<br />
going to happen. how Classes interacted and counteracted with each other was much more important.<br />
Given how much of the new expansion is going to be about PVP there is no way he would have remained.</div></div><hr />

<br />
WoW isn't dying. It will never die unless Blizzard specifically retires it. There will always be millions of players. There has yet to be a &quot;WoW killer&quot; MMO that survives, let alone beating player count. WoW is the iPhone of MMOs. You're free to have your opinion about it, but it will never go away through lack of users.</div></div><hr />

I dont know what youre seeing, but look thru his twitter &amp; tell me how much WoW you see in it. Yes, he communicates about random other things that have nothing to do with his job.

<br />
I myself am neutral to his departure. This game ain't a one-man enterprise, and I always hope that they'll do better with class designs and balancing... although, they hit the sweet spot with many already during MoP, RIP...<br />
<br />
Considering that he didn't know what he was doing, I don't think people are going to be saying this in a few years. I will never get over his insisting that MM and SV hunters were playing fine during the WoD beta despite many protests from the hunter community. He was finally hounded into running dungeons on the beta as MM...and he had to go ask on a stream what the rotation for the spec was. And then after he talked about how fun it was to multi-shot weave or something that wasn't even a thing you did as MM. I'd say maybe the monks will miss him, since he'd actually like talk to them, but I don't think even the monks are all that happy with monk design atm, so...</div></div><hr />

Every interaction I'd had with him was dreadful, a complete lack of knowledge on his end over some pretty stupid subjects to be clueless about combined with a dreadfully snarky tone in his responses.<br />
Celestalon singlehandedly made me stop giving feedback on the game.<br />

Never had a reason to be anything but greatful to the staff on WoW and their devs / blue posters have been nothing but helpful, but Celestalon's the one guy I can't stomach.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My thoughts exactly.<br />
<br />
For the record I hardly believe any individual in this thread thinks he is solely responsible for any class changes, however, he has been the &quot;face&quot; of many of them. I don't know employee #37's name that brought up Warlock change #13 in WoD, however I do vividly remember Celestalon's horrible interface with the Warlock community. I vividly remember seeing on twitter &quot;So you want to continue being overpowered? Understandable...&quot; in response to KJ criticism. I remember &quot;Yeah, I don't get it. Demo is not OP; Aff/Destro are OP (in PvE). Thus, top guilds' Warlocks are mostly Aff/Destro&quot; without acknowledging their &quot;OPness&quot; came from trinket design. I remember his blatant disregard for cold hard facts with a blanket statement of &quot;That's not what our numbers say&quot;. I remember a lot of very unsavory things from celestalon... So I will say based on that, he can kindly fuck off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering the balance issues, especially in PvP the last few expansions, this alone speaks volumes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good. It was clear to me he lost his passion for WoW a long time ago.<br />
<br />
My thoughts exactly. Celestalon's early days were really good. He seemed enthusiastic, passionate about his role and actually engaged with the community on more than a superficial level. He even had some early successes that boosted his popularity. That didn't last more than a year though as it didn't take long to show he didn't seem as good at the whole balancing and numbers thing as he was cracked up to be. The last two expansions has been a hot mess when it comes to class balance and when his blunders became more well known, Celestalon like most other devs barricaded himself behind social media only replying to the handful of people that still worshipped him. Clearly he wasn't up to the task and I am surprised he lasted as long as he did before being quietly shipped off to the wings like Holinka.<br />
<br />
Unlike Holinka though, I cannot help feel a little sorry for the guy though because at least he seems decent enough person outside of his role. I just feel he was given too much responsibility too soon and didn't really know how to learn from his failures after his early success. Maybe HS will be more his forte though considering what a trainwreck that game is when it comes to balance as well, I hope he isn't jumping from one vat of boiling oil to the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard essentially makes between $300-500 million annually (profit) from just sub fees in wow (before taxes and depending on subs, $300m would be less than 3m subs, $600m would be more than 6m subs). These sub revenues are essentially seen as free money, they don't really have to work more or less to get it. <br />
<br />
Even if an expansion would cost around $100 million per 12 months, at a sub rate of $12.99 and 3 million subs, they'd still make $367 million profit annually.</div></div><hr />

Warlocks are a prime example. Destro was garbage for a while. Demo once you move there goes most of your dps. Affliction is fine surprisingly.<br />

Thinking yourself to be omnipotent and calling other people(arguably some of the best in their class) bad while not even knowing the rotations for that class is like.... so fucking stupid.<br />

I just feel he was given too much responsibility too soon and didn't really know how to learn from his failures after his early success. Maybe HS will be more his forte though considering what a trainwreck that game is when it comes to balance as well, I hope he isn't jumping from one vat of boiling oil to the other.<br />
<br />
I find it hard to have sympathy for someone like Nervig, who liked to use very loaded language and snark when responding to paying customers. He earned the comments now he's leaving. <br />
<br />
Maybe he'll be a benefit to the Hearthstone team, maybe he won't, I don't really care, I'm not invested in that game. But going by the total fuck up of the balancing team in Legion, this is a needed change. He's one of those guys who needs to stay off social media, honestly. He just rubs people the wrong way. He's like that one IT guy who, while good at his job, leaves you wanting to punch him in the face after dealing with him face to face, because he just doesn't have any social skills and is beyond obtuse.</div></div><hr />

Facts checker: <br />
<br />
Hazzikostas initially chose the name &quot;Watcher&quot; because he needed a name for his character to watch Ulduar raids on the PTR.<br />
<br />
Jeffrey Kaplan (alias Tigole). Jeff was hired by Blizzard because of his status as Tigole, guild leader for Legacy of Steel on The Nameless server of EverQuest, and his rants on Sony Online's handling of endgame content In EverQuest made him a celebrity In the EQ community. <br />
<br />
Tom Chilton (aliases Kalgan and Evocare), his ingame nickname from ultima online.<br />
<br />
Chris Metzen has used the alias &quot;Thundergod&quot; in multiple online venues.<br />

So far just ingame nicknames from wow or other games.</div></div><hr />

These sub revenues are essentially seen as free money, they don't really have to work more or less to get it. <br />
<br />
Even if an expansion would cost around $100 million per 12 months, at a sub rate of $12.99 and 3 million subs, they'd still make $367 million profit annually.<br />
<br />
the calculation you made is an upper limit. Subscription cost is not the same everywhere, for example Argentina (in latin america) pays 120 ARS, with the current conversion rate that is near half of that, and the cost in south america has always been below that (well I am not sure about Chile and Colombia, they are always more expensive).</div></div><hr />

SA subs won't bring down the price much, in 2011 blizzard said there were around 100k subbed players in SA compared to around 5.6 million in NA/EU and around 3.8 million in all Asian regions combined. We also know that they said the majority of the drops are always in Asian regions, and NA/EU are generally stable.<br />
<br />
My 3 million example was only based of NA/EU region as that's where over 70% of the wow income is generated.</div></div><hr />

Let the unpruning begin<br />
<br />
He was right, after 6 expansions the classes were getting buried under new abilities and unknown combinations of talent points, became a nightmare to balance bosses around. May not feel good to you but for the health of the game things had to get pruned back. But of course you are incapable of seeing it from a game designers point of view and only take your own point of view into mind when it comes to the game.<br />

WoW's classes weren't originally designed around either of what we today call PvP or PvE. WoW's classes were designed with inspiration drawn from Warcraft 3 units and heroes, and they were intended to immerse you in the life of that particular unit/hero in the context of the Warcraft universe. World of Warcraft was fundamentally about exploring the world of the Warcraft games from a new perspective. There was even more material for this than we know of, given that Warcraft 3 was originally supposed to be an RPG more than an RTS, but this was changed mid development.<br />
<br />
It wasn't until around 2002 that the Everquest crowd came into the WoW dev team and, with their understanding of what Everquest had done right and what it had done wrong, created the PvE focused open world game that we know and love. However, before this, most of the classes had been settled, their core fantasy and toolkits decided, the races were decided, most of the capitals created (they were overhauled later though), and the decision of having 2 factions also came before this time. All of these things make WoW a strong PvP game.<br />
<br />
Since Warcraft 3 was a competitive game, and the classes were designed with inspiration from it during a time before the open world PvE game was settled on, WoW's classes turned out to be rather fun to PvP with. Furthermore, since the overall game had little direction then, the overall class design reflected &quot;what would a character of this type do in their every day grind in the world of warcraft&quot;. The game was also originally supposed to have all 4 continents at launch, but much, much fewer quests - somewhere in the hundreds - like 1-2 quests per zone, literally. The level cap was supposed to be 70 as well. Northrend never got far, but Outland was 1 zone for 60-70 players, and same applies to the Dragon Isles, which still aren't in the game today. The core of the game was to be faction conflict and player interaction in a huge open world.<br />
<br />
However, when the EQ guys took over, they refocused the game to be more like Everquest and started developing raids. Onyxia's Lair was added a few days before the game shipped, and Molten Core was developed in one week last minute. Thus the game was made PvE focused, but developed on a strong PvP foundation. Blizzard decided to offer 2 realm types, recognising that some people wanted the open world PvP experience originally planned, whereas the Everquest crowd wouldn't like it. In 2005, Blizzard added the honor system, and then BG's, and the PvP part of the game started to shine.<br />
<br />
The origin story of WoW is complex, but suffice to say was neither a PvE game nor a PvP game. It was an open world RPG game first with end-game PvE and PvP tacked on.<br />

<br />
While I certainly appreciate the background, I'm not really sure what the point is of this post. I mean, games develop. Diablo was originally going to be turn based, but would I ever say that that's what the games INTENTION was therefore real time is bad? No, because again, games develop. Diablo became Diablo because of the development process and going through more then one persons hands. It's inevitable when you have so many people working on one single thing.<br />
<br />
The game was released with two opposing factions, with both PvP servers and PvE servers. The released product is the intended product, its when the devs say &quot;this is what we made&quot; and put their final stamp on it. That's a pretty strong intention if you ask me. The case is made right away for validation of both PvE and PvP, and what I see far too often on the forums are PvE'ers trying to say that PvP needs to go away forever. You simply can't have half your subscribers doing a thing, and then completely dismiss it as a &quot;mini game&quot;, when for those people it's the entire reason they play the game at all. It's flat out ignorance, not to mention it only hurts PvE at the same time. Push out half the subscribers, and now you have half the budget.<br />
<br />
Look at all the WoW videos from Vanilla, they're all world PvP videos. It what garnered a lot of attention to the game in the first place. I'd argue this entire time Blizzard has failed to capitalize on this concept from the very beginning, and the move towards arena-only based PvP system is what has been eroding the strengths of the PvP game. I mean, I tried to watch the WoW arena finals at Blizzcon, I think there were like 12 people watching. No one cares about arena. But this is an entirely different argument all together.<br />
<br />
My point is, almost nothing in life came from its very first original design, it comes from iteration and evolution. Then after that it falls on those designers to either take advantage of that, or miss out. PvP was extremely popular through to the end of MoP, then Blizz failed to capitalize on those players for WoD and on, so they left in mass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason arena is so unpopular currently is twofold: 1. the classes haven't been fun to play since MoP (ability pruning), and 2. the rewards suck.<br />
<br />
The people who are really into PvP all quit because of 1, and the masses that just did their 10 games per week for gear stopped participating because of 2.<br />

I personally believe they pruned the classes because it was their attempt to contain the arena game and make it more &quot;esports friendly&quot;. I mean, with Legion we saw the rollouts of even more pruning and PvP talents and templates. <br />
<br />
I also believe most people only did arena because of the rewards, and if the rewards weren't there they'd choose to play something else. (Though obviously I understand there are people who are hardcore arena junkies, the real question is just how many exactly?)<br />
<br />
Btw, I agree, the classes are super boring and entirely why I no longer PvP.</div></div><hr />

Think through this carefully, because there's a contradiction in your views:<br />
<br />
If most people are only doing arena for the rewards, then it makes no sense at all to dumb the classes down for the arena players.<br />
<br />
In fact the entire arena community has been very vocal and outspoken against the pruning. From top players like Cdew, multi-glads like Tosan, and average joes and janes like me. We are all united against the pruning. In fact the Celestalon Tablet meme even originated on a thread on the US arena forums.<br />
<br />
During the beta there was a megathread on the beta PvP forums about how the ability pruning was absolutely ruining PvP gameplay. Watcher himself came down and made some stupid comments which proved he hadn't paid any attention to PvP since he was a duelist shaman in Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
We were hardly the target audience for these dumbed down classes... we absolutely hate them and can't stand them.<br />
<br />
The classes weren't dumbed down for the sake of hardcore WoW players who have played for over a decade. They were pruned and dumbed down to try to keep a higher proportion of first-time subscribers to stick with the game instead of giving up because they don't want to put in the effort required to learn how to be raid viable.<br />
<br />
It's all PvE driven. The original explanations for the first round of pruning (WoD) was entirely PvE driven. &quot;Make the game more accessible for new players&quot;. &quot;Make classes easier so we can focus on developing more challenging encounter mechanics&quot; (what are the implications of that for PvP where the classes themselves are the encounters?)<br />
<br />
One of them even told me on Twitter &quot;we felt like we had to prune Remove Curse from Mages because a new player could get yelled at in a dungeon for not pressing it, and that could feel bad for that person&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it does, because the goal was to bring in more players overall. That's usually the logic behind dumbing games down in the first place, to make it more accessible. When I say they tried to make the game more &quot;esports friendly&quot; I mean it through their false idea of &quot;esports friendly&quot;, which really is just dumbed down for mass consumption. When dev's talk about esports, rarely do they talk about genuine game design that compliments it, it's usually more about how to get people to watch, and thats all that matters to them. <br />
<br />
Eyeballs &gt; all.<br />

<br />
Exactly, because the hardcore are the minority (which is true) but in their old outdated view the believed that a small sacrifice from the top would bring more interest to those on the bottom, and thus overall an increase in participation. And they seem to now be seeing that that view has cost them, because without reason to climb to the top there is no bottom (or even a purpose). The only way to know if Blizz truly learned from their mistake is what they do next. Now that Celestalon is gone, there is hope, but until I actually start seeing the depth being brought back I'm not going to assume they've learned anything just yet. Tho this is clearly the first step towards progress.</div></div><hr />

Yes, these games are made by large teams, but its not a democracy, there are leads who are in charge of the overall direction.<br />

Change leaders, change direction.<br />
