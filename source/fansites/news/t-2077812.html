Changes quest icons to the reward icon on individual zones.<br />
Shows world quests on the flight path map, allowing you to show them all or just tracked quests.<br />

Patch 7.1 - Trial of Valor: Guarm<br />
Guarm is the second boss in the Trial of Valor raid. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3NHWg4HVnzA&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Helya's vicious three-headed hound stands guard at the gates of Helheim. Bred to require neither comfort nor sleep, Guarm remains ever-watchful for any invaders who come to challenge the reign of his cruel mistress.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview - Guarm's Guardian's Breath (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227573-guardians-breath) unleashes three elements: Fire, Nature and Shadow. Guarm gains a stack of Frothing Rage (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/228174-frothing-rage) for every player not hit by one of his breath attacks.<br />
<br />
Taking damage from Guardian's Breath (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227573-guardians-breath) will result in a debuff: Fiery Phlegm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227539-fiery-phlegm), Salty Spittle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227566-salty-spittle) or Dark Discharge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227570-dark-discharge). Gaining any two of these is deadly.<br />
<br />
Periodically Guarm will become more mobile and aggressive, casting Roaring Leap (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227883-roaring-leap) andHeadlong Charge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227816-headlong-charge).<br />

When Guarm casts Guardian's Breath (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227573-guardians-breath), stand grouped with allies within either Fiery Phlegm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227539-fiery-phlegm), Salty Spittle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227566-salty-spittle) or Dark Discharge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227570-dark-discharge). Don't mix the elements!<br />
Move out of Guarm's way when he performs a Headlong Charge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227816-headlong-charge).<br />

Don't mix the elements!<br />
Move out of Guarm's way when he performs a Headlong Charge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227816-headlong-charge).<br />

Face Guarm away from your allies to avoid hitting them with Flashing Fangs (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/227514-flashing-fangs).<br />

World Quests<br />
World quests in dungeons. Yay: a different dung this wk, they drop loot even if you are not on WQ. Having trouble getting people to do them? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/777695719847137280))<br />
Asking because we have had problems in the past with incentivizing side bosses and quests. If not enough incentive, what needs to be added? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/777696076983709700))<br />
usually if you have higher Ilvl tank/healer in the group I've found it hard &quot;don't need it so not doing it want speed&quot;<br />
what do you think would incentivize that player? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/777697631556374529))<br />
<br />
I'm down to do these but cmon don't have them come out in the middle of the week when we've done them. Tuesdays only please?<br />
I think a better fix is to make it less painful to do the dungeon again, e.g. more rewarding. Dungeons are fun! IMO. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/777697241628745728))<br />
<br />
Did you do the weekly raid quest in WOTLK? E.G. Kill the extra giant before the gunship in ICC. How would you improve on this concept? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/777698808708739072))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Is there a way to find out exactly how gear works now in PvP? I'd really appreciate it good sir!<br />
Sure! In battlegrounds, arenas and Ashran, we set everyone's stats like they are wearing 850 gear. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/777028445918208002))<br />
We look at your average item level and for everyone 1 point above 800, we increase your stats by 0.1%. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/777028693461839872))<br />
<br />
is Mercenary Mode meant to not be up all the time for Horde? I got it once, queued 2 BGs then the vendor disappeared<br />
If queue times get low enough it goes away. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/777368467779354624))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
We resisted adding herd animals for hunters for a long time because there was no &quot;grass&quot; food. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/771084185821782017))<br />
We considered just letting them &quot;graze&quot; wherever without you having to feed them. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/771084271171743744))<br />
<br />
Do you think Legion or the intended purpose of Legion can fix the problems that Blizzard had in WoD like content drought<br />
I have no insider knowledge or anything. I think the biggest difference is they are saying they are no longer trying to do the expansion a year thing, so hopefully they can put all of their effort into making sure players never go too long without something new.<br />
<br />
Even back when I was there, we tried to ship expansions faster, which sometimes meant focusing less on the current expansion in order to shift all resources to the newer one. But then when we missed our dates, it just meant players had those long droughts. I think it's great that rather than being stubborn, the team is trying a different, and very player-focused strategy. I hope it works for them. (Source (http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler/answers/140565273739))<br />

Of course they are. They're just trying to shut up the QQers by giving them hope that their FOTM will stay OP.<br />

I wrote out a long post on incentivizing dungeon world quests, and, after a treatise on gating and rewards, just decided that giving players a choice between a piece of gear or another reward like AP or resources would probably solve a lot of the problem. When I don't do the dungeon quests, it's because I don't want the gear because I have a better item or better stats. If there were something useful to me there, I'd be more interested in doing it. <br />
<br />
As far as people who've already done the weekly not wanting to clear it for others, that's called selfishness. It's been present in WoW for many years, and there is no possible way to incentivize it out.</div></div><hr />

Really though, who cares of DH are good at AOE? They are not the best ST dps class so people need to calm down.<br />

Because AoE matters too? Especially in 5 mans. Their damage is incredibly high whether it's AoE or ST. There aren't many ST boss fights in raids either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There aren't many ST boss fights? Nythendra, Ursoc, Dragons of Nightmare, are for the most part ST. And like I said, so what if DH are good at AOE, I don't see a single complaint about Monks insane AOE damage or rogues crazy damage or their ability to gain 865 loot by pick pocketing etc etc. The fact is people like to hate the 'new guy'... Mages have always been really good dps, dont hear people crying about that?<br />
<br />
The most important fact about DH is that they have 2 specs and just 1 dps spec, so they have to be somewhat decent at something to make someone play something that has less to play around with. Anyway, salty people are always gona be salty...</div></div><hr />

Demon hunters are massivley OP, particularly their burst AOE<br />
<br />
Ans SPriests were incredibly strong, particularly in multidot, they are everything an afflock should be but isn't, because a hybrid class outshines them completely<br />
<br />
You're kidding right? Spriests are good on only two fights right now and after that they are moderately good. On something like Ursoc they'll be anywhere between 5th and 10th while Fire Mages are strong everywhere. The only reason Spreists are strong on Xavius is they can use a 10 minute cooldown twice, because of how the fight works, if that didn't work we would be slightly higher than middle of the pack.</div></div><hr />

It's a buff nonetheless... wait out for how it turns out compared to others before you bite the hand that feeds.<br />

Also: as far the class forums on MMO-champion go, the general consensus seems to be &quot;our class-dps sucks big-time&quot;, no matter into which subforum you go. And the warrior one is no exception to that rule, with the occasional &quot;our class fantasy sucks&quot;-thread.</div></div><hr />

what do you think would incentivize that player? (Muffinus)<br />
<br />
I'm down to do these but cmon don't have them come out in the middle of the week when we've done them. Tuesdays only please?<br />
I think a better fix is to make it less painful to do the dungeon again, e.g. more rewarding. Dungeons are fun! IMO. (Muffinus)<br />
<br />
Did you do the weekly raid quest in WOTLK? E.G. Kill the extra giant before the gunship in ICC. How would you improve on this concept? (Muffinus)<br />
<br />
Not playing with random people from 5 different realms who you will never see again would incentivize players. You can't expect people you don't know and who you will never see again to always help you out. It just doesn't work that way. People are more likely to help someone when they can see them progress and see their enjoyment and they can bond and play together more often.</div></div><hr />

thats because they play shitty dungeons with shitty players - if they've done high mythic + with good dks/shamies/monks they wouldnt spew nonsense about DH being OP - DH are op only in shit content where trash dies in 5 globals making their numbers artificially higher then they realy are - when trahs lives more then 10-15 globals DH aoe plumets from crazy numbers to tiny above others</div></div><hr />

It's fair to say the burst of DH is overpowered. Sustained is just fine and fair. But this kind of thing isn't new -- Bladestorm, for instance, was known to be ridiculously high and never really saw the nerf bat.<br />
<br />
Logs are showing Havoc as very strong. Not ridiculously strong -- but strong. They are still number 1 but not so high as to be &quot;ridiculous&quot;. They are in the same relation to all #1 specs have.<br />
<br />
If they nerf DH's -- then, wait for it, someone else will be #1.. nerf that too? Ok.. so someone else is #1.</div></div><hr />

You don't see people complaining about monk aoe because they were already complained about and were already nerfed. That means you guys are now the top so now it's your turn to be brought down. Ffs you're top aoe damage and you're whining about second and third, saying they should be nerfed instead. It's ridiculous. <br />
<br />
And there is no point complaining about mages since the devs play them they'll never be nerfed. If you want your class to be OP apply for a job at blizzard.<br />

Yes, that's called balancing. Eventually you'll get to a point from doing that where all the classes end up being within 10k of each other. Right now there is a 100k difference between top dps and bottom, that needs to be fixed it's pathetic.</div></div><hr />

No, he's right. The buff makes no sense. Fury AoE is fine, yet those are the abilities they buffed the most. Meanwhile Fury ST is bottom of the pack, and it's also the only class that takes increased damage (30%!) for just following their class mechanic. The &quot;buffs&quot; don't really address either of those. For ST they should've massively buffed RB and Execute, and the increased damage taken bullshit should be removed all together.</div></div><hr />

When in the history of the game have classes ever been within a few % of each other? This has never been the case.

What a joke.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's because DH playerbase are smarter and know what they do but people (even blizz it seems) don't know ? i.e: <br />
1) &quot;LEL you're too strong AOE nerf you&quot;<br />
2) A nerf inc. (diserved but not this way)<br />
3) People are happy without even knowing the class and even spitting on DHs<br />
=&gt; This is called blind sheep effect. It's like diving into theories of someone else without even knowing the underground. IF someone reacts like this in my team at work, I would punch him hard cause not a real scientific approach.<br />
<br />
We all (DH community) are agree with a nerf, but they nerf it the wrong way with a bad design talent from the start (we all knew it would come cause our main ST damage come from ... our cleave posssible spell, what a bad design). In fact, they need to fix our talents and spell, also mastery which we don't want at all more then gimping us in ST so that we don't have raid slot anymore.<br />
<br />
That's why DH are QQ, not by the &quot;nerf effect&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, there is lot of DH that doesn't know how to DPS to be top, I swear. Gap skill is huge and the gameplay is more risky than all other classes. The gap in the chart with recents sims is absurd. DH don't need such a nerf, they need a refactor of the design as well as other bottom classes in DPS charts.</div></div><hr />

World Quest List - dont know what it is with that one. Something about the list being out side the map window doesnt sit right with me ascetically. Maybe its what people dislike about WQ Tracker. To each their own though, wont call it trash.</div></div><hr />
