Winged Guardian Model Preview<br />
The final model of the Winged Guardian (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/69846/winged-guardian/) has been added to the PTR files and we now have a better idea of how it looks. The official preview gave you a good idea of the light effect on the wings, I'll try to make a video available very shortly. <br />

... You know if it wasn't for your A and B comments I would say you entire post was pathetic. The Value of a mount does not come from how rare it is but the ENJOYMENT you get from HAVING the mount. If your only joy comes from being special then the mount was devalued from the start since they are for using to get from point A to B, not to sit around on and pretend you are in a brand new Mercedes Benz SLR McLaren Roadster. :/<br />

This is b*llshit. I love this mount, but I'm not buying it, and I'll /spit on every single player I see on this (unless 100% of the money goes to something else than this shitty company)<br />

Someone's enjoying a nice tall glass of Haterade. If you don't have 25$ to spend on a game perk then don't buy it. Not like the mount will give anyone an unfair advantage in anything.<br />
<br />
Spitting on people who will own one will only show them how hateful and jealous you are of them. I won't buy this mount (unless at least half of the money goes to charity), but I won't hate on anyone who does.</div></div><hr />

In that regard, I think I'm allowed to be somewhat negative about a mount added in this way, especially if it's a mount that has a lot more effort put into it than the mounts you can actually earn through in-game activities.

Would you rather they increase the cost of the monthly subscriptions? If you don't want the mount then don't buy it. No one is making you purchase the damn thing. People are still going to play the game and try to obtain other mounts whether or not this mount is available, so I don't really see your point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see a reason why they should, the price of the expansions is high enough to cover the costs of producing it, and the monthly subscriptions are enough to cover the patches, maintance and server costs while also giving a nice profit. If they want more profit, they could improve the game to get more subscribers. Or they could do this, greatly increasing short term profits but possibly hurting the long time ones.<br />
And I'm not so sure about the last point of yours. Some people will still collect of course. But I think a significant amount of people would no longer care about several mounts obtainable after buying this one. Not caring about mounts is no time spend obtaining them, which means more time spend in other areas of the game, more time spend in other areas of the game leads to boredom in those aspects and less overall satisfaction, boredom and less overall satisfaction could lead to a loss of a player, and a loss of a player can be deadly in a community orientated game. You and I could not be influenced directly in that way, but that doesn't mean no one is. Even if you think the effects are minimal, they will still be largely negative, unlike a mount added through content would have.<br />
<br />
And as to me buying it, or not buying it, it is irrelevant for the purposes of this discussion, and I never even said if I would or wouldn't.</div></div><hr />

Because it indirectly affects them. Many are worried that Blizzard is going to go too far and turn this game into an item mall/subscription based game.<br />
<br />
Many will argue it already is an item mall game. But how long until you are required to buy from the Blizzard Store to enjoy the game. Some already say they are doing that already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some Forum types:<br />
<br />
First, there are those who hate it cause it looks good but making a statement not to buy it due to it being everywhere. I understand this<br />
cause it has no affection value if most people are having the item, cause be honest you wont buy the same car as everyone else, <br />
then it has no &quot;new&quot; feeling to it.<br />
however I do reason, that I atleast would not enjoy it if im not being able to obtain it in a game, I dont play this game to buy stuff out of it .<br />
(could buy more useful things irl wich gives ME more). Ps: I dont agree with the true haters wich does it cause of jealosy, it's the worst thing about<br />
human social nature.<br />
<br />
Second, there are those that say they dont care about what other people think, yet pointing out what others think is wrong ergo DO CARE ;)<br />
else they would not defend it so bad ;) (a person who dont care, dont respond to irrational statements, there for not care, do not bother)<br />
ps: and please just dont respond to this: cause this is a stupid behaviour and needs to be adressed, if you do that the trolls feeds on you sorry to say, it's also human nature to take pleasure in other peoples missfortune.<br />
<br />
Third,(here is the reasoning I dont understand) there are those that say they will purchase it cause of enjoyment, what are the enjoyment tell me? example; your flying and mining / herbing you land, and hardly take a look what you are riding on, or do you stare at it for hours and then what? tell me what is the enjoyment of the mount are, if it's not specially obtainable in game from achieving something wich you can take pride in (for whatever personal reason)?<br />
<br />
Fourth; there are those that Collect mounts, the collectors that need to have it all, cause it fills some empty spot in their mind, maybe lack of affection, lack of love or honestly being bored with the game, but got no alternative but to try make it more meaningful by achive things ingame for the time being.<br />
<br />
It's human nature to wear/use things to raise their status among peers.<br />
<br />
So WHY do you want it? Then I guess I get response from most that will buy it, cause I can.<br />
<br />
I can agree on that, you can. But ask yourself, is it worth it? IF yes ; Your the type that needs approval in some sort, and an easy way to get it the better.<br />
IF no: I know that you are pretty satisfied with yourself and dont need approval or also good with money not to spend it on air. ;)<br />
<br />
If you want it you buy it, if not you dont buy it, very simple. <br />
<br />
There is no reason to hate people cause they want things, Blizzard only tend to their needs ;) so stop the jealosy.<br />
<br />
(expecting alot of defense inc) ;)<br />
(sorry for my bad english, not my native language)<br />
<br />
And for the people who say they will purchase it IF there was any charity, please just no, there is no justification for you taking a selfish act, you<br />
mearly falling for a market scheme.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to participate in them, there is nothing on the store (thank you Blizz) that will make you a &quot;better&quot; player. They're all vanity/novel items that some players might enjoy and others won't. Your monthly subscription still gives you raids, pvp, trade chat (I know, I know).<br />
<br />
Similarly, I don't get the &quot;more people = less attractive&quot; argument. Does the number of pixels correlate to the amount of owners? If everyone buys it, does it suddenly become something from the NES days?<br />
<br />
I could perhaps understand it if Blizz were neglecting &quot;in game&quot;. But, with the Celestial Steed you also had the 2 meta achievement mounts and Invincible. Firelands, whenever that decides to show up, will likely have the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. For now. <br />
The hate in my opinion is generated by the fear of something worse happening if those attempts at micro transactions are too successfull. And they are. Imagine you're blizzard and you're able to make loads of extra cash with very little effort, wouldn't you be tempted to investigate a bit further that miraculous cash flow. I know If was them I wouldnt give a sh** about the game anymore i'd just try to find the best way milk out money while the game is still popular and there's millions of customer willing to pay for that kind of stuff.<br />
<br />
I even think at this point they don't even care about wow being a good game or not, because whether wow stays popular or dies, they win either way since they have another mmo in preparation.</div></div><hr />

but one of the reasons i started playing WoW is because it had a monthly subscription and i believed i wouldn't have to deal with that shit.<br />
<br />
Who made those rules? You? Who assumed those rules? You?<br />
<br />
The fact is there are other subscription games that actually sell gear, and useful items in their cashshops (not just cosmetic items). In fact, there are other games which allow you to buy items in cashshops and then allows you to sell those items in game for currency.. (ie.. effectively allowing you to buy gold ingame). This practice has gone all the way back to UO.. where you could but ingame items for cash and actually have a GM show up to give you the item.<br />
<br />
I am sorry you are disappointed because Blizzard didn´t follow rules that you created.</div></div><hr />

WoW is going free to play contrary to what everyone believes, its the only way they are going to continue to compete with the new mmo's coming out. WoW isn't doing anything new aside from gimmicky encounters. Once you see a major store content update with a bunch of in-game stuff, you will know they will be making the transition to free to play soon after. I actually see it happening relatively soon after Diablo III's release due to people leaving wow to play it. Making WoW free to play will keep people around after the exodus to Diablo III.</div></div><hr />

Not seeing it. Most of the MMO's that were monthly and then went free to play was because the numbers were so dismal or after the initial month included with the game, people saw how crappy the game was and didn't renew.<br />
<br />
WoW doesn't have that issue at all, even if magically 25% of the people world wide quit tomorrow, while they'd have to merge some servers maybe, they'd be fine still.<br />

Newer MMO's coming out as FTP style are doing it because they know they just can't make it against WoW in the traditional monthly billing way.<br />

EQ2 says hi. SoE even went so far as to charge an additional monthly fee to access special zones they created. Imagine if, say, Firelands came out but cost you an additional $1.50 per month to access. <br />
<br />
LotRO has a subscription program alongside it's F2P model, where you get an allotment of &quot;credits&quot; for their cash store every month, plus access to a few extra zones, if I remember correctly. <br />
<br />
That's just off the top of my head. I bet I could find more if I wanted to bother researching it.</div></div><hr />

Hmm okay, considered the choices Blizzard made since Cata, raising WoW montly fee could be another way to achieve their goal of losing players.<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems as if the piece on Rift in the MMO-Report seems to confirm this too. At least to it, they made it seem as if WoW is losing tons of players to Rift. <br />
<br />
However, I don't think they will lose players because of the mount, what I do think though, is if they made the mount attainable in game via a quest, they might keep more players, and as thus monthly subscriptions than the amount of mounts sold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously get over yourselves (half of this community). 25 bucks is like, what, 2 or 3 hours of work at minimum wage. Thats, like, 4 coffees at a Starbucks and it goes to a good cause (potentially). IF (as its unconfirmed but highly likely) a portion goes to Tsunami victims those that buy it get to show that they are charitable and support working towards lessening a tragedy. But to you, human life costs nothing, its not close to home, you haven't had to suffer. Get over yourselves and off your high horse, those whining the loudest likely don't even have a Phoenix, Mimiron mount or Invincible. So are you upset that one dude can't show off how special he is with this SPECIFIC mount? Dream on your glorious bastards.<br />
<br />
Did you really think that the Sparklepony was going to be the only mount available from the store, stop acting as if this is a great travesty that another has become available, the precident was already set. Not to mention that flying mounts don't even matter anymore, their just shiny decorations mechanically. In no way does this break the game that someone is shinier than your Bronze drake. You think its hard to get a flying mount, you think its somehow &quot;welfare&quot;, then its you really need to learn2play or get out of your mom's basement and get a job. Time is money, if you were paid minimum wage to raid for this mount and you really wanted it to drop, how much time would you invest, certainly not 25 dollars worth. Think of it as Blizzard SAVING you money. If your that concerned about your wallet stop paying for an MMO with a monthly fee, this game isn't for you.<br />
<br />
But doesn't that mean everyone will have it? I don't lose my shit any time I see someone driving the same car as me, it doesn't make me feel special. It's a car, its available to people to purchase, some do, some don't some people choose to drive other cars. Atleast I'm not paying a monthly insurance rate and for gas and maintenance of this mount.<br />
<br />
On the other side, corporations like to make money... shocking. Turns out most of you live in capitalist society's, this is your most desired trait. Blizzard isn't exploiting you HALF as hard as they should be by society's standards. Your bank likely takes a Blizzard mount out in fees every month just to hold onto your money, and it wont (likely) go to victims.<br />
<br />
And while I realize 90% of you are trolling as this community false outrage at EVERY update ever, you guys really need to start shutting the fuck up, the joke is over, its no longer funny acting like a tool on the net when so many other people do it.<br />
<br />
As for the people whining about the possible donation aspect of the mount. Seriously, go out, donate 12.50 to the Victims, you wont give that 12.50 to Blizzard you are griping about. HOWEVER, you likely WON'T do that, so, whats wrong with getting something AND them getting money, nothing. Your being charitable and doing a good thing for people in need that you wouldn't have otherwise done, and your getting a mount for doing so. So, if there is a donation aspect those in Japan get thousands of dollars that people wouldn't have donated otherwise. Blizzard has already stated that they are matching in office donations out of their own pockets already, so stop acting like they aren't doing anything on their own. These people need the money way more than the make a wish foundation. But all you do is fester hate on the internet, your not going to leave the house and go donate money.<br />
<br />
Not to mention how much Japan donated when Hurricane Katrina happened, get off your high horses and stop squandering your money like horrible little goblins. I'm not saying you have to donate, its your money, do what you want with it, go buy some McDonalds and keep living your sad life of entitlement.<br />
<br />
I'm sick of ignorant people dripping hate filled jibberish all over these forums. You are the reason Blizzard may never update the player models.

That is not the issue, many people who are veterans, even the ones who came in in BC are getting bored of the games general mechanics, nothing is really new aside from talent tweaks and UI additions, no new ability mechanics have been introduced really, damage is done the same as its been, healing is all the same, tanking is the same, masteries only altered niche ways to do things all they do is alter it. A a lot of people aren't seeing the worth in paying 15$ a month for a game they hardly play anymore. Blizzard will keep player base that want's to quit playing by going free micro transaction based and it will keep their active numbers up. They will still have all their payed services. You will still pay for expansions. If WoW went free to play tomorrow, by the end of the month there would be a million more players guaranteed.</div></div><hr />

i dont agree with the theory of them making you pay for drops but oh lord is it hilarious to think of.<br />
<br />
Nice pole arm or something you have wanted drops. you get like a 30 min preview/trial period with it and then a link pops up to purchase the full version and with purchase you are then able to socket/enchant/reforge. that would definately be a game killer.<br />

The Winged Guardian looks awesome!<br />
<br />
However it'll look terrible a week after it's released and you see a few dozen of them running around everywhere you go.<br />
<br />
just like every Frostbrood, Proto Drake, Netherdrake, Headless Horsemen, Raven Lords, Celestial Steeds, Northrend Drakes etc etc etc.<br />
<br />
my point is there are tons of ppl with all the same mounts, nothing is unique. just because someone has a mount i have, doesnt dicate how i perceive its attractiveness.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Buckwald</div><div class="date">2011-03-28, 07:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, here's a couple of questions. I have The Dark Pheonix. Is that not cool because &quot;even newbs can clear normals&quot;? I have the ICC 25 Man Drake. I got it when it was current content. Is that not cool because &quot;even scrubs can go do old content?&quot; I have both the Black Drake and Twilight Drake, I got them during ToC. Are those not cool &quot;because faceroll DKs can solo them&quot;?<br />
<br />
Everyone is calling the Winged Guardian a newb mount and how mounts need work to obtain them. Well, can some one please name some mounts that aren't &quot;easily&quot; farmable (other than Ashes and Invincible)? What makes a mount &quot;epic&quot;? You can farm Anzu every day. You can farm the White Hawkstrider every day. You can farm Deathcharger everyday. You can farm Fiery Horse every week. You can farm Ashes every week. All of them easily accessable by everyone. So, according to the majority of the Winged Lion haters, those are scrub mounts too, right?<br />
<br />
/sigh</div></div><hr />

I tend to assume if someone is paying for something, they're making an investment and don't just disappear because they get slightly bored.<br />
<br />
The thing is tho their numbers would go up, right now most raiders get bored after they complete a raid and farm it for a month or 2 then they stop playing until next major content patch. If they go free to play those players will likely continue to play even if they content is still the same. Plus if it goes free to play Blizzard could easily charge 10-20$ for a major content patch, which in the end is optional because everyone with the expansion still gets the class changes and all the expansion perks but would not be able to get the best gear. They can target certain aspects of the game and charge for them. This way they can guarantee the people who like to do certain things in game are going to be paying for it in some way.</div></div><hr />

I spent 25 bucks at the liquor store yesterday purchasing a bottle of wine and 2 beers, how dare they have donated a portion of my sale to the Japanese, I am outraged by this. They provided an entirely optional product and I purchased it, enjoyed it but doing so to help others disgusts me. I hate everything! /sarcasm<br />
<br />
Seriously get over yourselves (half of this community). 25 bucks is like, what, 2 or 3 hours of work at minimum wage. Thats, like, 4 coffees at a Starbucks and it goes to a good cause (potentially). IF (as its unconfirmed but highly likely) a portion goes to Tsunami victims those that buy it get to show that they are charitable and support working towards lessening a tragedy. But to you, human life costs nothing, its not close to home, you haven't had to suffer. Get over yourselves and off your high horse, those whining the loudest likely don't even have a Phoenix, Mimiron mount or Invincible. So are you upset that one dude can't show off how special he is with this SPECIFIC mount? Dream on your glorious bastards.<br />
<br />
Did you really think that the Sparklepony was going to be the only mount available from the store, stop acting as if this is a great travesty that another has become available, the precident was already set. Not to mention that flying mounts don't even matter anymore, their just shiny decorations mechanically. In no way does this break the game that someone is shinier than your Bronze drake. You think its hard to get a flying mount, you think its somehow &quot;welfare&quot;, then its you really need to learn2play or get out of your mom's basement and get a job. Time is money, if you were paid minimum wage to raid for this mount and you really wanted it to drop, how much time would you invest, certainly not 25 dollars worth. Think of it as Blizzard SAVING you money. If your that concerned about your wallet stop paying for an MMO with a monthly fee, this game isn't for you.<br />
<br />
But doesn't that mean everyone will have it? I don't lose my shit any time I see someone driving the same car as me, it doesn't make me feel special. It's a car, its available to people to purchase, some do, some don't some people choose to drive other cars. Atleast I'm not paying a monthly insurance rate and for gas and maintenance of this mount.<br />
<br />
On the other side, corporations like to make money... shocking. Turns out most of you live in capitalist society's, this is your most desired trait. Blizzard isn't exploiting you HALF as hard as they should be by society's standards. Your bank likely takes a Blizzard mount out in fees every month just to hold onto your money, and it wont (likely) go to victims.<br />
<br />
And while I realize 90% of you are trolling as this community false outrage at EVERY update ever, you guys really need to start shutting the fuck up, the joke is over, its no longer funny acting like a tool on the net when so many other people do it.<br />
<br />
As for the people whining about the possible donation aspect of the mount. Seriously, go out, donate 12.50 to the Victims, you wont give that 12.50 to Blizzard you are griping about. HOWEVER, you likely WON'T do that, so, whats wrong with getting something AND them getting money, nothing. Your being charitable and doing a good thing for people in need that you wouldn't have otherwise done, and your getting a mount for doing so. So, if there is a donation aspect those in Japan get thousands of dollars that people wouldn't have donated otherwise. Blizzard has already stated that they are matching in office donations out of their own pockets already, so stop acting like they aren't doing anything on their own. These people need the money way more than the make a wish foundation. But all you do is fester hate on the internet, your not going to leave the house and go donate money.<br />
<br />
Not to mention how much Japan donated when Hurricane Katrina happened, get off your high horses and stop squandering your money like horrible little goblins. I'm not saying you have to donate, its your money, do what you want with it, go buy some McDonalds and keep living your sad life of entitlement.<br />
<br />
I'm sick of ignorant people dripping hate filled jibberish all over these forums. You are the reason Blizzard may never update the player models. Your entitled to your opinion certainly, your more than welcome to dislike it, however saying you will spit on people, ignore them, grief them or /gkick them for buying something they like the look of or donate to a cause they feel is just is beyond idiotic.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty fine with them selling virtual items all they like, and I mostly agree with everything you wrote, however I would like to point out that the prices they are demanding for this mount and the previous one just don't seem reasonable to me personally. We live in the DLC age, granted and I'm perfectly fine with that, you decide to buy additional stuff or you don't it is up to you, no-one is forcing you.<br />
<br />
But to demand 20 to 25 EUR for one low-poly model is simply put - sad.<br />
<br />
You pay 10-15EUR for DLC content for other games, for example FPS games, where you get 3-5 new maps, 10 new weapons, new player models and and sometimes even some new single player content, here on the other hand you get one model. It just doesn't want to work in my head, how they can demand so much for so little. <br />
<br />
But as I said, it's the decision of the customer if he wants to give them money or not.<br />
<br />
I'm certainly not looking down on people who decide to buy the mount or anything from their store, it's their earned money and they have the right to spend it on whatever they want, in fact I sometimes envy them, but the price is just too much for me, it's not that I cannot afford it, I just can't justify spending so much for so little. That said I'm looking forward seeing some of those manticores soaring the skies.</div></div><hr />

OT: I actually want the mount now. o_O<br />
Both.<br />
<br />
Also I bet everyones going to buy it and then never ride it again once Cynical Brit posts a video called &quot;THAT RETARDED LION&quot;<br />
because hes jealous that he can't afford one due to never doing anything but playing video games and making youtube videos.<br />
<br />
So that's where &quot;That Retarded Horse&quot; came from. Cool, I was right about whoever came up with that phrase was a tool. I'll buy it, and ride it. Because I ride mounts I -like-, not because they're rare or hard to come by. I d ohope at least some of the profit goes to Japan, but I'll still buy it just because it looks great. However, I'll wait until the animations come in before I make my final decision.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter. Blizzard hit the sweet spot with the Celestial Steed at 25 dollars - and SHITLOADS of people bought one. It has nothing to do with &quot;fitting in&quot; with the DLC age - it's called business. If they can sell them for 25 dollars in MASSIVE amounts, then why not?</div></div><hr />

WoW isn't doing anything new aside from gimmicky encounters. Once you see a major store content update with a bunch of in-game stuff, you will know they will be making the transition to free to play soon after. I actually see it happening relatively soon after Diablo III's release due to people leaving wow to play it. Making WoW free to play will keep people around after the exodus to Diablo III.<br />

<br />
You obviously put a lot of work in this post, and I thought it was well written. I do not however agree with your overall sentiments. <br />
<br />
I think the main problem that people are having is that there's a company here, that is not here for us, but for their own profits. This may not be illegal or even completely immoral, but it's easy to see how this affects people playing this game negatively. And who likes to be affected negatively for some distant nameless investors profits? <br />
In essence, everyone hopes that other people are doing their jobs, not for their own gains, but to spread as much happiness as possible. Some people like myself are actually doing so, and you will find especially in the games industry a lot of people who spend their working years like that. Most of the developers are just there because they want to create a great game, and it's easy to find this admirable. In fact, it's so admirable, that it makes it even sourer that the profits being earned here are not going en masse to the developers, they are mostly going to people who have spend no time to make your life more enjoyable through this game. I would say that this profit-grabbing technique is a good reason for many people to feel somewhat sad and disappointed, or even angry in some cases.<br />
<br />
The reason for the outrage of some people about the donation to Japan (which I actually believe is just a rumor), follows directly from that. If Blizzard would really care about Japan, they would just donate some of their own money. To abuse a donation to get people to buy their goods and make more profit, is very immoral. Essentially they are saying: &quot;Hey, well we don't really want to give anything to Japan on our own, but well if you want to, feel free, you only have to give us some money as well. We might as well give you this mount for it, so you can show to all of your friends how much you care about other people!&quot;. But, it's probably a rumor anyway, so I really hope that Blizzard would just give some of their own money to some charity and not link a donation to this mount. I guess some money to Japan is better than none, but this is just such a low method of obtaining more profit, and they should be ashamed if it turns out to be something other than a rumor.<br />
I don't want the company that I support through various purchases and monthly payments to be immoral money-grabbers, can you really blame me for that? Surely they must have enough by now to give all their employees a nice living without having to resort to these tactics.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gredge</div><div class="date">2011-04-02, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">that mount should be Alliance only, horde has no right to own/buy a lion which is pretty much a symbol of Alliance.<br />
1. The mount's proceeds go to Japan. <br />
2. Horde have a mount that is more of a lion than any alliance mount. (see Wyvern)<br />
3. Why the hell would Blizzard make a mount that is bought from Blizz store for one faction only? Lost profit if you ask me.<br />
4. Who are you to say Horde have no right to have a lion mount..hell, alliance don't even have a lion mount. They have TIGERS<br />
5. Stop with the QQ. Buy it for Japan, shouldn't have a better reason than that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will buy one for my girlfriend and if I like it I may get one for me. so not everyone is an idiot for getting them. there are alot of players out there that are good people that just like to cave cool things (or what they perceive as cool) and that doesn't make them stupid.<br />
<br />
what you are saying makes no sense, you never know when the person you ignore might just be a really nice person a good player and someone that could have been a good friend.<br />
<br />
if you don't want to buy one don't but to blanket ignore everyone who does is just well stupid IMO.</div></div><hr />
