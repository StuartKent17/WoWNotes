They're not quite nerfs though, as they are reverting the mastery nerf and even giving it a boost if I understand it correctly. Plus the 4P also got a boost.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Toppy</div><div class="date">2015-06-03, 12:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel as though blizzard has become a self parody. Like, each new update on the ptr is just more stuff that no one wanted. Look at the mounts for example.<br />
<br />
In 6.2, the mounts that aren't either mythic difficulty, or store shop, are:<br />
Two boars<br />
The Fel Hawk<br />
And a new Gronn<br />
<br />
In other words, its two boars, the most unpopular WoD mounts by far due to their horrible animations. One of which is a complete recolor, the other is simply using a new felboar mesh, and this is the important part, they couldn't even be bothered to give it a saddle like every other mount beast mount ever. Could you imagine if the other WoD mounts didnt have saddles?<br />
<br />
The Fel Hawk is a recolor, but at least somewhat unique. BUT. You can only get it by grinding out the most unpopular currency the game has ever had.<br />
<br />
And the new Gronn, which is an ok addition. But, you can only get it via Garrison missions, which is a widely unpopular feature. <br />
<br />
WoW has become a self parody, and it'd be funny if it weren't so sad.</div></div><hr />

Why do they feel the need to reduce an already pretty crappy set bonus for shaman yet buff the set bonus for discipline an already over performing healing class? Shaman are at the bottom of the pile for healers already, did we really need a kick when we were down?</div></div><hr />

I know they don't really care about making ingame mounts look good now because of the store mounts (their words), but if they're going to keep sticking new colouring on the same Boar mount could they at least give it a damned running animation. <br />
<br />
I mean, it looks OBJECTIVELY awful when it runs. It has NO running animation, the sped up walk just looks really dumb. Its bad enough that they're so lazy that they didnt even test how it looks before WOD but now they keep throwing skins on it without even trying to improve it. <br />

The guy who originally ran the site may have had grander dreams in the early days, that's the only reason it's called 'mmo' champ. He made a post waaay back (maybe even before he sold the site to Curse) that he wasn't really interested in expanding coverage beyond WoW. <br />

Different people run the site now, but it's been WoW only for years so I guess they haven't felt the need to expand the audience.</div></div><hr />

It would of been better to shove a saddle on one of the updated raptors you see in Gorgrond and add some new armour to an upgraded elekk but I suppose that's asking to much, why do that when you can CTRL C and CTRL V.<br />

Stay classy Blizzard.<br />
