Legendary Questline Difficulty<br />
To be fair, we've heard complaints that this is too hard for X, where X = just about every class/spec. It's supposed to be extremely challenging, harkening back to the feel of the Molten Core item quests, which were also not easy. On the other hand, you have unlimited attempts and time to try to figure it out.<br />
<br />
Warlocks have a good dispel in Devour Magic (Felhunter), though it's understandable that sometimes more PvE-oriented locks don't have as much experience using their pet in this manner.<br />
<br />
It may be really hard, but the feedback we've heard from those who have completed it (including warlocks), is that it ultimately brings a major sense of accomplishment. If you want a legendary item, this questline isn't for the faint of heart. But we do wish you luck.

2011 Blizzard Global Writing Contest!<br />
Blizzard Entertainment is proud to present the 2011 Blizzard® Global Writing Contest!<br />
<br />
You sit at your typewriter, hands frozen in fear by the sound of crumpling paper from the darkness behind you. Shadows of broken quills encroach on your sight's periphery but slither out of view when you turn toward them. Summoning your courage, you lash out at the apparitions before they fade, only to awaken in a cold sweat with pencils and pens gripped tight in your clenched fists. You know what this dream foretells: the 2011 Global Writing Contest is upon us!<br />
<br />
The Prophecy of the Unblinking Eye portends of a time when writing contest judges, mad with ocular fortitude from judging the 2009 and 2010 Global Writing Contests, would brazenly unleash the powers of the Ocunomicon. Seeking rituals to infuse themselves with the twisted souls of fel ocularians, they look to wield powers not meant for this or any other contest. But the sacrifices of semicolon keys and left-handed quills have only just begun, their Inkwells of Despair not yet depleted—there is time yet to save this contest!<br />
<br />
Is your prose pulchritudinous enough to save this contest from eldritch powers that no eye should possess? If so, submit a 2,500- to 7,500-word short story written in English and set in the Warcraft®, StarCraft®, or Diablo® universe by September 28th, 2011, and earn your chance to visit the Blizzard headquarters and meet the writers and staff behind the lore of Blizzard's games and books. (And probably save the world, too!*)<br />
<br />
Grand Prize - The grand prize winner will receive a trip to Blizzard's headquarters in Southern California, where you'll meet and eat with the Blizzard writing staff. In addition, you'll receive a Doomhammer™ hammer by Epic Weapons and copies of the StarCraft Archive, the Diablo Archive, the Warcraft Archive, the Warcraft: War of the Ancients Archive, and World of Warcraft: Chronicles of War. All books will be signed by Chris Metzen, their respective cover artists, and the Creative Development Publishing team.<br />
<br />
Runners-up - Seven runners-up will each receive copies of the StarCraft Archive, the Diablo Archive, the Warcraft Archive, the Warcraft: War of the Ancients Archive, and World of Warcraft: Chronicles of War. All books will be signed by Chris Metzen, their respective cover artists, and the Creative Development Publishing team.

DotA 2 Trailer<br />
In unrelated news, a DotA 2 trailer for Gamescom was released (http://blog.dota2.com/2011/08/dota2-gamescom-trailer/) today. More information will likely be released later this week. For more discussion, see the topics in our Video Games forum (www.mmo-champion.com/forums/293-Video-Games).<br />
<br />
The game will be previewed through The International (http://www.dota2.com/), a tournament held during the Gamescom this week with a $1M Cash prize! Shortly after, League of Legends (http://leagueoflegends.com/) announced a $5M Prize Pool (http://euw.leagueoflegends.com/news/league-legends-season-two-feature-5-million-prize-pool) for the Season 2 of their championship. <br />

Also really glad the legendary quests are a bit more difficult, the guildie we have doing it (warlock) had a bit of difficulty with it, but felt real accomplishment when she finally got it. The Old Hunter staff/Priest staff quests were awesome, it would be nice to see some more quest lines that invlove bit more challenge all round.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2011-08-16, 09:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The point being that the legendary quest of Through a Glass, Darkly, which I assume is what the blue post is about as that's where all the complaints is about and where the Devour thing is relevant, is that completely trivial and very easy for mages, while every other class has severe difficulties pulling it off (funny enough, I just completed it half an hour ago on my warlock). <br />
<br />
It's definitely do-able on a lock, and no it's not easy, and yes you feel like you're playing the wrong class, but ultimately the sense of accomplishment is ruined by the knowledge, the overwhelming evidence that this entire instance was tailored specifically for 1 class, completely neglecting the others, where moonkins arguably have it hardest (how are you guys even doing the boss?) followed by warlocks. Thát is what the complaints are about, and not about the difficulty as such. It's a legendary quest, of course it's supposed to be hard, and stating that warlocks are not accustomed to using Devour, hinting this is why locks say it's 'too hard', is rubbish in itself: any lock at this level should be aware and less or more proficient with the usage of his pet's abilities, PvE OR PvP.<br />
<br />
The issues with the pets and devour on this encounter are related to the fact the dragon flies and the pet can't attack it, not that we don't know how to use Devour. And for that matter, how are owls supposed to do it? Similarly, I can imagine mages may feel frustrated that for them, compared to other classes, this specific part of the quest is a walk through the park. So the complaints, essentially, are about the imbalance of the quest, rather than the difficulty itself.<br />
<br />
Edit: of course I still had a lot of fun and it was a very amazing quest, and I loved the challenge. That's not the point of my post, though. :)</div></div><hr />

Most of the deaths were caused by felhunter getting stuck on the platform making me unable to interrupt and devour the boss. I found even ordering it to attack the adds very risky. In the end I just ignored pet control except for two hotkeys for interrupt and devour and relied on soul swap, fear and glyphed shadowflame kiting to take out the adds. I personally didn't enjoy this quest at all. It wasn't hard per se, just very bugged and class biased in desgin. Fix the damn platform Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Yeah they aren't really making it easy for new gamers. DotA (Defense of the Ancients) was mod for WarCraft 3. But DotA, LoL (League of Legends) and HoN (Heroes of Newerth) aren't RTS (Real Time Strategy) games. They are MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena) games.<br />

For Moonkins there is no healing buff because they have no counter for it, they should have done the same for Mages tbh.I believe warlocks to be the most rewarding class for this quest simply because you must utilize your character to the full, using abilities you wouldn't usually use. This isn't a normal boss fight, you are tanking a mob above your level that can easily kill you very quickly, it should be extremely challenging. In fact I'd go as far as to say that if you are feeling a huge sense of accomplishment after defeating this boss as any other class than a warlock (and to some extent Moonkins) you did something to make it harder than it should have been.</div></div><hr />

If you are referring to the heroes, then yes, they are very similar to those found on Warcraft series. The first Dota (custom map for Warcraft 3) used mainly Warcraft 3 models, so obviously they will be very similar to what you can find in, say, WoW :)</div></div><hr />

THAT'S the problem. Once you figure that one out, you just park your pet on passive and send it on adds and the boss is easy.</div></div><hr />

Thing is, since its bugged its kinda annoying. <br />
Cant dispel the heal since felhunter just stands there doing F' all so I have to resummon it with soulburn to devour dispel because casting 5 second summon isnt really working over there most of the time. Its annoying because of the bug and would be so easy without. Oh and the pet sometimes kills itself randomly. Nice.<br />
<br />
Blizzard saying &quot;hurr durr pve locks havent used dispel so we understand iz hard *trollface* L2P&quot; is kinda bad answer when pets are totally bugged in the quest.<br />
<br />
But hey at least certain classes can have offensive dispel that gives you the heal and possibly casting on the move, CCing the add and bloodlust :rolleyes:. Its not that &quot;hard&quot; on difficulty - its annoying and what makes it &quot;hard&quot; is cos of bugged pets for warlocks which I think was the point of frustration in the thread.</div></div><hr />

Before you go all out laughing your arse off. Stop and have a look around , Have you completed the quest? If not then try doing it, I have heard many accounts of it being buggy as hell, making it more difficult than it should, it is already quite a challenging quest line, add in bugs and it makes it very much banging head off of a wall scenario. <br />
<br />
People want a challenge, they don't want to spend hours trying to accomplish something that by all means is almost impossible due to a bug they have no control over.<br />

Then the issue is a bug, not the difficulty. Ofcourse, one leads to the other, but reducing the difficulty will not solve the problem of the bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
League of Legends is made by a lot of the same people who did the first dota. Thats why their first 10 champs all have something in common / look like ones from Dota<br />
imo you should be asking why a game that is being made by Valve is being called Dota 2?<br />
<br />
I know the people who did the first one didnt copy right any thing and thats why dota 2 has a lot of the same champs, but for the love of god come up with a better name. <br />
<br />
<br />
also to the person asking why someone is complaining about the staff quest, it is pretty hard. I dont know how locks do it but I did it on a boomkin and it took me four hours to finish, the last boss would destroy me if i didn't do everything 100% perfect, its worthy of a complaint but its also nice that blizzard did something hard again.</div></div><hr />

Blergh, this means nothing to me. I don't have a clue what DotA is or stands for, if anything, since the website doesn't even tell you, and the only way I even know that LoL exists is cause my boyfriend plays it and talks about it sometimes. They're both RTS games aren't they? If so, that'll be why I don't know about them. :p<br />
<br />
Nice.. my condolences.</div></div><hr />
