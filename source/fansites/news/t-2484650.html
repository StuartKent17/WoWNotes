Blizzard character artists on the WoW team are responsible for concepting, 3D modeling AND texturing weapons, characters, and armor sets. <br />

<br />
what? so a guy drawing some 2d art onto a 3d model is somehow more dedicated then blizzard creating tons of 3d armor sets?<br />
<br />
idk if you know, but making a 2d drawing of armor ontop of 1 2d model is NO WHERE NEAR the time needed to make a 3d set of armor that works on a good 40 models...<br />
<br />
yes its nice, and the armor looks cool ,its good CONCEPT art, but it is NOTHING close to ingame 3d modeled armor.<br />

Wow this guy has made concept arts for almost every race, just 5 more allied races. Still making unique set for each class for each race would take significant amount of time. Drawing them is one thing and making them in 3d is completely another.<br />
<br />
pretty much, the process of drawing 2d art ontop of a 2d model is while yes skill based, it is NOTHING to making a 3d armor set to go ontop of 40+ models.<br />

<br />
Yea but tier sets were a neutral class specific as in one class tier for all races, a heritage class set would be a different class set for every race. Meaning a druid heritage set will look different on every race rather than every druid race look the same. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes lets add 12 new sets that sou- oh wait... 12 is only one per class, now we need 1 version of each for each race... meaning 12x23 (as we know we have atleast 2 more allied races coming) to a total of 276 sets... more than we have had from every raid in the history of wow.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;hey lets just tell blizzard to make as more sets then every raid ever has made, but in one patch!&quot;<br />
for comparison we have had 22 raid teirs, each with 9-12 raid sets (9-12 because vanilla and tbc did not have dk, and so on with the other sets)<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Seriously Blizz, can we get those armors? Hell next expansion, they should give us class quests again. I miss class stuff.<br />
<br />
to make a unique armor set for every race, for every class would mean more sets then we have had ever given to us by raids COMBINED.<br />
12x23+races=275<br />
vanilla =45<br />
tbc=36<br />
wotlk=38<br />
cata=30<br />
mop=33<br />
wod=66<br />
Legion=100<br />
(not bounting BFA) 348, so actuallty less, but not by much.</div></div><hr />

Yes lets add 12 new sets that sou- oh wait... 12 is only one per class, now we need 1 version of each for each race... meaning 12x23 (as we know we have atleast 2 more allied races coming) to a total of 276 sets... more than we have had from every raid in the history of wow.<br />
<br />
&quot;hey lets just tell blizzard to make as more sets then every raid ever has made, but in one patch!&quot;<br />
for comparison we have had 22 raid teirs, each with 9-12 raid sets (9-12 because vanilla and tbc did not have dk, and so on with the other sets)<br />

Feel free to dream. But expecting them to put any effort into armor design now when the current ones have been very uninspired since they don't have to make as many unique models and just palette swap well....</div></div><hr />

Don't worry mate. A lot of people want that design philosophy back in WoW.<br />

Was fuelled by passion and the interest to make an amazing product.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i would love if it was that easy, when i was a kid my dream job was going to blizzard and giving them ideas for all the coolest armors.<br />
<br />
but the thing is making an idea, making some concept art for armor, that is the easy part, literally anyone can come up with a cool idea<br />
&quot;legion raid, for warrior they are an Infernal, warlocks are Inquisitor, Priest is the shivvarah, paladin is felguard, etc&quot;<br />
<br />
concept art is easier, each of those armors above is like 20$ and 45 minutes of work, that is the easy part.<br />
<br />
making it into the 3d model, and making sure it works right, adding the phsyics, and arranging it on all the models. that is the part that takes days.<br />
<br />
I love the art, well most of it, sometimes I feel like he goes too much into &quot;warlocks use shadow&quot; i mean yes... but we also have fire, and fel, and soul... you dont need ot make EVERYTHING purple for warlocks...<br />
but its no where near making a 3d model.<br />

<br />
they have always pallet swapped, and have you seen the pvp armor and how bloody fucking amazing it is? same with the BoD armor? that triceratops shoulderpiece is legendary. also since when is pallet swap a bad thing? i want like 10 colours of every single armor, i want MORE choices.<br />
&quot;Wtf blizzard ANOTHER infernal recolour!?&quot; <br />
YES PLEASE i want MORE infernal colours, green, red, and icey blue is not enough, i want purple, i want black, i want light, i want electric.<br />
<br />
&quot;wow red and purple demon bat dog? come on&quot;<br />
NO I WANT MORE WHERE IS MY FEL ONE!? IIIII WAAAANT FEEEEL ONEEEEE!!!!!!<br />

It IS the only druid non-boomkin form to be bipedal. It's obvious its dance would be different than all the quadrupedal ones.<br />

We had that.<br />
<br />
It was called Tier Sets. Which they scrapped for the garbage Azerite system and so they didn't have to put as much work into designing a set for each individual class.<br />
<br />
Yeah. I totally loved having the next tier's set pieces sitting in my bank unusued for months because the old tier set was so good the ilvl increase wasn't worth it until I got the entire 4pc. Is there anything you don't bitch about. Everything you do is garbage this and lazy that.</div></div><hr />

to make a unique armor set for every race, for every class would mean more sets then we have had ever given to us by raids COMBINED.<br />
12x23+races=275<br />
vanilla =45<br />
tbc=36<br />
wotlk=38<br />
cata=30<br />
mop=33<br />
wod=66<br />
Legion=100<br />
(not bounting BFA) 348, so actuallty less, but not by much.<br />
<br />
Your math is wrong. Not every race has every class, which is what your 23x12 figure comes from. Put a little more thought into your response.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. Should take a bigger look at fan stuff dude.<br />
<br />
There is loads of stuff that's done a lot better than Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Legion had some ok sets but final tier was all awful because they know they didn't really have to put much work into it with them going away for the palette swaps and less sets in BFA.</div></div><hr />

I see it happening. Especially if the game goes B2P/F2P.<br />
<br />
Definitely see them selling an Allied Race unlock in the future which if they do then I definitely won't be coming back.</div></div><hr />

Are any of them really &quot;I gave up 12 sets for 4&quot; cool? BoD comes closest to it. Uldir just feels generic and Eternal Palace is just an embarrassment, imo.<br />
<br />
3/4 Warfront armor &quot;tiers&quot; look pretty good, the Night Elf one feels unfinished and soulless, especially compared to Forsaken.<br />

Dwarf heritage armor looks great for the most part, Blood Elf has a good idea but feels severely underworked.</div></div><hr />

dont feed the troll, he come to any controversial discussion and attack blizzard. He &quot;doesnt&quot; play anymore but still join ever conversation about the game.<br />

Night Elf warfront set was kinda meh, though. It was Forsaken warfont gear, especially the mail set, that was great. Night Elf side of things felt very phoned in and unfinished.<br />
<br />
Blood Elf heritage armor is the same. It has a cool design concept, at least, but it just feels like it's half-finished.<br />

Forsaken Warfront mail is legitimately one of the best armor sets in the game in recent times, imo. Even if you don't like the aesthetic, just from a work standpoint.</div></div><hr />
