Remember just because the Bug mounts shows up, don't mean will get it anything soon.

That it's for patch 5.4.8 instead of 6.0 now, and that it only exists in one color, certainly makes it overly likely another store mount.<br />
<br />
That just saddens me. There's plenty of great mounts up there already, denied to people without money to throw around, unable to earn them in the game.<br />

The BoS change smells like a datamining error. If they reduced the run speed increase to something like +60% it would seem believable, but 1%? Nah.</div></div><hr />

No one will take the talent in that case. Maybe if it broke roots instead of just snares, but the datamined info still talks about &quot;movement slowing effects.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can tell you exactly why. Because if they didn't I would be hoarding those and on launch night buying every possible piece of level 100 gear I could..... going to assume they are thinking ahead and probably removing it come 6.0.... if they don't then it makes no difference because I will just hoard the coins then grab all the valor at once and buy everything..... all at once.<br />
<br />
If you want a frame of reference..... I hoarded fuck loads of honor with the 5.1 badges before the change, after the change its much more difficult to do. I also have over 8k Justice Points saved up in those scenario crates, it was hard work, but its worth the effort.</div></div><hr />

Uhh, I don't know where you've heard that but that's far from true. Beetles aren't expert fliers by any means, but they're not &quot;technically&quot; incapable of flight. You may be referring to bumblebees which were in early years an aerodynamic curiosity but are now understood.<br />

<br />
<br />
It's a completely new model, completely new textures. And also, many of the animations are modified, so the skeleton isn't at all just taken from the Ahn'Qiraj Battle Tanks/Silithids. Among the completely new and unique flight animations, its attack animation and a few other animations are new, and the majority of other animations are modified to look smoother, more up to date.<br />
<br />
<br />
Example: silithid running looked more like sliding. While the cycle is very similar, this creature looks like it is actually making steps instead of gliding across the ground. That didn't just happen magically.</div></div><hr />

they're just the way SOO is being nerfed once it's past its relevant time period. By letting us boost our gear that is.<br />

*****************************<br />
<br />
Also concerning the Reaver Model's skeleton, Yarathir posted the following topic with gif images comparing the silithid and reaver mounts.<br />
<br />
http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1518342-Grinning-Reaver-(Ravager-mount)-gifs-and-some-explanations?p=27075291#post27075291<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Conclusion:<br />
<br />
Claims of &quot;lazy&quot; are completely unfounded and unfair. This new ravager mount is not a literal skeletal copy-paste with a new model. Even if it was, that would have been a big job. But it is the second largest and second most intensive/extensive task for 3D artists that was involved here. No, they didn't grab a new skeleton because they knew it had to behave roughly like an already existing creature does (the silithid), but they also certainly didn't just stuff a silithid skeleton on to the model and call it a day. Like the Pterodactyl mount that they created using the Proto-drake mount skeleton as base, they modified existing animations to be less choppy, more lively and well-animated, and added new animations altogether in many cases. Of course that is obvious for the flying, but there are also other new animations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Case in point: the running is similar, but there is no way it wasn't modified. The silithid's animation isn't particularly great compared to the ravager's. You can see the ravager actually set the steps, while the silithid glides across the ground. Not that I'm trying to bash the animators of that time because WoW was different then, and the models were of lesser quality for good reasons, not because the animators and modelers were bad.<br />
<br />
Thus as said in response to my post above. At this point it's not so much a &quot;Re&quot; anything, so much as it IS its own new model.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We haven't had this much content ever for the player base as a hole, maybe the first tier in WotLK comes close but still. Besides there has been content dry seasons in every single expansion, it's just different now since everyone can consume the current content at the same rate that only HC raiders did back in previous expansions, due to raid instances being locked behind single or a few difficulty choices, which forced the more casual players to either not consume content at all or complete the content when it's no longer relevant. <br />
<br />
Only time period when they have had a &quot;steady&quot; cycle time in content was classic, but this was mostly due to blizzard announcing the launch day of TBC before even actually hitting the beta, which caused a ridiculously short beta for TBC at the time. To demonstrate: MC ---&gt; BWL = 9 months, BT --&gt; SWP = 10 months, ICC --&gt; Cataclysm = 12 months etc, so no these long dry seasons are in no way uncommon.</div></div><hr />

Mark my words: they will release a new RAF mount within the next three months. They have to do something to dampen the sub loss.</div></div><hr />

Why not add some cool mounts to the game for anyone to get? Seems like lately the only way to get a awesome mount is be a heroic raider, or open your wallet. Why not another awesome archaeology mount? A reward for an epic quest? Anything is better than just having to pay more with a subscription we already pay.</div></div><hr />

No, I don't get sick of it as I actually have enough brains to know what a fucking reskin is, and realise that these are not reskins. They are remodels. <br />

Very different thing.<br />

The large part of its wings is actually normally hidden behind the shell like it is for a beetle. The wings are actually pretty large.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is an example of it during flight:<br />

<br />
We are repeatedly told that adding more people to a team will actually hurt development time rather than expedite it.<br />
<br />
We are repeatedly told, yet people repeatedly do not listen.<br />
<br />
as someone with over 15 years of experience in the software development field (programmer, designer, architect, team leader and project leader) i can tell you it's total bullc**p. you can most definitely shift resources from all teams of the same area (programmers can and often can do work in other people's code, graphic designers/artists most definitely complete each other's work (especially when given a common theme to work on) and animators use the same programs to do everything).<br />
<br />
the answer you paraphrased above simply say &quot;we will not invest in additional qualified manpower&quot; (read: people with experience and references) and the only people we're allowed/willing to hire are fresh out of collage without any prior experience (in which case it takes anywhere between 2 weeks and 6 months for the new member to provide output greater then the amount of time/resources of established team members you need to invest in him)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Here is an example of it during flight: Yes, I saw them quite well in the model viewer and I realize you're jumping eagerly to defend this mount's honor because you're in love with it. The wings still quite tiny compared to the size of the body, placed in a weird position (buttwings) and as such it's unlikely such a beast could achieve lift off unburdened, let alone with a rider. <br />
<br />
But like I said- it's not like improbable fliers are unknown in WoW. We have gem cats that run in the sky and bats with their wing membranes cut in such a way that they'd never be able to take off.</div></div><hr />

Just a big middle finger to the player base, although fanboys seem to enjoy those big, fat middles. <br />
<br />
When they continue to sell flying mounts, or provide them as RaF rewards, knowing full well they won't be flying come WoD... Well, like I said, I find it hilarious. That with the weak assed sales pitch for WoD was enough for me to unsub. <br />

people who make accounts just to bitch here dont get any respect.<br />
<br />
1. Flying mounts can be used for the majority of leveling content, RAF is sorta based on leveling with your friends, flying will come to WoD after the 1st patch, these mounts here are as fine as ground mounths as they are flying mounts.<br />
<br />
The models aren't &quot;doctored up&quot;, its just you phrasing it as negatively as you can to spread your poison. Even with armor ontop, they're improved fluid animations can be noticed. Animations make up the vast majority of what we &quot;see&quot; on our characters.<br />
<br />
More poisonous phrasing. We're getting an entire fort which will function as it is meant to in WoD. <br />
<br />
&quot;grind daily quests&quot; displays a level of ignorance that just makes me give up on responding to you anymore.</div></div><hr />

Basic respect lies in how we deal with each other here to properly discuss things. It is a vital part of any social interaction, even on the net. Without it being given, it is not received.

If you don't like something in the blizz store don't buy it. I didn't like the enchanted fey dragon so I didnt buy it, but i sure as hell bought the armored bloodwing and iron skyreaver because they look badass. I bought the crown of endless winter awhile back because it looks cool. The other 2 I didn't because they just meh. Lol @ people who want to quit the game because of blizz store mounts/cosmetics and no flying in first patch of WoD. Even though most these people would buy stat gear if it was up on blizz store, but I wouldn't that is when it would go too far. But shit TAKE A CHILL PILL PPL! lol<br />

<br />
I find respect on an anonymous internet forum about as useful as tits on a turtle, but I find cliches to be very useful when they fit. Based on your responses about flying they certainly fit. Unless there is a substantial loss of subs that they can link to flying being removed they won't put it back because they can develop content faster. They've skillfully guided the player base, especially the turd eaters, with an old promise of 6.1. What this does is allows them to sell a normal amount of expansions to the uninformed masses that haven't picked up on all the little hints that they'd prefer no flying at all. I'll be really surprised if, even after beta concludes, they come out with a solid answer on the flight thing. <br />
<br />
The models have been &quot;doctored up&quot; and it's easy to see if you side by side them. None of the changes, other than animations as you mentioned, are even visible in armor with helm on. For many that's not even a WoD selling point, just another pointless feature they spent man hours on.<br />
<br />
Given their intent to keep people on the ground and force interaction, how do you think they will get people out into the world at max level when they can't fly? They will tie dailies (and avoid the daily title by having them randomized or varied) to some must have rep or gear reward. Otherwise people will hit 100 and continue to sit in queue town, wishing they could fly. <br />
