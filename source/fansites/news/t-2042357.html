<br />
seeing how they did FFXIV, and TESO also on consoles and those games are really picking up too, with strong followings, guess where a good chunk of their playber base is on? Yep !! Consoles, not PCs<br />
<br />
If WoW went to PC&lt; it would probably treble in revenue, ofc they'd have to update the world a 2nd time, can't have some of those trees in places like Moonglade/Ferelas/Mulgore/Un'goro make it to console like that, you'd need next gen graphs but it could be done.<br />

There's only one piece of the puzzle for 2017 that's missing - what big releases are slated? Legion launches 2016. Overwatch probably won't get DLC like updates, for money anyway. Hearthstone sells new cards and &quot;adventures&quot;, Starcraft is dead in the water, and we know something new in the Diablo world is coming...<br />

So what box will be for sale next year? Very interesting to contemplate...maybe they have something up their sleeves for Blizzcon...</div></div><hr />

Starcraft and Diablo would be absolute garbage as MMO's.<br />
<br />
The gaming segment, first point, is stable to dying. MMO's aren't as prevalent a gaming destination as when they were fresh and new. People don't spend the majority of their time PC gaming and if you can't tell established raid times/days have been dying on WoW for years now. There was one guild left on my server doing traditional raid times/days two expansions running.<br />
<br />
You aren't going to pull people off phones, tablets, consoles and DVR's to create a viable MMO from even a hot IP. The way people keep themselves entertained now are on technologies and devices that didn't even exist 11 years ago when WoW launched. Oh and the most profitable gaming business model for sure didn't exist when WoW launched.<br />
<br />
Diablo and SC don't have deep enough lore to create worlds around. Both are pick up and play 15 minute at a time games. One match, one rift/greater rift, one bounty run. Diablo is nothing more than a glorified version of Gauntlet. You completely destroy SC, IMHO, if gear becomes an issue.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, I beg to differ. All my friends and associates, except for one brother-in-law who can't afford a decent PC, are full-time PC gamers. Cell phones are used in desperate times, such as in line at the grocery store. Once kiddos reach the age of self-reliance, and can buy all their own stuff, actual gamers (not people who only play Candy Crush) will check-out what's up on PC.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathranis</div><div class="date">2016-08-05, 01:51 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why do you think they pruned abilities?<br />
To make the game easier to pick up for returning players and players who are using level 100 boosts. It really is that simple.<br />
<br />
There are a lot of minor new features that were ultimately designed to help out returning / boosting players. There's now a tutorial sequence that teaches you your rotation when you boost, for example. The bag sorting and transmogrification changes allow you to clean up your inventory easily. The Adventure Guide tells you what content you should be focusing on as soon as you login.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Puddlejumper</div><div class="date">2016-08-05, 04:10 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really enjoyed the story. The villain winning the day through personal character growth is not a very common trope and I was pretty satisfied how it happened. Kinda sad that the lesson the Legion tried to teach Gul'dan is exactly the lesson they'll never learn and will be exactly why they fall to pieces so easily in the actual game. We will never see the day where a mob, named or not, goes looking for help when aggroed instead of standing and fighting.<br />
<br />
I know it would be a very different kind of game, and I'm not saying it would be more fun on a person to person basis, but just speculate with me: what would it be like if the Legion took the Broken Isles and proceeded to fortify them completely, and forced the collective players of each server to figure out a way to breach, against intelligent defense? It would certainly be much more memorable than this launch is slated to be, considering I fully expect for the game to release and for me to be afking safely in the middle of the Legion's holdings within the hour. Kinda breaks my fantasy.</div></div><hr />

You see it as a part of an Illidan related questline in Legion, and in the &quot;Tides of War&quot; book, Malkorok and a bunch of his orc spies are attacked by Alliance soldiers, who are clearly player characters.<br />

HoTS is in the third picture. Oh and does it make your life feel any better to post shit like this?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean that prune that barely removed anything when you consider they added new talents, abilities and artefact traits.</div></div><hr />

Guess what China ? Your not important, because your not real subs....anyone else seeing a pattern here ?</div></div><hr />

Nothing new from Blizzard, also the wording on how WoW is doing isn't great at all. If it was going good or better than WoD numbers they would use the word &quot;strong&quot; etc etc<br />
<br />
I guess Blizzard burned too many people with WoD, also someone should tell the shareholders to look at the WoW forums to really gauge how WoW is doing.</div></div><hr />

What the...? What do SJWs have to do with Legion? I've heard absolutely nothing relating to that kind of feedback for this expansion. You're a special kind of negative...</div></div><hr />

409 million MAU not dollars. MAU is Monthly active users. The amount of money is going to be higher than that.</div></div><hr />

Everyone who disagrees with Orkwuzhere's opinion and those like him are labeled a SJW or a cuck. Apparently.</div></div><hr />

No it downloads the whole script, starting at part 1 and ending through part 4.<br />

dude, stop even considering WoW on consoles. it's never going to happen.<br />
<br />
Part of me thinks the reason they cut so many abilities is to at least test it out. I can't say I wouldn't give it a try but I wouldn't have high hopes for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Didn't blizzard attempt it a while ago but put it on hold or somethin?<br />
<br />
No, they never even thought about it. And they never should. WoW wouldn't and couldn't work on consoles.</div></div><hr />

All my friends and associates, except for one brother-in-law who can't afford a decent PC, are full-time PC gamers. Cell phones are used in desperate times, such as in line at the grocery store. Once kiddos reach the age of self-reliance, and can buy all their own stuff, actual gamers (not people who only play Candy Crush) will check-out what's up on PC.<br />
<br />
Go outside anywhere and see some of the 7.5 million people playing Pokemon Go.<br />
<br />
Now, which PC game has sold 7.5 million copies its first month on the market in the past 5 years in its total lifetime?<br />
<br />
Your statement &quot;friends and associates&quot; is not the entirety of the gaming market.<br />
<br />
The gaming market now is split into two camps. The $100 million budget game that developers know will be a bona fide blockbuster beating any movie the month it's released and the &gt;million dollar game that becomes the next Angry Birds, Minecraft, Pokemon Go.<br />
<br />
The casual gaming market is the growth gaming market. The PC gaming market is slipping.</div></div><hr />

The casual gaming market is the growth gaming market. The PC gaming market is slipping.<br />
<br />
The PC gaming market is not slipping.<br />
<br />
The market reached a record high of $30 billion in 2015 (up 11% over 2014), and is predicted to climb to $42 billion by 2020.<br />
<br />
Definitely not slipping.<br />

<br />
Morrowind isn't a series, Morrowind is Elder Scrolls 3 in the series of the same name. Incidentally the first console ES game WAS Morrowind, not Skyrim.</div></div><hr />
