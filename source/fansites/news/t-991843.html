With the 4.3 patch we'll be introducing some changes to the way Valor Points (VP) are obtained, as well as the items that they can purchase.<br />
<br />
Changes coming in 4.3:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Looking for Dungeon — 150 VP per run, with a cap of seven runs per week. All Cataclysm heroic dungeons introduced in 4.0, 4.1, and 4.3, will provide 150 Valor per run.<br />
Looking for Raid — 250 VP per run, with a cap of 500 per week. The 4.3 raid, Dragon Soul, will be split into two separate raids for the Raid Finder. While individual bosses do not drop Valor when using the Raid Finder, you will receive 250 Valor for completing each Dragon Soul raid. Each boss will only drop loot for you once per week, but you will continue to get the 250 Valor for completing each Raid Finder raid, up to the 500 cap.<br />
10 player raid boss — 115 VP. There are nine bosses per week, counting Baradin Hold.<br />
25 player raid boss — 135 VP. There are nine bosses per week, counting Baradin Hold.<br />
Valor Points cap at 1000 per week.<br />
<br />
<br />
As you acquire Valor you'll want to spend it, and vendors will be offering a wide range of items to equip you to take on the Dragon Soul raid encounters, including cloaks, rings, ranged weapons, necklaces, trinkets, chest pieces, helms, gloves, bracers, boots, and belts, all of which are ilvl 397.<br />
<br />
Our goal with these changes is to move Valor back to the original intent of currency rewards as a consolation prize, for two main reasons: to make it less frustrating when you keep having bad luck getting an item you want from a particular boss, and to help encourage you to keep fighting bosses (and helping out the rest of your group) even if that particular boss didn’t drop anything for your character in particular. Over time we have also offered Valor as a reward for doing other activities (such as participating in Heroic 5-player dungeons) to provide players something to do on an off night or when they couldn’t raid.<br />
<br />
In the past we have offered some tier pieces on the Valor vendor for players that just couldn’t justify the time or logistics necessary to participate in raids, but we’re hoping that the introduction of the Raid Finder tool helps remove that barrier. We think most players would agree that killing a giant monster and looting its corpse is more exciting than slowly farming a currency to purchase a reward. Currencies have their place, but we want them to be a secondary avenue of progression to boss killing.<br />
<br />
While the Raid Finder will provide a lower difficulty for the Dragon Soul raids, and thus a lower ilvl of gear, the normal 10 and 25 raids will drop ilvl 397, with the final Deathwing encounters dropping ilvl 403. For the Heroic version, 10 and 25 will drop ilvl 410, and the Heroic Deathwing encounters will drop ilvl 416 loot.<br />
<br />
As we near the release of 4.3 we’ll be posting everything you need to know about the Valor to Justice down-conversion process, so stay tuned.</div></div><hr />

The cap is to keep the game balance. If they removed the cap the no life players who are on 24/7 would eclipse everyone else in terms of gear. Day 2 of patch and you have ppl in full current lvl gear? That is the major flaw of having an easily obtainable currency in any game. Gold not really counting cause it doesn't directly translate into top lvl gear, some prof. pieces, but that is about it.</div></div><hr />

It makes content last longer though :(<br /> 
<br />
Nice changes. I think all heroics should have granted the same valor reward since they released the troll instances. So it will be nice to just run the LFR and a couple of random heroics to cap each week on my toons. The gear available from valor is nice as well. No more tier but everyone should be able to obtain some level of tier. The new gear options is also beneficial for the reasons that they stated. I won't be surprised if people complain about all the options but I like being able to obtain a near complete set without getting loot off of bosses.</div></div><hr />

According to the post, the raidfinder gear will be the same level as the LFD gear and Valor equipment... Not sure how happy I am about that, seeing as how you'll run out of options rather quickly, then LFR for valor doesn't even mean anything anymore.<br />
<br />
Basically, you get a full set of 397 gear and then, nothing... Unless you raid normal/heroic.</div></div><hr />

Why do you think its ok to endlessly farm currency, especially when we always have a current item that is BoE, not too mention, farming all that is needed in a week, and then completely deserting the content after that.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know they don't want content to go stale that fast, also imagine all the tanks farming all they need, and then, a week later, their aren't any tanks to run, putting a lock on the dungeon finder completely.<br />
<br />
<br />
You have to think about how this effects all situations not just the fact that &quot;you&quot; want it.<br />
<br />
Their are more factors, but I'll save them for a counter arguement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, the cap on stuff is just annoying. Or if they insist on a cap, raise it. It's incredibly easy to cap out on valor points per already and it will be even more so in 4.3.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xskarma</div><div class="date">2011-10-05, 01:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">According to the post, the raidfinder gear will be the same level as the LFD gear and Valor equipment...

That's not true, quote:<br />
<br />
While the Raid Finder will provide a lower difficulty for the Dragon Soul raids, and thus a lower ilvl of gear, the normal 10 and 25 raids will drop ilvl 397,<br />
<br />
So it's going to be below 397 at least, so you got the levels mixed up.<br />
<br />
Thing is though I can't imagine them putting a raid, even the LFR one, at the same ilevel as a dungeon, so my guess is above 378. That leaves 384 and 391 as the slots to fill.</div></div><hr />

Raise it up to 1500 and then you might give me a reason to bash my head against the wall with a bunch of bads a couple of times per week. Not worth it if you can't get a piece of gear every week, and waiting on dungeon queues is painful if your main spec is DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah kk my bad :) then yes 10 man will have to make up that 80 valor by running 1 dungeon. Though if you are able to clear Dragon Soul, my guess is that you won't need the valor anymore anyway, though you could possibly sell bracers again, I saw 397 level ones that were BoE in the files. :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
They alread posted the ilvl gear drop for the new 5mans. 378.<br />
<br />
And if they're releasing it as is in PTR... they're way easier than ZA/ZG... or even original heroics.<br />
<br />
The bad move in the new valor changes are pushing old, nerfed and overgeared content back to give top valor points. No reason for 4.0 and Zandalari to give 150 VP.<br />
<br />
Also the same mistake as before. Doing heroics or raids will give the same valor points in the end, except that now they think that removing the Tier pieces solves the problem. The way they're saying we have even more gear to buy with valor points. Wich goes against what they &quot;discovered&quot; about raids not offering enough unique gear over valor/heroic farm. If they're giving every single slot a valor option of the same ilvl, the problem remains.</div></div><hr />

That's not what they said in the briefing, quote:<br />
<br />
As you acquire Valor you'll want to spend it, and vendors will be offering a wide range of items to equip you to take on the Dragon Soul raid encounters, including cloaks, rings, ranged weapons, necklaces, trinkets, chest pieces, helms, gloves, bracers, boots, and belts, all of which are ilvl 397.<br />
<br />
No pants, or shoulders in there I'm afraid</div></div><hr />

I was hoping they were going to throw us a bone this time 'round with some craftable shoulders to help smooth the gap given the disparity between the JP shoulders and the RNG luck of tokens/drops, but I guess not. More bracers and pants, wooooooh. At least I'll only have once a week to appease the RNG gods for shoulders from LFR.</div></div><hr />

Probably not; they deliberately left them on tokens as incentive for people to do old raids if they want to complete their sets, and T11 raids aren't going anywhere.<br />
<br />
I know there are 378 plate DPS shoulders in the new 5-mans, which aren't great but better than 359. Not sure off the top of my head but I think there are 378s for most slots of most specs... shoulders are all I'm waiting for (damn you itemization team and your two offset tank shoulders but zero offset DPS shoulders).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple answer here: LFR will be pulling total randoms. Expect low skill quotient. Hence the lower difficulty. Don't like it, find a guild that DOES meet your play schedule. All you can do.<br />

<br />
Almost without fail the 3 new 5-mans will give a full gear set for each spec and armor type. There is a full tank plate, DPS plate, and healing plate set, for example. Every major slot nailed. Same goes for the rest. And yeah, being 378 is awesome. Mix in some of the 397 VP gear, 2pcT12 (maybe 13 if they put T13 Legs/Gloves on our new BH Loot Pinata), and go from there.</div></div><hr />

No reason for 4.0 and Zandalari to give 150 VP.<br />
<br />
It could potentially be a good move, returning dungeons to what they should have been in the first place. Everyone that just wants vp will queue for the fastest one while people who actually need gear from the others will queue for them. By indirectly forcing people to run something that they have no use for isn't fun and is quite frustrating. <br />
<br />
<br />
Making badge gear a consolation prize rather than a primary gearing method is a very good change as well.<br />
<br />

Hmm. Okay, so no-one is ever running Zandalaris ever again then. And being Valour capped from 7 random 5 mans? Excessive.

<br />
People that need za/zg gear to meet the queue reqs for the 4.3 five mans will still run them for a while. Additionally in the previous post or the one before that there was the mention of shortening troll dungeons so you only had to kill two animal avatars before hexlord in za and only two priests in zg before the last boss. So that might make things faster.</div></div><hr />

&quot;As you acquire Valor you'll want to spend it, and vendors will be offering a wide range of items to equip you to take on the Dragon Soul raid encounters, including cloaks, rings, ranged weapons, necklaces, trinkets, chest pieces, helms, gloves, bracers, boots, and belts, all of which are ilvl 397.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;While the Raid Finder will provide a lower difficulty for the Dragon Soul raids, and thus a lower ilvl of gear, the normal 10 and 25 raids will drop ilvl 397, with the final Deathwing encounters dropping ilvl 403. For the Heroic version, 10 and 25 will drop ilvl 410, and the Heroic Deathwing encounters will drop ilvl 416 loot.&quot;<br />

lol, sarcasm much, though you have a very valid point. Requirement for 4.0 HC's is like 330 ilevel I think? people will easily be out gearing that by 40 levels when we are few weeks in. <br />
<br />
Thing Blizz did wisely though is limit valor to 1k a week, that measn you spend 2 weeks and 200 valor for a chest piece upgrade (if prices stay the same)<br />
Try doing that for 6-7-8 slots and you're a whoooooooole lot of weeks on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing I always hated with the game, artificial slowing on progression. Whether or not you have 40 hours a week to play or 8, you still have to put in that time to get the reward, whats the difference if you done it all in a week over a month long period?<br />
<br />
---------- Post added 2011-10-05 at 04:51 AM ----------<br />
<br />
<br />
That'd be great for business, wouldn't it?<br />
<br />
No, it wouldn't be.<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is raids still have a 1 week lockout, consider doing hardmodes, I'd rather be quick to farm up alts or my main to be geared enough to participate in such not play the game, then be bored of it because I have to wait until the caps are undone.<br />
<br />
I think there is more player boredem and burnout when there is caps on things for the people who would like to play the game as much as the could, but aren't motivated to. Instead its an incentive not to play anymore for the week, thus making it seem boring in the meantime.<br />
<br />
<br />
Generally farming sucks, sucking because farming in WoW is something associated (rightfully so) with easy/guaranteed win, never any risk/reward at failing at it is all fairly predictable or static. Blizzard doesn't add new bosses or challenges every 1-4 weeks to their game, nor do they change how old bosses fight in mechanics for the sake of making new challenges for players to embark.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its a general problem with the game. I also find it bad for people's lives, luckily things are on a week basis over a day basis but still I hate being pressured into playing hours every day to week to reach the cap, even though I may not feel like it, so I can be &quot;caught up&quot; in case I am too busy or don't feel like playing for a week or two, you know? Or for at least more than the few raiding hours those weeks etc.<br />
<br />
---------- Post added 2011-10-05 at 05:03 AM ----------<br />
<br />
<br />
The cap is to keep the game balance. If they removed the cap the no life players who are on 24/7 would eclipse everyone else in terms of gear. Day 2 of patch and you have ppl in full current lvl gear? That is the major flaw of having an easily obtainable currency in any game. Gold not really counting cause it doesn't directly translate into top lvl gear, some prof. pieces, but that is about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
them being ahead is and will always be temporary, they still had to pour in hours to get there. I dont see the problem with letting some people who have the time and will able to do so. I think people just get jealous of these players or something.<br />
<br />
The argument of making content &quot;last&quot; longer seems more sound, but still its the same content, I think the thing this 6+ year old game people are not as intrigued to chase the carrot every time over long durations, but to get it while its fresh. I don't see as many focused on getting the absolute BiS gear over time, as much as getting an immediate upgrade to perform and settle til next x-pac.<br />
<br />
It makes a little more sense in PvP but still, think of it from this pov, you start a month or weeks late or leave for a period of time, no matter what you can NEVER catch up to regulars even if you put more time in, that cap holds you behind.<br />
<br />
If this was really an issue the idea formula would be cap general lifetime earned cap, that increases every day by date for all players. Say in December it will raise to be higher than currently, and refresh every patch.<br />
<br />
I doubt people just plan on gearing up fast as possible because they look forward to quitting the game immediately afterwards, if anything acquiring something through hard work is more inclining to keep you attached to it, people actually plan on using these items whether if its just to dress to impress, it still is for a purpose for their use in game.</div></div><hr />

I want it just the same as normal or heroic. Just because I can't necessarily make a solid time window for a Guild to run with, doesn't mean I am any less skilled (or unskilled) than a guild raider.<br />
<br />
In other words I dont want to raid, but I want to get phat lewts ?<br />
Dont be stupid, its not about low difficulty of dungeon so even noobs can raid - its about difficulty to get place in raid group, to make this raid group. Its about to beat all bosses, not to gather a raid for hour, wipe with pug on 2 first bosses for another hour, people leave and gg.<br />
Think about it.<br />

Stop putting caps on things... If people want to farm currency, let them.<br />

I really think there are quite few people who able to play 24\7 in WoW - Blizzard aim for casual community proves this point. So it seems if you and people like you will get bored and leave the game community overall and Blizzard wont lose much.<br />

Heroic Deadmines already give the same loot as Sinestra does (378~379) ?<br />

<br />
From what I've seen, shoulders are the obvious gap in gearing from points atm. &quot;including cloaks, rings, ranged weapons, necklaces, trinkets, chest pieces, helms, gloves, bracers, boots, and belts&quot; is what they said... assuming that list is everything, that leaves out: <br />
<br />
-Shoulders<br />
-Pants<br />
-Second Ring<br />
-Second Trinket<br />
-MH/OH items<br />
<br />
Pants can be purchased for justice (T12), as can the second ring and a second trinket. MH/OH items are rarely put on points vendors this expansion, though if you want there are still some blue off-hand options. That leaves just shoulders, which again you could fill with a blue item from points if you wanted to, but there are better options out there. <br />
<br />
Feels like alts will be getting weapons and shoulders from the new 5-man dungeons, everything else through valor (depending on what/how much you raid, of course).</div></div><hr />

Buf if you´re raiding heroic, it wont, because obviously 410 will be better than 397 and you will still want the 410 Piece for that slot. And if that Items just wont drop, you´re screwed and pissed off. Given the Fact that the Bosses seem to have an even wider spread Loot-Table (what with all the random set-drops that are supposed to replace t13) you´re propably going to wait for that 1 Piece for ages. Our guild has killed Baleroc heroic 12 times now. We´ve had 8 Drops of the completely useless Cloth-Shoulders that not a single class in the game wants or even considers useful. Still our 4 Casters still wait for the Trinket to drop. How about you find a solution to ease THIS frustration, Blizzard? How about upgradeable Valor-Stuff?</div></div><hr />

Consider yourself lucky. My guild got precisely ONE druid token during Tier 11 and it is the least dropped token during Tier 12.<br />

Warrior/Hunter/Shaman is the one that drops 6 out of 10 times for us, with Paladin/Priest/Warlock dropping 3 out of 10 (rough numbers). We have two hunters in full Tier 12, two shamans with 4p bonuses in TWO specs... and then there's me, who's still rocking a measly 2set bonus.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how happy I am about that, seeing as how you'll run out of options rather quickly, then LFR for valor doesn't even mean anything anymore.<br />
<br />
Basically, you get a full set of 397 gear and then, nothing... Unless you raid normal/heroic.<br />
<br />
Actually that's not what the post said. The post said gear will go like this: LFD -&gt; LFR -&gt; Normal Raid / Valor -&gt; Heroic Raid. Valor is now clumped in with normal raid as it has been all expansion, plus they even state it's the same level as what drops in normal.<br />
<br />
LFR will have higher quality look than 378 (LFD), but lower quality loot than normal raid (397). This leads to either the 384 or 391 iLvL's they implemented in Firelands which would be about even.</div></div><hr />

We think most players would agree that killing a giant monster and looting its corpse is more exciting than slowly farming a currency to purchase a reward. Currencies have their place, but we want them to be a secondary avenue of progression to boss killing. They vastly overestimate the excitement of downing a raid boss, or any boss for that matter. As in, after the first time it becomes an aggravation until you finally get what you want.

I hope so. Game should do some sorft of &quot;gear check&quot; of raid members before giving out loot. Tokens and other loot included.<br />
Thus if shoulder token boss goes down, let's say druid and mage are in 4T12, no rogue or DK in raid, game should exclude that token from RNG toss. Period.<br />
EDIT: Zephyr Storm said it a lot better :)<br />
<br />
That way all possible drops would be at least of same use.<br />
How many times in FL on boss firstkill our RG peeked at loot and stared at each other with &quot;wtf?&quot; look.<br />
Rogue items... but we have no rogue in group. Oh well. GZ Mr. Disenchant you loot ninja you...<br />
<br />
And since in 4.3 tier armor will be obtained only from raid boss tokens, gearing will take forever with current number of tokens per boss.<br />
Should be 2 in 10man and 5 in 25man. So 1 per 5 players.</div></div><hr />

Then remove the damned class tokens from the game and introduce universal tokens like in ToC. The guild can figure it out themselves who gets the token and who doesn't. With the RNG crap that we have right now, some classes see their class token drop maybe one or twice per 10-15 kills. Right now in Firelands we get about 60% of Warlock, Paladin, Priest tokens while the rest of the classes pick their noses.<br />
<br />
It's only going to be worse now that everything drops in Dragon Soul. I am happy that they are removing Tier items away from Valor, but their current obtain method is equally flawed, demoralizing and just bad in general. <br />

I think it would be safe to assume that I have bought all the valor pieces I can, prior to running raid bosses what incentive do I have to run 4.3 heroics. The chance of the group not being terrible and wiping is much lower than grouping 7 times for 4.0 heroics, and then using the valor to buy the new valor gear. Speaking of valor gear if it is a higher tier than the loot dropped during LFD, besides lore why would I even queue for LFD. Perhaps you need the chaos orbs watch the AH, being a LW I have about 100 orbs even after making stuff for my friends and the random person spamming in trade chat. I guess I will run the new heroics all at least once and then just go back to 4.0 and blow through those, stacking my valor for the new valor gear.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard will never give you a weapon that isn't a ranged slot for Valor.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I think the removal of tier pieces from Valor is yet another step backwards for WoW. I mean, literally a step backwards; that structure hasn't been the case since the end of TBC in 2008. Just like that, we're back at relying on the mercy of token drops to get our bonuses, and we're back at certain classes having offset pieces for all 3 specs before some classes get a single token. Hopefully Blizzard realizes this and makes the token universal ala TOC, but somehow I think the idea of 25 people rolling on a tier piece in Raid Finder will make them recoil in horror and they'll stay with the utterly stupid conq/prot/vanq system that is now 4 years old.</div></div><hr />

You say people may want to run HCs all day and get full 378 or whatever ultra-quickly but those who wouldn't will feel left behind, especially if they're just as competative when it comes to gear but don't want to put in hours of farming and as a result they will most probably feel forced to grind and grind and grind and feeling forced to do that is not what the game is about, in the end of the day it's about fun, and whilst gear is rewarding if you're not having fun doing it then something is wrong. Plus it stops people out-gearing content quicker thus making it last longer, the challenge is still there untill the routine nerfs and the fun is kept.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2011-10-05, 01:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What Blizzard REALLY needs to do is figure out something better than RNG on loot drops. I know it's been said a thousand times, but it's true. RNG is archaic in this day and age. For example, it's just plain stupid when you down a boss and say it drops plate gear, and everyone in the group can only wear mail or lower (feral tank in the group obviously). How about instead of saying,&quot;Oh that's RNG for you, better luck next time&quot;, they actually implement a system that tracks what kinds of classes (and maybe even specs) that are currently present in your group and have loot drop according to that? Makes a shit ton more sense to me, than seeing the same damn piece of loot drop, week after week after week, that everyone in your group keeps passing on because no one needs it. It really becomes ridiculous when it takes you half or more of a patch to get even MINOR upgrades for yourself because of RNG. Fix RNG Blizzard, and you will have fixed the loot issue. /nuff said<br />
<br />
Because since some classes can fill ALL roles, players could cheat the system to always drop what they need. Period.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard went back to the &quot;bring the spec, not the player&quot; system, that wouldn't be a problem since bringing 3 paladins, 4 druids, etc. would gimp you out of important buffs/debuffs and you would never down a boss.</div></div><hr />

It never made sense to have a full tier set, or a half tier set, available from a vendor in the first place.<br />
<br />
I would not get your hopes up, knowing blizzard ranged weapons means throwing and wands..just you watch. I doubt highly there will be bows etc, as there is no mention of melee weapons either. But cross your fingers I guess.</div></div><hr />

Everyone that just wants vp will queue for the fastest one while people who actually need gear from the others will queue for them. By indirectly forcing people to run something that they have no use for isn't fun and is quite frustrating. <br />
<br />
<br />
Making badge gear a consolation prize rather than a primary gearing method is a very good change as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People that need za/zg gear to meet the queue reqs for the 4.3 five mans will still run them for a while. Additionally in the previous post or the one before that there was the mention of shortening troll dungeons so you only had to kill two animal avatars before hexlord in za and only two priests in zg before the last boss. So that might make things faster.<br />
<br />
Never will be a good move. Only those who just say &quot;f$#@ the game, I want my epics&quot; would see that as good move. For the game by itself, it's a very bad and inconsistent move to award a 397 piece for doing a 329 dungeon.<br />
<br />
You do a 329 place to earn a 397 piece while when you're doing the raid itself (by LFR, since it's the same audience of LFD), you'll get gear lower than 397? Does that make any sense at all?<br />
<br />
By returning the dungeons to &quot;what they should have been&quot; would be just say &quot;bye bye, it was a good run&quot; for old ones and only focus on the new ones if you want the current content gear. By forcing it a lot, giving a little valor point for doing the old ones, but never to the extent to actually cap your valor the same way someone doing the actual 397 raid (or even the 3 378 heroics) would.<br />
<br />
This is not &quot;giving path options&quot; since you're not doing stuff of the same dificult level for it, it's just cheesing the system since the raids won't stay as something you will see only if you try it for real, because they'll probably nerf normal and heroic dragon soul as soon as Paragon defeats H-Deathwing the same way they did with FL. With the fact that LFR will be behind 4.0 heroics for ilvl gear will probably lead to this. Most of the players they're trying to please with this don't care about &quot;finishing a set&quot; or &quot;tier bonuses&quot;, they just want the highest ilvl possible for each slot to get their highest average ilvl possible (and not with the objective to down a raid boss). They won't be happy about &quot;seeing the content&quot; in LFR because it was just an excuse to demand the higher ilvl drops from the raids.<br />
<br />
It's like doing a random BG and earning your max conquest cap (not arena cap, but the rated bg one) the same way someone doing rated bg or arena. Random BG is a complete diferent thing than Rated BG/Arena. Sure players that fill the role I said earlier (f$%# the game, I want my purple) will say &quot;but that is excelent!&quot; In fact they would even agree with dropping conquest gear or h-deathwing ilvl gear from Vortex Pinnacle bosses, they don't care about the impact of that for the game.<br />
<br />
Think about it for a moment, what do you get for not playing the game? Nothing right? So, using logic, what do you get from current tier if you're not doing it? Nothing, right? Doing it a hell easier now, if you're not doing a single Cataclysm thing (you just stay there in Northrend, OL, etc... just do those dungeons forever), what do you get from Cataclysm? Nothing again. Now doing it a little harder, you're only doing 4.0 heroics and T11 raids, what do you get there? 397 or 346/359/372? 346/359/372! You don't want to do anything related to Dragon Soul patch, so there is no logic way to give you a path to earn it's gear. But Blizzard went to the extreme to award you a few valor points for doing 4.0 heroics and T11 heroic raids in 4.2. They said &quot;you shouldn't be earning anything related to the new content since you're not doing it, but we'll give you something anyway, altough it will take way more time since you wouldn't be getting anything anyway if we did it right&quot;.<br />
<br />
And they just threw that away by &quot;f#@$ this crap, get everything you want from everywhere!&quot; wich makes no sense and it's only there because right now, the group of players leaving the game is the one that say &quot;f$#@ the game, I want my epics&quot; and they just want to keep everyone. When the other types of players start leaving again (as they did after half of the WotLK), they will shift back to &quot;no guys, you need to earn that now&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Actually, this is not what this blue is saying at all. I don't want to run 5 man heroics every week just to get raid gear. That content is not challenging to me. Gone are the days of getting valor capped before the weekly raid so I can get gear. I am thankful for this. As the blue said, it's much more fun to get gear off a boss than run boring content over and over again.</div></div><hr />

If they removed the cap the no life players who are on 24/7 would eclipse everyone else in terms of gear. Day 2 of patch and you have ppl in full current lvl gear? That is the major flaw of having an easily obtainable currency in any game. Gold not really counting cause it doesn't directly translate into top lvl gear, some prof. pieces, but that is about it.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has stated multiple times that raid lock outs and point caps are not for game balance- though they do serve that purpose. They are actaully there to give people who feel they 'need' to raid in order to maintain some kind of status quo.<br />
<br />
It's true that nobody needs to raid, in any context. However, group participation does strange things to a person's psychology. Blizzard is merely acknowledging that fact by placing caps on how quickly these rewards can be earned.<br />
<br />
Though, for my two cents, I really dislike the idea of loot becoming more random. When Blizzard says it thinks people like looting something off of a giant boss corpse that it's somehow more fun than purchasing the item for some sort of currency, I couldn't disagree more. There's nothing inherently more fun about farming a raid boss over and over again in a group of 24 other strangers in the hope that the RNG will go your way, as opposed to farming the same heroic bosses over and over again, always knowing that if something decent doesn't drop for you, you're always getting closer to your goal of purchasing the piece. In fact, I rather prefer the choice I get to make when I use the points to select my gear. Waiting for it to randomly drop does absolutely nothing for me. Period.</div></div><hr />

IE: if you meet the 333 and 346 but not the (unannounced/guess) 352 then you'll randomly get original or zul for 150VP. The next outcry will be that you have to choose between queue specific for new heroics and 378 drops OR queue random for 150VP (with a small chance at getting the new ones as a bonus).</div></div><hr />

I once raided my ass off. All through TBC and through half of WOTLK it's all I did. I burned out so bad that the thought of raiding now threatens to give me hives. So don't try to FORCE me to raid. I know by not raiding I don't get the latest and greatest gear. I'm perfectly fine with being penalized by working 10x longer to get what I get through VP, but making certain things completely unobtainable without raiding is wrong. Tier 13 is about to drop and a whole lot of people seem to be highly offended at the thought that I might don a pair of Tier 11 shoulders without raiding. What difference does it make??

Unless they bump the droprates, you get 1 drop per 5 people in the raid (Tier tokens can break that rule), so on normal drops, there's no benefit. I'm not sure why the disparity in VP, though - I expected equal, but apparently not :)<br />
<br />
Edit: Oh, yeah, that OT post - interesting that they separated Tier and VP gear. Not sure if I approve yet - will have to see the loot tables, really! In principle, I don't care - if it's what they want to do, then fine.</div></div><hr />

Except that it says that the tier pieces will not be available from a vendor in the blue post. Blizzard has been saying the same thing since they began talking about 4.3. If you want T13, you have to raid.<br />

Blizzard has been saying the same thing since they began talking about 4.3. If you want T13, you have to raid.<br />
<br />
I am really ok with the &quot;if you want T13 you have to raid&quot; concept. But this is just a broken way to fix the problem. Its a decent chance even raiders won't have T13 bonuses anytime soon.<br />
<br />
Current loot drops half the time don't drop items for individuals within the group. I really don't mind losing rolls, but not to ghosts. Take away the set bonuses at the vendor, alright sweet, now make it so at least one thing drops that someone can use within the raid.</div></div><hr />

Stop putting caps on things... If people want to farm currency, let them.<br />
<br />
That makes no sense. The caps exist so people can't blow through content/loot/etc. Hence the Sunwell gating, ICC gating...the caps are always going to be there.</div></div><hr />

LFR would be too much of a time sink for me - The potential frustration that would come from playing with idiots will not be worth my time. This is one guy who will not be using the LFR tool -- I'll stick to my guild. However, it is a great addition for those who do not have the luxury of being able to devote to a set raiding schedule.. finally a tool to separate the 'casual' from the 'raider'.. and hopefully a medium that will make both crowds happy!<br />
<br />
-also if I am not mistaken, the LFR gear will be recolored (think I read that somewhere)</div></div><hr />

Yes, congratulations to Blizzard for releasing one less tier of raid content in this expansion. this is the only reason the gap is smaller.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ganush</div><div class="date">2011-10-05, 06:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think they pretty much nailed it.<br />
<br />
Valor cap seems fair to me. I don't care if you raid to get your 397's, but they shouldn't be handed out overnight. If they do this, everyone who power farmed all the VP gear would be whining the next week that they were bored and where's the new content.<br />
<br />
Having to raid to get your tier gear is also fair. My guess is the RF runs will actually turn out to be easier than ZA/ZG have been, so their won't be many fail groups. If you want higher levels of tier gear, then you have to raid regulars or heroics. Very fair.<br />
<br />
iLevels seem to be pretty much perfect. You can run the new dungeons and RF to get to 378 (maybe 384 as the lack of a statement on that indicates to me they haven't decided on RF gear lvl), which is what regular heroics will be tuned to. New players can get to a current content gear level fairly easily and quickly if they want.<br />
<br />
Having VP drop from all the heroics is good. As a raider, if I have to fill in my last few VP with a random, I don't necessarily want to spend a lot of time doing it. Quite frankly, some of my most enjoyable times in Wrath were rofl-stomping heroic dailies with a group of overgeared guildies. Sometimes it's fun to just roll through stuff, not have to pay attention and joke around with friends. I welcome this back.<br />
<br />
This system seems fair to all types of players, and may just put the fun back into my guild. I say they may have finally hit the sweet spot.</div></div><hr />

Blahahhaha... What? Really? Stop putting caps on things so everyone feels forced to run stuff until they are blue in the face? How in what world is that fair? It's why they got rid of 10 and 25 being on separate locks. They felt like people were pressured or forced to do things that may not have been in their best interests. In this case, if you allow VP to be farmable, all you do now is make it to where people again feel pressured that they have to farm something. <br />
<br />
&quot;Guild Leader says: Hey guys, I know this is going to suck, but I need you guys to farm VP all day. We need about 12,000 VP each to gear out all of our slots to make the content easier. Soooo, if you dont do it, you may not be invited. Thanks.&quot;<br />

Well, why not queue up for LFR then. I'm guessing difficulty level will be on par with heroics, and you could conceivably get your tier gear faster.</div></div><hr />

pretty much this, if you're worried you don't have time to raid you can also just queue up and conceivably just do 2 bosses or something, people worry too much.</div></div><hr />

It's been used a lot but I'll say it too: what use is gear to you if you don't/can't raid.<br />
<br />
Exactly, so bind the gear to be used in raid environments only. Basically, stats revert back to 0 outside of a raid environment. After all, what use is gear to you if you don't/can't raid&quot;.<br />
Personally though, I don't mind the changes. You get a different way to get the same exact ilvl gear as you would from doing normal raids without raiding. I think its a good trade off if you can't or won't raid. No one persons gear is going to be that much more overpowering over another persons gear in or out of that raid environment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If Blizzard went back to the &quot;bring the spec, not the player&quot; system, that wouldn't be a problem since bringing 3 paladins, 4 druids, etc. would gimp you out of important buffs/debuffs and you would never down a boss.<br />
<br />
That's the POINT. When you kill a boss, it should drop loot that someone in your group can actually USE. Not some damn trinket or such that no one needs and it just gets DE'ed every freaking week, for months on end. Who cares if a group runs with 3 paladins and 4 druids who are all specced differently? They would get loot to drop for them, just like a diverse group would get loot to drop for them as well....just as long as the loot that drops is RELEVANT to the group that is there. Other people have stated their examples of how you can raid for weeks and months on end and NEVER get the tier token or specific loot drop that you need because of the lame-ass RNG that Blizzard seems to think is the best idea ever. We need a loot system that takes into account what the party is made up of, and then drop loot accordingly.<br />
<br />
Will groups get geared faster and burn through content faster that way? Well, yeah...duh. That's the point. Because that is a hell of a lot better than it taking two to three times as long, grinding the same shit over and over again, annoying the hell out of you and making you want to rage quit, because the RNG won't ever drop what you freaking NEED. Might mean a bit less money in Blizzard's pocket in the long haul, but it will make a hell of a lot more customers happy.<br />
<br />
And I would love to see anyone say that they enjoy having to farm content for-freaking-ever just to get 1 or 2 items to finally drop for them (they'd be lying through their teeth if they said they did). No one enjoys that. It's just frustrating and annoying as hell. It's time consuming and in the end, even if you finally get the loot, it's usually soon replaced by gear in the next patch...because it took you so damn long to get it in the first place.<br />
<br />
RNG is a bitch and needs to die a horrible and painful death. Getting rid of it would only improve the game. For everyone.</div></div><hr />
