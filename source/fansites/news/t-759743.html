Archaeology Rewards 
Let's directly jump to rewards, that's the only thing most people care about! As explained in an earlier blue posts, Blizzard changed their mind and decided to reward people with a few epic weapons/armors along with the cosmetic items.

Archaeology Rewards<br />
Let's directly jump to rewards, that's the only thing most people care about! As explained in an earlier blue posts, Blizzard changed their mind and decided to reward people with a few epic weapons/armors along with the cosmetic items. <br />
<br />
1. Bind on Account Epic Items<br />
Archaeology gives you epics! Of course, these artefacts will be fairly rare but with enough work you should be able to acquire a nice set of epic weapons and armors, including lvl 85 ones. This list of rewards might not be complete at this point<br />

2. Mounts<br />
The Scepter of Az'Aqir (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92148/scepter-of-azaqir/) got a lot of attention when I first posted about it but isn't the only mount you can find. <br />
<br />

3. Companion Pets<br />
3 Companion pets are available from Archaeology. <br />

<br />
<br />
So far it looks like the Crawling Hand will be the most interesting one, especially for alliance players who already have an endless supply of gnomes slaves and won't be interested in a mechanical version. Below is a small preview of the animations of the Crawling Hand / Mummified Monkey Paw (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92137/mummified-monkey-paw/)<br />

4. Miscellaneous Items<br />
Archaeology also rewards you with a lot of lore-oriented items, they're not really useful and are just here for fun. A lot of them aren't implemented yet and the only thing I can really get out of this is the model of the transformations. <br />
<br />

Archaeology - How it works<br />
Ghostcrawler wrote an awesome post about how Archaeology works and I don't think there is much more to add, maybe a couple of screenshots. <br />
Archaeology just went in this build for the first time and we don't yet have any of the support around it to teach players what to do. It has been informative to watch players learn to swim by drowning, but we thought it was time to offer a little more direction. :)<br />
<br />
Digsites<br />
Once you train archaeology, you can see digsites on your map (not your minimap - your map). There are always 4 digsites per continent. These will not change until you dig one out. Most of the time, you're probably only going to be concerned with the 4 sites on your current continent, but at higher character and archaeology skill levels, there will be 16 sites active at one time (4 each in Eastern Kingdoms, Kalimdor, Outland and Northrend.)<br />
<br />
You will only find sites in zones of your level or lower. A level 25 player will have all 4 sites per continent in level 25 zones. (This means Outland and Northrend will have no sites at this time.) A level 80 player will have all 4 sites in any zone. A low level Kalimdor player might have sites in Ashenvale and Stonetalon, while a level 82 might have Uldum, Ashenvale, Stonetalon and Silithus.<br />
<br />
Sites are race specific. You can usually guess the race by the location. Kalimdor tends to have a lot of night elf ruins. Eastern Kingdoms tends to have a lot of dwarf ruins.<br />
<br />
Some races are only available on some continents (such as orc and draenei on Outland). You need to have a minimum character level and a minimum archaeology level to use these. Currently you can see them if you are a certain character level but can't gather from them until your archaeology skill is higher. For Outland, the skill is 300. While somewhat consistent with other gathering skills, we think this is confusing and we will change it so that you don't even see the digsites until your archaeology skill is sufficiently high. Tol'vir artifacts are the most rewarding, but also require near max archaeology skill to recover.<br />
<br />
Some players are reporting some issues with digsites not showing up correctly. We'll look into these bugs.<br />
<br />
Unlike other gathering skills, digsites are player-specific. Other players will be searching in different locations. There is no competition for digsites.<br />
<br />
Fragments<br />
Each digsite can be searched 3 times before it despawns and a new site spawns. If there is a digsite somewhere too far away from you or otherwise inconvenient, just ignore it and hit the closer ones. You won't run out.<br />
<br />
To search a digsite, use the Survey ability. The survey tool will spawn and point in the approximate direction of the artifact. Red means you're far away. Yellow means you're close. Green means you may be within 40 yards or so. When you discover your find, you'll get fragments specific to a particular race.<br />
<br />
There are two main strategies to surveying. You can attempt to triangulate by moving around the outer edge of a digsite. (Like quest blobs, the digsites are not necessarily circular.) Other players just keep surveying, heading in the direction the tool points until they strike paydirt.<br />
<br />
Remember, the thing you uncover is yours. There is no competition with other players and nobody can gank your node.<br />
<br />
Artifacts<br />
Whenever you get a new fragment for a race, you'll start a research project. You can only work on one artifact per race at a time. When you have enough fragments, click Solve to complete that artifact. You won't waste excess fragments -- they will just start the next project. You can be working on one project for each race at a time.<br />
<br />
Most artifacts are common. These give you a little bit of lore or flavor text and an item you can sell for a small profit (presumably to a museum!) The profit increases as the value of the artifact increases. You can estimate this by the number of fragments needed to finish the artifact. You will only find cheaper artifacts at low level, but you can find cheap and valuable artifacts at higher level (the reason for this is we want players to be able to find all the artifacts if they want to). You won't find a second copy of a common object until you have found all the artifacts of that race. If you get stuck at a certain skill level of archaeology or character level, you may find an artifact more than once until you reach the next tier.<br />
<br />
Some artifacts are rare. These always make a blue or purple item. Many of these have no in-game power and are toys or for flavor. Some of them are actual weapons and armor. The latter items are all bound to account. They aren't heirlooms in that they don't scale, but you can pass them around. So if you are level 80 and you find a level 60 axe, you can always have another character use it when they are level 60. You will never get a rare artifact more than once.<br />
<br />
The future<br />
We designed archaeology to be easily expandable, so we plan to add much more content in future patches, including new races to research (though to be fair, there's a sizable amount of content already). We also have a feature that is not available on beta yet, that allows you to use your archaeology skill for a slight (think Fish Feast-level) bonus in the Cataclysm dungeons. <br />

AQ20 is a 10-player raid in Cataclysm<br />
ZG is being removed as a L60 raid. Havent heard anything about AQ20 though.<br />
AQ20 has been converted to a 10 player raid. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26560501163/guild-achievements-for-classic-dungeons-raids/))<br />
<br />
Reforging on 4.0.1 PTRs<br />
We've been creating a lot of builds lately for 4.0.1 and Cataclysm beta, so Reforging NPCs may not yet be available. As with all PTR processes, the patch notes are not comprehensive. Some changes may not be reflected in the notes, while others may not yet be available in the current build.<br />
<br />
If Reforging is not yet active, it should be in an upcoming build. We want to give players a chance to try out the new feature. With all of the class changes going in, Reforging will allow players the opportunity to customize their gear a bit more before Cataclysm actually ships. It will also allow you to add Mastery to existing items if you so choose. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726037173/reforging-where/))<br />
<br />
World Changes / New Race and Class combinations in Patch 4.0.1<br />
The world will not be changing in patch 4.0.1. We are planning to apply those changes in patch 4.0.3 shortly before Cataclysm launch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726037173/reforging-where/))<br />
<br />
[...] New race/class combinations and changes to the old world (including quests) should be patch 4.0.3. I know it's kind of confusing since we typically release one major patch right before the release of the next expansion. In this case, many of the systems changes will be added in 4.0.1, while a lot of content changes will be added in 4.0.3.<br />
<br />
The expansion will then provide players with access to the new races, new zones, level 85 cap, flight in Azeroth, Archaeology, etc. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726037173/reforging-where/))<br />

This is still a possibility, but it's probably not something we're going to do immediately with the release of Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26850274802/reduced-xp-from-70-to-80-blue-plz/))<br />

Guild XP for boss kills<br />
Guild xp for boss kills is scaled on a few factors.<br />
<br />
- Boss level<br />
- Normal / Heroic<br />
- Amount of guild members present (more xp for raids, since they are limited to once a week)<br />
<br />
Hope this helps. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26435397268/leveling-speed/))<br />

Spamming cheap heals in Cataclysm<br />
Right now on the Beta videos a lot of the healers seem to be spamming the weak &quot;Heal&quot; for 90% of the time. So spamming is ok and we are expected to spam for most of the fight as long as what we're spamming is a weak spell? is this truly what is intended for Cata healers?<br />
No, that's not the intent. We made those heals very cheap so that healers wouldn't be in constant terror of running out of mana. We also are making the normal modes easier than the heroic modes. You'll have to pair the right heal for the right situation to a greater degree in heroic modes. I think part of what you're seeing is that healers are using the base heal because they can get away with it. It's also possible that in our effort to distinguish them from the more expensive heals that we made the base heals too cheap or efficient.

Arcane Mastery<br />
According to Kavan on EJ, this theory of aiming to maintain your mana above some percentage is wrong anyways. If there was a magical percentage, it would be 40% because the idea is to gradually ramp up your cycle's mps as you get closer and closer to using evocation. What matters is the time at which your evocation comes off cooldown, not some magical percentage point at which mastery becomes more or less effective.<br />
I think that's more accurate. Generally speaking, the approach is something along the lines of...<br />
<br />
Evocation and mana gem are available at the start so you burn some mana quickly, use gem and dps cooldowns, burn more down to 40%, evoc back to 100%, play conservatively until mana cooldowns are available, burn more, then come back up and play conservatively, then nearing the end of the fight you try to time your burn down once again to match the end of the fight. <br />
<br />
I like arcane mastery because it adds some depth to an otherwise shallow spec. It changes the way I play mid encounter in a controlled way as opposed to stupid stuff like hot streak where I just hope for the best. I will be making some mistakes (none as dumb as waiting until 20% mana to evocate or using arcane missiles every time it's up LULZ), gradually over time I'll get bored and look into / math out minor details and make fewer/smaller mistakes.<br />
Yeah, that. My gut says it'll be very hard for players to perfectly optimize their fights since optimal behavior will be different from fight to fight and further vary based on mastery level, but most players will (hopefully) be able to use general guidelines to get reasonable results from the spec.

Slam Scaling<br />
It's not important to keep Slam scaling with haste so long as Arms scales with haste. It's only a problem if you'd get to the point of dropping Slam from your rotation or something, which we think is unlikely. We'll make sure Heroic Strike never eclipses Slam. Heroic Strike isn't supposed to be a button you're ever excited about pushing at the expense of something else. It's just there so the rage doesn't go to waste.

<br />
Blood Frenzy<br />
That Blood Frenzy changes lets us give Arms as much rage as needed from haste to make sure that haste is valuable from the resource-generation side. It's already valuable from the damage side -- it is not the case that increasing haste is a dps loss for Arms. I realize you might have made this post before mine in the beta forum. The challenge of communicating in two places at once. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726035459/warrior-changes-12942-and-t11-bonuses/))<br />
<br />
Arms Rotation<br />
The Arms rotation is Rend, Colossus Smash, Mortal Strike and Slam, with Overpower and additional Colossus Smash procs, and Heroic Strike as a rage dump. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/26726035459/warrior-changes-12942-and-t11-bonuses/))</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I can't help but notice the &quot;illusion&quot; items. Two issues with those: 1) The short duration/long cooldown. I've had beef with this since Day 1 of WoW. It should be clear why when you look at Noogenfogger and Deviate. 2) This, yet again, counters the blue comment made in the Overcloaks thread.<br />
<br />
I could go on, but I've found beating my head against a wall only leaves me with a headache and no answers.<br />
<br />
Also, interesting that 4.0.3 will introduce the world changes. Does that mean we can expect 4.0.1 within the next few weeks? ICC10/25 will be so ridiculously easy (and I've heard rumor that the buff will be going up again, but I've seen nothing myself to confirm this).<br />

Why would they be for level one? They have level restrictions. They are like any other epic, only difference is that you can send it to one of your other characters but can't sell it. Seems fairly straight forward.</div></div><hr />

Nope, that was the very first thing I thought of when i saw it:) Archeology is shaping up to be possibly the greatest thing in WoW, at least lorewise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe it's only for the looks? But why isn't it a stat-less level 1 then?<br />
There are various reasons:<br />
1. After a few months you'll have trouble getting groups for instances below lvl 85 heroics. Trying to get enough emblems / hero points for gear while leveling will be rather pointless. You'll do most instances once for the quests and then move on. Most gear for your alts will be from questrewards and whatever your main sends you.<br />
2. These things are good items for their level. This means you only need 1 for all your chars that can use it when leveling instead of locked to one char compared to &quot;normal&quot; epic and blues you can send to alts to help leveling.<br />
3. The problem with Heirlooms (for Bliz' perspective) is that you don't want any other item in that slot from lvl 1 to 84. These new boa epics are only for a few levels and then content drops can take over again. So a small boost for your alt, but not as stupid overpowered as Heirlooms.</div></div><hr />

It's not something you're going to farm.<br />
You can stumble on them unexpectedly.<br />
And then go 'Oh, my alt can use that!'<br />
That's the whole point, surprising you. If you're really trying to farm this you'll be looking for a while.</div></div><hr />

You're being literal with this, Blizzard doesn't want you to be able to modify their armor to make up your own sets, or take cloak A and place an over cloak over it hiding the original look of the cloak.<br />
They do pay attention to people who RP and want more immersion, and did state they are looking into having something to add a little more variety to your apparel.<br />

You're not the only one who's playing WoW, do not forget that... there are tons of people who like to read about lore and stuff... do something here and there with friends and guildies...<br />

It's a secondary profession, you don't grind it for epics. You don't grind it if you don't like it. It's for people who enjoy traveling around and are interested in fun/lore items. The epics are just a nice surprise, like someone already said before me.<br />

Yeah, we had one of those Scarab Lords transfer to our realm. He spent most of his time idling on the mount, in full Lawbringer armor. <br />

I've been tsting it on the beta and ys, I agree with you. It's fun the first time you &quot;do&quot; it, then it feels a bit pointless. Unless you're a lore-player (in which case it's very good) in my opinion is completely useless and tine-wasting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is mindbending to hear people complain about timewasting in an online game like WOW, its nothing but timewasting. Almost anything you can do is less of a timewaste than wow. I actually have trouble thinking of anything more timewasting than WOW, thats how much it is a complete waste of time. Funny of course but still a waste of time.<br />

I enjoy it a lot. It's far from boring- it's not just &quot;Go to place, search, get item 3x, and then go to next place&quot;. It's a bit of puzzle solving- the red-yellow-green system is pretty intuitive and works out very well. The &quot;lore items&quot; (things that aren't the pets, vanity items, or mounts), are also fun to read if you're big into the background, which I am.<br />
Good intention, pretty good execution, I'm a big fan of it. Plus I can't wait to make my warlock a dwarf, with an Explorers' League background, and go searching everywhere for goodies, hee hee. (Yes I play on an RP server, shh.)<br />
Also, AQ20 = AQ10? Is... is it staying level 60, then, or are they revamping it and also going to make it an 80 raid? That doesn't seem very clear, but I am VERY interested. I love AQ20.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's... called updating the game. Do you honestly know anyone, save maybe the one group of &quot;old world raiders&quot; on your server, that go into ZG on the 3-day timer basis to raid? (And actually RAID the place at level 60, not just a few 80s going for mount runs). Were you angry when they made so many of the old classic items (Arcanite Reaper? Headmaster's Charge?) that were either incredibly rare drops or required a lot of mat farming were made into BoA legacy gear? Zin'Rokh was a fantastic item... back in Vanilla. There's been two expansions since, and the new item is coming out in the third. I bet you there's a large chunk of folks who never even saw that original sword now on servers. <br />
<br />
I really have no idea how updating a single weapon is &quot;ENTIRELY RUINING THE GAME FOREVER AND EVER AMEN&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Great incentive to work on Archeology (as well as the flavor items). Though I am curious about one thing.<br />
Since my main is a Death Knight, will it be possible to Runeforge these weapons (the two hand sword in particular) or will I have to rely on regular enchants? I'm sure Blizzard won't want my Warrior or Paladin alt to gain access to Rune of the Fallen Crusader.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I believe they want to keep flying mounts as end game rewards for PvErs and PvPers. Thats why they are giving away ground mounts for things such as Archeology. Also ground mounts are cool for BGs.</div></div><hr />

Removing ZG and making the classic sword lvl 85. And BoA...GG blizz, you continue your downward spiral of ruining the game, much like this site was ruined when it got sold out.<br />
<br />
I solo Zul'Gurub every reset and kill everything, including Hakkar. Zin'Rokh has dropped for me three times and each time I have sold it since I needed the gold more than extra clutter in my bank.<br />
I think it's great that the sword is being retuned to a level 85 BOA weapon instead of being some glorified vendor item. Especially since the original version is being removed once the ZG raid gets axed.<br />
Stop living in the past. If you don't like it, then just leave.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a secondary profession, you don't grind it for epics. You don't grind it if you don't like it. It's for people who enjoy traveling around and are interested in fun/lore items. The epics are just a nice surprise, like someone already said before me.<br />
<br />
People keep thinking this game is all about epics and gear. I for one love to just fly/run around the world and ejoy the scenery when I'm not doing endgame.<br />
<br />
I would rather just fucking log off, tbh.<br />

If the Archeology rewards are that powerful, I can easily see any remotely serious guild requiring all its members to have Archeology going into the first tier of Cataclysm. That is, similar to how adding the profession bonuses in Wrath turned primary professions from something fun and rewarding, to min/max stat vending machines. (&quot;ZOMG you're losing out on 10 HEP with those professions, why don't you have JC/BS?!&quot;)<br />
<br />
That's not to say I dislike Archeology or won't do it, I just hate it when &quot;optional&quot; new mechanics are introduced, whose original intention was to add some fun, that are essentially turned into a requirement because of a meaningless stat boost or some other perk. Especially since, knowing Blizz, my guild will make me spend thousands of gold leveling this so I can go with them into T11 content with a crafted 359 staff, and promptly replace it with a 364 staff as soon as we down the first boss.<br />
<br />
I guess what I'm saying is, secondary professions should be purely fun/optional/profitable, and the best way to keep it this way is to not make them have any tangible PVE benefits.</div></div><hr />

Sure it's epic so the stats might be a little bit better than a heirloom (which should be comparable to a blue), so it might be useful for level 60-65 perhaps, but who will go through the trouble of getting it through archeology when you can just farm some (emblems/hero points?) for heirloom gear.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's only for the looks? But why isn't it a stat-less level 1 then?<br />
<br />
I think it's just that as you're leveling archeology and IF you happen to get one of these lower level epics that you CAN use it on alt. Then again, maybe you wouldn't, the choice is yours. The point is it wouldn't be worthless. I shouldn't think that it's specifically something you would go farming for though. You're right, if you NEEDED a certain thing on your level 60ish character you'd be better off getting it some other way.</div></div><hr />

Good guilds will be able to handle the content without these epics and good guilds don't demand people to change professions so you get 20 more hp or whatever. Join a better guild instead.<br />

Also - with will cost in Archaeology? If anything, you will be able to make some cash out of it - especially if you are playing on a RP realm.</div></div><hr />

I have been following news about Cata, archeology included obviously. From what I hear in videos on youtube it takes shitload of time, like really a lot to even get over 200 skill. Now, that is ok, I like things taking time ingame because I dont sit in Dala but do something. But... In the end all Archeology provides will be some low level epic gear (aka equivalent to todays Titansteel Destroyer) and 2 mounts? Or am I missing something? Like some stat bonus, glyph/gem slot, extra talent (points), nothing like that?<br />
<br />
Because if I am right I dont get why is this even a (secondary) profession :o. Fishing, Cooking and First Aid obviously provide a lot at high skill and are sure as hell worth skilling up but this doesnt even fit into professions imo...<br />
<br />
edit: overall I am not bashing or badmouthing Archeology and I sure as hell will skill it up because I like having my main totally maxed.<br />
<br />
I get what you're saying, but the whole thing is brand new right? Surely Blizz can add a metric ton of stuff, and surely at higher levels (and as we go forward) there will be more awesome things to find. As for the time sink (and I agree it is one) I don't have a problem with it. It's something different when you just don't feel like farming, and we'll all have about 2 years to kill before the next expansion anyway. :D</div></div><hr />

Blah. Is this true? Does it actually say Horde only? It's hard to imagine that Blizz would do that. They can do player specific digsites, but not have you only discover mounts usable by your own faction? Maybe it's a bug?</div></div><hr />

But I can't help but notice the &quot;illusion&quot; items. Two issues with those: 1) The short duration/long cooldown. I've had beef with this since Day 1 of WoW. It should be clear why when you look at Noogenfogger and Deviate.<br />
<br />
The short duration/long CD is obviously done by design after all this time. I agree with it, though - makes things more &quot;special&quot;. In my opinion.<br />

The thing is that it's randomly powerful. Your Warrior could get the awesome two handed sword two days after hitting 525 Archeology, or two months after. Or never. If the first happens, sweet, bonus epic. If the second happens any semi-serious raider will have better by then anyway. It's like the Green Protodrake. Weeks of farming rep, months of buying eggs and I still don't have one (granted I eventually gave up). My guildie got one on his second egg. On the other hand I got Rivendare's horsie on my third Strat run. Random is random, Archeology will be random. Even if a guild tried to force you to farm for the epics, they really can't see anything more than whether you hit max level. After that just keep telling them you have crappy luck and keep getting cheesy items.</div></div><hr />

I think the Qiraji mount is just a place holder right now, although I guess you could call that color Ultramarine.<br />
I'm really tired of people complaining about the Scarab Lord, ours transfered and in addition to that no longer plays. I don't lodge a complaint with Blizz that 1) our realm did not bug when patch 3.0.2 was released, and the bug closed the gates, and you were once again able to do this quest and the 10 Hour War. All related quests were also made available, however, you did not have to gather supplies. and 2)Guilds that farmed thousands of silithids,hundreds of dragons, dozens of MC creatures, thousands of gold worth of mats got nothing at all but one person with a mount and a title(if you were really lucky, perhaps more than one in the 10 hours you had). <br />
<br />
I've wanted to be able to ride a battle tank outside of AQ ever since I got my first one in AQ, so as one of the remaining people who actually did the work for that quest chain....congrats if you're someone who got it the legit and horrible way, /jealous if you managed to exploit the 3.0.2 bug, and please stop kicking the dead legendary horse, it's turned into mashed horse and there's a whole pile of dead horses you can beat about other ridiculous complaints.</div></div><hr />

Archaeology: Zin'rokh, Destroyer of Worlds<br />
According to your research, this great weapon was one of the many treasures of Hakkar the Soulflayer in Zul'Gurub. Hakkar was defeated years ago and this sword passed through the hands of many powerful warriors and paladins before apparently becoming sundered. It is remarkable that you have been able to reforge it, but also a little troubling that if the Destroyer of Worlds has returned, PERHAPS THE SOULFLAYER IS NOT FAR BEHIND.<br />

No, They have iLVLs if you look. Treat it like a heirloom item just more epic lol. You get it with your mage toon who has max arch. You then send to your pally to use as a opening ret weapon at lvl 85. Then yous end it from him to your warrior for him to use at 85. Or you can sell them.

AQ20 can be 2 manned right now so lowering the top end to 10 people has 0 effect on anything. Also, archaeology sounds hard to level and the mount will be a very rare artifact so all the doom and gloomers are blowing things WAY out of proportion.</div></div><hr />
