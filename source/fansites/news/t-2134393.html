They didn't do anything to improve the bad ones. They are still bad. People will still complain and leave. There's nothing good in having Sephuz, Bel'ovir, Prydaz, Norgannon's Shoes, even Cord of Infinity. Nothing at all, they wasted your farming time, meanwhile others got BiS.<br />

<br />
<br />
Mate, when you have absolutely no fucking idea what you're talking about, you should shut the fuck up. First, fire mage, live or PTR, is middle of the pack at best on single target. Secondly, and that's where I know you have no fucking idea what you're driveling about, if fire bracers where anywhere below 250%, they would become a dps loss. Hardcasting a pyro for 5 sec for a mediocre spell, even buffed at 200%, is way less effective than doing your normal rotiation.</div></div><hr />

Prydaz is still buffed compared to what it is on live atm. Currently on live it's 15% of health if you don't take damage for 5 seconds. Now it's going to be 25% of health every 30 seconds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
?<br />
<br />
Looking at Fire &quot;DPS&quot; legendaries, TW ring and DB head have been unchanged, the belt got a buff and bracers got a nerf both in modifier reduction and synergies as they get much less procs now(crit reduction) and the removal of Ice Floes.<br />
<br />

Oh and btw were gonna shit on most of your classes cause we have this sweet aura that buffs all your abilities that makes it look like your going to get 5-10% dmg buff but then were nerf that to in a later patch so stay tuned!!</div></div><hr />

Now the devs nerf the legendaries that are considered to be much better than the other to even the gap between bad and good ones which is an awesome change, and people still whine. <br />

They've even stated they will tune the classes after the nerfs to the legendaries to ensure that specs come out net-neutral or close to. Stop fucking whining</div></div><hr />

<br />
No choice.<br />
<br />
Pretty much, but that is the problem with the system. In raid enviroment as a DPS only class, as long as there is a DPS upgrade available, you will take it over everything, unless you die if you don't take a defensive option. I'd much rather have no legendaries and some of the passives baked into the spec, but this is what we've been given, sadly.</div></div><hr />

And they said they're buffing the ghouls by 33%, but that is absolutely fucking terrible considering they also nerfed the amount of ghouls we get and bracers.<br />
<br />
Mind u that this is in total a buff to unholy. It lowers the RNG factor by ALOT. if u crapped out on 3 attacks in a row you can still Apoc now which is WAAAAY better for the low end RNG.<br />
<br />
Other that that. This is a pure 33% inc in damage on Army of the Dead.<br />
<br />
A good buff for sure. Enough? Nah, still problem is sustain damage as unholy but a buff for sure still</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wtf &quot;crazily good&quot;...? Nerfing them from 300 to 250 brings them to the border of &quot;is still a dmg increase&quot;.. If Blizz nerfs them under 250, you can throw them away.<br />
<br />
Considering that mages needed the 300% bracers to be able to do somewhat competitive ST damage just shows how stupidly bad the class is without them..<br />
<br />
Edit. I don't know where you're going with your rant about the bracers.. The moment, the bracers are nerfed &lt;250% they'll become a stat stick and most likely land on the bank at a point in the future.<br />
<br />
Edit. 2: And no, I don't even own the bracers. I got the helmet, the damn CC ring and the stupid chest piece.. x_x</div></div><hr />

The problem remains where people's optimal performance is tied to rng in which there are still bad and good draws which eat your built up chance to get something. Just the difference now between people with good and people with bad legendaries (or lack of) will be slightly smaller. The bad experience with getting useless one and being tied to rng remains.</div></div><hr />

They said that some legendaries are overpowered and others are totally underpowered, or just pure shit. Instead of improving the the shittiest legendaries and try to balance positively, they nerf the best legendaries so any legendary is good at all.<br />
<br />
Blizzard if u do that, at least, please, fix some stats of the items, I mean change the ayala stone heart stats of crit for haste, that is bis(or almost bis) for every warrior spec. I don't know the rest of the classes, but these changes on legendaries seems to nerf the total dmg by a lot.<br />

They only increase the Ret Paladin damage by 12 % because, Greater Blessing of Might is being removed (You can see that on Wowhead post).<br />
<br />
So now we only have Wisdom and Kings left and can only cast it on one target.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I thought part of the issue was huge power surges &quot;behind RNG legendarys&quot;?<br />
<br />
Apparently not!<br />
<br />
If the issue is that difference between someone with a &quot;good&quot; legendary and someone with none is too large, then yes, it is fully expected to see nerfs rather than buffs. Mathematically we're never in a million years going to see all legendarys being overall balanced to each other, there will always be the &quot;BiS&quot; &quot;mandatory&quot;, so making them a bit less impactful is a more reasonable change.</div></div><hr />

Wtf?! Sephuz is great now! I play Fury, it procs on charge. Playing Solo its a blast. Additionally to the insane burst i'll get some extra 25% beststat+ 75% movementspeed for 10secs. and this every 30 secs. World questing and world pvp is pure joy with it. Not to mention its benefits in M+. For raids you can still equip another ring.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter if things are middle of the pack what the fuck they are nerfing things that are at the bottom and they don't give a shit. Stop replying with irrelevant bullshit like where fire mages currently are as it doesnt matter one bit to what i'm saying<br />

Pretty shitty considering it's not even that great compared to other legendaries. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's still a god tier legendary, even at 250%. Personally, I would've reduced the chance for it to activate, hell even 10% would be better than the 20%. <br />
<br />
I currently have Belo'virs and Prydaz, so i'm basically the absorb queen with like 70% shields (with ice barrier) <br />
<br />
I do think bracers still need a bigger nerf. If they are already nerfing legendaries that are currently underpowered (compared to the god tier ones) then these need to also be worked on too, it's just not fair<br />
<br />
These bracers were not only nerfed by a damage drop from 300% to 275% :<br />
- Mage lost 10% crit chance so basically the chance to get a hot streak has been nerfed so.. yeah you got it sherlock.. the chance to get a proc from this legendary has been nerfed..<br />
- This proc requires 4 sec hardcast in a window of 11sec (15sec minus 4 hardcasting sec) do you realize how many times the proc will be wasted in a real raid environnement (i mean no LFR..) with no more iceflow in the mage toolkit ? Simcraft or dummy fight are not the reality.<br />
<br />
Just keep reading and playing, but please stop spreading bullshit when you are totally clueless about what you are talking about. This legendary has been nerfed enough in the previous patches, you are just not understanding it because it has not been clearly written in a patch note in red color.</div></div><hr />

You're honestly not understanding my point of how this legendary is still not on the same tier as our others. It hasn't been nerfed enough actually. Will people pick Sephuz? Or will they pick the bracers? They're already nerfing middle-lower tier legendaries, so i'm confused as to why the bracers aren't receiving a larger nerf for them to fall back onto the same tier as the others.<br />
<br />
Icefloes is irrelevant to the strength of the legendary. If you're specced into shimmer, then there's basically no change as you can just blink out of shit while casting it and blink back. Please don't tell anyone to &quot;keep reading and playing&quot; when your knowledge of the situation is as bad as you claim mine is.<br />
<br />
pyro bracer if nerfed turns into a dps loss if mages hardcast pyro for the proc, turning it into a worthless stat stick, all legos nerfed no matter how weak still provides dps benefit.<br />
<br />
ice floes gone and shimmer interrupts casting 99% of the time. Secondary stats nerfed in 7.1.5 meaning less crit = less proc, and also less haste, hardcasting pyro will be even more difficult. Do u even mage kid. <br />
<br />
even with pyro bracer not nerfed they whole spec is getting gutted in 7.1.5 anyway and mages are already migrating to arcane n frost spec. You should be complaining about Lady vash'j gloves not on the nerf list.</div></div><hr />

Truly one of my favourite things these days. Everyone with the bracers claims it shouldn't be touched as it will be a DPS loss, and everyone without them begs for them to be on the same tier as the other legendaries.<br />
<br />
I honestly feel as though maybe they should keep it at 300%. But give it like a ~5% chance to proc with an internal 30sec cd or something lmao<br />

Shows how much you know. The whole time crying about nerfing them even more, while you have no idea how these works? Great. People even told you why they are not getting nerfed below 250%, because even with 250% Pyro Dmg it's still just a margain of a DPS upgrade, everything below just turns into a DPS lost.<br />
Removing of Ice Floes still hurts in a normal raiding environment. Yes, you got shimmer, but it's no where as efficient as Ice Floes with it.<br />
You're losing about 10% Crit right now in PTR compared to life, thats a big nerf to the Bracers aswell. <br />
<br />
But in the end, the things that matter and the facts that got stated in more then one occasion doesn't interest you at all, since all you do is shit on every comment, even if you're wrong.<br />
<br />
And it doesn't matter if you have the Bracer or not, why should they nerf something thats a margain of a dps boost, when other classes got a flat 20% dmg increase when using their CD's?</div></div><hr />

They have horrible stats and a mediocre ability.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Cool, well, we suck at game design and made a bunch of horseshit legendaries, we have to make sure people are equally excited no matter which one they get...&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't you mean equally disappointed? Because I see where this is goi....&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Don't interrupt me. We need to make sure everyone is equally excited no matter if they get Prydaz or a 'best-in-slot' legendary. What does that even mean anyways. So here's what I want you to do, nerf the gloves ALMOST to the ground. I'm talking pretend there's a basement, nerf them to the lobby. Keep the horrendous stats, of course. Ok then we're gonna give feral druids an aura to account for this nerf, there's only room for four abilities on this aura though, even though Demon Hunters get 25. Only room for four. Make sure you find their most damaging attack then OMIT that one. Use the rest.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;But, besides Rip, they only have four decent abilities, one of them is Swipe&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Can't have ferals being too viable in high M+, like they are now. Forget swipe, there must be something else we can put on the gloves...&quot;<br />

But a 70% nerf, and nothing to compensate for it? We get a blanket buff in damage for our abilities, but what the Dev's seem to not understand is that the spec feel very slow without the energy &quot;recudtion&quot; on Shadowstrike that the boots give. The spec is not functioning correctly without them, it's slow, clunky and and boring. :(</div></div><hr />

Why the hell does Sephuz exist. Why can't we just have a few performance improving Legendaries, each of them being good.</div></div><hr />

I agree. Some of us are still desperately trying to get our 2nd Legendary and it just isn't happening. (I have the crappy neck). I have been playing since launch and farm anywhere from 4-5 mythics a night. I do LFR, I do caches, and I raid 3 nights a week with my guild. <br />
<br />
I was the last person to get a Legendary. Now, I'm not only still waiting to get a 2nd Legendary, but the rest of my raiding guildies all have 3 or more legendaries to pick from. I play more than all of them too ... <br />
<br />
So sick of this bullshit RNG system. The fact that I am the only person in our raiding guild that doesn't have 2 (and everyone else has 3+), makes me not want to play this fucking game anymore. Seeing a new guy join our guild and get 2 legendaries in less than 20 minutes, makes me want to gouge my fucking eyes out. <br />
<br />
Do away with this bullshit ...</div></div><hr />

I play Fury, it procs on charge. Playing Solo its a blast. Additionally to the insane burst i'll get some extra 25% beststat+ 75% movementspeed for 10secs. and this every 30 secs. World questing and world pvp is pure joy with it. Not to mention its benefits in M+. For raids you can still equip another ring.<br />
<br />
Not thrilled about the effects on world questing, but nice that you're happy about it. Besides many classes still can't proc it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any proc cast with no pyretic, rop, no crit.<br />
<br />
Any proc cast with 5 pyretic, rop, no crit.<br />
<br />
Any proc cast with 5 pyretic, no rop, crit.<br />
<br />
The cast breaks even at no pyretic, rop, crit.<br />
<br />
The reason? Normal rotation in that four seconds that produces 2 pyroblast, uses 2 fire blast and 1 phoenix is more damage uf the pyros crit and about break even with proc/rop/crit if they dont. Why? Our fireblast with full traits essentially crit fireballs on steroids.<br />
<br />
Now, in the lucky chance you get a proc right a combustion and rop come off cooldown, then yes you can do sime amazing damage, but that is rare and rarer still for you to be otherwise unoccupied enough to take advantage before window closes due to mechanics. And that is with ice floes.<br />
<br />
At 275 they are an appropriate boost for what the dev team seem to be after in %increase.<br />
<br />
Need to append that this is comparing under the new rop and comparing no crit proc to no crit rotation, no crit proc to crit rotation, crit proc to no crit rotation and crit oroc to crit rotation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They didn't do anything to improve the bad ones. They are still bad. People will still complain and leave. There's nothing good in having Sephuz, Bel'ovir, Prydaz, Norgannon's Shoes, even Cord of Infinity. Nothing at all, they wasted your farming time, meanwhile others got BiS.<br />
<br />
Wake up Blizz until it's too late.<br />
<br />
You can imagine how I feel with 2 legendaries...first Sephuz and then Prydaz. It's like getting a flavor toy instead of a serious damage increase.</div></div><hr />

Pretty shitty considering it's not even that great compared to other legendaries. <br />
<br />
<br />
Cus they were trying to fix Outlaw damage. Not the legendaries. These bracers are pretty god damn good for Outlaw single target.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">seventysix</div><div class="date">2016-12-15, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice 3 posts. Who's sock are you? You're honestly not understanding my point of how this legendary is still not on the same tier as our others. It hasn't been nerfed enough actually. Will people pick Sephuz? Or will they pick the bracers? They're already nerfing middle-lower tier legendaries, so i'm confused as to why the bracers aren't receiving a larger nerf for them to fall back onto the same tier as the others.<br />
<br />
Icefloes is irrelevant to the strength of the legendary. If you're specced into shimmer, then there's basically no change as you can just blink out of shit while casting it and blink back. Please don't tell anyone to &quot;keep reading and playing&quot; when your knowledge of the situation is as bad as you claim mine is.<br />
<br />
Do you have, like...legitimate mental issues?<br />
<br />
The bracers are a DPS loss if nerfed below 250%.<br />
<br />
Meaning we would not use the proc, as it would net us less DPS..so how does that make it a god tier legendary item?<br />
<br />
There is no if ands or buts...this is just factual, you may be right that 300% was a bit much which is why they buffed them to 275% clearly they are smarter than you and the false babble you're spewing about in this thread.<br />
<br />
PS. I don't have the bracers and PSS. You're the only person in this thread that actually seems to be &quot;triggered.&quot; or &quot;salty.&quot; &quot;or insert your grammatically incorrect meme word here.&quot;&lt;3&lt;3 ;)</div></div><hr />

Blizz finally officially acknowledges that many legendaries are way to powerful, and therefor people feeling disapointment when finding a &quot;bad&quot; one. and THESE changes are the approch they are going for? What on earth is going on (yes I do take PTR changes with a grain of salt). <br />
<br />
Fuck this game seriously... Do they not understand that people are angry about PAYING 45 euro + 3 months sub fee, and every time they hint that changes/fixes are comming, we get this bullshit? Honestly they game would have been better off without any of these fucking legendaries. <br />

<br />
Now the devs nerf the legendaries that are considered to be much better than the other to even the gap between bad and good ones which is an awesome change, and people still whine. <br />
<br />
They've even stated they will tune the classes after the nerfs to the legendaries to ensure that specs come out net-neutral or close to. Stop fucking whining<br />

But that's where you're wrong man, i'm neither of those things. I'm having a jolly old time talking with people like you. Makes me feel much better about myself tbh getting salty replies for wanting a clearly overpowered item to be on the same level as lets say; Prydaz<br />
<br />
As I've stated before, that you're obviously still unable to comprehend; I think all legendaries should be the same sort of level. They shouldn't give such huge bonuses and since the already garbage ones are being nerfed into oblivion, I don't see why the FM bracers should be excluded from that. I honestly think it should stay at 300% but the proc rate should be reduced drastically<br />
<br />
This is the first time i've seen you say that in this entire thread. Your other posts say verbatim &quot;I think it should be nerfed lower than 250% which makes no sense, I'm going to just reply that I think your counter proposal of a lower proc rate is well thought and actually makes sense. Bravo.</div></div><hr />

It's only true if you're trying to be competitive with everyone in the entire world.<br />

In respect to your own raid that's not as clear-cut as you would think.</div></div><hr />
