Blue Tweets<br />
Chronicle shows us that demons always rez in the Nether. Now it shows Antorus to be the source? Ret-con or explained in game? <br />
I assume you're referring to Turalyon's dialogue? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/890413121763819520))<br />
That is where most people get to and then become confused. So I would say yes that dialogue is a point to clarify.<br />
Feel free to speculate :) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/890417060106219520))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What do you think about progression systems in online games with realistically achievable end point? Should there be a point when the progression ends with a “sense of accomplishment”?<br />
If the endpoint is too easily achievable, that gives players an opportunity to take a break from the game. That can be a good thing if they come back to your game refreshed, but it can be a bad thing if they take a long or permanent break because they’ve run out of content.<br />
<br />
Now, I totally agree that a sense of a accomplishment is important. As gamers, we enjoy filling in bars, but if that bar is filling in really slowly, and if that bar is really long, we may just recognize the futility of our effort and give it up. Progress is important. The best game do this by having multiple bars so that just as you finish one accomplishment, there is something slightly different that is also nearing completion. Consider Civilization. You might be finishing a battle in one part of the map, and then spend a couple of turns finishing an important tech, and then discover you are about to found a new city, and so on. The loop wouldn’t be as compelling if you were only progressing along one axis at a time and saw how far you had to go to get that sense of completion.<br />
<br />
Also, this is really important: the kicker here is that “realistically achievable” isn’t a single number. If you play two hours a month and I play four hours a day, then what is achievable for you may be trivial for me. This is very common.

Or they could try doing what he's hinting Blizzard wants them to do, which is speculate and figure out how this new information fits in with what Chronicles has already shown us. My personal theory is while demons can rez in the Nether, the power of Argus drastically accelerates the process, so the Legion can keep sending army after army at their enemies and keep up the &quot;endless armies&quot; boast that they enjoy so much. They're not endless, they've just used a cheat code so they have little to no rez timer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except, can you point to the place in the Chronicles where it says the resurrection of demons is tied to the world soul inside Argus? That's what people are hung up on, in Chronicles, demonic resurrection was a naturally occurring thing, from before Sargeras even existed. Now it was suddenly created by Sargeras, and tied to a World Soul that he found AFTER he freed the demons that he had to imprison because he couldn't kill them in our reality?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Demons have always been able to come back to life in the twisting nether, but it takes a long time, even more so for the more powerful demons. Sargeras found a way to significantly speed it up by using the world soul of Argus.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I'm scratching my head on that one, too. It will probably be tuned at current gear levels, so why such low gear? I guess there's always M+.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My best guess is they don't want this to become a &quot;go-to&quot; 5-man. I'm assuming they'll do what they did in 7.2 and retune rewards from all 5 man's again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Turalyon says is that the demons respawn unnaturally fast. Essentially Sargeras is using up Argus to speed up the process. I assume that before he did that, demons would respawn slowly, perhaps at a pace similar to the Ancients who took millenia to reconstitute themselves unless there was direct intervention (for instance we see that the Legion is using up souls to speed up Kruul's resurrection even more). For Sargeras and Aggramar fighting across the cosmos, even that slow pace was a problem and forced the creation of Mardum because traveling across worlds took forever.<br />
With the Legion's destruction in 7.3, the demons will still be a problem to the world (though a much smaller issue than the Void) and since there will be no Sargeras to fight them, it would make sense for mortals with world travelling capacity to travel around defeating demons (that for instance would be a solid purpose for the Illidari; continue on the work that Sargeras and Aggramar once did for the Pantheon, and fight demons across the cosmos wherever they arise). Or alternatively mortals could try to create something like Mardum; it's not much unlike the elemental planes that Ra and Helya made.</div></div><hr />

adding a dungeon every patch that most people wont even touch cause it has nothing of use or might only do once or twice for a quest doesn't really qualify as content. The game will slowly die if all they can do is add content that lasts a week</div></div><hr />

To be perfectly honest this is said every beta and every ptr cycle and 9/10 times nothing changes. So given Blizzard's track record it's fairly safe to say these are the ilvls that will go live.</div></div><hr />

This. Tired of the &quot;it's just PTR/beta!&quot; argument. Maybe not 9/10 of the time with betas, but betas and PTR data usually remains the same, aside from small fudges to some class numbers, if that.</div></div><hr />

I speculate more plot holes and poor writing. I'm curious as to how much story Metzen left for them. I have the feeling he helped a lot with Chronicle before leaving, but if they're writing their own stuff now, I wouldn't be surprised to see conflicts with Chronicles already.</div></div><hr />

7.2 releases. 2 dungeons instead of 1. Loot is what it is today.<br />
7.2.5 all dungeon loot item levels raised to 7.2 dungeon ilev.<br />
7.3 2-3 dungeons released. Say item level 880 normal, 905 heroic, 920 mythic <br />
7.3.5 all dungeons brought up.<br />
<br />
Yes this requires releasing more dungeons so its more of a tier. Reuse the same art assets like past expansions. No one would be mad. Use raid assets, world assets idc. Make more dungeons. Icc 5 mans and DS 5 mans were awesome for a scrub like me.</div></div><hr />

hahaha funny thing we've been saying it for years and it's been slowly dying for years just as we said. You are ignorant af to think we are saying these things because we want our beloved game to die so we can say &quot;told you so&quot;, sad you think that. We want changes, we want the same effort put into the game that was put into it 7 years ago. You are wrong, in comparison to previous expansions, the amount of work and content isn't even comparable(except wod). MAYBE on initial release but these patches have been insanely weak with unsustainable weekly gated content that gives no motiviation to want to log in. Maybe they put in the same amount of work and have half the staff? idk but the content is not sustainable. You enjoy yourself and you feel you have plenty of content for yourself and that is fine but you can't just dismiss my concerns and the concerns of a massive portion of loyal players just because YOU are satisfied. YOU need to get in line. There's a reason millions have quit playing and it's not &quot;because we grew up&quot;. I grew up and I would still LOVE to play but the game is boring as all hell.</div></div><hr />
