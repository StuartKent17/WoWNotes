How bad are sub numbers? You give even a second of time to care about someone ruining your game? What the fuck is wrong with you? <br />
<br />
That, and they plan on pruning more abilities? <br />
<br />
That's all I got, from that stream of blather and non-answers and saying no. It used to be, if the devs did Q&amp;A, you'd learn something. What was accomplished here? Anything? What an absolute waste of time. Half the time, I wasn't even sure he was talking about WoW. How did this guy get hired? No passion, no creativity, no clue how his customers use the game, just excuses, more excuses, and bad ideas. Who's cousin or uncle of his works at Blizzard? He has a dream job, and when he talks about it, it's like he's talking about stocking the shelves at a Walmart. <br />
<br />
And, he's dead wrong on splitting PvP from PvE. You can't balance PVP when classes are being balanced against raids. Period. It's time to stop wasting people's time, and do it. And if he won't do it, get rid of him and get someone who will. They've been fucking around with resilience and pvp power and gear for too long - it doesn't fucking work, it's two completely different games, and you can't make a one-size-fits-all class for both. <br />
<br />
I'd love to know what this guy does all day - because it's certainly not listening to his fucking customers.</div></div><hr />

WTF? Seriously?!? They don't even want to balance it, it's mind-boggling. I remember how it used to be, not the abomination it has become. And now, they don't even give a damn about it anymore.<br />

1980 is calling, they want Lore's perm back. I'll admit, I have trouble taking him seriously, ever since the first time I saw it. He's just a PR flack, tho, so it doesn't matter.<br />

Personally I think the ability prune was the worse thing that came about in WOD, it was uneven and sucked the fun out of some of the classes completely.<br />
*on the plus side if this is their future plan it may save me the trouble of thinking about subbing again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey, don't you publicly shame botters! They're customers, too!<br />
<br />
I'm still blown away they said that. My jaw was on the floor. Why would give a flying fuck about a botter? They're cheating! <br />
<br />
Hell, I guess I'll go buy one of those nifty bots and bot my heart out, since Lore says they have feelings, too, and they're customers with the same rights as players who don't cheat. I just won't get caught, like they advised me.<br />
<br />
I'm glad I never bought stock, because if I had, I'd be dumping it right now. Unbelievable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sigh. The same answer that hasn't worked for more than 8 years now. Everyone knows that they need to completely separate the PvE and PvP skills. This has been proven time and time again. Even from a purely optics standpoint, of course they need to separate them to avoid the accusations of impacts of PvP / PvE changes on the PvE / PvP game.<br />

How about making PvP about player versus player not killing ~~200 Raid Bosses? (Serious estimated Number required to get the next step after ~~50 first part and ~~90 second part).<br />
<br />
One rogue could just tag everyone who is doing let's say world boss to PvP combat and it nerfs entire raid. That would be really unbalanced.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this, it's something I have been saying for years now. Hell it is something that is done in RIFT, and I am pretty sure a few other MMO's to boot. It would make balancing on their end a hell of a lot easier as well. Sure it would take a good while to design, but at this point who cares? It's end results would be well worth it.</div></div><hr />

no they just need to remove organized pvp from the game altogether. if player want to attack other players out in the world fine. they need to use pve gear though and if some pve ability seems broken when attacking the other faction fine leave it alone. just make all npc's unattackable and make faction guards unkillable and able to 1-shot opposing players so nobody can grief in cities (on pve realms)</div></div><hr />

Do you work for Blizzard? Because that's their usual approach to a problem - get rid of it, instead of fixing it, lol. <br />
<br />
PvP is part of the game, they're not getting rid of it - they're an esport now, they're too invested. The sad thing is Holinka is in charge of it, which to me says it's going to get a lot worse, before it ever gets better.</div></div><hr />

Which translate into they are as aware as the playerbase that it would be the best improvement of all possible improvements that could be made BUT it would cost them too much effort (revenu loss) to spend that substancial amount of work so they rather stick to their poorly disguised lie that &quot;we dont feel it is the correct solution&quot;.<br />

<br />
They know botters do not make the game look good.<br />
They put a lot of effort into stopping them.<br />
They are not transparent for a few reason. One key reason is they do not want to tip botters off. If they come up with a new method, they don’t want to inform botters of this while they are working on the system.<br />
<br />
And yet the last wave of bot bans were not permabans. Must not be that big a deal to you.</div></div><hr />

I was quite shocked to read this too, i main a warrior and hate the overdependence on RNG of fury (And plain ol' hate tanking), so i'm stuck with Arms, which while bereft of most of its procs is still fun, but if more is removed, there will be nothing left!<br />
<br />
Fun in a game starts with the character you play, if there's no fun in your spec, how can there be fun in raids, questing or PvP?<br />
<br />
Blizz really need to consider where they want to take the game, i doubt it will be much fun if everybody just has 1 &quot;Attack&quot;-button (Or &quot;Spell&quot; for casters, variety!), slight exaggeration, but we're slowly heading there...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
And given the things they've done in the past to get old players back (SoR, 90 boost, catch up mechanisms) Blizzard do care about former players.<br />
<br />
If you look at current numbers (whatever they are) and then look at total number of players ever, I bet the difference is massive. So much potential cash to be made from former players. They'd know from the time they spend perusing sites like MMO and Blizzard Watch that a huge amount of people on those sites are former subscribers just waiting to pick the game up again when the game has something to offer again.</div></div><hr />

That's a straw man, and ignores my question to plaits.<br />
<br />
Perhaps I was too subtle in my post. Why is the $15/month of a man baby that isn't paying them anything worth more than an active subscriber? Why should they ignore the 10 million (or whatever it's dropped to) who are currently paying for a subscription to cater to only a dozen people on MMO that don't pay them anything but bitch and whine about everything for a game they don't even play?<br />
<br />
How much is the entire MMO-Champion's posters worth? Assuming they could even get them all to play (Look at the amount of vitriol in any LFR themed thread or PvE vs PvP thread). 10,000 active players? 100,000? 1,000,000 players?<br />
<br />
What do you want them to do? Kill LFR? Kill casual epics? Kill PvP? Get rid of gnomes? Get rid of the Horde faction?<br />
<br />
Will you personally help pay the active subscription of every player that quits over the changes you want Blizzard to make so you can happily play the game?<br />
<br />
Somehow, I don't think so. <br />
<br />
Do you know why Blizzard is the company responsible for the most successful MMO in history? And continues to be?<br />
<br />
Because they, like many business, cater to the masses. If the majority of their players want a daily quest hub in 6.2 instead of an update to Ashran... guess which one they prioritize. If a Twitter integration costs them very little man power, and means that, say, a million people (10% of their active players) will be tweeting screenshots of how fun and popular WoW is and attracting new players... guess what they integrate.<br />
<br />
At some point decisions were made. The hundreds, or even thousands of players that 'may' quit over the 6.1 Twitter feature (We got THIS instead of real content!) was less than the number of players that were happy with the integration or the potential new players that will be attracted through the feature.<br />
<br />
And unless those hundreds or thousands of those 'diehard fans' are willing to pay a hell of a lot more per month so that they get their content instead of Twitter... why should Blizzard choose them over their other players?<br />
<br />
So again, I ask, why is my active subscription worth less than some random poster here on MMO-C who isn't paying Blizzard a dime? Why should Blizzard be willing to lose me (and other dirty, filthy, casuals) to attract a single person from MMO-C that has already given up on Blizzard?</div></div><hr />

Why does one have to be worth more than the other? And why does it matter to you? Does your game experience change if they're more interested in gaining old customers back? Or new ones? What's the real issue here? New customers and old ones returning is 100% good for every player in the game, because it's more money for development. Or, do you get some kind of weird self worth from thinking they care more about you, than a potential customer?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue that some people seem difficult to grasp is that you do not speak for the 'old players'. You speak for yourself. You might want attunements to be back. Or you might not. Whatever you want, some old players will agree with you. Some will not. Many more active players may agree with you. Many more will not.<br />
<br />
The point is, Blizzard is trying to attract the most players they can. New and old alike. Look at any WoW related thread on MMO-C and you'll see disagreements. Humans are OP in PvP (or not). LFR should be removed (or not). They should cater to the elitists, they should cater to the casuals, they should cater to the PvE players, they should cater to the PvP players.<br />
<br />
And so on.<br />
<br />
The only people will agree on is that WoW is 'broken'. Blizzard needs to care, Blizzard needs to fix the game. The game is dying unless Blizzard does what I want. I know how to fix the game.<br />
<br />
Please.<br />
<br />
Go on, tell us all how Blizzard will make more money by listening to your ideas. I'm sure that if Blizzard does what you want and doesn't listen to Gadzooks, the game will be much better and millions new and old alike will flock to the Bliz store waving their credit cards around.<br />

<br />
What I was trying to say is that neither are worth more than the other. I quit during Wrath because I didn't like Wrath- yet it's the community's favorite expansion. My subscription was not worth the many more players that did love Wrath.<br />
<br />
Yet, nearly everyone in these threads, speak as if they know exactly what everyone else wants. <br />
<br />
They don't. They think they know what they want, and fail to consider that they are the minority. Blizzard has, does, and will continue to cater to the majority to attract the most players. If copying Candy Crush, micro transactions and all, in Garrison 2.0 for WoW 7.0 means higher subs and more happy players, they'll do it, no matter how much the minority might kick, scream, and throw tantrums.<br />
<br />
That's just good business sense.<br />
<br />
Should they try to attract old players? Absolutely. <br />
<br />
Should they do it at the expense of the majority? Absolutely not.<br />
<br />
For example, there are many, many should kill LFR. Remove it tomorrow, even. There are many posts on this site that claim that they'll return if Bliz would axe LFR and stop catering to the casuals. No more welfare epics, no more hand holding. Make it old school (Like Wrath- you know, where Naxx was recycled and horribly undertuned, heroic 5mans were easier than current WoD normals, yet dropped epic gear, and you could grind the 5mans for tier gear...but I digress)<br />
<br />
Should Bliz do that? Axe LFR? I mean, that's what old players who quit want.<br />
<br />
You and plaits seem to think so. <br />
<br />
Another common complaint is that LFG should go away. It destroyed server communities and allowed the community to be as toxic as they like with no consequences (It did in my opinion by the way). Should they kill LFG?<br />
<br />
Keep in mind you'll note that Blizz says in the interview that they tried restricting Ashran to server communities and that blew up in their faces. One sided, unbalanced, horrible queue times are all attributed to the fact that Ashran isn't crossrealm.<br />
<br />
So what I'm pointing out is that while you will see endless posts of &quot;Blizz doesn't care about their players. We're unhappy and yet the Devs say they're happy.&quot;<br />
<br />
Almost none of those posts can agree on what they collectively want, let alone what they want individually (Again, you'll find people saying one thing while complaining about that very thing). It's not that Bliz doesn't care about players- they just don't care about you personally. You do not speak for the whole player base. No one does.<br />
<br />
And Blizz will not, nor should they, cater to a significant minority at the expense of the majority.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">plaits</div><div class="date">2015-04-16, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What I really think Blizzard's problem is worrying about what anybody but themselves think about the game. It's where they've been going wrong since about Cata. <br />
They should stop listening to everyone. Ex-players, new players, players who have played since day one. Doesn't matter. <br />
The only people they should be trying to satisfy is themselves. That they've been chasing their tails trying to make everyone happy is what IS wrong with the game.<br />
<br />
I think they all need to get off twitter, stop trying to &quot;engage with the community&quot;, start ignoring the forums, and just make the damn game.<br />
<br />
They need to stop thinking like any old customer service company, and start thinking more like entertainers (e.g. film makers, musicians, artists). The best bands and artists always make art for themselves first, they don't stop and worry at every thing they do how it will be received. <br />
<br />
[And I don't think current players have any particular higher importance than ex-players, given the difference between me and someone currently subbed is just a couple of clicks. I am literally at any time just a couple of clicks away from being a current subscriber, but it's weird you think I think you're a &quot;filthy dirty casual&quot;, when the fact is I was never a serious raider and the main thing I miss is dailies]</div></div><hr />

How bad are sub numbers? You give even a second of time to care about someone ruining your game? What the fuck is wrong with you? <br />
<br />
That, and they plan on pruning more abilities? <br />
<br />
That's all I got, from that stream of blather and non-answers and saying no. It used to be, if the devs did Q&amp;A, you'd learn something. What was accomplished here? Anything? What an absolute waste of time. Half the time, I wasn't even sure he was talking about WoW. How did this guy get hired? No passion, no creativity, no clue how his customers use the game, just excuses, more excuses, and bad ideas. Who's cousin or uncle of his works at Blizzard? He has a dream job, and when he talks about it, it's like he's talking about stocking the shelves at a Walmart. <br />
<br />
And, he's dead wrong on splitting PvP from PvE. You can't balance PVP when classes are being balanced against raids. Period. It's time to stop wasting people's time, and do it. And if he won't do it, get rid of him and get someone who will. They've been fucking around with resilience and pvp power and gear for too long - it doesn't fucking work, it's two completely different games, and you can't make a one-size-fits-all class for both. <br />
<br />
I'd love to know what this guy does all day - because it's certainly not listening to his fucking customers.<br />
<br />
Try to understand what you hear. Jesus these forums make it so apparent why certain people like the wow devs should be earning 6 figures and certain people like you shouldn't.<br />
<br />
Him saying &quot;bots are customers too&quot; was about trying not to crucify botters. He also added that they were trying to deal with botters also. He never said &quot;oh, botters are customers too so we will not do anything about bots! we love them!&quot; which is what you are trying to make it sound like.</div></div><hr />

Nonsense, you're making excuses for him, and them as a company. He was hired for his so-called expertise at PvP DESIGN, and when he fails to show any competency at it, in his actual work, and then players are confused as to how to fix it, that's on him.<br />
<br />
I'm tired of being told how to take their comments, and what to read into what they say. The guy is a dullard, he has no passion, no vision, no creativity - and every single time someone makes a constructive remark on how to make the game fun, his answer every time is &quot;We disagree&quot;. Not &quot;Hey, that's an idea, we could think about that, could be fun&quot;, or &quot;No, we tried that and it doesnt work - here's why&quot;, or simply take the time to explain why what they're doing works for them. It's just &quot;Here, take this, shut up.&quot; <br />
<br />
What I got from the hour of my life he wasted is that he's not someone I'm confident that can lead the PvP game forward into the future where it's fun, compelling, and worth a $15 sub. What I got from him is excuses, rationalizations, and &quot;No, we disagree&quot;. I don't have any faith that he's capable of FUN. This is, after all, a game. It's not rocket science, it's not saving lives, its not reducing carbon in the atmosphere, or feeding starving people, it's a game, i's optional entertainment that should be fun, not a grim numbers grind thrown together by a knob who wouldn't know fun if it bit him on the ass. I want devs who have fun, with their game and with their customers, not some dolt who only knows how to say no and REFUSES to discuss why he thinks the game he designed is fun. That's why i liked GC, at least he sounded like he had fun in the game - I've never once heard Holinka talk about the game in terms of having fun, or use examples that show he has fun playing, like over devs have done. <br />
<br />
But nooooooo, it's OUR fault. Screw that noise. I play to play a game, not design it for them. If he's worthy of the job title he has, then the game should reflect that - and it doesn't.</div></div><hr />

But that was under Ghostcrawler, still. And Ghostcrawler was definitely more visionary than what currently crawls around at Blizz HQ.<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler said things that, somewhat, make sense. &quot;We want to balance PvP around 3v3&quot;. And that was perfectly fine and, to some extend, worked out perfectly fine. Holinka however never says these things. He either says &quot;Oh we're happy. Yeah... yeah...&quot; or &quot;We'll look at X&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it constantly boils down to, PvE players hate PvP balancing affect their PvE, and PvP players hate how PvE affect their PvP.</div></div><hr />

Separated. Pvp and pve. It has been universally what the playerbase has wanted, and it just boils down to them not wanting to allocate the resources to do it and get it over worth.</div></div><hr />

Why should Blizzard carter to you. Why is your potential $15/month worth more than the $15/month I am actively paying right now?<br />
<br />
It's not.<br />
<br />
Find a different game.<br />

Holy crap God almighty this has to be the dumbest comment I've ever read on any forum at any time. I'm guessing you either don't work or work at McDonald's because you have zero business sense and quite frankly judging by this post a very low IQ.<br />
<br />
Wow, just wow.<br />
<br />
Since you obviously drastically need help I'm going to help you. You see, in the big boy business world where people wear their big boy pants. The number one goal and focus of any modern business today is growth! Without growth, businesses don't survive; businesses can't maintain they need growth. <br />
<br />
Growth is king <br />
growth is beauty <br />
growth is life. <br />
<br />
You obtain growth by catering to potential customers just as well as you cater to your current customer base. The goal there is a fine balance but potential customers are extremely important for growth.</div></div><hr />

Keep your patronizing tone and your oversimplified view of reality to yourself, will you? You're not impressing anyone here.</div></div><hr />

So melee classes needs interrupt so they can have some kind of 'advantage' to spell casters and the spell casters' advantage is that they attack from distance?<br />
So almost every melee class have ability to get to You very quickly; Warrior have charge x2 and heroic leap, Monk have Roll x2 and Flying Serpent Kick and so on, they already have slows/dazes, and they NEED so much interrupts? They have stuns and other shit to stop You from casting anyway, plus Stun is better than Fear 'casue You can still damage person, while single attack can break victim from fear.<br />
The only caster is good in PvP atm is Boomkin and maybe Mage, what about Shaman? Warlock? Priest?<br />
<br />
And yea pruing classes is the thing that we need at this moment, almost every spec is like from 3 to 5 button class ;)</div></div><hr />

1. Rogues can just sap me and steal my quest coins. <br />

3. There was no guidance on how to play the whole place. Ashran is a giant &quot;how the F does this work?&quot; island. Example: numbers at the top of the screen that really don't inform me of anything. Horde 1025 alliance 78. /shrug. Am i supposed to guess or just ignore it?<br />

Jesus these forums make it so apparent why certain people like the wow devs should be earning 6 figures and certain people like you shouldn't.<br />
<br />
Him saying &quot;bots are customers too&quot; was about trying not to crucify botters. He also added that they were trying to deal with botters also. He never said &quot;oh, botters are customers too so we will not do anything about bots! we love them!&quot; which is what you are trying to make it sound like.<br />
<br />
Earning 6 figures is both a blessing and a curse in disguise, when that magical number 45k or something along those lines you approach in pay your expect to sacrifice more of your time to work and spend less leisure time, sure it's great in the long run but you do lose alot of yourself along the way.<br />
<br />
They probably have a 3 strikes method against botters as it's against the &quot;Terms of Use&quot; and automotive play is one of them, this is not the same thing as &quot;Terms of Service&quot; which people get mixed up and accused Method of cheating which they did not, &quot;Terms of Service&quot; is not &quot;Terms of Use&quot;. &quot;Terms of Service&quot; is what blizzard can do when your account is compromised and what they can do to help you in assistance and recovery, that's how come they don't ban gold buyers but can't help them as much as people who genuinely earned their gold.<br />

If you put effort into Ashran it was blast back then. When you discovered you earn conquest points from doing an event you went &quot;cor blimey&quot; lets get a raid group together and start doing events which happen frequently and having small skrimishes and dominating the area which you have to have a controlling presence on the field with your raid and helping each other out.<br />
<br />
Then they started nerfing events, and main road and a month later.... <br />
<br />
Now it's just well we might as well twiddle our thumbs for the next hour or so for the next event cycle to happen.</div></div><hr />
