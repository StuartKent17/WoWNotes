Goblin Cinematic - Escape from Kezan<br />
The ending cinematic of the Goblin starting zone is now available on beta, obviously it's a huge spoiler and it will be better to see it in-game but hey, it's awesome. <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;object width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;465&quot;&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;movie&quot; value=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/RGrHuYSmPIA?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;hd=1&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowFullScreen&quot; value=&quot;true&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;param name=&quot;allowscriptaccess&quot; value=&quot;always&quot;&gt;&lt;/param&gt;&lt;embed src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/v/RGrHuYSmPIA?fs=1&amp;amp;hl=en_US&amp;amp;hd=1&quot; type=&quot;application/x-shockwave-flash&quot; allowscriptaccess=&quot;always&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;true&quot; width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;465&quot;&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;<br />
<br />
On a sidenote, the only reason why this cinematic wasn't datamined earlier is because the files aren't readable in the MPQs, the current theory is that they're heavily encrypted and probably only unlockable through the server. I guess you won't see the Cataclysm cinematic before it hits the live servers, except if there are very crazy hackers who love WoW out there. <br />

Build 13117 Models - Spectral Steed/Wolf Mounts and Dark Phoenix/Sunflower Pets<br />
The latest beta build added a couple of interesting models. The Reins of the Spectral Steed (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/64998/reins-of-the-spectral-steed/) and Reins of the Spectral Wolf (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/64999/reins-of-the-spectral-wolf/) from the Tol Barad quartermasters finally have their own models. Also, the model of the Dark Phoenix Hatchling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/63138/dark-phoenix-hatchling/) (Reward from United Nations (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5125/united-nations/)) has been updated to a nicer version in this build and Brazie's Sunflower (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/93823/brazies-sunflower/) got a ridiculously awesome unique model. (Quest reward from the Peacebloom vs Ghouls questline (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1979-Tier-11-Mini-Preview-Ghouls-vs-Peacebloom-Blue-Posts))<br />

Patch 4.0.1 Release Date &quot;Gone&quot;<br />
Bad news everyone! The release date for Patch 4.0.1 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1993-Patch-4.0.1-release-date-Heroic-Deadmines-Blue-Posts) is gone from the Streaming Trial Download page and it no longer displays October 5th or October 12th.<br />

<br />
Good news everyone! The latest Cataclysm build changed the version of the game to 4.0.3 instead of 4.0.1, it means that Blizzard is most likely done with PTR builds. Blizzard probably decided to hide the dates just in case something bad happens but I think you can still expect 4.0.1 on live servers very soon, especially with all the recent announcements about it. <br />

Faces of Cataclysm Update: Cho'gall<br />
Cho'gall<br />
Cho'gall's sordid history is a testament to his unflinching desire to sow chaos wherever his dark influence extends. The first of the ogre magi, Cho'gall rose to prominence in the old Horde as chieftain of the orcish Twilight's Hammer clan. His dubious loyalties became apparent when he abandoned the Horde during a pivotal moment in the Second War. In retaliation, forces dispatched by Orgrim Doomhammer slaughtered most of Cho'gall's traitorous clan, forcing him and his surviving cohorts into hiding. Over the following years, the ogre mage molded the Twilight's Hammer into a fanatical cult devoted to worshipping the Old Gods -- ancient harbingers of the apocalypse. Cho'gall's obsession with these malefic deities led him to the ruined city of Ahn'Qiraj, where he began efforts to awaken an Old God by harnessing the immense powers of Med'an, the new Guardian of Tirisfal. Ultimately, Med'an thwarted Cho'gall's plans, and the scheming ogre mage was thought slain. The Twilight's Hammer, however, has remained organized, leading to fears that Cho'gall is still alive... and merely biding his time, waiting for the right moment to make his presence known once again.<br />

Cataclysm Beta - Guild Wipe &amp; Experience Boost<br />
We are in the process restarting the beta realms to wipe all guilds. There are a number of lingering bugs that can only be fixed by a full wipe. We also want to take this opportunity to see guilds go from level 1 to 25 with a fresh start now that we have everything implemented.<br />
<br />
We have also boosted the experience and rep gain for guilds by x5 the normal amount. The daily and weekly caps have also been raised to correspond with this. We are doing this to allow us to get more testing on as many things as we can before ship. Please remember that this increase is ONLY for beta and we will be going back to the normal values when Cataclysm ships.<br />
<br />
All of the feedback, reports and bugs that you guys have been posting in this forum have been extremely useful. Please keep the posts and feedback coming! <br />

New Profession in Cataclysm: Archaeology<br />
Blizzard released their own preview of Archaeology, you won't find a lot of exciting details but just like any official preview it's always a good read. More details available on the preview I posted a few day ago. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Archaeology Preview and Rewards (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1968-Archaeology-Rewards-and-Previews-Blue-Posts)<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunting the unknown, discovering the lost, knowing the forgotten. The Explorers' League of Ironforge is redoubling its efforts to learn the secrets of the past. The league has begun teaching the discipline of archaeology to all members of the Alliance in a bold attempt to procure as many ancient relics as possible. This initiative is being matched by the campaign of the Reliquary -- a Horde faction formed from an unknown council based in Silvermoon. The Reliquary is training members of the Horde in the art of the dig and challenging them to find any and all artifacts of historical significance before the Explorers' League does. Each side now jockeys for position, relishing in the chase, vying for control of time-lost relics, and jealously guarding any valuable information the objects may impart.<br />
<br />
Archaeology is a new secondary profession introduced in Cataclysm that can be trained along with Cooking, First Aid, and Fishing. After learning Archaeology from the appropriate trainer in a major city, the newly educated treasure hunter will be presented with an Archaeology Journal to track his or her progress, as well as a surveying tool to facilitate discoveries.<br />
<br />
The main purpose of Archaeology, of course, is to find artifacts! Artifacts are items lost to history that carry with them a story of the past. While their worth is mainly obtained from the information they impart and the simple joy of discovering them, rarer artifacts represent treasures of sizeable value. Every artifact has an origin, and these origins can be traced back to the races that now inhabit Azeroth and Outland. Research projects are presented in the Archaeology Journal, categorized by the races they're associated with. The fragments needed to complete each research project can be discovered by visiting dig sites.<br />
<br />
At any time, players can open their maps and see these dig sites outlined for them across Azeroth and Outland. Upon reaching a dig site, a player can then search for artifact fragments with the survey tool. The survey tool arms the Archaeologist with two unique devices: a telescope and a distance indicator. The distance indicator will change from red to yellow to green as the treasure hunter gets closer, while the telescope will keep pointing the player in the right direction. When the player locates and digs up the treasure, it will provide the Archaeologist with fragments that are collected in the journal. This process will eventually result in a complete artifact.<br />
<br />
Completing the rarer artifacts can reward the Archaeologist with unique items, including epic-quality weapons, mounts, and non-combat pets. In addition to the normal artifact fragments used to finish all research projects, special fragments called keystones can also be found by higher-level players. These fragments are valuable to all Archaeologists because they count as five normal fragments for most research projects, and they can be freely sold and traded. Archaeologists of exceptional skill can also use keystones to grant benefits to their friends in high-end raid instances.<br />
<br />
Whether you're an avid treasure hunter with a drive to discover all the world has to offer, someone interested in uncovering the mysteries of the past, or an explorer looking to obtain items of power, Archaeology is your ticket to a glorious adventure.<br />

Blizzcon Tickets Emails<br />

<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
New Raid Lock System<br />
At some point players are going to need to adjust to Cataclysm changing the world, just as you did with the 2.0 and 3.0 patches. We need to release these patches to set everything up for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Could we have planned to release patch 4.0.1 without the new raid system? Technically yes, but patch 4.0.1 is overhauling game systems entirely. The raid system is only one part of all of the systems changes going in. You're going to have to adjust to them at some point so we can release the next expansion with the core systems overhauls in place. It might create an awkward period of time between the release of patch 4.0.1 and the release of the next expansion, but we ask that you embrace it, check out the new features, and let us know what you think. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026395057/keep-25-and-10icc-lockouts-separate/))<br />
<br />
Icecrown and Ruby Sanctum loot tables not updated for the new Raid Lock System<br />
In a perfect world the loot tables would be updated in Icecrown Citadel and Ruby Sanctum. More importantly though, we want players testing out this new feature and becoming more familiar with it. We feel it's a higher priority for raiders to have a chance to get some experience with this system before entering Cataclysm raids, than it is for Wrath raiding progression to be seamless this far into the expansion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026395057/keep-25-and-10icc-lockouts-separate/))<br />
<br />
10/25-Man Raids and new lock system<br />
The design behind the new system is partially to address this issue. 10- and 25-player raids weren't designed with the intent that players would just do a raid twice a week. It's understandable that this became natural player behavior though given the design and loot system, which is why we're changing it for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you'll be running the same raids for the next several months is pure speculation. Ultimately, the distinction between 10- and 25-player shinies is almost completely null and void when factoring in new items in Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026395057/keep-25-and-10icc-lockouts-separate/))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Threat generation<br />
There is no reason for paladins to generate less threat per unit healing than other healers. The original concern was that paladins would tank by healing themselves, but that isn't a realistic concern in Cataclysm and probably has not been for some time.<br />
<br />
A clever player compared the threat modifiers in the live game to a tax law with all of its peculiar exceptions and shelters and special case rules. We consolidated the whole thing to a modifier on Defensive Stance, Bear Form, Righteous Fury and Blood Presence. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026394359/found-this-little-gem-on-the-tanking-forum/))<br />
<br />
Threat - Tanking and threat modifiers boosted to 125%<br />
This is not a warrior nerf and has nothing to do with Vengeance. We buffed the threat done by all four tanks because players were having too many threat issues very early in fights. It's one thing to ask the mage not to Arcane Blast until the tank gets a hit or two on the boss. It's another if the dps are all sitting around for several seconds waiting for the fight to begin.<br />
<br />
When we removed the passive threat reduction from say Battle Stance and rogues and paladin healing, that left tank threat slightly below where it had been. We suspected we would need to bring it up but just didn't have good estimates yet for how high it would need to go up.

Hunter builds balance<br />
At the moment on our internal builds, Survival is slightly higher than MM or BM. Our builds already have the changes you are mentioning. Before those changes, BM was much higher. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026394294/new-hunter-build/))<br />
<br />
[...] Aimed Shot's damage is low and will be improved.<br />
<br />
As you've noticed, Kill Command is proving a tricky ability to balance. It's pure attack power and doesn't scale with weapon damage and is based on pet attack modifiers. That's why the numbers swing often dramatically patch to patch. For what it's worth, we think the numbers are getting close now on our local builds.<br />
<br />
At the moment, Survival actually has the highest dps in raid gear, though the other specs are within 2K or so. It's unlikely we'll juice Survival's damage until we get more empirical data from players. Players sometimes surprise us with gear, rotation or talent choices which lead to different numbers than we predicted. We are going to make Lock and Load reset the Explosive Shot cooldown when it procs.<br />
<br />
We changed pet scaling to make all 3 pet types scale with the same amount of attack power, which should bring the 3 pet types DPS closer together (though Ferocity will still do the most damage, as intended). We want Ferocity to do more damage than Cunning, but not by a huge margin. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702152874/hunter/))<br />

Mana regeneration<br />
We don't want paladins to be constantly mana starved but we also think it's silly if the blue bar is just taking up space on your screen and irrelevant to anything you do. We recently increased the mana given by Judgements of the Wise, and we could bump that again as necessary.<br />
<br />
We want resources to matter for tanks, just less so than for other roles, since tanks have a lot of other things to manage. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026393767/crusader-strike-feels-too-expensive-now/))<br />

Chakra<br />
As a data point, internally we see Chakra Heal used more often in 5-player dungeons and Chakra Renew used more often in raids. There is some subtlety to how Chakra gets used though, so we don't expect it to be one of those &quot;always do X when Y&quot; deals.

Searing Pain/Mind Spike<br />
The design intent of Searing Pain (and Mind Spike) is for these abilities to be used in situations where threat doesn’t matter, such as soloing, PvP, and where different adds spawn that aren’t really affected by threat (such as Snowbolds on ToC as an example, or when players are ensnared in something that has to be broken out of from damage etc.) Or, alternatively, on those rare occasions where a caster tank is optimal.

Soul Swap cooldown<br />
Yeah, we think being able to instantly apply all of your dots with some bonus front load damage with no cooldown wasn't going to be balanceable. Pestilence for DKs is somewhat of a different situation since the diseases are precursors for being able to do real damage rather than being a lot of real damage themselves. You don't normally see the DK using Pestilence and just letting the disease ticks kill everything, which is a play style often associated with locks.(Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27026373670/warlock-soul-swap-cooldown/))<br />

Bane of Agony / Pandemic<br />
We agree that BoA is problematic with Pandemic, and we may end up removing it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702232806/warlock/))<br />
<br />
Shadow Embrace / Haunt<br />
Before Shadow Embrace and Haunt, we really couldn’t tune Affliction DPS to be competitive for fights where there weren’t several adds to DoT up. The intent of Haunt and Shadow Embrace is to increase your single target DPS while not making your multi-DoT damage overpowered. This is the same philosophy behind Grace, and most other limit-one, ramp-up effects. The alternative would be to make UA, BoA etc. limit one. But I’m sure that would not be a popular change. :) We to grapple a little with the perception that these talents are supposed to be an overall dps nerf rather than a single target dps buff. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702232806/warlock/))<br />
<br />
Molten Core<br />
We're considering having Molten Core proc from Immolate and just removing the Soul Fire part of the talent. We want to make sure Demo's dps isn't entirely balanced around the execute phase of a fight. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702232806/warlock/))</div></div><hr />

Don't sound the alarms, but basically the answer is &quot;yes&quot; to all of that. Class and talent changes are coming in 4.0.1, and all of the temporary brokenness they bring is coming with them. There may be a temporary damage modifier in place to keep PvP somewhat sane, but it is unlikely to be well balanced until Cataclysm release.<br />
<br />
Fortunately WoW is only a game, and there are plenty of new toys to play with in the meantime. 6-8 weeks and you can go back to your routine grind of whatever you do.</div></div><hr />

I remember a couple times they called an extended maintenance &quot;normal maintenance&quot; on a patch week. People thought the patch wasn't coming until they start downloading it. Also, PTR servers may still be up when a patch downloads (that is in response to another common myth)<br />
<br />
Since PTR has been sharing builds with Beta, if Beta switched to 4.0.3, PTR cannot receive a new build (unless they start testing 4.0.3, which I doubt). It is possible they will keep PTR up another week without a new build, but if the patch does not come this week, I think the 12th is a certainty.</div></div><hr />

Is it ONLY the new races, race/class combinations and world changes that will NOT be in it? Will class changes like the entire Paladin overhaul, new talent builds etc all be in 4.0.1?<br />
<br />
Does that mean if it comes out next week or the week after that we'll be tanking ICC and other current content with the new changes? Does that mean that from next week or the next week after I will have to learn how to play my class all over again? (Since I'm a Paladin).<br />
<br />
And what I'm most concerned of,... almost every blue posts changes are being made to the classes, balancing and all that. Will the Arena and PVP be completely imbalanced? Will Warrior tanks have shit threat? Just because they're still tinkering with numbers in beta?<br />
<br />
Class and talent changes are in, races and world changes aren't. So yes you'll be tanking ICC, and yes probably some things will be different or even broken. Generally though the way it usually works out is that players get massively more powerful, because they can get talents that are designed for the new level cap at the old cap. Even with the new talent system, that will probably still be the case. <br />
<br />
The arena season will end the moment 4.0.1 goes live so I wouldn't worry about PVP imbalance. When 3.0 hit, the arena servers were so laggy it was unplayable anyway. As for BGs, they said they'd put in temporary damage nerfs inside BGs if it turns out damage is just too ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Also, numbers from the beta won't affect 4.0.1 live servers, just like tinkering on the PTR doesn't affect it now. They won't go live with a build that makes it impossible for anyone to clear ICC for a month.</div></div><hr />

Sure, the Goblin video was nice, but Worgen, being the superior race, will have a superior cinematic. I look forward to it. :cool:</div></div><hr />

And I wish people would stop calling this simple machinima crap &quot;cinematic&quot;<br />

Its NOT machinima, its a cinematic, and I can tell you don't know how HARD it is to make CGI cinematic. You don't know about how long it takes to pose and animate them, or create the realistic models or even RENDER them if you know what that word means.<br />

Blizzard is getting to be more blatantly shameless in their sheer laziness and crapping on their consumer with recycling stuff. That's from the gigantic force of brainwashed people who were rewired to only say, &quot;omg... ______ is AMAZING&quot;. And it's because of these people why we keep getting more recycled content than original content. They'll be the destruction of their very own favorite game in the end.<br />
<br />
The Goblin cinematic was nicely done, though would love to see them blow some of those hundreds of millions in pure profits this game makes to do their CGI stuff which they're good at. It goes to show that when Blizzard is forced to make new content they can do a good job, it's just the fans are not forcing them in the slightest. In fact, they encourage them to recycle, and forgive them from &quot;Copy and Pasting&quot; models.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seriously, it`s not like scenes like these could easily be played in such a fast dramatic pace using standard wow gameplay. And what? these scenes are 5 minutes long each with like at least 100 hours of gameplay to reach level 80(85) then unlimited after that when farming, professions and multiple characters are added on top of that. I don`t often call people out on bitching for nothing but anyone who thinks WoW is getting too much movies should STFU.<br />
<br />
On a different note it`s not surprising that blizzard bitched out on yet another deadline(stated by them or otherwise). Real Cata (not these useless 4.0.1 patches) in 2012 it seems.<br />
<br />
Also the raid changes are shitty, blizzard is lazy so they create half the loot, take away half of the endgame weekly routine, then implement a lockout by boss mechanic that should have been implemented in vanilla WoW.<br />

Blizzard must of paid James Cameron for the Titanic script cause that sinking scene is so similar. the boat rears it's back out of the water, people begging to be released from behind the locked doors and then finally the last scene where you see the ship come down and you see some Goblins in the water thrown from the ship. All we need now is Celine Dion to sing as a Goblin - lmao</div></div><hr />

I did not say mario was a bad game but if you think wow and mario take the same skill level or brain power to play than you are sadly mistaken my friend. There are various ways in which you can compare the two games and notice the difference whereas oranges and apples just come down to a choice of taste which is biased. Furthermore if you read my response again you will notice that I said even mario takes some skill and coordination to play.<br />
<br />
Also at the people claiming, at least from my pov that I and TB are the same, I can tell you that it is not the case. Just like him maybe I got tired of all the &quot;bad players&quot; this game has produced lately,nothing more nothing less. It's people like them who ruin the game for everyone. This is a multi player game where your actions affect people around you. What is worse most of the people these days don't even want to improve or adjust when you point out the obvious errors because they are either to lazy or don't care. <br />
<br />
If trying to make people better gamers so I and others don't have to suffer due to their incompetence makes me an elitist then so be it.</div></div><hr />

Wwll actually oranges and apples can be judged on much more than just taste, the nutrition each provides per portion can be directly compared numerically and seasonal yields per region can be better or worse for each so it's not all bias.<br />
<br />
WoW can be pretty braindead a lot of the time so don't go thinking its leaps and bounds over so many other things just because the occasional boss needs some people to wake up. I'm not claiming that any mario game is a brainbuster but play some of the old ones and I'm sure you'll lose lives more often than you went to the graveyard per hour (not a perfect example but again, not really possible to compare like i said). Mario games have a definitive ends (they don't have the luxury of continuous patches increasing the difficulty over time) where WoW dosn't (top level? final boss atm? max skills? besides being a longer game anyways) so that makes the endgame wrong to compare. Anyways the games are pretty much uncomparible in most fair ways, at least in the same respect you claim apples and oranges can't be compared when it's about enjoyment preference. Because one game is longer than the other dosn't clearly make one better/harder than the other either (not that you made that claim...yet)<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to defend mario or even really trying to argue you out of any sort of spite but don't become high and mighty with you're &quot;there are so many bad gamers out there&quot; stuff and try to make an inept analog while trying to argue someone elses inept statements (BTW I didn't create any new comparisons I was merely disproving yours so don't claim that mine are faulty cause in the end it comes back to you). <br />
<br />
Anyways I also realize/hope you probably didn't really mean to sound the way you did (everyone knows the apples to oranges argument, I'm sure you probably didn't think much of it when you wrote it.) but mario really didn't need to be sucked into this. I'm probably done nitpicking</div></div><hr />

Well as to the orange apple analogy I just took two random fruits to illustrate the idea. As for fruits and the actual games I was providing &quot;feedback&quot; from the point of the potential buyer who cares mostly about quality(taste maybe some nutritional value as well and gameplay). Furthermore i chose mario just because it was an old game that many knew how to play(or at least i think they did) and to contrast mechanics. Like i said I did in no way try to imply mario was a bad game just that it was different at least gameplay wise compared 2 wow. Mario is static wow is progressive, therefor you always need to learn new things.<br />
<br />
As to wow being braindead that is due to all the addons and videos out there. Ask vanilla players how bosses felt without them, although they were way easier than the ones we have today. Every boss is hard till you learn how to beat it.<br />
<br />
Anyways let's just toss all this fruit games analogy out the window no point arguing about it. My point is there are allot of bad players out there who just say things without thinking about what or how the real situation is(he knows better than the entire blizz dev team). Because this is what it all started from some guy talking .... out of his mouth without actually saying anything worth remembering and another one claiming he is discussing the game's future. <br />
<br />
<br />
The new raid lock-out system being tested in ICC and RS is completely stupid. I'll leave it at that.<br />
<br />
<br />
'Total assertion with no evidence or rationale to back it up, I'll leave it at that'. <br />
<br />
Yeah thanks for your dumb opinion I guess.<br />
<br />
<br />
Take your elitist attitude back to your YouTube page, please. We don't need it here - we're too busy discussing the game to tell you how wonderful you are right now, thank you.<br />
<br />
Like I said if these guys are discussing wow's future no wonder it got where it is today. TB called him dumb based on the guy's words,rest just opened their mouths without actually thinking.</div></div><hr />
