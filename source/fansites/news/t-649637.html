Patch 3.2: Call of the Crusade<br />
The upcoming major content patch, Call of the Crusade, will bring a host of new features for World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
The Argent Tournament Expands: With the help of Azeroth's heroes, the Argent Crusade will finish the Argent Coliseum just in time to call for all brave citizens to prepare for battle with the Lich King. New dailies, rewards, and more will be available at the Argent Tournament grounds to lure adventurers into the coliseum.<br />
Crusaders' Coliseum: In order to prepare for a siege on Icecrown Citadel, players will be called by the Argent Crusade to test their mettle in the Coliseum. 5-player, 10-player, and 25-player challenges await inside.<br />
New Battleground: Isle of Conquest, a new large-scale siege Battleground, will be open. The Horde and Alliance will battle head-to-head for control of strategic resources to lay siege to the keeps of their opponents.<br />
New Arena Season: Season 7 will officially start, paving the way for all-new items and challenges. <br />
<br />
A few more details were also revealed in blue posts and Zarhym made an interesting comment about patch 3.3. release date.<br />
Coliseum Raid Instance<br />
Yes, there will be a 5-player version, then a 10/25-player version. The bosses will be different for the two versions. Think Ring of Blood or Amphitheater of Anguish, but more epic. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367596635-blizzard-shop-talk--under-development.html))<br />
<br />
Isle of Conquest Battleground<br />
Wintergrasp combined with Alterac Valley with a few more twists. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367596635-blizzard-shop-talk--under-development.html))<br />
<br />
Patch 3.2 and 3.3 Release date <br />
Do you really think Ulduar achievements will last a year? Instances become stale after 6 months even with achievements. Yea 3.2 won't be till later this year and by then Ulduar will have been played to death and people will want something fun and new to do and not some small joke instance since we won't see Icecrown till April/May next year probably.<br />
Would it help if I told you your presumed time lines are way too inflated? (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367596635-blizzard-shop-talk--under-development.html))<br />

Recent In-Game Fixes - 05/22<br />
05/22/09<br />
A bug with the Blood Draining weapon enchant has been fixed to allow the Blood Reserves to restore the proper amount of health.<br />
Wintergrasp Demolishers should now properly damage all Siege Workshops.<br />
The bonus damage from spell power on the Druid ability Thorns has been reduced by half.<br />
The bonus damage from spell power on the Paladin ability Retribution Aura has been reduced by half. The threat generated by that damage has been doubled per point of damage to keep the threat generation about equal to before.<br />
Ghostcrawler explained the reason behind the changes to Thorns and Retribution Aura.<br />
Both Thorns and Ret Aura scale with spellpower, which is not in abundance on tanks. On the other hand, on level 80 classes with spell power they could hit an attacker for 1000 or more damage per hit of just passive damage that doesn't even requrie a button press. That's pretty generous. <br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
<br />
New zeppelin between Orgrimmar and Thunder Bluff<br />
Simply put, every single city aside from Thunder Bluff is connected by a boat or zeppelin. Thunder Bluff has been unique since the latest expansion in that it still requires a run. No, it is not as difficult a run as the old Menethil jog, but it still requires a lengthy trip through over-level, hostile territory for an individual newly made who wants to make use of the facilities in Thunder Bluff.<br />
<br />
This addition isn't primarily directed at the people who have the flightpath. Yes, you can fly from Orgrimmar to Thunder Bluff still, just as you can fly from Ironforge to Stormwind, but that does not invalidate the tram's existence for those starting a new character or starting the game as a whole. And while you may not think of it in those terms, there are still fresh-faced players, new to World of Warcraft, joining us. <br />
<br />
As the craft leaves from one of the zeppelin towers in Durotar and is slower than the wyvern flight, I don't believe the population of Thunder Bluff will skyrocket significantly. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17345934557-thunderbluff-too-remote.html))<br />
<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
1vs1 PvP Balance<br />
I believe we have offered the justification before, but to reiterate it, we designed WoW to be a group-based game. You participate through much of the content, especially the end-game content, as a team. If we had developed a 1v1 game, we would have made some of the mechanics work very differently. In a 1v1 game for example, healing would have to be far weaker such that a single healer could not overcome a single damage-dealer. (Currently a 5-player dungeon or Arena team needs but one healer for the entire group.) Abilities, particularly the crowd-control, would have to be much less powerful because there would be nobody to help you out. It is likely that class abilities and stats would have to be a lot more homogenized because basically you are compressing all of the roles and strengths of the entire team into one player. That's not to say you don't come into 1v1 scenarios sometimes even when you're participating as a team. But we don't expect those to be as balanced as larger group interactions.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure what the foundation stone of all pvp is to which you refer. Many competitive sports would not be nearly as interesting (nor likely as balanced) in a 1v1 setting. Consider (American) football. Would you put a defensive linesman against a receiver? Does that even make sense? It's designed to be a group sport. WoW is designed for the most part to be a group-based game.<br />
<br />
Compared to a lot of MMOs you can experience a lot of WoW's content while solo, but it should be obvious that we don't offer 1 player Arena team or 1 player raids for a reason. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367806823-blizz-really-just-what-are-you-doing.html))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
is it really that bad to have a &quot;best&quot; profession? (See Jewelcrafting Nerf (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=58038.0))<br />
Yes, we think so. A key to games being fun is feeling like you have a choice. If you aren't making decisions then you aren't really playing a game -- you are watching something as a viewer not participating as a player. Game design has proven over many years that when you have choice A and choice B where choice A grants more power and choice B looks cooler or grants almost any other kind of benefit, a vast majority of players will choose A. In their minds there is no choice. It has to be A. Likewise if humans were the most powerful race and mages were the most powerful class then WoW would not be very diverse. We want tradeskills to be a choice. Having a best profession means that choice does not exist. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17367806823-blizz-really-just-what-are-you-doing.html))<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting Nerf<br />
All of the other professions were more or less in-line with each other but we felt Jewelcrafting with the disabling of meta-gem requirements and the easy ability to hit 3 socket bonuses on top of getting stats from the Dragon's Eye gems put it clearly above every other profession<br />
<br />
While there is a time to buff things, if anytime there was a balance issue and we only buffed things, the numbers would rise at a rapid rate and get out of control. There is a time to buff things, but when we feel one thing is too far ahead, it's time for a nerf, which we know is never popular, but we feel it needs to be done. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367876704-blizzard-why-nerf-things-instead-of-buff.html))<br />
<br />
Itemization<br />
Itemization and stats role<br />
When I say it's a class problem and not an item problem what I mean is that we are relatively locked into how many pieces we can drop. If we drop more pieces, the chance you will get something useful is even less. Therefore we have to make sure the pieces that do drop appeal to a wide variety of specs and classes. When you don't care about a stat that someone you are sharing with very much cares about, that creates a problem that we do not want to fix by just making two different pieces. (Nor do we want to turn even more gear into tokens and badges. That gets lame.)<br />
<br />
A great example of this are regen stats. By regen stats I mean MP5 and Spirit. Yes, you can get regen through other stats, but bear with me for a minute. Our basic design is that dps casters generally don't run the risk of running out of mana, assuming they play reasonably well and aren't in over the head. (i.e. this doesn't mean you can point out cases where you ran OOM and claim the system is broken). But we do want healers to face the risk of running OOM. Healer mana and tanks being gibbed are the two main tools we have for ending encounters (and often even PvP). We need for healers to care about MP5 and Spirit as regen stats, but for casters to largely be able not to. We do this in part by converting Spirit into dps stats, but as I said, I'm not sure that's ultimately a successful solution.<br />
<br />
(Inhale.) We put MP5 on caster mail because Resto shamans use it. We don't put it on the Elemental tier set because Resto shamans won't use that. Many mana-users can get regen out of Int and crit, but those also improve other aspects of casting. If it benefits you too much to stack those and ignore MP5 or Spirit, you are going to end up being too effective a healer compared to other classes. The design of the Holy paladin is not that you get all your regen from crit and Int. A typical raiding Holy paladin probably gets double from Illumination what she gets from DP or Replenishment. It aint trivial. If a paladin stacks say nothing but crit, then not only is Illumination better, but you heal for more too. We run the risk that as your crit rises, you outstrip the shamans, priests and druids who are having to use MP5 and Spirit too. That's why you can't just say &quot;We do use regen stats, but crit is our regen stat.&quot; If none of the healers care about regen stats at all, then mana regen is probably still too good.<br />
<br />
I know this is in the damage forum, but we totally agree about block. It has not kept up as a mitigation stat.<br />
<br />
I also agree Armor Pen is confusing. You can't look at a piece with Armor Pen vs. say AP and have a feel for whether it's an upgrade or not. If you see haste or crit, you have some idea of what that will do for you. Armor Pen may just be damage in a slightly confusing package.<br />
<br />
Long-term we could totally see merging MP5 and Spirit into one stat (with all of the class changes that would entail) but we're not ready to pull the trigger on anything like that yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223095980-discuss-itemization-without-insulting-devs.html))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
4 Tanking classes in PvE<br />
My original point was that we don't look at boss fights in terms of making sure that every tank class gets their moment to shine. That's not the goal. We also don't look at the four tank classes and make sure they all have survivability within 1% of each other in all situations. That's not the goal either.<br />
<br />
I felt the need to point that out to some of the players who may have unrealistic expectations. If certain classes have an easier time, we're totally cool with that, as long as the other classes are capable of doing it (and that includes the hard modes).<br />
<br />
Now, if one class is too good at too many bosses, or we see guilds start to replace their MTs because another tank makes the fight so much easier, then that is something of which we take notice. I'm trying to frame it in those terms so that some player don't feel compelled to respond with &quot;It's already happening in my guild,&quot; (because then the rest of the thread just becomes an unscientific tally of who uses what class for their MT) and other players respond with &quot;Oh, great, QQ got us nerfed again.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/17223093590-the-problem-is-not-dks.html))<br />

4 Pieces Moonkin Tier 8 Bonus<br />
We knew if the proc-happened mid cast that you might lose the proc. We tried to design the bonus so that wouldn’t happen often. Unfortunately with the way all of the other numbers work out, Moonkin are still chaining Starfire together a lot. We increased the proc rate to compensate, but that may not be enough, which is why we are looking into a technical solution to make the bonus apply to the next Starfire you start casting instead of the next Starfire that does damage. It might take a few days, but it will be long before the next tier of content is released. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/17223066812-any-news-on-moonkin-4pt8.html))<br />

Mana Regeneration as Holy<br />
I don't think it's the case that paladins don't care about regen. I think it's the case that they don't care about what we would call regen stats, namely MP5 and Spirit. Currently they probably over-value Int and crit. That is a potential problem because it means other healers have to spend part of their stat allocation on those stats while paladins can just stack crit (which also makes their heals bigger) and Int (which also improves their mana pool, as well as their crit).<br />
<br />
We haven't made any changes to Illumination or Replenishment at this point in time. We need to see some of the less bleeding-edge expert guilds try hard modes, where by most accounts mana regen starts to matter very much.

Restoration in PvP<br />
We agree that Resto shammies need a little help in PvP. We are working on a couple of ideas. We'll share them when we've refined them a little more. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/17345935003-why-arent-shaman-receiving-any-help.html))</div></div><hr />

Maybe they will do a Sunwell kinda thing too... First the server has to help finish the arena, then the 5 man is unlocked, a bit more dailiy grinding and the 10 man is unlocked, then the 25 man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We start out in the Arena... but the ground breaks apart and we fall onto the backs of Nerubians and have to fight through waves and waves of Trolls to get to Gnomeregan to punch all the Troggs in the face, make it a city once again, and finally remove Gnomes from every aspect of our daily lives. The end.<br />
<br />
I am mildly excited about this. Don't PvP, so 2 of the bullets are meh. I will go either way once more information comes out. Subtext: Waiting to hear that there is 0 vehicle boss fights.</div></div><hr />

You guys are jumping to conclusions way too fast. They havent even fully explained how the raid instance is going to be and they havent said enough about the bg other than its seige/resource based. Im sure theres ALOT more to the bg and and the raid than what we know already.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree, that was one of the most fun aspects of AV, before it turned into a zergfest to see what side could kill the opposing faction leader first. <br />
<br />
I'm also excited about the new 5 man dungeon. I think they should release 5 mans along with any 10/25 man raid they patch into the game, not just in expansions. A new 5 man to accompany Ulduar would have been nice.</div></div><hr />

Increasing Nitro Boots duration to 5 seconds Jewelcrafting<br />
That is an option we may explore. We also have several other changes to Nitro Boots prismatic gems in mind. We may include additional stats to making this comparable to other bootprofession enchants. Many ideas are currently on the table and we are narrowing them down to the very best. I hope that not too many of my fellow engineersjewel crafters dropped the profession because of this change.

Did you read it? It did not say raid instances, it just said &quot;5-player, 10-player, and 25-player challenges await inside.&quot; Either some world PvP thing, or maybe a vault type deal. (Although it does not rule out a Sunwell Isle style of dungeon/raids as well)<br />

bliz already announced that there will be 4 major patches in this expansion<br />

<br />
New raid sounds... disappointing. When people were hoping for Deathwing, or Gundrak, or Azjol Nerub, or Uldum, we got ring of blood. I guess they can ride the coattails of ulduar for a bit. <br />
<br />
They need to be very careful with this, the majority of people think doing jousting dailys for pets is a waste of time. If the raid centers too much around that then there could be major problems.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tirion: Yes, he attacked the people of Azeroth and have turned thousands of people into undead zombies to fight for him.<br />
<br />
Player: I hear you man. so what're ya gona do?<br />
<br />
Tirion: Well LK has suffered several setbacks since we came here so I'm gona build the biggest freaking arena in history and waste all our resourses on it and totaly ignore LK so he can regain his strenght after he was weakened in our last encounter and that should give him some time to slaughter thousands of more people to become his slaves. then when my great arena is finished everyone in Azeroth will have to come and fight stuff in it. I'll bring exotic beings from all over the world to the arena so that people have lot's of retarded stuff to kill for months while I keep ignoring LK and watch the people fight in my arena then I'll decide which one is the most worthy to follow me into Icecrown Citadel to kill LK now that he have had months to increase his army and regain strenght. I mean it's not as if the people have anything better to do right? and god forbid we attack him now that he is weak that wouldn't be fair would it. we should find a reason to kill a couple of good guys too. just something about killing good guys that makes me giggle inside.<br />
<br />
Player: yea... right... I'm just gona go over here to Account management and uhm... you know.. eh.. like.. change sex or something... yea...<br />
<br />
&quot;Player has gone offline&quot;<br />
<br />
As you might not know Tirions is actualy played by lead designer Tom Chilton himself since he couldn't keep pallys underpowered anymore he decided to play as the strongest one currently alive instead.<br />

Im guessing the coliseum will ether be a thorim like encounter, but a raid, with dudes comming in the ring from the crowd and the armory of the coliseum, and after so and so minutes, a boss will come, it sounds kinda repetitive but could be a fun short instance, and the coliseum atmosphere would be new.</div></div><hr />

People asked for a new nerubian instance, new troll instance, new dragon instance so what is one way to do that?<br />

Make an arena where you are forced to fight all of those. For example, first you face the nerubians, followed by a nerubian boss. Second, trolls then troll boss! Then dragons, ect.<br />

A few more details were also revealed in blue posts and Zarhym made an interesting comment about patch 3.3. release date.<br />
[b]Coliseum Raid Instance<br />
Yes, there will be a 5-player version, then a 10/25-player version. The bosses will be different for the two versions. Think Ring of Blood or Amphitheater of Anguish, but more epic. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17367596635-blizzard-shop-talk--under-development.html))<br />

By the wording on the WotLK packaging, it implies that &quot;The North was Forgotten until now&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have also said they want to get expansions out more often, every 18 months or so. Let's say 4 months until 3.2. That'll be 6 months between 3.0 and 3.1, and 6 months between 3.1 and 3.2. It's only logical that there's then 6 months between 3.2 and 3.3, which takes us to 18 months. However, that leaves no time for patch 3.3 to run. It's likely that it'll go 3.3, and then 4.0.<br />

3.1 came in like what 4 months?So after 4 months of Ulduar they will release a Ring Of Blood like Raid and that's it?, no seriously?Do they just wanna kill hardcore raiders and catter to bads that are stuck on Thorim easy mode or Freya atm?I know dumbing the game to retard lvl is good for busniess but do you really think it's good in the long run when the game will become so easy it will be trivial.Whatever....<br />
Good game on doublind the ret aura threat but not the thorns one , good game.So from this patch I lose like 15 or so stam and 5 agility from socket bonuses , lose threat and that while Druid tanks are kinda the worst caster mitigation tanks and while paladin tanks blow 8k sustained TPS while we can do that only with burst+berserk(3 min cd).Maybe move improved barskin to Feral Tree?I am sick of my guild telling me to go dps at Vezax hardmode cause you stupid Blizzard devs considerred its ok for us to have the weakest mitigation cooldown of all tanks(20% ...lol).<br />

-All of the other professions were more or less in-line with each other but we felt Jewelcrafting with the disabling of meta-gem requirements and the easy ability to hit 3 socket bonuses on top of getting stats from the Dragon's Eye gems put it clearly above every other profession<br />
<br />
While there is a time to buff things, if anytime there was a balance issue and we only buffed things, the numbers would rise at a rapid rate and get out of control. There is a time to buff things, but when we feel one thing is too far ahead, it's time for a nerf, which we know is never popular, but we feel it needs to be done. (Source)-GC<br />

AZJOL NERUB WAS MERELY A SETBACK, anub'rekhan and his nerubians come from underground and kill all the paladins so arthas doesnt have to fight them. <br />

pvp thing should add 3 things:<br />
making vehicles from things collected, if you collect wood + stone you can make catapults, if you collect metal+coal you make siege engines<br />

On the other hand, on level 80 classes with spell power they could hit an attacker for 1000 or more damage per hit of just passive damage that doesn't even requrie a button press. That's pretty generous. <br />
<br />
This is a baby step towards balancing Paladins. <br />
<br />
The next step should be nerfing Eye For An Eye, and in general to give Paladins of all specs the Beast Mastery Hunter treatment (i.e. nerf them to the point that in order to see how a Paladin looks like you'll need to turn to WoW Wiki). Hopefully, one day we will be able to read through Arena Statistics without seeing the words &quot;Paladin&quot; all over the place and even play in a BG where 60% of the players aren't Paladins.</div></div><hr />

Tankadins have a talent that converts stamina to spellpower, sure. But afaik druids dont.<br />

<br />
They are attempting to homogenize professions instead of buffing the ones that lack a conceivable asset. In other words, Blizzard is lazy or wants the future gems and patterns work over the current ones. But on the bright side, I still get free epic quality gems.<br />
<br />
And WoW is indeed not addictive, people play it because they like it or because they are so pathetic all they can spend their time on is doing something they do not enjoy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The next step should be nerfing Eye For An Eye, and in general to give Paladins of all specs the Beast Mastery Hunter treatment (i.e. nerf them to the point that in order to see how a Paladin looks like you'll need to turn to WoW Wiki). Hopefully, one day we will be able to read through Arena Statistics without seeing the words &quot;Paladin&quot; all over the place and even play in a BG where 60% of the players aren't Paladins.<br />

<br />
Tankadins have a talent that converts stamina to spellpower, sure. But afaik druids dont.<br />
I don't keep an eye on MTs buff since I'm not a healer, but I don't think Thorns is heaviliy used.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
lol, this was a Nerf to Ret Aura and Thorns for pvp reasons. So as rogues dont literally kill themselves while attacking targets with those buffs on them.<br />
<br />
As far as how this effects PVE, tanks mostly. Thorns on a druid tank is affected by spell power, as it is not the Druid tank that usually buffs the Thorns, but the Boomkin/Tree that buffs the tanks with it.<br />
<br />
As far as Tankadins. Almost all pally tanks use Dev aura during raids. And Ret aura is put up by the Ret Paladin in the raid, as he has the most spell power of the two.</div></div><hr />

A game that forces PvP is sooooo going to destroy WoW. Be real.<br />

Most people are still in Ulduar. Most people aren't forcing themselves to play a game they don't like because they feel the urge to fill a void in their lives. Most of Asia hasn't even seen Wrath because of their censorship laws.<br />

Judging by your post you're a retard without any clue what Aion is like, ontop you play a wrong specced male human DK with Crusader title on and you talk about Ulduar and even Ulduar hardmodes.<br />
<br />
Aion is not forcing you to pvp, you have your choices what and how you'll play the game - of course PvP is a major aspect of the game, but PvE is also one and ofc the brand new system called PvPvE :D.<br />
<br />
WotLK is released in Taiwan, and guess what Aion is more populated there than WoW. And Aion being released in ONLY 2 countries of Asia having now over 3.5mil subs with JAP servers to be released soon and Oceanic/EU/US servers to come it already beat down WoW. :)</div></div><hr />

You are one of those people who thinks blood is for DPS, frost is for tanking, and unholy is for PvP, aren't you? Also, what does my title have to do with talking about Ulduar?<br />

Personal attacks are a wonderful way of expressing the superiority of your opinion! I guess I'm removing my signature plate if it's going to attract people who will try to use it for the sake of improving their lacking opinions.<br />

And thats not true.<br />
<br />
There are 3 races (factions) in Aion - the Asmodians (dark) vs Elyos (light) vs Belaur (NPC). And also 3 major 'worlds'. One for each one of them, the Belaur being in the Abyss - endgame for PvP and PvE (there are siegeable fortresses, best farming spots, alot of doungeons etc.)<br />
<br />
You could enter the Abyss with lvl 25 and continue lvling there with more exp and better quests rewards or you can stay in your homeland and get lvl 50 there - there is no reason for you to go to the Abyss when you're lvling and its not forcing you to PvP when you go there.</div></div><hr />

Yes, there will be a 5-player version, then a 10/25-player version. The bosses will be different for the two versions. Think Ring of Blood or Amphitheater of Anguish, but more epic. (Source)<br />

Do you really think Ulduar achievements will last a year? Instances become stale after 6 months even with achievements. Yea 3.2 won't be till later this year and by then Ulduar will have been played to death and people will want something fun and new to do and not some small joke instance since we won't see Icecrown till April/May next year probably.<br />

Its not made to be a WoW killer like AoC and WAR which were also a fail on their release AND also in the beta's.<br />
<br />
No game got more positive feedback than Aion in the beta, no game had 3.5 mil subs after 3 month in 2 countries - give it 1-2 years and WoW will vanish by itselfs.<br />

3.1 came in like what 4 months?So after 4 months of Ulduar they will release a Ring Of Blood like Raid and that's it?, no seriously?Do they just wanna kill hardcore raiders and catter to bads that are stuck on Thorim easy mode or Freya atm?I know dumbing the game to retard lvl is good for busniess but do you really think it's good in the long run when the game will become so easy it will be trivial.Whatever....<br />
Good game on doublind the ret aura threat but not the thorns one , good game.So from this patch I lose like 15 or so stam and 5 agility from socket bonuses , lose threat and that while Druid tanks are kinda the worst caster mitigation tanks and while paladin tanks blow 8k sustained TPS while we can do that only with burst+berserk(3 min cd).Maybe move improved barskin to Feral Tree?I am sick of my guild telling me to go dps at Vezax hardmode cause you stupid Blizzard devs considerred its ok for us to have the weakest mitigation cooldown of all tanks(20% ...lol).<br />
Thanks for listening to the playerbase , it's obvious we LOVE siege engines bgs , no seriously WE LOVE THEM , make more , it ain't like we have vehicles quests , one bg and one open pvp zone , a raid , instance and now another RAID.THANK YOU , I am waiting on a perma vehicle class , after all I rolled my Druid to be a siege engine , demolisher or bike and pres 2-3 buttons , not actually play my class.!<br />
Also what about those Druid forms , are they even in Project phase?We are waiting for 4 YEARS for new forms and seems the Wintergrasp icon is ten times more important then our forms , I just wanna hear a word where you are making them &quot;project phase&quot;,&quot;making the animations&quot;.Give us something , each patch classes get new animations , everyone looks fancy in their tier 8.5 while we druids stick in our bearform/cat etc since lvl 10.<br />

<br />
If that's true - then you're an idiot. You obviously underestimate the power of a meta-gem. I don't know what class you are, but afaik, all classes benefit fully from a meta gem. Also, you're not supposed to put blue gems in your dps gear - that's what PURPLE is for. As a rogue, all I have to do is sacrifice 16 AP from one gem (which is partially reimbursed in the socket bonus which is +12 AP) and I get 21 agi and 3% crit damage.<br />
<br />
Let's look at that:<br />
32 AP<br />

OR<br />

28 AP + Meta gem<br />

It just cant, listen to me when I say this. It wont beat WoW, and it cant. Just because its famous in Asia that doesnt mean it will be famous over here.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have played WAY too many mmos before(around 8 ) some are even better than WoW, IN EVERY WAY, better pvp, better graphics, better leveling. But they never beat WoW. And its a phenomenon that I wont explain because it would take a wall of text to explain.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now please go to some aion forums and start ranting about how great Aion is, hopefully that will make you feel better.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Guess what, I went to check out Aion. I looks amazing, looks fun, looks better than WoW to some extent, but truth is, its not better than WoW. You dont get it now, but you probably will in some years.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Aion has 1.500+ quests on release, 500+ more than WoW had on its release for 2 continents. Aion EU/US will be on par with the patches etc. as asian Aion - there want be just a little gap of 1-2 days once its released. Its not made to be a WoW killer like AoC and WAR which were also a fail on their release AND also in the beta's.<br />
<br />
No game got more positive feedback than Aion in the beta, no game had 3.5 mil subs after 3 month in 2 countries - give it 1-2 years and WoW will vanish by itselfs.<br />
<br />
It has 100x better graphics than WoW and nearly the same systems requirements, which will also allow the dumb folks in it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok whatever , I was playing Everquest when you still had fun with your weener in the sand.Go play Aion and send me emails each week how awesome it is.<br />
<br />
Ps: Calling everyone a retard when your brain is the size of a peanut doesn't help prove your point , boy.</div></div><hr />

When Epic Gems come out from Ice Crown, what then? They'll be better than Storm Jewels. And Storm Jewels are Not that far from Dragons Eyes. So, the point of JC will be ..............? Nothing? JC is a tanking profession by far. Nerfing tanks is stupid as hell.</div></div><hr />

If something like a JC change makes you quit because you gotta plan for your meta then by all means go, and if your argument is new rare gems will replace the current dragon eye ones then by that reasoning BS epic crafts should be hard to replace. In regards to Aion I've played it and all I have to say is that I hope your computers can take it because it's not as forgiving as WoW and it's just alright imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Professions are an OPTIONAL extension of your class. nothing more.<br />
Blizzard screwed up when they granted statistical edge via picking up certain trade skills.<br />
Which in turn, made a path that has always been completely optional, a little more required. (And in many hardcore min/max guilds, a 100% requirement. At least back in BC)<br />
<br />
I've been disgusted at how long Blizzard has let this go on, Jewelcrafting especially. <br />
<br />
I don't mind min/maxing(ers). But there is no excuse for trade skills to fall prey to the concept.<br />
<br />
I applaud Blizzard for finally taking this step. It won't fix the problem, but hopefully it will fluctuate the economy some, and take some of the whiners down a few pegs. <br />
Your cries won't be heard. They don't carry any weight; you picked a profession for the stats and not the crafting aspect of it. <br />
Jewelcrafting had it coming, and you should have known better to not get comfortable with an over-powered profession.<br />
<br />
They'll never strike a 100% balance. But there damn should be some when it comes to stat bonuses from having a profession.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. No vehicles<br />
2. Different from Ulduar theme, I'm 100% sick of giant sci-fi Stargate looking buildings. Give us a desert theme or something.<br />
3. No vehicles.<br />
4. 40 vs 40 as in 40 vs 40 not 40 passes by 40 to take out the leader in minutes.<br />
5. NO GOD DAMN VEHICLES!!!<br />
<br />
The raid sounds very intersting though, as long as they don't whack out vehicles in it I'm quite happy. The new patch will hopefully implement dance studios and BG rated matches so it looks promising.<br />

<br />
L-O-L ROFLMAO!!! Now I understand why this game hasnt gone past Asia. It looks like a fucking piece of crap that will never ever beat WoW. The only MMO that I see ever beating WoW is another blizzard MMO. Go post about your Asian MMO somewhere else and take your 3 inches elsewhere! :o</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
to all those people saying that they looked up info on aion, etc etc, ive actually been playing it for quite a while now on chinese servers since the enlgish patch for it was released. <br />
<br />
ive been playing wow for almost two years now, and after playing aion for a month, ive decided its already better than wow. <br />
<br />
now before people start telling me 'oh you didnt play in bc, oh you are a casual' blah blah, ive expirienced both games equally, and seeing my fair share of bad mmos from NC, i will have to say that aion was completely unexpected. aion has everything wow lacks, amazing graphics, lore just as good as wow, a fun class developement, and as far as ive seen, no class is rediculously OP needing a nerf. its got the right amount of balance between pvp and pve, and you can dance like a cheerleader to boot. need i say more? /cheer<br />
<br />
EDIT: also, the whole reason this game was released in asia first was because asians take their betas seriously, not like the fucktards that were in the wotlk beta that asked me over 50 times where the chapel was on their DK because they were lost without their questhelper.<br />
<br />
best thing about aion? built in questhelper motherfucka &lt;3</div></div><hr />

First off, trust me - you're doing better by just deleting all your forum accounts, you're a waste of databank space.<br />
<br />
Talking only about graphics, everyone who doesnt agree with me that Aion has atleast 10x better graphics than WoW is rather blind or simply retarded. Tastes differs of course, but hating anime is not a reason to see the quality put in those graphics. <br />
<br />
And also learn to read and if your older brother is reading for you, get some reading comprehension - it was first released in Asia, because its made their, and it takes 3x more time to translate from korean to what-so-ever other asian language than an EU or US westizimation. In case you dont know how long time such a process needs, and you dont know it for sure, I highly recommend you to finish the elementary school before playing MMOs.<br />

@Chaosshadow (didnt see it):<br />
<br />
I played nearly every MMO in the last 10 years, nothing even came near the experiance Aion has provided to me and my friends - NOTHING, read: N O T H I N G.<br />
<br />
I like how you're trying to force people to believe your opinion, but like I said before - it IS already a huge success, and has already 1/3 of WoW's subs just in 2 countries, and its going be to released soon fully updated, translated, localized in EU/US. <br />
<br />
I hoped you enjoy getting proved wrong by me, if you want to continue the discussion, just re-quote. &lt;3<br />
<br />
<br />
@Mslagsalot:<br />
<br />
If you saw WotLK you saw everything in WoW, well it was great in TBC - now its just a piece of crap. Its not only the gameplay which changed but the community got also fucked up. I quoted 2 perfect examples before. ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mslagsalot</div><div class="date">2009-05-24, 09:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">sync i totally agree with you. if World of warcraft was still in the burning crusade i can gurantee my guild would still be raiding sunwell. tbc had my favorite instances in it. NOTHING about burning crusade was bad. cept for the rep grind to unlock sunwell, but still it was fun nonetheless. the only fight ive even considered remotely fun in wotlk was 6 minute maly, and even that was lame. Video games are video games, and everyone has their different tastes, but if you ever change your mind about wow, aion is waiting for you, and so is my cleric &lt;3<br />
