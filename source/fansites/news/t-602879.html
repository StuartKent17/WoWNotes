Wrath of the Lich King<br />
There will be more than one type of siege weapon but there isn't any final list of them yet. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2518770867&amp;postId=25734830616&amp;sid=1#4))<br />

Interface<br />
The spam-protection preventing multi-lines messages in guild and private chat channels is now removed, it will only be active in chat channels with more than 25 users. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2512087883&amp;postId=25734529966&amp;sid=1#36))<br />

2.3 Testing<br />
The issue with the guild bank locking up when opened has been identified, and will be fixed in a later build. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2509269840&amp;postId=25749422814&amp;sid=1#37))<br />

Flying mounts in Azeroth seems to definitely be something Blizzard wants to implement at some point. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=2040217823&amp;postId=25734528161&amp;sid=1#6))<br />

<br />
Also, two set bonuses got changed, probably in the first build of the 2.3 PTR but I never reported them.<br />
<br />
Paladin Tier 5 (Healing)<br />
(2) Set: Each time you cast a Judgement, your party members gain 50 mana.<br />
Old bonus: Increases the armor granted by your Devotion Aura ability by 350.<br />
(4) Set: Your critical heals from Flash of Light and Holy Light reduce the cast time of your next Holy Light spell by 0.5 sec for 10 sec. This effect cannot occur more than once per minute.<br />
Old bonus: Reduces the casting time of your Holy Light spell by 0.2 sec.<br />
<br />
Shaman Tier 5 (Healing)<br />
(2) Set: Reduces the cost of your Lesser Healing Wave spell by 5%.<br />
Old bonus: Reduces the cost of your Lesser Healing Wave spell by 3%.<br />
(4) Set: Your critical heals from Healing Wave, Lesser Healing Wave, and Chain Heal reduce the cast time of your next Healing Wave spell by 0.5 sec for 10 sec. This effect cannot occur more than once per minute.<br />
Old bonus: Reduces the casting time of your Healing Wave spell by 0.2 sec. In addition, your critical heals from Healing Wave, Lesser Healing Wave, and Chain Heal reduce the cast time of your next Healing Wave spell by 0.2 sec.<br />

Unlimited Escapism vol. 0: Shock Your Senses<br />
It's been a long time since the last video posted in news ! Anyway, Baron Soosdon released another volume of Unlimited Escapism (http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=48525), as usual it's really really nice, and you'll probably enjoy it if you liked the others. <br />

The devotion aura bonus while not spectacular was at least mildly useful if you were in the MT group but who is going to be casting judgement while healing in a raid situation? It would be a better bonus for a Retri paladin (though it may encourage putting him in a caster group which would be bad). The healing bonus change is a serious nerf though, same goes for the shaman set.<br />
<br />
A chance, once per minute to proc a 10 second debuff that you may or may not get to use before it expires. What a totally crappy set bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Totally agree, i was thinking that they accidently had put retribtuion set bonuses on the item, but then i saw the 4set bonus :(<br />
<br />
I actually liked the Devotion Aura bonus, while no good healing bonus it would increase the tanks armor by a lot if he's not a druid. Give new bonuses, or atleast the old ones :(</div></div><hr />
