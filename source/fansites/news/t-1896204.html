Legion Class Preview Series: Mage<br />
Welcome to our World of Warcraft: Legion class preview series. In this entry, we’re exploring the Mage—to find out what’s in store for a different class, check out the overview. <br />
<br />
We continue our early look at class and specialization design with the Mage. In these blogs, we’ll be exploring class identity, discussing Legion’s new designs, and presenting core combat abilities for each specialization—laying out the foundation upon which talents and Artifacts will build further. With that in mind, let’s delve into what it means to be a Mage in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
In terms of spec definition and overall design changes, Mages lay in contrast to the classes we’ve talked about so far in this series. Mages are in a very strong place compared to most classes, both thematically and mechanically. There’s a lot of distinction among Arcane, Fire, and Frost Mages, with each type of caster specializing heavily in a single school of magic, and each of the three schools having strong themes and consistent properties. Arcane magic warps time and space, and controls the flow of mana; Fire magic unleashes destructive force that spreads chaotically; and Frost slows and controls, setting foes up for devastating strikes.<br />
<br />
The changes we’re making are more to prop up existing gameplay for all skill levels and provide some quality-of-life improvements. As a simple example, Summon Refreshment now automatically provides you with a stack of food if you’re adventuring out on your own, or a table of refreshments when in a party or raid.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Arcane<br />
Mages of the arcane are diviners of secrets, balancing the ebb and flow of incredible mystic energies. Unparalleled skill is required to manipulate the volatile forces of the universe. These practitioners push their magical knowledge to its very limits—often to the brink of their own exhaustion, and at great risk to the world around them. Those who master this craft are capable of releasing a barrage of unrelenting power upon their enemies, drawing upon replenishing energies to maintain their assault for as long as the battle demands. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mages of the arcane are diviners of secrets, balancing the ebb and flow of incredible mystic energies&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Arcane Mage abilities and gameplay already deliver on the spec’s fantasy quite well, so most changes are in the vein of polishing what’s already there. First, for added mechanical clarity, Arcane Charges are now an actual resource located underneath your Mana bar instead of a stacking debuff. The functionality is still very much the same, but this change should make their accumulation and use more distinct. The one significant gameplay change is that Arcane has a new Mastery, which increases your maximum Mana by a percentage, and increases the damage bonus from Arcane Charges. This should make the Mastery feel a bit more interesting by allowing more aggressive Mana usage as your Mastery improves, and feel more empowering, ultimately giving you much more control over your rotation.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Arcane Mages:<br />
<br />
Arcane Blast<br />
<br />
5% Mana, 40 yd range, 2.25 sec cast<br />
Blasts the target with energy, dealing moderate Arcane damage and generating an Arcane Charge.<br />
Arcane Blast’s damage is increased by 50% per Arcane Charge, and its Mana cost is increased by 100% per Arcane Charge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arcane Missiles<br />
<br />
40 yd range, Channeled<br />
Launches five waves of Arcane Missiles at the enemy over 2 sec, causing minor Arcane damage per wave. Generates an Arcane Charge.<br />
Arcane Missiles’ damage is increased by 50% per Arcane Charge.<br />
Arcane Missiles has a chance to be activated after each of your damaging spell casts. Limit 3 charges.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arcane Barrage<br />
<br />
0.5% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant, 3 sec cooldown<br />
Launches bolts of arcane energy at the enemy target, causing strong Arcane damage. Consumes all Arcane Charges.<br />
Arcane Barrage’s damage is increased by 50% per Arcane Charge, and it hits 1 additional nearby target per Arcane Charge for 50% damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Evocation<br />
<br />
Channeled, 1.5 min cooldown<br />
Gain 25% of your total Mana instantly, and another 75% of your total mana over 6 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Savant<br />
<br />
Increases your Mana regeneration rate and maximum Mana by 20% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
Arcane Charges increase the damage of affected spells by an additional 10% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
<br />
<br />
Displacement<br />
<br />
Instant, 1.5 min cooldown<br />
For the next 4 sec, casting Blink will not trigger its cooldown<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Arcane-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Quickening<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Arcane Blast and Arcane Missiles also grant 2% Haste for 6 sec, stacking.<br />
This effect is cleared when you cast Arcane Barrage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Fire<br />
While any worthy mage is an unparalleled expert in the use of magic and heavily dedicated to their craft, those who master the forces of fire tend to be a little more audacious than their peers. If a threat stands before them, the answer is always to neutralize it in a glorious blaze. A lifetime dedicated to the study of fiery forces only fuels their pyromania, and these mages take pride—even pleasure—in igniting their enemies in wild bursts of flame. Mistake their affinity for watching things burn as a lack of self-control at your own peril. <br />
<br />
&quot;These mages take pride—even pleasure—in igniting their enemies in wild bursts of flame&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Similar to Arcane, Fire already exudes its core identity, so our changes are focused on gameplay adjustments. Ultimately, you will have more freedom in what buttons you press and more control over the Heating Up mechanic, which is core to Fire Mages. In particular, the Inferno Blast ability was trying to fill two roles: spreading Ignite, and forcing a Hot Streak from a Heating Up. We’ve opted to move the spreading to an innate property of Ignite and have taken Inferno Blast off the global cooldown so that you can more freely and intuitively use it to trigger a Hot Streak.<br />
<br />
Another major change is the redesign of Combustion. It’s an incredibly complex skill, hard to understand for most people, and has the potential for either ridiculous success or critical failure, with the odds being extremely random and very hard to gauge much of the time. We’re redesigning it into something that fits into the Fire rotation in a clear and consistent way.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Fire Mages:<br />
<br />
Fireball<br />
<br />
4% Mana, 40 yd range, 2.25 sec cast<br />
Throw a fiery ball that causes moderate Fire damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hot Streak<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Getting 2 direct-damage critical strikes in a row will make your next Pyroblast or Flamestrike spell instant cast, and cause double the normal Ignite damage.<br />
Developer Comment:<br />
<br />
You may not start a new streak (aka, gain Heating Up), while a Hot Streak is already active<br />
It was never our intention for players to sit with a Hot Streak active, then keep fishing for another Heating Up before throwing instant Pyro out—in general, we don’t like the game telling you to press a button when you shouldn’t<br />
<br />
<br />
Inferno Blast<br />
<br />
2% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant, 12 sec recharge, 2 charges<br />
Blasts the enemy for moderate Fire damage. This damage is always a critical strike.<br />
Inferno Blast is not on the global cooldown, and can be cast while casting other spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pyroblast<br />
<br />
5% Mana, 40 yd range, 4.5 sec cast<br />
Hurl an immense fiery boulder that causes massive Fire damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combustion<br />
<br />
10% Mana, Instant, 2 min<br />
Engulf yourself in flames, increasing your critical strike chance by 100% for 10 sec.<br />
Also grants you Mastery equal to your Critical Strike stat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Ignite<br />
<br />
Your target burns for an additional 30% (with Mastery from typical gear) over 9 sec of the total direct damage caused by your Fireball, Inferno Blast, Scorch, Pyroblast, and Flamestrike. If this effect is reapplied, any remaining damage will be added to the new Ignite.<br />
Every 2 sec, your Ignites may spread to another nearby enemy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Fire-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Cinderstorm<br />
<br />
1% Mana, 40 yd range, 1.5 sec cast, 8 sec cooldown<br />
Throw a spread of 6 cinders that travel in an arc, and each deal minor Fire damage to enemies they hit.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Frost<br />
Frost mages stand apart from their colleagues, in that their chosen school of magic focuses on maintaining supreme control over the capabilities of their enemies. Mages who command frost perform chilling displays on the battlefield, rendering foes immobile as they bombard them with ice. Often, the blade never reaches the caster before the bitter cold takes hold. The frost mage exudes frigid power as icicles form around them, foreshadowing the wintry demise of those who stand opposed on the field of battle. <br />
<br />
&quot;Mages who command frost perform chilling displays on the battlefield, rendering foes immobile&quot;<br />
<br />
Gameplay<br />
Frost Mages are very effective casters, and there’s already a lot to like about this spec. Frost’s defining traits and abilities are cohesive, the mechanics are understandable, and there are plenty of opportunities for players to explore unique gameplay at a variety of skill levels. Rather than making any dramatic changes to how a Frost Mage plays, we’ve focused more on fixing one particular outlier in their Spellbook: Frostfire Bolt. After removing the fire portion of the spell, it began to feel like just another Frostbolt, and we started to wonder how a spell supposedly combining frost and fire wasn’t just producing a puddle of water at the feet of the enemy. We’ve removed Frostfire Bolt and made Frozen Orb part of the core spell kit in its place, which better lends itself to the identity of the Frost Mage.<br />
<br />
Here’s a basic look at the core combat abilities for Frost Mages:<br />
<br />
Frost Bolt<br />
<br />
4% Mana, 40 yd range, 2 sec cast<br />
Launches a bolt of frost at the enemy, causing moderate Frost damage and slowing movement speed by 30% for 15 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frozen Orb<br />
<br />
10% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant, 1 min cooldown<br />
Launches an orb of swirling ice forward, dealing minor Frost damage every 1 sec to all nearby enemy targets for 10 sec. Grants the Mage 1 charge of Fingers of Frost when it first reaches a target.<br />
Targets damaged by the Frost Orb are slowed by 30% for 2 sec.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ice Lance<br />
<br />
1% Mana, 40 yd range, Instant.<br />
Quickly fling a shard of ice at the target, dealing minor Frost damage.<br />
Ice Lance damage is doubled against frozen targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Brain Freeze<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your Frostbolts have a 10% chance to reset the cooldown of Frozen Orb.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fingers of Frost<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Your successful Frostbolt hits have a 15% chance, and your Blizzard and Frozen Orb ticks have a 5% chance to grant you the Fingers of Frost effect.<br />
The Fingers of Frost effect causes your next Ice Lance to act as if your target were frozen, and deal 140% increased damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shatter<br />
<br />
Passive<br />
Multiplies the critical strike chance of your spells against Frozen targets by 1.5, and adds an additional 50% chance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery: Icicles<br />
<br />
When you damage enemies with Frostbolt, 45% (with Mastery from typical gear) of the damage done is stored as an Icicle with you, for 30 sec. Also increases the damage that your Water Elemental deals by 45% (with Mastery from typical gear).<br />
Up to 5 Icicles can be stored at once. Excess Icicles that are generated will be automatically launched. Casting Ice Lance causes any Icicles to begin launching at the target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, to give you an idea of how some talents may build upon this, here’s an example of one of their Frost-specific talents:<br />
<br />
Glacial Spike<br />
<br />
1% Mana, 40 yd range, 3 sec cast<br />
Conjure a massive spike of ice, and merge your current Icicles into it. It impales your target, dealing massive damage, plus the damage stored in your Icicles.<br />
Requires 5 Icicles to cast.<br />
Also freezes the target in place for up to 4 sec. Damage caused may interrupt the effect.<br />
Passive: Ice Lance no longer launches Icicles.<br />
<br />
<br />
We hope you’ve enjoyed this early preview of our approach to Mage class and specialization design in World of Warcraft: Legion. We’ll continue our series next with a look at Paladins.</div></div><hr />

I don't play mage, but having a talent that takes a passive mastery effect and turns it into a rotation where I store up icicles and then fire them all at once for big damage is very interesting. Will be nice to line up with trinket procs ect for those willing to go the extra mile to track such events to benefit from the talent. Hope they do this for warlocks :).

Im not playing mage ever again if thats the case, the only specc i ever enjoyed as mage was fire, i REALLY enjoy fire tho, but generally i hate swapping speccs based on fights, and i really don't want to have to specc into a specc i don't like the feel off.</div></div><hr />

100% agree sir. Fire will be nothing more than launching a fireball with the occasional pyroblast. Now we can't even bank a heating up. Stupid.</div></div><hr />

They said that half the classes are getting talents to add into core rotation and not only for just cooldowns. Don't over react just yet wait till we see the talents they change.</div></div><hr />

But this is like, trying hard to remove even the fun parts, like hunge combustions and streaks. Pointless.<br />
<br />
On the upside, really like the other specs, especially the talents. Galcial Spike FTW:D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because everything is &quot;too difficult&quot; and &quot;too complex&quot; for their least common denominator. <br />
<br />
Apparently we can't manage snap-shotting, or monitor when to combust, or when to bank pyros or when not to, or hell even when to spread our DoTs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmmm seems like they made it better in my opinion. The current version sucks big ones. Let me see do I want a combustion that I am tracking ignite and only can cast it when certain conditions are met or it will be a dps loss with very little visual effect when i cast it or would I want to turn into Fucking Dragonball Z surrounded by Flames doing a shit ton more damage when I want to do so. Now everyone will know when a fire mage is about to go HAM!!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It sucks to raid with a firemage tho, 1 try they do either no damage or 200% the next try. Very unreliable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That love/hate relationship is something that should not exist in a video game where the core element is to have fun. I don't want to have to play my favourite spec where a huge chunk of my DPS was up to the gods of fate. The changes make the spec a lot more fun.</div></div><hr />

Some classes get fundamental overhauls. We get the removal of the only skillcap in fire (Combustion), and RNG frost (rng off frozen orb,) , rng ignite. I had a degree of hope, but I guess they view mage as a finished class, which is a shame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LOL I so love this response. Love how everyone says that DPS is dumbed down and so easy yet when I raid there is more of a gap now in dps than ever before when you compare a great player to someone that raids at a LFR/Normal raid level.<br />
<br />
Also when you compare each role now Tanks are the easiest to play in raid, then heals and dps for prolly the first time is the hardest spec to play correctly in raids right now! Only thing i see wrong is they took the control of DPS away and they said we was getting that back in Legion.</div></div><hr />

This sucks though. I like when a class gets a big overall in a new expansion. I am already getting bored of mage in WoD and we still have 9 months left.

They are only doing major changes to classes that lack spec identity and feel off from their class fantasy.<br />
<br />
Mage has always been very defined and even more so in WoD, Im willing to bet legion talents will further cement this.<br />
<br />
You are literally asking for them to change a class that they feel is perfectly in line with what they want it to be, simply because you want some change of pace.</div></div><hr />

Its not that great of a spell.. Its good for running flags and running away.. If you are fighting someone you Blink they will use some ability to get right at you again (like charge and what not) then you cast Displacement to Blink again, but then you gotta stop to attack the person Arcane Blast or Missiles then MAYBE you have time for 1 more blink if you are lucky and they didnt silence you in some way.. It's really just a running away spell if anything</div></div><hr />

For 10 seconds, you are gaining loads of insta-crits and 130+% ignite ticks on your abilities. Can you imagine flinging 120K Pyroblasts, maybe 3 - 4 within this 10 second window, with your ignite stacking to around about 300k damage over 9 seconds, on average?<br />

<br />
You mean why did they FIX Combustion? It's because Fire has turned to shit.<br />
<br />
By going back to old school Combustion you now get a guaranteed giant Ignite rolling which you can then spread with Fireblast, rather than now where you pray to the RNGods to give you a nice streak of crits whenever it's coming off cooldown.<br />
<br />
It might actually be too good, since the old effect of doubling Ignite damage is now baked into Hot Streak.</div></div><hr />

It helps that the three different specs are visually different, I guess that's how Blizzard sees it too.<br />

Back when it was introduced in Wrath, I used the glyph for it that made it identical (stat-wise) to Fireball so I could use it as the filler spell in place of Fireball because I thought it looked so cool. Maybe that will hang around as a visual glyph... though I doubt it, since they're all about &quot;spec identity&quot; now. Honestly, the idea of combining two specs in a spell like that is cool to me, but they seem to really be against that now.<br />
My initial reaction to the Combustion change was negative, because it was satisfying when you lined everything up and got a good one. But I though about it more, and it's probably for the best. It really sucked when you messed up Combustion.<br />
Everything else hasn't changed much, so not much to say. Sounds good to me. Although it sounds like Frost Mage cleave may be gone? Since it was not mentioned in these spells and major glyphs aren't going to exist anymore. Could be in the talents, though.</div></div><hr />

You may not start a new streak (aka, gain Heating Up), while a Hot Streak is already active<br />
It was never our intention for players to sit with a Hot Streak active, then keep fishing for another Heating Up before throwing instant Pyro out—in general, we don’t like the game telling you to press a button when you shouldn’t<br />
<br />
I've only dabbled in the Fire spec on my mage alt, due to the Cataclysm system changes to Arcane. Don't really care for Fire, so I'm pretty much Frost full-time. Having stated all that: The nerf to the Heating Up mechanic is utter BS.<br />
<br />
Any Fire mage worth their salt would not sit on a Hot Streak when it becomes available, given general circumstances. Sometimes a situation does arise wherein the player finds that it is better to hold off, but that doesn't occur often.<br />
<br />
No, the real reason here is not about players being mislead by the game system -- Blizzard just doesn't want Fire mages chaining Pyroblasts.<br />
<br />
Edit: This all rather reminds me of Ghostcrawler's famously idiotic and clueless statement on druids using nothing but Rejuvenation in the heroic Lich King encounter, and using that as a reason in greatly increasing that ability's mana cost in Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

For me all 3 speccs always were far too similar. Thats why the class never appealed to me, it felt more like I am choosing the color of the bolts I am firing and not like I am actually choosing a different specc. <br />
<br />
Compared to other pure dps classes, they always felt pretty generic.<br />
* Hunter has survival/marksmanship which are quite similar but has a tree purely focused on the pet to make up for it. <br />
* Warlock has either direct dmg, dots or demons. <br />
<br />
While mage also has this differences like water elemental or fire dots, I always felt they were more gimmicks instead of core mechanics.</div></div><hr />

Towards the end of the expansion of WoD (and even midway), FFB was a reliable source of damage...and now it's being replaced by a 10% chance to reset frozen orb. Over the long term, I'm sure the numbers will equal. But in short duration fights the propensity for RNG to kick you in the butt seems large. With that being said, The Glacial Spikke ability looks awesome! Reminds me of deep freeze and definitely a mechanic that PvE Frost Mages miss seeing those massive numbers.</div></div><hr />

I was hoping they'd make that baseline in Legion, but they've gone even further which I didn't expect but it's more than welcome. <br />
<br />
I'm also happy they removed the old Combustion too. Through very little skill but mostly pure RNG, your dps would vary far too much purely based on timings of crits (or lack of, mostly). Anything that takes that frustration away is only a good thing. The only issue now is fire seems a bit too simple. Probably needs something added to raise the skill-cap (maybe a secondary resource to manage, that seems like Blizzards answer to most things, no matter how annoying it makes the class become). <br />
<br />
All in all, pretty happy with the changes. Still early days so I'm sure things will change.</div></div><hr />

The complaint is that as far as the core game play goes the class is lackluster and not diverse at all. What they have shown for mages reflects their design choice, 3 specs that feel extremely similar. I don't see them introducing talents that allow specs to feel distinct from one another.<br />
<br />
Once beta hits things are to set in stone to be changed. So what will waiting for beta accomplish?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, it's called beta because things AREN'T set in stone. That's kind of what beta is FOR. Last beta my druid was re-iterated many many times.<br />
<br />
And the guy who said &quot;So we aren't going to be getting any talents that change how spells work? Damn....&quot;, well HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY KNOW. We barely know anything yet!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apparently we can't manage snap-shotting, or monitor when to combust, or when to bank pyros or when not to, or hell even when to spread our DoTs.<br />
<br />
They already said there'll be a lot more abilities made into talents. No doubt to excel you'll need to delve into additional active talent abilities.</div></div><hr />

What feels the similar about them? How much more diverse could they be made?<br />
<br />
It's a beta...why would they even bother having a beta if things were set in stone? Classes get changed constantly in beta. <br />
- Early on in wod beta mages frost armor was changed from haste to multistrike<br />
- You were able to indefinitely spam non FoF ice lances to extend your Icy Veins<br />
- Prismatic Crystal used to release all the damage you did into it when it expired rather then each time you hit it<br />
- FFB had a cast time even with a proc<br />
- Frost Nova would teleport you behind yourself when you cast it<br />
<br />
That's just what I can remember off the top of my head for mages. There were heaps of changes made to all classes as beta progressed. Everyone should just relax at the very least until they have released a list of all the spells/talents they plan to give us, instead of raging at the pre-alpha notes...<br />

They should just make it a minor glyph (for both frostbolt and firebolt) and be done with it.</div></div><hr />

Bet they will put back multistrike as the elem mastery.<br />
<br />
Can't wait to see what they cooked up for shamans. been only playing enh for a long time now.</div></div><hr />

Multistrike will be gone in Legion. Unfortunately, people will still be stuck with Versatility because Blizzard thinks there's situational value in the latter, while the former is redundant and boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New arcane blast is works exactly the same as it did before, but new AB costs 5% of mana instead of 2% like on live. They say that the new mastery should allow mages ''more aggressive Mana usage as your Mastery improves'', but if a single AB costs 25% of your mana with four arcane charge instead of 10% like on live, we will be able to cast at best 5 fully charged AB before running into conservation phase.<br />
<br />
I really like AB spam when i want burst damage. It would be a shame to be OOM within the first five seconds of a bloodlust.<br />
<br />
Otherwise i really like the change the Arcane's new mastery!</div></div><hr />

Actually it doesn't diminish. During combustion, you get mastery equal to your crit, so the more crit you have when you hit Combustion, the bigger your mastery numbers will be. Its fairly elegant actually.<br />
<br />
I'm withholding judgement until we see the Artifact abilities and new talents. Assuming there are real, valid choices and a good number of active abilities to choose from, it could work out nicely.</div></div><hr />

<br />
First: Frost bolt slows the target by 30% only! It's 50% now. We will be overwhelmed by melee classes in Legion (demon hunter, survival hunter - hell Blizz loves hunters...- and rogues with outlaw spec). It's very disturbing, also regenerative ice major glyph will be removed.<br />
<br />
Second: The revealed talent Glacial spike is a 3 sec cast. It's way too much in pvp (sometimes you can't even cast a ~1 sec Frostjaw).<br />
<br />
I can't see how these changes will make this sentence viable:<br />
<br />
&quot;Mages who command frost perform chilling displays on the battlefield, rendering foes immobile&quot;<br />
<br />
Bonus: &quot;Mages should focus on avoiding/absorbing damage. We don't like self-healing for them. Instead, we made Ice Barrier class-wide.&quot;<br />
<br />
How can you deal proper damage if you have to focus on avoiding/absorbing enemy damage in this new world of Legion where most of the melee classes can reach their target from 20-25 yards already?<br />
<br />
(Old: melee, ranged; New: mid-ranged, ranged. No melee anymore.)<br />
<br />
Bloody mess.</div></div><hr />

And another spell to get out of combat called, &quot;Oh $#!&quot;. That's pretty much how fighting works. Get really good at ripping arms off, or punching their face, or backing out so that you can go back to step 1. All that other fluff and 0.5% this, 10% that, and 1.5 minute cool down that is annoying.</div></div><hr />

Manacosts are always based on Basemana not Maxmana. Some blue even stated so. <br />
Also Arcane Mastery will increase Maxmana and maybe Manareggen so you can spam more AB. With all the item budget inflation I doubt that those additional 3% of Basemana will be noticable</div></div><hr />
