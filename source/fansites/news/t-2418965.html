We get no good rewards, no awesome invasions across the world. Just some shitty cut scene. I'm so disappointed I feel like we are going back to Panda land all over again. Legion was just amazing and now this... I just don't know about Blizzard anymore...</div></div><hr />

Kind of similar story to all the NPCs which you fight to 1 hp then they are like &quot;I tire if this, lul&quot;, pop up some fancy invulnerability and stun you, then run away.</div></div><hr />

It is honestly boggling my mind at how little thought they seem to be putting into the actual pre-patch events this time considering how much attention they are putting into it in every other avenue outside the game. 3 weeks of ho-hum daily quests and a gated chain are not getting me jazzed to kick off this new patch. Its a real shame.</div></div><hr />

This is equivalent to the Broken Shore scenario. The equivalent to the invasions of Legion, was the War of Thorns: The Mount, the World Quests on Darkshore. THAT is your pre-expansion event. This, the Battle for Lordaeron, is the first quest for Battle for Azeroth, that everyone will have to do once, before getting the Heart of Azeroth, and moving on to Zandalar or Kul Tiras.<br />
<br />
The fact the item was a mere 180, was the same as doing the Broken Shore, that awarded rather worthless weapons just to immediately replace with the Artifact Weapons. These 180 weapons are not intended for people doing the current world quests: They are intended for new players who just get to 110 for the first time, AFTER the expansion launches, who aren't skipping the event (cause they can't, as their first), to get a better weapon over their &quot;Artifact&quot; that will likely be below 180. Not every quest is for the majority. This quest does NOT go away next week. It's only the War of Thorns questline and world quests that do.</div></div><hr />

First of all, to all the people complaining about Jaina’s father’s ship, two weeks ago we saw her raise the ship from the depths of the ocean. She’s canonically one of, if not the most powerful mage in Azeroth. Is it too impossible to believe in a fantasy world, a character who is already established as an incredibly power sorceress can’t use arcane and frost magic to make cannons fire? Hell in Silvermoon elves enchant brooms to sweep and side tables to float. Buildings even float in Silvermoon. On top of that, I think it’s fair to say, yes you can criticize something, but don’t be an asshole. There’s people who worked hard to write these stories and there are fans who are super excited about them, so it’s disrespectful, unnecessary, and rude to jump the gun and take a **** all over these peoples hard work.<br />
<br />
Personally I think Jainas entrance on the ship was badass, and to anyone who says going into the throne room was a bad idea, were the alliance leaders meant to just stop at the front door and let them get away? To all of the people who think they could have written better, what other direction do you recommend? Bunch of inconsiderate a-holes</div></div><hr />

<br />
and so the white knight shows up XD really being rude with rudes won't give you any shining armor.<br />
apart this let's get to the topic: maybe you missed one point about Elsa errm sorry i mean jaina.<br />
ok she is one of the most powerful mages in azeroth and i'm fine about she becomina able to make an entire battleship fly but why not use it properly then.<br />
do you realize that she just opened a hole in a wall with that? A HOLE! what about shooting around destroying the city and maybe sylvanas BEFORE she could blow up the city with the blight? <br />
the bad writing is all here; not about badass moments but the use the characters do of their resources, they say/do one thing a moment and the moment after they to the opposite because in that moment is more badass to do that.<br />
inconsistency is the word learn it.</div></div><hr />
