Upcoming PvP Tuning Changes<br />
We're going to be making a few PvP tuning changes early next week, with a focus on Guardian Druids. Due to how close these changes will be to the next North American Qualifier tournament, we wanted to give everyone advanced warning. These changes are still in test (and could change), and will not be applied to live servers until Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Demon Hunter - Havoc:<br />
-Chaotic Onslaught can no longer cause Chaos Strike to trigger more than one additional Chaos Strike in PvP situations.<br />
-Rain from Above will now properly suppress all root effects when cast, such as Frost Nova.<br />
<br />
Druid - Guardian:<br />
-Pawsitive Outlook can no longer cause Thrash to trigger more than one additional Thrash in PvP situations.<br />
-Sharpened Claws increases Thrash and Swipe damage by 25%, down from 50%.<br />
-Frenzied Regeneration now heals for 25% of damage taken in the last 5 seconds, down from 50%.<br />
-PvP Template Agility reduced by 5%.<br />
-PvP Template Stamina reduced by 5%.<br />
<br />
Monk - Brewmaster:<br />
-Stave Off can no longer cause Keg Smash to trigger more than one additional Keg Smash in PvP situations.<br />
<br />
Warrior - Fury:<br />
-Oathblood can no longer cause Bloodthirst to trigger more than one additional Bloodthirst in PvP situations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recent Actions Against Win-Trading<br />
We’ve recently taken action against a number of accounts involved in win-trading in Rated Battlegrounds. This is a clear violation of the World of Warcraft Terms of Service, as well as the spirit of competitive play.<br />
<br />
When we took these actions, we believed that the accounts being affected were used primarily by seller agencies, who exchange in-game wins for real-world currency, and not for normal gameplay, and so they were issued permanent closures. Once those actions were completed, we started hearing from players whose accounts had been affected but were not affiliated with a seller agency.<br />
<br />
We then began an immediate re-investigation of all accounts. That investigation concluded that there were indeed some players caught in this action who should not have been hit with a permanent account closure. Those that were not involved with seller agencies but still found to be purposefully involved in win-trading have had their closures reduced to a suspension, with a duration fitting the severity the win-trading they participated in, and beginning on May 1st (the date we applied the initial closures). For some extremely minor offenses, that duration was short enough that it has already been lifted. Affected players should have received an email that indicates the corrected action.<br />
<br />
We also discovered a small number of players whose accounts had been closed but had not engaged in any win-trading at all. We are deeply sorry to have punished those players incorrectly, and in addition to overturning their account closures, we have issued them with 30 days of additional game time as an apology.<br />
<br />
We’d like to make it clear that we have fully identified the error that caused this issue to occur, and can be confident in saying that future actions do not make the same mistake. That said, we’d also like to remind players that win-trading in order to earn things like Honor, Artifact Power, or Achievements is still win-trading, and is subject to the same punishments as win-trading in order to gain rating.<br />
<br />
Again, we apologize for the inaccuracies of our original actions. While we remain committed to upholding the integrity of rated play, we will take more care to ensure that the correct actions are taken in the future.<br />
<br />

FEEDBACK: Tomb Raid Finder Wing 2<br />
Tomb of Sargeras is now open for testing Raid Finder difficulty. Specifically, the second wing (Wailing Halls) is now available on the PTR. We expect to keep the wing open for the entire weekend.<br />
<br />
Please use this thread for feedback and bug reports regarding the second wing encounters, or related issues. Noting the nature of your group (Mythic guild premade, PUG, etc.) is helpful, as are any logs.<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone helps test!<br />

Check the PTR. Some changes are not noted</div></div><hr />

I check Earthshrine and SE&amp;L. All beg for changes there - bad tier set bonus, too much damage hidden behind Static Overload (RNG), loooong forgotten talents, etc. There are no changes besides an useless buff to Earth Elemental.</div></div><hr />

Don't they pretty much say something like that every time? They always get false positives in these waves, so how can they be sure it won't happen again? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
because the issue that caused this particular situation has been identified so they won't have this particular problem happen again, obviously that doesn't mean they won't have other problems down the road just not this particular scenario whatever it may have been.</div></div><hr />

Guessing these are PvP specific? Would be great if they applied for PvE as well.</div></div><hr />

Don't pretend they aren't ridiculously brokenly over-powered compared to every other tank, Frenzied Regeneration is one big reason behind that, healing them for ridiculous amounts with no cap even though it's not even one of their major cool-downs yet it sure acts like it.</div></div><hr />

Yep... Just a coincidence that bear druids have over twice the parses on mythic Gul'dan than all other tanks combined, huh? How would those poor bears ever survive a couple of nerfs? :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Alas, my body shape is not one that is conducive to making a demon hunter cosplay look good. I wonder if Blizzard is trying to get the creative folk re-engaged with doing WoW-related projects.

Don't be silly. You know as well as I that they could halve FR and Thrash power and Guardian would still be stronger than other tanks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Appparently you're clueless, just like the majority of the people whining about Guardian Druids. Yes we're the strongest tank, but MoU removal will address that a little bit (yes, we'll most likely still be best after 7.2.5). That's purely survival though, there's multiple tanks who do better DPS in raids. Guardian Druids only have competitive DPS on weird AoE fights like Spellblade, and naturally m+. We're insane in m+ but it's not like other tanks lack DPS either. The only true losers in the tank DPS race are the DH and DK, that's it.</div></div><hr />
