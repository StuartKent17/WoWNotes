Blue Posts<br />
The Azerite system totally encourages that, though. Unless you are a player that does not care about the traits other than the ones you have on it is in your best interest to hold on to gear with different traits, especially when balance changes happen.<br />
I care about the traits but if a hotfix makes what I have worse and something I tossed better AND it’s not just a tiny difference then I’ll just restore that item. This has only happened a couple of times over many years of playing. I also have bank space and often pile up things I feel are important until I sort through them and then do a mass bank-space-cleansing.<br />
<br />
A lot of changes just come with patches though and that likely means new gear, new sources, and higher level stuff so unless it’s a huge deal I’ll just get the new stuff.<br />
<br />
I can see what you are saying that you feel there is more pressure to keep the gear but I don’t feel it’s too different from the past. If I was aiming to min-max in all situations then I’d expect to be hanging on to more gear but as I mentioned earlier if there is only a small to tiny percentage difference then I stick with one and clear up the space. Do you keep gear even if it’s a .1% difference? Where is the breaking point for your play style? With the current 30 slot bags that are available, how much empty space do you tend to have?<br />
<br />
And something that isn’t directed at you Xoja but some others seem to just be asking for why we are okay with needing multiple pieces per slot at all and creating ‘clutter’. This is my personal stance, but I’d say it feels like just a part of an MMO in that some items are better than others. If we were to simplify it we could just remove stats and have items that are ‘average’, ‘good’, or ‘best’. If the item is ‘best’ it’s the best, period. Then that item can degrade to ‘good’ when a new ‘best’ is available from new content. This would cover the bag clutter and simplify things but I don’t think it’d feel fun.<br />
<br />
It’s ok to have some items to be better than others, but it’s not ok to bind item to specific spec, especially when those slots were usable for all specs for many years before BFA. This is the problem Blizzard refuses to accept and fix.<br />
How would you treat a piece of gear that has like heavy crit and is far and away the best for one spec and definitely the worst for another?<br />
<br />
It still gives you some benefit, even if it’s smaller, unlike many azerite traits that only work for one spec, and give nothing to other. If traits were switching with spec, that would be non issue…<br />
Azerite gear still comes some benefit even if 1 trait isn’t active.<br />
<br />
Juggling three secondary stats is way different than juggling dozens of azerite traits.<br />
So at a base level you feel the system is just too complicated and it would better to simplify it?<br />
<br />
Anyone would, because the reforge cost really is outrageous. My question is more: Why do you have a reforge system you don’t want people to use?<br />
Sometimes you make a mistake. Sometimes a piece drops that is great for one spec and you can respec something you have to work for another. Have you run into these situations at all? Or something else?<br />
<br />
I’m allowed to wonder why the reforge cost is so high, though.<br />
It does get high if you are changing a lot for sure. The highest amount I ever paid was like 20 gold I think? Usually it’s at the 5g amount though. Does that feel high or am I missing something here?<br />
<br />
The fact that you have to go to third party sites or use simc to figure out what trait is better isn’t complex enough for you?<br />
I feel like that’s going off the path a bit. I have been doing that for a long time due to trinkets, comparing set bonuses to item level, and deciding the value of secondary stats for each spec. How is this different for you now? (Source (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1104303-blizz-stop-punishing-players-who-have-dual-roles/))<br />

No Shared Rewards Across Classic and Retail WoW<br />
Mounts and companions you get in classic SHOULD NOT be usable across multiple characters on the same classic account, however, you should be able to have these rewards in retail. This will increase the longevity of classic.<br />
Like it was stated at BlizzCon there will be no crossover in rewards between Retail WoW and Classic WoW. I don’t think there is any need to change that stance but I appreciate the post OP.<br />
<br />
I think its fair to ask for an opportunity to earn those rewards again however I don’t think it should come at the cost of diminishing the rewards that players earned years ago and cherish. I think the opportunity to earn and have them exclusively on Classic is fair because its staying on Classic itself. I think any more crossover than that could be damaging and lessen the value or prestige of those rewards.<br />
<br />
It’s a pretty solid philosophy at the moment that there will be zero crossover of rewards. (Source (https://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1104312-please-reconsider-your-stance-on-retail-classic-reward-linking/))<br />

Doesn't really seem fair, though, since it's a big &quot;fuck you&quot; to anyone who didn't play in Legion and take advantage of something that should never have been.<br />
<br />
But that's okay, though, since if you have a life I'm sure you can afford to toss Blizz some real money for a token to sell, to get yourself some in-game gold.</div></div><hr />

This is the massive contradiction:<br />
<br />
Blizzard fantasy land: We don't want you to have to sim all the time.<br />
Reality: traits are stupidly ambiguous so simming only real way to know what is an actual upgrade/better<br />
<br />
Blizzard fantasy land: gold cost justified in reforging so you're not doing it all the time and traits feel semi-permanent for specs<br />
Reality: traits are stupidly ambiguous so simming only real way to avoid spending thousands and thousands of gold in testing traits in game<br />

<br />
What a shit response to give. I play once a week and almost never have to change my gear around so is 5g a lot of money? What a way to show how much value you put in your player base when you respond to them with such underhanded comments. The system punishes experimentation, punishes players wanting to play multiple specs in a pve and pvp environments. To think that players would only ever pick one set of traits for all content and maybe reforge once in a blue moon is ridiculous and is completely counter intuitive to having spec specific traits, aoe vs single target traits, raid vs mythic+ traits, PvP vs PvE traits. There is so much variety in content and players will always look to experiment with and find ways to perform the best they can in each of those situations, and as a result they have to change traits around but are punished for doing so. It doesn't take a lot to see that, but it really demonstrates how out of touch these devs are with players.</div></div><hr />

They are all forced to defend something the entire player base hates and they barely have any arguments so it's expected for them to sound like pricks. I am sure they agree with the players but literally are not allowed to agree.</div></div><hr />

The ramping respec cost is rather silly but new players not having gold isn’t really an argument when it’s so laughably easy to get. Just from running a few cata/mop raids one shooting every thing and some battle grounds giving 60-80 gold each one gone from 600 to 17k in a week.</div></div><hr />

They have not learned from the mistakes and problems of the past. if something is tied to your spec, it should follow when you change that spec. Glyphs, Talents, etc etc, this was a novel thing back in 2009, and made life for people who tanked or healed so much better. But 10 years down the road they reverted to the old system which made you respec. Now for the most part it isn't an issue, if I need to switch the spec on the fly, I'm not respecing azerite gear. But if your a Tank in your Mythic Raid, and pushing high keys as a DPS, The cost adds up quickly. You want to be min maxed for those situations. While I think the Reforging them like talents is a good idea, I think like talents they should change from spec to spec.</div></div><hr />

I only used websites like Ask Mr. Robot and Simbot in the past if I got a piece of gear that looked to be an actual upgrade. But with Battle for Azeroth, I've actually had to download Simulationcraft and rely much more on Simbot simply because of how bad the Azerite system is.

and ? 99% of playerbase dont play like this. If it's about &quot;carrent playerbase&quot; than don't know, it could be, may be. But I couldn't name any of my friends whom I could include in these 99% back then, if to make discount on &quot;tolerance&quot;, so let it be 50%, but in fact there were not so many as you think. Yes, not everyone did it well, but they made attempts to understand, mash the brain at least. We aren't even talking about this, but about the whole system (classes(mechanics)+talents+stats/characteristics+tuning=RPG (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20768536863#post-14)), it was much less complicated before, easier to analyze and understand than now. Naturally, yes, you don't need (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2425966-Azerite-System-is-a-failure?p=50051757&amp;viewfull=1#post50051757) to understand it to play now, but if (http://www.darklegacycomics.com/comics/646.jpg) you suddenly will want (https://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17624523567#post-9), it'll probably take more time... and for what? Most of dependencies and information are not even tied to your character, but lying around somewhere in the mud (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2427604-Glyph-system-vs-Azerite-gear?p=50074135&amp;viewfull=1#post50074135) (PvP talents, Azerite armor, etc. (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2413443-PvP-depth-okay-PvE-depth-not-okay?p=49780724&amp;viewfull=1#post49780724)) tightly adhered to it and not accessible to you. Therefore, as one of the most lazy, but curious (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769766860?page=12#post-236) people, I would gladly change carrent system (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769060102?page=1#post-1) to old one (https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20769766860) at any time (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2437361-Reddit-Post-quot-why-making-azerite-traits-quot-better-quot-isn-t-enough-quot).</div></div><hr />

Everything they are doing is copying a private server. Why pay to play when it's free elsewhere with less effort involved? And add on top of BfA stupidity. None are going to keep a sub to play classic when they keep spitting int he face of people playing BfA. WoW is taking a massive dive and it just doesn't stop.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I'm pretty sure Ion drew these avatars himself instead of working on the game</div></div><hr />

So correct me if I'm mistaken.... but your interested in WoW classic has been killed because you aren't going to be able to use Classic Mounts/Rewards/Titles/Achievements across your account? Why on earth would you feel entitled to have these rewards across your account in the first place? Those rewards/achievements are for those players who actually played during Classic and should remain as their accomplishments. Allowing players to share Classic rewards with Retail is not only absurd, but completely insulting to all the players who earned those rewards.</div></div><hr />
