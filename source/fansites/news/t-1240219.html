Patch 5.2 - Reputation, Lesser Charm, and Pet Battle Changes<br />
I really don't want to do dailies every day.<br />
I guess you might like this... The developers are currently planning to include bonus reputation that can be earned via scenarios and dungeons. It doesn't necessarily mean it'll be through tabards and in the exact same way as back in the days, but sounds close enough to what you want!<br />
<br />
I really don't want to do dailies for coins either, why can't we just get them from HC's as well?<br />
Actually, not from heroics, but the developers are planning to let you have a chance to earn Lesser Charms of Good Fortune (http://www.wowdb.com/currencies/738-lesser-charm-of-good-fortune) through Pet Battles. Basically, if you win, you'll have a chance of receiving charms based on your pet level. <br />
<br />
And if a player is below level 90, they'll get experience equal to defeating a yellow creature. <br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.2 - New World Boss<br />
Previously the developers have mentioned that they learned a lot from the new Mists of Pandaria world bosses and would add more in a future patch. It seems we may see a new one in Patch 5.2!<br />

Item Upgrades and Item Level<br />
Items that have been upgraded do count and contribute towards increasing your character's overall average item level. However, keep in mind that with 15-16 item slots; increasing a single item's level by +4/8 may not be sufficient to make an immediate impact. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248660-item-upgrades/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7415602280?page=1#12))<br />
<br />
WoW Graphics<br />
Bad technical graphics just means fewer pixels, fewer polygons, fewer details, fewer decals, shorter draw distance, etc.<br />
<br />
Maybe I didn't express myself very clearly. Here's the full quote:<br />
Also, bad graphics is very subjective, if you mean it in technical terms, everything will always end up having bad graphics, it’s only a matter of time. If you mean the art itself is bad, then that’s a valuable opinion, but opinions are highly subjective, and I have to say I strongly disagree.<br />
<br />
What I meant to say is that in technical terms, it's simply a matter of time until any kind of graphics is considered bad/out dated. But graphics as in the “artwork” is something quite different; it has an intrinsic value that doesn’t degrade over time. That's why lots of people still play Mario, Puzzle Bobble, Pac-Man... and they still love the artwork and gameplay. <br />
<br />
Lately it seems that quite a lot of games tend to be all about who has the biggest textures and latest shaders, that's an illusion that usually manages to hide the lack of innovation and real gameplay value. <br />
<br />
Now, of course, graphics are also important and that's why we upgrade our engine from time to time, especially if it will make it more efficient and give players a better performance, but I'd still like to think that what players value the most is the gameplay, originality and innovation. <br />
<br />
There is also an issue with changing something that is considered classic, and in my opinion, WoW verges on that. A lot of players would dislike major changes to the artwork, so when we upgrade our graphics engine, we need to be careful to make sure it doesn’t change the classic visuals that much. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248580-graphics-in-wow/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3161499975?page=4#64))<br />
<br />
New Character Models<br />
Actually... the development team is working on new character models for the vanilla races. Unfortunately, we don't have an estimate yet on when they'll be available. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/248607-new-race-models/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6160897264?page=1#9))<br />
<br />
Taste for Blood Nerf<br />
No one likes to see nerfs being done to their class, unfortunately it’s one of those things that a game like WoW is always subject to, and there are just too many variables, limited resources and schedules to keep.<br />
So sometimes we have to hotfix stuff, the problem is that players will always get used to the “overpowered” abilities, and when the nerf comes the disappointment is inevitable.<br />
<br />
As you can imagine this is definitely not in our interest, we want our players to have fun; this is a game after all.<br />
<br />
The problem is that when someone is “having fun” due to having an overpowered ability or class/spec, that usually comes at the cost of someone else feeling miserable when they realize that there’s nothing that they can do to counter such class/spec/ability.<br />
<br />
So ideally we would like to have a perfectly balanced game without having to hotfix anything at all, this way no one would have to miss being overpowered and then feel mad after being nerfed, there would also be no need for anyone to ever feel underpowered as well. Sadly this is too idealistic, but it’s a noble goal that we always like to have in the back of our minds when we design our games.<br />
<br />
Let’s get to the point, Taste for Blood wasn’t overpowered in itself, yes it hit very hard, but like you said, Chaos Bolt hits very hard as well, so why the nerf? Well TfB is tied to Heroic Strike and that makes it particularly dangerous because it’s out of the CGD.<br />
<br />
If you’re casting a Chaos Bolt you can be interrupted, you have to stand still, you can lose LoS and it has a somewhat long casting time.<br />
<br />
Now if you’re a warrior and the stars align, you can have 5 stacks of TfB, Mortal Strike + Heroic Strike + Auto Attack + mastery proc all in the very same instant, that can literally be a 1-shot and that is something that we don’t want to see happening in PvP, it’s just not acceptable. <br />
<br />
Taking out 50% of HP from someone can be ok as long as you can’t take 50% of HP followed by an equivalent powerful attack from the same source, the enemy needs to have enough time to land a heal or recover is some other way before you take the rest of his HP, this is where skill comes in, if you’re able to stop that player from recovering during that time, then well played!<br />
<br />
I’m not saying that PvP is perfectly tuned right now, I’m sure that we will have more hotfixes coming in the near future, devs are constantly analysing data and listening to your feedback and they will keep trying to bring the game closer to a state of perfect balance as best and as fast as they possibly can.<br />
<br />
If Taste for Blood capping at 1 stack proves to be an excessively strong nerf, you can be sure that devs will catch it when they analyse fresh new data, if that happens they can always change TfB again directly or make up for the nerf in some other way, like buffing some other ability or indirectly by bringing the other classes that might be too powerful to the same level as the warrior. In the end the goal is simply balance, and there is an infinite number of ways to get there.<br />
<br />
I guess my question is, why do developers say they're content with something and defend their decision not to change it, then suddenly find it 'unacceptable' and change it?<br />
There’s a saying in my country that says “only fools never change their minds”.<br />
<br />
Developers are not machines, they do their very best at trying to design the game as balanced as possible, it’s true that some opinions can be very strong sometimes, but the values that are initially attributed to constants and variables in the formulas for most abilities are not simply made up on the spot, there’s extensive math involved there and sometimes it’s only natural that one can trust the math a bit too strongly, the problem is that sometimes math doesn’t directly translate to a live gaming environment, so an ability/spell can look absolutely perfect on paper and in a simulation but still end up being horribly tuned for certain PvP situations because simulating 11 classes, 34 specs, talents, glyphs, and human behaviour all at the same time is never easy.<br />
<br />
This game is incredibly vast and we need a lot of resources, proper data, and a good amount of samples to be able to really check out all the facts, constant data analysis and listening to reliable feedback can have a tremendous effect in catalysing and accelerating changes being applied to the game because it can point devs in the right direction, thus saving our most precious asset, time.<br />
<br />
If you look at the rate of constant hotfixes and patches that we release, you can’t really say that devs are stubborn, if anything, WoW must be one of the most iterated games of all time, it’s in a permanent state of change, constantly adapting to the needs and requirements of the present time, that means that devs are quite open minded and are always ready to listen to facts and the opinions of others, also remember that most of them are also players so they have the same experience that you do, they want to make this game the best that it can possibly be, both as players and as developers, and that’s a tough combination to beat if you ask me. <br />
<br />
Almost no one can have a grasp over everything in WoW, it’s simply that vast. This game is a beast.<br />
<br />
If we ever appear to be locked into some fixed idea it’s because there must be a very strong reason for it, and also because applying changes always takes time, quality control is particularly important, we want to avoid applying changes and then going back and forth regretting about them later on, so time for proper testing is extremely important for assuring reliability.

EU Battle.net Authenticators Temporarily Unavailable<br />
From December 17 2012, physical products including Battle.net Authenticators will be temporarily unavailable on the Blizzard Online Store in Europe (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/index.xml). This is in preparation for a revamp of the store which will take place during 2013. In the meantime, many items can be found on the US Blizzard Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/index.xml). <br />
<br />
Players wishing to acquire a Battle.net Authenticator have several options. The Battle.net Mobile Authenticator is available for many types of smartphone, and you can find out more about it here (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/battle-net-mobile-authenticator-faq). For many people, this is the easiest and cheapest option!<br />
<br />
If you prefer to have a physical Battle.net Authenticator, you can get hold of one from several sources including the online retailers and high-street stores listed here (https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/battlenet-authenticator-orders).<br />

Heroic Amber-Shaper Un'sok Burn Strategy<br />
Manaflask pointed out (http://www.manaflask.com/en/article/2143/70-to-0-in-18-seconds-on-amber-shaper-un-039-sok-10h) a clever strategy used by Check Please (http://checkplease.enjin.com/home) to kill Amber-Shaper Un'sok (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/62511-amber-shaper-unsok). It is likely this is not intended and will be fixed soon if it isn't already. <br />
<br />
They spent a lot of time in Phase 1 having the Mutated Construct (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/62701-mutated-construct) cast Amber Strike (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122389-amber-strike) to apply the Destabilize (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/123059-destabilize) debuff. This is apparently allowed to stack up to 255 times, greatly increasing the amount of damage the boss takes. <br />
<br />
During the short period of time at the start of Phase 2 before the Amber Monstrosity (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/62711-amber-monstrosity) arrives and shields the boss with Amber Carapace (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/122540-amber-carapace), you can do a very high amount of damage and kill the boss, skipping the rest of the fight. <br />

<br />
Oh, and Chris is just narrow sighted, as most people are who think that A) World PvP was always about ganking (It wasn't) B) People will rush to help you get back at the ganker(s) (They won't) C) You have a character as strong/stronger than the ganker (Not always)... oh and D) You're on a PvP server not because you enjoy world PvP, but because one faction heavily outweighs the other, and CRZ pretty much negated that (Guilty).<br />
<br />
Considering most people who actually enjoy PvP have moved to a controlled, instanced form of PvP, ganking is really all that's left of world PvP, and that's kind of sad.<br />
<br />
Edit - OH! E) Because that's where your PvE/PvP guild of choice is. (Can't really change that too much.)</div></div><hr />

The comment about keeping wow classic, makes sense, I remember when Street Fighter II changed and went Apha, it just didn't feel like it was the same game I had fell in love with before, with the Art being so different it just felt &quot;fake&quot; to me. I'm sure if they tried to completely change Wow's look in that nature, it wouldn't feel right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The CMs seem to be trying to talk about this idea of how world PVP was before and it was with battles. For years Blizzard has tried to bring back the world PVP of Classic and they are trying world bosses and some horrible daily zones that create agitation. This dream though of bringing back what was once there is just not going to happen with CRZ alone and it feels more like world PVP was not so much the intention of CRZ to begin with and it wasnt really stated as such before the feature was even implemented. CRZ was there to populate the zones and bring them closer to what they was designed for and players shooting across low level zones looking for players to one shot and/or camp and scoot off to another zone to avoid world PVP battles when someone mounts a retaliation is just part of what happens with such a feature. Just like how LFD and LFR brings in griefers and afk who get kicked and then jump back in without consequences or long term consequences. It wasnt intended, it just comes with it.<br />
<br />
Things like flying mounts and the vastly greater differences in player power compared to that of Classic play a roll in whats going on in these lower level CRZ zones. One of the things we have today that is a remnant of PVP in Classic is the honorless debuff, it was there as a method to discourage killing the defenseless along with lower levels not rewarding honor. Thing is honor doesnt mean anything anymore and these original methods that was used to discourage such behavior and reward those for fighting those on equal footing just dont mater any more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh so that is happening. On KJ, the only time the server crashes is when someone takes multiple raids to a city. Than again world PVP at max level doesnt happen much in terms of large scale battles. I remember back in WotLK when Blizzard was asked about world bosses and one of the issues the CM or Dev said at the time was servers being able to handle them and the issues they encountered with Wintergrasp. Possibly most of the world PVP battles going on KJ is when alliance decide to kill that 40 man multi boxer who doesnt really end up doing anything meaningful as they usually have a dominance over most areas they go to due to their size which means the alliance just move off to another zone. The last time they did something useful was defending other hord with world bosses and now they dont even do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im gonna assume that your talking about Galleon, in his case Blizzard has already stated they learned a lot from him not only is he zergable but he spawns in a already crowded zone.<br />
<br />
I expect the next world boss wont be in a heavy zone or zergable and you wont be able to use the current tag mechanic which leads to more crowding in a single location. <br />
<br />
They also said the next world boss may have chance to spawn in multiple locations instead of one.</div></div><hr />

The comment about keeping wow classic, makes sense, I remember when Street Fighter II changed and went Apha, it just didn't feel like it was the same game I had fell in love with before, with the Art being so different it just felt &quot;fake&quot; to me. I'm sure if they tried to completely change Wow's look in that nature, it wouldn't feel right.<br />
<br />
Eh, you expect a game prequel that came out in 1995 retain the same sprites and animation from a game form 1991? Not too mention Alpha used the CSP2 board which automatically meant that the Alpha series of games would get an upgrade in animation and sprites. Sides, Alpha 2-3 were fucking awesome games and controlled extremely tight at the time.<br />
<br />
And yes, WoW's character models badly need an update as they're about on par with late N64/early Dreamcast models from 1999. Pretty sad IMO.</div></div><hr />

Reputation is for optional items, lesser charms is for extra rolls. You want this? You do the optional dailies. Don't want to do the dailies? Don't bother then. Don't act like you are entitled to elder charms just for doing content you'd be doing anyway.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hey Daily Blink you morons, it looks like you started playing WOW in late WOTLK/CATA.<br />
Au contraire: it seems you never experienced the gankfests in vanilla. Anyone who claims there was little ganking in vanilla is plain lying. The difference? Seems guilds were more social then since people DID help each other out. People that didn't like it? They chose a frikkin' PVE server, and guess what? PVE servers turn out to be great for people who only like instanced PVP.</div></div><hr />

You missed my point. What im saying is that gankers griefs. <br />
<br />
Vanilla had:<br />
<br />
Lvl 60 mounts that no griefer could afford.<br />
<br />
3 sec cast time.<br />
<br />
No flying mounts.<br />
<br />
No realm phasing abuse.<br />
<br />
And: Newbies that had the mentally of &quot;when i get to 60 ill get a 100% mount and i will have my revenge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now it is:<br />
<br />
&quot;When i hit 90 what can i do? Because they just fly and avoid any equal pvp combat, i quit.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's bull. Even with a land mount, if a Ganker wants to escape you he will escape you.<br />
<br />
Besides: Most complaints are about bored lv 90s farming lv 60s. Ground mount or fly mount won't make a difference there.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;When i hit 90 what can i do? Because they just fly and avoid any equal pvp combat, i quit.&quot;<br />
<br />
Once Lv 90, the ganking problem effectively solved itself. Sure you will be killed a few times while daily questing, but that's to be expected.</div></div><hr />

Elder charms are only optional in the sense that gems and enchants are optional. Sure, you can clear raids without them. But if you do, you're holding back your raid and being a scumbag.<br />

Still sounds like your on the wrong server.

That's a weird comparison. You don't need to do anything special to get gems/enchants, except paying for it at the auction house, and they give you a great advantage in raids.<br />
Elder charms give you no advantage, except you get a re-roll in certain situations, wich is a nice gimmick but in no way required for normal/heroic raiding (being called a &quot;scumbag&quot; for not having elder charms? What universe are you from?). In order to get those charms you will be doing dailies all week. See what happens there? Optional rewards for doing optional content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's up to the individual raidteams if they want to require their raiders to farm charms, cap valor, get all crafted gear, farm pvp items if they are upgrades, etc..<br />
Outside of such things, there is always going to be a difference in effort between raiders of the same team, be it in preparation for fights, chipping in when discussing tactics, not everyone make an equal contribution.<br />
If you are at the point where you think your fellow raider is a scumbag for not doing EVERYTHING he can to improve, then make sure you are in a guild that requires such of its raiders :)</div></div><hr />

Quick, someone translate... Actually... the development team is working on new character models for the vanilla races. Unfortunately, we don't have an estimate yet on when they'll be available ...into English for this man!<br />
<br />
Spoilers: It took over 4 years for Valve to develop and finalize the highly iconic designs and highly optimized models for their Team Fortress 2 units. Why on earth would Blizzard -- which has a really strict house style -- take any less time trying to update the long-accepted and extremely familiar existing player models to a high enough standard that warrant such an upgrade?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard never promised the models would be there at a certain date. Pre-MoP they even explicitely stated that they yet have to decide when to START working on the new models,even though they did some promising work on the dwarven.</div></div><hr />

World PvP = fine and fair. <br />
Ganking = pathetic. <br />
Ganking and camping low level towns and repeatedly killing all quest givers and flight masters = griefing.<br />
Ganking and camping low level towns and repeatedly killing all quest givers and flight masters = griefing?<br />
<br />
In Vanilla and all the way through Burning crusade, that was usually called a challenge. A taunting motion for the opposing faction to bring their goons and thugs to put a smackdown on the gankers. But since people are extremely lazy nowadays, since they play for rewards and not for laughs and great moments, no one rises up and stomps the ganker in the face. Instead we bitch and moan.<br />
This is how some of the greatest World pvp battles of all time started, and now it's called griefing just because people are lazy to retaliate?<br />
<br />
Interesting how time changes a game and it's playerbase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Vanilla and all the way through Burning crusade, that was usually called a challenge. A taunting motion for the opposing faction to bring their goons and thugs to put a smackdown on the gankers. But since people are extremely lazy nowadays, since they play for rewards and not for laughs and great moments, no one rises up and stomps the ganker in the face. Instead we bitch and moan.<br />
This is how some of the greatest World pvp battles of all time started, and now it's called griefing just because people are lazy to retaliate?<br />
<br />
Interesting how time changes a game and it's playerbase.<br />
<br />
By Blizzards own definition it is griefing, it is just acceptable in most cases on a PVP realm. For the most part yes the players are too lazy to retaliate and when they do attempt to retaliate the &quot;red = dead&quot; crowd fly off on their mounts avoiding a confrontation which makes it a waste of time for those who went to join in some world PVP battles. These greatest of world pvp battles took place many years ago and despite the many expansions that Blizzard tried to bring them back it just is not going to be like it once was. <br />
<br />
From my own experience, most of those who would jump in to engage in world PVP battles was due to being bored. Someone starts ganking in SS or TM and then someone hits the city calling for a raid and bored players jump up and go OMG action. With all the dailies, rare spawns, and world bosses, Blizzard is successful in getting more players out in the world and that is good for world PVP in Pandaria. Getting players to go back to a city with portals and then fly out to a potential battle zone outside of Pandaria is for the most part not worth the time when there are far more rewarding things to do. More players also have alts now and they can jump on those to be productive.<br />
<br />
So maybe it is not that the players are lazy, it is just that they dont care and have better things to do than to chase after a griefer that flies away at the sight of a challenge.</div></div><hr />

Reputation is for optional items, lesser charms is for extra rolls. You want this? You do the optional dailies. Don't want to do the dailies? Don't bother then. Don't act like you are entitled to elder charms just for doing content you'd be doing anyway.<br />
<br />
whats wrong with options i hate dailies now but i still want charms, with this change i can stop doing dailies once i hit the necessary rep point to unlock the gear ( if there is a new faction in 5.2) after that i can level my pets while collecting the charms<br />

Again, PVP realms isn't about fairness. It's about everything being allowed.<br />

And for the record, yes, I have been ganked many times. It's inevitable when you're on the underdog faction on a PVP server. But you know what? Suck it up, get some PVP gear, and gank the hell back so they get a taste of their own medicine.</div></div><hr />

It really does make you think that instead of adapting to the new needs of the playerbase, or indeed actually steering them, Blizzard have just slapped on CRZ in the hopes of bringing back the glory days of vanilla without acknowledging the fact the game has changed to point where World PvP= ganking, and Blizzard are the biggest culprits in this change. Even in WotLK when everyone was sitting in Dalaran hitting their button for insta queue instance ports Hillsbrad and STV and other places could see some intra-guild battles erupting, albeit rarely compared to vanilla standards and then the Cataclysm happens to segregate both factions in such a way that a levelling character could conceivably reach Hellfire Pen without even seeing a member of the opposite faction. You can't change the game in one direction and then hope that people will be happy when you half assedly change your mind back. Even in Panderia, with all their liittle tweaks made by Blizz to promote World PvP shows a lack of real understanding of the current mood of the playerbase as I think I've seen World PvP (Halfhill excepting) all of three times in Panderia since MoP was released; people just want their dailys done and then they want to GTFO. Hell, instead of World PvP I think MoP has brung an unprecedented level of co-operation between players of the opposite factions. World PvP was a thing, but it's day is long done. I wish Blizz would let it die gracefully instead of changing the game because of a rose tinted memories of a bygone age and the The Daily Blink unusually misses the mark on this issue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are not forced to do a single thing. It is for people who like to pet battle and would rather do that than run dailies for lesser charms. But if you went out and got exalted with all of the major factions then you shouldn't need to run any dailies at all for the next 3 months. My druid has over 1000 lesser charms. The only dailies I run on him now are Tiller. At the rate I'm going it's going to take me about 9 months to run out of lesser charms.<br />
<br />
On my priest I am going to reach my limit in about 2 months, at which point I'll have a choice on what I want to do to replenish my charms. Before I was dreading running dailies on factions that I don't need. You see my priest is Holy/Disc and doing dailies is a pain in the ass sometimes. But now with these changes I'll have the option to do pet battles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then you didn't understand the complaints about the rep gain options this time. Either that or you're one of those people that want to make the game tedious enough to make those who you don't want to be playing the game quit. Either way, it's a fail argument because it's not the argument.<br />
<br />
Aside from the gating of two factions and crafting patterns that could be pretty damn important to guilds and raiders (making them seem like they were necessary anyway even though Blizz had the intentions otherwise), it's the thing that we were pigeon holed into dailies if we wanted to grind rep. No one was ever saying &quot;bring back tabards&quot; (though, again, those playing the pathetic elitist vs. casual war the way they do will try to say that that's what is being said anyway because they have a nasty ulterior motive with wanting things to stay the way they are now).<br />
<br />
However, when you put things in that players see as necessary (like high end enchants and crafting patterns) behind factions that are gated behind another faction that takes weeks to grind to the appropriate level and whose dailies are so tediously boring and take you to a ridiculously cramped and heavily contested spot on the map to do them, and then you take away all other avenues to get the rep (even those that were acceptable in TBC, which is viewed by elitists to be THE expansion), then don't think through that people might have a lot of alts that they want to take to 90 as well, and you create a problem that has no easy solution. <br />
<br />
Plus, no one bought that Blizz was doing that for the reasons Blizz gave. They had a faction that they wanted to shove down our throats because they thought it was the best story line they ever did. The Golden Lotus and Klaxxi had backlash because there were just too many dailies, the places to do them in were way too crowded and cramped, the mobs were pretty tough to kill, the dailies themselves were just boring to have to do, and the rep gains from each one didn't justify the work you put into doing them. The Shado Pan, Tillers, and AC ones were much better, I think, because they didn't take as long to do, they didn't provide you with an endless daily quest line that at the end of it didn't make you wonder if you even made a dent in your rep gains, the dailies were more interesting (I like when the AC takes me to the White Temple, for example), and it wasn't as cramped or tougher than it had to be (I like a challenge, too, but I want the difficulty to make sense).<br />
<br />
And to be honest, this upcoming change IS giving us what they did in TBC (think Thrallmar rep), which is what they should've done to begin with. It gives us another avenue for those that would like to get the rep and wouldn't mind doing the grinds to do them (nor minds the wait), but are groaning at how they mismanaged their obsession with the dailies.</div></div><hr />

True, but you cant take 4months+ on LIVE to fix important problems. There needs to be a middle ground. Feedback about dailies going to be a problem was given in Beta, even when it wasnt such a big problem because in Beta there were no VP gear attached to them.<br />
<br />
It took too long to acknowledge the problems in cata, it took to long to do so in MoP IMO too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This happened frequently on Live as well. It hasn't happened to me personally recently, but when CRZ first dropped, it was pretty frequent. Blizzard may have stated it, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen frequently. Any CRZ problems are usually buried, if you search the forums, you'll still find several posts where they claim to have fixed the pvp on pve problems, they do seem to have got it now at least.</div></div><hr />

See?Mine is better and it seems more people have more options this way. You don't want people have options?Does more options confuse you?something else?please explain</div></div><hr />

It hasn't happened to me personally recently, but when CRZ first dropped, it was pretty frequent. Blizzard may have stated it, but that doesn't mean it didn't happen frequently. Any CRZ problems are usually buried, if you search the forums, you'll still find several posts where they claim to have fixed the pvp on pve problems, they do seem to have got it now at least.<br />
<br />
They fixed it 3 months ago, yet people continue to believe otherwise since it's an excellent excuse to bash on Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

It's so easy to escape the gankers...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Agreed. Pretty useless friends/guild right there.<br />
<br />
Yeah create a huge world, with tons of zones and things to see. Yet force people to stay in cities chain running things just to avoid mongoloids who gank.<br />
Top notch reasoning right there<br />

PvP ganking : cry more, you rolled on a PVP server, live with it. you have more options than you think :<br />
<br />
1- level your toon on another server and transfer it at 90<br />
2-level with dungeons /bg's<br />
3- CRY LIKE A GODDAMN , STUPID BABY.<br />
<br />
1.Yes nice way for blizz to cash in some easy money. <br />
2.Why create a huge world if you want people to chain run dungeons/bgs? Think before you write plz<br />
3. Right just live with mongos you gank all day because they can't break 1.2k rating. &quot;crying&quot; about it might bring change to this</div></div><hr />

Tough break. Blizzard fixed the world population. It's not their fault you thought they would never fix the game. Deal with it and stop complaining about it. The stuff you're asking for is readily available already. On PVE servers. Don't freaking ruin PVP servers for the rest of us who knew what we were getting into.</div></div><hr />

Ganker detected. Serious pvpvers don't spend their time killing lowbies. If you joined a pvp server just to kill people who are low levelled you should reconsider the reasons why you even play.<br />
How about you go slay low level mobs so you can do it 24/7</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right... we're going to be banned for doing exactly what the encounter allows. We used no outside items or scripts or anything of the sort. We simply didn't dps the boss, stacked the debuff, timed it properly and popped all cooldowns to kill him. If they don't want people to kill it like this, they will simply change the fight. We won't be punished at all.</div></div><hr />

I'm on the faction that's outnumbered 2:1 on my server, have been for 3½ years. And you know how I've dealt with it? By always having a set of PVP gear equipped out in the world, instead of wasting my time whining on a forum about how it's unfair that my server doesn't have rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also a lot of the &quot;bleeding edge&quot; guilds used some variation of this strategy, so I don't understand the shock from the player base. It was even easier when Combust was bugged and did 100x damage on the Monstrosity. It's why you weren't seeing kill videos of it even when guilds were releasing stuff like Heroic Empress and Tsulong vids. Amber-Shaper wasn't the only boss cheesed this tier either. Look at how guilds used the 4pc DS bonus on Tsulong, or Ring of Frost on Will. No action was taken.<br />
<br />
So yeah, don't want to go into some big rant, but I hope this post helps everyone see the big picture. Several bosses this tier were killed in fashions such as this, instead of doing what was intended. When you have a 16 boss tier, some bosses will slip through the cracks. If I recall correctly, guilds weren't banned for the Atremedes door strat either.</div></div><hr />

Like was posted on page 1, there's going to be another rarer competitive boss that spawns in a more remote location too<br />

Make it harder and spawn less frequently than the Sha, but more frequent spawn than Galleon. Also I feel that they're going to update at least's Sha's loot table.</div></div><hr />

People like you don't seem to care about there being an underlining problem with the whole &quot;you understood the risks going in&quot; thing.<br />
<br />
They did, but so did you!<br />
<br />
Think about it. The people that are doing the constant ganking: what are THEY risking right now? What are THEY putting on the line by griefing lowbies? They can fly away, they can easily be in a spot where no 90+ guards are going to even see them do what they do, the ganked are never going to be able to get anyone to care to help him or her out with them, and there is no real penalty outside of the no honor gained aspect, and the gankers couldn't care less about if they get honor or not by ganking continuously.<br />
<br />
Problem is that you're telling the ganked to deal with it and that they should deal with the risks, but risk needs to be a two way street. There's no challenge or risk for the gankers, which lies the problem that has to be addressed, and it cannot be addressed as long as it:<br />
<br />
1. Gets completely ignored.<br />
2. Gankers whine when there is a higher risk thought up from them doing what they do.<br />
3. People tell griefed to &quot;deal with it&quot; while thinking that the griefers should be allowed to do whatever the fuck they want without any sort of consequence or risk to them.<br />
<br />
Just because the griefed knew the risks going in doesn't mean that the griefers should be allowed to sleep like babies on that bed they made.</div></div><hr />

I love doing group oriented crap, I would be doing it if this game wasn't such a massive cock block. That is however besides the point. If you want to get into a who needs that gear debate you'll lose because you don't need that fucking gear for your group oriented activity either. The point is that everybody to some degree or another plays world of warcraft for progression and reward. Don't tell me what I need or don't need.

When Blizzard starts offering free server transfers from pvp to pve realms then people don't have the right to bitch about pvp servers. When most of us started playing this game we were told by our friends what server they were on. When we clicked create new character there was no warning that we'd be spawn camped by people who one shot us. Had I known I would have never leveled on a pvp server and until they offer free transfers the complaints are valid. Period.</div></div><hr />

Daily quests are not more content in my point of view. Doing the same quest every day doesn't mean they have added more quests or anything. In fact dailies in general means the exact opposite, that because they lack of content they have you grind the exact same content over and over and over for a month+<br />
<br />

dungeons are optional too. You don't need to do them. The whole point here is that you can continue doing dailies and progress that way. The only thing that will change is that people that don't like dailies and prefer dungeons can also progress too the same exact way. Except if you believe that dailies are more difficult content than Heroic dungeons. I am not saying that heroic dungeons in Mop have any challenge, but at least have more than dailies.<br />
<br />
Anyway I don't understand why you are pissed off. Is that because I can get my reputation, recipes, mounts without doing the content you like most? Now imagine the opposite. Lets say that dailies reward you with 463 blue ilvl and dungeons give you reputation, recipes,mounts, and access to vendors with 476 ilvl gear. You don't like dungeons for example. Would you feel like forced to do dungeons? Would you do only dailies and then start raiding with 463 ilvl from dailies?</div></div><hr />

Ultimately everything is optional but what kind of a choice is that? I love running dungeons but after 463 their's very little reason. I'd like to be rewarded properly and sufficiently for whatever activity I do. If I want to run heroics for valor gear I should be allowed to. You can run dailies and do the exact same thing. In cataclysm everyone whined and moaned about how hard the heroic dungeons were. Well guess what. Those heroics were OPTIONAL. You could get into raids (and if it had existed at the time LFR) with simple blues from questing and normal dungeon gear. Yet nobody said heroics were optional then. What happened?</div></div><hr />

well I think we are on same boat and I misunderstood you. I thought you were against that change and you wanted reputation stay exclusive to dailies..btw I never complained about cata dungeons and they weren't hard at all...I play since vanilla and I have seen much more difficult dungeons.Even in wrath of the lich king dungeons was harder at the start but we felt was easy because everyone back knew how to play them. We all came from TBC and doing CC was very normal back then and so we felt they were easy. The problem with cata was the new philosophy of DPS pull first, aoe with no cc. That philosophy came from the last patch of wotlk when in my opinion have started the wow downfall.</div></div><hr />

I'm betting sub numbers came in and they were declining and the reason given was dailies.

Yea miscommunication. I didn't think they were very hard either but I had a good group of players who were co-ordinated. Even in LFD I got good groups all the time but I can understand the frustration of many players.<br />

Ultimately what I hope they learned is that being bored because you've done everything in the game is worse than being bored because you don't like what's being offered to you.

This is what I did. I canceled my sub and added that reason. &quot;Dailies and no alternative way for reputaion, recipes, valor gear&quot;. Funny thing is , the last time I have canceled my sub I had added the reason that we have not a feature to modify the look of our characters and we all look the same and &quot;bam&quot; I read after 2 weeks that transmogrification will be added lol...of course is coincedence but it happens two times in a row :)<br />

I'd like to see where you get a lvl 40 pvp set so he doesn't get ganked 24/7. Oh wait there is none.<br />

Why does everyone think like this? This mindset is slowly killing the game. If you don't play enough to kill the boss, then you don't get to kill it. Get over it. Everybody feels like they are entitled to do everything, leaving the dedicated players with nothing to show for the time they put in. Even heroic raiding, which was specifically designed to fix this problem, is fucked now with all of the nerfs that come out. Who DOESNT have the Deathwing heroic mount? Sure, dedicated players get cool gear for a few months, and then everything is thrown out the window when the nerfs roll in. It's retarded. Stop complaining.</div></div><hr />

I've played a few hundred hours this expansion and I have not even seen Galleon yet. On my server he dies within minute of spawning, if you don't camp for him you don't see him. Its dumb.</div></div><hr />

It's not that he doesn't play enough, it's that the 'random' spawn isn't so random. On our server, Galleon is always up within a couple hours of server maintenance, then a very small chance randomly later in the week. Problem is.. maintenance ends when most people are working. If you have a normal job and want to get gear from Galleon, you are screwed.</div></div><hr />

The World bosses act as the new &quot;Vault of Archavon&quot; type tier bosses. The next patch introduces a new raid, so it's only logical they add in the next tier of &quot;Archavon&quot; style boss.</div></div><hr />

Oh the irony with ganking. I thought 1 shotting in PVP was perfectly fine. It's all part of PVP right? If you don't like being one shot by a warrior don't PVP.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't aware charms were the sole source of the good gear. My apologies.<br />

Jeez<br />
<br />
Again, it's a server with no rules. If you have such a big problem with it, get some friends to follow you around for an hour or two on their mains. It's how you have always prevented being ganked. By bringing friends.<br />
<br />
And if you don't have any friends willing to help you out, what are you staying on that server for anyway?<br />
<br />
Yes, this sounds harsh. But so is the reality of PVP servers. It's not fluffy unicorns and rainbows, it's war. And there are no rules in war.<br />

Actions that would typically be considered &quot;dishonorable&quot; are considered legitimate PvP tactics and will not be addressed by our Game Master (GM) staff. Actions that fall into this category include, but are not limited to:<br />
<br />
Corpse camping.<br />
Tricking players into getting flagged for PvP (i.e. jumping in the middle of another player's area effect spell).<br />
Killing players well below your level.<br />

In WoW it is.</div></div><hr />

The same cyclical arguments keep coming back and back and back PVP servers have too much ganking well I think that people need to remember that there is a large number of people out there who make it to level cap and then realize that they're not very good at the game. They don't do well in battlegrounds and they don't do well in looking for group usually is the guys with the four hour kick timer then what they do is they head to low level zones and use the fact that they have six figures for health against your 6000 health as the ultimate leverage to prove to themselves that they are good at the game. What I always suggest to people that are new to the game is to find some way to either record their names or get an add-on that will put them kill on site so when you do happen upon them with your max level toon you can get a little sweet revenge on them because you know they're going to be terrible at PVP and you can just camp them over and over.</div></div><hr />

In game revenge does not satisfy me. If I could find them in real life and gank them for real would be very sweet. Because you know, in real life they are hobbits beaten in school by all other students</div></div><hr />
