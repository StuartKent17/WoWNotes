<br />
However, at this point the most succesful guild is Paragon (http://www.paragon-wow.com/), they defeated Blood Queen Lanathel in heroic mode and are the only guild so far that managed to kill a limited try boss. Congratulations to them.<br />

Plush Wind Rider Cub and Gryphon Hatchling Pets Coming Soon<br />
The Pet Store is about to go plush! Introducing the Wind Rider Cub and Gryphon Hatchling, the first in a new line of cuddly, crafty critters scheduled to arrive exclusively in the online Blizzard Store in the weeks ahead. Each plush companion will come with a code for a matching in-game, non-combat, account-bound pet to fly by your side in Azeroth. Both Horde and Alliance players will be able to adopt either pet once they hatch in the online Blizzard Store. Keep your eyes on the sky -- and the official World of Warcraft website -- for more information. <br />

Activision Blizzard Q4 2009 Results<br />
Activision published their results for the Fourth Quarter of 2009 and released a handful of information, nothing really new here but it's worth a recap. <br />
<br />
Cataclysm will be released in 2010.<br />
Starcraft 2 will be released in 2010, the beta starts in February.<br />
The slides (http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ACTI/842401340x0x350074/e7001299-8cdf-4cff-b0bb-1fa9d995c716/ATVI_Q409_slides_FINAL.pdf) mention &quot;value added services&quot; a couple of times, it is most likely linked to Bornakk's post hinting at a &quot;premium&quot; service for the Auction House available from web.<br />
World of Warcraft still has 11.5m subscribers, it didn't change much since last year's announcement. <br />
<br />
Nothing really much more interesting on the World of Warcraft side here, you can always check Activision's website (http://investor.activision.com/results.cfm) if you like staring at big numbers. <br />

Why NOT balance the game around 1v1?<br />
I can answer that in three different ways:<br />
1) Because there are healers.<br />
2) We aren't going for a design where every player is a one person army with a counter for anything that gets thrown against you. We want you to have to rely on your allies. We want you to have weaknesses that someone else can exploit. How you handle your own weaknesses while trying to exploit those of your opponent is one of the ways you can demonstrate skill.<br />
3) It's ultimately a social game and the PvP experience is largely designed as team vs. team. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23094040257-why-not-balance-the-game-around-1v1.html))<br />

Lovely Charm Ulduar Farming Nerf (Come on, you all knew it was a huge exploit)<br />
If you are wanting to farm a lot of them for all of your alts, that's your call, but it shouldn't be trivial to get a ton of them and something you finish in 1-2 days if that's the case. The event is pretty long now, so there is time to farm them and now, yes, you may actually have to put some effort into it - that's all.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-death-knight/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Lack of Death Knights in Arenas<br />
It's easy to make statistics support a lot of different arguments if you aren't careful. Yes, overall the percentage of DKs compared to other classes in 3s is low. But if you look at the actual highly rated comps, DKs are in the second most common comp after RMP. So using stats like this, what you're really arguing is that DKs don't have a lot of comps in which they function really well (compared to say paladins or shaman who have a few different options). Or put another way, they have great synergy with warriors and maybe hunters. That's a different argument from saying DKs just can't do well in Arenas. If you're a good DK, clearly it's possible to get 2200+ rating or into the SK 100 or even into the top 10. <br />
<br />
[...] Look, I'm not an analyst, but I was a scientist, and I had a lot more statistics training than a lot of folks in the business sector are required to take. I've published papers in peer reviewed journals and taught college and all of that. So, yes, this is actually something I understand pretty well. (By contrast, programming is not something in which I am prepared to converse. I know the little bit of C++ that I've picked up from a long time in the industry, but I'm no programmer, nor do I pretend to be, nor do I need to be to do this job. But I do understand stats.)<br />
<br />
One of the things I understand is that it's complicated stuff. Being able to treat data fairly and support it with conclusions is not trivial, and honestly probably not the kind of thing you can realistically expect a lot of players without prior experience to be able to do. Very few people can do it period. And there is nothing wrong with that. Nobody is expecting a degree in statistics to be able to talk about class design or even class data. But that doesn't mean a number can be whatever you want it to be either. There is no simple measure of &quot;Arena awesomeness&quot; just like there is no measure of &quot;maximum encounter dps&quot; or &quot;tankiness&quot; or &quot;healiness.&quot;<br />
<br />
If your contention is that there aren't many kinds of comps in which a DK can be competitive, I think there are data to support that conclusion. The data that have been presented do not support &quot;DKs suck.&quot; That is why I am constantly trying to advocate just not going there. If you feel DKs are weak, then argue that point. But you likely need more than simply linking to Arena representation as your proof. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23094129267-dks-at-the-bottom-of-every-bracket-again.html))<br />

Destruction needs a little more DPS<br />
As I said before, we suspect Destruction will need a little more dps but we want to apply it in such a way that doesn't make Destruction the only logical choice for raiding warlocks. We're also cool with certain specs being better for certain fights. Having a three way tie in every conceivable situation is probably impossible. It just needs to be close enough that you don't feel like a bonehead for raiding with the spec you prefer to play.

Mobile Authenticator now available on Android phones<br />
A new Mobile Authenticator application appeared on the Android Market yesterday, it isn't officially announced yet but the application is indeed legit.<br />
Hi, I've been doing some asking and it seems that this application is actually official and was launched yesterday. <br />
<br />
The support page is also available and you can find it on Blizzard's site (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=31126). <br />
<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/android.jpg (http://us.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?locale=en_US&amp;articleId=31126)<br />
<br />
Reminder: Authenticators are great. If you want to link an authenticator to your phone go to http://mobile.blizzard.com/ (http://mobile.blizzard.com/), a lot of phones are supported and you'll probably find yours in the list.</div></div><hr />

Gratz to Paragon and all, but I'm disappointed with these hard modes. I knew the first few bosses were going to be pretty simple, but I was hoping the limited attempt bosses would be akin to Firefighter/3 Elder Freya or so, but one of the end wing heroic bosses being downed within 20 attempts? Come on ... aren't these bosses supposed to be Sunwell difficulty equivalent?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think i saw the latest date for Blizzcon to be October. Not August.<br />
SC2 will geta Mid Year Release, Cataclysm will be in the 2nd half of the year, but if not to compete with SC2 probably 3-4 months behind that.<br />
So you can assume an late september, early october release for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />

<br />
You know, I'd use an authenticator if Blizzard would adjust how you switch between accounts that are on the same Battle.Net account. I hate that I have to completely log out and switch accounts on the drop-down box, when there could (most likely) easily be a drop-down box on the Character Select screen. I've been playing WoW for awhile and never had an issue being hacked... I run NoScript and ABP in Firefox and take little heed in security past that. I get those silly phishing e-mails all the time, but it's as simple as just hovering over a link that looks legit and seeing how it goes to a completely and obviously fake URL.<br />
<br />
Oh and I'm soooo going to get both of those plushies... they'll go great with my stuffed Murloc ;D.<br />

I've actually been using the Java version of the authenticator on my android phone for quite a while now, there was a pretty easy to follow guide for it using Netmite's J2ME. Graphically the official one is much nicer, but I think I actually got my code faster with the java version thanks to that rooted warning screen... The worst part is the app asks for root permissions, but just closes out if you deny it.</div></div><hr />

I'm too lazy to find out what the &quot;exact&quot; differences are between normal and heroic/hard modes.<br />
<br />
I looked at WoWhead fast and see the damage output of bosses' abilities between different modes.<br />
So can I assume it's basically a similar approach to TotC 10/25, more HP, more damage only?<br />
And not like Ulduar hardmodes that the bosses gain new abilities, generally speaking of course?<br />

In no way am I saying I would able to do it with my guild of course. You can just say I'm heavily wondering about these heroic/hardmodes.</div></div><hr />

Gratz to Paragon and all, but I'm disappointed with these hard modes. I knew the first few bosses were going to be pretty simple, but I was hoping the limited attempt bosses would be akin to Firefighter/3 Elder Freya or so, but one of the end wing heroic bosses being downed within 20 attempts? Come on ... aren't these bosses supposed to be Sunwell difficulty equivalent?<br />
<br />
<br />
They are. Sunwell was cleared this fast by a select few as well, the guilds were just limited by the sunwell gate system.</div></div><hr />

Still, glad we at least have a year...but I'd be a little bummed if I didn't have at least a few weeks of solid playtime of Cata before school starts up in September.<br />
<br />
Now, Blizzard wouldn't steal Starcraft's thunder by opening Cataclysm beta during Starcraft beta, or even a few weeks after Starcraft's official release. So say beta starts in February, it goes for...2 months? We have Starcraft 2 in April-May. Give Starcraft a few weeks to settle down - now we're in June-July territory for the Cataclysm beta, leaving a Sept-Oct release for Cataclysm itself. I think this is a reasonable timeline to go off...right? So since Arthas will be in farm mode mid March, whats Blizzard going to give us for those 6 months?<br />

I don't remember where I had heard it, but blizzard said they are aiming for 1 x-pac a year. So I don't think they would do that. In all honesty I expect summer release, the last (Major) patch was in what Nov? If they wait THAT long, people would leave for other games because nothing a minor patch could bring would be interesting enough to stay for a year of nothing else to do. With the way things are moving right now, It is really looking like it would be no later than at least July MAYBE August. Just My opinion though.</div></div><hr />

Me neither, the AH is part of the game, if you can't login into the game, then you shouldn't be able to access the AH either. But I'm sure many will disagree with me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To add to this, the top guilds will be doing hardmode attempts with alt raids before doing them with their mains. I do expect to see attempts at the LK hardmode encounter, however we'll have to wait and see if they are able to kill it yet, or if one of the other hard modes is bugged/unkillable this week.<br />
<br />
China is able to play WoW again, that was posted in a news article many months back.<br />
<br />
And please stop QQ'ing over the hardmode content. Most of us will probably never see these hardmodes so get over yourself. The fact that it's now Thursday and only 1 end boss is down says enough. These guys are raiding around the clock afterall, give them and Blizz some credit.</div></div><hr />

But I'm sure many will disagree with me.<br />
<br />
<br />
What scares me is where they mention this being a premium service. So will everyone be able to check the status of your auctions but you have to pay a higher subscription to be able to adjust them over the web?<br />
<br />
I know blizz always said they would never sell in game gold but if they start selling the ability to make gold efficiently then that would be treading very close to the line if not over it I think. <br />
<br />
As for DKs in arena, I think the problem comes down a lot to being unable to put much pressure on a Holy Paladin without a DPS assist. A DK can't put enough pressure on a well geared Holy Paladin to make them actually cast a spell now, with cleanse, freedom and the very high healing of holy shock unmitigated a well geared holy paladin basically is untouchable by a DK. Holy Paladin right now is just an incredibly hard counter to the DK. <br />
<br />
What I think would be interesting would be to make two simple changes. Firstly, make cleansing diseases apply a mana drain to the cleanser. Everytime you cleanse a disease you lose 1% of your maximum mana. This would make cleansing much more of an applied defensive move than it is now. If you really want to prevent a burst you can cleanse but the cleanse spam that shuts the class down completely would be stopped. The second would be to make blood plague apply a very specific healing debuff that reduces the amount healed by instant spells by 50%. It wouldn't make it easy for a DK to burst down a healer but it would mean that a DK could at least eventually pressure a healer into having to do a hard cast spell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As you can see in this press release, back in january 2008 5.5 out of the back then 10 millionen subscribers came from asia, most of them assumingly from China.<br />
<br />
http://www.blizcon.eu/en-gb/company/press/pressreleases.html?080122<br />
<br />
<br />
I find it highly unlikely, that in the meantime the subscriber count in America/Europe has spontaneusly doubled to balance that loss, or have I missed the dozens of new servers open up since then?<br />
<br />
Without China, the current subscriber count is probably somewhere between 5 and 6 million accounts at best. Perhaps a bit smaller, since we have no proof that the mentioned 11.5 millions still are current numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing really much more interesting on the World of Warcraft side here, you can always check Activision's website (http://investor.activision.com/results.cfm) if you like staring at big numbers. <br />
<br />
<br />
Um, 11.5 million subscribers &quot;still&quot;.... but AFAIK isn't WoW China still shut down (or doesn't have Wrath)???<br />
<br />
Considering that was half their playerbase, how the fuck is that &quot;not much of a change?&quot;<br />
<br />
To have completely covered the loss due to not having Wrath in China is pretty fucking impressive. I'm 100% certain they didn't squeeze all the millions of Chinese WoW players onto the Taiwanese servers (like what Stars did).</div></div><hr />

Yes we are broken. Yes we can compete in the top at the highest level of competition. no most people will not. Sure if you are in a top guild and can only do your job you might be good, hell maybe even real good. But in real time most warlocks cant even hope to touch the meters as it is right now. In a fight like festergut i go affliction stack on everyone and sure i run right there. But in a normal fight i cant even hope to go affliction and its not just me another guildie warlock switched to affliction beacause its just better right now and in most fights he goes back to destro.<br />
<br />
Now comes the real point destro is behind, period. No way around it. But since for most people its really the only viable raid spec for the semi-casual/hardcore player then its mostly what we are stuck with because of the lack of nukes with affliction. There are two ways two fix this; one is to shorten the cast time of shadow bolt by .5 secs make it talents w/e it makes SB as a viable nuke to use for adds and such. Also if you wanna fix destro go and make our main nuke inc more dmg. Its that simple either talent it to w/e u think it needs or if your worried about pvp buff the glyph as im sure most dont use it in pvp. <br />
<br />
also if you wanna buff demo more do what you should; buff the felguard. Its really not that hard to figure these things out is it? I understand there is some spill over into pvp but is it really so much that the pet couldnt use a buff. thats the whole point to demo is the pet.</div></div><hr />

SC2 will geta Mid Year Release, Cataclysm will be in the 2nd half of the year, but if not to compete with SC2 probably 3-4 months behind that.<br />
So you can assume an late september, early october release for Cataclysm.<br />

Which results in a very, very, very ... long time raiding ICC. A new Raidboss will kill the -Lich King - theme of Wrath of the - Lich king -<br />

Does Blizzard have an open war with Microsoft? How long should we wait for WM authenticator?<br />
<br />
<br />
Simply put, iPhone and Android are &quot;consumer&quot; smart phones. They are mostly in the hands of people who went to the Apple/Verison/AT&amp;T store and bought a smexy new phone. These people are allowed to, and indeed seem to revel in, installing new applications and using their phones for everything short of kitchen blenders (willitblend.com proved that iPhones make very poor kitchen blenders) Blackberries and WM phones are mostly purchased by companies for their employees. Many people who have them even have a second cell phone (smart phone or regular) for personal use so they don't get accused of misuse of company resources. They are often controlled by corporate IT which prevents (either through direct means, or via policy) people from installing their own apps. <br />
<br />
There are exceptions to both of these rules. Companies have standardized on the iPhone, and individuals have purchased Blackberries or WM phones, but a look at the market demographics for each type of phone makes the iPhone and Android much more attractive as initial platforms. <br />
<br />
At any rate, I know there's a JVM for WM, isn't there a Java version of the Authenticator software?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be completely honest, I don't think it has to do with gear give-away and easy bosses, as much as...<br />
<br />
More competition about world firsts<br />
More experience with ones class<br />
More experience with previous, similar working bosses (which you didn't have as much in vanilla or tbc, for obvious reasons)<br />
As for a vanilla comparison, less people (40 --&gt; 25) means less things to go wrong</div></div><hr />

I agree that Boomkins need more work than DKs but... Boomkin is a spec not a class, you cannot compare the representation of a spec to the representation of a class.<br />

<br />

<br />
<br />
I respect what you're trying to say here Failbot, but there is one thing you need to consider;<br />
<br />
Assuming that a class with alternate (and successful) specs to choose from is fine where it's at isn't fair IMO. That's like Blizz basically saying &quot;If you're a Druid and you want to PVP, you *must* be Resto. What if I only play 1 spec? What if that's the only spec I enjoy or am any good at? So if I want to PVP I absolutely have to be Resto? That's not fair.<br />
<br />
So with that point in mind, from a certain point of view, you absolutely *can* compare the representation of a class to the representation of a spec because most players are not masters of multiple specs in PVP, and prefer to stay one spec.<br />
<br />
I'll use myself for an example; I love being a Boomkin. Blizz can neglect it all they want, keep buffing their love children like Mages and Rogues, and ignore us all day. That's fine, whatever. I don't need a FOTM spec/class to enjoy the game. <br />
<br />
However, Boomkins suck in pvp, and pretty much always have. I was a Boomkin back in S3/S4 and played with a Rogue. Got a tad over 1800 which isn't all that awesome, but it's not total fail either. Could I have facerolled Resto those seasons? Sure. But I didn't want to. <br />
<br />
Same thing goes for the present day. I enjoy Feral, but I suck at Feral PVP unless it's mindless world ganking. I'm decent at Resto, but I seriously hate that spec. I only have it as on offspec to help out the guild with raid heals when we're in a jam, and for fast daily random ques. <br />
<br />
So my point to all this is that I play a specific spec which mine as well be a class because it's really all I do, and I certainly feel entitled to the *same* (not more) attention to my spec's shortcomings as every other class. <br />
<br />
Problem is, Blizz sees where the money comes from and typically spoon feeds its largest customer base, which unfortunately is usually DKs. <br />
<br />
All these kids made one the second they got home with the expansion in hand thinking they would finally show everyone what's what with their shiny new hero class. And in the beginning, they were ridiculously OP. Anyone who says otherwise is either lying or misinformed. <br />
<br />
Now they get brought back into the realm of reason and they're upset. I guess I would be too if my class was faceroll OP for months only to get knocked back down to where everyone else is at. <br />
<br />
They cry rivers of pain and sorrow because they want to be good at this game, but need a class and not skill to carry them. And Blizz caters to this because it's all about max number of subscriptions. <br />
<br />
Sorry for the rant, it's just something that irritates me a bit.</div></div><hr />

I started my DK later so i just missed the faceroll seasons :). <br />
<br />
But yeah i know what u mean... Boomkins need to be fixed so true, i love that spec too. Played as a boomkin since s4 as offspec and s5-s7 as main spec. Then farmed feral gear just because i wanted to compete better in arenas...<br />
<br />
But still, i think the main goal would be to make every class better in PvP before specs. But Boomkins have sucked so long that i wouldn't mind the buff for them b4 a buff for DKs. Dont care tbh. But still i'd say that Class has prio over spec.<br />
<br />
But as you said, they are too busy buffing mages and rogues... But hey! we got a 3% spell dmg buff!!!!!! that helps soo much in PvP! (Sarcasm alert)</div></div><hr />

You're a fucking moron. Boomkin =/= Class.<br />

Both Resto and Feral are extremely viable Glad specs. Boomkins can get attention when Fire Mages, Combat/Sub Rogues, Blood/Frost DKs, Fury Warriors, Demo Locks, and Holy Priests get viable glad specs.</div></div><hr />

Um no, you don't HAVE to spec anything to PVP. You *will* do BETTER as Y spec than X spec though, that's never going to change, the only difference is how much better.<br />

There ARE people who get Gladiator as Boomkin, what's holding you back is your skill level, partners, gear and comp, not the spec.<br />

And just crying that &quot;it's not fair!&quot; isn't a good argument, no amount of buffing is going to magically put you in the top 0.5% of players, stop making excuses that it's your class that makes you bad at PVP.</div></div><hr />

People who need a certain phone for work(in my case a blackberry) would certainly be willing to pay $1-2 for the authenticator app. I think it's silly that 2 out of maybe 20 widely used mobile devices are being supported.<br />

My Blackberry can play my Sirius satellite radio, can read e-books from my Kindle, I can't imagine it could possibly be that much farther into the future that it will have an authenticator app.</div></div><hr />
