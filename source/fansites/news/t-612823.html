The 3.0.2 Content patch introducing some of the WotLK features before the release of the expansion might be deployed on PTRs sooner than what we expected ...<br />
None of the classes are done. They are still being iterated on. 3.0 will be on the PTR's soon. There is still a lot of testing before 3.0 would go live to public servers.<br />
<br />
If you look back at past patches, we've had patches on the PTR for over 2 months before. <br />
Also, the european PTR forums have already been cleaned from all posts to get ready for the new PTR Phase - 27/08 PTR forum cleaned (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/5591699844-2708-ptr-forum-cleaned.html)<br />
To keep this forum relevant to the current or upcoming version on the PTRs, all old threads have been removed. This will be done soon after each patch test cycle is completed and the patch is applied to the regular realms.<br />
<br />
Informational sticky threads will be reposted after each forum wipe, and as new information about the current or upcoming patch becomes available it will be added in this forum. <br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements - Feats of Strength (Realm First)<br />
Realm Firsts are implemented in the next beta build although they will be slightly broken due to the fact that we have data issues with existing beta testers. For now, here's the list. We'll probably add more.<br />
<br />
Realm First to 80<br />
Realm First &lt;insert class here&gt; to 80<br />
Realm First &lt;insert race here&gt; to 80<br />
Realm first &lt;insert tradeskill or secondary skill&gt; to 450<br />
Realm First 10/25 end-boss kills<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, this will be broken on beta realms slightly. For example, in the current build, Realm First Mage to 80 is actually implemented. Well, Daelo, our Lead Encounter Designer, was testing something and leveled a Mage to 80 instantly and got the achievement for the server. On live realms, this will never happen. On live realms, all blizzard employee accounts are not counted toward server-firsts. But this part of the technology was not yet implemented.<br />
<br />
Also, when those Realm First achievements go live, they won't be accurate on the beta realms. But on live realms, the data will be pure and the information will display correctly.<br />
<br />
Something to note about Realm Firsts:<br />
<br />
A Realm First window stays open for 1 minute after initial completion of the Feat Of Strength. This means if 25 people kill Malygos as a Realm First, they'll all get credit. But what this also means is that if two players reach level 80 within a minute of each other, they will both get credit as well. <br />
Also note that achievements might be tracked as soon as the upcoming content patch is deployed on live servers.<br />
Originally, the answer was no. We were going to wait until Northrend opened. But we will most likely put the system live for 3.0. This could of course change but the current leaning is to put the system live with 3.0. <br />
<br />

Blue posts<br />
Flying Mounts in Dalaran<br />
For the time being, it is intended that you cannot fly within the city of Dalaran. We want you to be able to fly into Dalaran and fly out of Dalaran (via mounting at the flying landing or in the sewer pipe) but we don't want people flying around the city streets. We do want people to be able to mount on their ground mounts in the city (but not indoors).<br />
<br />
This isn't entirely set up properly yet and not all things are working. Most of this will be implemented over the coming weeks. If it's horrible, we'll change it. But that's what we're trying out right now.<br />
<br />
A big complaint of Shattrath was that it did not feel like a city. A goal of Dalaran was to re-capture the bustling street feel of places like Stormwind and Orgrimmar. Flying mounts work contrary to this goal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9232546393-flying-in-dalaran.html))<br />
<br />
Changes to Illidan encounters with the 3.0.2 patch and new talents<br />
Changes can be made to encounters if we feel they are necessary to allow the fight to work right. That said, the release of the patch isn't tomorrow, it's sometime in the coming weeks, so you still have time to work on the raids. Good luck on Illidan.

Netherdrakes in WotLK<br />
We don't have any current plans to remove the ability to get the Netherdrakes in Outland, we'll let you know if anything changes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/9244876781-bye-bye-dragon.html))<br />

Lack of rogue changes in WotLK Beta<br />
Beta implies that the game is in a testing process and currently incomplete. Your assistance in testing and providing feedback is much appreciated, however, we ask that you remain patient while we continue to push out new content, abilities, and balancing adjustments each week.<br />
<br />
No class is going to be left behind when all is said and done. The point of working through a Beta process is to ensure the product is fully polished by the time it is slated for release. We ask that you consider this before expressing frustration over a lack of battle-ready talents and abilities for your class in its current state. We will continue to push out changes for the Rogue class -- as with every other class -- so you will all have plenty of time to test out the updates.

Intensify Rage<br />
Thank you for bringing up this concern. After examining the situation we agreed this would potentially be a problem. Precision and Intensify Rage have now switched places in the talent tree. We want this to be something that a furry warrior has access to without making arms warriors feel they have to have it to be functional.

<br />
There's no way it'll be ready for live by then. PTR almost definitely, but the PTR for changes this sweeping will take 8 weeks minimum.<br />
<br />
Hmm, not sure how much I like the server first achievements. I guess there's really no *reward* for it, so it's just a way for the server to confirm firsts for posterity, rather than keeping info like that in sticky posts in realm forums. I just know I won't get any server firsts given I can't play 24/7 for two weeks after launch like some people will. :) And as a completionist, it'll suck seeing things on my list I literally *can't do*.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They won't. I don't know if you were around for the 2.0 patch pre-TBC, but it will activate the 51-point talent trees, a few new trainable level 70 spell ranks, game mechanics changes (i.e. major changes to shield block, elimination of downranking, and so forth), itemization changes (all spelldamage will become &quot;spellpower&quot;, melee/caster hit/haste/crit ratings will be combined, and so on), etc, but the level cap will remain 70 and new zones will be blocked. It'll be just like how the current game is for someone who doesn't own the TBC expansion: No access to Outland, level cap at 60, but 41-point talent trees and ratings instead of straight %ages, so not like Vanilla either. Just switched to as if WotLK was fully active but no one owns the expansion yet so things are blocked.</div></div><hr />

Multi boxers take longer to level than single toons because of shared xp and the impracticality of collection quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The only reason 2.0 &quot;destroyed&quot; pre-BC raiding (it didn't, by the way, but that's the myth you're working from) was because everyone decided to grind BGs for HWL gear instead. That's already going on today on live servers, and 3.0 won't do anything to change it either way!<br />
<br />
Also, to those saying WotLK won't be out until late December/January... you're wrong. The place we're at now in WotLK beta is equivalent to where we were in late November or early December for BC beta. They have opened up level 80 on the Wrath beta already, after all. Expect WotLK out in October or early November at the latest.</div></div><hr />

Or that they broke a whole ton of raid encounters making them impossible to complete? <br />
<br />
A myth? Did you even try and raid after 2.0 was released? Everything went to hell in a handbasket and that had nothing to with with attendance. <br />

Mr. IKnowI'mRight please tell us the exact date of release? You seem to have some inside information we aren't aware of... <br />

But my *theory* is still Dec. 5th for the Christmas market/holiday. That would allow Bliz to get Northrend a lot more polished than it is if they shipped today.</div></div><hr />

Now all I have to do is make it just right for release.<br />

I expect to have them rolling off the assembly line by September 17th.<br />
<br />
Translation for the satire-impaired: Many, many, MANY new talents aren't even IMPLEMENTED yet. Much of the beta is still design-complete ON PAPER but not even begun to be BUILT. Many other talents have gone through several iterations of BROKEN, proving implementation is not trivial. In addition, the design itself isn't even necessarily complete, as many aspects of balance and raid buff design have been thrown into question by recent blue posts, showing the design itself is still in flux, so really they haven't even drawn the flying car yet and are still in the erasing the fins to redraw them slightly differently over and over again phase.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reasons raiding stopped were mostly down to<br />
1: everyone went to do PvP, as patch 2.0 saw the introduction of &quot;welfare epics&quot;<br />
2: decursive was bugged. decursive was just too important for many 40-man bosses. For any guild which did Chromagus in BWL with this addon, having it removed was a SERIOUS problem. Never mind other bosses being bugged, this was enough of an issue to put people off.<br />
<br />
This time, neither of these things will cause any issues. We have Welfare Epics already, and decursive isn't as important as it once was, due to decreased raid size. The most likely problem this time is Illidan's sheer when shield block gets changed, or if scaling adjustments on some classes effect Sunwell bosses too badly.<br />
<br />
As for your estimate at the date, i'd agree, they'll want to release in time for Christmas, so early December sounds right.</div></div><hr />

They state the reason for this being that they want the city to seem more like old world capital cities, ie: bustling with activity and seeming more like a city. The only way it's going to seem like a &quot;city bustling with activity&quot; is if they put an AH in there, quick access to profession/class trainers, and possibly somewhere to duel. Otherwise, people are still just going to hang around Ironforge and Orgrimmar. <br />
<br />
It's not just because you could fly in Shattrath that people don't like hanging out there. It's because there's nothing to do there except go to the bank. I think it would be silly to do away with flying in a city. But as far as I know, Blizzard doesn't plan on having either class trainers or an AH in Dalaran, so... boo.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my two cents.</div></div><hr />

It's not just because you could fly in Shattrath that people don't like hanging out there. It's because there's nothing to do there except go to the bank. I think it would be silly to do away with flying in a city. But as far as I know, Blizzard doesn't plan on having either class trainers or an AH in Dalaran, so... boo.<br />
<br />
Anyway, my two cents.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
you kinda answered yourself there.<br />
<br />
blizz wants us to hang in Org and IF. they have said that all along. its the exact reason thats where the ah and trainers and dualling areas are. they also want us on the ground in dal to give the old city &quot;feel&quot;. not to make it like an old city but to just make it feel busier. the city is not a hang out. its smaller than any other capital city so its not really going for that home base kinda thing like shatt had.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now all I have to do is make it just right for release.<br />
<br />
I expect to have them rolling off the assembly line by September 17th.<br />
<br />
Translation for the satire-impaired: Many, many, MANY new talents aren't even IMPLEMENTED yet. Much of the beta is still design-complete ON PAPER but not even begun to be BUILT. Many other talents have gone through several iterations of BROKEN, proving implementation is not trivial. In addition, the design itself isn't even necessarily complete, as many aspects of balance and raid buff design have been thrown into question by recent blue posts, showing the design itself is still in flux, so really they haven't even drawn the flying car yet and are still in the erasing the fins to redraw them slightly differently over and over again phase.<br />
<br />
<br />
Are you even remotely aware of what the most time consuming part of producing an expansion like this is? From your post I'll assume not, so I'll tell you: the art. The time required to create the art so incredibly dwarfs the rest of the process that you may as well round the rest to zero.<br />
<br />
The art, from most reports, is mostly done. That means the expansion is mostly done. Implementing talents isn't a process that takes weeks. It's something one person does in hours (and that's being very generous to your point of view). And yes, I am a programmer... you need to understand that they already have the tools in place. They are not writing a large application from scratch, they are adding to it using tools designed to make it easy to add to it. Yes, they then have to test for bugs and that is time consuming. Implementing the talents? No way, no how does that take more than a couple of hours max.<br />
<br />
So yes, they are much, much closer to release than you seem to think they are. Implementing the NYI talents is something they are doing on a class-by-class basis. Why do people assume that the developers at Blizzard are standing around picking their noses except for the one moment of the week when a new build is released? Internal testing is certainly several builds ahead of the beta.<br />
<br />
And also remember... when 2.0 came out, it was not based on the most recent BC beta build! It still had Cloak of Shadows as a 41 point talent, among many other things, when the active BC beta client had it as a trained skill! So, don't expect things to be in their final state just because they push out a 3.0. The WotLK beta will continue for at least a month after 3.0 hits the live servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeh. They basically did 2 patches. <br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_2.0.1 (http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_2.0.1) --- talent trees, arenas, etc<br />
http://www.wowwiki.com/Patch_2.0.3 --- class balance, and other issues.<br />
So yeh, don't expect stuff they release with the pre-patch to remain the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
changing a variable takes so no time ... adding/removing an effect from a spell is as easy at typing a &quot;1&quot; or a &quot;0&quot;.. even changing a boss encounter so he cleaves every 15 seconds instead of 10 is trivial... this is all relative to creating a new creature model, or even creating sound effects.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They are creating more models? Most I've seen have been used before. Recycling Earthfury for shamans etc.<br />
<br />
Balancing talents and testing them does in fact take quite a while as you need to build up enough statistical data (eg 1000s of Dr Boom tests) to ensure that the talents are effecting abilities properly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A myth? Did you even try and raid after 2.0 was released? Everything went to hell in a handbasket and that had nothing to with with attendance. <br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, which raid encounters? I was (and still am) leading a raiding guild who although not bleeding edge, are fairly competant. On the day of 2.0 we walked into Naxx, and cleared all of the spider wing, all of the plague wing, and up to 4HM in the DK wing... The only issue was no decursive on Noth, and it took us all of 2 wipes to realise that spreading out and making mages focus on decursing would win that for us.</div></div><hr />

Ahhh, there's a good point - they'll maybe try for a Friday release, this gives everyone the whole weekend to try to get server firsts, and means everyone won't need to take days off work.... December 5th is a Friday :)</div></div><hr />

For the time being, it is intended that you cannot fly within the city of Dalaran. We want you to be able to fly into Dalaran and fly out of Dalaran (via mounting at the flying landing or in the sewer pipe) but we don't want people flying around the city streets. We do want people to be able to mount on their ground mounts in the city (but not indoors).<br />
<br />
This isn't entirely set up properly yet and not all things are working. Most of this will be implemented over the coming weeks. If it's horrible, we'll change it. But that's what we're trying out right now.<br />
<br />
A big complaint of Shattrath was that it did not feel like a city. A goal of Dalaran was to re-capture the bustling street feel of places like Stormwind and Orgrimmar. Flying mounts work contrary to this goal. (Source)<br />
