Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
if we level in legion through BGs or skirms, will we work towards the honor to prestige early or does that start at 110?<br />
Starts at 110 (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/682009047583690757))<br />
<br />
Rewards<br />
Hmm, people hated ridiculous RNG with regards to X. Maybe they'll like it if it's ridiculous RNG on Y instead!<br />
RNG Realtalk: it's been a staple of RPGs for years, it exists and can even be exciting (see: Ashes of Al'ar), is it good? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682092506339618816))<br />
sure, but there's a diff between a rare drop of loot, and an item with a low-single-digits drop chance once per year.<br />
Some players have tweeted that they like the rarity, appreciate the social value of showing off their rare loot. Valid? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682093637656690688))<br />
Not trying to sound like a jerk, just putting this towards you as a developer on twitter, and what you do! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682093932226822144))<br />
Is it the majority, or even a significant minority? I know I personally see more RNG hate than rarity love 1/2<br />
Does it matter? When is the minority right? When is the majority? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682094534268878849))<br />
&quot;Right&quot; is subjective here. Very subjective. Majority tends to win in subjective matters, particularly in regards to product prefs<br />
I think if the majority of players feel a negative feeling towards something, there is something wrong, even if it's not that. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682095353408000000))<br />
But that might be confirmation bias. Still, strikes me as something that might be a bit TOO rare. Ashes et al is 52/year.<br />
I think there is an intrinsic &quot;effort value&quot; that goes into rewards that can be obtained multiple times. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682094860153667590))<br />
Once/year/character feels like luck, one/day/character feels like effort. The latter is more satisfying, even if you don't win? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682095010334904320))<br />
Rewards from effort/repetition are almost always more rewarding, long-term, then rewards from strike-of-lightning luck.<br />
Yet we've had a resurgence in the requests for random Legendaries, recalling HOR, TF, glaives, etc. Different? Same? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682095731407106048))<br />
Or just nostalgia? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682095831831330816))<br />
Casinos don't have machines that only give one try per visit/day. No one plays them. People play repetitive luck games, rabidly.<br />
(FWIW it will be moved to the Stolen Present next year, same with all of the new-per-year gifts) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682096421110022144))<br />
Casinos don't have machines that only give one try per visit/day. No one plays them. People play repetitive luck games, rabidly.<br />
I don't know if you, ethically, want to model your system after casinos. Where's the line? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682096536952549376))<br />
Example, if bonus roll tokens were a 1% chance instead of the ~20% chance they are now, how many people do you think would bother?<br />
Related: the droprates for Pandaren rares were 10-30%. Timeless Isle they were much less, but lasted for longer. Which was better (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682098344122945536))<br />
And Huolon was the big one. Low droprate, but he could be farmed every ~45m. Not once per year.<br />
I still can't believe people figured out that you could albatross troll and pull from atop the bridge, emergent gameplay++ (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682099063722909696))<br />
Poor comparison, since timeless isle was a lot of &quot;well, there's nothing else to do&quot;.<br />
Prefer Tanaan? Cata endgame? WOTLK? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682098793676804100))<br />
So ya, Tanaan washed not because of design (which was REALLY good for dailies), but lack of long-term rewards.<br />
Maybe day-to-day variance in the events in each area? Let predictability not just in which area, but what you do while there?<br />
We had a lot of this in MOPs endgame, how did that feel? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682100431154053122))<br />
.I personally *much* preferred the MoP endgame, in 5.0-5.2, TI/apexis/tanaan, had no story, and are boring IMO :/<br />
To me, Story is the main thing we need to learn from this. Please check out World Quests/reps in Legion (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682114366678773760))<br />
World needs to feel &quot;alive&quot;.<br />
Yep (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682114680899276803))<br />
.tanaan was just apexis dailies, nothing fun in regards to mechanics, again, IMO.<br />
I agree with you both, btw Please check out the World Quests system in Legion (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682118009901613056))<br />
<br />
Raiding<br />
Some interesting comments in your alts though - why can you do nothing with them but LFR? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682099860506456064))<br />
Well, if they are geared enough to do normal+, they don't need upgrade tokens. If they need tokens, can't get into normal.<br />
If you could make one change to make normal PUGs a reality, what would you change? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682100635211182081))<br />
So getting runs on alts that are actually at appropriate itemlevel for the difficulty is frustrating, especially as DPS.<br />
True, ilvl is a shortcut to dps, but isn't 100% accurate. If you could replace the ilvl system, what would you do? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682101381256224768))<br />
But how do you grade that? Lots of mechanics were some people standing in bad is good, or required, but many isn't<br />
Standing in Fire has also gotten a lot more complex over time. Compare Patchwerk to Blackfuse. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682106006801760256))<br />
Mr. Feasel, with all due respect you surely see that Ilvl is the new GS?<br />
Yep, and there needs to be ways to combat this. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682115120235823104))<br />
Covered that. But community wants their yard stick. Take away one, they'll make another. AotC already that way.<br />
The design goal is thus: what is the most effective unit of measurement, if there is one? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682115469101240322))<br />
Loath to add more queues. I *LIKE* the new Group Finder tool. Still, begs the question with the community grades off meters.<br />
Yeah the &quot;I can't apply for a job because I haven't had a job because I can't apply for a job&quot; problem is alive and well in MMOs (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682102923954765824))<br />
*Maybe* have the system, when queued for raids, show tooltip info on your experience in that raid (account wide, all difficulties)<br />
Maybe have a Normal queueing system that operates like HOTS, matching players of lower skill with higher to average into a win? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682102160625029121))<br />
But then those players are admonished by the better players for having low DPS, and quit (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682102266686377985))<br />
Have quarter-baked idea where loot drop add per player being higher for lower-geared chars. Needs checks, but could work.<br />
This was kind of the idea behind Flex, the difficulty didn't really increase, while the players did. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682103351002071040))<br />
(c) increase mechanics, with an ilvl-based break point where a raid could still over-gear a fight (c)<br />
Increasing mechanics is scary. When you leave a mechanic out of LFR, a PUG dies to it in normal, and is kick (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682106655719358464))<br />
I think for mythic you need to have one-shot and &quot;single player can make a wipe&quot; mechanics<br />
Definitely do need them for Mythic. Norm/Hero, if you screw up, you might die. In Mythic, you wipe the raid.<br />
On every fight? Or can some be &quot;tank can relax&quot; fights? Or healer, dps? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682109779964104704))<br />
Forgiveness fluctuates per role per fight, certainly. DPS low responsibility on Iskar. Tanks low on Council.<br />
TBH, back in the day, I really appreciated the contrast (as a dps) of Patchwerk vs. Loatheb (1.0, fire mage) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682110758675582978))<br />
even if that person is normally very good, with 20 players, high % chance someone can have an off moment<br />
Alex Afrasiabi introduced me to this concept of &quot;skill entropy,&quot; smart dude (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682111800414879745))<br />
<br />
Or did you mean an automated SimC-type thing in-game. Isn't that reinforcing DPS-output = worth?<br />
Perhaps there's a way to gauge performance and apply a value that more accurately reflects it... (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682104578460921862))<br />
Maybe there's even a way to incorporate a positive outlook into it? And/or a leadership quality? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682104734807789568))<br />
Sounds like a Karma system. Which *could* work, but requires player engagement, which typically requires rewards.<br />
Has it worked for LoL? Good case study on cutting-edge social engineering. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/682105372769816576))<br />

<br />
Looks like people are just seeing a poll with expansions as choices and voting WOTLK. Kinda funny how during WOTLK, it was endlessly decried as &quot;casual expansion&quot;, &quot;world of casualcraft&quot;, &quot;wrath babies&quot;, etc...and now everyone seems to love it.<br />
<br />
Anywho, since WOTLK didn't really have much endgame world content outside of dailies and wintergrasp, I'd vote Cata or MoP. Those both had a bunch of interesting non-raid world stuff (Tol Barad, Timeless Isle, etc).</div></div><hr />

Can't stomach to grind those fake-y scenes-without-real-purpose again. I don't know the right words as my english is still lacking, but timeless/tanaan feel like they are some set up scenes in theatre. <br />
<br />
I still vote MoP. Cata comes as a second. WoD may have had world content, but most of it was boring and just... pointless.<br />
<br />
Edit: imo argent tournament was still the best daily hub. For some reason it feels like &quot;real&quot; zone for me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree. I had everything done in Tanaan except collecting the claws within about the same amount of time. All i see of Tanaan now is the short flight from portal to raid entrance, or once in a blue moon ill spend a little time doing the apexis things for the weekly event.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pandaren are retarded but MoP had extensive world building with Farmville, Krasarang and the Isle of Thunder. Wrath had WG which I only played on a lop sided server.</div></div><hr />

or<br />
<br />
we can call argent tournament endgame content but then we should do the same with Isle of Thunder and then MoP win easily</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. It's the Wrath-crop finding wrath as an option in a poll and choosing it. I hardly see anyone praising the argent tournament and yet apparently 50% thinks it was the best outdoor endgame area ever all of a sudden? Really? Jousting? It was THAT fun?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grapefruitsnz</div><div class="date">2016-01-03, 10:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Key word is World, which WotLK had very little of, if any. Argent tournament and the various daily hubs was it. As has been said, looks to be some nostalgia biting people. Personally feel that MoP had a great amount of World content, between the usual daily hubs, the Farm, Timeless Isle and Isle of Thunder.</div></div><hr />

WotLK didn't have any end-game world content. Argent Tournament wasn't even end-game content, it was released in patches 3.1 and 3.2, so mid-expansion. ICC came with patch 3.3. The only reason I can think of why people might see the Argent Tournament as end-game content is because it took months to get everything related to the Argent Tournament completed.<br />
<br />
Looking at some of the comments I can only conclude that the results of this poll have to do with anything but end-game content :p</div></div><hr />

At launch you had some pretty good daily hubs, three raids (two of them being one boss raids and Naxx being multiple wings), Wintergrasp which was a fun thing to jump into to try and get into another optional winged raid for the week regardless of if you liked PvP or not, plenty of heroics to run (as easy as they were). By the end of the expansion they had added four raids, three more heroics, a pretty extensive daily area that could keep you occupied for months getting all the things from it, plus all sorts of other random things to do that mostly included achievements (since they were new in Wrath.) I genuinlly felt I had more to do in Wrath then I do currently in WoD. Barely any daily content, heroics provide nothing besides Valor, none of the raids are worth doing except Hellfire and most of the world content can be done in a few months not to mention that the world content isn't even interesting enough to keep me coming back. I end up just logging into to do my garrison and that's it.</div></div><hr />

But, hey, we all know about the lazy millionaires in blizzard - it's so much effort for them - judging by pathetic quests for legendary's.<br />

The Argent Tournament is still a pretty good place. There's a good amount of dailies and lots of different rewards for the grinds. You can grind for titles, for mounts, achievements, quality of life items, heirlooms... There are both long term and short term goals. Wintergrasp remained relevant throughout the entire expansion for a lot of players thanks to the Vaults of Archavon. There were a few raids and dungeons worth doing over and over for random mount drops. They also added a quick raid instance at the end to give a little more to do before the next expansion. I think the 10 and 25m raid instances being separate lockouts was also a good way of adding something else to do for those who wanted more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I loved Wrath's endgame. It had some good daily quest hubs, and I actually liked the Tournament, but much of what I loved about Wrath was in the raids and dungeons, which don't count for this. Mists of Pandaria had some great daily areas, and I loved the Isle of Thunder. The Timeless Isle was less enjoyable, and has gotten worse over time imo, but not so much as to bring it down. Dominance Offensive was decent, but got old fast (and I didn't like the whole &quot;we're invaders, we're trying to fix our mistakes, but we still have time to kill each other&quot; idiocy, but then I never really did expect anything else from Garrosh or Wrynn.) <br />
<br />
-Burning Crusade comes in with a close second, for initiating daily quests in the first place and for the Sunwell Offensive. <br />
-Strictly for world content, Wrath would be next. <br />
-Cataclysm's content wasn't terrible, but wasn't extensive enough... and the last patch added nothing, so it was just the molten front. I did enjoy the molten front, but the first and last patches were very dull from a world content standpoint. <br />
-Draenor's world content was complete and utter garbage until 6.2, and 6.2 only somewhat improves the situation. The new apexis daily mechanic was horrid, and it isn't much better in Tanan. Reputations were atrocious, having no source outside of a mindless grind prior to 6.2, and you couldn't even do the grind in dungeons.<br />
<br />
Personal prefernece: I like daily quest hubs. Actual daily hubs; Isle of Quel'Danis, Isle of Thunder, Molten Front, Argent Tournament, Netherwing Isle are all great examples. The apexis dailies take too many potential tasks and combine them into one giant task, and do so in a way that makes them feel interminable (&quot;Hey, I just killed a large group of five mobs! I got.... 5% completion. Just 95 more to go...&quot;) Story progression is nice, but not absolutely necessary as long as there's a clear purpose (or to phrase it another way, Story is essential, Progression is nice but not required). <br />
<br />
The new world quest system for Legion may or may not work; it depends on how it's implemented, and in large part for me it will depend on whether it's a multi-step process or not. Half of what I hate about the Apexis dailies is that it's just one giant bar, and if you get interrupted halfway through you get nothing (whereas getting interrupted halfway through, for instance, the Isle of Thunder, meant you got half the rewards for completing some but not all of the quests.) I also hope they do reps in a better way; they moved away from mindless grinds in TBC, why they thought we needed to go back to a Vanilla model of rep is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrath had no endgame world content besides dailies, and I sure as hell remember people doing nothing but moan about them back then. During TBC, I loved Quel'danas but Wrath killed off dailies for me. There wasn't any decent end-game world content during Cataclysm that I recall, which either means it didn't exist or I didn't give a shit - don't remember which.<br />
<br />
Pandaria had the worst dailies system ever devised by blizzard until they introduced the timeless isle, which was the first endgame world content I enjoyed since Quel'danas. Legion gets a lot of stick, but tanaan is alright, as is treasure hunting over all of draenor, plus garrison quests - I'd say it actually has the best endgame world content to date. <br />
<br />
But it's not what the cool kids are saying these days, right?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JazzHunter</div><div class="date">2016-01-04, 12:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've voted WotLK because we were really out there in the wild. I don't remember people standing all day in Dalaran, like we do nowadays in the garrisons. In MoP... well, MoP was actually good relating world content, but it was very repetitive: too many rares, and later, they added timeless and all people went there all day. I prefer WotLK because there were hard things to do, like catching that Time Lost Protodrake, or the rare Spirit Beasts, or doing the Tournament Dailies. Definitely my favourite.<br />
<br />
Plus, WotLK had dragons. That was just enough for me.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">XDRage</div><div class="date">2016-01-04, 12:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm genuinely surprised to see WoTLK endgame world content at the first place. I loved the expansion, yes, I loved the raids, I loved the dungeons both normal and heroics and I loved the questing... But none of these are endgame world content. WoTLK had only dailies, and boring at that in the beginning, slightly better when the argent crusade came. But all of that felt to me like filler content not really worth my time and because of this I halted my subscription shortly after we cleared the ICC10HC and did most of the achievements that we could do with our small guild. The endgame world content wasn't too bad only because other content was so good and I had a guild to do it with.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind at all if that was the case in legion, but it will be harder to pull off, since the game looks better and better every expansion it takes longer to actually create vast amounts of content like WoTLK had (not to mention the new questing formula, which is nicer and smoother but takes more time to create too). We will have to end up with something like Tanaan again because it's more engaging than simple dailies in WoTLK.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: WTF people, WoTLK had almost no endgame world content to speak of! Still loved it though...</div></div><hr />

It was truly awesome the blood coining ffa system was some of the most fun I have ever had. The isle itself had a great mix of players of different skill and gear as there was something for pretty much everyone there. I loved the shrines and different buffs, the rep grinds the item grinds, world boss, the rare system and just the overall layout and design of Timeless Isle has been head and shoulders above the rest.<br />
<br />
Apart from Timeless Isle I would say the last patch of TBC with the silvermoon island. Was a lot of fun having everyone working towards a goal and seeing the server wide progression of the island as the server acted to complete the phases. Was a lot of fun too for the time.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soeroah</div><div class="date">2016-01-04, 12:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I voted for MoP, with the following caveat.<br />
<br />
5.0, 5.1 and 5.2 was my favourite stretch of endgame out of any expansion. 5.3 and 5.4 was my least favourite, matched by 6.0.<br />
<br />
I was kind of hoping the poll would be split into more specific measurements, since MoP in particular had a 180 degree turn on end game halfway through, so just saying &quot;Mists was my favourite&quot; is ambiguous and confusing.</div></div><hr />

I have no idea why Wotlk is so high up, since it basically had nothing to offer people that were raiding. You could farm even more heroic dungeons for ICC gear, but after that you had nothing. The timeless isle and tanaan are very good zones for &quot;catch up&quot; mechanics and more social world content, and the garrisons still provide a lot of gold and useful items and resources, so they are definitely getting better at end game content.</div></div><hr />

Netherwing, Ogrilia, then Isle is probably best daily hub in the entire game. The argent tournament was fun for like a week, and after getting all the reps i needed I only did it for gold (buying selling pets), not to mention the tournament was in the TOTC patch, not ICC (which had no world content from what i remember), Cata for the most part lacked end game content. It did introduce pet battles so there is that. But the Firelands dailies are my 2nd favorite daily hub, but once again, once I got my rep it was boring. Mop, was ok, probably 2nd best in terms of end game content. A ridiculous amount of dailies, more dailies with Isle of Thunder, Farmville, what I think killed it for me though was timeless aisle, once you farmed all the rares it got old quick. I preferred the BOA tokens compare to WoD BOP tokens though. WoD is boring as shit, I can't even stomach to do the dailies on any of my toons, my main still doesn't have max rep, and I only do it on my alts when i run out of oil (but once I unlock oil rig, I pretty much stop doing them).</div></div><hr />

<br />
:p<br />
I think when people voted wrath they, like me, thought they were voting for the end game content with the undead ghouls that is actually the Burning Crusade and not Wrath of the Lich King. The endead event for Wrath was easily the funnest transition event from one x pac to another. I think that's how the poll should have been worded.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I read the line &quot;Feel free to tell us what you liked best (or least) specifically about the world content in the comments&quot; and I thought &quot;aah then the poll must be for endgame in general and they wrote the line as a point to start a conversation going&quot;.<br />
I even skipped the word &quot;world&quot; twice when reading the poll title and I guess I'm not the only one. :P<br />
<br />
I haven't played TBC's or MoP's endgame so I can't say firsthand, but from what I see MoP seems to have the most world content and both Timeless and Thunder isles are amazing, although I don't like MoP's atmosphere in general as much as I loved Wrath's scenery. Isle of Quel'danas is wonderful and it always feels worm and welcome when I visit it, I'd definitely hang out there if it was not isolated.<br />
Although Wrath and Cata didn't have much of world content, I enjoyed the scenery, the atmosphere and the music a lot and I was absolutely hooked to Tol Barad dailies. The zone's atmosphere was awesome and it had a lot of pvp.<br />
<br />
The endgame world content I like the least is definitely Tanaan. The daily apexis &quot;Strategic Assault Choice&quot; quest was ok, although it could be more engaging and interesting, but Tanaan itself is lackluster. The colors are dull, the music is not even memorable, despite the swamp and Fangrilla, there is no diversity in creatures, places or buildings. Everywhere feels like you are in the same spot killing orcs or the same 2-3 kinds of demons. The swamp, fangrilla and the draenei place don't blend in the rest of Tanaan, they are like separate zones &quot;glued&quot; there to make it feel vast and bigger.<br />
The Tanaan dailies are ok, but I am biased because I don't like the zone.</div></div><hr />

Various Daily Hubs which had a Storyline at each. Progressively doing dailies unlocked more and more story over a month or 2, it also rewarded you with Epic gear/Cosmetics AND Mounts for gaining the Rep whilst doing the stories. It really felt like you were becoming part of the Faction you were helping or at least being integral to their story,<br />
I.e. Helping Train the Shado-Pan/Saving their temple/Protecting their lands, whilst becoming friends with the different members of their order. <br />
Golden Lotus - figuring out the secrets of the Vaults whilst protecting from the Mo'gu,<br />
Mantid - raising the Paragons and helping them raise an army to fight against the corrupted Mantid<br />
Kirin-tor Offensive - Slowly taking control of an Island stronghold and pushing the enemy back to their Keep to eventually assault their throne.<br />
Celestials - training alongside the Gods of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
All of them were extremely well done and it was very sad that the whingers and complainers that whinge and complain about everything decided that Dailies were somehow too hard for them and got us the apexis endgame of WoD as a result.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draenox</div><div class="date">2016-01-04, 02:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Mists of Pandaria had the superior end-game world content, no question. 5.0, 5.1 and 5.2 all brought story, alongside with dailies, rares - something that actually felt like it meant something. Timeless isle was alright, but it started the trend that we have seen to a much larger extent in WoD, sort of &quot;empty&quot; content where there is a truckload of things to do, but none of them really matter, they're just there.<br />
<br />
WotLK was a good expansion, but it is surpassed by MoP for me in terms of world content quality</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ruvokus</div><div class="date">2016-01-04, 03:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">5.0 had so many dailies that it overwhelmed people. But there was a lot to do at least. And each had its own little story and objective to it. Personally, I think it was smart to lock some other factions behind Golden Lotus because it actually rewarded you for doing that faction even more and it meant more content to do after a while too. It was also smart to unlock those factions from Golden Lotus after a while too, since it had served its purpose and wasn't need anymore. I'll agree with people saying the dailies were a little overwhelming, especially if you're the sort of that felt like you had to complete every single one every single day.<br />
<br />
5.1 was really, really good. Combining single-time quests based on daily completion/rep standing was smart and kept you invested in doing every day. Having rotating sets of dailies was an even smarter move. That also helped to break up the monotony a lot by not just changing the actual daily but the location, as well. It was a brilliantly done execution and, in my opinion, the ultimate refining of the daily system.<br />
<br />
5.2 reused the Isle of Quel'danas system but refined it extremely well. A combination of personal and server progression was extremely smart. I also really loved the idea behind choosing between PvP and PvE dailies. It always felt actually worthwhile to go back and do the PvP dailies just for the Conquest bump, even in later patches. My only nitpick would be that PvE dailies felt like they were spread out too much - they should have stuck with the rotating sets being completed in different places from 5.1.<br />
<br />
Mists, hands down, wins the competition for best casual/world endgame content easily. Wrath was good for its time I think, but Mists truly took the dailies system and brought it to its best.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soeroah</div><div class="date">2016-01-04, 03:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To remind people, here's what world content was like in the expansions.<br />
<br />
TBC: A very few daily quests for the Skyguard and Ogri'la, eventually expanding to Cooking and Fishing dailies, the Netherwing dailies, and culminating in the AQ-similar Isle of Quel'Danas dailies, which sent you all over Outland as well as the Isle. Outside of dailies there wasn't much outside of dungeons and raids.<br />
<br />
Wrath: A few scattered dailies for factions like the Tuskarr and the Wyrmrest Accord, before the Argent Tournament was added and provided the first 'real' daily quest hub since the Isle of Quel'Danas. Much of it was jousting, so a lot of people didn't like it. Outside of dailies there wasn't much outside of dungeons and raids.<br />
<br />
Cata: Almost every faction had a set of daily quests that were the same each day, the Firelands added another hub with some randomness each day and branching paths to progress with. Outside of dailies there wasn't much outside of dungeons and raids. IIRC, very late in Cataclysm Transmogrification was added, which allowed for another type of content outside of current dungeons and raids, though whether that counts as 'world content' is debatable.<br />
<br />
Mists: Almost every faction had a daily quest hub, many with dailies that changed each day. These dailies provided a stronger story experience than most others had since the Netherwing, as your reputation unlocked extra sets of dailies and progressed an on-going faction-specific story. This was, to my recollection, the first time since TBC that reputation progression unlocked extra story content for a faction. Additionally, more world content was added in the form of 'farmable' rare mobs and pet battles/pet collection. 5.1 brought in a faction with an epic story that took you across Azeroth and tied in with the main plot of the expansion, and 5.2 was similar to the Isle of Quel'Danas in that it took a server-wide effort to unlock further content in the Isle outside of the raid, and progressed a story. Eventually the Timeless Isle was added, which was a mostly gameplay-driven catch up mechanism with rare spawns.<br />
<br />
WoD: Garrisons for 6.0 were basically it. 6.1 added a few new quests to support Garrisons. 6.2 Added Tanaan which emulated the Timeless Isle mixed with 'daily quests' which were just more Apexis quests with little story. No real progressing story was used for factions, the only thing similar was the Garrison Campaign which was more of a random, somewhat disconnected and weekly-gated storyline.</div></div><hr />

<br />
MoP had the largest amount of endgame content to date, but I can understand people feeling pressured to &quot;DO ALL DAILY QUESTS EACH DAY!!!&quot; and disliking it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ledger</div><div class="date">2016-01-04, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why is TBC not included? Skettis, Ogri'la, Netherwing, and the beautiful Isle of Quel'danas were all added in future patches, and are great.<br />
<br />
Completely forgot &quot;Isle of Quel'danas&quot;, juggling between WoD and TBC and felt WoD had the upperhand seeing as Skettis, Ogri'la and Netherwing weren't really amazing. I also considered MoP a little for Timeless Isle, but I'd rather have Tanaan than that place, and I didn't play much else in MoP so I might have missed out on a lot of things. With Quel'danas in mind I feel TBC gets it for me. Granted the variety is much better now, but it is still fundamentally the same shit where we are basically given these grindy dailies, minus the reward spree that we have now.<br />
<br />
People voting Wrath so high though either read the question wrong, or aren't good in the head. Argent Tournament was fun the first day or two, then boring as shit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raeliron</div><div class="date">2016-01-04, 04:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the issue with PvP is that Blizzard wants to make it into a specific zone. Why not be in all zones? Outside of raiding in The Burning Crusade, there was so much to do. When people were level 70, it was pure mayhem in Hellfire, controlling the three nodes for fervor for your faction. Same went for Zangramarsh with the two towers and the Bone Wastes. Things were so fun with world PvP. HALAA! God.. those were fun times as well. You could spend hours with buddies trying to take back the stronghold or defending it.<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp, Tol'Borad and Ashran were all failed attempts to glorify world pvp structurally. Just bring back the world pvp like Burning Crusade had, add tokens to collect and boom, people will have a legitimate reason to fight.<br />
<br />
Think of the lowbies that got the bonus because you helped. Or if you killed someone who was a higher level than you while leveling, they'd get their main and gank you to stop you from winning. THAT was what was fun about world pvp back then. <br />
<br />
Speaking of which, I feel like riling up Honor Hold and killing some Alliance? who's in?</div></div><hr />

WoD has been awful so far. LFR is abysmal with atrocious gear. There's little to no build up to bosses like there was in previous expansions. I mean these are supposed to be some of the biggest threats in the known Warcraft Universe and they've mostly been side bosses that have maybe a line of dialogue then completely gone. Also, the insane lack of end game content, even if you are a raider. <br />
<br />
While WotLK was my favorite expansion experience for the most part, MoP had far more content and was the best expansion by miles. Tons and tons of content and you didn't have to be a hardcore, schedule raider to enjoy everything. LFR was better. LFG was better. When not raiding there was always something to do. The only things WotLK did better was adding heroics after launch and better raid boss build up.</div></div><hr />

Argent Tournament might been &quot;awful&quot; but at least was filler content or i should said more content within the expansion, something that is rarely seen on the last expansions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people don't like Pandas. Some people didn't like the story. Neither of those factor into how well or not it did endgame world content.<br />
<br />
An individual can dislike an expansion for one reason but still agree it did X well. Not liking MoP isn't necessarily the same thing as thinking a specific part of it was crap. MoP's world content in endgame is, from what I've seen, largely considered one of if not the best in WoW's history.<br />
<br />
Really, the only real concern people had with it was how it started off with dailies being the only way to get rep and thus raid gear and recipes, and how there were a few other factions that required Revered with another faction to even begin.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard gave them the same rewards WoD's factions do, IE toys, transmog, pets and mounts, no power items, there'd have been a lot less complaining about the dailies. People didn't appreciate the dailies because they were considered &quot;mandatory&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Correction. Idiots didn't appreciate the dailies since they only saw them as a source of gear and not as a progressive story at 90.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korrina</div><div class="date">2016-01-04, 07:42 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So it was really hard for me to decide because of all the factors.<br />
<br />
Here are my ratings on a 1-10 scale and a breakdown below:<br />
<br />
BC - 7<br />
Wrath- 5<br />
Cata - 6<br />
MoP - 9<br />
WoD - 9<br />
<br />
For BC - I loved the zone of Isle of Quel'danas, the lore, the story, the factions, and the communal spirit of each server unlocking things by doing the daily activities. I did feel the rewards were a little lacking, and catch up mechanics for alt gearing didn't exist. The other daily zones like Netherwing, Ogri'la, and Skettis were painful grinds that I hated spending so much time on for basically some mounts. If you had alts, you might as well forget having a life...<br />
<br />
For Wrath - Argent Tournament quickly became repetitive, and the spread out nature of the dailies was cool at first but then became a huge time sink. The rewards were more robust with all the different factions, but getting it all took loads of work for each faction. Still no real catch up mechanics for alt gearing.<br />
<br />
For Cata - The Molten Front had a bit of that community feel but not very strong. The unlocking of zones was cool, but the grind was long, and the rewards were limited. Still no catch up mechanics for alt gearing. So not very memorable for me.<br />
<br />
For MoP - Timeless Isle was a godsend for us altoholics. The catch up mechanics for gearing with the treasures was wonderful. The rares were cool even though I never got anything from them. The daily questing wasn't bad, nor even that mandatory unless you wanted the faction rewards past some basic catch up gear. Story wise and even zone wise, I felt it was a little lackluster though. I didn't feel interested in what was going on with the Timeless Isle. The faction rewards were just 'meh.'<br />
<br />
For WoD - Tanaan Jungle at least got me out of the stupid garrison time sink. But the the oil rewards kept sending me back! Lol. But as an endgame world zone I think it's pretty good mechanic and feature wise, though story wise it is really lacking once you unlock it. The catch up gearing mechanics for alts is great with so many rares and treasures, so that is a big deal for someone like me. The rewards for your dailies and rep grinding aren't super diverse, but they aren't terrible either.<br />
<br />
Overall, I value alt catch up, rewards, and story involvement. No endgame world content has yet to really win in all of those areas, but some have shined well in some of them individually. I also think Blizzard is on the path to getting to that range, and perhaps Legion will combine all of these aspects and more in a robust fashion that everyone can enjoy. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

LFR raiding + weekly raid quests guaranteed that everybody could do some raiding one way or another, even casual players<br />

Argent Tournament gave some stuff to do. getting tokens for pets and mounts and toys. also lots of achievements, and titles as well.<br />
Wintergrasp was fun as well<br />
<br />
MOP endgame was normal. giving some interesting stories beyond faction reputation grinds. Mop had best reputation gaining system. wish they would implement more factions with such rep grinding.<br />
Timeless Isle was good, but not good enough. it gave little lore and quests. adn there was nothing to do after obtaining some toys and pets.<br />
<br />
Cata endgame sucked. there was nothing to do beyond LFR. <br />
<br />
Vanilla had no endgame. you had to finish off everything that existed in-game probably since it's creating. all reputations were horribly hard to grind. and some hidden quests that required raids to do them or at least 5-10 man groups.<br />
<br />
Burning Crusade was normal. finishing off Isle of QUel'danas dailies was interesting at start. adn boring after u had finished whole phase<br />

<br />
WoD doesn't have that, the original reps in WoD really serve no meaning to the story and the only real rewards toys, pets and mounts. Same goes for Tanaan reps in a way as well.<br />
<br />
Wrath and cata had that model that was used in MoP as well, with the Argent Tournament unlocking new dailies, it felt like you were actually progressing through the tournament. And with the moltern front, getting a foothold in the firelands, and empowering it over time. These had meaning to the story, it gave you a reason to do it outside of 'gold or oil'. Hell even BC had it with Netherwing.<br />
<br />

WOTLK had the tournament which was pretty much one giant grind (accompanied by half-assed 5-boss raid)<br />
Cata, not sure, wasn't around for much those days, guess LFR gave end-game content a whole new witdth.<br />
MOP with Isle of Thunder and Timeless Isle added a lot of content during it's patches, also had a lot of other daily activities. Easilly my nr.1 pick.<br />

That's the most retarded thing I've read in a while.<br />
How about you let good players play with good players and let baddies to themselves, so they have an incentive to git gud and advance to play with good players as well?<br />

<br />
all matter of Timeless Isles and Tanaan Jungles is a terrible idea. You're making your dungeon and world content obsolete during the current expansion. Yeah it's easy gear and (ugh) dailies, but everything up to that point is meaningless world content-wise. You're shrinking the entire expansion literally into one zone.</div></div><hr />

I count &quot;Endgame wold content&quot; to be not just what they added in the last patch, but what is available in the last patch. Overall, I think I spent 6 months just grinding out reps, pet battles, hunting rares for toys/pets, everything. Kept me interested and rotated daily.

That's a no-go. No amount of great storytelling can repair this damage to me. And I did not find the story in the daily hubs that interesting to justify a high vote. MoP is #3 for me. Also timeless isle is a joke. It's boring as hell as long as you are not a pet/mount collector. Isle of Thunder was OK, but I found it not very impressive.<br />
<br />
My favorite is WotLK because we have had fun dailys at the launch (Sons of Hodir, Argentum dailys in Zul'Drak etc.), Wintergrasp etc. Then Argentum Tournament dailys. I liked them - I guess, people who hated jousting were just bad at it. :P <br />
<br />
But it's a very close tie to BC. I still give #1 to Wrath, because I had more alts in that expansion to play, and found lots to do on all of them, while raiding only with my main like in BC. So, Wrath goes first.</div></div><hr />

MoP probably had the most balanced mix of rewards/effort in world content. And plenty of it. There was plenty of reason to go out in the world in varying stages depending on where your character was in terms of personal progression.<br />
<br />
People voting WotLK before they read properly. WotLK had much but it certainly didn't have much of what we now call &quot;world content&quot;. And faction tabards killing the little it had.<br />
<br />
Assuming that I am correct in that the poll is about how much you had to do outside of raids/dungeons and how awarding it was/felt at the time, I'd rate<br />
MoP &gt; WotLK &gt; BC &gt; Cata&gt; WoD<br />
<br />
WoD can switch to third and BC fall to 4th if I'm kind and include getting followers for your garrison from quests. But right now I'm just maxing Treasure Hunters from the Inn anyway...<br />
<br />
MoP definitely was the closest Blizzard has been to keeping the world relevant in character progression without it taking too long and now when WoD utterly neutered that in favor of cosmetic garbage and nothing but apexis objectives (has to be the dullest shit... good god) I'm fairly sure Blizzard will go back to something a lot similar. People felt a lot of world content in MoP was &quot;mandatory&quot;. For Blizzard they need to realize that in this case, &quot;mandatory&quot; means REWARDING AND INCENTIVIZING. You either have rewarding solo content people do (good rewards and doesn't take so long its rewards are useless by the end) or you don't. If people don't feel like the rewards are good enough (&quot;mandatory&quot;), they simply won't do it. Or do it once. People think they know what they want until they got it. And with WoD that was &quot;no mandatory pre-raid items locked behind dailies&quot;.<br />
Burning Crusade was still infantile when it comes to world content, however since barrier of entry to endgame raids was so hard other than Karazhan, and we were used to getting very little gear rewards for long non-raid commitments, BC had quite &quot;a lot&quot; of world content because for a lot of people, doing a faction for like a month for one epic item was okay world content for their 70s. We would never accept that today.<br />
<br />
WotLK had many factions but once you got to friendly, hello dungeon farming. I think WotLK overall was saved by it's lore, LFD (to some extent) and how WotLK truly added a working reward scheme for people still unused to getting epics outside of raids (Emblems -&gt; Justice/Valor).<br />
<br />
Cataclysm also suffered from tabards, but didn't have a lot of world content relevant to 85s either, probably due to the Azeroth overhaul.<br />
<br />
And WoD is a melting-pot of good intentions and Blizzards tendency to go overboard. Listening to MoP feedback you'd be led to believe that people;<br />
Doesn't want pre-raid items from factions<br />
Doesn't want to do daily quests<br />
Doesn't want to cap currencies on a weekly basis<br />
Doesn't want high entry-levels into new raids<br />
Doesn't want to farm or grind<br />
<br />
So of course WoD's world content is shit. High production value and it looks amazing! But without proper rewards there's very little interest. People can pretend like content truly can stand alone without gear- or other character upgrades, but they are wrong. In general, content must have some type of reward that progresses a characters power for it to feel worth doing and fun. Imagine if the MoP factions only awarded cosmetic things, but was necessary to enter respective raids (Klaxxi -&gt; HoF etc)? People would EXPLODE. <br />
<br />
The rage directed at MoP dailies/factions was because we came out of Cataclysm so goddamn spoiled by tabards and LFR we forgot what kept us interested in the game at all.</div></div><hr />

Lots of factions with daily quests that rotated through various sets so you were doing different stuff each day, unique and fun spin on Reps with the friendship system, tons of story progression tied to reps, loads of pet battle quests (that actually gave good rewards unlike the 6.0 pet battle quests), tons of hidden lore scrolls that unlocked story time cutscenes to fill in the history of Pandaria, your own archaeology museum (though this did end up in WoD as well), personal farm that also served as a huge player hub, repeatable rare spawns that actually dropped worthwhile rewards, hidden treasures/rare spawn items that actually had unique effects (fishing lure, helpful wikky, item that granted your version of symbiosis, etc), and lastly a Brawler's Guild that felt like more than 10 minutes of dev time were spent on it. Timeless Isle was good too but not on its own, it needed more of the above mentioned things in addition to the sandbox.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tankbug</div><div class="date">2016-01-04, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">all matter of Timeless Isles and Tanaan Jungles is a terrible idea. You're making your dungeon and world content obsolete during the current expansion. Yeah it's easy gear and (ugh) dailies, but everything up to that point is meaningless world content-wise. You're shrinking the entire expansion literally into one zone.<br />
<br />
Well, what choice do you have?<br />
You get bored running the same dungeons, and now we have mythic, timewalker and challenge mode versions too. You don't want to farm these anymore than you already have. A zone's content is already obsolete the moment you're done doing quests or outlevel it. The klaxxi repgrind in MoP was a thing to keep me there, but it was a terrible chore, and I hope they never make content like that ever again. <br />
<br />
I think Tanaan is a good way of giving players a relaxed approach to end game content. You join and leave grps as you go, work towards individual goals, but with easy access to other players. The content is varied and the rewards are potentially very good. I don't think it matters that the first raids yield shittier rewards than this zone at this time, since they are introduced at the end of an expansion.</div></div><hr />

I loved the expansion, yes, I loved the raids, I loved the dungeons both normal and heroics and I loved the questing... But none of these are endgame world content. WoTLK had only dailies, and boring at that in the beginning, slightly better when the argent crusade came. But all of that felt to me like filler content not really worth my time and because of this I halted my subscription shortly after we cleared the ICC10HC and did most of the achievements that we could do with our small guild. The endgame world content wasn't too bad only because other content was so good and I had a guild to do it with.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind at all if that was the case in legion, but it will be harder to pull off, since the game looks better and better every expansion it takes longer to actually create vast amounts of content like WoTLK had (not to mention the new questing formula, which is nicer and smoother but takes more time to create too). We will have to end up with something like Tanaan again because it's more engaging than simple dailies in WoTLK.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: WTF people, WoTLK had almost no endgame world content to speak of! Still loved it though...<br />
<br />
endgame world content is not necessary content that you play from the last patch onwards. <br />
For me, it is content that you play at max level or near max level.<br />
If you look at it like that, then the Argent tournament and Isle of Thunder both fall into this category.<br />
<br />
MoP, followed by Wrath, were the expansions where I was the most outside of the main capital, doing things.<br />
<br />
By the way, MoP dailies were not bad if you decided to not have to do them all every single day. I picked one or 2 factions each time and did those quests. (did not have time for more than that anyway)<br />
What sucked was that all Valor items were locked behind them, making them obligatory for raiding people.<br />
I had loads of VP at a point in time, and nothing to spend it on, because that one perticular faction was not at the right rep yet.<br />
I prefer the daily system of MoP all day over the grindy character of the starting WoD faction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
5.0-5.2 I did dailies every day and even raised a few alts just to see the Alliance side of the questlines, or see the story again.<br />
<br />
5.3 I did the weekly enough to get the cosmetic rewards and pets, then I went back to 5.2 dailies.<br />
<br />
5.4 I did the Timeless Isle for a few weeks to get the pets and mounts, then I went back to doing 5.2 dailies, leveling another 8 alts to get Spirits of Harmony from the farm and catching and training -literally- every pet I could get as of MoP to the maximum level by doing the Pandaria tamer dailies.<br />
<br />
When your newest world content inspires such actions as getting 650 rare-quality battle pets to max level rather than playing it more than a few weeks, I'd say there's a sharp turn from earlier in the expansion.</div></div><hr />

What? You're mad that pvp is not balanced below max level? Who plays there? Who stays subbed only for level 19 or some random level 90 bracket in the bigger scale?<br />
And for max level how is removing one stun every 2 mins (with 30 sec exclusivving shared cd with pvp trinket) even more buffed than removing any cc every 2 mins plus extra damage trinket?<br />

<br />
First, I love higher end 5 man dungeons. The Troll Dungeons and End of Time dungeons were great.<br />
Second, Flying for all alts from the get go. Being able to level while gathering herbs, mining and doing archeology was a blast... and relaxing. Exactly what playing a video game should be.<br />
Lastly, Molten Front was good. Even though I never did the dailies everyday I appreciate that they changed things up so it was a little different each day.<br />
<br />
Cata was the first time I ever had multiple characters at max level... and I loved it. It also introduced new questing options for lower levels and new race / class combinations. Overall the amount of great content was superb without being overwhelming.<br />

Yes as I said, Argent Tournament was one of the things in the endgame world content of WoTLK, that doesn't change the fact that it wasn't really too engaging. All it did was offer some more daily quests and mediocre rewards for grinding them. Before AT there was almost nothing, after AT as well. You could argue that there was Wintergrasp, and while being fun it mostly didn't work since the amount of lag in it during the final defense phases was so horrible that spells took literally minutes to cast.<br />
<br />
With MoP though I can't say much, I missed all of it with the exception of beta testing so I have no clue how the endgame looked, Tanaan looked alright for me compared to WoTLK only grinding the Apexis seemed really weird. And as probably most people here I loved the Garrison for the first few days, then I wholeheartedly hated it for making WoW feel like a single player game.</div></div><hr />

On end game content, wotlk pants down best. Mount farming, rep farming, raiding that was interesting, dungeons that remained relevant for a long time and wintergrasp that was one of the more fun pvp zones. Oh and more importantly, a feeling of community.</div></div><hr />

I mean BC for about half it's life span the world content was just 'grind elementals for mats.' And when we did get daily hubs, all except Isle required you to complete a bunch of 5-man group quests just to unlock the solo quest content. WotLK was decent but I would say even Cata edges it out.. Tol Barad was a superior Wintergrasp, Molten Front was a superior Argent Tournament, and Therazane, well was on par with Sons of Hodir. <br />
<br />
And obviously the 'lolpandas' expac is the clear winner with entire quest campaigns that play out in max level daily hubs, though it was tarnished a bit by the adopting the 'here go grind stuff' model on Timewasting Isle. Even WoD probably deserves to be higher than the 'glory days' expacs.. it was a massive let down after MoP's world content but it was just as grindy as BC was while being slightly more rewarding at least.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, what end-game world content was there each cycle?<br />
Vanilla had Kazzak, Azuregos and the Nightmare Dragons, Silithus and EPL raid-reps you could grind/quest outdoors. I guess AQ Gates event might count?<br />
TBC had Kazzak and Doomwalker, Netherstorm, Shadowmoon Valley and Skettis/Ogrila rep grinds, and the Sunwell Island.<br />
Wrath had no world bosses, but it had a few reps to grind and the Argent Tournament which had 3 phases - the construction phase, the tournament phase and the kval'dir island phase.<br />
Cata had 5 Rare Elites, three or four &quot;recipe reps&quot; you could daily-grind and the firelands daily quest hub.<br />
MoP had 5 world bosses, the 5.0 daily grind, the 5.1 daily grind, the 5.2 daily grind and dinossaur bone grind, and the 5.3 rep grind.<br />
WoD had 4 world bosses, the garrison questline, the daily &quot;objectives&quot;, Tanaan Jungle's 3 rep grinds and a whole lot of rare/toy/pet hunting.<br />

Did it? All I can remember is grinding out those horrible fucking dailies for the Argent Tournament that eventually led to anxiety attacks anytime I went to the staging grounds. I literally can't pick up quests there without having an attack. Tunnel vision, nausea, cold sweat, dizzy and my hands start to shake. I have never had such a negative reaction to anything in my life. I would rather take the variety of daily quest hubs that BC had, thanks. I also liked grinding dungeon reps for keys to heroic dungeons that were super hard and could be worth the effort if you got the drop you needed from the final boss.<br />
<br />
But outside of AT, what really was there to do in WotLK in the world? Dailies? Well, you could slap on a tabard and get more rep that way, so I don't see how those limited dailies were worth the time or effort. The cooking daily? The fishing daily that could take you to god's know where? The endless &quot;joy&quot; of sons of hodir dailies? Nah, I was really not fond of any of it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tawk</div><div class="date">2016-01-04, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I would really like to see more end game content taking place in old zones, areas from Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms. That's where it all started. It feels disconnected to keep taking the fight (horde vs alliance) off to new areas. I mean, it's pretty much a necessity to have new zones to explore in each expansion, but it would be really nice to couple that with content in the old zones as well. It feels too much like the old and the new are separate worlds.<br />
<br />
Cataclysm did this well but at the same time Cata was not as well received. Perhaps it was too flashy, too fantastical and hard to get into. The underwater zone, the maelstrom zone. It was a bit over the top maybe, or maybe it just came at a bad time. With the end of the Lich King still fresh in everyone's memory, were the events of Cata too soon? One things for sure, even though many of the new zones were incorporated into the main continents they still weren't actually &quot;part&quot; of the world. You didn't accidentally run through them as a newbie. You only knew about them when it was time, then you viewed a cutscene and accessed them only through town portals. They felt closed off and separate from the old zones.<br />
<br />
WotLK was separate from the old zones as well, but I think part of the reason the expansion was so successful was because it touched on root Warcraft lore. A storyline that almost everyone was familiar with from Warcraft3. In a way, all the other WoW story arcs have felt like filler.<br />
<br />
I think the Legion story is a good gateway back to the root of Warcraft lore, but Blizz needs to find a way to incorporate the old and the new so it feels like one whole world again. I hope the focus on class fantasy helps accomplish this. I'm excited to quest into old zones in search of the artifact weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But I think people massively misunderstand the question asked in the poll. If you're talking about END GAME WORLD CONTENT; WotLK didn't have much of that at all. The only thing that comes to mind is the Argent Tournament dailies. And we can pretty much all agree those were a PITA for the most part (I liked some of the quests, but it was very grindy and monotone).<br />
You could make a case for the Ice Giant dailies or the Icecrown (zone) dailies and maybe even Shalozar basin dailies, but they were all not that special on the effort/reward scale and pretty grindy.<br />
<br />
TBC didn't have a whole lot either. Isle of Quel'danas was the biggest thing toward the end. You had some other daily zones like the apexis shelves and the netherwing isle which had some fun dailies<br />
<br />
Cataclysm I didn't really play, but I doubt it had very much either.<br />
<br />
MoP had probably some of the best end game content. You had a lot of dailies in different hubs that were somewhat rewarding; you had the farm; you had timeless isle and thunder isle.<br />
When it comes to: Stuff to do in the world at end game. MoP has got to be the best in that regard.<br />
<br />
WotLK will be my favorite expansion lore wise, zone wise, overal questing wise, raid and dungeon wise. But when it comes to end game content it really didn't offer much to &quot;just do&quot; that was fun and engaging.</div></div><hr />

I genuinely love how WotLK is on top of that poll. I loved WotLK and I think the game has gone downhill since. I'm going to try Legion but other than that I'm not really invigorated by any MMO. I love raiding and it seems WoW has the only decent raiding environment. Too bad.<br />

<br />
<br />
Don't be silly. Ulduar is regarded as the best raid instance in WoW. It had very diverse bosses; fun mechanics and a lot of lore.<br />
Icecrown is regarded as the second best raid I guess, making WotLK top contender for best expansion from a raiding PoV.<br />
<br />
Argent Tournament raid was bad. Naxx wasn't really bad IMO, people just hate on it because it was rehashed content (ironically by popular demand as very few, including me, never got to experience it in Vanilla). <br />
<br />
That said. WotLK was a superb expansion when it comes to overall experience (zones / quests / lore / raids). But the poll specifically mentions: &quot; endgame world content&quot;. That doesn't say &quot;endgame content&quot; but &quot;endgame WORLD content&quot; which to me means open world things to do at max level. For WotLK that pretty much meant Stormpeak giant dailies; Icecrown dailies and Argent Tournament dailies. There wasn't all that much else.<br />
That's why I disagree WOTLK was best with this kind of wording.<br />
<br />
<br />
Pandaria should be last on the list.<br />
<br />
To each his own I guess. <br />
IMO Pandaria was one of the better expansions as well. Especially considering endgame world content. You had a lot of diverse dailies, you had the farm which was entertaining and profitable without being extremely mandatory (like garrisons are); you had Timeless Isle at the end and Thunder Isle before that as major quest hubs.<br />
<br />
Raids in Pandaria were also quite decent (ToT and SoO were both really entertaining raids; the earlier ones a bit less so IMO). <br />
The biggest letdown in Pandaria for me personally was that the whole lore thing didn't appeal to me. I have nothing with Pandaren other than that the brewmaster was a nice easter egg in WC3.</div></div><hr />

<br />
World PvP<br />
<br />
Hellfire Fortifications: Even now if you're leveling through Hellfire Peninsula and come across similar lowbies or 70ish toons, you still duke it out. It's only when it gets real that they bring out the 100s to do the ganking because they don't like losing and not being able to accomplish their daily. Though its very little in present day, there are still people like that would duke it out with end level toons to stop them from ganking my lowbie toon. Tokens were worth something then.<br />
<br />
Zangramarsh Pillars: Two towers that you must hold control to gain fervor. Not many people did this because not many people wanted to look for where it was. Hint: It was in the center of the map and a little up north. It gave you tokens. Tokens to get gear or whatever you chose.<br />
<br />
Terrokar Forest: The Bone Wastes! Who could forget the 6 towers you had to take control of to have the bonus. It lived up to its name. World PvP was a lot of fun here.<br />
<br />
Blades Edge Mountains - Ogri'la Farm Rep and Arena spot: The dailies were unique as were the races found here. Learning some lore about Deathwing's other son and Rexxar and the half breeds. All cool stuff. The first talk of the Apex Crystals and the Ethereal that were looking to harvest it. The arena coliseum was a place to fool around and beat your friends butt or the best person on the server.<br />
<br />
Nagrand - Halaa: If you weren't helping in gaining control of or defending the post of Halaa, you weren't doing World PvP right. This lasted hours upon hours and guilds would rotate with other guilds in hours to keep the control of it.<br />
<br />
Shadowmoon Valley: The Netherwing Rep grind. That was something to look forward to. Getting the crop and the flying mounts felt like a sense of accomplishment considering flying was new at the time. The look of these dragons were something spectacular and still are. Even seeing them in the vengeful plated gear brings a tear to my eye.<br />
<br />
Isle of Quel'Danas: A quest hub, a raid area and dungeon as well as gank central depending on where you were and how far you were from the guards, this tiny island was a play for great mayhem. <br />
<br />
World Bosses of The Burning Crusade: Doomlord Kazzak in Throne of Kil'Jaeden and The Fel Reaver thing outside of Black Temple... those were some fun battles. Chaotic and insane. Not to mention if you were leveling in Hellfire, those Fel Reavers roaring behind you and being a skull at level 60 scared the bejesus out of you. You'd run for cover or be killed by it. <br />
<br />
Unlocking Heroic:The keys. IF you don't remember the damn keychain next to your bags, then you didn't play in The Burning Crusade. To EARN Heroic, you had to farm rep to honored. Once honored, you get the key to the dungeons that are located in that area by the vendor. Or you needed to be attuned to it like for Magister's Terrace. You couldn't waltz in heroic and be like &quot;Straight outta Azeroth and I'm NWNC (Newbie With No Clue).&quot; You had to learn as you go and you had to travel to the dungeons, using summoning stones. Heroics took a while to clear but the rewards felt earned. And it was a step closer to raiding.<br />
<br />
Raids:Karazhan was so interesting to me. I didn't get to see it until I was running it with the best guild on the server. I was frost, and didn't know jack about raiding, just I needed to kill things and do what they told me. Gruul's Lair. Magtheridon's Lair. Serpent Shrine. The Eye. Black Temple. Sunwell Plateau. All these were so much fun and all were unique.<br />
<br />
I did play the end of Vanilla, but The Burning Crusade did have a lot of content that needed to be earned. I think that's the best thing that came from the expansion because it led to further develop the future ones. It laid the foundation and will always be my favorite.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc4708223547</div><div class="date">2016-01-06, 09:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I chose TBC, because everything I managed felt like an accomplishment. Grinding out reputation to even access heroics, spending time getting the bone waste towers in groups to try and get spirit shards, attunement quests, Sky guard rep. IQD unlock (which was the basis for Isle of Thunder), Halaa. Getting anywhere and doing anything involved time investment and alot of effort, especially given the difficulty level of the game back then. And when you finally got there, you had the sense of achievement - you told everyone in guild and they were all really happy for you. You had payoff.<br />
<br />
Wrath had very little end game world content - it was either Argent Tournament, rep grinds or Wintergrasp. It was one of my favourite expansions, but the difficulty rating went waaay down and so did the sense of achievement.<br />
<br />
Cata... lets not even go there. <br />
<br />
MoP was an interesting one, because every major patch brought a significant amount of additional world content. Lions Landing, Throne of Thunder, Timeless Isle. It varied it up, gave you something different. My problem with it was purely down to time gating. Rather than having to spend a month to get something due to difficulty and requirements, MoP time gated everything. Things took 6+ weeks because it was dailies only, which gave a set amount of rep/day. For this, it comes second in my mind, as it artificially extended world content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Redecle</div><div class="date">2016-01-06, 03:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Can't really vote for one option only, they all had their ups and downs. <br />
Yeah overall WotLK was the best expansion, but was a combination of numerous things.<br />
Would be more beneficial to list at which point each world content feature was at it's peak.<br />
<br />
Questing, i'd actually have to go Cataclysm or MoP on this one, it's a really tight battle, BUT a notation here, this is purely end game questing as a game system, NOT dailies.<br />
<br />
Dailies, WoD, no doubt, cause there almost was none. The horrible nightmare of dailies that TBC started finally met it's end at WoD.<br />
Again a notation, story is not deciding factor here or with questing, it's merely the game system in itself.<br />
My hopes are the Legion will actually introduce a new DYNAMIC game system that replaces the daily system completely.<br />
The low point of dailies was during TBC and MoP. 5.1 Landfall hurrr and 'the everyones rose tinted nostalgia glasses', still more than enough bugged Ogri'la etc flying dailies during tbc. Horrible.<br />
<br />
Storytelling, was the best during WotLK, MoP coming close second. Story is something that's implemented in almost everything the game has that contains anything that happens in the quest lines to end raid bosses and between. In that WotLK had the most solid story. MoP drops to the second place mainly cause of the ending MoP had, Garrosh essentially was the downfall of MoP storytelling, so anticlimatic.<br />
<br />
Reputations, there's no comparison here, WotLK had and has the best reputation system till date. If at any point reputations combined with dailies can even be a good system, but at least there was the variation and inclusion of the tabards to the reputation system. WoD mob grind was the worst, TBC had an idea to combine dungeons and dailies, but WotLK did even that multiple times better, plus TBC era was the worst in the grind length, WoD had no options, but if time consumption required was the only factor TBC would have been the worst offender in this. <br />
<br />
Attunements, TBC was the only era if you exclude purely time gated content that has happened after it. I sort of support attunements thematically, they make sense for raids. They are an utmost horrible thing if you have to replace and carry new members to your level of content like Tier 4 recruits to Tier 6. So they are not convenient in any way, but thematically they have a point.<br />
For 5mans HCs, meaning the keys, NOPE, worth zero. They were a tool to separate &quot;bad&quot; players from doing heroics, but there's many better ways to do this.<br />
<br />
Timegating, there's no winners here. Anything that's artificially timegated is just a failure of game design. I get that such is made to protect players from themselves and burn out, but still options, choice and freedom is what makes MMOs great. If you are intending to do a &quot;time gating&quot; at least do it in a way that's not artificial, like the raid wing doors that magically open every couple weeks, how about making a wing end boss that takes couple of weeks to defeat until you can move onwards, tuned to the max and if you're really good enough you may proceed earlier.<br />
<br />
World PVP, at what point is this legimate, that's the real question. During vanilla before BGs, that's probably the peak point, mainly cause there was nothing else how to do this.<br />
It needs something more than any of the expansion have been able to provide to work. Most of the bigger scale things that have actually tried to create it Wintergrasp, Tol Barad, Ashran have all ended up being instanced, nothing more than a regular BG. Things that tried to create it in TBC the zone wide control points were nowhere near enough, Hellfire Peninsula is nothing more but a gank fest, there's not world &quot;pvp&quot;, people questing and leveling there don't attack and fight each other, they are leveling, people don't have time or incentive to do such thing. HP is just another bottle neck for level 70s, 80s, 90s, 100s, 110s to gank level 58-64. Only time actually meaningful wpvp happened was during release of those expansion when there was everyone leveling at the same time fighting over mobs, cause there literally weren't enough of them. Same thing that happened during Mount Hyjal at 80, but even at that point it's only the launch rush a week after.. leveling alts it's just max levels bored ganking lowbies. The only peak point in this was Halaa, it had something in it that people wanted other than measuring their own genital length. The world needs more things that need controlling that grant access to make wpvp work, fortresses, castles, access to waypoints to &quot;daily&quot; areas, but in order for all of this to work properly it needs forced realm faction balance. There's no way such system would work in the current balance, servers leaning 90% to one side, 10% of the players would either not have to care at all about the access to such things cause there's no way to gain control of those things. Good example was the previously mentioned Halaa during TBC, my server had one famous pvp warrior on horde side, who could pretty much single handedly control the entire town, he was there like 24/7 just pvping and he kept entire groups of pve players from capturing it, alone. Hence having one objective is not enough and having like 5% zone wide xp buff is not enough. Combining multiple objectives that create different needs to be fulfilled at different times. Ashran has this idea, but it's just not executed right.<br />
<br />
Flying, world content or not as it is. It's can be tied to it, like the netherwing eggs during TBC. I'm pro-flying, it's something a fantasy world needs. But when it comes to world content, it's about how to unlock it. Long quest chain has proven to be a good way as in TBC or multiple activity chain like WoD. BUT the netherwing eggs was a one time thing, when they redid that in MoP with the dragons, i was like NOT AGAIN. You can't just take the same idea and redo it in the next expansion, the quest chain needs to be different. That's a big NO. WoDs problem was that it was all over the place, there was no unifying theme, it was just devs saying we want you to do all the things available to see what we created. Half the things in there had NOTHING what so ever to do with flying, like the reputations.. what.. why..? There was no story behind it, just pam here's the steps do them.<br />
<br />
Scale, depends on the activity. Overall WotLK was the best here. Flying and world exploration pretty much means the whole world. &quot;Dailies&quot; i'd also say the whole world Azeroth and beyond, there's more options there than just one zone, it's somewhat tied to the theme, but let's say Legion invasion, can easily be tied to any existing zone. Smaller scale the Isle of Thunder is good, Timeless Isle was a little too hard to navigate, cause a lot of movement required trickery and jumping puzzles. Isle of Quel'danas was way too dense, you know all server is going to be there, on pvp server just doing your merely daily quests can turn in to hours cause the ganking grows in to such a huge problem it erases all other content there. It's not fun if you just want to log in and do your daily duties in 15 mins and that turns in to a 5 hour marathon on which faction can kill what spawn and when. It creates toxicity in the community, wpvp can exist, but it needs a reason other than &quot;hey you just stole my mob tag that i've been waiting for 15mins&quot; and the chain effect is ready, this just drives people to prefer playing alone in an empty server. No one stays calm if pushed enough and after that point it's just plain red bloody sight of blood and stress, hence the point of having fun and games ends and it becomes work. This combined with anonymity and the party of asshats is ready. You can go a life time in real life and maybe possibly find 2-4 people you just can't stand, and spend 15 minutes in an MMO and find 30 people you're ready to brutally torture murder and sit in jail for. That's just not right.. in any standard.<br />
<br />
World bosses, this one is a combination of MoP, WoD and TBC. It ranges from rares to bosses. Short spawns and long spawns. Having weekly lockouts and then just farmable. The difference has to come from the scaling. The standard type has been around since vanilla, weekly lockout, huge raid or two to defeat. Should be the best rewards. Then degrading in rewards from there, at least in gear rewards. Mounts etc can vary, some can definitely be farmable. Epicness is tied to the boss or character. Kazzak for example many think more epic than some WoD random boss in Tanaan, cause there's a clear story and reason for the boss. If you've done the Spires questlines in WoD Rukhmar makes a lot more sense as world boss.<br />
<br />
Professions, MoP just for the sake of the farm and fishing content. Otherwise this category is really underutilized by Blizzard so far. It's mostly just gathering professions. Last time this was properly utilized was vanilla and specially the server wide war effort during the gates of Ahn'Qiraj. Instead of artificially gating things just because of reasons, better way would be to make players use these tools together to unlock something, baseline resource management from Warcraft the RTS. Craft and acquire things to unlock further progress, things that could have been used for Quel'danas or Isle of Thunder progress. Isle of Thunder had a little bit of this, but Quel'danas was just do dailies enough until next phase unlock then do some more dailies.<br />
<br />
Archaeology and treasures, this is something that could be combined, the treasure hunting is fun and exciting, most of it is leveling content, but could be done as end game content just as ease.<br />
The current archaeology system is a gimmick and boring, combining these two might create a lot more fun experience. Instead of surveying around like a muppet, why not solve mini puzzles, find chests, collect fragments and keystones, maybe even do some jumping puzzles every once in a while, then combine keystones and fragments of different type to make the archaeology artifacts.<br />
<br />
Grinds, there can still be grinds, i'm sure some people enjoy them. Like the bones from dinos in MoP. Not really related to reps or anything else, but was a grind for a mount and stuff.<br />
Just moderate it more and have more variation, doing a grind is the easy way to implement things in to the game, everything can be made in to one. It's the things that differ from it that mean more.<br />
<br />
On the other side we can mention things that did NOT equal good world content. Some that have been mentioned already, the WoD reputations, TBC dailies, 5man HC keys, bottleneck wpvp that just creates ganking opportunities afterwards when the content is not current anymore (this out to be solved in Legion already since the zones can be done in whatever order you desire), more of the gimmick type dailies in Argent Tournament (the game engine is not made for these, they are fun and new once, after that annoyance, either re do the whole engine to handle different type of world physics or just give up on them.), more dailies to this list with 5.1 Landfall, garrisons ( had to mention it, this doesn't include having player housing, it can work, but it cannot be a thing that provides everything the player needs for free. Best way for player housing to work is for it to be purely cosmetical, it's a setting where people can create their own gameplay, rp, whatever.. There can be functions, the MoP farm for example is a cool idea, but if it entirely removes the need for one profession, well, might aswell remove the profession then.. You can't wait for NPCs to do mission for you, you do the missions and then go play house back in to the garrison with a wife and a family or something), what else.. Well it mostly revolves around the same one type, 'boring, static, repetitive, kill-same-15-wolves every (TBC, WotLK, Cata) or every (MoP) other day'. <br />
I just hope, oh i hope so much that in Legion the adventure mode whatever it is creates daily quests from a giant pool of information so that you never or at least not during a year period do one daily q twice. As that daily content can and should exist, something that regenerates itself, is dynamic in a sense that things evolve in the game world, situations change, dominance over areas change and the quest system adjust accordingly. New choices and multiple options can emerge on daily basis.</div></div><hr />

Let me clear to you what was in MoP:<br />
- Mr. timeless &quot;0,1% drop&quot; island without flying, same textures, mobs from other zones. Nothing new.<br />
- a good pet battle tournament<br />
- a medicore world boss<br />
- 20 quests on that island and endless, brainless farm<br />
- the monkey thing was good, I liked that.<br />
- and for how many months? yeah that is right. <br />
ToT island was far better but that was not the &quot;endgame&quot; content in MoP.</div></div><hr />

I loved WotLK and I think the game has gone downhill since. I'm going to try Legion but other than that I'm not really invigorated by any MMO. I love raiding and it seems WoW has the only decent raiding environment. Too bad.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping we get some time-walking raids to go with the dungeons. Ulduar, Nax, ICC... Would all be great. I'd love to see the BC and Classic ones closer to the way they felt back then as well.<br />

I love the idea of combining treasures with archaeology. Makes sense, story-wise, and would make both more fun. Why shouldn't the treasures have a story to go with the map? And archaeology have more rewards?<br />

I can't believe so many people voted for WOTLK. Wrath endgame world content means Argent Tournament, which was really awful.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the Argent Tournament. Then again, my main was a DK and I felt a connection to Tirion. I collected all the mounts, had fun with the dailies, and still wear the Argent Tourney tabard in WoD.<br />
<br />

I did read the question. I still liked Wrath the best. Followed closely by MoP.<br />
<br />
I liked the Argent Tournament dailies. I liked Hodir. I liked Wyrmrest Accord. Ebon Blade, Kalu-ak...I enjoyed them all. I don't have much of a taste for PvP but I even liked Wintergrasp. I really enjoyed the story &amp; lore incorporated into all of the rep grinds. I still enjoy these zones the most whenever leveling new toons as well. I get to Northrend as quickly as I can, and I stay as until I've completed Icecrown's story quests fully.<br />
<br />
Wintergrasp was my favorite PvP zone of all time. Was almost always a close finish, no matter who won. And tangible reward with the chance to claim a couple of badges in the ensuing raid. Several ways to engage in Wintergrasp too, between the tanks and walls and crowds or running around the edges... I actually looked forward to it on a regular basis, and haven't felt that way about any of the others.</div></div><hr />
