<br />
It has very honestly been a huge pleasure, and I thank you all for allowing 'Eyonix' to always remain a very fond memory as I move on.</div></div><hr />

But I wonder why?<br />
<br />
Too many idiots on the forums and he was fed up?<br />
Getting tired of Blizzard's bad story telling and letting Knaak have his way too much with lore?<br />
<br />
Probably something else entirely.<br />

<br />
There are many reasons for wanting to change a job. Sometimes you do it just because you stagnate at your current position. Sometimes you want to see the greener pastures. Sometimes you just wake up and want to do something completely different. Sometimes life changes making the current job an impossiblity. <br />
<br />
But if I were to wager a guess: <br />
<br />
Long work-days and lots of overtime, family-unfriendly work hours, heavy stress environment when 11 million geeks know the game better than you will devour you for any one single careless word, and probably not the best pay in the world. While the upsides obviously is being able to work on a labour of love amongst great colleagues, it is not a job you get old in unless you really enjoy abuse or the subject material. There are many reasons to NOT want to work for blizzard, the major part being that once your hobby becomes your job, it very often stops being fun. <br />
<br />
The fact that Eyonix stuck to it as long as he did, and as well as he did makes me want to /salute him. Truly one of the good guys. You will be missed!</div></div><hr />

Sorry, going to bed now but I can tell you what happened. Keep in mind it's been a while.<br />
<br />
<br />
It was indeed in Ulduar. Some high end guild finally killed Yogg Saron or Algalon world first. Then this guy complained on how easy the game has been become.<br />
<br />
Eyonix replied with (Copied from previous poster):<br />
<br />
&quot;Judging by your achievements, you have nothing to do now that someone who isn't you has finished Ulduar.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll try and find it tomorrow if nobody else found it before me. The best blue post imo I've seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To my oldest friend here at Blizzard, I wish you only the best of<br />
luck. It's been both a pleasure and an honor to work with you all<br />
these years. You've been a teacher, a champion, and a confidant. I owe<br />
much of where I am today to you, and I'm certain that I can never<br />
fully repay such a debt.<br />
<br />
You will be dearly missed around here, and remembered fondly.<br />
<br />
Just watch out for those buses.<br />

Good travels buddy.</div></div><hr />

This is what happened. :b Not the best analogy, but it works.<br />

<br />
[USER WAS BANNED FOR THIS POST]<br />
<br />
<br />
He didnt get banned because of disagreeing with the post, I would think he got banned due to the TONE of the post. Too many people forget that and then put their gut reactions out on a post without thinking about how they are saying what they want to say. <br />
<br />
And in reference to the person who spoke about &quot;freedom of speech&quot;. Sorry, there is no freedom of speech on forums run by someone else. Its their sandbox and if they want to pull posts due to content, its their right to pull posts due to content or ban people because of attitude. <br />
<br />
<br />
As for his leaving. I hope this isnt a tidings of what is to come..ie, a forboding of the decline of world of warcraft as a whole (i know, its still the most popular mmo). Im just saying i hope he left for more personal reasons then seeing an end to wow any time soon. Good luck in whatever you do and wherever you land.</div></div><hr />

Farewell Eyonix. It's sadder when one of the good guys is leaving.<br />

Freedom of speech doesn't exist on a message board anymore than it actually exists in the USA. The ones who think it does and get upset when it doesn't, are usually the exact same people you don't care to hear opinions from anyways.<br />

It was implied he (Fangtooth) got fired as it was the other CM's that made the post announcing his leave. Course nothing was ever said when Tyren left for whatever reason.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I imagine he's moving on literally for the reason he gave: to pursue another opportunity. There may not have been any room for him to move up at Blizzard for whatever reason, or perhaps some other company is willing to give him a fat raise in order to poach some one who has demonstrated a quality approach to such a tough job.<br />
<br />
People only tend to appreciate CMs when they give great news, but they're asked to wade through a LOT of crap to find the small nuggets of gold that they bring to the devs. The Tseric meltdown is a perfect example of what happens to CMs when they don't have a thick skin. The supply of trolls, flamers, and idiots is as limitless as the internet, so there's no way you can take stuff personally, even when they (the idiots, flamers, and trolls) try to make it personal.</div></div><hr />

actually i think that people should give feedback to boub. when people do not like his news posts (and say that) it might be helpful in some way. deleting people who provide feedback for just having a different opinion than you seems kind of lame to me.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">QQHater</div><div class="date">2010-04-03, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You do realize that he was the shaman CM for our review and didn't pass on the feedback that we gave and he straight up said that because the info wasn't passed on that we weren't really getting a review and that we would get one later (which we didn't). <br />
<br />
So yes, he was never involved in the actual class design, but he was the CM of the class (back when classes actually had CMs assigned to them) and he was supposed to pass the information on to the actual people who were in charge of class design. When he failed to do so a single troll told him to get hit by a bus. At which point he blew up at that one troll and never came back claiming that we were immature and several other things. He completely ignored all of the constructive posts (which easily outnumbered the QQ by 5 to 1) to focus on this SINGLE troll. So just because he didn't directly do the programming doesn't mean he didn't play a part in the whole thing.<br />
<br />
This is just a para-phrasing of everything that happened, but as I said, his handling of the situation left many shaman bitter and not sad to see him go. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What makes you think that the community gives very good and feasible solutions? And yes that guy was immature, like most of the wow community is.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how many of you were around then.Eyonix was inloved in a huge controversy in the shaman community when someone said that he should go get hit by a bus.<br />
Back then many old shammies were so unhappy with the state of shamans in wow(class forum looked pretty bad too) many decided to leave the class , the game even.</div></div><hr />

Hahah this made me laugh.. so many cluless people about the gaming industry.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is more likley he wanted to be more than what he was and wanted to progress up the blizzard ranks to a bigger more challenging role but maybe he kept falling short? maybe the positions were already filled? maybe someone offered him a job he just couldnt refuse.<br />
<br />
By the sounds of the replies from the other blue posters this was not a work related issue, my guess is someone offered him better pay, hours and possibly more responsability than he was getting at blizzard.<br />

Pretty sure his job entailed more than just posting on forums for the day same as GC</div></div><hr />

Regarding this post.<br />
<br />
It is inevitable in any business and mergers and joint ventures someone has to be seen to be in overall charge as it is just anarchy otherwise.<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure mike morhaime is not a guy who would let any tom dick and harry ruin what is technically his and a few others's franchise.<br />
<br />
Publishers i know are historically known to be utter bastards but I dont think this will happen here.<br />
<br />
<br />

There are so many possible explanations of why Eyonix left and the simplest explanation is usually the truth. He may have not been able to advance further in the company and he decided he wanted a fresh challenge.Some positions are just generally dead mans boots and it is the end of the line, maybe he was in one and just wanted something new.Cant blame him if some one else wanted him.</div></div><hr />

If you go deeper into the history of the forums, Eyonix was certainly a poor Community Manager - he acted like a child.<br />
<br />
He personally screwed over the shaman community throughout Vanilla (back when CM's presented feedback to the devs, he admittedly never shared the shaman feedback with them during our class review which impacted shaman development through Vanilla and into TBC) - because of how poor a CM he was, the shaman community basically said they hoped he got hit by a bus, banning wave ensues, bus shock occurs, more bans, etc. He essentially banned anyone that disagreed or said negative things about him.<br />
<br />
I'm personally glad to see him, FINALLY, get canned.</div></div><hr />

Exactly this. I hope he gets a job at EA, he'll fit right in there with those morons. I was there during bus shock days, while I didn't get my account forum banned for bus shock, I wish it was for that. Anyone who's been a shaman since Vanilla knew the pain, and aside from beta, that was where we were probably the most powerful, but gradually declined further and further as time went on. An entire class being neglected due to an immature little douche who can't handle some criticism and basically screwed over a portion of the players is not professional conduct.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Activision Blizzard quietly hits reset button<br />
The Santa Monica video game giant shuffles its senior management team, divides itself into four units and lays off about 15 workers.<br />
March 31, 2010|By Ben Fritz<br />
The nation's largest video game publisher has shuffled its senior management team and realigned its internal structure without telling investors or the public.<br />
<br />
As outlined in internal memos obtained by The Times, Santa Monica-based Activision Blizzard Inc. has divided itself into four units, with one focused on the military video game Call of Duty, another handling other company-owned titles such as Guitar Hero and the Tony Hawk skateboarding games, and a third handling licensed properties. Blizzard Entertainment, maker of the successful online game World of Warcraft, remains an independent unit.&quot;<br />

Really, seriously, honestly??? You've never read any of his replies to posters on the forums?? He's an immature little brat, and I have yet to see anyone say he was the role-model as to how community issues slash complaints should be handled.

<br />
<br />
Actually I've seen Eyonix post since beta and I have no idea how you think he was an immature little brat. The Eyonix I remember was a lot like Tseric and seemed to be the only 'real' CM out there right now. By real I mean someone who states what looks to be a true thought. I also enjoyed him poking fun at the tards who constantly complain about nerfs or buffs for -any- class over the years.<br />
<br />
And I doubt he was fired, I'd say he really did quit. If he was fired he wouldn't have made a post saying farewell. Look back to Tseric if you were around when he was canned. He lashed out at some retards QQ and he was canned for it. I Believe it was Drysc who made a post a day later stating he had gone onto greener pastures.<br />
<br />
PS Kotick has always had 'control' over Blizzard. Morhaime simply reports to someone else who reports to him now. <br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: Although if I were a Shaman who played in Vanilla I would probably hate him. He did do bad when it came to shammys. -Really- bad.</div></div><hr />

Eh, you work on a game from the start, you do insanely well, things get huge and you see the evolution of the game go way beyond your expectations... but it got so big and set the mark for everything else, and it's not necessarily what you wanted. <br />
<br />
I'm not going to pretend I know what goes on in Eyonix's mind, something tells me WoW isn't what he wanted it to be anymore though. We've gone way past the &quot;raid or die&quot; philosophy, and you gotta remember he came from the hardcore EQ raiding scene. At some point, you just want to do something else too, so you go your separate way.</div></div><hr />

The Lead CM, whether you like it or not, has a close and personal relationship with the development of the game...atleast thats probably how it WAS at some point, and became less and less so. He likely began his job able to have two way conversations with development and it slowly devolved to him doing no more than making canned speeches / blue posts written for him, his input simply ignored.<br />
<br />
There is no &quot;evidence&quot; of drama on the official forums, because duh, that is public. He (like any other PR person) has written contracts that say that can't say certain things, likely for X number of years after his departure from blizzard.<br />
<br />
Sure, it is just as likely that there is no bad blood...... but I would gander to say that there is, just by probability.<br />
<br />
HOPEFULLY he will move on to be a positive influence on another team, doing, whatever...but really I never liked the guy because he was very much an &quot;old school&quot; guy, but for all the wrong reasons.<br />
<br />
This is just my OPINION though. so meh.</div></div><hr />

Unless you are secretly Eyonix, you're talking about of your ass. Your argument is 100% based on speculation about how you THINK the environment at Blizzard changed, which you have zero evidence to support. Heres a simpler explaination: What he said in his post was exactly what he meant to say. He had some good times, another opportunity arose, and he left to pursue it.<br />

So you think that &quot;nothing&quot; has changed at blizzard ? So you think that everything they say on their official forums is the absolute truth with no strings attached ?<br />
<br />
Lets just ignore the many many contradicting blue posts that seem to want to rewrite their own history, ( ex: &quot;We believe hybrids should be at a certain large % under 'pure' classes &quot;... 1 year later &quot;We have always believed a hybrid in a certain spec should be within a small % of a 'pure' class &quot; ). And god forbid you throw up a &quot;comparison&quot; thread of contradicting statements, or a post-deletion + forum ban is coming your way. (( I was druid from release to throughout BC, we had a lot to &quot;discuss&quot; )).<br />
<br />
You are really so naive to think that NOTHING absolutely NOTHING has changed in blizzard's process / mindset / development team ? You are really so naive to think that a Corporate buyout changed nothing ? That having 10 million more subscribers than what you had 4 years ago would do NOTHING to your thought process / course of business ? Come on.<br />
<br />
Blizzard does not live in a vacuum. What I am speculating is yes, a negative outlook, but ffs, I am 100% positive that things are &quot;different&quot; at blizzard and that Eyonix's decision to leave was based upon that change and/or his own.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I don't care what you think, WoW IS on a downhill tread. This isn't my opinion, this isn't something that I personally feel but is just the way it is. Subscription numbers are dipping even more then they did in Vanilla or TBC before an expansion comes out. It is to be expected because people do get bored playing the same game over and over but come back for the expansion. The problem is, the numbers that are dropping is far too many and not as many are coming back as they should. It will jump up again for Cataclysm and WoW will have for a while a good playerbase number but ...you are blind if you can't see it is slowly declining. The only thing keep it from having a huge drop off is that alot of gamers have become tainted by the &quot;Any game except MMO is boring&quot; virus. There is no other MMO out there worth playing right now...but mark my word...something will come along and it might not be a WoW killer per se...but it will diminish the population and with that...the game will change. I think both Star Wars and Final Fantasy's mmo have a good chance at taking the top MMO spot within the next couple years. Star Wars and Final Fantasy both have MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better mythology, lore and storyline settings...plus their fanbase is alot bigger then the fanbase of Warcraft. Majority of people only played WoW because it was/is popular...hardly anyone got into it because they liked Warcraft. And even if they did, the one storyline they cared about...has now been resolved.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He lead me to not distrust CMs, per se, but realize that they're just there to stir the pot and really are not any sort of meaningful conduit into design. <br />
<br />
I remember him referring to priests having immunities, for instance, and he got skewered on that point. <br />
<br />
So for all I know he would go back to some review meeting where they parse CM input and be an articulate boon to the priest class, but based on what little he vomited onto the priest forums I'll just wonder why anyone thinks he mattered at all to the game!<br />

Nah, he was just around since Vanilla WoW...so people over exaggerate how awesome he was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So you are excluding other people's anecdotal evidence while prioritizing evidence that reinforces your stance. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't my opinion, this isn't something that I personally feel but is just the way it is. <br />
<br />
Everything you perceive forms an opinion. You don't have to write &quot;In my opinion...&quot; because everything you profess is your opinion. Humans are fundamentally incapable of objectivity.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Subscription numbers are dipping even more then they did in Vanilla or TBC before an expansion comes out. It is to be expected because people do get bored playing the same game over and over but come back for the expansion. The problem is, the numbers that are dropping is far too many and not as many are coming back as they should. <br />
<br />
Please provide subscription evidence. Then pause while we laugh at your parrotted sources that can't possibly know this. The only source that is anywhere near valid is Blizzard, and according to them their subscriptions are holding fast. You are vastly underestimating how many people (according to them) would keep an account active while not playing. I don't pretend to know this information, because I feel any outside source will be low and Blizzard will be high in their count.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It will jump up again for Cataclysm and WoW will have for a while a good playerbase number but ...you are blind if you can't see it is slowly declining. <br />
<br />
There are too many assumptions in this statement to take seriously. What if there was a console version of WoW? What if they came out with a supplemental content version that required no previous account? Then you'd change your story from &quot;wow is on a decline&quot; to restate that it's on the very typical pre-expansion, summertime slump for majority of their playerbase, as usual. Zzz.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The only thing keep it from having a huge drop off is that alot of gamers have become tainted by the &quot;Any game except MMO is boring&quot; virus. There is no other MMO out there worth playing right now...but mark my word...something will come along and it might not be a WoW killer per se...but it will diminish the population and with that...the game will change.<br />
<br />
Is it supposed to be revelatory that people who've spent years on a game continue playing it? That $15 a month is what a lot of people pay for part of their lunch in one day? People still play everquest, wow will be around for a very, very, very long time. <br />
<br />
One bit you're not mentioning is how much better a MMO gets when the subscription base starts to decline. Suddenly all of the perks that were impossible are added. Populations balance out as servers merge. The status quo game that will come out will modify wow as you mention, to make it more like the game you'd have to start over to play, making it harder to leave. Guild housing? Monthly tournaments? Customizable graphics? Player-run shops? 100x as many / interesting craftables? Tons of maps and gametypes for battlegrounds? I guarantee you will see one or more of these before wow is done, but only when they have to add them to keep players playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think both Star Wars and Final Fantasy's mmo have a good chance at taking the top MMO spot within the next couple years. Star Wars and Final Fantasy both have MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH MUCH better mythology, lore and storyline settings...plus their fanbase is alot bigger then the fanbase of Warcraft. Majority of people only played WoW because it was/is popular...hardly anyone got into it because they liked Warcraft. And even if they did, the one storyline they cared about...has now been resolved. <br />
<br />
<br />
You are grossly overestimating people's interest in Star Wars. The folks who really care about it are on the older end of the gamer spectrum (as we were little kids when the original trilogy was around) and if you think the newer 3 movies have &quot;much better mythology, lore and storyline&quot; that's your - once again - opinion. <br />
<br />
Final Fantasy will have potential. FFXIII had a good tanking setup, but the game was terrible and received a lot of backlash as being the worst FFantasy game. Problem is that to keep their core playerbase happy it has to be similar to their current MMO, but to expand anywhere near wow killer it has to remove the hardcore asian-accepted grinding and timesinks. <br />
<br />
WoW doesn't have the concept of &quot;camping a mob&quot; or setting up an &quot;exp camp&quot; like EQ and FFonline had. You would sit in one spot for hours grinding mobs in a group. It was hard / time consuming to find a group if you weren't one of the darling classes or had 5 other friends to sit around and do nothing. FFonline and EQ2 were even harder on pugs or casuals because of the combo system. So I guarantee that game will be zero threat to the &quot;play for an hour at lunch&quot; audience that wow has on lockdown. Have fun fishing at nighttime in a small window, and doing that for weeks for a tiny chance at a mediocre reward.<br />
<br />
<br />
So yeah, your judgement is suspect for even blabbing about this in a goodbye thread to a CM. I'm confident that your anecdote is not remarkable regarding the state of WoW.</div></div><hr />

You really think that dealing with the insanity of the WoW forums is a dream job? I'm shocked he was able to keep it up for so long. Also, I'm sure they don't make as much money as they're worth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's been a CM for 6 years, it's more than likely he just got tired of it and wants to do something else. I can hardly stand the forums for 15 minutes, I can't imagine what it would be like to have to moderate them full-time for that long. Like the above poster said, working in the spotlight for Blizzard is a networking dream-- I'm sure he has had many job offers over the years.</div></div><hr />

I was banned from the wow.com forums for posting my opinion on Eyonix leaving (Which mainly was me responding to specific Shaman players and calling them idiots, so I suppose the ban was warranted..). As someone who used to actively play a Shaman, I personally do not and will not miss Eyonix. Neither should other Shaman players, especially long-time players.<br />

All the info you need, if you actually &quot;need&quot; info as to why you should not support Eyonix (As a Shaman player).</div></div><hr />
