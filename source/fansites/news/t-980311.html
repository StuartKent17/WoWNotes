Continued from part two: Well of Eternity.<br />
<br />
Hour of Twilight<br />
<br />
Having shattered the infinite dragonflight and recovered the fabled Dragon Soul, Thrall and his allies must now journey to Wyrmrest Temple and rendezvous with the green, blue, red, and bronze dragonflights. Reaching their destination will be an arduous endeavor: the Twilight's Hammer has amassed its forces near the temple, determined to intercept the Dragon Soul at any cost.<br />
<br />
The final stage in this series of dungeons is set in the present-day Dragonblight, now under a full invasion by the Twilight's Hammer. Players must escort Thrall and the Dragon Soul safely to Wyrmrest Temple, where the assault on Deathwing is to commence. But the Twilight's Hammer forces are numerous, and their leadership remains strong. Those attacking the temple are commanded by a man known very well for the strength of will he's offered Alliance citizens. Now with his own will broken, he preaches only Deathwing's cataclysmic vision for all life on Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Excerpts from the Dungeon Journal<br />
<br />
Arcurion: Horde and Alliance assaults against the Twilight's Hammer have slaughtered many of the cult's fearsome elemental ascendants. One exception is Arcurion, a formidable water ascendant tasked to slay Thrall and retrieve the Dragon Soul. Should this twisted elemental being succeed, nothing will be able to stop Deathwing from ushering in the Hour of Twilight.<br />
<br />
Asira Dawnslayer: Former blade-for-hire Asira Sunbright was initially leery of working for the Twilight's Hammer, but the cult's generous payments quickly won her over. In time, she succumbed to the corruptive influence of her dark employers, even going so far as to take on the name Dawnslayer. As one of the cult's deadliest assassins, Asira has been called upon to exterminate Thrall and his comrades.<br />
<br />
Archbishop Benedictus: Archbishop Benedictus is the revered leader of the Church of the Holy Light. For years, his wise guidance has been instrumental in seeing humanity through bleak times. Yet beneath his apparent benevolence lies the shocking truth that Benedictus has pledged himself to the eradication of all life on Azeroth through the agency of his dark master... Deathwing.<br />
<br />
This world has already lost too many good people. While inhabitants of Azeroth have been betrayed by their most trusted leaders and advisors, others have betrayed their own ideals and morals in search of a higher, albeit calamitous, cause. The time has come. You must act on behalf of the Dragon Aspects as a minister of war, battling the twisted future echoes of today's greatest leaders, subverting ancient armies of the Highborne and Burning Legion, and risking your very life to make certain the Twilight's Hammer doesn't intercept Thrall's most coveted possession. Your mission will take you beyond the bounds of time. You'll see Deathwing's preferred outcome for Azeroth -- an outcome through which even he won't survive. You'll witness the event that began the first Sundering of the world, 10,000 years prior to the Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
All of this you'll do to bring back into existence what would appear to be a simple disk… an object all but forgotten over the ages. This is the beginning of the last stand against Deathwing.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned for a preview of the patch 4.3 raid: Dragon Soul.<br />
<br />

I like it too ... but note, that this Dragonblight is so post to happened WHEN he is making the DEMON SOUL so it cannot be re-used, unless they went forward in time and made it and re-used it in wotlk ..... <br />

Must stop watching back to the future<br />

I don't wanna jinx it but it looks like we're safe. Which is a good thing, because that was some of the dumbest shit concocted since raptor armies if it were true.<br />

<br />
Maybe I didn't make my point clear. What I meant to say was that this is a good time to go back to something from a previous xpac, but people are tired of &quot;rehashed&quot; content because there was naxx 2.0, onyxia 2.0, onyxia 3.0 and nefarian 2.0 all in the same fight, then the Zandalari rehash. What they're doing now: Good, makes perfect sense. What they did before, more or less bad because it was convient for them to increase health pools, damage and tweak a couple of mechanics instead of coming up with fresh new content.</div></div><hr />

Naxx10/25? Yes. Reused.<br />

We still might see him in the raid. We aren't killing Azshara or Mannoroth, so why not Benedictus?<br />
<br />
Very excited though for 4.3 now. :D<br />
<br />
We might even see the preview for the raid today! Hopefully. And maybe a new tier. :)<br />
<br />
Also very glad that all three instances aren't long, but nice, short, to the point, and very cool looking.<br />
<br />
Definitely think that is how the raid is going to be, they are going to make the encounters really cool, the raid really cool looking, and not too long.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mybuddyphil</div><div class="date">2011-09-19, 10:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think that giving players reasons to revisit old zones would breathe more life into the game than creating new zones. Giving old zones relevance means more traffic through areas where players are also leveling, doing dailies, and max-level dungeons in the area, bringing back (to an extent) world PvP, as well as simply (to me), making more sense. Although ilvl will continue to rise, player max level will continue to rise, I'd like to think of past bosses to still be powerful, regardless of the displayed level of your character. For example, Ragnaros was a lvl 60 raid boss, but is now a challenge at lvl 85. Although Al'Akir was a T11 boss, and Ragnaros was a T12 boss, they're &quot;equal&quot; in terms of lore for their own respective realms (TotFW and Firelands). I don't know if this is worded properly, but it makes sense to me.</div></div><hr />

How powerful can the Aspects be if they constantly have squatters living in the Temple? lol O.oSeriously though, are the books considered canon or not?<br />

<br />
if you have read everything that has been put out, you make your way from getting the dragon soul(the 2nd 5man) to the wyrmrest temple. so it starts there, its not like you can magically teleport..........<br />
<br />
but really blizzard is trying to make a continued storyline where these traveling these 3 instances happen right after another. so as soon as you get the dragon soul, you make your way to wyrmrest, thus making sense to start in CoT because thats where you already are</div></div><hr />

Thrall: Twilight of the Aspects takes place before 4.2, so they've had months to recover from their loss at Wyrmrest. Not to mention that all of Twilight's Hammer was not destroyed in this final battle. The description of the raid in interviews also seems to indicate that Deathwing, during the raid, realizes that he is slowly losing more and more forces and they cannot last for long.<br />
<br />
Also: Only 1 time was the temple ever taken over.<br />
<br />
Nothing they said has gone against any lore, so I have no idea what you're talking about. Perhaps you just don't understand something.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, it is weird. There have been so many patches since 4.2 and yet in none of them have classes been overhauled.... It's an outrage! oh wait...</div></div><hr />

At the end of an expansion full of new models, zones, doodads, environments, instances, etc., revisiting Dragonblight would have been interesting. At the end of Catacylsm, you just shake your head and say, &quot;Seriously, your idea of an instance is plain old DB with one tentacle monster added?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Omg, this is not new, it's the same place where we were last year!! That expansion is getting worst every patch... 4.0-Reused Deadmines and Shadowfang. Reused Onyxia-Nefarian. Even reused Gamon. <br />
4.1-Reused Zulaman, reused Zulgurub. <br />
4.2-Reused Ragnaros. <br />
4.3-Reused Dragonblight, reusing Cavern of Times, and reusing the world leaders (sylvanas, jaina, tyrande...) Even the stupid transmogrification feature is reusing sets!<br />
<br />
At that point, we can expect for the next expansion a revamped Archavon, a missed son of malygos who hidded at the botton of some iceberg, and of course another slim Kel'thuzad (you only have to put his bones with water and voilà!). No new characters/bosses... (i mean big chars/bosses, endbosses), no new places... the same plots again and again... it's becoming very boring...<br />
<br />
Damn blizzard. Where are your inspiration and creativity when you need them? I would like to think that your design team workers are fulltime busy with Diablo3 and Heart of the Swarm development, because another wow expansion like this piece of sh!t and wow is dead. What a shame.</div></div><hr />
