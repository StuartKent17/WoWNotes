Flasks are fairly simple in Cataclysm, your only choice is a +300 stat boost in one stat and the addition of Cauldron of Battle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92643/cauldron-of-battle/) and Big Cauldron of Battle (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/92688/big-cauldron-of-battle/) will make your life even more easier in raids. <br />

Transmutations<br />
A few interesting changes were made to Transmutations in Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
<br />
There's only one type of Meta Gem now, and it's now created with Uncommon quality gems.<br />
You can create Rare gems by crafting herbs + Uncommon gems.<br />
Volatile Life (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52329/volatile-life/) can be randomly transmuted into any other kind of Volatile (http://db.mmo-champion.com/items/7/10/?level=83&amp;quality=1) element. <br />

Potions<br />
The regular stats, healing, and mana potions are here but you also get a couple of fun/utility potions that you might be able to sell for a good price. <br />

The Elemental Invasion<br />
After the appearance of Twilight's Hammer agents in Orgrimmar and Stormwind City, Azeroth's defenders swiftly thwarted the cult's bid to destroy the two capitals. Yet these victories have done little to soothe fears over Azeroth's calamitous state. Earthquakes continue shaking the world with greater frequency than ever before. Wayward fire spirits have engulfed Orgrimmar, threatening to reduce the proud Horde capital to ash. Across the Great Sea, a sudden influx of earth spirits has rocked the foundations of Ironforge, pushing the once-indomitable dwarven bastion to the brink of collapse.<br />
<br />
Even so, a glimmer of hope has come in the form of ancient tablets recovered in Northrend. These mysterious artifacts are believed to hold clues concerning Azeroth's tormented elementals -- a claim that can only be validated once the artifacts are delivered safely from the northern continent. The gifted shaman Thrall has also begun his own efforts to shed light on the disasters befalling the world. Of great concern, however, is whether anything will be left of Orgrimmar and Ironforge by the time answers are found....<br />
<br />
The events leading up to Cataclysm are underway, and the disturbances will only become more severe as the weeks pass. Pay close attention to your faction leaders, Thrall and Varian, and be on the lookout for unfamiliar faces gathering on the city streets. This one-time-only series of events features all-new quests and multiple stages of dire happenings, so stay vigilant!<br />

Optimized Talent Builds<br />
You are missing the point of that quote. It is not &quot;players shouldn't have choices,&quot; as many of you are inferring. It's that &quot;there should be more thought on the part of the designers for how various abilities are supposed to be used and those roles should be more apparent to players.&quot;<br />
<br />
There has never really been a time in the game when you could just do whatever you wanted with your class and be equally effective. Then, as now, smart players doing a lot of homework would figure out the most optimized way to play. You can choose to follow their recommendations, try to find an even more optimized way to play, or just do your own thing because that's more enjoyable for you, knowing that you may pay the price of being less optimized. <br />
<br />
[...] That was my point in my post above though. That sense of exploration and discovery you are missing wasn't lost as a result of anything we did. You could make an excellent or terrible talent tree before and you can still do so now. What changed is that the community became a lot more sophisticated, which isn't that surprising in a game that's 6-years old now. These days there are numerous fansites, simulators, videos, mods and other tools, all created by the community, to optimize your gameplay. There have always been some, but there are more today, they are more sophisticated, and more players know about them.

<br />
&quot;Creative use of game mechanics<br />
I don't disagree with that. We don't like to reflexively stomp out on creative use of game mechanics just because they were unexpected. (This is particularly true of encounters, where we will generally just accept if players come up with strategies we didn't anticipate, so long as they don't trivialize the intended challenge.)<br />
<br />
It comes down to whether we think the playstyle violates what we are trying to do with the class.<br />
<br />
Imagine there was a rogue build that centered around only using Deadly Throw and Fan of Knives to make an effective ranged dps class. Imagine this rotation was generally accepted to do 5% more dps than the traditional melee rogue. That's the kind of thing we would likely break. That's not because we're mean jerks. It's because we think the game might break down: rogue itemization would be in a weird place, encounters might not work with so many characters at range, most importantly those players who enjoy playing rogues because of the iconic lightly-armored melee fighter are now encouraged to play something completely different that they might not enjoy.<br />
<br />
There are no hard and fast rules on this sort of thing. It's all judgement calls on the part of the designers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/127075/blood-tanking-instructions))<br />
<br />
Rotations complexity<br />
I agree with that too. We set out to make the Feral and Protection paladin rotations more complex in Cataclysm. I know that some of you feel that isn't the case, but we'll just have to agree to disagree about that. Both specs now have some opportunities to screw up, which in turn makes players who pull off the rotation with finesse better tanks and worthy of the accolades they receive, rather than just being lucky that they picked the right class.

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..deathknight) / Beta Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1116-Death-Knight-Cataclysm))<br />
Diseaseless Blood<br />
In the case of &quot;diseaseless Blood,&quot; we don't have a problem if tanks choose to sacrifice some of their threat generation for a simpler rotation or other benefits. It doesn't bother us unless ignoring diseases becomes the only reasonable way to play (and with Outbreak available in Cataclysm, applying diseases is even easier). When dps specs were ignoring diseases, we made changes, because the whole DK rotation was based on applying diseases. That's true to a much lesser extent for tanks, but we try to have pretty simple rotation for tanks anyway because they have a lot of other things to worry about and are often having to deal with very dynamic situations compared to what a PvE dps DK might be doing.

It will be the new way to gold farming. Just take 1 potion and kill as much mobs as possible. You should be able to kill atleast 1mob per minute.<br />

It will be the new way to gold farming. Just take 1 potion and kill as much mobs as possible. You should be able to kill atleast 1mob per minute.<br />
So that's 240g, 517 embersilk and 9 volitile elements.<br />
Seems like a good deal to me especially is you are a tailor.<br />

I'm not sure about this, but I remember reading somewhere that the effect wears off as soon as you loot one such chest.</div></div><hr />

Bind on Pickup without an Alchemy requirement (at the moment) so I assume anyone can use it, but you have to be an Alchemist in the first place in order to make it.</div></div><hr />

Current speculation is that the vendor purchase price is 100g (sell back price is 25g according to cata.wowhead.com). That almost assures that it's either an alchemy vendor or a faction rep purchase. Of course, the 100g is a drop in the bucket compared to the 24,000g material purchase. That being said, neither the recipe nor the Sands of Time nor the Pyrium-Laced Crystalline Vial are available for purchase on the Cata beta realms yet.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">greyghost</div><div class="date">2010-11-09, 12:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That bit there discussed by Ghostcrawler titled &quot;Creative use of game mechanics&quot; is one of the big reasons why I keep coming back to WoW after testing out other games. <br />
<br />
One large MMO release in the last year that was billed to be a WoW-killer had a very bad case of &quot;creative game mechanic use&quot; that wound up severely disadvantaging healers being able to gear, as tanks in that game -- to this day -- would simply take everything above leather-strength gear, including the chainmail armor that's strictly intended for the healer/support classes. The reason this was, was because the tanks had 2 or 3 custom abilities that scaled insanely with spellpower, so they would take the healer's gear for the sake of being able to kill things better than anything else in the game. It made them frightfully overpowered in PvP, and rendered them with sub-par evasion, making them even more of a nightmare to heal up. Stats on gear were such that eventually the Rogue equivalent in that game were ideal tanks for the lone endgame instance...... And the game designers did nothing to fix it. People who attempted to play the game 'normally' were left in the dust as the people who abused a flavorless abused stat system did whatever they wanted in PvE and PvP. <br />
<br />
Of course, this game has gone from 200,000 active subscribers in NA to estimated less than 50,000.<br />
<br />
Anyways, this rant is because I hope everyone will realize that it is in fact a hundred times more fun to play a game where classes played in a way they're intended to be played that pan out to be at least of some equal worth in endgame activites, VS a game where half of the players are 2 certaian classes that are abusing broken mechanics to make the game unplayable for everyone else. Keep that in mind when you feel compelled to gripe about WoW being unbalanced, when the worst thing that's ever happened in terms of gratuitous gearstacking was ArPen.</div></div><hr />

Yet these victories have done little to soothe fears over Azeroth's calamitous state. Earthquakes continue shaking the world with greater frequency than ever before. Wayward fire spirits have engulfed Orgrimmar, threatening to reduce the proud Horde capital to ash. Across the Great Sea, a sudden influx of earth spirits has rocked the foundations of Ironforge, pushing the once-indomitable dwarven bastion to the brink of collapse.<br />
<br />
Even so, a glimmer of hope has come in the form of ancient tablets recovered in Northrend. These mysterious artifacts are believed to hold clues concerning Azeroth's tormented elementals -- a claim that can only be validated once the artifacts are delivered safely from the northern continent. The gifted shaman Thrall has also begun his own efforts to shed light on the disasters befalling the world. Of great concern, however, is whether anything will be left of Orgrimmar and Ironforge by the time answers are found....<br />
<br />
The events leading up to Cataclysm are underway, and the disturbances will only become more severe as the weeks pass. Pay close attention to your faction leaders, Thrall and Varian, and be on the lookout for unfamiliar faces gathering on the city streets. This one-time-only series of events features all-new quests and multiple stages of dire happenings, so stay vigilant!&quot;<br />

but for fights where higher healthpools will cause healer issues... Hmm... :)<br />
<br />
The only time where higher tank health pools put healer mana at risk is if the encounter has any % of max HP attack abilities and they'd have to happen often in that encounter. Since those are super-rare, most of the time it's a boon for tanks to have more health. Yes, spike is *supposed* to mostly be gone, but it isn't completely (I've seen plenty of spike damage on tanks in beta), but even when there isn't spike, it's more time for tank healers to save mana by not having to worry about you for X more time or freeing them up for a sec to help the raid if they can manage the mana.</div></div><hr />

If it takes you longer to read that than it does to get from Stormwind to Ironforge - even if you ARE portalling, then yes, you really are a slow reader.<br />
<br />
Also, one of the quests has an item with a 5 second cooldown that you have to use 20 times, so min time to do that one quest is 100 seconds.<br />

<br />
That is because the item to use the flying machine could be traded. This can not. It says Bind on Pickup, so as soon as an alchemist makes it, it is bound to them. So effectively, the minimum level of alchemy that can use it is the minimum to make it. Plus, adding something like &quot;requires 500 alchemy skill to ride&quot; would probably do weird things since it is a passenger mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong. Having a higher health pool at the expense of mitigation/avoidance makes you something me and my fellow healers used to call a &quot;mana sponge&quot;. Mana sponges make a healer's life hell, and will often cause wipes because we dump so much mana healing you that we go OOM quicker than if you had balanced your stats a little.

Having a higher health pool at the expense of mitigation/avoidance makes you something me and my fellow healers used to call a &quot;mana sponge&quot;. Mana sponges make a healer's life hell, and will often cause wipes because we dump so much mana healing you that we go OOM quicker than if you had balanced your stats a little.

<br />
Sorry for the OT and no offense to you, but you and yours fellows need more theorycrafting, stamina / mitigation / avoidance are basically the same things with different ratio, cause of DR you don't want to stack exclusively any of those, but if you mitigate 100 hits for 30 dmg, or avoid 10 hits for 300 dmg, or have 3000 hp more, it is basically the same things, you need to mix things in a correct way, but in theory there is no difference between stacking up hp by losing a given amount of avoidance/mitigation. Also a too high amount of avoidance always caused spiked dmg that is harder to heal with lower hp pools. Stamina has always been better for tanks till now, i don't know what will happen with cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Your point would only be valid if you would consider an infinite battle, with infinite hits, but with a tank with a fixed ammount of hp. There is no such a battle.<br />
<br />
<br />
Going back to the topic, that mount won't be for free it seems, but not that 8*750 + other mats, that's the price for a good power lvl a friend mount.</div></div><hr />

Cause once you reach level 20 in your guild, as posted 2 pages ago, you get the Happy Hour Perk, which adds 50% more to the cauldrons, making them 10 and 25 exactly. Problem solved.<br />
<br />
And to the person who asked why there is no &quot;passive&quot; bonus to Alchemy, it's called &quot;Mixology&quot;, giving you bonus effect from Flasks (excluding the Flask of Enhancement, but that is the non-raiding, out farming/questing flask you use every hour), doubling the duration (from 1hr to 2hrs) and increasing the effect by anywhere from about 25-50%, depending on the flask (it's varied hugely from flask to flask, but it typically winds up being equal to what the other professions give). Note: Mixology only works if you have said Flask/Elixir in your crafting list. If you cannot make it yourself you do NOT get the bonus duration/effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is there anything planned to fix the fact that elixirs are completely useless for alchemists? For the most part (i know there are a couple exceptions) all the other professions get a bonus of X from their profession. The Flask of Enhancement is supposed to be alchemist's solution to this. It will give the same bonus of X. So it looks like all is even. However all the other professions can them pop an elixir for 225 mastery/agility/etc. The alchemist cannot since his flask of enhancement prevents it. And the tooltip even states that the flask of enhancement is not affected by mixology.</div></div><hr />

Only one alchemy stone? That only benefits tanks? I hope they add one for each of the primary stats (but still uses mastery as a secondary stat). Otherwise the mana gain from using the stone will be more than offset by not having useful stats on the trinket.<br />
<br />
I also hope they continue to upgrade the stones each tier for once. So that we use them... and continue to use them.<br />
<br />
Also has anyone seen any alchemy only potions/flasks? What about the endless mana/health pot? What about the mad alchemists pot?<br />

I see no resilience flask or potion for alchemists - again you get far more variety as a Jewelcrafter than you do as an alchemist or scribe. With no resilience flask, you get no benefit to that pvp side if you wanted or needed more resilience. same with blacksmithing/tailroing/inscription/leatherworking - the item enhancements are pretty limited. They should allow you a way of combining different stats.. or infact... reforge your enchantment. That would work.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tilgare</div><div class="date">2010-11-09, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Currently, Happy Hour on Wowhead (http://www.wowhead.com/spell=83963) is listed as 100% while MMOCdb (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/83963/happy-hour/) is listing it at 50%. 50% does make more sense to me, but 100% would be nice, allowing you to grab a flask, use it, and grab one for later. The problem I've always had with charge based items like the Cauldron is that there is always the occasion (probably more of a PuG issue) where someone thinks it'll just be hysterical to clean out all the charges (mage table, fish feast, etc). <br />
<br />
The Sandstone Drake confuses me. It's like a mixture of the Mechano-Hog (expensive vendor bought parts, BoE) and the Flying Machine (moderately expensive gatherable parts and a 100g hula doll). The material costs seemed alright for a while, but I only recently discovered that they'd implemented the vendor bought parts. I really think that either one of two things will happen - Vial of the Sands will become BoE, thus making it a gold sink for all players or it will require 525 alchemy to transform (and perhaps the vendor cost will drop a bit). Someone mentioned that the lack of an alchemy requirement may be due a technical limitation that would prevent players from mounting the Alchemist. If that is the case, I hope that someone is able to test out the ability to learn the mount spell and drop the profession. <br />
<br />
You should mention on the front page that it is a gold sink... some people will boldly argue on forums that ~30k is a drop in the bucket, but not everyone feels the same way. =)<br />
<br />
It is interesting that the Deepholm and the treasure finding potions are NOT BoP or Alchemist only, I really thought they would be. Wasn't there also a new Crazy Alchemist Potion? Maybe I was just mixing it up with Mysterious Potion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/80487/mysterious-potion/).</div></div><hr />

No. You create the Cauldron item. The item has one charge. You use the Cauldron to create the Cauldron object that sits on the ground. The object has 17 uses. Thus you get 17 flasks out of one Cauldron (or, as has been said, 25 with the Happy Hour glvl 20 benefit.)</div></div><hr />

I'm really hoping tanks realise this. As a healer, every time I hear a tank saying &quot;Nothings changed, still stam stacking&quot; based on the fact that their own talents don't suggest anything else I die a little inside. Yeah - nothing's changed for you, but everything's changed with your healer's mana. People are more accepting that it's useful for DPS to take survival talents to help out with healer mana (even if the only way they've accepted it is by altering the talent trees to give them little choice in the matter) but most of the mana saved that way could also be saved by DPS not standing in fire, too. OTOH, tanks can't avoid being in the line of fire - and seem totally oblivious to the fact that the one guarenteed way to save my mana is by them dodging, blocking or parrying the bosses' hits. I imagine it's going to take a few months of healers bitching as tanks have had an entire expansion of &quot;OMG I'm awesome, I can haz 50k HP&quot;. During that time the life of a healer is going to be pretty intolerable as we're going to get blamed for the situation.<br />

I don't think that Enchanting is supposed to be &quot;exciting&quot; though. With disenchanting (even despite the DFer), enchanting scrolls for the lazy/rich and the money you save from enchanting your own gear it's a little goldmine. Also it's a fabulous support profession for a second character to have since it lets you DE and sell even the most useless rubbish from another profession. It's also nice for a single-toon player in that it's self-contained - being both a gathering and crafting prof, leaving a slot open for a second profession - if you do the classic Tailoring / Enchanting option you get a mount too (though, as far as we know, not a shiny new Cataclysm one) :).</div></div><hr />

Some people have no life other than the game.

So, regardless of how much money could be made your always going to run into people who have no life. Hell, two members of one of the guilds I am in don't work, one collects disability (lard ass is her problem), lives in a section 8 home, and even has groceries delivered (all on our dime) and bemoans the fact we would not take her on the raid because her computer can only do single digit frame rates while in there as if its our fault.
