<br />
I don't know if Sylvanas is going to be killed off, but it seems highly likely that Alleria and Sylvanas are going to have some sort of showdown next expansion. And with Jaina being front and center of the Blizzcon art, it's pretty clear she's heavily involved in the next expansion as well.<br />

At least the next expansion won't be about orcs!</div></div><hr />

WoW has always had the largest demo floor or the same size as one in the past and it was confirmed a while ago in an Icy Veins interview/ year in review.<br />

actually no, last wow was small, and the OW debut year it was the largest, the size of it does imply a playable expac preview, and nope its has not been 100% confirm to be announced its 99.9% likely but not 100%</div></div><hr />

I am not convinced the WoW demo will be for the next expansion. A further story patch has been mentioned. The next expansion is likely to be far from done. Hell, the new raid isn't even out yet by the time Blizzcon is here.<br />
<br />
It's far more realistic you can get a preview of the new raid, or the 7.3.5 patch. Especially if it has some new dungeon or scenario.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. They are definitely going to announce the next expansion. But playable demo of it? That's definitely too much to expect.</div></div><hr />

You're new to how BlizzCons work, aren't you.<br />
<br />
Overwatch was released how long after it was announced - AND PLAYABLE - at it's first BlizzCon? (Also of fun note - the sheer number of map and character changes from that playable setup at BlizzCon to alpha/beta/release phases). Every other WoW expansion newly playable at a BlizzCon when it was just announced and not released for MONTHS is how much of a &quot;playable demo&quot;? <br />
<br />
Rest assured - this is an expansion announcement and setup protocol - as it always has been in the past.</div></div><hr />

No, it's not. In truth, I expect them to start Beta (or Alpha or whatever the fuck they name it) by the end of the year.</div></div><hr />

Nah Sylvanas will die in the one after this one. It fits the pattern. Garrosh was elected in Cata he survived MoP and died in WoD. Vol'Jin was elected in MoP, survived WoD and died in Legion. Sylvanas was elected in Legion. She dies in 9.0</div></div><hr />

They've never not had a demo for the newly announced expansion. Usually a starting zone of some sort plus one or two 5-man dungeons.</div></div><hr />

yeah it's not..<br />
<br />
It's a bit of pandering and a bit of &quot;look how diverse our work place is&quot; circle jerking. They released a statement about it and a video thats about it that has anything but diversity in it. Just some beyond disney level pandering. WoWhead has an article on it, people called it out for the eye rolling pandering marketing approved publicity stunt it was and SHOCKINGLY the comments were closed and deleted. So shocking.

Next expac on main stage then a live demo of the expansion maybe? I'm guessing the live demo is going to be two new races, but i could be wrong. <br />
