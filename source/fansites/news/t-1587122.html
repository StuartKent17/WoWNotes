<br />
Before you can harbor any hope of defeating the Iron Horde, you must first understand what—and whom—you’re up against. Our five-part series Lords of War introduces you to some of the major players in the campaign on Draenor—beginning with the sadistic Kargath Bladefist, leader of the Shattered Hand, and continuing today with the mighty Grommash Hellscream, chieftain of the Warsong clan.<br />
<br />
Grommash Hellscream’s legend was not born from mere brutality or conquest. His indomitable will helped him survive the impossible . . . but only after his recklessness nearly cost him everything.<br />
<br />
Once you’ve watch his story, visit our newly posted Grommash Hellscream character page (http://battle.net/wow/game/lore/characters/grommash-hellscream) to read more about his legacy and his role in the events to come.<br />
<br />
Visit www.worldofwarcraft.com in the weeks to come for more episodes of Lords of War, and arm yourself with the knowledge you need to survive the battle ahead.</div></div><hr />

In the original timeline, Garrosh was likely in his teens when his mother was killed. <br />

<br />
Garrosh was born before she died, obviously, but not on the alternative timeline. There's no Garrosh there.<br />
I'm quite sure that such details became a legend that spread far and wide amongst the orcs, talking about how awesome grommash was and all that, I don't think it'd be hard for Maraad to know them.

no its not. watch the damn show. this is maraad telling varian about his experiences fighting the orcs before draenor blew up and stories of the warlords he personally fought. <br />
<br />
if this were alternate universe stuff we would have something involving some random frostwolf shaman talking to thrall or something. <br />

Garrosh was a babe when his mother died, this is original timeline, unless this Maraad is from AU... which he's not.<br />

If you need help figuring out Garrosh's age at the time, there's threads of it and you can check out the timeline on Wowpedia.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah in Rise of the Horde and any story that took place on Draenor always showed Ogres as more wild monsters without any intellect. They were minions of the Gronn, but since more than 5 years have passed, Blizzard thinks most of its fanbase is stupid and forgets these little details and retcons it in the name of &quot;BADASS&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also Gronn are now weaklings in WoD</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes he wasn't a baby but he was still quite young at that time considering he's not that much older than Thrall atm and the events that occurred in the video would have happened a few years prior to the Orc Warchiefs uniting. <br />
<br />
<br />
Different universe.. Not hard to get.. That is why Kairoz said this universe is perfect..<br />
<br />
Irregardless of the alternate universe being perfect, I'm talking about how in this LoW video Maraad is talking about Grommash from our universe so it doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
In the original timeline, Garrosh was likely in his teens when his mother was killed. <br />
<br />
But in the WoD timeline, Kairoz and Wrathion specifically went out of his way to ensure that he chose a timeline in which Garrosh was never born.<br />
<br />
He can't have been in his teens considering he is not much older than Thrall is and Thrall was born around the time the demon blood was drunk. I'm specifically talking about how Garrosh even existed in our universe if according to Maraad his mother was killed close to the time he would have been born.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrosh was born before she died, obviously, but not on the alternative timeline. There's no Garrosh there.<br />
I'm quite sure that such details became a legend that spread far and wide amongst the orcs, talking about how awesome grommash was and all that, I don't think it'd be hard for Maraad to know them. Pride is a strong thing you know, I can totally see Grom telling the story over and over, even to his enemies.<br />
<br />
I'm really having no trouble with understanding why there's no alternate Garrosh due to him not being born. What I'm finding hard to believe is that they're trying to say Garrosh exists even though his mother would have been killed around the time he would have been born and their village was decimated and razed by Orges in our timeline. Also I find it unlikely that Grom would run around yelling at the Draenei about his wife's death whilst slaughtering them or even lecturing any possible Draenei prisoners (unlikely) about it. Grom: &quot;And the moral of this story, blue skin, is not to leave your weak wife and warriors to be slaughtered by Ogres you raided.&quot; *Cleaves head*</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Short Story is about AU Grommash, this LoW is about MU Grommash and doesn't make sense as they said these events happened to AU Grom. They even specifically said that both universes have different histories so they're fucking it up by mixing them up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He doesn't kill her, that's the point. She wanted a warriors death, but he wouldn't give it to her, cause he thought she was weak. <br />
<br />
Her death, this death right here, is in our timeline and WoD's. Garrosh was born before this in ours and wasn't born at all in their timeline. Garrosh knew some details of his mothers death, the only thing surprising was &quot;His mate didn't give him a son before dying&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also Maraad is a draenei with advance unknown tech. It's not hard to say that the draenei observed many of the battles and conflicts of the time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You keep requoting a twitter response to a question about Kargath's LoW that's nearly a month old now. Considering Kargath's episode was close to the original Lore unlike Grommash's one it makes sense. However Grommash's LoW episode is a complete rehash of AU's Grommash's short story as to why he never had a child. This doesn't work for MU Grommash though if Garrosh does exist considering that Golka died around the time Garrosh would have been born in the MU which is what happened in the AU.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I really don't think Blizzard's Lore team took the Butterfly Effect into consideration when writing WoD what with all the major changes to AU Draenor's history. Even so these events can't have differed between by around a decade considering Garrosh's Birth and his Mother's death would have been only a few years before the uniting of the clans due to Garrosh's age now and it's relation to Thrall's age.</div></div><hr />

It's for both universes, the only differance is that Garrosh was born before the Ogre raid on ours, Garrosh even talks about it on the short story he knew of his mothers death. The differance here is that he was never born. You can keep dismissing the tweet for all I care, the questing asked was if these stories are for both universes, and he said correct. Period. They're exploreing the lore before Rise of the Horde is not hard to comprehend. You can dismiss it if you like, idc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand him knowing about his mother's death if he was a few years old when it happened e.g. just before the uniting of the clans occurred but the way that the Short story and LoW episode tells it is that his Mother would have died around the same time he would have been born in both Universes which cannot be true if Garrosh exists in our universe. It is a straight up Lore mess up due to taking ideas from a new universe and trying to mix it with another universes history. Admittedly they could have straight up fixed the error by saying that Grom had a son but he was killed alongside his wife when the Orges attacked or instead making these LoW episodes about Maraad's questionable interrogation of Iron Horde troops captured from around the Dark Portal over their leaders which would also make sense as to why he speaks about the Warlords in such detail and grandeur when he would have been considered an enemy in the past and would also fit his dark, vengeful manner in this expansion.</div></div><hr />

Considering Kargath's episode was close to the original Lore unlike Grommash's one it makes sense. However Grommash's LoW episode is a complete rehash of AU's Grommash's short story as to why he never had a child. This doesn't work for MU Grommash though if Garrosh does exist considering that Golka died around the time Garrosh would have been born in the MU which is what happened in the AU.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I really don't think Blizzard's Lore team took the Butterfly Effect into consideration when writing WoD what with all the major changes to AU Draenor's history. Even so these events can't have differed between by around a decade considering Garrosh's Birth and his Mother's death would have been only a few years before the uniting of the clans due to Garrosh's age now and it's relation to Thrall's age.<br />
<br />
These videos are for both MU and AU because they take place before Garrosh went back in time. The only difference is that in MU Garrosh was born and in AU he wasn't. Also in the video Golka was killed while being on a raiding party. When the Orcs go hunting or raiding in the ogre lands only the warriors go and children and weak and old Orcs stay behind. After he left Golka there to die he went back to his people to get some to hunt the ogres down but when they arrived at the raid party they decided mourn over the dead.<br />
<br />
Blizzard said on the WoD event that these videos tell the story before Rise of the Horde and it's the same story for both timelines because it pre-dates the arrival of Garrosh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The death of his mate and his incapability to see when it is time to let go is sad, but at last we see him come to understand her choice in the short story. <br />
<br />
As great as this video is. The fact that this story takes place in our universe, thus overriding one of the basic facts which were established in it by &quot;Rise of the Horde&quot; namely that Ogres were always primitive and under the sway of the Gronn worms me. While by omission it is possible their empire could have existed in the novel, it was never mentioned and is pretty much a retcon. Ok, there have been much bigger ones (Draenei), but &quot;Rise of the Horde&quot; was such a great novel that retconning parts of it feels like a sin.</div></div><hr />

I think you need to rewatch the video again. They are clearly in an Orc village that has been razed to the ground when Golka dies. As I said before it's easy to understand if Garrosh wasn't born in AU but it doesn't make sense to say the reason why he wasn't born was due to Golka dying and then have Golka die in both Universes' history at the same point in time because it just doesn't work. For Garrosh to exist in MU, Golka would have had to been alive longer than the Golka in the AU so they can't have possibly died at the same point in time e.g. Golka in MU would have had to have died after Grommash became a Warlord and Garrosh was born. It's a bit like the problem with Ner'zhul's wife being alive in the AU at the time we arrive and was not alive in the MU's time. It would be better to say both of the Universes' history is different rather than trying to make one substantial event that works in one timeline also work in the previous one.</div></div><hr />

maraad specifically states that these are HIS memories of fighting the warlords. that HE faced them on draenor and knew of their feats and stories. <br />

I fail to see how you can't get invested in a character just because you know he will become a boss. People act like a character becoming a raid boss is something objectively bad, like, as you put it, they're just &quot;another loot bag to kill off&quot;. But that is far from the case. If they are give enough development and their end is satisfying enough, fighting a character you are invested in should be awesome, not bad. If it wasn't like that then we would just have nameless bosses that are literally nothing but &quot;loot bags to kill off&quot;.</div></div><hr />

If you read the Garrosh short story, you'd see you are wrong. As much as I hate Blizzard for doing this, Draenor is completely AU. Kairoz apparently found the &quot;perfect&quot; alternate universe, one that has many different things than our Draenor. Including stuff before the fel blood.<br />

I'm quite sure that such details became a legend that spread far and wide amongst the orcs, talking about how awesome grommash was and all that, I don't think it'd be hard for Maraad to know them. Pride is a strong thing you know, I can totally see Grom telling the story over and over, even to his enemies.<br />
<br />
so wait...its not just an old draenor or a change in timeline when garrosh interfeered...its also an alternate universe?!?! same as thrall fought blackmoore when he weared orgrims armor?!?! this is redicilous...<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
no its not. watch the damn show. this is maraad telling varian about his experiences fighting the orcs before draenor blew up and stories of the warlords he personally fought. <br />
<br />
if this were alternate universe stuff we would have something involving some random frostwolf shaman talking to thrall or something. <br />
<br />
this is from before theyve even attacked the iron horde.<br />
<br />
i gues its a bad story writing...so...maraad speaks with varian about what he knows about warlords...but he tells them not the things from prior to rise of the horde...he tell him things on alternate timeline?!?!?! then this maraad must be also from alternate timeline...this maraad is from alternate or not? the one who speaks with varian</div></div><hr />

Like we killed the last boss. Keep calm, that doesn't mean he has to die, it could be quite interesting if AU Grom after being defeated and/or sacrificing himself somehow managed to live and join the normal Horde. Maybe later he will become the Warchief, who knows.</div></div><hr />

Read the short story &quot;Hellscream&quot; please.

I can't because after multiple expansions, I have just given up giving a shit about throw away characters. <br />
<br />
Grom has always been a standard for the hordes lore, he has been one of the most recognized characters in the hordes history. He has more weight to his name then even Lothar does to the alliance. Now do you think the alliance would get excited at the prospect of killing of Lothar in an alternative timeline? All they would do is complain about it not being fair.<br />
<br />
I can't get invested in a character when they are just going to wipe him from the story. I loved grom in lord of the clans, and in WC3, but this reworking of Groms past is just a way to make it seem like he's such a badass and oh look how good it makes players feel killing him off as a boner stroker. <br />
This might seem like seamless complants, but I've hated this expansion concept since it was announced, and coming right in after orgrimmar was made into a raid, its blindingly saying &quot;Not had enough killing orcs in SoO, then how about killing their ancestors to in this expansion!&quot; <br />

Oh god, please no. Bringing Grom back to our universe would already be Blizzard admitting they fucked up with Garrosh. But Grom becoming our Warchief? Holy shit. That'd be like them hanging up signs all over Orgrimmar saying &quot;lol, sorry about making Garrosh such a shitty character.. here's his dad instead!! :)&quot;<br />

i gues its a bad story writing...so...maraad speaks with varian about what he knows about warlords...but he tells them not the things from prior to rise of the horde...he tell him things on alternate timeline?!?!?! then this maraad must be also from alternate timeline...this maraad is from alternate or not? the one who speaks with varian<br />
<br />
It was originally assumed that WoD's Draenor was just going to be WoW's past Draenor with Garrosh interfering when the clans were meant to drink the blood of Manneroth but someone asked the developers about glaring differences on WoD's Draenor (such as how can Ner'zhul's wife be alive if her 'ghost' is used to convince him to join The Burning Legion and why Gul'dan seemed to be running the whole Fel show) and they admitted that WoD's Draenor was actually an AU so they can get away with the changes without retconning stuff. But going by the LoW video above it seems that doesn't stop them messing stuff up. <br />
<br />
Also the Maraad talking in the video is from our universe talking about his past memories of the Warlords although how he knows so much detail about their personal lives when he would have just been fighting to survive in the past I don't know.<br />
<br />

I have to agree with Sesto. If they made Grommash Warchief of Azeroth's Horde after WoD due to shenanigans it would not only fuck with the Horde's progression in WoW's story but it would be pissing on the perfectly epic heroic ending that Grom had back in WC3.<br />

Actually I wouldn't mind downing Lothar if it turned out he was really a mad zealot all along who relished in the slaughter of Orcs as opposed to doing it out of the protection of the Human Kingdom's and would have gladly led an assualt on the 'lesser races' of Azeroth (everything that isn't human) if his King wasn't enforcing that they were their allies.</div></div><hr />

Well, jokes on you then, many of the Warlords will die in either quest chain or a dungeon. I guess a raidzone was too #savage for the likes of Ner'Zhul.</div></div><hr />

AU Time Travel is the easiest form of time travel storytelling without having to resort to BS. So instead of running with that and making Kairoz and Garrosh's involvement (and eventually ours) the catalyst for a different story, they decide that Draenor had already been affected and this was a universe that picked out of the Wrathion's Infinite File Cabinet. Cheap Deus Ex Machina at its finest. Way to blow it, Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Now, to go even further, we have MU Maraad telling the AU version of Draenor's history. Granted, AU's version of the story needed to be told for the sake of the upcoming theme, but who made the decision that these should be stories told by our Maraad? No thought was put into these.</div></div><hr />

I'm specifically talking about how Garrosh even existed in our universe if according to Maraad his mother was killed close to the time he would have been born.<br />
<br />
Thrall was born on Azeroth, orcs drank Mannoroth's blood (in our universe) long before they even began building Dark Portal, since they drank it to wipe out Draenei, not to actually attack us. A long time after killing the last draenei (that they could find), they were pretty much DTing from bloodlust, before going on to build DP and going to Azeroth. This is one of the main differences between WoD and the book, in WoD (especially noticeably in the trailer), KJ/Mannoroth/Gul'Dan (seemingly) intended them to attack Azeroth from the get go, while in the book KJ just used them as pawns to kill off Velen...</div></div><hr />

The Iron horde should of all stormed out of that portal also. Blizzard oh why..

I went off and read the short story link and this is the explanation they give -<br />
<br />
&quot;Kairozdormu had advised him to expect a few strange discoveries. I've spent my life studying the timeways. If you try to count and compare blades of grass, you'll drive yourself mad, he had said. My plans require a few… favorable conditions, and we'll find them here. This is the perfect timeway for us. Not a perfect mirror image, but perfect nonetheless&quot;<br />
<br />
Although none of that explains anything about how main universe Maraad knows the alternate universe history. Typical blizzard mucking up lore, where's a red shirt when you need one.</div></div><hr />

Maraad is telling him what he knows of the MU Walords. He's just speculating that they are identical, which we know is incorrect from Kairoz. <br />

Essentially the alternate timeline already existed. As do countless others. All Garrosh did was bring that timeline back to our Azeroth via new Dark Portal. Which is probably the most loosely explained part. Since technically the Dark Portal should have brought him to AU Azeroth. <br />
<br />
<br />
Would you be able to recover from that level of starvation and get that bulked again? I dunno - not a nutritionist but that was brutal! Sad that he insulted his mate at the end though. Never had much respect for Grom. Awesome looking but devoid of morals imo.<br />

It's just the same thing as always - blizzard needs to come up with something (remember this entire MU is something that just randomly was chosen since it's easier than garrosh &quot;necro resurrecting&quot; the warlords and doing stuff and so on) and then they have to insert it into the lore as &quot;interesting&quot; as possible to get some hype.

Going by that logic the Lich King, Illidan, AU Ner'zhul(I believe need to recheck that fight) and Y'sharraj are still technically alive (even though they are dead or 'confirmed dead') cause we can't see their bodies. :P</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't be so bad if they DID change it up a little, like for each warlord bounce it back and forth between Maraad and Varian, and Drek'thar or Saurfang telling Thrall. If they need this kind of badly presented exposition, at least move it around. Blizzard are doing all they can to make seem like we're not meant to regard the warlords as part of the horde, despite the same characters from MU having been the hordes history, but in the same vain they don't bother to have a elder orc character recollect the warlords,</div></div><hr />

<br />
My answer is not to you directly but to that whole discussion ;)<br />
<br />
The whole story about Maraad telling it to Varian has to be seen symbolically. In a realistic world they wouldn't be alone but discussing their enemy in a team or something. Maraad is somewhat the first enemy of the Horde and Varian was the last enemy of the Horde. Varian knew the old Horde perfectly well through all the fights (together and against) but the Iron Horde is lead by Warlords he doesn't know anything about. Maraad tries to explain the paradigm shift to Varian. <br />
He wants to catch the true spirit of their true enemy. You know like they often say you only really know your enemy if you have looked him in the eye in combat or something like this ;) That's the knowledge he wants to spread. That this isn't your everyday enemy.<br />
The video isn't about the lore; it is about the player/the one who watches the video being in the role of Varian and getting to know the &quot;badassery&quot; of your enemy to come.<br />
If you want technical correctness then how about this: The Naaru (A'dal?) that are protecting the Draenei told Maraad about the differences in the timeline because they are superpowerful and think that this information is essential.</div></div><hr />

So just by the events not being 100% the same, its fact that in the warcraft universe alternate timelines/realitys exist, and they are not always identical. You can ask questions all day that wont be answered that has to do with the complexitys, paradoxs, retcons you name it that time travel and alternate realitys bring in.

<br />
We did saw the deaths and bodies of all those.<br />
<br />
But, it's a moot point after all, since in the short story Garrosh refer to Golka's encounter with the ogres. So, Garrosh probably born before the event in MU.<br />
<br />

<br />
It wouldn't be so bad if they DID change it up a little, like for each warlord bounce it back and forth between Maraad and Varian, and Drek'thar or Saurfang telling Thrall. If they need this kind of badly presented exposition, at least move it around. Blizzard are doing all they can to make seem like we're not meant to regard the warlords as part of the horde, despite the same characters from MU having been the hordes history, but in the same vain they don't bother to have a elder orc character recollect the warlords,<br />
<br />
The thing is Thrall already know the stories and he told them wrong to Garrosh, leading to everything that happened post-TBC.<br />
<br />
It's good to see the story from another source this time, one that didn't lived with the Warlords, only suffered.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The swarm of Ahn'Qiraj assaulted every zone in vanilla.<br />
<br />
The contingency (IE: left over occupation forces) of Outland assaulted the gates of major capitols with towering, giant doomlords. <br />
<br />
The Lich King assaulted every city after a campaign of subversion infecting the population with the Scourge.<br />
<br />
Deathwing cracked the world in half practically while his servants carried out terrorist attacks on both major capitols.<br />
<br />
Grommash is stopped before even leaving the Blasted Lands and his portal is destroyed in the first 20 minutes.<br />
<br />
Compared the them, he is the biggest failure of a quote/unquote Badass that Blizzard has released. This joke... is a threat? A lightning shitting black wind serpent I faced leveling my monk was more intimidating. I mean seriously, his massive army is held back by 2 dozen NPCs. What kind of bullshit is that? How does anyone ever see this farce as a badass? Nothing makes me want to kill him. He's just some weak-ass Orc who through threats and intimidation of weaker-ass Orcs formed an army. He had 35 years of intell from his son from an alternate timeline and he can't even GET HIS FAT ORC ASS OUT OF BLASTED LANDS. <br />
<br />
Explain how he is BADASS. How the Iron Horde is supposedly badass. Answer: you can't. It's pitiable weak fan service. I hope this expansion doesn't last a whole year, because I want to fight something tougher *cough*N'zoth*cough*Azshara*weeze* but alas, they need to get this orc shit out of thier system. I hope anyone at Blizzcon has the courage to call them out on this. Stand up, say NO MORE HELLSCREAM and demand some content worth fighting agains. WoD is not that at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Irregardless of the alternate universe being perfect, I'm talking about how in this LoW video Maraad is talking about Grommash from our universe so it doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He can't have been in his teens considering he is not much older than Thrall is and Thrall was born around the time the demon blood was drunk. I'm specifically talking about how Garrosh even existed in our universe if according to Maraad his mother was killed close to the time he would have been born.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm really having no trouble with understanding why there's no alternate Garrosh due to him not being born. What I'm finding hard to believe is that they're trying to say Garrosh exists even though his mother would have been killed around the time he would have been born and their village was decimated and razed by Orges in our timeline. Also I find it unlikely that Grom would run around yelling at the Draenei about his wife's death whilst slaughtering them or even lecturing any possible Draenei prisoners (unlikely) about it. Grom: &quot;And the moral of this story, blue skin, is not to leave your weak wife and warriors to be slaughtered by Ogres you raided.&quot; *Cleaves head*<br />

It's the best the Alliance has right now. We know that most big events pre blood are very similar in nature in both universes.<br />
<br />
So Maraad gives Varian the knowledge to the best of his abilities with the disclaimer of minor inaccuracies.<br />
<br />
But it doesn't matter. We're not talking about absolute technical data or explicit strategic information here. <br />
<br />
Maraad just wants the King to be able to understand the psyche of his enemy and wants to convince him that negotiation and peaceful coexistence are not an option, since Varian is still reluctant to commit to an inevitable war.</div></div><hr />

WoD's Draenor isnt some AU that just existed along side our own. If you are saying in this universe Garrosh wasnt born you are an idiot and clearly dont understand whats going on. Garrosh went BACK IN TIME.. NOT TO AN AU that has always existed. How WoDs draenor becomes an AU is when the blood isnt consumed by the orcs and the dark portal they create links to OUR current timeline. You need to think in terms of timelines and not universes. Everything that happened on WoD Draenor is IDENTICAL to what happened in the Outland draenor. Nothing is different until Garrosh prevents Gromm and the other orcs from consuming Fel Blood. Thats when things change. It doesnt change our timeline because it goes off of a theory of time travel that dictates that if you were somehow able to travel backwards in time and you managed to change ANYTHING it would instead create an alternate timeline or AU instead of changing the present and possibly creating a paradox. Its the universe's protection against such an event. Google it if you don't believe me. Its one of the theories of time travel.<br />
<br />
TL;Dr Everything that happened on Draenor is unchanged from how it happened leading up to the explosion of Draenor, making it outland. Until Garrosh prevented the consumption of felbood that is.<br />
<br />
Completely wrong. It IS an AU... we are told that explictily in the Hellscream (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/savage-world/hellscream/page-4#readmode) Story, page 4:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand how you feel.&quot; Garrosh chose his words carefully. &quot;My father died with his axe buried in his enemy's chest. A good death. But the path that led him there was paved with dishonor and was born from a single wrong decision. For too long I lived with rage toward him. It was wasted anger. Your mate's death and your clan's moment of weakness may still cause you pain, but the son she gave you—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My son? She never gave me a son.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grommash was staring into Garrosh's eyes, weighing him, judging him. Garrosh did not even allow himself to blink. &quot;I did not know that,&quot; was all he said.<br />
Kairoz. Garrosh felt a cheek muscle jump. Counting blades of grass. He took a moment to relish the memory of carving out the dragon's middle, feeling Kairoz's hot blood flow over his hands. It calmed him. Deep breaths. I was never born on this world. Grommash was never a father. Is this what the bronze dragon meant by &quot;the perfect timeway&quot;?</div></div><hr />

Even so these events can't have differed between by around a decade considering Garrosh's Birth and his Mother's death would have been only a few years before the uniting of the clans due to Garrosh's age now and it's relation to Thrall's age.<br />
<br />
By a decade, I mean from before WoD starts. The only changes are recent ones, Nerzhul's wife, Garrosh's birth were all within 10 years of the opening of the Dark Portal. Anything before that isn't really well known or discussed. So far both of these 2 videos take place within a decade of WoD. I would hope they take butterfly effects into consideration, but that is also why I don't believe the changes go back any further than 10 years.<br />

this things happened before rise of the horde...we dont know his story before that...the silly thing that they changed is that there is no little garry around...we havent seen his mate til now...why small garry isnt around i dont get it...how come the story changed before garroshes arival??????<br />
<br />
If you read the books, they set a tone that the Orcs are peaceful, that they go to Nagrand and meet up and how they set up Grom is that he's just some new chieftain who is loud and annoying. They claim the ogres are stupid and wild, there's no empire, the Orcs aren't these blood thirsty &quot;Victory or Death&quot; guys. It's hard to explain, im bad at it but if you ask people who have read the book in great detail, they will most likely agree that this is not the same as in the book.</div></div><hr />

What I'm finding hard to believe is that they're trying to say Garrosh exists even though his mother would have been killed around the time he would have been born and their village was decimated and razed by Orges in our timeline. Also I find it unlikely that Grom would run around yelling at the Draenei about his wife's death whilst slaughtering them or even lecturing any possible Draenei prisoners (unlikely) about it. Grom: &quot;And the moral of this story, blue skin, is not to leave your weak wife and warriors to be slaughtered by Ogres you raided.&quot; *Cleaves head*<br />
<br />
Alright, man. It's not that complex. Stop trying to make it.<br />
<br />
Maraad knows this story because he was there on Draenor. All the LoW stories are about our timeline. Garrosh's mother died in our timeline. Garrosh is already born, but is a child at the time of this story. So, that's how he exists in our timeline. His mother had him, and then she died in a raid.<br />
<br />
In the Alternate Draenor, he was never born. Everything that Maraad just told us happened the same way, but Garrosh was never born in this world. It's an alternate world. Things happen differently here. They didn't simply go back in time and create an Alternate universe by changing how things happen, this was always an Alternate Universe, so things will be different inherently, despite the change that Garrosh makes on purpose.<br />
<br />
This was explained when Garrosh encountered Grom in the short story recently released. He discussed this story which he knew (his mom dying), but was shocked to learn that Grom had no son.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MikeBogina</div><div class="date">2014-09-06, 03:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering Thrall is around 33 years old and Garrosh is not even 40, I don't think I'm having hard time understanding how much of a Lore mix up is going on.<br />
<br />
Considering the current year is 31(dark portal opening is year 0) and thrall was born on Azeroth. So he is younger than 31. Stormwind fell 5 years later, so he is older than 26. Garrosh and Grom betray Guldan and Mannoroth in year -4 and Garrosh was already alive at this point means he is no younger than 35 but it is mentioned that he was born a couple years before making him around 37ish. This adds up that in year 8(12years after manno drinking) that he stands as tall as Kargath(in Beyond the Dark Portal)<br />
<br />
so Thrall is anywheres between 26 and 31, but since he is stated to be born 2 years after the Dark Portal, he is 29.<br />
Garrosh is roughly around 8 years older than thrall.</div></div><hr />

That's bullshit. They didn't have to do it, it is just an EXTRA series, for which they don't take any money, they didn't have to do it at all. It's an EXTRA. How can you say they've become sly by doing something more than they were supposed to? What is more, they already said they are planning to do it in a way that MoP Shaohao series was made.<br />
<br />
Plus, the series is really nice, introducing you to every Warlord out there. And you know what? Diablo ending WAS sly. This is made in artistic way, tho. I'm really loving the way that this was made in, and I don't know if it would look better in any other way.</div></div><hr />

If he's born before the death of Grommash's mate or not, it's not important for the story and I think that's why Maraad don't mention it. In the main timeline, Garrosh is supposed to be a sick child, so he's not with his parents in the battle against the ogres but with the rest of his family. The video is accurate with both the main timeline and the alternate timeline, and small differencies are not really important because it's safe to assume that the events of Grommash rising are the same. <br />

And Maraad know the story because Grommash is an orc leader, so people know his story, the same way we know about the story of ancients japanese emperors or french kings.</div></div><hr />

..<br />
<br />
And why isn't he just called Grom anymore like in WC3?<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe he became thin enough to wringle out, but could not do it bevore because thr Ogre would have seen it and it took too long with a guard.<br />
<br />
And Grom was his nickname, I think only close friends like Thrall called him that.</div></div><hr />

It's amazing how everything is laziness nowadays.<br />

Lazy people presume laziness as the driving motivation for everybody else. Same as cheaters accusing their significant others of infidelity... everyone else must be a cheater too.<br />

Completely wrong. It IS an AU... we are told that explictily in the Hellscream (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/savage-world/hellscream/page-4#readmode) Story, page 4:<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;I understand how you feel.&quot; Garrosh chose his words carefully. &quot;My father died with his axe buried in his enemy's chest. A good death. But the path that led him there was paved with dishonor and was born from a single wrong decision. For too long I lived with rage toward him. It was wasted anger. Your mate's death and your clan's moment of weakness may still cause you pain, but the son she gave you—&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;My son? She never gave me a son.&quot;<br />
<br />
Grommash was staring into Garrosh's eyes, weighing him, judging him. Garrosh did not even allow himself to blink. &quot;I did not know that,&quot; was all he said.<br />
Kairoz. Garrosh felt a cheek muscle jump. Counting blades of grass. He took a moment to relish the memory of carving out the dragon's middle, feeling Kairoz's hot blood flow over his hands. It calmed him. Deep breaths. I was never born on this world. Grommash was never a father. Is this what the bronze dragon meant by &quot;the perfect timeway&quot;?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Or... He's partially right and the timeline splintering event is just a lot earlier than drinking/not drinking the blood</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. Garrosh specifically says in the short story that his mother died in a similar way in the MU. The only difference is Garrosh never knew the details of her death. Or that Grom found her dishonorable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus, the series is really nice, introducing you to every Warlord out there. And you know what? Diablo ending WAS sly. This is made in artistic way, tho. I'm really loving the way that this was made in, and I don't know if it would look better in any other way.<br />

Times change. <br />
<br />
That was all retconned in post WC2. Honestly, it was the peaceful, shamanic route that was a betrayal to their character. It seems to me that Orc fans loved the brutal, warrior culture of the Orcs. Not the culture that holds hands with the spirits and skips through the fields of Nagrand.</div></div><hr />

I know many have drunk the kool-aid, as the &quot;alternate universe, not hard to understand&quot; responses to lore inconsistencies are common. But it is still lame, and in my mind renders any lore completely inconsequential and pointless, as at any time the old &quot;you have been in a different universe&quot; can come up again. It's right up there with &quot;it was all a dream&quot;. If this was a sitcom, it has jumped the shark.</div></div><hr />

Because in lore, you technically did zero of those things. They were done by others groups of adventurers or by major lore characters like Tirion, Maiev, or Thrall. <br />

The Warlords wouldn't care who are heroes are. We mean shit on Draenor.</div></div><hr />

That is not true. Even Blizzard uses the selling argument such as &quot;you have defeated Illidan,now face the Lich King!&quot; and so on<br />
<br />
We are supposed to be those who defeat them,with the help sometimes of major characters. Its the center of the WoW marketing campaign, to make us feel like epic heroes (when its just an MMO but oh well...) so don't try to justify things with lies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, Thrall isn't born yet in AU as he was born on Azeroth in an internment camp, AU Draenor's Garrosh doesn't exist for some reason which let Garrosh have a longer leash when working with Grom, MU Velen didn't come to AU Draenor, and AU Khadgar is still on AU Azeroth (or not even born, I don't know).<br />
<br />
So, not an awful lot of characters that came with us have a chance of meeting with their past self. The only thing I can't seem to figure out is where AU Maraad is, unless he got killed at some point.</div></div><hr />

So far both of these 2 videos take place within a decade of WoD. I would hope they take butterfly effects into consideration, but that is also why I don't believe the changes go back any further than 10 years.<br />

If you read the books, they set a tone that the Orcs are peaceful, that they go to Nagrand and meet up and how they set up Grom is that he's just some new chieftain who is loud and annoying. They claim the ogres are stupid and wild, there's no empire, the Orcs aren't these blood thirsty &quot;Victory or Death&quot; guys. It's hard to explain, im bad at it but if you ask people who have read the book in great detail, they will most likely agree that this is not the same as in the book.<br />
