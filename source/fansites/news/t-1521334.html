An Artcraft blog went up on the french official website, Blizzard posted a couple of concepts of cosmetic-only accessories for some of the classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
These cosmetic items will probably make it into the game after the release of Warlords of Draenor. <br />
The concepts are for the moment Alliance-only but will be differentiated for each faction if Blizzard decides it's the best way to go. <br />
The could apply to every classes, for example Rogues could decide to equip cosmetic daggers or vials of poison. <br />
This is only a first concept and the dev team is still actively working on the idea. <br />

It never seemed right that the only intentionally cosmetic gear that was widely available was through the shop, meaning if you didn't want to buy, you had to do challenge modes (which not everyone can do) or be a shaman and do SoO for the Dark Shaman gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would guess some sort of extra gear slot for cosmetic items. It wouldn't do very much good it any of these took up an actual gear slot. Another possibility would be something like an enchant, but without taking up the stat based enchant slot on an item of course.</div></div><hr />

Well, that settles that. Zstr, our resident programming and design expert, confirms that cosmetic class accessories will cost a raid tier. It should be noted that while Zstr is a wizard at knowing such things, he is defenetely not the best speller.</div></div><hr />

Would be EXTREMELY frustrating that they finally give hunter's quivers back but then require players to pay to show it. If they end up just making these Alliance quiver, with a horde version for free, and add down the line different looks for these cosmetic on the shop, I think it's completely legit.</div></div><hr />

Either that or you're just too grumpy.<br />
<br />
People really get into their faction spirit, be it the mighty Alliance or the smelly Horde, and they like to show it on WoW related venues. It's that pseudo-fanaticism that help WoW get such a big player base, the same way sports teams have supportes who claim to everyone who is listening their team is the best.</div></div><hr />

Probably just a hunting dagger since it is an ammo pouch for hunters that use guns. Not much like a rogue dagger, Would be cool for rouges to have like a throwing knife kit or lockpicking kit at thier belt</div></div><hr />

NOt sure if I am right ,but if u think by this that they are copying GW2,I have to tell you that quivers were in WoW during Vanilla,TBC period (visually seen quivers ) and and other class items (like librams,totems ...) were in game in vanilla /TBC/WOTLK period but they werent visible.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nazmina</div><div class="date">2014-05-20, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They won't be exclusively store items that would just undercut potential profits. Releasing it as a new feature earn able in game and then creating a some extra store exclusive models would be better and is the way all the other cosmetic items work. Letting players earn cosmetic items in game and then offering a few extras in the store generates more interest and thus more long term sales than making the whole feature store only.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Falrinn</div><div class="date">2014-05-20, 04:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like this idea.<br />
<br />
In a few cases I think they need to at least have race-specific models, even if they are just recolors. The Alliance quiver for example wouldn't really work on a Night Elf, especially the level 100 version. Replace the gold trim with silver trim and shift the color of the wood to dark blue and it'll probably be at least be passable for a Night Elf. And perhaps if you like a different race's cosmetic item for whatever reason, you could switch over for a bit of gold after getting revered reputation.<br />
<br />
As for the idea of it being included in the cash shop. I wouldn't rule that out long term, but I believe the first round will be free.</div></div><hr />

I sense cash shop only. Blizzard is master of deception. Realm merges? No, it's called connected realms technology you faget. Zones winding with emptiness? No that's not server merge, this is cross realm zones.<br />
<br />
Griftah's authentic troll shoes were cosmetic and available in-game. CM gear is cosmetic and available in-game. Not every cosmetic item is a cash shop item.</div></div><hr />

It's even more difficult to not think about things being removed from the game to be inserted in cash shop.<br />

Sometimes i think i'm not paying enough?! Or Blizz is getting to greedy?<br />

Nah I'm talking about cosmetic &quot;upgrades&quot; to items.. which is a Wildstar feature. One of many I suspect will make it into WoW eventually. Not that it's illegal to copy ideas.. theres plenty of WoW in Wildstar. Next up will be upgrades to mounts.</div></div><hr />

Yeah! That's totally what they said here:<br />
<br />
“We envision that class accessories will be rewarded from a variety of accomplishments in World of Warcraft. These could be as simple as attaining a new level, or as monumental as conquering a vicious raid boss.

I spoke with them at the Blizz Booth at Blizzcon that year. Another idea they were debating, and I would love to see, is the return of melee/range slots for the classes that lost them for cosmetic only. Warriors could still have a bow on their back if they wanted or hunters could carry swords or such.<br />
<br />
Doubt they'll go that far, though. I do like the idea of the relic slot, though. Ammo pouches, quivers, idols, totems, and librams. What would the other classes get? :)</div></div><hr />

as long as they put a good selection of these in game as well they can put on the store whatever they want as far as I'm concerned. As for now nothing on the store is a store-exclusive kind of item.

In all fairness the blog wasn't up until after the images were found on a french site.<br />
<br />
Likely some cosmetic items will be available on the cash shop, in a similar manner to mount/pet/helm ect. Most of it will be in game and occasionally they'll add a few (Probably non class specific) models to the store every now and then.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering the post itself says otherwise - rewards for hitting levels, raid bosses, etc. I don't think it will be a cash shop.<br />
<br />
Remember, librams are already in game, as are quivers (and the quivers DO have a visual cosmetic associated with them, btw). I wore a quiver on my NE priest for a while in Cataclysm when they were showing. ;)<br />
<br />
My paladin still has a lot of his librams I just never tossed them. My hunter still has his epic quiver from Classic.</div></div><hr />

Don't buy it then if it ends up being it. Long term, yes I see them putting other cosmetic items in the Shop, but for now they clearly stated it would be rewarded in-game.<br />

Where I'm really going with this is that they need to be sure they fill all their gaps with this sort of thing. There are tons of places to stick these and various versions.

Hahaha. It would cost a raid tier for Blizzard to acknowledge other races than orcs and humans. Literaly. Thats where the entire &quot;cost a raid tier&quot; started. I am serious.<br />

I'm sure there will be different ones.<br />
<br />
Class quests could be put back in (like you did to get a weapon, not a super awesome epic questline)<br />
Leveling<br />
General quest reward options<br />
Raids<br />
PvP reward (you used to be able to buy librams, etc via pvp)<br />
Achievement rewards<br />
Random finds (considering they're using Timeless Isle somewhat, you could find cosmetic gear randomly in the world)<br />
Crafting options<br />
<br />
And yes, probably in the store at some point for certain ones. I wouldn't bother buying these, though.<br />

You both seem to be thinking that WoW or Wildstar did innovate anything.<br />
Warhammer Online invented the achivement system and the whole tracking of statistics + story and called it Tome of Knowledge. <br />
I think Warhammer Online, as bad as it was in many aspects and failed, had most of the modern MMORPG ideas. <br />
http://origin.arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.media/ars_warhammer_tok_quests_thumb.jpg<br />
They also already had cosmetic items for your gear called trophys.<br />
Here is an example:<br />
http://i.imgur.com/KK9HYvM.jpg<br />
The things in the red circle could be attached and replaced and showed what important enemys you had killed or what other things accomplished. <br />
<br />
Warhammer Online also invented Public Quests - a system the whole RIFT game is based on later and was used in Guild Wars 2 extensivly.<br />
Their crafting system was similar to he one now to be found in Wildstar.<br />
<br />
Many other stuff people praise WoW for is even older and can be traced back to Dark Age of Camelot, Ultima Online and Everquest.<br />
<br />
So no MMO today is really creative and new - it all depends on how well you execute these old ideas. Warhammer Online is the prime example that great ideas with bad execution are doomed to fail and WoW is the prime example that old ideas executed perfectly will win the hearths and minds of the masses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate to break it to you, but you won't like Wildstar much if you were upset about the changes to LFR in WoW. You know there is no easy or normal difficulty raiding in that game, right? It's all hard-mode. <br />
<br />
That said, there are plenty of things to do outside of raiding, especially if you are all about cosmetics. However, I'm sure some of the best looking stuff in that game will be gated behind difficult content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's right! After all, the cash shop has a whopping THREE helmets! And as we all know, on Planet Kneejerk, 3 is more than 88 - which is the number of pieces of cosmetic-only Challenge Mode gear that you acquire with skill in the game... but hey, lets ignore that for the sake of being able to whine and cry and QQ about the cash shop.<br />

LOL wtf does that even mean? It sounds as if your gf broke up with you and then she wanted to take you back and you weren't having any of it.

<br />
Oh, you may have to actually try! The horror! Wildstar isn't a easy game either fyi you will have to try there to. And before everyone spells doom and gloom remember that the raiding system isn't staying the same all modes besides &quot;Mythic&quot; are flex, There will be a in game queue (OQueue) function, and normal = flex Heroic = Normal. <br />
An thats even if this gets into WoD which it may not, its only in its brainstorming stage. <br />
<br />
If you just want everything handed to you well that's another issue that no game developer is going to cater to. So good luck with that idea.<br />
<br />
My thoughts: I think this is a great idea. More customization and ways to get people playing the game, having fun and raiding. Never a bad thing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kensim</div><div class="date">2014-05-20, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am assuming it will be a variety of ways, some (especially themed) may be cash shop, I suspect most will be earned via quests or achievements. <br />
<br />
So Make a Wish Foundation (company colors) quiver may be on the cash shop. A Burning Libram may be dropped off killing Ragnaros 3.0. Winning 7000 pet battles may give you a pouch with stitched in doggy bone design that will make people you carry treats for little fido in it.<br />

Warhammer Online invented the achivement system and the whole tracking of statistics + story and called it Tome of Knowledge. <br />
I think Warhammer Online, as bad as it was in many aspects and failed, had most of the modern MMORPG ideas. <br />
http://origin.arstechnica.com/journals/thumbs.media/ars_warhammer_tok_quests_thumb.jpg<br />
They also already had cosmetic items for your gear called trophys.<br />
Here is an example:<br />
http://i.imgur.com/KK9HYvM.jpg<br />
The things in the red circle could be attached and replaced and showed what important enemys you had killed or what other things accomplished. <br />
<br />
Warhammer Online also invented Public Quests - a system the whole RIFT game is based on later and was used in Guild Wars 2 extensivly.<br />
Their crafting system was similar to he one now to be found in Wildstar.<br />
<br />
Many other stuff people praise WoW for is even older and can be traced back to Dark Age of Camelot, Ultima Online and Everquest.<br />
<br />
So no MMO today is really creative and new - it all depends on how well you execute these old ideas. Warhammer Online is the prime example that great ideas with bad execution are doomed to fail and WoW is the prime example that old ideas executed perfectly will win the hearths and minds of the masses.<br />
<br />
1.Cosmetics existed in WoW even before Warhammer came out..<br />
2.Not sure if achievements were introduced in some older MMO or Warhammer was the first <br />
3.I agree that world events were introduced in Warhammer <br />
Its ridic to say that new MMos arent innovative at all considering u include in that category (category of &quot;new&quot; MMOs ) WoW also .That means that all MMOs are copying MMOs that predated WoW.... maybe new MMos are copying basic ideas that those MMOs started ,but they are also expanding those basics idea ,which implies creativity and innovation.Thats like saying that all car engine producers ,through whole past that engines car engines existed , havent innovated anything and that they arent creative at all eventho they have added so many new things to car engines .New MMOs extremly creative ,because otherwise MMo market would only be filled with HD copies of DAOC,EQ and other old MMOs.MMO genre is changing and not because old MMOs are being copied ,but because of creativity of new MMOs.</div></div><hr />

It's in the concept phase meaning none of it is done. They're not even entirely sure what items they're going to make or how we're going to attain them. They have no time frame as to when they will be available.<br />
<br />
So they're going to blog about it with some illustrations instead of blogging about how far along they are on the latest character model/zone/npc model that WILL be available in the expansion?<br />

Truly, I think the problem that Blizzard is facing now could be they are lack of methods to execute both creative and used ideas. Thay pretty much run out of ideas so what we can tell from the Timeless island is it's a copy of GW2. Since we have less content to play, I would prefer Bliizard to make efforts to make WoD a expansion that needless to be creative but full of playable content which endures playablility.</div></div><hr />

You need to check timestamps before looking silly. The blog came AFTER I posted my comment. In any case, Blizzard has changed their mind before. If they think these will make them a profit in the cash shop rather than causing people to buy subscriptions then that's where they will go. Features that entice new players = expansion feature (like new character models). Features that only appeal to existing subscribers = cash shop.<br />
<br />
If it's not in the cash shop, then it'll be a 5-6 year delay with numerous excuses about &quot;we'd like to do it, but these things take time.&quot; Since it won't come with this expansion, it'll just be plastered into a future expansion as a major &quot;feature&quot;.</div></div><hr />

And to be honest I'm getting a little tired of reading stuff like &quot;the artists just didn’t have time to do the concept justice. &quot; or &quot;and getting them into the game will likely need to wait until after you’ve faced off against the Iron Horde.&quot; I mean, what does that even mean. A year from now - two maybe? If ever?<br />
<br />
Literally with every bit of info we get nowadays, wether it's about new models, garrisons or the expansion in general, they are constantly covering for themselves by emphasizing how time intensive everything is. Sure, I know this game doesn't create itself overnight, and yes, having a good product late is better than having a bad product fast, but come on. Are we talking about the worlds biggest mmorpg with 7 million subscribers, racking up god knows how many millions of dollars revenue each month, or what? <br />
<br />
I really don't see the point in them getting people's hopes up for something that might eventually make it into the game a year down the line, but it's like, 'no guarantees guys we're still in the creative mindmapping phase.' And then it's like oh we're so thankful for your suggestions and we just wanted to share this little insight because we appreciate you so much. This post has absolutely no content apart from 'we're thinking about it' and 'we have these loose sketches to prove it' and 'don't sue us if we change our minds'.<br />

Tell me one. Not the ones everyone had. Cosmetics you buy/earn and put on your character. Just one.<br />

Its ridic to say that new MMos arent innovative at all considering u include in that category (category of &quot;new&quot; MMOs ) WoW also .That means that all MMOs are copying MMOs that predated WoW.... <br />
<br />
Yes, they do. Only few new ideas get added (like those Warhammer had). Other genres are the same. Not much happened since Unreal Tournament. They added regeneative shields and chest heighted barries in Halo and that was about it. But that's not bad. If you execute an old idea very good, the product can be awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
maybe new MMos are copying basic ideas that those MMOs started ,but they are also expanding those basics idea ,which implies creativity and innovation.Thats like saying that all car engine producers ,through whole past that engines car engines existed , havent innovated anything <br />
<br />
They executed the same idea better and better. But the three basic models of automobil motors have not changed. A motor in your new car is not a new idea. It's a high end evolution of the same idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
and that they arent creative at all <br />
<br />
Didn't say that. You have to be very creative to see an old idea so it feels fresh.<br />

eventho they have added so many new things to car engines .New MMOs extremly creative ,because otherwise MMo market would only be filled with HD copies of DAOC,EQ and other old MMOs.MMO genre is changing and not because old MMOs are being copied ,but because of creativity of new MMOs.<br />
<br />
You are the one that can't accept, that most of the stuff we do and buy are based on old ideas. New ideas are VERY VEEEERY rare. Most of the time you get variations and improvements of old ideas/concepts.</div></div><hr />

And to be honest I'm getting a little tired of reading stuff like &quot;the artists just didn’t have time to do the concept justice. &quot; or &quot;and getting them into the game will likely need to wait until after you’ve faced off against the Iron Horde.&quot; I mean, what does that even mean. A year from now - two maybe? If ever?<br />
<br />
Literally with every bit of info we get nowadays, wether it's about new models, garrisons or the expansion in general, they are constantly covering for themselves by emphasizing how time intensive everything is. Sure, I know this game doesn't create itself overnight, and yes, having a good product late is better than having a bad product fast, but come on. Are we talking about the worlds biggest mmorpg with 7 million subscribers, racking up god knows how many millions of dollars revenue each month, or what? <br />
<br />
I really don't see the point in them getting people's hopes up for something that might eventually make it into the game a year down the line, but it's like, 'no guarantees guys we're still in the creative mindmapping phase.' And then it's like oh we're so thankful for your suggestions and we just wanted to share this little insight because we appreciate you so much. This post has absolutely no content apart from 'we're thinking about it' and 'we have these loose sketches to prove it' and 'don't sue us if we change our minds'.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry for the negative post, but this is just my opinion after reading the blog post. I don't want to come off as attacking Blizzard or calling them incompetent, but I'm not a fan of their communication towards us regarding this expansion.<br />
<br />
Your last sentence is what has driven me and my husband away from this franchise, and toward Wildstar. Sure, WoW is much more polished and has years of content. However, Carbine has proven themselves 20 times over with their PR abilities. Developers of any game have their hands full, and so does the entire staff working for said companies. Mistakes will be made, and nothing is ever final until it's live. I was a part of the Name-Reserve system Carbine started last week for pre-orders. The initial day was a real fiasco, and players were highly disappointed with how it worked. Today, one of Carbine's folks posted a nice wall of text, giving details of just what happened and how it all went down. They also reset naming timers to give people a chance to adjust the names that were saved wrong. Sure, it could have gone better, but players should be used to mistakes. What we don't have to get used to is being treated like we are in-capable of understanding the truth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
can you admit that you are impossible to please?<br />
<br />
Hey, I'm not saying they shouldn't discuss what they're working on. I just think it's unfair to get people's hopes up on cool features like this if they're still in the brainstorming stage and there's a more than fair chance it might never see the light of day. Things like showing new character model progress - cool. Things like this - pointless.<br />

Honestly, you should play the game before you say all that. What if you don't like the difficulty of the game? What if you feel that they don't give content fast enough? What if 1 year down the line, carbine has the worst PR of anyone in the game business?<br />
<br />
In the end you'll probably play the game that is the most fun or best bang for the buck, PR is worthless if you're playing a shit game. That being said I wish you the best of luck in finding a game you like to play.<br />

Quiver(its semi cosmetic tho)...ah yea shirts in WoW existed since Vanilla ...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warhammer even has patented it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also patented (I don't know if they get money from Rift or if those are the same people)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, they do. Only few new ideas get added (like those Warhammer had). Other genres are the same. Not much happened since Unreal Tournament. They added regeneative shields and chest heighted barries in Halo and that was about it. But that's not bad. If you execute an old idea very good, the product can be awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They executed the same idea better and better. But the three basic models of automobil motors have not changed. A motor in your new car is not a new idea. It's a high end evolution of the same idea...the word evolution it self implies that something is evolving ...and how its changing? Certain people are creating something,thats how it changes.They have invented new mechanisms and added them to engine which makes engine preform better that didnt exist before ...thats creativity.creating something new that didnt exist before is called creativity.Even combining stuff that have already exist before is called creativity if the result of combining these stuff is something new that didnt exist before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Didn't say that. You have to be very creative to see an old idea so it feels fresh.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You are the one that can't accept, that most of the stuff we do and buy are based on old ideas. New ideas are VERY VEEEERY rare. Most of the time you get variations and improvements of old ideas/concepts.And those new variations of old ideas are old ideas expanded with new ideas.Eventho these new ideas are something essential to the old basic idea,u cant deny the fact that they are new. I have repeated few times in my previous post that all new MMOs are based on old MMOs in terms of basic ideas ,but they are much more than a those basic ideas.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From what I understand these are purely cosmetic and would go in a separate slot. The old &quot;relic&quot; slot would be brought back but just for different reasons. So for example if you're a rogue you could have a few extra cosmetic daggers in the relic slot but then you'd still have your regular daggers etc. that you'd use for combat anyway.</div></div><hr />

You might even try to do something as you upgrade models like make skeletons that all fit a certain standard/pattern so that animations would become interchangeable between races whenever you wanted.</div></div><hr />

Same. Very much the same. That would be better than a dance and I have the worst dance in the game: human female. <br />

Or Path of the Titans?<br />
Or WoD being released sometime in Spring-Summer?<br />
Or promising to release content much faster this time around?<br />
Shit, even Garrisons is turning out to be a shitty alternative to player housing.<br />
<br />
Blizz has a habit of making false promises or getting the community hyped, only to let us down in the end. So excuse the community for being a little hesitant of negative about anything cool and awesome Blizz &quot;plans&quot; on implementing.<br />
<br />
<br />
lol wat<br />
<br />
WoD was never promised for Spring-Summer. Our community made a guess and was upset, well you were, that they didn't adhere to your will. Also, do you really care that Dance Studio isn't in game? I mean, really. Housing goes against Blizzard's desire to get you out into the world and what you call shitty, quite a few of us are really excited for. Garrisons will be pretty cool.<br />
<br />
You really can't call a small vocal minority a &quot;community,&quot; who claim to hate everything wow is or is going to be when they troll WoW forums on a daily basis. I bet there are still quite a few of us excited for WoD.</div></div><hr />

What if you don't like the difficulty of the game? What if you feel that they don't give content fast enough? What if 1 year down the line, carbine has the worst PR of anyone in the game business?<br />
<br />
In the end you'll probably play the game that is the most fun or best bang for the buck, PR is worthless if you're playing a shit game. That being said I wish you the best of luck in finding a game you like to play.<br />
<br />
Did you read this thread? I'm not saying you in particular, but apparently the truth is difficult to even imagine.<br />
<br />
I played the game for months in closed beta. Now, that isn't live, but I am well aware of the game's difficulty. It suits me just fine. As far as delivering on content speed, it's gotta be faster than Blizzard. So far, they are looking at monthly bits and pieces, at the very least. If they don't live up to it, let's see why. Unless Carbine does a complete 180 with how they communicate with the player-base, it'll be worth most anything else.<br />
<br />
Again, I am very understanding of the time involved in things. It wasn't this blog specifically, but more and more of how Blizz staff has responded to questions or discussions on the forums. Sure, those aren't really the pick of the litter to discuss things with, because players are usually there to complain. However, I have seen some very meaningful discussions get locked down because the ideas are immediately nipped in the butt. <br />
<br />
Most recently: Players asked for racial-type buildings on their Garrisons. They want uniqueness. The best response was summed up with something along the lines of sacrificing a raid tier for that. That didn't bode well, and now it has become a staple thought in many players' minds. &quot;If we want something that requires a lot of art, we will lose content.&quot; Maybe, if Blizzard had given more details other than the fact that they don't have manpower, people wouldn't assume the worst in this case.<br />
<br />
Edit: I wanted to add something here. It's obvious players love customization. We want to be unique and meaningful. This is a great step for Blizzard, but if people could choose between this and racial model housing in their Garrisons, is this what they would have picked? I am generally curious.</div></div><hr />

No players are not entitled to take something they said out of context and then passively aggressively use it everytime they get a chance to talk to Blizzard. It's just immature behavior. There's a lot of types of buildings Blizzard has to draw. With the time table we are given on WoD's release, I think it's enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Plus, in it's original context what Blizzard said was probably true. Giving all races unique building sets for garrisons would of demanded the creation of roughly 900+ unique buildings. Considering that even raid tiers with a lot of new architecture have a fraction of that (I doubt 5.2 brought the equivalent of much more then a hundred, two hundred tops), then in terms of man-hours it probably wasn't that far off.<br />
<br />
Now of course &quot;costing a raid tier&quot; isn't necessarily a bad thing. No matter what there's only going to be one raid tier on release and one raid tier per patch, so any extra time can and should be dedicated to other projects.  In this case, cosmetic class accessories.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with blizzard is timming, as is with everything they do. They take ages and a ridiculously amount of time to implement anything they want to put into the game. <br />
<br />
The thing that i will not forget blizzard was the statement that they would make &quot;downtime&quot; between expansions and new content much shorter, wich we all seen now it's a complete fail with Siege of orgrimmar long life and WOD still so far away. That was their #1 promise in my mind and for me the worst problem in wow wich is the (lack of) speed in new significant content, wich would be &quot;ok&quot; if the game would not have a subs business model, but we do pay money every month, most of the time for ... nothing new.<br />
<br />
Ofc they offer all kind of excuses like &quot;we need the right special people to work in blizzard&quot; or &quot;we could get more people but i'ts not easy to find artists that share our mindset&quot; and all that kind of *ulshit, and i did believed that in the first couple of times they said in the past but quite honestly it's been an old excuse for far too long.<br />
<br />
I cannot &quot;forgive&quot; blizzard and keep being a fanboy like i always been when it's realy obvious that blizzard could do much better. Blizzard gives players a few scraps, put their signature on top of it and players go &quot;wow! amazing! &quot;. <br />
<br />
Think about it for a second here. A company with the funding power of blizzard and suposedly with some of the best artists in the world is making an anouncement about some cosmetic items, that were delayed for years for lack of time. Realy? as nice as they are, they are simple cosmetic items that should have been released years ago as part of a simple &quot;new small thing&quot; for the game. It's a basic simple thing, it should have been done long ago.<br />
<br />
I know it seems i'm QQing and being ungrateful, but please do think a little outside bias and fanboysm for a second. It's cool content, it's something players want, but blizzard should be spewing small things like this like it's a furnace from mount doom, they should have the structure, the tools, the manpower to deliver this kind of stuff on a regular basis, on a much grander scale.<br />
<br />
And this is my problem with wow and blizzard. Even tough the game has evolved during the years but damn are they slow about it. Wich is a shame, wow could be a much more dynamic and diverse game, they do have the quality on most things, but in a 10 year old game, they need to upgrade their speed, especialy for a subs business model.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not, back when we had quivers, stuff didn't get stupid big at least. Hopefully this<br />
will remain the case. But, even if quivers and such do get stupid-big, as these things <br />
are all cosmetic, we can pick and chose, not really worrisome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't like all the store items, some of them I think are inferior to versions obtained by other means.<br />
If you do then that is an opinion on aesthetics, one you are welcome to have but that does not make your argument right.<br />
They are not simply better.<br />
<br />
As an example I find the horns helm to be very underwhelming, and really uninspired since it has been done before.<br />
Adding fire does not imo make it special.<br />
Really lacking options for complimentary transmog makes those helms rather unattractive to me.</div></div><hr />

The fact these new items are cosmetic, signifies that some of them will be sold on the Blizz store in the long term. That almost ensures that it will be implemented.<br />

What about Warriors? I never liked playing Prot so I always missed out on the &quot;shield on your back transmog&quot; stuff, but I'm anticipating something generic like trophies. Just so long as it's not ALL the same type of decor... I didn't much care for the MoP Warrior armor because it was just, hey, dead thing on my shoulder, or big tusks... yet again. And since it'll be WoD, I'm also expecting a heavily orcish theme (sigh). Some variation would be nice, 's all I'm sayin'.<br />
<br />
My guess for warriors is banners, enemy heads, stuff like that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lillyth</div><div class="date">2014-05-21, 01:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what about racial accessoires? You knew the question would come.<br />
<br />
Kaldorei Glaives as weapons is something people want anyway. And I wouldnt mind having Kaldorei-esque armour or maybe a quiver in a purple night elven theme, that'd be awesome.</div></div><hr />

Filler blog is filler blog. Literally no info worth of anything here.<br />

Sadly i must agree with you, i'm a bit disapointed also that there haven't been any &quot;new Race&quot; model's ;/ it's been garrisons and this. so i'm taking the artcraft with a grain of salt.. tbh.</div></div><hr />

There might not be specific set of accessories for everything single race/class combo, but I could see a few variations happen to fall into racial themes. The Night Elves in particular would at least need their own quiver, which could probably work for Worgen as well.</div></div><hr />

When have we ever gotten blog about Dance Studio or even Path of the Titans? If anything this libram stuff is more hopeful then it's predecessors.</div></div><hr />

Apparently they are called Sashimonos, and that is a great idea. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sashimono<br />
<br />
I am also interested to see how they differentiate blood knights and sun walkers from paladins.</div></div><hr />
