European 2v2 Arena Team reaches 3000 Rating<br />
These guys probably won't have any problem with the season 4 rating requirements changes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=6650.0). The DonLolo z Wladem (http://armory.wow-europe.com/team-info.xml?r=Burning+Legion&amp;ts=2&amp;t=DonLolo+z+Wladem&amp;select=DonLolo+z+Wladem) Team on the EU-Burning Legion server (Bloodlust Battlegroup) reached 3000 Arena Team rating in the 2v2 bracket. Noksil (http://armory.wow-europe.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Burning+Legion&amp;n=Noksil), a human paladin, is the first player to reach 3000 Personal Rating. <br />

US Realms Extended Downtime<br />
Our regularly scheduled Tuesday maintenance will begin at 3:00AM PDT, April 29, and end at approximately 11:00AM PDT. During this time all realms will be down and not accessible for play. <br />
<br />
We will be performing maintenance on the forums on Tuesday April 29, from 5:00AM PDT to 8:00AM PDT. During this time players will not be able to login to the forums but will be able to read them as usual. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html;jsessionid=6BEEDB2F71A672316F13DC5E2CF1A8BB.app09_06?topicId=6214101843&amp;sid=1))<br />
<br />
Tuesday's maintenance will be an extended one for the US Realms, even if it could be the sign of a 2.4.2 Patch release I wouldn't really expect it only one week after the deployment of the patch on test servers. However, with the forums down as well, you'll have plenty of free time and you might want to read the 2.4.2 changes post, it will probably keep you busy for a few minutes.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Omar</div><div class="date">2008-04-29, 10:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Holding a 3000 rating would require them to win 99 out of 100 games against 2200 rated players. That is, if all teams on similar ratings in the pool actually play against each other, every team is always trying equally hard to win, and enough games have been played to reach a somewhat stable state. Unfortunately, we all know that these requirements aren't met in the Arena and that ratings mean less than we'd like them to mean.</div></div><hr />

I don't want to be the one throwing accusations of cheating first.<br />

Why not? It's pretty obvious via their class make-up, enchants and gear that they are indeed cheating. I don't think the best legit arena players could ever reach 3000, because one will always lose.</div></div><hr />

I know that because we play on the same server. They get well known about 3 months ago when they reached world first place on sk gaming site. Since then there was many topics on Burning Legion forum about them, all closed by Blizz moderators<br />
Also many people report them, but as we can see, they still play.<br />
After some time they reached &gt; 2800. Then the topic came &quot;Gz, 3000 soon?&quot;<br />
Month later they reached 2900... and today we know about 3000.<br />
<br />
Now anyone can congratulate how stupid this team is.<br />
The strategy for this play is easy and probably well known. This guys have second team, probably with alts inside, and they only play when most of the server population sleeps. Since noone is playing, they play only with the alt one.<br />
The alt one is loosing to them.<br />
<br />
Hope they will soon get the attention from blizzard because this is 100% stupidity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the alt team losing to them once costs 20 team rating right ? <br />
losing 50 games in a row will put the alt team 1k lower rating <br />
<br />
those 2 teams should not meet , no matter what hour <br />

Perhaps they OMGbuy another team around 2.1k and boost their alts' one up again<br />
<br />
And no, they don't gain 20 rating per win obviously, that would mean the alts' team being higher than theirs -.-</div></div><hr />

Process: Be a nerd and stay online till about a time where barely anyone plays, log to vent with the 4 of you cheating. Queue at the same time, yell when the queue pops up, if it happened at the same time you can enter and you are guaranteed to have matched each other. If not simply drop the queue and try again.

<br />
After they cheat their way in the to best PvP gear in the game, they then go out in to the PvE environment and battlegrounds with a major advantage over those who do not cheat. PvE content is the reason this game is here, not arena.</div></div><hr />

no, if the arena is empty, you even can't spank 'em for having cheated :'(<br />

correct the penalty bug for leaving queue, but before the S4 release... can you imagine ? what would happen to them...<br />
<br />
3K rating team leaving a queue, loosing against à 2k rating team, say bye to 45 points or so :D<br />

and go on, loosing all your games, or disband that F team...<br />

its not fixed. Win traders rarely have to drop queue at 4am. They are already bragging about it. Higher rating reqs = more profit<br />
<br />
the only way to truly fix this is enforcement of the rules - pay some GM on every realm to work the graveyard shift every night and be a ruthless watch dog, handing out bans to people he finds win trading. <br />
<br />
Better yet strip them of their arena gear, punt them back to 1500, and put a special deserter buff on them for a week so they cant queue. That way everyone will see they are cheaters.<br />
<br />
They should start by making an example of these 2 clowns. Thats one of the worst shadowstep builds I have ever seen btw.</div></div><hr />

The guys at 3000 rating is INFACT &quot;Win-Traders&quot; And we're 100% sure because i'm from the same battlegroup even. I've never met em, nor the 2.4k + guys. And for like 5-6 weeks ago, they had full greens. I'll tell you how they do it, since they're fixing it next patch anyway...<br />
<br />
This is how the morons cheat: join up with 2 accounts, at 2 computers, at the same time.. If the queues pop at the same time, they join. If not, they leave queue.<br />
<br />
this is very easy since blizzard made the imba change &quot;you will not lose arena ratings from leaving the queue, no matter what time. Just not inside&quot; This is ridiculous easy.. But ban-able, these guys know they'd get banned. So they're just finishing off i guess.<br />
<br />
the facts that noobs could get to 3000 rating is a bit weird, but the facts that i guess a few skilled, geared and insane players at lets say 2300 rating. If they do it like once in a while they'd get 2400.. Just this is really annoying. Can't wait untill the patch 2.4.2</div></div><hr />

Either that entire realm sucks hardcore in arenas or they cheated. There is no way in hell this team make up is better then a druid/warrior make up.<br />

This again proofs how - &quot;competitive&quot; the arena system is....<br />

From day one everything about arena has been exploided. And still Blizzard keeps giving away stuff - In BGs for afking and Arenas for obvious long term foul play. All for the good of E-SPORTING in a MMO game !<br />
<br />
And you know what ? The devs will never admit they screwed up.<br />

Im just waiting to see how blizzard is going to react to this.<br />
<br />
They know with that kind of gear, no team on earth can make a 3000 rating.<br />
<br />
So if they let it fly, it proves that blizzard really doesnt give a flyin F how this game turns out. If they ban them then good on blizzard.</div></div><hr />

keep working blizz you havent fixed anything yet. In fact, you probably made things worse by raising the PR req (more demand for boosting services). <br />

Its a good start but 2k rated win traders rarely have to drop queue at 4am. keep trying.<br />

I find people have a hard time arguing a pvp rpg whos classes are so balanced, no one class dominates over another. Limiting factors are in the number of spells you can take with you, but secondary classes and the number of different spells available allow any one class to combat another. Oh, and they still tweak every now and then (although after 3 years... its pretty much perfected, so not to many tweaks now).<br />
<br />
PvE wise it peters out once you play through it all (Theres no uber weapons and armors to raid for, so character progression slows to a halt at lvl 20). But pvp wise, you don't know how thrilling it is to be a healer and have a chance in a game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
GW sounds too good to be true the way you describe it. <br />
<br />
So I googled &quot;guild wars pvp balance&quot; and… well see for yourself<br />
<br />
http://www.guildwars.com/competitive/articles/interviews/20071112-skillbalance.php<br />
<br />
Some gems from it<br />
<br />
&quot;The top level of PvP is stagnant&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Looking at the current metagame, many players didn't like what they were seeing in terms of balance, and many questioned if ArenaNet wanted or knew how to handle the situation. &quot;<br />
<br />
Sound familiar?<br />
<br />
&quot;Currently, things are indeed balanced in the sense that everyone runs the same basic three or four builds with slight midline variations: two Warriors, two Monks, Ranger, Mesmer, Blinding Surge Elementalist, and a flag runner. Many matches thus end up being boring mirror matches, where the teams are pretty even, but not very interesting.&quot;<br />
<br />
My god if I made this up I couldn’t have phrased it more similar to the complaints about WoW.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rensyk</div><div class="date">2008-04-29, 09:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">3K Rating is just..to much &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sousui</div><div class="date">2008-04-29, 10:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Rav, there is the issue of matches going on for to long. This is generally because one class dosnt pwn another..so death does not come easy (and as Izzy said, its bad when nobody dies). And currently alot of guild matchups have taken a defensive stance, waiting for the timer to run out so no more auto resurrections can take place. However just like WoW has its &quot;best of the&quot; 2v2 and 3v3 builds... not everyone plays them. Guilds run several types of matchups..with people who play how they like and such. Also theres smaller and hero (one player.. 3 npc.. yea I know..some like em thing this is kinda stupid..but hey..some people like it) matches too.<br />
Also theres more then just capture the flag. <br />
<br />
as much as the balance sounds to good to be true though.. it is. Maybe to good? maybe... they should really look into some new game types. But in the end, one class can matchup to another class easily with a specific secondary class and set of spells. <br />
<br />
IMO this is far better then the &quot;Oh gee im sorry.. youve entered this arena with the wrong class and build, game over man. Heres your consolation prize of free epics!&quot; that warcraft gives you. ^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this news is pretty much the only way to expose wintraders, because blizzard does not react on any forum posts. however wintrading IS NOT fixed with 2.4.2 due to the fact that u still can play at pretty impossible times for ppl with a job / other commitments like school / university or something where u dont even have to dodge queues cause no ones playing.<br />
Furthermore i know that Wintrading is a big issue on every single rp, i play on Blutdurst-Eu on 2100+ rating with my rogue(with fmage) for example, there are 4 possibilities :<br />
1. We meet teams that are much lower than our team (40%)<br />
2. We meet teams on an equal rating or slightly higher (30%)<br />
3. We meet teams that are way higher rated, e.g. +21 etc. (10%)<br />
4. We meet no team and get ---, most likely known as wintraders (astonishing 20%)<br />
<br />
This arena system is fucked up I HIGHLY DOUBT that any team is capable of a 90%+ winrate in the 2,4k-2,5k bracket, except possible 5on5 cause it's not depending on matchup so hard</div></div><hr />
