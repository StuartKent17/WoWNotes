Legendary Dagger Preview - Fangs of the Father<br />
Blizzard released a preview of the legendary daggers, with finally extra info on the wings. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
These powers include a stacking increase to Agility which builds until dark wings unfurl from the rogue’s back, removing the combo point cost and increasing damage of finishing moves for a short time.<br />
In addition, the wings which can be spread on command (with no combat benefit) to slow a rapid descent, allowing the rogue to slowly fall to the ground<br />
<br />
<br />
“They wanted to hold me, to keep watch over me – a prisoner in all but name. But I will NOT be held accountable for the sins of my father. My destiny will be my own.”- Wrathion, the Black Prince<br />
<br />
The Contract<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3 will offer the most deadly and experienced rogues the opportunity to finally play a central role in the fate of the world the rogue’s way: by manipulating key events from the shadows. Players will travel across continents to accomplish crucial missions of reconnaissance, burglary, infiltration and, of course, assassination. Those familiar with the events that unfolded in the Badlands since the Cataclysm struck may recall the story of Rheastrasza, the ambitious red dragon who acquired a black dragon egg and magically purified it, cleansing it of the Black Dragonflight’s corruption. While those events may lead to a more hopeful destiny for Azeroth, it will take cleverness, stealth, skill, and the help of a few friends to unravel the web of intrigue that will reveal what became of the egg… and determine the fate of Deathwing himself.<br />

<br />
Wetwork<br />
<br />
Rogues willing to do whatever is necessary to ignite a brighter future must first delve into the Dragon’s Soul raid dungeon to begin the quest line. Those who prove their prowess within will be set on a collision course with Ravenholdt Manor and the enigmatic Black Prince, Wrathion. This shadowy figure could be the key to victory for the mortal races, but what is his true agenda? Before the truth behind these mysteries are revealed, enterprising assassins will need to fight tense raid battles against Deathwing’s most powerful minions, and embark alone on perilous missions to seal the fate of the Black Dragonflight. The quest culminates in the earth-scorching execution of Deathwing himself and a shocking revelation about the true nature of the mission.<br />

<br />
What’s in it for me?<br />
<br />
Rogues who succeed will receive a paired set of daggers that will become increasingly lethal as their bearer progresses along the legendary quest. At the height of their strength, they will be imbued with the vile essence of the Old Gods, as well as the maddened fury of the Black Dragonflight -- bestowing great power upon their bearer. These powers include a stacking increase to Agility which builds until dark wings unfurl from the rogue’s back, removing the combo point cost and increasing damage of finishing moves for a short time. In addition, the wings which can be spread on command (with no combat benefit) to slow a rapid descent, allowing the rogue to slowly fall to the ground… or enact a little death from above! When it comes to dealing death, the Fangs of the Father promise legendary killing power to rogues of any specialization.<br />
<br />
An incredible adventure and legendary rewards await. The future of all life on Azeroth hangs in the balance. Better get moving.<br />

Priest Tier 13 and Visual Retrospective<br />
Blizzard released their preview of the Priest Tier 13 and confirmed the site datamined a few hours ago. <br />
Adventurers will be tested like never before in 4.3 as they take on Deathwing and his minions, emerging with powerful new treasures. Please enjoy this preview of the priest tier 13 set, as well as a visual guide to tiers 1 through 12 for Transmogrification purposes.<br />

<br />
Vestments of Dying Light<br />
<br />
Priests (and paladins for that matter) are often the most challenging classes to design ‘badass’ armor sets for, in contrast to the death knight and warlock, whose underlying concepts demand the unquestionably cool dark and sinister approach.<br />
<br />
In this instance, however, the design asked for a bold, two-tone, ‘Venetian carnival style with creepy, soulless black eyes,’ which gave me a powerful, potentially edgy direction to explore. The set’s ‘Dying Light’ theme was visualized as a spiked, setting sun motif.<br />

Dang...Screw you guys :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
The Priest tier looks sick. It's like combining the cliche drama masks used as the play/drama symbol. The helmet, that is. I personally really like that style, it's mysterious and pretty bad-ass, especially seeing as how every tier design is given a theme, and the artist has to do something with it. Mad propses.<br />
<br />
The daggers might sparkle or shine or something, you guys just see still images. People need to broaden their horizons...or...views of still images... :cool: (blindly).</div></div><hr />

It's a redundant and useless ability. If they're going to make an ability that is only 'useful' aesthetically, they should make it a mount. That, and the daggers look horrible, in my opinion. The only screenshot where they look good is the glimpses one, but that's because they're hidden and enhanced by the cover of darkness.</div></div><hr />

Go level engineering. It's cheaper and less time consuming. Not to mention Batman doesn't wield daggers. Thrown, but not daggers. He uses his fists, gadgets, or in the case of Batman Begins, a sword.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I have Engineering with a nice parachute cloak (and I suspect quite a few rogues have it as well), the wing proc doesn't do much for me, and rogues do already take less fall damage anyways from talent. I do like the visual proc aspects, even if they might look a bit odd if you're not using that rather lame batman t13.<br />
<br />
As for the dagger design themselves...honestly was expecting them to move away a bit from the tentacles and such, but guess not. Still, it's not bad looking by any means, but I find myself liking the stage 2 better than final stage one. Anyone know if these will sheath to the side or back?

It's a redundant and useless ability. If they're going to make an ability that is only 'useful' aesthetically, they should make it a mount. That, and the daggers look horrible, in my opinion. The only screenshot where they look good is the glimpses one, but that's because they're hidden and enhanced by the cover of darkness. QQ moar? I get so sick of all the &quot;it is useless if it does not give me 1000 more dps or a killer move in arena&quot;. Yes, maybe it is useless, just like the mount-part of the legendary staff was, but why do everyone these days have to be so utilitarian that they cannot enjoy some fun and coolness. It is a friggin GAME FFS, so chillax and learn to enjoy yourself without having to cram every feature into a theorycrafting chart.<br />

Rogue daggers are badass but theres no way in hell I could achieve them with my current job, sucks.

WoW makes me want to start my own gaming company and I would just read gaming forums all day and make the games people want. You want some daggers with a jetpack, Ill fucking make you that. Seriously. I wish WoW was like a fast paced Japanese video game when you raided, I'm tired of standing around spamming buttons then a fire wave comes but I don't have to move, then I have to kill a little add, then back to avoid/spam.

That is an excellent summary of 99% of the whining I'm seeing from Rogues. <br />
<br />
I'm still trying to figure out the whining/gloating that the Warlocks seem torn on. I'm just going to mark it all up to &quot;none of them even know how the daggers will affect them at all, so they're stupid for making an assumption on their 'OPness/laughableness' either way.&quot;<br />

WoW is getting worse. Legendary item for only one class. What a disgrace for the company who repeatedly said they wouldn't create any class specific content. So here we are. Legendaries for the most favored class ever. /pukepuke<br />
<br />
How badly will your mind be broken if we point out the Hunter-only legendary from Burning Crusade and the slew of hunter-only rare tames that came with 4.2?<br />
<br />
Even better, how about the class-specific content that was all over the place since Vanilla? The quests to get Benediction? The Paladin and Warlock mount quests? The epic shaman batman helm?<br />
<br />
No class is favored above any others, it only seems that way when you're seeing somebody getting something you aren't having given to you on a silver platter. Read up and grow up. I'm sure that whatever class you play as your main had something dedicated soley for it over the history of the game. <br />
<br />
I'm really sick of seeing brats like you scream that there is a &quot;class favored above others&quot; with each content patch. Last one was Druids -- &quot;IT'S ALL ABOUT DRUIDS BAWWWW,&quot; said hundreds of kids whining that we were fighting alongside druid NPCs. Before that, Prot Paladin tanks, &quot;THEY'RE EZMODE TANKING&quot;. Before that, Mages &quot;Spell reagent: tears of warlocks&quot;. Death Knights. Ret Paladins. Shaman. Priests. Even if they put out a content patch with a spec specific treat for everyone, though, people like you are going to scream that you got the short end of the stick vs. some other class/spec because you see something you wish you got instead of what you DID get. You could even get a content patch that gives something to what you love playing the most class/spec wise... and you'll still absolutely hate it. Because you're the small child strapped into a shopping cart seat at Wal-Mart, pointing at a shelf of toys screaming and crying and wetting yourself. There is the unreachable shelf of things you want, because you KNOW there's toys there just out of your reach. You really don't care what they do, you just want them because they're there and you don't have them. And if your poor parent decides to grab the toy off the shelf, you're still going to bawl and retch and scream until the store manager throws you out because that's not what you want.<br />
<br />
You want attention. You want to feel special. And none of us are in the business of giving you that, beyond being told off for being stupid on internet forums.</div></div><hr />

Except for the fact it wasn't hunter only and was only relevant for an incredibly short amount of time compared to other legendary with the exception of the staff from the original naxx whose name escapes me atm. Not to mention after the change to steady shot that came with 3.0 reduced it to little more then a bag slot and a novelty leveling item for WotLK.

And all of this only 1% of the player base BS is just that, BS. Just like firelands, Demon Soul is going to get nerfed and every rogue with a half arsed guild and their grandmothers will run around with these daggers.

Not that I agree with the other poster. Cause I don't.<br />

But Thori'dal, the Stars' Fury didn't have a Hunter only restriction it. It was able to be used by Rogues and Warriors. Though it probably benefited Hunter's the most. It wasn't Hunter class specific.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of us recognise that the proc is only for the final version of the daggers, and goodness knows what we'll have to go through to get it, and we're also experienced with Blizzard's policy on giving nice things to rogues.<br />
<br />
That proc will be in the game for approximately the length of time it takes for someone to get the daggers and proceed to roflstomp someone in PVP. Then we'll find out what the daggers will do for the REST of us.<br />
<br />
Oddly enough I'm partly amused because 500% threat may not hold a candle to the proc on these, if crits are still 200% threat. 3-4 free envenoms/eviserates with the crit chance and pure damage from a massive stacking agi buff...rogues with the &quot;derp daggers&quot; are still going to be pariahs within their own guilds.<br />
<br />
Also, why so creepy crawly? I guess since I won't see these until some time in the next expansion, it's not like I'll ever use them other than to piss people off in org by flapping my wings in their face. XD</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thought the same thing. Couldn't help but imagine priests rocking this and yelling &quot;Cast in the name of God, ye not guilty!&quot;</div></div><hr />

There's the hounds and some weapons from Firelands, and now these legendary daggers. It looks really weird.It's not cell shading, it's just a neat texture trick. Basicly you make a texture around the dagger that is transparent from the outside and bright red on the inside so when you view it from one side the oposite side, being bigger, sticks out abit letting you see the mostly-hidden bright texture</div></div><hr />

Are you shitting me?Why does solo have to = easy? There's hundreds of ways a solo legendary quest line could be done, and done properly. however, at this stage of the game, there is almost 0 creativity coming out of Blizzard's think tanks. So they just add in the 'raid boss' requirement and be done with it.<br />
<br />
Shame really, could have been done so much better. We're really starting to see the limits of the original coding of the game come out.</div></div><hr />

I wish all tiers had the same kind of attention and detail of the Paladin S11 PvP set, now that is how a PvE set should be and no I dont play a paladin my main is a shaman and Im envious of how freaking awesome the Paladin PvP set looks, should've been their PvE set.Oh and I still think priest T6 is the best looking Tier they got.</div></div><hr />
