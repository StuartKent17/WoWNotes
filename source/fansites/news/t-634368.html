Talent Dual Spec Q&amp;A with Ghostcrawler<br />
With the next content patch, we will be introducing a number of additions and changes to the game. One new feature in the works is the ability to set up two separate sets of talents, or &quot;dual spec&quot;. While the complete feature may not be immediately available in the Public Test Realms (PTR) and specifics are still liable to change, we wanted to go over some questions with Senior Game Designer Greg &quot;Ghostcrawler&quot; Street to find out more.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: What is dual speccing?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Dual speccing is the ability to save two separate talent specs, glyphs, and action bars. <br />
<br />
Nethaera: Why are we allowing players to dual spec after all this time?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We really felt like this was a great way to increase the flexibility available to players and encourage them to take part in more aspects of the game. To use just one example, some players like to participate in both raids and Arenas, which is awesome behavior that we want to promote. But, there are some talents which are more useful in one part of the game than another. Currently, players have to pay respec costs and go through the process of setting up the desired talent spec and action bars whenever they switch.<br />
<br />
The new system makes this a much more logical process, saving on time and cost and allowing players to easily move from one aspect of the game to another.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Who will be able to use it?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Players who have reached the maximum level will be able to set up dual specs.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Why do players need to be max level in order to do this?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We didn’t want to burden lower-level players with extra complexity as they’re working to level up and learn their class. But if the feature proves popular we might consider expanding it.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: How will you be able to set up a dual spec?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Players will be able to visit their trainer and pay a one-time fee to be able to use it.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: How do you switch between specs?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Players will be able to switch between their talent specs by visiting any Lexicon of Power provided they’ve paid for the ability to have a secondary spec. Lexicons of Power will be available in major cities, and inscribers will also be able to create a new item that summons one. Anyone can purchase this item, but it requires a ritual of several players to summon it for use by the party. It’s similar to a repair bot in that it will exist in the world for a short duration. It’s important to keep in mind that you will not be able to switch specs while in combat or Arenas. While you won’t be able to switch your spec without the Lexicon, you will still be able to look at your secondary spec whenever you want to.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Will solo players have the ability to switch their specs outside of the cities or will they still need to visit a Lexicon of Power?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Solo players will still need to go into the city to visit the Lexicon of Power to switch their talent spec or will need to get together with other players to summon one in.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Is the item that allows you to summon a Lexicon of Power reusable, or is it used up?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We haven’t made a final decision on that yet, and will be evaluating how it works on the PTR.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Can I respec only one of my talent sets, or will I need to respec them both if I reset one?<br />
Ghostcrawler: When you reset your talents, it will look at the spec you currently have in use as the talent set you want to change.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Will you be able to switch gear easily to match your spec?<br />
Ghostcrawler: At the same time we implement dual specs, we will also be setting up a gear system. The feature is called “Gear Manager.” It can also be used to just swap weapons or trinkets or put on that tuxedo to strut around town. It will not automatically switch your gear when you change your talent spec, but it will allow for an easy gear change between them. The feature may not be fully functional immediately in the PTR, but we’ll have more information to share about it before too much longer.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: What about hunters? Often their pet talents are set up to match the talents of the hunter. Will they be able to switch their pet specs as well?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We will wipe the pet talents. However we are going to remove the respec cost for pet talents so that players won’t feel like they need to jump through an additional hoop to respec their pet. In addition, we are going to provide hunters a new core ability to let them remotely access their stable on a long cooldown. This way if their exotic pet heads off to the stable, they will be able to get a different pet. We hope to be able to discuss this new spell in more detail when we get a little further along.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Will you be able to change your Glyphs as well?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Glyphs will be tied to each talent spec so that if you switch between them, so too will the Glyphs. You’ll notice the UI will have changed a little bit so that the Glyph panes show up alongside the Talent panes now that they are associated.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: What about hotbars? Will players be able to save them for the talent spec they’re running?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Yes, you will be able to save hotbars and use them with your talent specs. It just saves your bars at the same time as it saves the glyphs and talents. If you want to switch to your other action bar, you will need to change specs.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Is there a way for players to choose their talents without them being saved? Currently, once you spend your talent point, it’s spent unless you pay the respec cost again.<br />
Ghostcrawler: With the dual spec feature, we are going to allow players who respec to configure all their talents before they get saved. They will be able to allocate the points, then choose if they want to use that as their spec, rather than needing to carefully diagram out their talents ahead of time. This will allow players a little more freedom when deciding on the talents they want to pick and avoid costly mistakes.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: Will players be confined to only setting up two specs?<br />
Ghostcrawler: We will be launching the feature with just two specs, but depending on how we feel it works out, we might consider additional specs in the future.<br />
<br />
Nethaera: When can players expect to try out dual specs?<br />
Ghostcrawler: Players will be able to try out the dual spec system on the Public Test Realms when they are made available. This has been a pretty big project with a lot of people working toward making it a reality in the game. We’ll definitely be watching the feedback and looking for ways of making sure the system works the way we all envisioned it to.</div></div><hr />

Very true, however said warrior would need to have tanking gear<br />

I'm equally excited to see the Gear Manager. I really like ClosetGnome, so we'll see how Blizz does it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unfortunately, I doubt it will be the case...<br />
<br />
There is no tank shortage.<br />
<br />
There is, however, a shortage of tanks (and in many cases, healers) WILLING to PUG... as well as a surplus of n00bs who require overkill stats for non-raid dungeons. It is perfectly possible to tank heroics in the blue saronite gear set without any hitches, too bad people are still in the TBC gear mindset. <br />
<br />
This change is very unlikely to make a sufficient enough players willing to tank or heal in general. This is something the WoW community itself has to change in order to remedy the problem.</div></div><hr />

There is, however, a shortage of tanks WILLING to be recruited for PUG's... as well as a surplus of idiots who require overkill stats for non-raid dungeons. It is perfectly possible to tank heroics in the blue saronite gear set without any hitches, too bad morons are still in the TBC mindset.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, no need to take the low road with name calling. No server is exactly like yours, so the general statement of &quot;there is no tank shortage&quot; isn't true. A lot depends upon the age of the realm, timezone, etc. Most people prefer their Heroics to be as quick and painless as possible, especially the healer.<br />
<br />
As long as said Saronite gear gets you to 537 D and 20K, sure.</div></div><hr />

Aye! =D<br />
Btw, be sure to buy your exstra glyphs now before it will be implented :p<br />

To save a lot of gold on the new rush of glyphs that people need..</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I currently use Outfitter and I love it. The gear will be in your bags but it has an identifier as to the set it is part of (ex. tanking, dps, etc.). By the press of 1 button you switch out your entire equipped gear with the saved items for various sets. I imagine Gear Manager will be similar.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fatalle</div><div class="date">2009-02-12, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A couple other things to consider:<br />
<br />
1. This will give hybrids alot more to do if they find themselves feeling bored. Work on equipping your other spec as it is now viable to consider both of them first position. Which brings up the potential issues of...<br />
<br />
2. Main spec. When rolling for gear drops it used to always go to main specs first before off specs. Now pali tanks will want to roll against dps plate or healing plate that drops. I hope this doesnt cause too much of an issue. Obviously for guild runs it wont be but PUGs? Another reason not to run PUGs I guess if you can help it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">AoBman05</div><div class="date">2009-02-12, 07:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wow, no need to take the low road with name calling.* No server is exactly like yours, so the general statement of &quot;there is no tank shortage&quot; isn't true.* A lot depends upon the age of the realm, timezone, etc.* Most people prefer their Heroics to be as quick and painless as possible, especially the healer.<br />
<br />
As long as said Saronite gear gets you to 537 D and 20K, sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry, I'm not trying to be mean, I'm really a nice guy who hates putting people down intentionally.<br />
<br />
But really, It's often better to guild run because they are more likely to run with people with a clue on their class and others. PUGs tend to annoy tanks and healers really easily and they often aren't patient with wipes after running with much more successive guild runs all the time. Add the fact that they often don't need any loot or any long term rewards from the instances anymore is usually why they typically don't bother. Many people seem to not want gearing-up tanks for some whacked out reason, probably to be carried thru quickly by better geared people.<br />
<br />
The big problem with some of the above posters' statement is this, while dual specs WILL make it easier to get runs going, it will only be effective among guild runs, PUGs will still have the problem of getting someone who's WILLING to PUG, let alone swap talents. This is half bad server community, and half the healer/tank being inexperienced/bad and/or unable to handle such pressure of the responsibility of their role and of the other party member's criticism.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is true, although GC did say they would consider extending it to other levels if it goes well. But yes I agree, everyone wants to level dps since it is faster which puts a hurt on lower level instance runs for tanks and healers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
-- Totally been dying to use this up to this point<br />
1) to break up the boring grind of levelling while allowing more 'instance friendly' spec'ing<br />
2) to allow for coming upon world pvp/getting camped [e.g. out of 'Prot-level' spec]<br />
<br />
-- TOTALLY KILLED!!!<br />
1) Nope, you must be max (80?!?!) level to use<br />
ARGUMENT IS YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO HANDLE IT?<br />
Really? I mean I don't want to get nasty, but are you F'in kiddin me?<br />
<br />
2) I thought this was even one of the suggested reasons this was coming<br />
NOPE! CAMP ME IF YOU SEE ME SWORD AND BOARD YOU MUTHAS! Argggghhhh....<br />
Even at max level if I was farming? NOPE! Git a group to change up you Git!<br />
<br />
Wow just wow... totally 100% fatality flat-lined my interest as <br />
* You must be level 80 to use<br />
* You must be in a group<br />
<br />
Read: I must play another MMO to have an easier respec time<br />
[NOT TROLLING but my Warhammer Online trial came at a good time I guess :b]<br />
<br />
I like a lot of what Blizzard has done, and dual spec I thought would re-ignite passion for the game, my alts.<br />
Instead, this was the biggest tease from them to date, crushing all my hopes for it with a level 80 in group requirement.<br />
&gt;:( :( ???<br />
<br />
<br />
Every instance 1-70 can be tanked or healed in a DPS spec. Cry more.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SFJake</div><div class="date">2009-02-12, 07:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I 100% agree. Its lame that you can't have dual spec before 80. I find the rest to be quite good, though. <br />
<br />
The absolute need for a party outside of town to switch is annoying, though understandable. There is absolutely no reasons you can't have dual spec before 80, however.<br />
<br />
EDIT: No one cares that &quot;lower level instances can be healed/tanks in DPS&quot;, which isn't always totally true. But its lame anyway. I wish I could level as a Shadow Priest and switch for instances in a true healing spec, thats funnier. Healing in shadow = more boring, even if it works.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think some people are confused about the group issue though. You don't have to be in a group to respec. Simply go to town and do it. The ONLY time you will need a group is if you want to respec in the field. That hardly seems like a limitation.</div></div><hr />

There isn't a single lower level 5-man instance that can't be done with offspecs. Shadow priests/ele shaman/boomkin healing ret pallies/fury/arms wars, etc. are easily done. That's what a ton of people in my guild did leveling and I'm sure a ton of other players as well. It isn't until heroics that people need to switch to realy healing/tank specs. Even then, there's a point where you outgear it enough that's it's painless to do it as an offspec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless, this is going to be a lot more fun for a lot of players, especially Hybrid classes. Although as a mage and scribe, I will totally enjoy the ability to switch specs depending on the fight/instance and not have many hassles about it. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
NOT<br />
<br />
THE<br />
<br />
POINT.<br />
<br />
A lot of people also refuse to, for example, heal if they have a DPS spec. Mostly, its often not as fun. For example, Holy or Disc priest brings more tools that just makes it more fun. Go Shadow and heal? More boring. Tanking in DPS spec as a pally? Boring.<br />

<br />
<br />
Prot Pallies and Prot warriors both are viable leveling specs. I went from 70 - 80 prot and tanked every dungeon i could so long as it was guildie's asking. <br />
<br />
I was healed by crit-chicken spec'd druids through some dungeons, and disc priests didn't seem too rare. Admitting - pure healers where rare. Just use whomever is willing - and Lots of crowd control :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
THE<br />
<br />
POINT.<br />
<br />
A lot of people also refuse to, for example, heal if they have a DPS spec. Mostly, its often not as fun. For example, Holy or Disc priest brings more tools that just makes it more fun. Go Shadow and heal? More boring. Tanking in DPS spec as a pally? Boring.<br />
<br />
We all know its doable, but I know some people and I know -I- want to heal/tank with the proper spec. Its simply MORE FUN.<br />

Then go respec. Your character won't be able to afford the thousands of gold to unlock dual specs anyway, so who cares.</div></div><hr />

Dual spec with possibilty of changing specs in middle of raids... Bad idea... Very bad idea...<br />

You should ALWAYS leave the isntance the same spec as you started it. There are gonna be ENDLESS problems with this if not. <br />

Dual spec as an idea to allow tanks to do PVP - yes !<br />

Dual spec to allow priests to switch from HOLY to DISC in same instance ... No !!<br />

This should really help with the problems of never being able to find a healer or a tank. As a warrior I'm now already starting to get some tanking gear so that I can start tanking when dual speccing comes out. I enjoy DPSing, hence why I'm not a tank at the moment.</div></div><hr />

Only? <br />
<br />
5k is a lot.<br />
<br />
This isn't as much of a useless luxury as an epic mount is. 1k is a much more logical price if anyone bothers to think about it, and to be honest even that is too high. Maybe too many people here think on a non-casual level, but my whole guild (which are mostly casuals) can't make a total of 3k from lvl 1 to 80.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">heerobya</div><div class="date">2009-02-12, 08:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">5k is a lot of gold to most people. <br />
<br />
As in people who don't visit forums and instead just &quot;play&quot; the game, which is probably the vast majority of people. <br />
<br />
My bet is it'll be much less the 1000g. Probably much less then 500g even. <br />
<br />
Otherwise, for those who only raid or only PvP or only farm/run heroics what's the point of spending that money? You're not going to be respecing enough for that to be a cheaper alternative anyway. <br />
<br />
I'm thinking around 250g will be what it ends up. <br />
<br />
Dual spec is NOT for the &quot;hardcore&quot; players who will already spend 500g a week on respecs. Those players have no problem spending 500g on respecs. Dual spec is going to be more for casual WoW players who want to do both PvE and PvP yet don't have the time to farm for the money to constantly respec. <br />
<br />
That being said....<br />
<br />
The raids are already designed around the idea that &quot;a tank is a tank&quot; and &quot;a healer is a healer&quot; with only one fight (OS+3) really needing a specific class for a specific role. <br />
<br />
Priests switching up between Holy and Disc or mages between Arcane/FfB etc. will not be a big issue for their design plans. Not at all. If anything it'll be expected that serious raiders will have a second spec saved and know what boss fights they need more AoE vs. more single target healing/dps/tanking for.<br />
<br />
Being able to summon a lexicon to allow free switching between fights is just a time saver. Otherwise it'll be mage ports to town then warlocks summons back. Just skip that step. It's pointless.</div></div><hr />

But no, instead they keep the need for you to run to a city to do it, excluding the need to pay a high respecc cost, or hope there's a inscriber in the group?

the problem is that often you wont find someone to tank for you, because they think that they cant without tank specc.

THE<br />
<br />
POINT.<br />
<br />
A lot of people also refuse to, for example, heal if they have a DPS spec. Mostly, its often not as fun. For example, Holy or Disc priest brings more tools that just makes it more fun. Go Shadow and heal? More boring. Tanking in DPS spec as a pally? Boring.<br />
<br />
We all know its doable, but I know some people and I know -I- want to heal/tank with the proper spec. Its simply MORE FUN.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also NOT THE POINT. Fun? Are you serious? Hell you don't even have all your tools for tanking till level 40 or so with most classes, Spec or not. The honest to god point is that people who don't want to tank (like myself) will not tank. My pally won't tank with dual spec or without, my pally won't tank while leveling. Not cause I give a crap about spec... but because I don't care for tanking. People who WANT to tank will tank with dual spec or without, and will tank while leveling.<br />
<br />
What this actually does it let people who WANT to tank or heal or dps AND WANT to do one of the others to be able to more easily do both, possibly do both even on the same raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As a PVE mage, I have a total lack of care on this whole issue, and would much rather see Blizzard focus their resources on improving WoW as a whole.<br />
<br />
That said, I'm avidly against hybrids on principle. This will just helps them distort the game further for pure dps classes. Not that I'm saying we wont benefit indirectly from more tanks/healers - but it will be indirectly, and at what cost?<br />
<br />
<br />
Hell as a PVE mage I think this is great. Now I can spec to frost for Chow kiting or farming then easily respec to FFB for the times where I want big numbers.<br />
<br />
But yes, this does help hybrids ALOT more than most. But it depends on your feelings on hybrids. I don't mind them at all. And tho indirect, a dropped tank or healer will kill most raids/groups cold. If I could switch out my shaman from damage to healing so that your mage can raid tonight period, that seems like a solid trade for my shaman not doing 20% less damage because I have the ablility to spend a ton of time and money gathering another set of gear so that I can change roles with one character.</div></div><hr />

Ghostcrawler: We will be launching the feature with just two specs, but depending on how we feel it works out, we might consider additional specs in the future.<br />
<br />
I really hope talent specs are like bank slots. The first one is dirt cheap, but additional ones quickly ramp up in cost. Not everyone needs a bunch of specs, but for hybrid classes who like to be the jack of all trades in pvp and pve, you'd still be respec'ing a bit. My shaman (currently pve resto) has at least 8 viable specs for pve and pvp, as well as group makeup (heroic/10/25man).<br />
<br />
Granted, having so many specs caters toward more min-maxing which Blizzard seems somewhat averse to. But with the changes coming in 3.1, such as giving my warlock replenishment but only in the middle of the destruction tree vs playing my preferred affliction spec, while having a pvp spec, even pure classes could see the need for more than just two specs.<br />
<br />
On that note, I think that pure dps classes that can offer replenishment should have replenishment in every tree. For example, in affliction, it could be tied with siphon life and for demonlogy, it could be tied with mana feed (but make it a better talent) or a center talent. Having raided half of BC as destruction, it's not a spec I want to return to anytime soon or be forced to return to for this almost mandatory raid buff.</div></div><hr />

You automatically make 2.5k gold going from level 70 to 80 just from quest rewards, not including mob drops or vendor trash etc. That was with full rested the whole way, so it would be more on a non-rested character who had to do more zones.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">K21Nova</div><div class="date">2009-02-12, 11:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">A few facts I'd like to point out here...<br />
<br />
First of all, we who use this site do not belong to the vast (think the amount of stars in all the galaxies in the universe kind of vast) majority who play this game. That's how mainstream the game has become.<br />
<br />
We, the ones with a level 80 character, or five, are in the minority. This minority on mmo-champion, and other such sites, largely comprises of raiders, or hard-core players, regardless of whether they raid or not.<br />
<br />
Even the community on the official forums is like a speck of dust in the universe compared to the soon 12 million people playing this game. Have you ever seen a forum with millions of users? I sure as hell haven't. There are hundreds of thousands at most, and more likely tens of thousands of users, at least active users, on the official forums. How many on mmo-champion? Doubt very much compared to the millions of players.<br />
<br />
So that's what everyone should keep in mind, regardless of what we're discussing. We, here on the forums, aren't the people Blizzard is developing this game for. We are above the masses in that we more often than not play a lot more and know a lot more than the average Joe. I personally don't even think of that as anything to brag about; I'd rather be the average Joe, who enjoys his computer game every now and then, but other than that doesn't really get that deep into it.<br />
<br />
Instead I, like so many of you, am a hard-core computer nerd. And that's not the majority of WoW players anymore.<br />
<br />
So, when someone says things like &quot;every leveling instance can be tanked and healed in a dps spec&quot;, they're not really using their brain. First of all, the average Joe, Joe the WoWzer if you will, most likely doesn't know his class well enough to be successful in off-spec tanking or healing.<br />
<br />
Secondly, some of us who do know the classes absolutely detest tanking or healing in off-spec. I mean... Leveling warrior, tanking as fury... Gah. Leveling priest, healing as shadow... Ugh. Sure, I can do it my eyes closed, but I'd rather shove rusty nails in my eyes.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Blizzard will see this sooner or later, and allow dual-speccing from at least 60 onward or so.<br />
<br />
Besides, if you have all these people leveling straight to 80 in their DPS spec, you end up with bad tanks and bad healers. Though, at least they've got an excuse; bad DPS' simply have no excuse whatsoever.<br />
<br />
If these leveling warriors and priests and druids and so forth were given dual-spec while they're leveling, and they could put points in their tanking/healing as well as DPS talent trees, they'd get experience in those roles.<br />
<br />
I was in the Nexus on my then 72 death knight a while back. I was full unholy, and was filling a DPS role. Our so-called &quot;tank&quot; was a level 70 death knight, full unholy, in full DPS gear, with 10-20 levels lower green pieces, and pieces with intellect, spirit and spell power on them. I pointed out this to the group, but they insisted we go on. He died to the first trash mob.<br />
<br />
Had he had the dual-spec system, he might have gotten himself some decent tanking gear, and a tanking spec, albeit as a DK there aren't that many talents you change, but still.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I digress. I'm quite happy we're getting the dual-spec system at last, and if it comes with extra bag space for the secondary gear, I'll be overjoyed, as my bags are pretty much full with soulbound items already. I'd personally like to see it given to leveling characters as well, though.</div></div><hr />

But my biggest issue is macros. For most of my toons I have macros set up that replace a lot of my talents. In some cases, there are just not enough personal macro slots to cover every macro that I use for more than one spec. I really hope that they will address this by allowing us to either assign macros to bars rather than a macro window, or give us more space to add extra macros for when we have two specs to switch between.<br />
<br />
I really don't look forward to editing my macros each time I switch between specs. It's a huge timesink.<br />
<br />
I guess one workaround is to save macro sets to text files and just rename the appropriate file to overwrite my current macros-cache one. XD</div></div><hr />

The first one is dirt cheap, but additional ones quickly ramp up in cost. Not everyone needs a bunch of specs, but for hybrid classes who like to be the jack of all trades in pvp and pve, you'd still be respec'ing a bit. My shaman (currently pve resto) has at least 8 viable specs for pve and pvp, as well as group makeup (heroic/10/25man).<br />
<br />
Granted, having so many specs caters toward more min-maxing which Blizzard seems somewhat averse to.<br />
<br />
I think all the dual-spec info sounds great! .... except for the possible idea of more specs than talent trees, that would devalue the uniqueness in selecting one tree.<br />
<br />
2 specs and 3 trees is perfect, it allows options but still means you have to choose between trees and leave one out.</div></div><hr />

Granted, having so many specs caters toward more min-maxing which Blizzard seems somewhat averse to. But with the changes coming in 3.1, such as giving my warlock replenishment but only in the middle of the destruction tree vs playing my preferred affliction spec, while having a pvp spec, even pure classes could see the need for more than just two specs.<br />
<br />
On that note, I think that pure dps classes that can offer replenishment should have replenishment in every tree. For example, in affliction, it could be tied with siphon life and for demonlogy, it could be tied with mana feed (but make it a better talent) or a center talent. Having raided half of BC as destruction, it's not a spec I want to return to anytime soon or be forced to return to for this almost mandatory raid buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the things I'd love to see added with dual speccing are bank slots for gear. Let's face it, especially with hybrids, you need to have tons of gear, especially if you pvp. I'd love to see some extra tabs for each number of specs you have. Basically enough for an extra set of gear.<br />
<br />
Thus changes specs, hit the bank, 1 click and you switch gear to your pvp set. As it is, every class typically carries (especially those who raid) keep multiple sets of gear for specific situations, and as thus room in bank slots are at an all time premium.<br />
<br />
Mages, at least that I know, carry gear for 10mans and 25, higher hps', pvp gear, extra +hit gear, etc..<br />
And add that the majority of classes are realistically hybrids and will need more slots to comprise extra gear.</div></div><hr />

If you're like me and respec at most twice times a month, it would be a loooong time before that 5k is better than the 50g fee. Hell, even if you respecced ten times a month at the maximal 50g fee, the time it take before you start losing money with respeccing VS the 5k fee for dual spec would be ten months if you kept that rate up. That's quite a long time.<br />
<br />
What if I need to respec during a dungeon/raid? Three words pal… Hearth. Or. Portal. <br />
<br />
It's already doable to quickly respec back in town thanks to summon stones and warlocks, and it'll be worth it to the party/raid to spend 5-10 min resummoning if they desperately need a tank/healer. Groups will be very unlikely to alienate players who don't have this feature, because there's no guarantee that when they decline someone who doesn't, they'll be able to find a tank/healer within a reasonable amount of time that does have dual spec…<br />

Very funny. Needless to say though I am so excited to finally see this coming. I really look forward to being able to swap and do some PvP while I main tank for the guild.

This won't change.

ret palas are still great. you can cover alot of buffs with them:<br />
+ mana reg buff<br />
+ 3% crit<br />
+ 3% haste<br />
+ judgment of wisdom or light<br />
+ 3% dmg <br />
and all this without gimping their dmg. (unlike the mage for example, who will have to specc loldps-frost)<br />

and palas arent the obvious choice for a respecc to holy, since they'll need to change all of their gear, while boomkin, shadowpriest and eleshamys only need to exchange a few things.</div></div><hr />

Those players have no problem spending 500g on respecs. Dual spec is going to be more for casual WoW players who want to do both PvE and PvP yet don't have the time to farm for the money to constantly respec. <br />
<br />
<br />
Actually I'd say it is for those people who respec a lot... they only pay 500g+ because the have to, not because they don't care. The current &quot;80-only&quot; status implies this a little as well.<br />
<br />
Casuals who can't be arsed to pony up the gold obviously don't care all that much to respec so this isn't going to impact them much.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What about loot rolls lets say a Pally respecs for 1 boss to OT but came in the raid as ret. Does he roll on tank gear, DPS gear or both? Unless people be very specific on loot rolls you are going to see lots of issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is a guild issue, so it's not likely to cause all that much drama afaik. But basically you bid dkp on your mainspec (your normal raiding spec), anything else is an offspec bid, period. In pugs just tell people they can roll on what gear matches the spec they were invited for having (i.e., you were invited because you're healing, so you can roll on healing gear), basically the same situation in the end - if they don't like it, then /kick.</div></div><hr />

We are going to provide hunters a new core ability to let them remotely access their stable on a long cooldown. This way if their exotic pet heads off to the stable, they will be able to get a different pet.<br />

<br />
I rly like this feature, although depends hugely on the length of the cooldown. If it would be 30min or longer, this feature would only be good if there isnt a stable around, but anyone could be in reach of a stable anywhere within 10minutes.

Let me put it this way, if they were planning on making it cost an arm and a leg, why would they even say they might allow it on lower level characters if its popular enough? Theres no way anyone but an alt of an 80(or i guess unleveled 70), would be able to pay a 5k gold dual spec fee without being 80 already and doing dailies.(or bought alot of gold, i suppose)<br />

It is perfectly possible to tank heroics in the blue saronite gear set without any hitches, too bad people are still in the TBC gear mindset. <br />
<br />
This change is very unlikely to make a sufficient enough players willing to tank or heal in general. This is something the WoW community itself has to change in order to remedy the problem.<br />
Completely agreed. I'm a druid, generally specced moonkin so i can just tell to all the random pug wispers who ask for tanks or healers : &quot;sorry wrong spec&quot;. Now i'm going to have to tell them &quot;i don't pug&quot; (except maybe if i see the guy i sfrom a known guild from our server).<br />
<br />
I don't want to do instances that last 2-3 times longer than they should and cost me money instead of winning me some. So i very rarely do pugs. And that's not going to change with the dual-spec, even though my 2nd spec is going to be resto.<br />
(i wouldn't be adverse to a 3rd spec for feral tanking either, but i still wouldn't pug)<br />
<br />
For those saying the GM's are now going to be able to ask the hybrids to respec to prot/holy/..., you might want to think a bit about what's stopping them to ask you for that currently ? Answer : nothing. If it's not happening now it won't be happening tomorrow either, the rets/fury/... were recruited with a certain purpose in mind and will be kept for that same purpose.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Isah</div><div class="date">2009-02-13, 11:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see 2 issues here:<br />
1) Limiting dual-specs to end level is annoying and ridiculous, but they will get complaints if it costs 250g for you to turn this feature on for your level 40.<br />
<br />
2) Hybrid classes will want between 3 and 5 specs. (e.g. Paladins: Ret PvE/PvE, Raid/PvP, Holy PvE/PvP, Prot. You could even argue that for certain fights Holy want a 51/17/0 build and a 51/5/12 build. So 6 specs would be good, but most will be fine with 3 specs.<br />
<br />
Again this is class specific. What they should do is something like the bank system where each 'bag' becomes progressively more expensive. This enables lower levels to have a cheap 'slot' and then when you hit 80 and you start to need more talent builds then these are purchasable.<br />
<br />
Ironically they will stick to letting people have one expensive talent build, the, get loads of people bitching when they eventually go down the above route.<br />
<br />
I do think Blizzard seem to forget that for many, it isn't about the end game, but exploring the years of content that is in the game. Restricting this to end-game is ridiculously short sighted. Last thing I need is a ret paladin suddenly deciding at 80 to &quot;try this tanking shit&quot;. I'd prefer if he'd had tried out all trees before hitting the end-game.</div></div><hr />

Be happy that they are giving you one extra spec, just because a paladin can fill many roles doesn't mean they should give them 3 to 5 specs. A warrior might want to do a Arms Pve/PvP, Fury PvE and Prot PvE/PvP as well. That's 5 and a warrior isn't even a hybrid. <br />

If you're not willing to pug, don't do it. I'm sure there are people who do and who will use the opportunity to tank instead of DPS, or the other way around.</div></div><hr />

Technically, it doesn’t fit in their solution. Ok. Pretending people might not handle or understand this functionality until 80 is lame and is almost insulting to players.<br />

The argument being that low-levels must focus on learning their class. Don't you learn more if you have dual specs? To be able to be a decent tank or healer and not only dps-leveling?<br />
I didn't do many dungeons as shadow cause I felt like not a &quot;real&quot; healer even though I could be one. If I rather easily could have changed to disc or holy I probably would have done more of them, just for fun and for practise. <br />
I will have to learn to heal better at lvl 80, and I think that's a bit too late. That probably goes for many classes. <br />
<br />
Also, shouldn't the game be enjoyable at all levels, people hanging around everywhere? Instead of powerleveling as fast as possible to reach 80 just take it easy and enjoy the game. For example, be lvl 50 and stay there for a while doing dungeons and some quests and having fun and then go for some more leveling?<br />
<br />
For example, I feel like outland has been a bit forgotten. People go there but leave asap and the dungeons being meaningless because the gear being useless in northrend at 68. Being able to use dual specs on lower levels probably would make the game more enjoyable and also would make all the different zones more fun to stay in.</div></div><hr />

They start testing it on a PTR to see how it works out befor they put it on all realms, but the first time its on all realms is also a test, just a later phase of testing. SO to have it limited to the lvl 80 players at first is a smart thing to do. This way you are testing on the players that already know more of the game, and do not bugg the players that might be new to WoW yet.<br />
<br />
GC even told you, depending on how popular it is it may be made possible for lower lvls too.<br />
And even if they do i still susspect it will be something like at lvl 40-50 you can get it. Befor that you are just testing everything on the new class you play anyways or just learning the game, depending on if its a toon made on a new class or a new player to WoW. At that lvl it will also be snuggly between your 60% and 100% mount as well as being at the 31-41 point speccs when speccing becomes more important to look at.<br />
<br />
I myself really look forward to this feature. Sure i can see some negativety with it. Like that pugs might turn out to become worse. But we'll just have to see about that.<br />
<br />
I see myself as a casual harcorer. That is, I know more of the game then is healty but i like playing it on a casual lvl. I can see how this dual spec will be great for both harcores and casuals. My casual part would like to explore all the game has to offer in the end, but as that part is not hardcore i do not want to go around spending a lot of money on respeccing for a respecc i might only want for a week or so. For a casual player this will be a great feature to test aditional parts of the game from day to day instead of feeling the need to remain on that one spec your already good at because the harcores get so irritated if YOU wanna try something new. As for the hardcore players, yeah i can see how this would be great in raiding. Specially if you have a guild for 25 mans, the grouping for 2 10-man groups will be made easeyer and also just going changing from dps to healer or tank when its needed in a single raid can be handy. Also the doing dailys might get easyer for you to get your money for pots elixers food and the like by having one specc that is better for soloing and then your other specc you use in your raid.<br />
<br />
Finaly for all you pure classes, this is still a feature to look forward too, sure you might not get out of it as much as the hybrids, but as a mage you can finaly go frost to make the farming of stuff much easyer and go back to raiding specc once its time for that, or to finaly have that pvp spec you want wile you still really want and like the raiding you do with your guild. You rogues get your prefect pvp specc and a perfect pve spec combo if you want, or just a solo-trash killing specc and then a raiding specc for when you get fights that will actually last longer then 1-3 rotations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But generally speaking I like the feature. Also that gear manager is very interesting. I used to have a bank full of gear back in TBC like 3 healing gear sets, PvP gear Resto and Feral, Feral Bear gear, Cat gear... :) It is madness.</div></div><hr />

People need stop QQing that was a statement made at the dual specs current state. GC is going to read all the QQ on the forums and adjust it to lower levels. its just beginning at 80 for testing purposes. Likely they will push is down to level 20 or 30, you don't really need another spec until this point anyways. If you cant heal or tank RFC, DeadM, WC, Stockades, SFK, RFK ect as your dps spec, you fail at wow, no instance is healing or tank intesive till outlands. Even then its not very intensive.</div></div><hr />

as for 5 spec or 3 or anything more than two it doesn't make a sense, as we have 3 trees and they are there so we MUST choose if i can choose all of them just get rid of them all together.<br />
<br />
it's great change in my opinion and gives a lot of opportunities to everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A hybrid to Blizzard's eyes but I don't really see a true hybrid as something that would still do pure physical dps with more or less survivability and more or less dps. More like a semi hybrid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I know ppl that respec 3 times a day and when you add in the price of Glyphs (around 60g-100g) It adds up fast,<br />
and dual spec isn't going in to save you money its going in to save time and hassle of respecing. I just said 5k because thats what it cost for an epic flyer back in TBC. I remeber thinking back then OMG thats crazy amount. Its really not that bad of a price if you do your dailies you can get that kinda of money in like 1-3 weeks. being a hunter myself i don't really see a need for a dual spec.</div></div><hr />

They aren't going to charge 5000g. I am thinking 500g-1000g. You are right, money is easy to make if you know how to farm/use your professions. I can make over 2000g in 3 hours. That aside people would rather pay once and a while. Most people who raid and have 2 specs they prefer will choose these 2. healing/Dps, Tanking/Dps, Tanking/Healing, ect, same for pvp'ers and pve/pvp'ers. Its making peoples lives easier who don't have the time to farm, the people who work 9-5 that eat supper with their families and only log on around raid time (that is one example). You can't assume everyone has time to spend 3+ hours a night besides raiding/pvping for money making.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cptrugged</div><div class="date">2009-02-13, 02:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The main argument for this change was that, once specced, the hybrids are &quot;pure&quot; classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
That wasn't the main argument at all. The main argument was that particular specs were designed to do a particular role. These specs were given as an option but weren't really an option because they did these role SO poorly compared to other classes doing the same role, the specs were seldom utilized for the role the were intended in high level play at all.<br />
<br />
And realistically, the real things that keep people from respecing isn't the 50gld. Its play preference and gear. It takes alot to gear up a character well. And gearing up an off spec slow as others are still getting thier main specs. And this is only IF they WANT to switch in the first place. Unless you are in some hard core min/maxxer guild, most aren't going to be making edicts to spec a certain way. And if you're in a guild like that, you were doing it now most likely anyway whenever EJ posts thier latest numbers.</div></div><hr />

True but they Cater to majority, half the population has a character at cap, thus they can justify the higher cost. Likely if they drop the level requirement they will have the cost scale and or they will charge a minimal fee.</div></div><hr />

If you're like me and respec at most twice times a month, it would be a loooong time before that 5k is better than the 50g fee. Hell, even if you respecced ten times a month at the maximal 50g fee, the time it take before you start losing money with respeccing VS the 5k fee for dual spec would be ten months if you kept that rate up. That's quite a long time.<br />
It has to be near dirt cheap or most people won't bother using it. Period.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
Hence why I predict it'll be about 250g to save your 2nd spec. It'll be a non-issue for a more &quot;hardcore&quot; player who didn't mind the 50g per respec cost before. It'll be a non-issue for the more casual players too as 250g isn't a lot of gold to make to use this great feature.<br />
<br />
It'll increase the tanks and healers available for pugs.<br />
<br />
You KNOW if they are releasing dual spec on the same patch as Ulduar they are designing Ulduar to account for the fact that when you only need 1 tank, the other tanks will likely switch to a dps spec and such. <br />
<br />

Spending 5k doesnt save money at all, and although some ppl respec 3 times in 1 hour, most ppl do not. I respec only when Blizzard decides to nerf my current spec to oblivion. Imo this ability shouldnt cost anything.<br />
<br />
When this dual spec is implemented the whole Mainspec/Offspec will be gone, because anyone can claim anything now. Now i actually have to worry to be outrolled on a DPS weapon by a Holy paladin or Resto Shaman who can have their occasional fun in bgs as a DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The prerequisite that you need a Lexicon (or a scribe to make the item) straight up gimps this. The only complaint I just read in this thread had the scribe replying how it's unfair his profession doesn't get to make money. Yeah, like nobody buys glyphs? Engineers are in the same boat. All this guarantees is that about 2000 Lexicon summoning items come the day of the patch on the AH for 4000g+ each and nobody will be able to afford them and the feature will remain largely unused. All this system will do is turn what would have been a huge game-changing feature into another money sink, and that alone is just a failure. <br />
<br />
I will put it into better terms, such as how this affects me - I play a Death Knight tank at the moment and I am occasionally required to go DPS because some encounters simply do not require another tank in the raid. Spec switching would have meant the times I am not tanking things that I could simply switch to my DPS spec and switch my gear out and just carry on as I wish - ideally I should not have to have 4 other people clicking a portal just to achieve this. Granted it's not the end of the world, but it's just not quite what I envisioned and I'm sorely disappointed. <br />
<br />
I see no need to have to summon a lexicon to switch spec. My biggest concern is the cost of these portable lexicons, and second is the 'it's a multiplayer game! Do something together!' mechanic thrown in. <br />
<br />
Chances are it'll work out to be alright and manageable, it usually does, but I really felt the need to complain about how this isn't quite the convenient mechanic Blizz suggested they wanted to create.</div></div><hr />

The scribes in your guild will gouge you 4k gold? Additionally, i doubt many people will pay 4k gold when they can walk to a lexicon. The number of people that will WANT an on-demand respec while outside of major cities and have the players to summon the object will most likely be limited to raids, and occaisionally a 10man.<br />
<br />
And if you dont have 1 of those doodads in the raid. Either get a port(or if no mage, hearth), and have a warlock summon you back. Hit the lexicon. /done.</div></div><hr />

The thing is, this change is primary aimed at everyone, including casuals. <br />
<br />
5000g may not be a lot to the more hardcore players, but it's practically several limbs to many casuals. Many casual players don't have that much money because if they're like me, they usually have something they need to spend that gold on right away. It's kinda silly to propose a change that is supposed to be for everyone but have a requirement that's only reasonable to the hardcore.</div></div><hr />

Does he roll on tank gear, DPS gear or both? Unless people be very specific on loot rolls you are going to see lots of issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't a hard concept to understand, our pug's have experienced this issue before.<br />
<br />
Let's Say Your Example Pally is Ret DPS for Boss #1, but tank for Boss #2<br />
<br />
Example Pally was Ret for the First Boss, so he rolls on DPS Gear for that boss. <br />
<br />
Since Example Pally Tanked Boss #2 he would roll on Tank gear for that boss.<br />
<br />
Let's add in that he switched to Holy.<br />
<br />
Boss #3, Example Pally heals. He would roll on Healer Gear for that boss.<br />
<br />
Point: Whatever Role you CURRENTLY are for whatever drops/Boss Fights, is what you roll for.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
GM: Hey Warrior, whats your role in this fight?<br />
WAR: It's dps.<br />
GM: Ok roll on dps gear for this fight.<br />
WAR: Cool, Can I tank next boss?<br />
GM: Sure, but then you roll for Tank loot for that fight.<br />

Not to mention cards are still popular. <br />
<br />
I just disagree with a summon respec portal thing.. Honestly... Put a 5-10 minute cool down on the ability to switch, not in combat, not in an arena.. I don't see how allowing every person to switch for every single fight to better fit raid composition is overpowered.</div></div><hr />

This is a terrible example. I imagine most high-end non retarded guilds will still have most players as a main spec. Then you have your 2nd or Off spec as next choice.. Just now off spec will have a pertinent role in raids rather than for free time or 10 mans.</div></div><hr />

WHAT THE HELL?<br />
<br />
I created an account to say how terrible an idea this is....<br />
<br />
Alright, so let me get this straight... I run a raid as DPS, I DPS all the way through... and on the final boss, you need an extra tank, so I switch, and now there's a great DPS weapon drop, you're gonna tell me no? No fair guild / group would EVER do this. The only thing that'll change now will be possibly be a new level of priority....<br />
<br />
1st Priority: Main Spec<br />
2nd Priority: 2nd Spec<br />
3rd Priority: Off Spec,<br />
<br />
Any good guild will always spec to the greatest benefit of the guild. Gearing the best gear to someone who will only use it 1/20 fights isn't going to benefit the guild. Even guilds that use DKP, if they player isn't completely retarded jerk, wouldn't roll on an exceptionally good healing weapon for a 2nd spec, when there are still main spec healers who need it.</div></div><hr />

I was really jazzed about this feature, but it's really gone the other way now - very disappointing<br />
<br />
<br />
1) You only have to be in a group if you want to switch specs in the field.<br />
2) You bought a land mount when you got high enough, you bought flying mount when you got high enough, you bought cold weather flying when you got high enough, so why wouldn't you pay for dual specs when you get high enough?<br />
<br />
How often are you really expecting to be changing specs in the field when not in a group?<br />
<br />
&quot;Oh look, there's a mob, let's switch to DPS And kill&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh look, there's 2 mobs, let's switch to tank and kill&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh look, I'm at 80% health, let me switch to healer spec&quot;<br />
&quot;Oh look, there's a flower, let's switch to PvP gear while I loot it incase anyone's around...&quot;<br />
<br />
You've managed to get all your levels currently without dual specs, you can continue to do so. I would however, also love to get dual specs around 60.<br />
<br />
What they've done is quite simple:<br />
<br />
They've reduced the cost and hastle of respeccing between your two most common specs.<br />
<br />
It's that simple. Why is this a bad thing?<br />
<br />
If Blizzard ever announced that they were going to reduce the monthly subscription cost, I swear half of y'all would complain &quot;It's not low enough.&quot; and the other half will complain &quot;The lower cost will let more noobs in.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dual spec with possibilty of changing specs in middle of raids... Bad idea... Very bad idea...<br />
<br />
You should ALWAYS leave the isntance the same spec as you started it. There are gonna be ENDLESS problems with this if not. <br />
<br />
Dual spec as an idea to allow tanks to do PVP - yes !<br />
<br />
Dual spec to allow priests to switch from HOLY to DISC in same instance ... No !!<br />
<br />
It creates TOTALLY new balancing problems that will take years to recover from. This will piss more ppl off than it will please. <br />
<br />
<br />
Uh.... what? You're a complete retard, why the fuck would it matter if someone can respec for a boss? Blizzard already said they aren't going to make a fight that requires 15 healers because of this. Also, Holy-&gt;Disc is a problem? Are you functionally impaired?<br />
<br />
News@11: PVE is hard, and it matters if your class does 100 less DPS/HPS than another for &quot;balance.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It won't be cash, nothing in the game currently requires you to pay extra money to unlock gameplay features. <br />
<br />
It won't be achievement points, it's not like you can 'pay' your achievement points from completing a dungeon, and try to get them back. Now this doesn't mean that there might not be an acheivement requirement for this, not unlike the epic patterns unlocked for tailors, but you won't be paying a 'fee' with them.<br />
<br />
It will 99.99% be gold, and possibly some quest items.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tiredhealer</div><div class="date">2009-02-13, 11:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Priests switching up between Holy and Disc or mages between Arcane/FfB etc. will not be a big issue for their design plans. Not at all. If anything it'll be expected that serious raiders will have a second spec saved and know what boss fights they need more AoE vs. more single target healing/dps/tanking for.<br />
<br />
The only real issue will be class balance, would it not be better to have healers with two healing specs, both direct and AoE, will it not be better to have dps that have both a ranged and melee spec? The way fights are now some favor direct healing and some AoE, while some fights favor melee and some ranged. How will Blizz balance this, if i were a raid leader i would want classes that have two specs in their current job, be it healing or dps. <br />
<br />
I don't know much about DK's, do they have more than one tanking spec? Maybe one that negates more magic and one that negates more physical damage. If so, this could also impact your choice of tanks?<br />
<br />
No one can know the future, but if the past is an indicator of the future, there will be a lot of unseen ramifications with dual spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I just hope the gold cost won't be too severe , no more than say 100 or 200g.<br />
<br />
I play a Hunter, DK* and Pally*, I've pretty much worked out what specs to swtch between;<br />
<br />
Hunter: Surv &amp; MM<br />
Paladin: Ret &amp; Holy or the other one (Subject to guild needs)<br />
Death Knight: Frost, maybe blood &amp; unholy (Subject to guild needs)<br />
<br />
* Not yet at max level, but should be within next few weeks</div></div><hr />

I'm really happy with the system that's coming in. My major fear was people doing what i just said.. especially in 25 mans when it gets very confusing to remember who's doing what role.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just a suggestion, Maybe Blizz can make it so The Portable Lexicon of Power is destroyed after its one use IF you are not a 450 inscriptionist.<br />
<br />
So, if you are 450 Inscriber, it will not be destroyed. Just goes away after its duration with a cooldown. <br />
<br />
Those who do not have 450 Inscription, can only use it once with the same cooldown or longer. <br />
<br />
;-)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe Blizz will make the cost of dual specs 5k, and cap the normal respec at 250 gold, or more, to give people motivation to pay the 5k.</div></div><hr />
