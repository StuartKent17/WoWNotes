Windsong and Elemental Force Information<br />
But now can you explain why Black Magic still procs from just targeting enemies?<br />
This isn't really related to this topic, but we'll look into it.<br />
<br />
Is it intended that these enchants can be better than the Sha Crystal equivalents, ie: Jade Spirit?<br />
It's intended that they're very viable enchants, but the top tier (Sha Crystal) enchants should usually win, on average. But there may be exceptions in certain situations.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the info Daxx, but could you clarify a little more on Windsong - is it 2RPPM PER effect (haste proc, Crit Proc, Mastery Proc) - thus essentially 6RPPM among the 3 different buffs it can proc, or 2RPPM to get A proc at random?<br />
Windsong is 2 RPPM total and the buff applied is totally random. Each time it procs, you randomly get 1 of 3 buffs.<br />
<br />
How does this apply to Guardians and Ferals?<br />
The same way it applies to everyone else. Swing speed is not a factor in this proc mechanic.<br />
<br />
As a dual wielding melee, I would frequently see double and sometimes even a triple proc of Windsong rolling at once, if only for a few brief seconds. And even outside of getting double procs, it was up quite often. Does this new proc design for Windsong mean I'm going to see a decrease in procs, and thus a decrease in stacked up procs?<br />
It should proc roughly as frequently as it did before for a rogue, and this change has no impact on its ability to stack. It is fully intended that Windsong’s 3 different buffs can stack with each other, but each is a result of a separate proc event.<br />
<br />
My only question about the &quot;Real PPM&quot; is if the new system ONLY applies to...<br />
This new proc mechanic is only used for Windsong and Elemental Force currently. Depending on how it works, we may use it for more procs going forward, but are unlikely to apply it to previous procs. We chose to apply it to Windsong and Elemental Force because their existing proc mechanic was problematic and significantly underperforming for a many of its intended users, so the change was almost universally a buff.<br />
<br />
Windsong procs on my Recuperate tics and breaks me out of stealth. Quite troublesome in PVE and PVP situations.<br />
This sounds like a bug. We'll investigate and fix if necessary. These sort of procs should not break stealth.<br />
<br />
So what you are saying is that we are penalized if our class does not favor haste over mastery and crit? How is this in any way a good idea?<br />
No, we're saying that one of haste's benefits is giving you more procs, which has always been the case, and we wanted to preserve that.<br />
<br />
So after 10 seconds, it takes Around 3-4 swings, Ticks, casts, etc should proc it, baring any RNG God Hate. Since The buff is 12 Seconds, its close to 100% uptime?<br />
I think you're misreading 'time since the last chance to proc' as 'time since the last proc'. That's a very important distinction.<br />
<br />
How does this interact with swapping weapons with different enchants? I'd hope TSLP is reset on weapon swap, so that weapon swapping is not promoted.<br />
Equipping a weapon resets the time since the last chance to proc in this case, so a weapon swap does not gain you additional procs.<br />
<br />
The question for comes up for dual wielders with it on both weapons. Does it count each weapon's enchant only for attacks made with that weapon or does having it on both weapons cause every attack to reset the counter?<br />
Both weapons' attacks can proc both enchants. You can think of dual wielding Windsong enchanted weapons as having a second chance (at the same proc chance) at each damage event. And yes, both can proc from the same event; you could indeed have two Windsong procs from one attack. <br />
<br />
By haste, do you guys mean haste rating, total haste effects, or attack speed?<br />
Ah, that’s a good thing to clarify. Thanks for bringing that up. In this case, it refers to the highest of your casting speed multiplier, or your attack speed multiplier. So, haste rating, increased attack speed effects (such as the attack speed raid buff), pure haste (such as Heroism or Bloodlust), or even Mind-Numbing Poison will all affect it.<br />
<br />
Also, a minor clarification from the original post:<br />
<br />
Windsong is now a useful enchant for all classes and specs<br />
*Except Hunters, since they use scopes instead of weapon enchants. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/240336-windsong-and-elemental-force-information/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6893549789?page=4#67))<br />

Mogu'shan Vaults LFR Part 2<br />
470 minimum i-lvl?<br />
The second half of Mogu'shan Vaults is the same as the first half. The required item level players must have is 460.<br />
<br />
Once Heart of Fear and Terrace of Endless Spring open up, they will have a required item level of 470, with both raid dungeons dropping improved gear.

<br />
Cross-Realm Zones Feedback<br />
If you find a persistent group of players giving you trouble, there should be a few friendly level 90 players of your own faction willing to help out.<br />
<br />
With respect, how is that a reliable plan A?<br />
With equal respect, I'd say it's at the very least plan B. Plan A is when you select a PvP realm to level on in the first place, knowing full-well that members of the opposing faction will be able to attack you at any point, but being okay with that (else, why would you make a character there?).<br />
<br />
It was purely my suggestion on how to combat gankers. Another idea might be to call in some friends or guild members, or go make a cup of tea and leave them to get bored. Maybe go and log your main, come back and dish out some revenge? These are all tactics that have been around forever on how to deal with gankers. I realise it's frustrating, I've been there myself many a time, but I knew what I was getting into when I rolled there. Some people love the danger of levelling on a PvP server. If it's not for you, there are plenty of alternative options.<br />
<br />
I want to stress that I'm not dismissing your thoughts on this at all, I'm just getting into the conversation as a player myself. We do want to hear your continued feedback. But please be aware that ganking, having to wait for mobs to spawn and sharing mineral nodes are all things that figure into an MMO, and they've been factors to consider in WoW from the start. Obviously, having said that, we are of course monitoring the situation and will keep you posted if we decide to tweak anything further.

Bag space issue<br />
Wow, really impressed with some of these ideas! I still see people suggesting bigger banks and bags though. That's only going to resolve the problem for a little while. We'd be back in exactly the same position once everyone got used to the extra space, which is kinda what's happening each time bigger bags are introduced. <br />
<br />
But yeah, loving some of the things you're all coming up with! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/239692-bag-space-issue/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5585788609?page=10#181))<br />
<br />
Warrior and Hunter Changes<br />
There have already been a number of changes made and issues fixed with hunters and warriors. Hunters have had a couple of bug fixes, a nerf and some other changes happen to their class, this should tone down their burst and healing done through Spirit Mend from Stampede. Warriors have had their Charge and Warbringer stuns changed so that they now correctly apply diminishing returns which should help with lowering their ability to lock down a target in stuns.<br />
<br />
We are watching to see how these and other hotfixes will play out on the live realms and hope to see a positive effect from them. There are also several changes that we want to test out on the PTR, but they may be deployed earlier than patch 5.1.

Garajal Heroic Adds<br />
Doesn't matter wether or not its doable, rather how much harder it is compared to 25 man, yet again, speaking through numbers. The adds in the spirit totem has about 200k health more than the 10 man ones, and spawn as much as on 10 man, only that already is enough to say that 10 man is overtuned seeing as the mobs health isnt even duplicated.<br />
Adds on 10-man heroic spawn at a slower rate than 25-man normal. <br />
<br />
On 10-man, however, when several Shadowy Minions are active, there's more potential for busrt damage from then than on 25-man. That's something the devs are evaluating and may adjust.

Blue Tweets<br />
Patch 5.1<br />
Does the Brawler's Guild allow non-level 90?<br />
Pretty sure it is for 90s. <br />
<br />
PvE<br />
What if you never do normal 5 mans and you need gear for heroics? <br />
Gearing for heroics: Dread Waste blues, JP or HP items, crafted blues, scen items (esp Arena). We also lowered required ilevel. <br />
<br />
Is racing to tag the 'Sha of Anger' the intended way of doing the encounter? It just feels so.. frustrating. <br />
We've made many Sha changes lately to help. Competition: good. Competition over who spams AE for a first tap: less good. <br />
Wouldn't this be the same as Galleon. Doesn't seem like World Bosses are fulfilling their role all that well. <br />
Galleon is targeted more at organized groups. Sha of Anger is more for everyone, sort of like Archavon. Sort of. <br />
Do away with tagging entirely, give loot rights to anyone contributing. World bosses should promote cooperation, not griefing. <br />
Quest bosses do let you contribute. We want world bosses to be competitive though - that's what makes them not pinatas. <br />
<br />
Mob tagging on regular mobs feels outdated in MMO design and makes players hate other players. <br />
Agree, but the counterpoint is that zerging every mob in a zone doesn't feel very heroic either. The group tap mobs evaporate. <br />
<br />
Why is LFR the best way to get valor points? 45 for the clear + the bosses beats out even doing them on normal/heroic <br />
I have seen very few raiders have trouble capping valor for the week.<br />
<br />
Will valor rewards be tied to rep grinds in future patches? It doesn't seem very optional for raiders, and isn't fun for many. <br />
Raiders run out of Valor purchases quickly and other players are probably progressing at a much slower pace than you expect. <br />
<br />
Running dungeons as a windwalker I swear LFD puts me with a rogue every time. Didn't it use to look outside your armor class? <br />
It tries to, but we emphasize faster queues over perfect groups (esp when queues aren't so fast). Many monks right now. <br />
<br />
I hear 90s can't queue for normal 5mans. Pity, because that's what I used to learn a new spec that was tank or healer<br />
Players only tended to run the normals once or twice though. The heroics are pretty forgiving. <br />
Was there something prohibitive with the feature in Cata? Because 85s in Cata could queue for normals.... <br />
It would have been nice for 90s to be able to queue for Mogu'shan. Wish we had done that. <br />
<br />
Scenarios appear to be the best idea you guys have ever had. So great for quick playing, also tons of fun to chain queue. <br />
They work well for DPS because you can queue for dungeons and hopefully it will be ready by the time the scenario is done. <br />
<br />
Have you guys considered replacing the Holiday dungeon bosses and some of the outdated events with Scenarios? <br />
That's a great idea! Have only scratched surface of what scenarios can do - will do more with them in future. <br />
<br />
Scenarios in Mists use only 3 players, but the tech is capable of more. We will definitely experiment. 40-player missions? It's possible!<br />

<br />
What Mione posted, first kills always wait until another kill for a video to be released - and if they want it to look good it needs a bit of editing.<br />
If a second kill just uploads a 1 pov video with music put over it it will always be released faster if they kill it a day after.<br />
<br />
Also Nik, don't trust Youtube's sorting. It sorts by day and not based on the exact time a video is posted. You`re making a pretty big fool out off yourself (not that you haven't done that yet lol!) by saying they were the actual first to be released.</div></div><hr />

He's got a point with the competition. In GW2, you zerg and zerg and zerg and zerg, then everyone runs off and gets the exact same reward from a node. Having played it, I still prefer the competition for rare mobs and nodes, especially nodes considering the economy. At that, we have 2 factions in WoW, having them being sharebears would be moronic. Let ALL questmobs and objectives be fulfilled by other Alliance players without a group? Sure, but having it be that way with both factions? No. Sharing rare spawn loot and nodes with everyone? No thank you, I like having gathering professions on my alt for that very task.<br />
<br />
You can bet your behind that if they wanted to, they could do it quite easily. But what GW2 did ain't exactly the best solution just because it worked in THAT game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because there are no hardcore 10 man guilds that raid 24/7 since the progress started. 25 man hardcore guilds have been there since the dawn of ages, hence to why there's so many of them killing it. Paragon is basically the only competition 10 man wise and even they stated that 10 man was really easy and that they don't get it why more people haven't killed it on 10 man. It took paragon to down the bosses in 2 days, and if you split the time invested and 10 mans raiding on a more relaxed schedule you will end up getting roughly the same amount of time invested.</div></div><hr />

What an ignorant thing to say, made almost offensive by the sheer scope of it's ignorance! How dare you, sir or madame!<br />
Seriously though, WOW's trading card art is created by independent free lance artists, they do not work for Blizzard. <br />
Blizzard's concept artists have been a small team from the start, and Blizzard is desperate for more that can actually work within their style. They aren't firing anybody in the art team, and they never did. A few of their concept artists have contributed to the card game. <br />
And the card game has had hundreds of brand new art pieces done for every single release, and the newest release is about to come out. Why they keeep showing old art, I don't know, but you're acting like they don't make new art anymore, and that's just silly. <br />
<br />
If you want to see Blizzard's offical concept artists, go to Sonsofthestorm.com</div></div><hr />

Thats just bullshit, all the kill videos were released AGES ago, if any kill vids should have been put on front page it should be Paragon/Method and if we take into account the shitty bias by MMOC it should have been Vodkas video. Under no circumstance should it be the video from Blood Legion but I wouldnt be surprised if Blood Legion payed Curse to pull this shit off. I guess that just proves that MMOC is no longer a serious place to go if you want WoW news.</div></div><hr />

Wouldn't be any different from the other WoW sites TBH.</div></div><hr />

For example, if I have 6 friends who want to go, we'd select 6 players from a dropdown before queueing, or just look at how many are in the party/raid. <br />
<br />
In LOTRO, scenarios (called skirmishes) have scaleable difficulty as well, so more difficult = more badges, or Valor in WoW's case.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Freia</div><div class="date">2012-10-16, 04:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">14 kills. 12 in 25 man and 2 in 10 man. Guess we can put the discussion to rest now about whats easiest. The numbers have spoken<br />
<br />
No they haven't. Most of the top tier guilds are 25m. Paragon said it themselves during tier 11 back when you saw few 10m kills. That the kills required a lot of min/maxing and class stacking and most of the guilds that have those options available to them are running 25m.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Smoopie</div><div class="date">2012-10-16, 04:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">10 and 25 are competitive and challenging in their own rights<br />
<br />
There are two categories, world first 25 and world first 10 man. <br />
There is no longer a world first overall, both sizes have their obstacles and they are too dissimilar to compare. <br />
<br />
<br />
The reason more 25 man heroics have been cleared is a simple one, more raiders prefer 25. Paragon themselves said they would be raiding 25 if they could field a team. 25 has been the focus for so long, most of the skilled players still raid 25.<br />
<br />
You don’t have many 10 man guilds with the same caliber of player.<br />
<br />
And I’m not saying if the 25 guilds raided 10 they would clear it any faster, I’m just saying more skilled players are currently raiding 25 than 10 man right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don’t even know if people are trolling or not anymore.. I give up.</div></div><hr />

I was impressed with both of their executions and noticed the different ways their respective raid teams handled adds. I was particularly impressed with Method's use of Gorefiend's Grasp + AoE stun to stack adds perfectly for burning them down. Blood Legion may not be a top 3 kill, but it was still a video for MMO to post. I believe Method has an agreement with Wowhead, so Curse probably couldn't post it here.</div></div><hr />

Random Blue post by Boubouille Published on 2012-10-11 05:54 PM<br />
<br />
Even worse is the method kill which is half way through some super long post so the people who only look at the top of the page never saw that on the front page.<br />
<br />
Im not sure why mmoc has such a bias towards US guilds, boubouille is from france so he should be rooting for the EU guilds right?<br />
<br />
Indeed, I guess it's time to find a more unbiased site to visit when it comes to WoW because this shit is just pathetic and unfair to the real winners. But it comforts me that Blood Legion must be still raging at each other for all the preparation they did on beta and still not being able to win. They they made a huge fuss about how they would win and that they thought they were the most prepared guild coming into this (yeah right), Paragon and Method says hi!</div></div><hr />

Also what happened to all the guild's Spirit King videos?<br />
