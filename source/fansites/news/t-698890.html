As many of you know from panels at last year’s BlizzCon and posts here on the forums since then, Cataclysm will bring about major changes to familiar character stats such as Intellect, Armor Penetration, Defense, and others, ultimately designed to make the effects of stats more easily understandable and make gear choices more interesting. As these changes will have a significant impact on how stats work and relate to one another, today we wanted to offer you a closer look at exactly what’s in store and explain some of the rationale before Cataclysm arrives.<br />
<br />
The most obvious question these changes raise is &quot;Why are stats being changed, and why now?&quot; As the game has matured, we've run into increasingly complex issues with the current stat system. Many stats are inherently confusing, and the way they interrelate can feel convoluted. Attack Power, for example, currently translates to damage, but so does Armor Penetration. Defense provides five different statistical benefits of varying utility. Mana regeneration involves understanding multiple stats and rules and often ends up being irrelevant anyway. In addition, the difference between a &quot;good stat&quot; for a class and a &quot;bad stat&quot; can be extreme. Some casters want Haste but not Crit; hunters want Armor Penetration but not Haste. There are other overarching issues, as well, such as Intellect not being very exciting for casters despite it being a core stat -- and these are just a few examples.<br />
<br />
Our ultimate goal is make gear a more interesting (and less confusing) choice by making each stat valuable to more players. While the reasoning behind some of the following changes may be clear, we understand that you may have questions about some of the less obvious alterations, and we'll do our best to answer any questions you may have here on the forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
[b]What You’ll See on Gear<br />
<br />
Stamina - Because of the way we will be assigning Strength, Agility, and Intellect, non-plate wearers will end up with more Stamina than before. Health pools will be much closer between plate-wearers and other classes.<br />
<br />
Spirit - Come Cataclysm, this stat should only be found on healing gear. Non-healing casters will have other systems in place to regenerate mana, and we are designing special solutions for Elemental shaman and Balance druids who often share gear with healers (more on this below). Raid buffs that currently boost Spirit (such as Blessing of Kings) will only boost the primary stats of Stamina, Strength, Agility, and Intellect. We are also likely changing the five-second rule and other quirks of the current regen system.<br />
<br />
Intellect - Intellect will now grant Spell Power (more on this below). Intellect will also provide less mana than it currently does.<br />
<br />
Haste - Haste will become more attractive for melee classes by allowing them to recover resources such as energy and runes more quickly. Our intention is for Haste to let you &quot;do stuff&quot; more often.<br />
<br />
Block Rating - Block is being redesigned to scale better. Blocked attacks will simply hit for 30% less damage. Block rating will improve your chance to block, though overall block chances will be lower than they are today.<br />
<br />
Parry - Parry no longer provides 100% avoidance and no longer speeds up attacks. Instead, when you parry an attack, it and the next attack will each hit for 50% damage (assuming they hit at all). In other words, Dodge is a chance to avoid 100% of the damage from one attack, Parry is a chance to avoid 50% of the damage from two attacks, and Block is a chance to avoid 30% of the damage from one attack.<br />
<br />
Mastery - This is a new stat that will allow players to become better at whatever makes their chosen talent tree cool or unique. It's directly tied to talents, so what you gain from improving this stat is entirely dependent upon your class and the talent specialization you choose. We’ll talk more about specific Mastery benefits in the future.<br />
<br />
Armor - The way Armor mitigates damage is not changing, but the Armor stat has been rebalanced to mirror changes to the armor curve in Cataclysm. As a result, bonus Armor will go down slightly overall. We are also changing the mitigation difference among armor types so that plate doesn’t offer so much more protection than mail, leather, and cloth.<br />
<br />
Resilience - This will only affect damage done by players and critical damage done by players. It will not impact crit chance, mana drains, or other such effects.<br />
<br />
Strength, Agility, Hit Rating, Expertise, and Critical Strike Rating - These will all still appear on gear as well. Aside from situations mentioned elsewhere in this list, in general these will function similarly to how they do now, though the details -- such as how much Hit Rating you might need to effectively combat high-level creatures (more on this below) -- are likely to change.<br />
<br />
<br />
Being Removed from Items<br />
<br />
Attack Power - This stat will no longer be present on most items as a flat value, though it will still show up on some process. Strength and Agility, which will be present on items, will grant the appropriate amount of Attack Power (generally 2 Attack Power per point of Strength or Agility) depending upon which stat a particular class favors. Agility may provide less Crit than it currently does.<br />
<br />
Spell Power - Spell Power is another stat that you'll no longer see present on most items. Instead, as mentioned above, Intellect will grant Spell Power. One exception is that caster weapons will still have Spell Power. This allows us to make weapons proportionately more powerful for casters in the same way they are for melee classes.<br />
<br />
Armor Penetration - This stat will no longer be present on items. Armor Penetration will still exist in talents and abilities.<br />
<br />
Shield Block Value - This stat will no longer be present on items, since the amount blocked is always proportional to the amount of damage done. Talents and other effects might still modify the damage-reduction percentage from 30%, however.<br />
<br />
<br />
Going Away Completely<br />
<br />
MP5 - This stat will be removed from the game completely. Holy paladins and Restoration shaman will be redesigned to benefit from Spirit.<br />
<br />
Defense - Defense is being removed from the game entirely. Tanking classes should expect to become uncrittable versus creatures just by shifting into Defensive Stance, Frost Presence, Bear Form, or by using Righteous Fury.<br />
<br />
Spell Ranks - Spell ranks will cease to exist. All spells will have one rank and will scale appropriately with level. The levels at which you can learn certain spells are being changed in order to fill in some of the gaps, and we will be introducing some new spells to learn along the way as well.<br />
<br />
Weapon Skill - This stat will be removed from the game completely. Classes will start with all the weapon skills they need to know and will not need to improve them.<br />
<br />
<br />
What Else You Should Know<br />
<br />
Combat ratings - All ratings will be much harder to &quot;cap out&quot; at maximum gear levels. Ratings will be steeper in Cataclysm, and creatures in later tiers of content will be harder to hit or crit, similar to how level-83 mobs are harder to hit or crit than level-80 mobs.<br />
<br />
Reforging - While these changes will go a long way to making a wider variety of stats more attractive, we understand that sometimes you simply don’t want more Hit Rating on your gear or you’d rather have more Haste than more Crit. In Cataclysm, we are going to give players a way to replace stats on gear as part of the existing profession system. As a general rule of thumb, you’ll be able to convert one stat to 50% of another stat. While some conversions (like converting Stamina to Strength) won’t be permitted, the goal is to let you customize your gear more.<br />
<br />
Gems - We are changing the gem colors of a few stats as a result of these adjustments. For example, Hit is likely to be blue instead of yellow. We'll have more details on this in the future. <br />
<br />
Changes to Existing Gear<br />
<br />
As with previous expansions, we plan to roll out these changes and modify all existing gear shortly before Cataclysm launches, though it’s still too early to say exactly when. For the most part, the gear you have will still be good for you, though there will be exceptions, such as warriors using leather and mail armor.<br />
<br />
If you are a tank (druids excepted), expect to see:<br />
No more Defense on gear. Existing Defense becomes Dodge, Parry, or Block Rating.<br />
No more Block Value on gear. Existing Block Value becomes Block Rating.<br />
You’ll have as much Stamina as you’re used to, though you may notice your tanking plate has a bit less Stamina than a comparable piece of DPS plate, since we tend to take the gem budget out of your most attractive stat.<br />
Bonus Armor on gear will go down slightly.<br />
<br />
If you are a melee DPS class, druid tank, or hunter, expect to see:<br />
A lot more Stamina. Bear-form Stamina scaling will be lowered as a result.<br />
Strength if you wear plate. Agility if you wear mail or leather.<br />
Existing Attack Power becomes Agility and Stamina.Armor Penetration becomes Haste or Crit.<br />
No Intellect on melee gear. Hunters won’t need Intellect since they will no longer use mana. Shaman and Retribution paladins will get mana and spell damage in other ways.<br />
<br />
If you are a DPS caster, expect to see:<br />
A lot more Stamina.<br />
All of your Spell Power converted to Intellect and Stamina.<br />
No Spirit. You won’t miss Spirit, though, because you won’t need it for DPS or mana regen.<br />
<br />
If you are a healer, expect to see:<br />
A lot more Stamina.<br />
All of your Spell Power converted to Intellect and Stamina.<br />
Spirit instead of MP5. You’ll probably be happy with Spirit, though, because mana regen is going to matter more than it does currently. Healing paladins and shaman will benefit more from Spirit than they do currently.<br />
<br />
If you are a Balance druid or Elemental shaman:<br />
You will still share gear with Restoration druids and shaman.<br />
Your gear will have Spirit on it. It won’t have Hit on it.<br />
You will have a talent that converts Spirit to Hit. We will adjust talents accordingly so that you want about as much Spirit as, say, a warlock wants Hit.<br />
Hit on rings and other such gear will still benefit you.<br />
Raid buffs will no longer boost Spirit, so you shouldn’t find yourself unexpectedly over the Hit cap because of buffs.<br />
<br />
Many lower-level items with nonsensical combinations of stats, such as Agility and Spirit, will be changed. We're also updating quest rewards, trade skills, and loot drops to support better itemization for class builds that weren't widely available or used prior to The Burning Crusade (such as Balance druids).<br />
<br />
We're aware this is a lot of information to take in, but this is still only a piece of the larger picture, and many of these changes rely on integration with other systems we haven't yet discussed in detail. In the weeks and months ahead, we'll continue to tell you more about these changes, along with all of the new and exciting features we have planned for Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

Well, quoting for you(maybe you will read it this time ::))<br />

Yeah I was a little low on hit and was using yellow hit gems /palmface I learned my lesson but this would be a cool change.<br />

Did you consider there was a reason Blizzard made two categories in the post and called them &quot;dps caster&quot; and &quot;Balance druid/elemental shaman&quot;? If you are a shadowpriest, you are not a balance druid. If you are a shadowpriest, you are not an elemental shaman. Conclusion: You are in the DPS CASTER group.<br />

No offense, but I don't really appreciate being called a moron for an honest question. The reason why I asked in the first place is because pallies don't really use MP5 now (or at least in a limited amount). Maybe I've been informed wrong (or read the talents wrong) but most of the pally's regen is from crits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They will probably tune it so that a different stat will be the basis of the Life Tap Glyph more likely then not Intellect as they plan on the PTR to make the Life Tap spell itself increase with spell power instead of spirit to receive more of a health loss and mana gain.</div></div><hr />

Assuming that is what our mastery goes towards.<br />
<br />
Besides, they aren't changing the current ArP to mastery, they will be swapping in haste or crit, which would cause DPS to fall drastically with the talents aren't changed to compensate.</div></div><hr />

Since Paladins are not Balance Druids or Elemental Shaman, spirit will not be converted to Hit.<br />
<br />
Holy Paladins will use Spirit for mana regen, and Ret Paladins will not use Spirit at all.</div></div><hr />

My guess is no and will share gear with Mages &amp; Warlocks.<br />
<br />
<br />
The more I think about it, though (I know, it's been ~5 minutes, and that isn't a lot of time to think about it more), the more I think Priests in general are going to want to stack spirit whether they're Disc/Holy/Shadow. Look at what caster gear for each type of armor is going to have:<br />
<br />
Cloth: Non-Spirit (2 classes/roles -- Mage and Warlock), and Spirit (2 classes/roles -- Holy and Disc Priest)<br />
Leather: Spirit (2 classes/roles -- Tree and Boomkin)<br />
Mail: Spirit (2 classes/roles -- Resto Shaman and Elemental Shaman)<br />
Plate: Spirit (1 class/role -- Holy Paladin)<br />
<br />
I have a feeling that Disc Priests will be dipping in to the Non-Spirit (and non-hit) pieces though since Disc has relied more heavily on Intellect than Spirit, and the only reason to stack any spirit now is for regen purposes. If they do end up pulling from both, then you would have something more like this for the Cloth use line:<br />
<br />
Cloth: Non-Spirit (2.5 classes/roles -- Mage, Warlock, and 1/2 Disc Priest), and Spirit (1.5 classes/roles -- Holy and 1/2 Disc Priest)<br />
<br />
If the devs want to balance out how many roles are using gear, then shadow would fit in well with the Cloth-Spirit category. Additionally, when looking at itemizing drops off of bosses presently versus in Cataclysm, there are a lot of overlapping pieces between Cloth DPS and Healers, but that will be changing since the Cloth DPS gear is not going to be sought after by healers anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you consider there was a reason Blizzard made two categories in the post and called them &quot;dps caster&quot; and &quot;Balance druid/elemental shaman&quot;? If you are a shadowpriest, you are not a balance druid. If you are a shadowpriest, you are not an elemental shaman. Conclusion: You are in the DPS CASTER group.<br />
<br />
<br />
See the top part of this post. It doesn't make sense to have non-spirit and spirit items for Leather and Mail because the usability would be very, very limited. The only reason it is like that for Paladins is because Paladins don't have a caster DPS spec.</div></div><hr />

There will still be a difference between armor types, it just won't be as drastic. This goes hand in hand with the elimination of armor pen stat, to allow physical DPS a fair chance to damage plate wearers.</div></div><hr />

They've simultaneously give us a ton of information to chew on and told us virtually nothing. They've laid out all the details of how every stat will affect every class and how they plan to overcome many of the difficulties inherent in such a major change; but without actually seeing how a piece of gear gets re-itemized or seeing how that re-itemization actually affects DPS, Healing, or TPS/Avoidance we still can't theory craft or make any educated guesses about what it all means. I suspect gear choices will remain far more complicated than people think. If they are particularly successful, there may even be instances where a character can pick the stat to stack. It would be interesting if I could chose to be a &quot;haste&quot; rogue or a &quot;crit&quot; rogue, with similar max DPS potentials, but significant impact on how I chose upgrade pieces.</div></div><hr />

They have yet to comment if INT will have a regen component at all. Reading this post, combined with info from Blizzcon, I am leaning towards INT no longer providing regen, and %mana restoration effects changed to work off Spirit.<br />

Also, INT will have a lesser effect on mana pool. All in all, healers will need SPI to survive. The question is: What will the playstyle be like?

You don't have to wait, because this question has been answered Ad Nauseum by blues over the past few months. The intention is that healing will be less focused on spamming heals and more focused on using the correct heal for the situation.

Sweet, I'll get to tank in dps gear! Healers don't care about running oom and I'll bet *anyone* that they won't care about running oom after the rating conversions.<br />
<br />
Hence, we'll be tanking the everything in WotLK in 4.0 in dps gear.<br />
<br />
Awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you just skip the healer section..<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are a healer, expect to see:<br />
<br />
* A lot more Stamina.<br />
* All of your Spell Power converted to Intellect and Stamina.<br />
* Spirit instead of MP5. You’ll probably be happy with Spirit, though, because mana regen is going to matter more than it does currently. Healing paladins and shaman will benefit more from Spirit than they do currently.<br />
<br />
We don't know how the SP will convert into Stam/Int yet nor do we know the Spirit convertion, but bets are you willregen more but heal less, as you've seem to have missed the blue post on 'healer coordination' or lack of, Blizzard intends on making healing 'fun', by 'fun' they probly mean less spamming of keys and more thought, like I said that stat changes don't make the game easier, they make it harder for the 'half-arsed'</div></div><hr />

You'll be able to convert half of it. You'll also be able to convert half the Strength or Agility on a piece into INT. That doesn't mean it will be good caster gear.</div></div><hr />

Current system is just plain retarded. Right now the difference in health between melee dps warrior and melee dps shaman can be nearly 10k with same gearscore.

The intention is that healing will be less focused on spamming heals and more focused on using the correct heal for the situation. Mana regeneration will matter a lot more because (ideally) healers will never reach an infinite mana state.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, I've read these posts as well. However, since I cannot be inside the head of a &quot;blue&quot; to understand what they mean by &quot;less spammy,&quot; I really cannot speculate to what it will be like until I can experience it. <br />
<br />
Let me put it this way: Do you really think a healer is going to cast a heal, sit around for 2 or 3 GCDs, then cast another heal in a 25man raid setting? I just can't see this. I think mainly they are going to get away from damage auras, which funny enough has become their go-to mechanic the challenge healers in WotLK. One can use the correct heal for the situation and still be casting every GCD. If I'm casting every GCD, I'm spamming. If my regen is nerfed, encounters become DPS&gt;Healer Mana Pool. Simple as that.<br />
<br />
So, there are just too many variables and subjectivity to really comment on how different the play-style will be.</div></div><hr />

The post I was quoting, spoke nothing of paladins, just which category shadowpriests would fall into, of the two mentioned in the blue post: DPS Caster or BOOMKIN/ELESHAMMY. My reply was given with that in mind - shadowpriests are not boomkin or ele shammy, making them caster dps. Got nothing to do with Paladins. At all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Big part of shadow priests damage comes from Spirit. To take it away and from our gear &quot;Caster DPS&quot; will hurt. I can only assume Blizzard knows this.<br />
<br />
<br />
They are aware of it. Check out our Tier10 pieces. Not a single point of Spirit. We're being reworked in Cataclysm, just like the rest of the classes. Spirit will most likely mean less to us then than it does now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I understand it correctly, stamina is being leveled out, so tanks will be jemming more stam to compensate, as well as jemming more defensive stats, i.e. block, parry, dodge. Armor is being leveled out, because of said dodge, parry and block, since casters won't be gemming for it, and thus will need some form of damage mitigation increase from armor. Remember that casters will still be soloing pve content at some point, and should not have to worry about getting one shot by world mobs.</div></div><hr />

They're not hard because everyone uses a simulator, spreadsheet, etc.<br />
<br />
Are you seriously saying that every single class has spreadsheets and/or simulators, programs like RAWR exist and loot ranking websites like LootRank and MaxDPS exist - yet nobody actually needs to use them at all? You're being silly if you think that 99% people can look at an item that has small differences in (for example) expertise vs. crit/ap and automatically know which provides the highest dps bonus if they haven't simulated/spreadsheeted/researched their current gear stats apriori.</div></div><hr />

idk about you guys but i kinda liked how every class was different, sure warriors have more hp than most melee dps, I have also always seen warriors as the big fcker thats in your face and his hp is follwed. I dont see why people are actually that butt hurt that that pure dps class has more hp than you. makes no sense, and i dont play a warrior btw.<br />

Health pools will be much closer between plate-wearers and other classes.<br />
<br />
Oh yea, those 35k disc priests really need more health.<br />
<br />
<br />
Armor - The way Armor mitigates damage is not changing, but the Armor stat has been rebalanced to mirror changes to the armor curve in Cataclysm. As a result, bonus Armor will go down slightly overall. We are also changing the mitigation difference among armor types so that plate doesn’t offer so much more protection than mail, leather, and cloth.<br />
<br />
So basicly they're nerfing plate and buffing everyone else... again.</div></div><hr />

Also the increased stam and armor for all classes is very welcome to me, it seems to be part of a larger shift toward making fights less spiky. Hopefully now clothies in my raid won't be getting one shot by random flying damage. However this also seems to indicate a greater importance to EH in tanking, kind of like we've seen in ICC. The flat 30% damage decrease from blocks will make paladins godly in the EH department, as they are now... I'm very glad I play one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crafters can reforge items to change the stats. I get that. <br />
What I do not know is if reforging can only be done to gears you created yourself.<br />
Or it can be done to any gears you aquired (from drops, rewards etc.)<br />
And also, can it be done in the same fashion Enchanting works, A person can open trade a reforger to get his gear changed?<br />
<br />
Why does this matter you might ask? If the answer to the first question is yes, then rerolling a crafting profession will be quite ideal. If not, then Reforging won't be that big of a deal since other people can do it for you.</div></div><hr />

And lets face it - once you have equiped the gear it's not like it will change your play style.

<br />
Let me put it this way: Do you really think a healer is going to cast a heal, sit around for 2 or 3 GCDs, then cast another heal in a 25man raid setting? <br />

If healing more often is going to cause overheal and OOM, then yes, I can see that for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the removal of stats and literally smushing everything together it just seems abit dumb. The only thing left in wrath was making gear choices now its prety much set out for you...<br />
<br />
sure there will be stat changing and crap but honestly half this stuff seems really dumb. <br />
<br />
<br />
I didn't think it was possible to be quite this wrong.<br />
<br />
As it is now; there's only a VERY limited amount of gear any class really wants, because the weighting for the multitude of stats is so skewed in favour of a very small number of them for each class; and each class has a different skew, so the huge number of items being made are being made very narrowly to fit to all the different roles.<br />
<br />
With a drastic reduction in the number of stats which appear on items, it allows for a drastic increase of the usability of different items for classes; depending on what you want to emphasize.<br />
<br />
Doubly so with reforging.<br />
<br />
Means Blizzard can not only create less pieces of gear, and therefore make each piece more interesting, but even with the lessened number of pieces, there'll be greater options for what any given class will want to use.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they want to simplify everything entirely, instead they're trying to reduce the number of stats and modifiers that you have to be familiar with in order to know how to maximize your class. Right now guilds practically have to give new raid members math lessons in how to figure out how to maximize their characters, and personally I'm kind of sick of explaining this stuff. By giving say, casters just two major stats to worry about (int and hit) then hopefully people will have an easier time figuring it out for themselves.</div></div><hr />

You&#8217;ll have as much Stamina as you&#8217;re used to, though you may notice your tanking plate has a bit less Stamina than a comparable piece of DPS plate, since we tend to take the gem budget out of your most attractive stat.<br />

So the few of us that sometimes gemed in the right colors will be forced even more to stack stam??? oO<br />
<br />
On the whole i read: <br />
Tanks = less or same stam, less avoidance, mitigation gets nerved?<br />
DDs &amp; Heal = !Much more stam! + dmg<br />
<br />
while i know that blizz will balance the encounters around this, I fear this will get very very annoying as there are even now some DKs in full pvp gear that say things like: &quot;let me tank, i have as much HP as the tank.&quot; while barely doing 1k dmg....<br />

Actually there will always be a hit cap, however it will increase as we progress (ie to use a WotLK example, hit cap in Naxx would be lower than hit cap in ICC) again this appears to add more complexities.<br />

<br />
Essentially they've turned Parry into a Block of it's own, which makes it quite attractive actually in my opinion...<br />
<br />
I'm actually considering going back to tanking after these changes land, simply for the fact they seem to be exactly what the game needs. It's not simplification, it's actually brilliant.<br />
<br />
Intellect giving Spellpower will be like Strength and Agility giving Attack Power - this should make balancing items out somewhat easier. Later bosses needing more Crit and Hit to do more damage - I like it. Makes content scaling better and progression raiding more meaningful again.<br />
<br />
Jewelcrafting - I think they should just remove all the colours from the gem slots for bonuses and just make the bonuses a straight-forward increase for their intended role. It IS a bit simplified, but if you let players pick whatever combination of gems they want, you'd get more profits from selling gems as people would regem as they get gear they want.<br />
<br />
All in all - I really like the sound of all this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that's the case, you're going to have some extremely bored healers who will be wasting some pretty nifty twitch skills developed over the past years.<br />
<br />
I mean, it will separate to some extent the Shield Spammer/Rejuv/Renew blanketer from those who remember OOMing... I just don't think people understand how much this will really affect the game. If I'm playing my healer very well, and my fight rhythm is HEAL [three GCD] HEAL, that means DPS have very little incoming damage. Why, then, are we increasing HP? What I read in the past was that it was to provide more of a buffer between 100%-0%, which is another way of saying &quot;give healers more time to react.&quot; I seriously doubt I will be resting 3 GCDs between heals.<br />
<br />
But, for argument's sake, I will be &quot;HEAL [three GCD] HEAL&quot; in 'Clysm. Do I diminish the importance of healers in a raid? Do I take less healers in my raid? Do I increase the importance of tank healing? Do I get to do something useful during those three GCDs?<br />
<br />
I'm sure we will all adjust just fine, but I think this change will have the single greatest impact on PvE play for 'Clysm.</div></div><hr />

Now next time try to think before posting.<br />
<br />
Do you really think that simplifying game even more will help people to became a stronger community?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes , I am sure mister DKmasterarthas with 71 points in Blood and spell power gems will become much better if you add more stats . I was just stating a fact , very few players have skill and those who do stopped playing or are bored . You will never have the raiding of Vanilla and TBC back , that community is gone( mostly).I expect Cataclysm raiding to be even more simple than atm and even more simple . <br />
Anyway saying a game is easier or harder based on how many stats you need to look on is silly . If you wan a solid community again start teaching all these new guys the basics and start all over again . Anyway , work tommorow for me , have fun arguing :)</div></div><hr />

Existing Attack Power becomes Agility and Stamina.Armor Penetration becomes Haste or Crit.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, great and all. What about us PvP players who have PvP 2h? Will I just have to replace it asap in cata, since I'll be running around with a 2h sword that gives me no attack power? Or are we going to see something like BC again, where sword and mace will be Str/Stam, and Axe and Polearm will be Agi/Stam? (Well, they weren't Agi/Stam then, but you get the drift)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daxmort</div><div class="date">2010-03-01, 08:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So from what I can tell, there will be two types of leather, two types of mail, two types of cloth, and still three types of plate (DPS, tank and spirit for the mana regen/healing)?<br />
<br />
I mean, there'll be 'caster/healing' leather (boomkin and tree), DPS leather (for cat and rogue), and then caster/healing mail, and 'DPS mail' (for Hunters and Enhance Shammies), and then caster cloth and healing cloth.<br />
<br />
While I'm not saying I'd like to be fighting with a Holy Paladin over my DPS plate, I find it a bit strange that we still have a piece of loot that can sometimes end up being completely useless to a raid (especially for those of us that are of strict 10-man progression that don't have a Holy Paladin on our roster).<br />

<br />
Same for warriors obviously.<br />
<br />
Hence why the stamina buff for dps classes.<br />
<br />
<br />
The intent stated was that a tank class can tank any normal and that they 'possibly' might be able to tank some heroics without having to do to much shuffling. They still want heroics to be done by tank specs though so I highly doubt we will see Ret Paladins tanking heroics until later in the expansion when mudflation kicks in.<br />
<br />
It will be a great change though for leveling up from 15-85 for every tank class.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh , let's not forget that during wow's &quot;hardmode&quot; ( vanilla) we had even fewer stats , that didn't stop them from making Naxxramas and making the game difficult. The game is balanced for &lt;less gifted players&gt; atm , but the community is MUCH weaker ( skill wise ) than it was 5 years ago ( ironically) .<br />
<br />
I know maybe 10 people that remained from vanilla ( hardcores aka people that saw more than the first trash pack in Naxx before TBC) and the rest are people that started in TBC or dk Heroes. This game , if you talking about hardcore is dead , but I am happy about this tbh . I don't have as much time as I used to have and the game , even if it's much too easy for my taste , is perfect for the limited time I have.<br />
<br />
<br />
Naa your just ignorant. Has nothing at all to do with &quot;weapon skill&quot;. The game as of right now is &quot;vast&quot; as in alot of shit to experience. So lets say to fully explore and explain wow as it is today, it would take a whole novel yes? or so it would seem to someone half new. After this it will be a picture book 3 pages long. <br />
<br />
I liked how wow covered so many areas of ideas. Ah, trainers, factions, currency, economy... stuff like that. It makes no sense to cut this stuff down when it was already not only simple but only added to a gaming experience. Like i said afew posts ago, i feel bad for anyone that starts playing when this goes. leveling up late that night because i get a new rank of a bad ass spell was incentive. Now im going to enjoy leveling because why?</div></div><hr />

This seems like a bad deal? anyone else feel this way? I mean its semi useful as in say me(warlock) rolling on healer gear and getting rid of the spirit for int and still maybe be a useful piece. But other than that this seems bad. anyone else agree?</div></div><hr />

Listen people, if you currently have a spell or talent that obviously cannot work with the suggested itemization chances are they have freaking noticed and will be changing that spell, either to scale off another stat or to have a completely different functionality (or even removing it alltogether).<br />
<br />
I expected crit suppresion on high tier bosses but I am wondering about hit suppression. I wonder how visible the math will be (technically the math is not visible in the UI at all). It will mean that you'll need additional gear sets when raiding across tiers I guess, but I will not mind the flexible cap as long as it is reasonably obvious. I do consider it a welcome change that people do not need to do personal research to understand arcane topics like the crit cap. <br />
<br />
Very exciting change to tank stats. Parry sounds awesome (and will probably be expensive as hell). I expect there will be a mastery threshold after which block&gt;parry in mitigation for paladins and warriors. Also if armor is no longer so absurdly strong in itemization, maybe they will actually start using bonus armor more liberally on tank gear (since currently bonus armor pretty much means automatic BiS). <br />
<br />
No spirit buffs sounds a bit weird (especially in a world that cares about mana regen heavily). High health pools for all means that either raid healing will become a game of attrition, with constant raid damage that does not directly threaten yet relatively inefficient raid heals that have trouble keeping up anyway; or massive predictable damage that can only be healed with throughput cooldowns (yet even those conditions will not convince the dpsers to click on the ridiculously efficient and strong lightwell GC, so just drop that thing already).<br />
<br />
Btw all the people who say this makes it retardely easy; did you actually research those equivalencies yourself? Did you craft your own spreadsheets? People will still need to crunch numbers to calculate stat weights and there is nothing easy with each tier changing the number game.</div></div><hr />

For those who never remembered number 540 we remove defence.<br />
For those who never remembered where to learn polearms, we remove weapon skills.<br />
For those who never remembered where class trainer is and can't understand what RankWatch whispers to them, we removed spell ranks.<br />
And of course, for those tanks who can't decide should they gem stamina or dodge, we reduce stamina on tank gear so we would all gem stamina.<br />
<br />
Now we finally make this game so ridiculously easy, every imbecile can look smart.<br />
And, see, how many people in these 10 pages are exalted with changes. Probably had hard time remembering 540 defence...<br />
<br />
<br />
This is the dumbest thing I've read all day. These changes were needed because obnoxiously complicated mechanics and algorithms in a VIDEO GAME is retarded. Having to read spreadsheets to determine whether an item is an upgrade or not? Leveling weapon skills, an obnoxious chore, solely to REMOVE a PENALTY? Dealing with wasting time and gold teetering on the 540 cap? How the hell is THAT fun or &quot;knowledgeable&quot;?<br />

And as a priest it's fuckin annoying to time your heals. You spam so much shit the whole bossfight, while using EVERY GCD. What are priests supposed to do? Cast 1 Renew every 3 secs? Sounds kinda boring imho.<br />

<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm wrong, but it sounds more like holy priests will have it worse. Their cloth can now be attractive to every healer as well as elemental shaman and boomkins. Holy priests can't use leather, mail or plate, but there seems to be much less reason now for a shaman or pally to roll for cloth shoulders with spirit, for example, than there will be come Cataclysm. Before we only had to worry about druids sniping our cloth for the spirit, now all healers use spirit... not to mention the 2 dps caster exceptions.<br />

<br />
When i started wow new shit was fun, i feel bad for anyone thats starts wow after this goes into effect. <br />
<br />
<br />
None of the changes he listed were what made this game fun. How has weapon skill ever been anything but a burden? If you play a Warrior and get a sweet new 2-hand axe you haven't yet used since you hit 80 you get to go spend 2 hours killing low level creatures trying to hit them with your giant axe! SWEET!<br />
<br />
Having your spells scale is going to vastly improve the fun factor of the leveling experience and will also likely make players better since they will be learning rotations earlier. Shaman aren't going to be constantly rotating what shock they use based on their level simply because you just trained a new rank making it better than what you should be using. Some classes won't be using archaic spells that only exist in the depths of their spellbooks because they were just on the trainer at that level. Priests have a couple heals that only existed at lower levels and are replaced by the time you hit 80 so only having those spells which actually matter and having them scale with level will make you better understand your abilities.<br />
<br />
Defense cap is really the only thing he listed which was some kind of accomplishment and that takes little effort as is. Druids don't have to worry about it as they get it from spec, Paladins used to get a ton from spec, and DK's get a ton from weapon enchant so it has really only been an accomplishment for warriors most of this game. Hell my DK has been 80 for 3 hours played time and is defense capped with nothing but quest rewards and boe blues.<br />
<br />
These changes are going to make the game less mathy for 80s, which isn't necessarily a good thing, and leveling a better training experience for new players like it should be. But then again that math is done by &lt;1% of the population, 30% read the data and apply it and the other ~70% are oblivious to it so the changes probably are better overall because everyone improves by default and there are fewer complex calculations to worry about.</div></div><hr />

Not all of them! A vanilla/bc raider monkey here and I welcome changes. Can't really pass judgment until I've experienced the changes firsthand (at least I can't). But some people are just negative sallies off the bat, so whatever the changes are, these people will make it seem like it's the worst thing since the dawn of sweet little time.<br />
<br />
If the game does end up being eh for myself due to the any changes, I'd just replace it with other games/things. So far it sounds interesting enough, although would like to know much more about the healing side...exercising my patience skill for now.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but defence is a pretty pointless stat. All it does is provide a barrier for people wanting to move into tanking, once you've got a few half decent pieces it's something you can pretty much forget about as you'll never end up below the cap. If they want to remove it and actually use that item budget to give tanks more avoidance/stam then I fail to see how that isn't a good thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
For those who never remembered where to learn polearms, we remove weapon skills.<br />
<br />
Yeah because having to go find a weapon trainer and then hit a mob numerous times before you could use a weapon type you hadn't used during levelling really made the game so much better and it's removal is a horrible simplification. Oh wait, no it's not, it's just the removal of a pointless time sink.<br />
<br />
<br />
For those who never remembered where class trainer is and can't understand what RankWatch whispers to them, we removed spell ranks.<br />
<br />
Please explain to me how having to go back to a class trainer every 2 levels is a good thing? Why shouldn't the fireball spell I learned at level 4 not become progressively more powerful as I level up? As with removing weapon skills all they are doing by removing the need to visit class trainers every 2 levels is removing a time sink. And anyway you're still going to have to visit class trainers every so often to learn actual new skills/spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
And of course, for those tanks who can't decide should they gem stamina or dodge, we reduce stamina on tank gear so we would all gem stamina.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure where you've managed to make that conclusion. Frankly until they release more details about changes to avoidance caps then I don't see how anyone can claim that a slight reduction on stamina found on gear will mean that everyone will want to gem stamina, altho even if that was the end result I don't see how that's really any different to the current situation.<br />

Rather than throwing out pointless insults how about providing a proper explanation why you think that removing some pointless stats makes the game ridiculously easy? Vanilla WoW had fewer stats than we have now and noone considered that to be easy. At the end of the day people will have just as many stats to juggle on their gear, it's just that they'll be able to understand them without needing a degree in Maths or having to use someone else's theorycrafting spreadsheet.</div></div><hr />

And for those bitching about &quot;ÑEÑE wher did al my ztat spredsheets gone ÑEÑE&quot;, I prefer the game to be a bit difficult and NOT the numbers. Numbers will still maintain importance, but not as muchs as now.<br />

<br />
Paladins, Resto Shamans, Ele Shamans, Moonkins, Resto Druids can now all roll on Spirit Cloth (in raids, not 5 man loot system)<br />
Spirit Cloth is needed by 6 Specs.<br />
Spirit Leather by 5 specs.<br />
Spirit Mail by 3 specs.<br />
Spirit Plate by 1 spec.<br />
This system seems to fail...<br />
<br />
Next is:<br />
Resto Druids and Resto Shamans can easily switch to Moonkin or Elemental, whereas Holy Priests/Paladins are screwed up and can't switch to Shadow/Retribution.<br />
Tell your Restos to dualspec elemental/balance, they can, just need ring,necks and trinkets, and are happy.<br />
Tell your Holy Paladin or Holy priest to respec Retri/Shadow, they can't, need new gear for all of their slots.<br />
<br />
2 Healing classes get screwed.<br />
<br />
1 getting even more screwed with loot, competing with 6 other specs for loot.<br />
<br />
Who the fuck thought up this design? It's utterly crap.<br />
<br />
Let ALL DPS casters go for dps cloth, increase cloth droprate.<br />
Let ALL Healers for go healing cloth, increase cloth droprate.<br />
<br />
That would at least fix 1 of the two problems. But 2 hybrid specs still are screwed</div></div><hr />

Expect a stat reduction if you don't use your class or something.<br />
<br />
<br />
A quite effective way to do that would bee a 10% (or something) reduce in stats on that idem per tier of armor below ur highest one. Ex a pala using cloth would get the stats on that Item reduced by 10% Mail -&gt; 20% Leather - 30% cloth</div></div><hr />

That's not how it is.<br />

Resto and boomkins will share spell leather, ele and resto shamans will share spell mail.<br />

You'll only have to share with one other spec.<br />

If your raid leader is still handing out spell leather to shaman after this well... he's a moron. <br />

Sure plate dps will stick to Str now, but mail will be able to downgrade to leather, sharing identical stats, and healers and hybrid casters will be downgrading to lower armor types with ease. Unless ofc they design a crap ton of talents like bladed armor so that people can value armor (or perhaps if non plate armor is somehow equalized through secondary spells and talents and we get a lot of physical (armor mitigated) raid damage all over the place making armor a good stat for everyone).</div></div><hr />

Cataclysm Stat &amp; System Changes<br />
[blizzquote author=Eyonix source=http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425636414-cataclysm-stat--system-changes.html]<br />
<br />
If you are a Balance druid or Elemental shaman:<br />
You will still share gear with Restoration druids and shaman.<br />
Your gear will have Spirit on it. It won’t have Hit on it.<br />
You will have a talent that converts Spirit to Hit. We will adjust talents accordingly so that you want about as much Spirit as, say, a warlock wants Hit.<br />
Hit on rings and other such gear will still benefit you.<br />
Raid buffs will no longer boost Spirit, so you shouldn’t find yourself unexpectedly over the Hit cap because of buffs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And with one fell swoop, my Shaman wont be my main for another Expac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Druids still need 2 different sets + bit of tanking rings for their tree choices.<br />

<br />

To the rest: expected, dumping down is part of Cata concept. but i doubt all changes will make it. <br />
<br />
I really like this one:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Stat &amp; System Changes<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
[b]Combat ratings - All ratings will be much harder to &quot;cap out&quot; at maximum gear levels. Ratings will be steeper in Cataclysm, and creatures in later tiers of content will be harder to hit or crit, similar to how level-83 mobs are harder to hit or crit than level-80 mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
But i am 100% certain this wont be implented. Raids should have a progression in terms of difficulty and not make one raid super simple, the next next a little harder and the following tiers again simple. Those combat rating changes would help with that, arthas would be harder to hit as Kel Thuzad but with that whole dumping down and content for braindead monkeys that wont work.<br />
<br />
raiding will still be freeloot in normal mode and that wont change, even if blizzard wanted to because generation Wotlk doesnt want to wipe once.</div></div><hr />

(Yes PvE is still hard but see below what's my point)<br />
<br />
Like if you dont get so much statses from higher iLVL items, you cant just overrun 'easier' instances (example; You can overrun Naxx with Ulduar gear or above so easily, but it's still tough with full rares.) I'm really interested to see if this is going to happen. So you have to clear 'easier' instances first b4 u go harder ones. Atm u can just ding 80 and go roflol toc/heroics for 232/245 iLVL gear and poof, you got gear ready for ICC.<br />
<br />
... aaand PvP! I really want to see how these stat changes will effect on PvP! Will matches last longer? I really hope so.</div></div><hr />

My tank has 583 defense with no def gems or def trinkets or whatever and it is ridiculous to have a stat that is on almost every tank piece, and yet it is unnecessary to even look at when considering an upgrade</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">treebus</div><div class="date">2010-03-01, 09:16 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gearing now is NOT interesting. Sure it may be complicated, but people just make spreadsheets. What I hope to see more of in cata is: &quot;Because of my current gear setup, haste is better for me than crit&quot;. Now I get too more pieces, and suddenly &quot;With those upgrades, expertise is now my best stat&quot;. That would be an interesting system. Stack ArPen to cap then stack agi... that's not an interesting system. <br />
<br />
Getting rid of a stat (SP) that scales directly with ilvl is not dumbing things down. Getting rid of AP when every class always wants Str = X AP = Y Agi at all levels of gearing is not dumbing things down.<br />
<br />
It may be that the game is simpler in Cata, it may be that it's more complicated. The information in this blue post isn't enough to say either, but I'm inclined to believe it will be more towards more interesting at the very least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, if you want to theorycraft and &quot;napkin math,&quot; go take a math class. For a large majority, getting a piece of gear that gives 5 agility, 24 AP, .33% crit while taking away .75% haste and determining if it's an upgrade XYZ spec, but maybe good for offspec ABC spec is NOT fun.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kryptiki</div><div class="date">2010-03-01, 09:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This game does, in fact, get easier every day I play it. The more I learn the more I am able to do. I think that claiming that game is easier out of hand, by not qualifying against player skill and knowledge, is silly. That being said, I'm excited by about 90% of the changes that may be coming down the pipeline. I like that the major stats will be meaningful across the board, but I did like ArP and I even understood how it functioned. Anyway, on to the things that give me pause:<br />
<br />
-Armor Mitigation Balancing: Personally, like one of the above posters, I would much rather wear plate than cloth when having an axe swung at me. I do strongly feel that the damage mitigation provided by heavier armor should remain as is. Cloth/Leather/Mail wearers have, generally, plenty of ways to inflate their damage reduction and the stamina buff should more than even the playing field.<br />
<br />
-Haste: I'm curious how unbalancing haste will be for rogues in PvP. They already have a 1second gcd and a few ways to get their Energy back up, so now they'll recover even faster. That's fucking great. Hunters I could see needing this, badly, with their new resource, and I'm on the fence how powerful, or not, this will make DKs.<br />
<br />
-Stamina Balancing on tanks: Maybe I'm naive, but I don't feel that dropping reducing (relatively) the current levels of mitigation, avoidance, and health is a positive thing. I understand that there will be talents, gear scaling, and what not to prop up a tank, but tanking in cataclysm just seems scarier than it is currently. I, also, liked defense skill, but that's because after gaining an average iLvL of 213 or higher I never had to think of it again.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I'm very interested, with a positive outlook, in the upcoming expansion. I'm sure we'll have many factions for whom we must rep grind, all sorts of fun quests, and there will be more than plenty to keep us busy, for a while.</div></div><hr />

Well cloth armor can be infused with magic, which turns every weapon swung at you into... cotton candy! Cloth armor &gt; Plate armor &gt; Axe.</div></div><hr />

Has nothing at all to do with &quot;weapon skill&quot;. The game as of right now is &quot;vast&quot; as in alot of shit to experience. So lets say to fully explore and explain wow as it is today, it would take a whole novel yes? or so it would seem to someone half new. After this it will be a picture book 3 pages long. <br />
<br />
I liked how wow covered so many areas of ideas. Ah, trainers, factions, currency, economy... stuff like that. It makes no sense to cut this stuff down when it was already not only simple but only added to a gaming experience. Like i said afew posts ago, i feel bad for anyone that starts playing when this goes. leveling up late that night because i get a new rank of a bad ass spell was incentive. Now im going to enjoy leveling because why? <br />
<br />
<br />
Implying leveling is enjoyable.<br />
<br />
Reading forums is like watching Jerry Springer isn't it? YOU IGNORANT #$%^!<br />
<br />
But seriously, I rather like the changes. The part about adding new spells along the way to make up for not having to go back to train sounds titillating. Spirit change is welcome, I missed there being a difference between &quot;healing&quot; and &quot;dps&quot; gear. And the arpen and def changes aren't even that bad. Seems as though certain classes have way too many &quot;caps&quot; to juggle around, and until they hit all of them, they really aren't that effective. Ap and Sp changes remind me of wc3, all I have to say about that.<br />
<br />
Overall, I'm cool with cata. Moreso the fact that we get new skills/spells/talents, rather than the changes to gear...which are big in their own right, but really...who cares? Easier itemization is easier. (and with that new tradeskill, no more dkpbombing on a sidegrade because there's 50 other pieces that are almost completely identical with 1 or 2 better stat differences)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is my point, exactly. Cloth armor, in and of itself, does not need to have a substantial amount of physical damage mitigation. All things being equal, with nothing but physical armor to protect a body, plate should be about three to four times as effective (well, that's my opinion anyway).</div></div><hr />

For those who never remembered number 540 we remove defence.<br />
For those who never remembered where to learn polearms, we remove weapon skills.<br />
For those who never remembered where class trainer is and can't understand what RankWatch whispers to them, we removed spell ranks.<br />
And of course, for those tanks who can't decide should they gem stamina or dodge, we reduce stamina on tank gear so we would all gem stamina.<br />
<br />
Now we finally make this game so ridiculously easy, every imbecile can look smart.<br />

For those who are starting the game as a tank, can level as a tank/don't have to worry about a stat we remove defense and tack it onto stances<br />
For those who don't feel like spending 1g and 2 hours leveling a weapon skill, we removed weapon skills<br />
Those who don't want to leave their training spot/farming spot/questing spot or spend gold on spell ranks, we removed that, butcha still have to go learn the spells initially.<br />
And those tanks who don't know what to stack in gems, stack stam, and reforge for parry, block, or dodge, depending on your taste.<br />

Now the game doesn't require you to do a google of &quot;What's the best gem to stack as a &quot;insert class/spec here&quot;&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the other inane assumptions people are whining about others have addressed, so I'll let those go. I have to say, however, it seems like many of the people posting this nonsense assume that the Blizz dev staff are morons who don't know what they're doing. Might I recommend keeping in mind that these same people built the game you've loved so far, that they know the bigger plans and picture, and that perhaps... just perhaps... they know something about what works when it comes to game design?<br />
<br />
Oh, and for those that haven't noticed, you gain roughly 1 or 2 new rank 1 spells every other level, so you're not losing your reason for training.

<br />
Will the game become more easy or difficult? Only time will tell, as stats are not the only thing that will determine the game difficulty. According to me, it will stay the same, with some theory crafting made easier with the removal of most ridiculous stats in game like arp. But we don't know how complicated mastery will end up as it will be used by every class.<br />
<br />
Also people who are thinking everyone will have the same hp pool should read the post again. They want hp pools to be closer rather plate wearers running with 30%-35% more hp then others. Most probably every class will have 5%-15% hp difference, which is needed. <br />
<br />
One thing that bugs me is the change to how tanks will become crit immune by stance/presence/aura/bear change. This will mean if a tank dies in a raid, any of the plate dps or druid will change form and tank stuff? I did not understand this change personally, would like anyone who understand it better to explain please :)</div></div><hr />

Seriously i spend more time looking over spreadsheets than playing the game with the way things currently stand (possibly due to being able to look at spreadsheets at work instead of playing wow ... but my point still stands :P)<br />
<br />
As a tank, these changes are awesome ... at least in my opinion, im sure there are more ppl screaming &quot;OMGWTFBLIZZ NO CHANGEZ WAHHH!!!111oneeleven!&quot; ... <br />
<br />
Death to spreadsheets!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaedalmael</div><div class="date">2010-03-01, 09:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That is my point, exactly. Cloth armor, in and of itself, does not need to have a substantial amount of physical damage mitigation. All things being equal, with nothing but physical armor to protect a body, plate should be about three to four times as effective (well, that's my opinion anyway).<br />
<br />
I know what you mean. I think it might be a bit harder for a melee to kill a caster with this that it can already be, since not only can most casters manage to get away from a melee with movement spells(blink, demonic teleport, etc) and snares(frost nova), once a melee gets to the caster, their physical damage is going to be reduced by cloth armor also(And then you gotta consider caster shield spells, too)? Doesn't seem to be quite right to me. So far though, that's probably the only stat issue I have with the changes. Also, plate melee vs leather/mail melee... I thought their higher amounts of dodge from agility were what their mitigation was against plate?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot to throw in, this is only considering that the shrunken difference between armor types isn't going to be as significant as I'm reading into it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I disagree. This will allow healers/dps hybrids to become more versatile like they should've been. No more, <br />
&quot;we need another dps/healers. Can you do that?&quot; <br />
&quot;lol no I need more dps/healer gear.&quot;<br />
<br />
And, for the record, my main used to be a resto druid. It was the biggest bitch to get a boomkin set. I would have to wait for 24 other people to get geared before I could have a shot. I cleared the raid content... why can't I have fun in different specs?<br />
<br />
Anyhow, my question is why Shadow Priests aren't included in this spirit-hit conversion.</div></div><hr />

So you're saying you prefer having to do more work? Or you're just bitter that new people will have it easier? Either way your anger sustains me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Under the new system, all stats will be useful the more you have - just like crit is now. However, tanks must be un-crit'able and the only way to do that was to hit 535/540 in defense. So instead of saying, &quot;you must get defense to 540 and then take stats you like,&quot; you can now say, &quot;take what stats you like.&quot; This just makes it a lot easier to guarantee you're at the right defense score at any level without having to calculate it and constantly balance the stat at each level. In short, it just makes gearing tanks (especially at levels 1 - 80) less annoying.</div></div><hr />

I agree! weapon skill leveling was unique, intuitive, interesting, made perfect sense, totally not boring and just down right fun!<br />
<br />
It's not about it being hard. I don't know about you but i play games for fun and weapon skill leveling is not fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the removal of stats and literally smushing everything together it just seems abit dumb. The only thing left in wrath was making gear choices now its prety much set out for you...<br />
<br />
sure there will be stat changing and crap but honestly half this stuff seems really dumb. <br />
<br />
<br />
What choices? Most use spreadsheets and similar things to decide gear. Don't try to act like you actually do any of the thinking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good to see this game can still be dumbed down. Dont think me or any of my friends will be renewing. Bring out SC2 already!<br />
<br />
<br />
You're stupid. Good riddance.<br />

<br />
For those who never remembered number 540 we remove defence.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, because keeping your defense above 540 was very hard.<br />
<br />
The only thing defense does is make tanks a lot more tedious to gear up at lower levels of gear.<br />
<br />

Stop embarassing yourself. Weapon skill didn't make sense. Just going out to hit mobs for 2 hours (or more, that's what it takes for 1-400, the last points take a long time).<br />
It wasn't interesting gameplay, it was stupid gameplay.</div></div><hr />

I didn't even think of the agility issue. Although, the dodge gained from agility, per point, will be reduced, so that should come out to about even. I really only take issue with this stat change from a philosophical/theoretical point of view, I'm sure that my plate wearers will hit like a dump truck full of rhinoceri going downhill. Hopefully.</div></div><hr />

No more tank getting 1 shot on hard modes because he didn't think only having 537 defense would come back to haunt him.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">treebus</div><div class="date">2010-03-01, 09:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing that bugs me is the change to how tanks will become crit immune by stance/presence/aura/bear change. This will mean if a tank dies in a raid, any of the plate dps or druid will change form and tank stuff? I did not understand this change personally, would like anyone who understand it better to explain please :)<br />
<br />
<br />
This also concerns me... hopefully bosses will hit hard enough that the lack of avoidance/(not as gimped but still slightly)gimped health pool is unhealable pretty quickly. Keep in mind though, that currently bosses only crit 5.6% of the time anyway. A dps would on average take 18 hits before getting crit... depending on the boss this can be as long as 43 seconds. In your experience, how many times have you survived a boss for 43 seconds with tanks dead and a dps holding aggro?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because they'll share gear with mages and warlocks? The reason balance and elemental have this conversion is because there will only be healing leather and healing mail, so to make it DPS gear the healing stat which is useless for them (spirit) will become a dps stat. Shadow priests won't need spirit gear.</div></div><hr />

That said, I find many of the complaints in this thread to be ridiculous. Complaining that they are streamlining and simplifying the design? By all means, Blizzard, you should be trying to make things more complex and esoteric. If making WoW more accessible somehow damages your self-importance and sense of elitism, maybe you should rely on something other than a game to build your ego.<br />
<br />
P.S. Removal of weapon skill is awesome!</div></div><hr />

For those who never remembered number 540 we remove defence.<br />
For those who never remembered where to learn polearms, we remove weapon skills.<br />
For those who never remembered where class trainer is and can't understand what RankWatch whispers to them, we removed spell ranks.<br />
And of course, for those tanks who can't decide should they gem stamina or dodge, we reduce stamina on tank gear so we would all gem stamina.<br />
<br />
Now we finally make this game so ridiculously easy, every imbecile can look smart.<br />
And, see, how many people in these 10 pages are exalted with changes. Probably had hard time remembering 540 defence...<br />
<br />
<br />
For those who enjoyt a cap that removed 99% of the possible tanks, and made the queue time as DPS for any HC 20 mins.<br />
For those who enjoyt killing mobs in the VH because you needed to train a freaking pole arm skill. (lucky for my 3 year old brother enjoyt the clicking..about needing brains)<br />
For those who enjoyt returning every lvl to a class trainer and spent your money for a freaking training.<br />
And of course, for those tanks who all gem stam in WoLK, you can still gem stam..who cares, your tank<br />
<br />
Now we finally give the game sense, by making gear use able for more then one class..o no wait specc.<br />
And, see, how many people in these 10 pages are add war with changes. Probably had hard time remembering 540 defence... ;)</div></div><hr />

You're completely right. I know I just LOVED it when I got my fancy new axe and realized I hadn't ever trained axe skill (cause rogues just got he ability a few patches ago), and I got to go train it. Took about thirty seconds. Then I spent the next 3 hours killing the same #$%^#&amp;$# 5 or 6 skeletons in the Crystal Song Forest 12727846278468326745382678 times until my skill finally hit 450. God, that was fun. Especially since I turned off all my buffs and only used auto-attack. Otherwise it would die faster and not give as many chances for points. I suppose I could have wandered around killing other stuff for the sake of variety, but that would have take even LONGER. Yeah, we should totally keep weapon skill so everyone can experience the thrill of killing mass numbers of trivial creatures for hours on end, watching a number slowly creep up to 450.</div></div><hr />

I would think so, blizz has been going on about how healing will be less effective with regards to the bigger health pools, as such that it will take more than just a quick spam to get someone topped off. If this is the case then someone who's defense capped, yet still taking 50% more damage than a nontank, won't last very long</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've had this discussion with our MT before, and we decided to let him run a few points under cap. In the particular example we determined that over the course of the fight (I think this was Hodir), he had a 96% chance of being crit zero times. If we happened to end up in that 4% and wipe, well crappy luck, oh well. (I think this was to eek out some more damage/threat to beat the HM timer, but it was a long time ago, I don't remember details)<br />
<br />
Now, on limitted attempts I'd never say that was OK :)</div></div><hr />
