<br />
Increasing Island Expedition Rewards<br />
Island Expedition bonus rewards (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/7852-Island-Expeditions-Guide-Battle-for-Azeroth) will be increased in a hotfix.<br />
Thank you all for your feedback on Island Expeditions. We’ve been monitoring the rate of rewards from Islands so far, and while we believe we hit the mark with the Azerite rewards, we’re not happy with the drop rates for the various bonus rewards (such as transmog items, pets, quest starters, etc.)<br />
<br />
We’re currently working on a hotfix that will substantially increase the rate of these rewards. Once it’s live, you should start to see more of these items dropping for you (and your group members) on future Island Expeditions. While we don’t have a firm timeframe for this hotfix, we’re hoping to push it out later today.<br />
<br />
Again, thank you for your constructive feedback, and we look forward to seeing you on more Island Expeditions!<br />

Ornyx Leaving Blizzard<br />

That would give people something specific to work towards that they could feel like they are both making constant progress towards while still having them high enough that they are not just going to get lucky get that item then never do it again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Decisive The Hallowed</div><div class="date">2018-09-14, 09:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Didnt they already change Island Expeditions to increase the loot rate like two weeks ago? Could of sworn they did... <br />
(then again, i wouldn't know, gave up doing Island Expeditions within the first two weeks of launch)<br />
What Blizzard need to do is set up a proper vendor that sells that Transmorg gear for the price of the Dubloons that you get in the Expeditions. <br />
Stop this bs of RNG, and add in a reward system that rewards players for putting in the time and effort.</div></div><hr />

I doubt there's a correlation, you don't get a job as a CM if your feefees get hurt easily. He probably just found another job or for all we know announced to his boss he was planning to leave ages before BfA launched.<br />
<br />
Woe be to the poor soul that takes over his position though!</div></div><hr />

Maybe. In fact probably you are right. Still, if you are CM this is the best time to leave.</div></div><hr />

The few times I had any interactions with them they were a hypocrite. They had a history of derailing threads or jumping in just to post and not add to the thread or keep it on track. So from what I saw they were neither cool or helpful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not saying its not entirely possible that the dev team just simply ignored any information the CM relayed but its also equally possible he's just your typical douchebag talking head trying to worm their way up the corporate ladder.<br />
<br />
Why people fondle over people like Ghostcrawler or Ornyx that do nothing but spin words about good communication when the developers aren't doing a fucking thing about anything unless enough people bitch about it? So the solution is to keep bitching instead of telling people to stop &quot;complaining&quot;. Ion just admitted in the Q&amp;A he only cares about &quot;raw data&quot; (which is lawyer speak for &quot;statistics&quot;) so unless enough people bitch they will do nothing but dangle a carrot in your face.</div></div><hr />

How about also making the &quot;I'm here for the Pets&quot; account-wide? Even with higher drop rates, I can't believe anyone will get that before they get bored of expeditions...</div></div><hr />
