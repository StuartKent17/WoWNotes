<br />
Q &amp; A<br />
<br />
Q: Are Warfronts similar to invasions? What are the rewards?<br />
A: They will be built up to and up for a certain amount of time. The team is looking at other rewards such as invasions and timewalking in terms of rewards. Nothing is finalized yet.<br />
<br />
Q: Will basic reputations become account wide?<br />
A: Account wide unlocks try to focus on content unlocks over simple reputations. It is a separate set of goals that doesn't need to be account wide.<br />
<br />
Q: Is there a stat squish?<br />
A: Yes, there is another squish. The point isn't to nerf but bring everything in line. This time they are also squishing item level.<br />
<br />
Q: Is Anduin a Paladin?<br />
A: Anduin is still a priest. He is a hero character and so can do things normal priests can not.<br />
<br />
Q: Will there be cross faction chat?<br />
A: No cross faction chat at all except through battle.net. Community chat is character to character.<br />
<br />
Q: Are there any changes in the works to help with guild recruitment?<br />
A: Nothing planned right now, but trying to focus on social structures that are not quite as hard to get into.<br />
<br />
Q: Will mob health and damage be scaled as well with the new scaling of the old world? What about heirlooms?<br />
A: Team is looking to make the health and damage of mobs relevant to level. Heirlooms are scaled for level.<br />
<br />
Q: Any comments on artifact power/knowledge and how it influenced azerite?<br />
A: Decisions at the start of the expansion were a lot cooler than at this stage in the expansion. Team wants choices to be meaningful throughout the expansion and get rid of the crazy amount of power that needs to be obtained.<br />
<br />
Q: What was your thought process when bringing back raid buffs?<br />
A: There was something cool about the buffs going out before a boss. Team always looks at classes as unique and special and want to emphasize that. They don't want these buffs to be extreme but worthwhile.<br />
<br />
Q: How do you view PVP templates?<br />
A: Team likes the PVP talents, however, it is hard to put that into the outdoor world. They recognize how unbalanced world PVP is. Team wants you to be able to customize your character more in PVP. They are looking at the scaling technology to use within PVP, basically using the same tech that lets low levels party with higher levels. They are reworking the reward structure in PVP.<br />
<br />
Q: What about titanforging?<br />
A: There will be tweaks but not a fundamental change to the system. They want there to still be excitement in rewards. Titanforging will not happen on armor slots affected by the Heart of Azeroth, however.<br />
<br />
Q: Can characters get some sort of counter to push backs and knock backs?<br />
A: Niche for Death Knights , want to expand upon it for that specific class.<br />
<br />
Q: What do you plan to do about the character creation being archaic?<br />
A: Allied races are the start to this. Art team took a look at Allied races and are now going to incorporate that into the older races. More character customization is coming. Upright orcs are on the agenda. Barber will now double as a chiropractor!<br />
<br />
Q: Is Jaina a hero in Battle for Azeroth?<br />
A: She is complicated. Jaina is wrapped with regret. She was responsible for the death of her father and how the Horde is today. She is a damaged character and that damage will be explored. We will try to understand the way she is and try to pull her out of it. She is not evil, she is conflicted.<br />
<br />
Q: Why do so many bosses have holes in their ceilings?<br />
A: Functionally, there is no camera collision. Aesthetically, it allows team to show outside world without windows.<br />
<br />
Q: What are your plans for starting zones affected by the new expansion?<br />
A: No changes except for leveling improvements. In order to appreciate the impact of the events of Battle for Azeroth you need to understand it. Sharding technology will change the zones affected by these events for characters who are 110 and above. Other zones are also affected.<br />
<br />
Q: Will Void Elves be stuck in Void Elf form?<br />
A: It isn't like metamorphosis but they definitely have a void form and a more normal form. It is similar to worgen. They will go into the void in combat.<br />
<br />
Q: How will you address trinkets and titanforging?<br />
A: The rate of titanforging and warforging will be adjusted. Item level should win at all times. Relinquished system helps.<br />
<br />
Q: What about adding Mythic + to old dungeons?<br />
A: Good idea. Team is looking into timewalking keystones that are only available during the timewalking events.<br />
<br />
Q: How soon will flying be available?<br />
A: Same as Legion<br />
<br />
Q: What is the future of mobile apps moving forward?<br />
A: Team likes being able to stay in touch with character on the go and wants to continue it. Also want to merge armory app with these features.<br />
<br />
Q: Any chance of a consolidation for timewalking?<br />
A: Probably not all expansions active at once, but what other activities can happen during timewalking such as the outdoor world? WoD timewalking likely coming during Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Q: How do you keep people attached to their faction instead of switching sides?<br />
A: Play the game you want to play it. The new technologies allow for this.<br />
<br />
Q: What are your plans for legendaries in the next expansion?<br />
A: Azerite armor does what legendaries did in Legion. The legendary system from legion is not continuing into Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the quest log size be increased?<br />
A: Certain quests don't need to be in the log. Team wants to tackle this first. 25 quests is already too hard to manage.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the default backpack be increased?<br />
A: Very close to allowing the first backpack to slightly increase. In future patch if you have authenticator is attached to account your bag size will increase.<br />
<br />
Q: Will there be different raids based on factions/stories in raids?<br />
A: Definitely different stories. In terms of bosses, not so much. Looking further ahead faction conflict might play out in raids. Member of opposite faction could be raid boss.<br />
<br />
Q: Will exploits and bugs from Classic be fixed for the Classic servers?<br />
A: Turning to the community for answers. Team wants to recreate the experience as you remember it. They do not want bugs that cause crashes or severe issues, however. Should UBRS be 10 or 5 man?<br />
<br />
Q: Is heritage armor unlocked on all races?<br />
A: Heritage armor is only wearable by the race it is made for.<br />
<br />
Q: Will friends limit increase for battle.net?<br />
A: Team needs to make this happen and will eventually.<br />
<br />
Q: How will farming for ilvl specific greens be affected by scaling?<br />
A: The items will still drop and will scale.<br />
<br />
Q: How long will Warfronts last?<br />
A: Longer than dungeons, but team is still working this out. Beta feedback will help.<br />
<br />
Q: What classes are available to the Allied races?<br />
A: Allied races are unique and not linked to the other classes. Identity is taken into account when figuring out what classes the race can be.<br />
<br />
Q: Why are Nightborne Horde and Void Elves Alliance?<br />
A: All Allied Races have introductory quests that answer these questions.<br />
<br />
Q: What does the Legion ending mean for the demon hunter class?<br />
A: Demon hunters are ultimately night elves and blood elves. They will continue on protecting the world that Illidan loves. One day demons might return!<br />
<br />
Q: Are the continents completely split between the factions?<br />
A: Silvermoon is still Horde and Azuremyst is still Alliance. They are the lingering zones for their factions on these continents.<br />
<br />
Q: When will worgens/goblins get updated?<br />
A: Not in 8.0 but they are actively being worked on. Animations for Goblins are fine but they need visual updates. Male worgen are decent, but females need to be reworked.<br />
<br />
Q: Rewards for Opting into World PVP?<br />
A: Don't want to pressure players into opting in. The exact values aren't finalized yet.<br />
<br />
Q: Will the character slots per realm increase?<br />
A: Yes, 6 new slots per realm.<br />
<br />
Q: Cross realm trading?<br />
A: Figure out a way to do it without economy issues.<br />
<br />
Q: When is beta?<br />
A: Opt in at the website.</div></div><hr />

I'm Rolaxxon, warlock 120 level, PvP Player from the Burning Legion from the guild called Rocket Hamsters. We're recruiting anyway...<br />
My question is - why people in LFR kick me?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't need to go to prepared questions, they just need to start &quot;300&quot; kicking people off the Mic when they open with &quot;I'm Dumbass from ...&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Nothing to sift. Whatever they do, you're going to hate it, that much is obvious, so what does it matter what they say?</div></div><hr />

But that's how these panels always go. That's why all the good questions never gets asked because by the time we get to them. Time is up.<br />
Q&amp;A will never be good... Cause people spend 800 hours introducing themselves.<br />

Nope, nope, nope, i'm done, fuck this, pass, see you in 2 expansions.<br />

A) Everyone knows how hard it is to get them to respond to a Twitter question. They get a million of them, and it's a short response.<br />
<br />
B) On the street, there's no evidence. I asked Ion privately about ducks last year, but that doesn't really mean much if there's no video footage of it.<br />

<br />
Yes, you used to mess with things and do weird stuff &quot; back in the day &quot; because near the beginning it actually took you quite some time to level compared to things today so everything had more weight to it. Unless you're actively going out of your way to not level quickly, like not doing quests or dungeons, you level too quickly for there to be a need for these things. It's important for the sake of new players to start off with a basic toolkit and then unlock extra stuff as they go along so they don't get overwhelmed. A nexperienced player is going to be doing the leveling content for one of two reasons, either you're making a new toon to play at max level as quickly as possible or you're doing it because you enjoy going through the story on a new toon while learning it. Nether of which requires a talent system that has a ton of depth and meaningful choices because it doesn't improve the game play for what you're doing.</div></div><hr />

A: There will be tweaks but not a fundamental change to the system. They want there to still be excitement in rewards. Titanforging will not happen on armor slots affected by the Heart of Azeroth, however.<br />
Holy shit, how can the still not understand why this system is a problem?<br />
<br />
<br />
The rate of titanforging and warforging will be adjusted<br />
This doesnt do anything!<br />
If the proc rate is too low then you will be frustrated when the wrong piece gets titanforged, and if the proc rate is too high then you will be frustrated when the right piece does NOT get titanforged.<br />
This system is fucking stupid, it does not reward nor does it entice good play or progression, the only thing it does well is frustrate the ever loving shit out of me to the point where this alone might make me stop WoW.</div></div><hr />

My other questions were &quot;Why did Dalaran remove the monument of the Lich King's defeat from the center of the city?&quot;, as well as a resubmission of a question that was chosen last year but wasn't asked due to time constraints (Why are there no ducks on Azeroth?).<br />

That's 100% true. But you know, we'll be learning about BfA over the next several months. We'll learn about Azshara, the fate of our Artifacts, etc. And doesn't that make those questions irrelevant once BfA launches?</div></div><hr />

Well they said they liked talents but not the inability for people to choose their stats, they were talking more of a system like how a 105 and a 110 can attack the same mob for pvp to keep power levels within a range of each other while still not forcing you to use stats you don't think are right.</div></div><hr />

So, what you are saying now is; I don't care about the game enough to come up with relevant questions to endorse an insight of the next expansion but I am willing to troll and ask stupid, irrelevent questions &quot;No ducks in the game&quot; Your questions are not quirky nor fun.

Good lord, stop attacking the guy, he asked a question that mattered to HIM. People forget that there's a good portion of the player base out there who never raids, doesn't care what gear they wear, take months to level, possibly never hitting max.

What I meant was, the question says templates, but the answer says talents.<br />

They like talents but probably no templates, more like a dynamic scaling for pvp like how a 100 and a 109 can attack the same target. Also keeps you playing your character with your gear and your stat allocations.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As a Horde/Alliance player leveling up in zones in every expansion has been dwindling since the merger with Activison.<br />
As an example: REMEMBER I'M TALKING ABOUT ZONES YOU LEVEL UP AT LAUNCH. NOT AT MAX LEVEL or OVERALL THROUGH THE PATCH CYCLE.<br />
<br />
1)Burning Crusade we had 7. 8 if you chose Draenei or Blood Elves.<br />
<br />
2)Wrath of the Lich King had 8<br />
<br />
3)Cataclysm had 5 which are DeepHolm, Hyjal, Uldum, Twilight Highlands and vashj'ir. 6 if you are Worgen or Goblin.<br />
<br />
4)Pandaria has 7 zones. 8 if you play Pandaren.<br />
<br />
5)Warlords of Draenor has 4 zones. 5 zones per faction. Tanaan was added as late content.<br />
<br />
6)Legion has 4 zones.<br />
<br />
7)Now what about Battle of Azeroth??? <br />
The damn thing has 3 level up zones per faction. This is fucking horrendous.<br />
<br />
<br />
Another thing...What about crafting?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not at all. I care about the game a lot. For instance, orcs are capable of growing eyebrows (because Thrall has them). Why, then, do they remove them? Is it cultural? Is there a lore reason? We could've learned about in WoD!<br />
<br />
We have rubber duck fishing bobbers, but where are the ducks they're based on? There's a witch trial in the Alliance BfA demo (Dustvale? I think is the zone), and who wouldn't want a Monty Python reference in it? It seems like something Blizzard would totally do!<br />
<br />
But I'll put the ball in your court. What question would you ask that would endorse an insight on the next expansion? Do you think it would be chosen? Do you think people would applaud you? Do you think Blizzard will give you a generic answer?<br />
<br />
The Q&amp;A panel is a silly thing. And WoW is a silly game (we have a quest about killing eels!). And I'm sorry you think my silly questions are a waste of time.</div></div><hr />

Because the question mattered, just not to you, he wanted the answer. I paid to see this too, do I care the question was irrelevant to me? No, I didn't expect to see any real important questions answered because blizz would have said them themselves if they were going to (class changes, antorus, etc).<br />

<br />
Because quantity matters.... TBC leveling was ALWAYS horrendous, Wrath you really only leveled in 6 out of 8 of those zones, even at launch, Cata you really only did 4, hyjal (or vash if you are a masochist), TH, Deepholm and Uldum, MoP you only touched 5 zones, Vale was max level and I never set foot in krasarang (day 1 leveling), Draenor was considered one of the best experiences (only real good thing about it) with 4, Legion had 4, BfA has 3 but they're completely separate until max. The zones themselves don't even matter its the quests and how you get from 110 to 120.<br />
<br />
And at the same time, how much time is really spent leveling? BfA has the most ON RELEASE max level zones at 6, 3 of which you won't even touch till 120, but no, lets get caught up in boundaries, because they matter you know.<br />

Funny, between guild and friends I've heard nothing but praise (aside from a few outlining items like Arcano) and MMOC is far from unanimous on it. I for one love WF/TF and glad they are keeping it, even if it is lessened by ignoring a few slots.</div></div><hr />

Thank you sir, I very much appreciate your kindness. However I think we're actually having a pretty civil discussion at the moment (neither of us has started flaming yet, lol).<br />
<br />
You know, WoW is such a large and encompassing game. People from all walks of life play for a number of reasons, and those reasons change over time (I used to do heroic raiding back in MoP, now I'm a casual). If there's one thing I've learned, it's that people are passionate about this game. They care about it's pvp balance, they care about characters and lore, some people care about hidden things or battle pets. Like there's a ton of stuff to potentially care about! <br />
<br />
And that's all fine. I hold no animosity towards anyone, because they probably value a different aspect of the game that I do. And that's fine.<br />
<br />
I'm signing off soon to watch the concert, but I'll try to respond to posts tonight when I get home. :)</div></div><hr />

Yea, sorry, just annoys me when people are constantly like &quot;but that's not important!&quot; over and over because it doesn't pertain to them. So many different reasons to play the game, and people don't even realize the majority never touch anything outside of lfr, hell last MMO-C chart in WoD still had 40% not even doing that.</div></div><hr />

A: Turning to the community for answers. Team wants to recreate the experience as you remember it. They do not want bugs that cause crashes or severe issues, however. Should UBRS be 10 or 5 man?<br />
<br />
I'm not 100% sure but i think that UBRS started as a 15 player raid, was scaled down to 10 and later (i think it was around end of Wotlk or Beginning of Cata turned into a 5man Version so it was open for the Dungeon Browser and turned into a new 5man dungeon in WoD? <br />
Can anybody confirm this or am I totally off?</div></div><hr />

They said some would be baked into the core class and others would be going away, same as trinket and set abilities. I suspect some will also be moved to Azerite Armor pieces.<br />
<br />
I think a lot of this will probably have to wait until beta is underway to get hashed out. This is the kind of thing they're going to need a lot of solid feedback on.<br />
<br />
Honestly, it might be a good idea to start organizing threads for the different classes/specs so people can talk about which traits and legendary abilities they feel are the most important and iconic.<br />

Fml seriously? WHY?! Between Guild, friends, class discord, twitch, twitter, and MMOC I've heard almost a unanimous hate for titanforging. Why are they keping it?<br />
<br />
They said they were reducing how frequently it could occur, and that it'll only happen for non-Azerite Armor, didn't they? Or did you guys miss that part?</div></div><hr />

That's 100% true. But you know, we'll be learning about BfA over the next several months. We'll learn about Azshara, the fate of our Artifacts, etc. And doesn't that make those questions irrelevant once BfA launches?<br />

Unless you're actively going out of your way to not level quickly, like not doing quests or dungeons, you level too quickly for there to be a need for these things. It's important for the sake of new players to start off with a basic toolkit and then unlock extra stuff as they go along so they don't get overwhelmed. A nexperienced player is going to be doing the leveling content for one of two reasons, either you're making a new toon to play at max level as quickly as possible or you're doing it because you enjoy going through the story on a new toon while learning it. Nether of which requires a talent system that has a ton of depth and meaningful choices because it doesn't improve the game play for what you're doing.<br />

I miss Metzen for panels like this. There is so little charisma or passion on that stage. A lot of &quot;systems&quot; &quot;tweaks&quot; and babble about controlling the player's experience more and more fine grained. Where's the fun? It's like a status meeting at work, for god's sake. I appreciate the art director's honestly about character creation issues, but overall, this was just number crunchers reviewing spread sheets. Afrasiabi's response on Jaina was just flat and uninspired and dry. C'mon, Alex. This is a game. Have some fun. None of them looked like they wanted to be there.

Just like how Warhammer online, Rift, Guild Wars 2, Wildstar, Tera, Star Wars the Old Republic, The Elder Scrolls Online, Black Desert (etc etc etc) were all anticipated MMO's but didn't even come close to being as successful as WoW.

Excuse me?? Then WHAT THE FUCK IS MY PRIEST<br />
<br />
Well, considering he didn’t do jackshit the last two xpacs, while your priest was merely the only one capable of handling Light’s Wrath, he was probably off in some kind of “hero character” training facility that basically made him into a dual class warrior/priest. I understand Allies wanted a badass king after their last one got himself killed so good there wasn’t anything left to bury, but this is just so wrong on so many levels.<br />
<br />
Edit: Anduin becoming all badass is ruining the immersion quite a bit for me. They have been trying to convince us that we are important, leaders of our classes and what not, but this makes us seem like nothing more than a cog in the machine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Vanilla/Classic is all about the hardcore players. Players have evolved since Vanilla so Blizzard need to reflect this. RAID's should require at least 100 people, take at least 10 hours to complete on a perfect run and even the smallest mistake should nuke said player into oblivion. Levelling should require a group of at least five elitist MLG players so all the scrubs, n00bs and casual players stay at level 1 where they belong.<br />

Basically they meant that the allied races don't have their class choices based off existing races (like Highmountain Tauren from Mulgore Tauren). You can see the actual class choices for most of the new races on the BfA website.</div></div><hr />

While this is true, most memories of running UBRS were as a 5 man, even sans raid gear. I remember the drop from 15 to 10, by it was a weird one that didn't really require near that amount... though 40 man raids didn't really need 40 either &gt;.&gt; vanilla was weird.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Highelf</div><div class="date">2017-11-05, 11:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have been wanting High Elves for such a long time now. As someone who grew up on WC2, the High Elf rangers were always my favorite. And now that we have Alleria back, I thought for sure she would rally the remaining High Elves along with Vereesa and they would once again be playable for us and I could play as one of the legendary rangers of old.<br />
<br />
With the announcement of the Void Elves I was a little skeptical at first. I didn't want some purple tentacle looking thing running around. But now that they have a void form that you can switch from like a Worgen I am excited to see what the customization will be like. The fact that Alleria will be their racial leader it seems, is all the more reason for me to play this race at launch. They also seem to keep their blue eyes as well which is a plus. Alleria is able to look 100% normal when not using the Void, so I'm hoping for something similar.<br />
<br />
I wonder if Alleria will train her sister and then go back to Outland and gather up her original Ranger corp that is still holding the fort down at Allerian Stronghold. Taela Everstride would be awesome. Not to mention Theloria Shadecloak, who is depressed of how her people turned out throwing their lot in with Kael. She says that she has no desire to return home and that Terrokar is her home now. Well I'm willing to bet Alleria will 100% change her mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
A: It isn't like metamorphosis but they definitely have a void form and a more normal form. It is similar to worgen. They will go into the void in combat.<br />
They _might_ go into void form in combat as a requirement, or they might not. The statement was this will be dependant on community feedback and is currently in development.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: How do you keep people attached to their faction instead of switching sides?<br />
A: Play the game you want to play it. The new technologies allow for this. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this was an issue of transcription or simply a terrible answer. Ion _did_ say the initial remark, verbatim, but the bottom line was faction choice and loyalty is dependent on the player and not blizzard, apparently. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Q: Are the continents completely split between the factions?<br />
A: Silvermoon is still Horde and Azuremyst is still Alliance. They are the lingering zones for their factions on these continents.<br />
<br />
The comment that was used was it could be a &quot;way in&quot; for the respective faction. I think that is more ambiguous than is being stated here in the transcript.</div></div><hr />

Guess you don’t understand that there were 2 instances there; Lower Blackrock Spire, a 5 man dungeon and Upper Blackrock Spire, which was initially a 15 man raid that got scaled down to 10 man. So JAB doesn’t know what the fuck he’s talking about.</div></div><hr />
