I kind of welcome the Mimi changes for progression onto hard modes. My group isn't attempting hard modes until we have Yogg on farm for a few weeks, and a lot of our group doesn't turn up to Mimi because they suck on him. I felt my tank calls out &quot;Melee get out! ROCKET!!!&quot; a little too often and so that will be helpful, and also when the wanker chucks a new round of mines out and bam I have 2 land on me without me even seeing them, that'll be good.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing i could argue against is a slight tweak to overkill - i'd still make moves from stealth cost 10 less energy. I.e. cheapshot/garrote/ambush would be 10 less energy but after breaking stealth all moves would cost the normal amount. It doesnt really increase burst much but helps make initial openers cost less.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They moved it to 15% originally because if you had gotten the buff while already casting starfire, it would have been consumed. It was 5% before. Now they fixed the issue with it being consumed and gave it an extra 3% chance at that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ask anything u want, i'll explain. Every single change here completely makes sense unlike previous patch changes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Moritsume</div><div class="date">2009-05-27, 02:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The overkill change will definitely cut down on rogue burst in pvp, though I agree with the previous poster on wishing it would decrease opener energy costs by 10, then going to the new 30% increased energy regen. I don't see it as a big nerf, with 4 second stealth cooldowns you can keep that bonus going for awhile now with some gouge/pillar play.<br />
<br />
I do see this as a slight buff for PvE mutilate damage, 30% extra regen for 20 seconds, combined with a vanish will definitely help throw out more damage.<br />
<br />
I'm very excited about the CoI glove change for DK's and the extra CD on charge from Juggernaut :)<br />
<br />
Also, hurray Imp Barkskin giving extra armor in caster! No more worrying about going to cyclone only to eat a dps swap and die before you can go tree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I can already forsee some notes from patch 2.2 or 2.3 :<br />
Warlocks : Chaos bolt is now renamed Fire Ball, to match the mage spell it reflects. It still has a cooldown and costs 51 points though.</div></div><hr />

Already, more melee than normal was a liability on Mimiron due to so much stuff that was anti-melee - this is to give melee a fighting chance to not get insta-blasted. :P<br />

As a blood elf paladin trying to tank him, the hitbox alignment always seems to screw up and my toon ends up *inside* mimiron. <br />
<br />
Meaning a) I can't see targets on the floor if they appear under me and b) No matter WHERE I move when laser barrage occurs, I'm guaranteed to be hit by it.<br />
<br />
We *have* killed him, but each time it's been an annoying and risky game of taunting between two tanks to keep the barrage off the other tank due to hitbox issues. <br />
<br />
When the boss is under you (ie your chr model is inside the boss), you can't really circle around the boss out of the path of the lasers, I've found. <br />
<br />
Keeping him static when he does the barrage is a welcome fix to an incredibly messy mechanic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Is this really how you fix totems?<br />
You make 70% of them not stack with easier to do and longer lasting buffs and then completely ignore the shaman class afterward?<br />
<br />
Also. Near all other buffs aren't redone in the middle of a fight. We have to drop our totems again which costs quite a bit of mana guys.<br />
<br />
I used to love totems. They're now a joke like so much else in the game. Class mechanic? Yeah right.<br />
<br />
Hindrance on mana efficiency is all most totems are now.<br />
I wonder when our around 4 remaining useful 5min totems will be nerfed to not stack with other buffs.<br />
<br />
Don't even get me started on our nonexistent healing role, and the scarce reasons to bring more than one resto shaman to any raid.<br />

It was because that and your higher stamina multipliers allow you to easily take 2 hits from any 25 man boss in ulduar, whereas a warrior or paladin will have trouble there. When bosses are hitting for 20kish, block means nothing, and DKs don't lose itemisation on it so they get higher dodge/parry chances anyway. DKs were taking way less damage in those areas.<br />
<br />
Though granted, it's a change for that reason only, a warrior or paladin will destroy a DK on damage taken when the hits are smaller :S.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hmm, i thought they originally buffed by saying it wasn't strong enough, and mainly because of very small proc rate, thus it sucked. Now it's only slightly better than suck.<br />
<br />
Actually, it will be quite good. The fixed set bonus compared to my current gear will grant me over 100dps on stand still fights and even more on moving ones.<br />
True, the initial idea to buff the proc rate to overcome the bug was retarded and GC got really tons of bitching from owls for that :P but at least they did something usefull now.</div></div><hr />

The Retribution spec for Paladins are not near being the &quot;best&quot; PvP spec but still it's getting nerfed PvP and PvE wise, this time it was a PvP nerf which had no purpose at all. All they did was to make the spec even more useless and in-attractive for Paladins. <br />
<br />
I can't understand what blizzard is thinking of in these late patches, Instead of nerfing/boosting the specs that really need it, they nerf the specs who need boosts and boost some specs who definitely don't need it. I really hope they won't put this patch out in action but instead revise most of the changes in this next minor content patch to something that makes sense. <br />
<br />
I personally have a Paladin in retribution spec atm, but I'm sick of waiting on something good to happen. Time to change back to holy! :-\</div></div><hr />

strangest change i've ever seen for rogues...overkill used to reduce your energy cost on attacks by 10. now it increases your energy regen by 30% while stealthed and 20 sec after stealth breaks, this is kind of a buff i'd say for pvp.</div></div><hr />

Did some test and reach 11k with a paladin but only if both are Pve.<br />
I believe that 11k crit was from warlock who was in pve gear....<br />
Moreover, in pvp gear we arround 20% crit so we won't crit that often with cb.<br />
<br />
We forecast this nerf cause if someone see a big number in its combatlog he will cry and whine without trying to understand what cause him to take such a hit.<br />
Why did you take so hard ? You didn't dispell immolation which since patch 3.1.2 buff cb of 15% and you let the warlock cast 2x1.5 sec spell. That's what good arena player does to avoid conflag being cast too. Moreover in exchange of this buff warlock loose 10% damage of the conflag.<br />
<br />
However I do agree that destro warlock doesn't need anymore damage but it definitely need a way to escape rogue/warrior/paladin cause it's easy for the to come close to us but hard for us to escape them. demonic circle is often a joke in pvp.<br />
<br />
But ok let's say it has to be nerf. <br />
But why the hell does blizzard change the main reason of taking CB ? <br />
Only to avoid nerfing pve cause now destro is good for pve but not for pvp...<br />
<br />
Why should I botter taking a spell with a 12 sec cd, 51 points, which does the same thing as incinerate with a bit more dps ?<br />
<br />
So now we have lose 10% damage on conflag and the usefullness of CB in pvp. Great ^^<br />
<br />
Only becasue they are still trying to make talent working for both pve and pvp which for me is completely impossible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm sure that the change was needed for PvP, I don't think it's going to change much for PvE.<br />
<br />
What I do have issues with is that &quot;A nuke better than all your other nukes, but with a cooldown&quot; is about as boring as you can get with a 51 point talent. <br />
<br />
In my opinion the way it is now, it should be our level 75 spell, maybe nerf it a little and move some of it's scaling to deep destruction talents, so it isn't too good for either demo hybrids or (unlikely) affliction.<br />
<br />
They should than buff shadowflame a little and make that the 51 talent point destruction talent.<br />
<br />
I mean at level 75 it would mesh fine with frostfire bolt and Lava Burst, except that it's a little more boring than either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Where are these Resto Druid buffs exactly?<br />
<br />
* * * Improved Barkskin: This talent now also grants 80/160% additional armor while in Travel Form or not shapeshifted.<br />
* * * Improved Tree of Life: The armor bonus to Tree of Life Form from this talent has been reduced to 67/133/200% bonus armor.<br />
<br />
That's a nerf of 40% bonus armor and a buff to barkskin IN CASTER OR TRAVEL FORM.<br />
<br />
i.e. Tree of Life is being nerfed and Barkskin buffed so Druids can actually stay out of TOL form to use CC and still survive for more than 3 microseconds... They've traded allowing you to kill us quicker in TOL form for allowing us a chance to survive out of it. That's not a buff, that's balancing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rockets hitting ranged: removes some RNG from the fight, because for melee sometimes it was impossible to see the impact circle.<br />
Increased rocket flight time: well... kinda unneccessary, but not gamebreaking<br />
Static Mimiron during Laser Barrage: Good because of the obvious problems for tanks to hold him in one place.<br />
Proximity Mines: Arming time = good, reduced damage = unneccessary, but not gamebreaking<br />
<br />
<br />
As for the class changes: they are mostly pvp related, and because I don't pvp much, they barely concern me. But from what I see on the forums (besides the standard QQ), they mostly make sense, especially Rogue &amp; Warrior.<br />
In relation to the Chaos Bolt change, it would be good to know what counts as &quot;damage reduction&quot;. Defensive Stance, Shield Wall, Magic Resistance, Resilience (-crit dmg), Shields (e.g. PW:S), Soul Link, ...?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
He is a biatch on 25 man, though really it felt the only nerf that was needed to meke this beatable much easier was when Blizzard made assaultbots tankable. We one shotted him the next day after many, many attempts the previous week failing on the damn assaultbots.<br />
<br />
Ofc then we lost it and went back to badly sucking on this guy, even with a red beam that announces rocket strike. It is sad to have the feeling that it is n00bgroups like us that Blizzards bases the nerfs on ^^<br />

If these nerfs do hit the next patch I am deciding to quit this game because it is stupid and the people making the changes seem to be blind. What you are saying now is warriors get absolutely nothing but to tank in the game now. My evidence is the &quot;burst&quot; from warriors is ether there or your naked. Warriors have no cc to begin with and our major weapon in BC is watered down to the point where it causes more harm then benefits. I do solute the warriors that wear nothing but dps pve gear over pvp gear and do well in arena but at the same time you do nerfs, why don't they fix the god damn buggy bladestorm? Why not fix it instead of giving excuses on blizzard's laziness? There's so many more problems with this game I want to address but it would take weeks of me writing in this box constantly to bitch about all the problems with the game. Why nerf the warrior?? Why not just destroy the class completely and make us all reroll dk or pally? This game is stupid and blizzard knows it.

Something ive wondered since ive started this game is why do they not balance pvp and pve individually.<br />
<br />
Other games could, so dont see why WoW wouldnt be able to. Just change how buffs/dmg/heals and so on work if you hit/heal a pvp flagged target.<br />
Easy way to fix and balance both sides of the game without screwing one over when you change the other.</div></div><hr />

But, really.. It was needed, as in S5 it was ZERO warriors in the top 20 eu team. When juggernaut came, we swapt places with dks. But without Juggernaut, we had nothing in pvp... Wooow MS, whats the point when we lack burst as hell. Mages and priest could beat a warrior with 100% hp left. Cause we had a hard time to get close, and when we finally did, they just absorbed us to death. And really, juggernaut just gave us a chance to get through shields and barriers to do some dmg, and gave us some much needed burst! The first nerf, I accepted it after sometime, but really this one will kill warrior again in pvp.. And you guys who calls dk-pala-warr peope for crybabies, what about yourself? BLizz warrior critts me, pala hits me, dk spits meh! Priest are sick in pvp these days, druids are awsome, mages lack 2v2 stuff, but dude... Just go RMP and you have 2k rating.. And you rogues.. You get mad cause warrior beats you, have you really thought about.. Thats the only thing we can do? And 1v1 a rogue just ripps a warrior apart. Im tired of peoples who only think about WHAT YOUR CLASS GETS BEATEN BY.. And Blizz said after juggernaut came out, that they won`t nerf juggernaut to the ground.. WHAT WILL YOU CALL THIS? MAKE IT NEGATIVE SAME AS TG.. Thats it fellow warriors, we only got prot left.. But what I`ve read before.. It ain`t so good as the other tanks either..

so because p4 is challenging because of the bug it makes it actually more intensive for the tank. I like the fact that it is bugged so that the tanks actually have to do something.<br />
<br />
Also, the fact that they nerfed the rockets and mines just sucks badly! You really don't get my point do you....I think your fucking mentally challenged yourself.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been nerfing the fucking shit out of the raids ever since they deleted prequests for SSC/TK .....it annoys me to see idiots going in to raids such as Ulduar. <br />

<br />
I would predict that they'll fix the Charge glyph again after this - maybe not back full to 20%, but perhaps up to 10-15%. <br />
<br />
Also, as an arms warrior, I can't complain about the buff to Blood Frenzy. Should be interesting to see what that extra 4% of haste does for my DPS in PvE.<br />
<br />
The changes to Mimiron were coming no matter what. They're changing normal mode to work as intended, i.e. let johnny casual see Yoggy. Quit bitchin' until you've owned hard modes, as usual, and even once you own hard modes, you should has the discipline and understanding to keep your bitch-hole shut about normal mode 'nerfs'. Personally I'm glad we'll have no more wipes caused by a fucking invisible rocket in melee.</div></div><hr />

So what if he was a bit bugged in p4....it actually gave us tanks a little bit of a challenge to strafe around him without him moving....also the rockets are now made for fucking mentally challenged idiots that can't move fast enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hardly a nerf. Sure, it wasn't a hard fight before, but just because you haven't experienced the bug where the bottom part randomly moves (even if the tank doesn't) doesn't mean that it never happened. We had many attempts where the bottom would move through the tank during a laser barrage w/o the tank moving, and making all the melee get hit with barrage.<br />
<br />
Also, some people like to play with full graphic settings. You shouldn't have to turn down your graphics to see a very feint red circle in the melee through desecration, divine storm, whirlwind, etc. Also, many times rockets would hit under the boss, thus hitting melee without them even seeing the circle.<br />
<br />
Oh, nevermind. You've killed 2 bosses in Ulduar 25, and they were done 2 days ago. lawl. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">h4rr0d</div><div class="date">2009-05-27, 12:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so because p4 is challenging because of the bug it makes it actually more intensive for the tank. I like the fact that it is bugged so that the tanks actually have to do something.<br />
<br />
Also, the fact that they nerfed the rockets and mines just sucks badly! You really don't get my point do you....I think your fucking mentally challenged yourself.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been nerfing the fucking shit out of the raids ever since they deleted prequests for SSC/TK .....it annoys me to see idiots going in to raids such as Ulduar. <br />
<br />
Making raids accesable for everyone is just sad and bad! Note my words, Hardmodes are going to get nerfed also...timers are going to get expanded soon etc like hodir. Just wait and see in a few weeks. <br />
<br />
I can't believe that after almost 2 years blizzard is still listening to crying sons of bitches such as yourself.<br />
<br />
<br />
So they need to introduce bugs in order to make encounters challenging? So the 10 second lag we are experiencing every second raid is also an intended feat to make the content last longer for us? The Mimi changes are mostly OK. Longer rockets and lower mine damage is stupid, but the rest are quite good changes. Making the encounter more predictable is always a good thing. If you want something unpredictable, you can go to Las Vegas play one-armed bandits...<br />
<br />
Speaking of bugfixes, they could also fix YS. Was healing there yesterday on my druid, got gripped by constrictor just as I clicked portal to brain and after I teleported. Then, when boss finished casting Induce Madness I got MC'd. Yay.</div></div><hr />

Quite funny to see how the poster of this blog shows the op aspects of nearly all physical classes (and he is right with what he is writig), comments warriors with &quot;I don't quite feel that warriors are as overpowered as a lot people make them out to be&quot;, gives examples of some minior tweeks (which I find justified, imp harmstring for example) and then u read this patchnotes where warriors get the huge nerfbat again while lolret for example doesnt get anything :D<br />

<br />
They upped the armour of Frost Presence to help us tank because we were taking too much damage. Now it's back down because we're too good in PvP with extra armour?<br />
<br />
End result - Anyone with Bladed Armour now does less damage and less threat as a tank AND we take more damage. All this just so physical DPS can hit for 200 more damage per hit in Arena. Nice eh?</div></div><hr />

Let's see:<br />
DKs:<br />
He suggested the CoI bonus (which has long been clear to everybody who PvPs to be changed)to be changed to Death Grip Range. - Did NOT happen<br />
He suggested a Ghoul change. - Did NOT happen<br />
He suggested a Hungering Cold change. - Did NOT happen<br />
Ferals:<br />
He suggested several changes. - They all did NOT happen<br />
Hunters:<br />
He suggested a cast time on Aimed Shot. - Did NOT happen<br />
Rogues:<br />
He suggested Overkill (which everyone who does arena already knew would be changed because it was viable, if not the most viable to restealth every ~30 seconds just to proc Overkill) to be changed to... he didn't know what. - A change everybody knew about did happen<br />
Warriors:<br />
He suggested several changes to Harmstring glyph, Shattering Throw, Unrelenting Assault, etc. - They all die NOT happen<br />
<br />
His complains in the end - NONE of them were adressed<br />
<br />
In conclusion, out of his suggested ~15 changes, the two that were obvious to everybody happened - and not even in the way he suggested.<br />
<br />
If you believe Blizzard went after his suggested changes, you probably also believe in every fortune teller just because out of 10 predictions the one saying &quot;The sun is going to shine in July.&quot; is right.<br />
<br />

I understand some QQ about DK tank is too good in ulduar, but...not on all bosses. There are some boss which better be tanked with something else and etc, so basicly tank rotation was ok.<br />
<br />
However, blood tanking threat will be a problem with that. Bladed armor was nice...and now its almost totaly useless.<br />

How does a talent that's one of the best TPS/Talent Point talents in game suddenly become &quot;totally useless&quot; because of an armor change from 180% to 160%?<br />

Well it does effect blood threat a much :) You know its not a little bonus. I know all of you pvp freaks think that dk is a facerolling class, but because of changes like these, we need to change on our rotation and etc. Oh and yeah, it affects that. So basicly frost talent, as tanking talent will gain more advantage. Thats all :P<br />

Anyway..like i care...after that there will be a buff again. :P If we wont get our armor back, we will get something else. :)</div></div><hr />

As for the latest changes, I really hope they restore the Rapid Charge glyph to 20% after this.. Though really, it would be easier to balance Juggernaut if they just removed the added crit..

Denaro's trolling: elitist bullcrap. Mimiron phase 4 sports some of the worst bugs ever to plague a raid boss and makes the boss feel totally out of line with the rest of the Ulduar bosses. Rocket flight time and mine nerfs are uncalled for, the rest is totally valid.<br />

Bug Fixes<br />
Pulsing Spellshield: The stats listed in the tooltip for this item were incorrect and have been adjusted. This item provides 69 spell power, 34 haste rating, 42 critical strike rating, 45 intellect, and 45 stamina.<br />
<br />
This is an interesting approach to fixing something somebody should have noticed the first time they fixed this shield. The stats listed in the tooltip for the item as it is live aren't incorrect. It actually does give you the stats the tooltip tells you it will. <br />
<br />
The item is clearly over budget on something, as it is 7 item levels lower than Voice of Reason and gives it a close run for its money + 40 Stamina. But it is definitely not a tooltip bug fix. <br />
It's a shame to be losing this interestingly niche shield and getting a weaker copy of one I already had, but at least I can vendor it.</div></div><hr />

As much as i hate DKs in PvP (ima a mage) 1 of our raid tanks is a DK and i agree this change is BS the only balance it even brings to PvP is melee VS melee so not even as a pvp nerf is worth it.i do hope blizzard reads what you suggested and uses it cause its a great way 2 balance it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks. Now Chaos Bolt is basically Shadow Bolt doing fire damage and having longer cooldown and is 51pt talent! This also hurts PVE damage :/<br />
<br />
Usefulness dropped to level of Beastmastery 51pt talent.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Well, after browsing a bit it seems it doesn't take resistance ignoring away :L</div></div><hr />

Guess this will be the end of two rockets hitting the melee together, then. I'm also kind of glad for the mine's initial arming period change. I had it happen a few times when we were first learning the fight, and I know it's taken out others. But when the mine CD and the shockblast CD were offset right, sometimes people would get mines landing on them as they ran back in from shockblast.<br />
<br />
It's amusing to see the majority of these being PvP changes. I'm kind of with the group that's upset when PvP changes nerf your class when you don't PvP, but nothing changed here is too terrible. The 20% armor reduction for Frost Presence makes me feel even more naked as an Unholy Tank than ever, but I can always respec if it becomes a problem.</div></div><hr />

It's usually between 8k and 9k, and these don't happen very often since we don't get a lot of crit from our PvP gear. <br />
<br />
If you got hit for more than that I'm sure he was on his PvE gear.</div></div><hr />

I'd be much happier if they nerfed Desecration (INSTANT, ON DEMAND, NO COOLDOWN, NO ADDITIONAL COST FROST TRAP LOLOLOLOLOLOL) and made SOMETHING to mitigate Judgements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You people are retarded, they nerfed judgement damage by 20% when wrath came out, and another 50% in patch 3.1, they only fucking hit for like 1.9k and crit for 3k if we get lucky, they used to crit for 7k, stop bitching plz. We cant kill shit that has a healer on it, it's impossible, go QQ elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

Though really, it would be easier to balance Juggernaut if they just removed the added crit.. Warriors' problems were never the damage they dealt, it was just staying on target and not getting kited all over the place.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously. I'd take a removal of the +crit to maintain the current cooldown. Get to spend a talent point and now a glyph slot(if they even give us that) to maintain anything resembling mobility, and I'll still be unable to stick on a mage for any considerable amount of time with full duration freezes and 15 sec blinks all the time</div></div><hr />

About time. Going to 60% for just dpsing a paladin certainly feels balanced. Next in line: Vindication.</div></div><hr />

Then which players would be left to coin such useful and fascinating new words and phrases, such as PWNZORED, IMBA, L33t, ROXORS?<br />
<br />
I'm surprised that with the way the warrior talent trees work, they aren't adding a 40% armor reduction for 5 seconds each Shockwave in the prot tree, or a -25% hit rating during Bladestorm duration.</div></div><hr />

We know your trying to streamline all the classes. But that isn't how 8 Million players are gonna see it. Your fucking over Warriors, Priests, Shamans,Warlocks and Rogues. Classes that used to be top in alot of ways and equal to the other classes at the same time are now either broken and needed to be nerfed or need a fucking buff becuz you have nerfed them for stupid ass reasons. Give Priests their fucking heals back and stop kissing druids asses every patch. Stop Buffing Huntards every patch with more damage and give that buff to Warriors. Stop screwing with Warlocks everytime you get a chance and make us be able to raid without having to change spec every fucking patch. Buff the fucking enhancement tree for Shamans and stop making them to hard to raid with. And for once give Rouges a buff to rupture damn and bring back combat swords not fucking combat daggers/ fist. And stop giving pallies buff's for once. They are not warriores and never will be so stop trying to make them one.Holy damage is spell damage not fiscal. Thats fucking stupid. Blizzard I can honestly say I have thought very seriously about quiting. Your starting to fuck with stuff that wasn't broke. You can't fix what wasn't broke in the first place. Stop making your patchs around what will help players in pvp. If you can not please both pvper's and raiders then find a fucking way to stop screwing us all before you up in a patch. Testing a dumbass ptach on a test realm doesn't make it smart or right.</div></div><hr />

Paladins have gotten like 1 talent buff since wrath came out, and like 34 heavy nerfs, fuck off pally envy-er.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as a priest i must admit the whole charge/hamstring gets real annoying, so i can understand the nerf. i agree, if they must nerf something, they should look at druids. druid/warr teams seem outrageously op in arena atm, and i mean it's not limited to just that specific set-up, pretty much pick a plate dps, heck just pick any dps and pair him with a tree druid and bang!...success. (note, if you are incompetent, a good set-up won't help you win anyway, I‘m not speaking about these people) also this whole thing with ret being nerfed.. qq it was long overdue and i mean you should consider yourselves lucky that hand of freedom was all that got nerfed. <br />

<br />
oh and i really couldn't care what happens in arena change it for that sure go ahead do what you want for there but for pve stop blizzard just stop and think about what your doing i will send mensa round and get your IQ tested as i think at the moment it is similar to a potatoe.<br />
<br />
and woot no mage nerf yay oh but wait every other class other than lock and shaman(if i missed you i'm sorry) has been buffed to death since pre tbc when mages were sunwelled and you all know what that was like if you were a mage then, we are not op in anyway i salute the pvpers who can play mage well and survive long enough to do any dmg.<br />
<br />
how far and how many rerolls will it take for blizzard to realise that they need to rework every class in the game the way they made the dk(from the ground up) warriors rage needs sorted amounst so many other things and so many broken talents and abilities from years gone by that are still broken or were fixed and didn't need fixed.<br />
<br />
<br />
woot at blizzard what a bang up job you are doing with this ame lol.</div></div><hr />
