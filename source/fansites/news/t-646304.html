These features are NOT part of the patch 3.1.1a deployed today. You will have to wait a few more days/weeks before you can see them on live servers. <br />
Updated Argent Tournament Mounts<br />
In an upcoming minor patch, faction mounts offered by vendors on the Argent Tournament grounds will have their visual appearances improved. You will find that the mounts being offered will better match the colors of the faction you chose to represent. Mounts already purchased at the Argent Tournament will automatically be replaced with the updated mounts when this patch goes live.<br />
<br />
The ten mounts using the original tournament look will then be available for purchase from Argent Tournament vendors for 5 Championâ€™s Seals and 500 gold (faction discounts apply). To purchase these original mounts at the Argent Tournament, players must be either members of, or exalted with, the corresponding faction.<br />
<br />
Equipment Manager Coming Soon<br />
That's right, it's back! When enabled from the Interface Options menu, this feature will allow players to store sets of equipment, easily swap between saved sets using hotkeys, and pull items directly from backpacks or bank slots (must be at the bank to equip inventory from the bank).<br />
<br />
More information about the Equipment Manager originally slated for release with the Secrets of Ulduar content update can be found here: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/ui.html (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/underdev/ui.html)<br />
<br />
Neth, can you please clarify? There will now be 2 mounts per faction purchasable from the Tournament, correct? One for 100 seals and one for 5 seals and 500g?<br />
That is correct. One of those is the updated mount and one is the current mount just for an alternate cost. The currently available mounts will be the ones being updated if you've purchased it already. Otherwise, you'll have two options per faction. (This applies to the ground mounts.)</div></div><hr />

So if I read that right??? Does this mean that we get a seperate Paperdoll for the sets?<br />

That would be a GREAT addition to the GearManager</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since it says &quot;mounts already purchased&quot;, assuming you've done the dailies every chance you've gotten...It'd still take you past next tuesday to have the seal's to buy your first mount...<br />
<br />
And I really look forward to seeing what these &quot;Faction-colored&quot; mounts look like. And yey, easier to get 100mounts ^.^</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Only people that are Exalted with the Undercity. It says you need to be Exalted with the faction to buy the Tournament version. <br />
<br />
It's a nice change. I wasn't interested in any of the mounts since they were just another color. If the new ones are going to reflect the faction even more, maybe they'll be bumped up on my priority list.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That would be a GREAT addition to the GearManager<br />
<br />
No. There's a button above your gloves that opens a small window that kind of looks like the Macro window. You create a set and it will use the gear that is currently equipped. Then you can equip that set by clicking on the icon or clicking the hotkey that you assigned. If I remember correctly, there's also an update button to update the set.<br />
<br />
Been awhile since I tried it on the PTR :-[.</div></div><hr />

I hope the new mounts look cool! The Argent warhorses look really cool so I have some high hopes for these new models.<br />

<br />
<br />
um, if you actually read the posts, you'd see they said each city vendor would have 2 racial mounts in addition to the flying one they all sell.<br />
<br />
as it stands, each city vendor has 1 mount in addition the flying one they all share.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
O.K. TY! I was just confused as to if they were really adding one more to each vendor.<br />
<br />
I am working on my 3rd rep now so that will be nice.<br />
<br />
Also on a side note if they can make more mounts why can't they finish the so called druid skins they keep hinting at????????????????</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HotsPal</div><div class="date">2009-04-28, 09:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">zzz...it must be SO hard to RECOLOR existing mounts...<br />
<br />
why wasnt this crap done pre 3.1 release? <br />
i mean the kodo looks like every other kodo, the strider looks like the purple one, the org wolf looks just like black one...<br />
<br />
how about instead of just coloring them, you do something creative...put something on them to make them seem unique as well...like the amani warbear has glowing shit on the sides and such....but NOT that same idea.<br />
<br />
if your gonna recycle mounts and graphics atleast tune them up to be better than the original.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, except it's not possible to buy mount since even if you did all daily q everyday from patch day you have like ~50 marks which is half of mount cost...<br />
<br />
QFT. Mounts and mini pets are requiring crazy amounts of tokens. In some ways this is a good thing as it makes them rarer. But at the end of the day, it's just making an extremely long, long, LONG grind to get all of them. Or even just one for that matter; 20 days for just 1 mount, 100 days for all of them. Netherwing rep never took that long!<br />
<br />
In fact, instead of saving up for them by doing the dailies, you may as well just wait for the seasonal events. Hurray Brewfest mounts.</div></div><hr />

I guess I'm dumb then but I asked a question nicely, was not rude, and only wanted a clarafication as I said we were both reading it diffrently would it be tha hard to just be nice to me? <br />
<br />
ok so after looking at other blue posts I came across this one which is phrased better.... <br />
<br />
The current mounts in the game are being updated to the new look. If you already purchased a mount from the Argent Tournament vendor by the time this minor patch goes live, your mount will be updated with the new look automatically. The cost for the updated mounts (new look) will be 100 Champion's Seals.<br />
<br />
The mounts currently in the game will be given new names and will be available for 5 seals and 500 gold. <br />
<br />
so I got my answer</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
No, it can be in the bank as well (as was written) - you have to BE at the bank for it to get the items, but they don't have to be in your bags.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pumps</div><div class="date">2009-04-29, 12:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The gear manager isn't really exciting at all anymore.

<br />
<br />
Actually what it means is that you can store items in the bank as normal, in order to equip a set using those, you need to be at the bank at the time to withdraw them - which will happen automatically when you try to equip the set.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
so I got my answer<br />
<br />
<br />
There's an easier way to understand it.<br />
<br />
The current mounts are having their price changed to 5 Seals + 500g.<br />
<br />
The new mounts will be 100g.<br />
<br />
Much easier :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ComputerNerd</div><div class="date">2009-06-10, 11:14 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new mounts will still cost 100 champions seals - not 100g, while the old mounts will indeed cost 5 seals and 500g, with rep discount applying taking that down to 400g.</div></div><hr />
