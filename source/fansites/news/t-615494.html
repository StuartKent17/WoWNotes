Master marksman is NOT better now, what are you talking about? We get a raid buff, that doesn't need to get buffed since AotV is much better now, and a fairly large PVP/AP nerf (over the course of only two patches).<br />
<br />
It's like they can't make up their mind what should be the viable PVP spec so they nerf all the teirs. Thanks Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Seems to me that this is just increasing bloat for deep balance, while achieving very little else. i.e. resto druids will still be able to get the splendor and grace talents with 4 talent points, it just makes it shit for boomkins who most likely won't be picking up splendor, and now have to pay 3 points for a talent that previously cost one. And I'm pretty fucking sure that imp moonkin form didn't need a nerf. Their genius astounds me.</div></div><hr />

And yet there's a buff to Crusade to give it 3% OF ALL damage in addition to an additional 3% OF ALL damage against certain mob types (all the ones you'd find in arena, save hunter pets)<br />
<br />
Two hand weapon spec just increases the damage you do with Two handed weapons, not judgements or anything else.<br />
<br />
So crusade is a lower tier and is overall a better way to spend 3 points?<br />

<br />
400+ mana per tick of serpent and 400 mana per shot is crap? So 5 ticks of serpent gives you ~2000 mana? Not to mention you're also casting auto shots which also give you 400+ mana. LOL, I want to understand your thinking process. Because obviously you aren't talking about pve and you sure as hell aren't talking about pvp.<br />
<br />
Back on topic...<br />
<br />
Just try and understand Blizzard's logic behind the nerfs:<br />
<br />
&quot;Hunters do too much damage in PVE&quot;<br />
Ok, so we're gonna nerf a ton of their AP therefore we're going to give more crit and haste, which lucky benefits PVP more than PVE, but 5% haste in PVE is also killer.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hmmm, maybe 5% haste is too good&quot;<br />
Ok, so you give us 25% cheaper steady, which is now 2 second to cast and modified by haste, therefore the 5% haste would benefit a ton. But also AP is factored into your steady shot, so reducing AP and haste is a double whammy. Not to mention you're only going to get 19 autos for every 20 you'd get from the old version on top of the overall cast speed increase lost.<br />
<br />
If you look at the entire (MM) tree, it's heavily leaning towards being a raid tree. So they've gone from a PvP tree to a complete PvE hybrid tree? The whole tree is literally now based around steady shot with focused aim, piercing shots, master marksman, improved steady shot, marked for death. Now abilities like silence shot, barrage, improved barrage, scatter shot, and chimera shot feel extremely misplaced.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying every tree shouldn't be viable for PVP/PVE, but it's a joke that they are going to continously reduce the effectiveness of all the trees until they are reduced to near nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Am I being dense and missing something? Because looking at the talent calculator right now, it looks like Crusade will up ALL damage by 3% and an additional 3% damage to certain targets. Judgements, concecration, hammer of wrath, ALL damage, etc. <br />
<br />
And two handed weapon spec, which is deeper in the tree, is only giving me 3% damage from my weapon, so white attacks, crusader strike, divine storm, etc.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, because I'd love to be.</div></div><hr />

Every 8 seconds?! Brilliant!)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
5% haste in PVE is also killer.Can I have some of what you're smoking? Please? 5% haste for PVE is crap. Any good raid group will have Windfury for you, and once you have a quiver and either Serpent's Swiftness or Windfury, your Steady Shot is under 1.5 second cast. At that point, Haste ONLY affects your Auto-Shot, and thanks to the Mortal Shots nerf, Auto-Shot is now less than 25% of our DPS, meaning that 5% Haste is garbage.</div></div><hr />

I was fine with that, but now nerfing ours to 1/2/3% damage of JUST weapon damage is crap. Most Ret pallies prob won't even spend the points on it now since Crusade is SOOOOO much better now.<br />
<br />
They also nerfed Fanatasism... don't see the reasoning here. They already nerfed Judgement of Command so that it never does double damage it's just a guaranteed crit. That alone made Fanatasism less atractive. Does Blizzard not know that Ret is doing LESS damage then it should be at 80 right now?<br />

Any bonus is a welcome bonus and that five minutes is really nice depending on the situation. Its better for raids/instances over pvp because of boss fights but even in pvp it can be good. I mean 2 minutes is nothing and now they last over twice as long.</div></div><hr />

Ret paladins are still doing too much damage so thats why they got nurfed.<br />
<br />
All the talents that effected Chaos bolt before will still effect chaos bolt, it will just do a diffrent school of damage. Chaos damage. Like there are no resistances to holy damage, there are no resistances to chaos.<br />
<br />
Shadow flame was nurfed cuz it was too much like mages dragon breath damage wise, Free skill vs 40 point talent basicly, mages probably got pissed.<br />
<br />
I dont care about hunters or rogues.<br />
<br />
The 51 point dispersion talent was probably changed cuz it was just too good before, Its still very good tho for those saying its useless.<br />

Incorrect. Actually they made it even worse. They exchanged costs between Nature's Splendor and Nature's Grace, between one talent we would almost certainly skip and one which we would always guaranteedly take.</div></div><hr />

Seems like a bit of a strange wording, because if they wanted to remove the hit penalty they could've just left that sentence out completely. I think it's more likely to be a tooltip error.<br />
<br />
Edit: Just tested it while dual wielding one handers (dual wielding two handers doesn't work right now because of a bug) - the horrible hit penalty is still very much there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
HoJ NOW a SPELL INTERRUPT!<br />
Ghostcrawler:<br />
&quot;We did add the interrupt to Hammer of Justice. This was done solely so that Protection paladins wouldn't feel like they couldn't tank mobs that needed to be interrupted but were stun immune. We just think that interrupt capability crosses over the line into something that a tank needs to do his job. &quot;<br />

its not that huge<br />
yes it helps prot warriors for pve...but ret/holy pallys still remain interupt-less for pvp</div></div><hr />

<br />
And how can it be (who can explain it?):<br />
<br />
Shred, Rank 9: Shred the target, causing 225% damage plus 742.5 to the target. Must be behind the target. Awards 1 combo point. Effects which increase Bleed damage also increase Shred damage.<br />
<br />
Mangle, Rank 5: Mangle the target for 160% normal damage plus 507.2 and causes the target to take 30% additional damage from bleed effects for 12 sec. Awards 1 combo point.<br />
<br />
But: * Mangle doesn't increase the damage of Maul and Shred anymore.<br />
<br />
All in the same beta build. O_o</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Warriors and Druids have a talent increasing bleed damage by 30%<br />
- Shred increased damage by 20% on bleeding targets (with R&amp;T)<br />
<br />
Then when anybody in the raid has a bleed ticking, and Mangle/Trauma are up, Shred does 56% more damage. If you have an arm warrior, you may want to not mangle at all. I guess Nevbo was saying that keeping Rip up may sometimes become more important than those juicy Ferocious Bites crits :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Rake, Rip and Lacerate, and pounce.<br />
<br />
And a mob does not require a druids bleeding effect eather, Warriors Rend or Deep wounds, or rogues bleeding attacks work as well. The key here is that the mob has a bleeding effect on them.<br />
<br />
<br />
One of the druids highest dps abilitys is Rip, And with enough combo points it lasts long enough, esp with the new tigers fury/talent. You can keep Rip up along with the 35% AP buff to gain that extra damage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
We have atm:<br />
<br />
- A talent increasing bleed damage by 30% (Mangle)<br />
- Shred increased damage by 30% via Mangle<br />
<br />
Rake in useless, Punce is an opener, we can only use Rip in raids. Solo farming/PvP = manglebot (if Cat).<br />
<br />
In raids we have ca.<br />
<br />
- 40-45% white swing<br />
- 30% shred<br />
- 10% Mangle<br />
and only 15-17% Rip damage<br />
<br />
Now I crit for ~ 4200-4500 shred on Brutallus, 10% less (personal) damage is significant for such an encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
2.4.3:<br />
<br />
Shred = 130% damage (w Mangle)<br />
Bleed = 130% damage (w Mangle)<br />
<br />
3.0:<br />
Shred = 130% damage (w Mangle or Trauma)<br />
Shred = 156% damage (w Mangle or Trauma + Rend and Tear)<br />
Bleed = 130% damage (w Mangle or Trauma)<br />
<br />
If anything, Shred have a buff &gt; 10% of its current damage. Where is the problem ? *scratches his head*</div></div><hr />
