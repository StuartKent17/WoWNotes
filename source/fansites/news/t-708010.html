http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/hunter.jpg Cataclysm Class Preview: Hunter (Hunter Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-hunter/))<br />
<br />
With the upcoming World of Warcraft: Cataclysm many game elements will be changing, and each class will be receiving a number of tweaks. Here, we will explore the changes that are being made to the gun-wielding, pet-training hunter. The information you’re about to read is certainly not complete, and is only meant to act as a preview of some of the exciting new things to come. Without further ado, let’s take a look at the new hunter abilities!<br />
<br />
New Hunter Abilities<br />
<br />
Cobra Shot (level 81): A new shot that deals Nature damage instead of Physical damage. This ability will share a cooldown with Steady Shot. This will give hunters an alternative to Steady Shot on heavily-armored targets, and we will have talent incentives in the Beast Mastery tree to make this a signature shot.<br />
<br />
Trap Launcher (level 83): When used, the next trap can be shot to a location within 40 yards. This provides the current Freezing Arrow treatment to all traps and, as a result, we will be removing the current ability Freezing Arrow. 1-minute cooldown. No global cooldown.<br />
<br />
Camouflage (level 85): The hunter enters an obscured state that prevents him or her from taking ranged damage. The character would still be subject to melee or area-of-effect attacks, and dealing or taking damage will break the Camouflage effect. The hunter can move and set traps when under Camouflage, and will receive a damage bonus when attacking while under Camouflage (which will then break the effect).<br />
<br />
Resource Mechanic Change<br />
<br />
Here we come to the meat of the upcoming hunter changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;ul&gt; Hunters will no longer use mana; instead the class will use Focus. Focus generates much like Energy, by building up. It will not be affected by Intellect at all. Haste will improve its generation. Hunters will generate roughly 6 Focus per second, slightly less than rogues' Energy generation rate of around 10 Energy per second. Below, we have listed some examples of how we intend Focus costs to operate:&#13;&#13;&lt;ul&gt; Steady Shot/Cobra Shot: No cost. Generates 9 Focus per shot (or 12 per second instead of 6).&#13; Arcane Shot/Chimera Shot /Explosive Shot: 45 Focus.&#13; Aimed Shot/Multi-Shot: 60 Focus.&#13; Concussive Shot/Tranquilizing Shot: 35 Focus.&#13; Rapid Fire/Master’s Call/Disengage: 30 Focus.&#13;[/list][/list]<br />
<br />
Changes to Abilities and Mechanics<br />
<br />
In addition to the resource change and new abilities listed above, we intend to make adjustments to some of the other abilities and mechanics you already know well. This list and the summary of talent changes below it are by no means comprehensive, but they should give you a good sense of what we’re going for with each spec.<br />
<br />
A major change coming for the hunter is the removal of ammunition. Guns, bows, and crossbows will now do damage without consuming ammunition at all. There will be no more ammo slot on the hunter’s character display. Any ammunition that a hunter has at the time of the change will become gray sellable items. Existing quivers will be converted into large bags -- though each hunter can only have one and non-hunters will not benefit from this change -- and we will not be making any additional quivers.<br />
<br />
Pet management will also change. Hunters will now have two types of attainable pets: active pets and stored pets. Hunters will be able to have up to three active pets (perhaps five for Beast Mastery specialized players) and will have the ability to switch among these pets any time they are out of combat, without going to town. They will also be able to have a large number of pets in storage at the stables. In order to swap a pet from active to passive, a hunter will still need to visit their local Stable Master. However, this should afford ample storage for the many Spirit Beasts wandering the lands of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;ul&gt; Additionally, hunters will now start with a race-appropriate pet at level 1 and will be able to tame a different pet at level 10. We are also changing many pet family abilities to provide important buffs and debuffs. The intention is to allow the hunter to be able to swap pets and fill a position if a certain role is missing from the group. The goal is to have all pets provide a damage increase that is very similar and no greater than any other pet. Some examples of the changes we are making to the pet families are listed below:&#13;&#13;&lt;ul&gt; Wind Serpents: Will provide a debuff that increases the amount of spell damage taken by an enemy (similar to a weaker version of the warlock ability Curse of Elements).&#13; Ravagers: Will provide a debuff that will increase an enemy's Physical damage vulnerability (similar to a weaker version of the warrior ability Rampage).&#13; Hyenas: Will provide bleed damage (similar to a weaker version of the druid ability Mangle).&#13;[/list][/list]<br />
<br />
Stings and other periodic effects will now benefit from haste and critical strike ratings. Hasted damage-over-time abilities do not lose duration, but instead add additional damage ticks.<br />
<br />
Viper Sting will now restore 9 Focus every 3 seconds.<br />
<br />
We are reinforcing hunters as a ranged class. To this end, the class will now start with ranged abilities at level 1, and we will be removing some melee abilities, such as Mongoose Bite.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Talents and Talent Changes<br />
<br />
Beast Mastery hunters will have a new talent called Careful Aim, which increases the damage of the next Steady Shot or Cobra Shot, but also increases the cast time of these abilities. The intention is to make the combination of spells into a decent damage opener, especially in conjunction with the new ability Camouflage.<br />
<br />
Beast Mastery hunters will also have talents that make Cobra Shot superior to Steady Shot, such as Longevity reducing the cast time of Cobra Shot to 1.5 seconds.<br />
<br />
Rapid Recuperation will cause Rapid Fire to give 20/40/60 Focus immediately and will cause Rapid Killing to generate 3 Focus per second.<br />
<br />
Efficiency will reduce the Focus cost of Chimera Shot, Aimed Shot, and Arcane Shot.<br />
<br />
Thrill of the Hunt grants Focus when you land a critical strike.<br />
<br />
Hunter vs. Wild increases the hunter’s Focus generation when his or her pet is snared, stunned, or rooted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery Passive Talent Tree Bonuses<br />
<br />
Beast Mastery<br />
Ranged Damage<br />
Haste<br />
Pet Damage<br />
<br />
Pet Damage: Many of the passive benefits to pet damage will no longer be available in the Beast Mastery talent tree. However, these will be provided through the new Mastery mechanic.<br />
<br />
Marksmanship<br />
Ranged Damage<br />
Armor Penetration<br />
Double Shot<br />
<br />
Double Shot: The hunter will have a chance to launch a free attack off of the global cooldown for 50% damage.<br />
<br />
Survival<br />
Ranged Damage<br />
Ranged Critical Damage<br />
Elemental Damage<br />
<br />
Elemental Damage: Hunter abilities such as traps, Black Arrow, and Explosive Shot will do elemental damage of the following types: Arcane, Fire, Frost, Nature, and Shadow.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoyed this preview, and ask that you provide your initial thoughts and feedback on what was presented here. Please keep in mind that what you’ve just reviewed is a work in progress and as we move closer to the Cataclysm beta, you’ll see these planned changes as well as others continue to develop in response to feedback and testing. <br />
<br />
[...]<br />
<br />
A clarification of Camouflage and what becoming obscured actually means:<br />
Camouflage is *not* stealth. Your enemies will never wonder where you are. We're trying to use the new Cataclysm water effect to put a shimmering PREDATORy visual on you. It's protection from ranged attacks and it gives you some combat bonuses, but it's not like Shadowmeld or rogue / druid stealth where players can't find you.<br />
<br />
The idea with it is that Hunters are only vulnerable to melee attacks or ranged AEs while they are in the obscured state. If you target a camo hunter or a rogue using Smoke Bomb, you will get an error message saying something like &quot;Target obscured.&quot; You can see them and target them, but can't use your attacks. Imagine they are behind a pillar or something. You can try and get off an AE near them or you can move to melee.<br />
<br />
As most of you know, we tried Camo once before, but because it was true stealth it was very hard to balance, plus it felt like we were just handing out the same cool abilities to every class instead of coming with unique mechanics. Hunters were so overwhelmingly excited about the basic idea that we wanted to try it again, but not as stealth.<br />
<br />
Regarding Cobra Shot sharing cooldown with Steady Shot:<br />
At this point in time it's not actually a cooldown. Cobra Shot has a 2 sec cast time, but Beastmaster has a talent to reduce the cast time to 1.5 sec (as well as a few damage hooks). Both generate focus so there is no reason for BM to ever use Steady again.<br />
<br />
Regarding focus and how much of it Hunters will have:<br />
Hunters will get 100 focus<br />
<br />
The focus costs mentioned in the preview are just examples, so it is a little too soon for you to try to min / max your rotations just yet. In general, the basic rotations of all three hunters work okay on live today. With focus you might hit moments where you don't need to Steady at all, and you'll never run dry again for long periods of time like you might with mana.<br />
<br />
If the costs of some of the defensive cooldowns are too expensive or even need to be free that's certainly the kind of thing we'll consider.<br />
<br />
Regarding Ammo in Cataclysm:<br />
There is no ammo slot on your character sheet in Cataclysm. It no longer exists. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Recruit-A-Friend Mount Update<br />
While we had originally announced the new Recruit-A-Friend X-53 Touring Rocket reward would be coming in just a few short days, it turns out there are still a few bolts to tighten, some loose wires to tuck inconspicuously under the upholstery, and a handful of parts leftover that we’re going to ponder and then assume we can safely throw away. As a result, we’ll be releasing this beauty a bit later than we’d first anticipated. This will also give anyone interested in the current Zhevra mount reward some extra time to claim one. While we don’t have an exact release date nailed down yet, we’ll make an announcement once the new mount becomes available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I also like how they've basically just given up and acknowledged that a lot of people play a hunter to just collect pets, and that five slots isn't nearly enough. Sounds like we'll be getting a giant barn to house our zoo in.<br />
<br />
edit; I am seriously wondering if they'll still have survival hunters granting replenishment. It remains one of the best reasons to bring a survival hunter into a raid, so would they really remove it, thus basically making survival hunters devoid of any raidwide buffs?</div></div><hr />

This includes spells too. Maybe only spells that are more than 10 yards though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm nervous about how focus and steady shot are going to affect us in arena. If we need steady shot to get focus and its still a channeled ability, our damage output is going to be pretty bad. Maybe steady shot will be instant cast...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
how much I know Hunters had Energy or focus in Alpha WoW or even Beta but playerbase asked to change it to mana so we are not changed but more like changed back.<br />
<br />
<br />
tho Concussive Shot/Tranquilizing Shot: 35 Focus.<br />
<br />
guess I will clearly refuse to dispell enrages now.. guess it will be Rogue duty now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will it be a stealth like state? Unlikely, as melees can obviously attack them according to tooltip. I suspect it to be something inbetween, where the hunter is transparent and you may select him, but no nameplate will be shown, unless clicked.<br />
<br />
And regarding the mount...I really ask myself what could have prevented the launch. That really sucks. :(</div></div><hr />

Hardly any effort went into the new abilities at all. and once again....................99% aimed at pvp.<br />

been same on all classes. face it, in blizz's eyes, pve is dead.<br />

Trap Launcher's cooldown should be lowered to 30, or at least 45 seconds and I still don't know how Camouflage works exactly. Is it actual stealth?<br />

The rest is.. okay.. but still &quot;meh&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
[b]Camouflage (level 85): The hunter enters an obscured state that prevents him or her from taking ranged damage. The character would still be subject to melee or area-of-effect attacks, and dealing or taking damage will break the Camouflage effect. The hunter can move and set traps when under Camouflage, and will receive a damage bonus when attacking while under Camouflage (which will then break the effect).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So does that mean they can still be seen when under the effects of camouflage? So it's not like a rogues stealth?</div></div><hr />

Hopefully it will look like a rogue looks in stealth, only you can spot them normally, you just can't attack them from range.</div></div><hr />

You get to be an actual hunter at level 1, with pet and ranged abilities and you COMPLAIN?!<br />

<br />
The changes to managing pets and switching them around out of combat depending on boss fight or trash clearing sounds great, Trap Launcher sounds useful for actually getting Snake Trap into rotations (if you used it for certain boss fights like dumping it on top of adds during Anub in ToC without having to move much you'd see the poisons being shot everywhere) but Camoflague sounds rather vague. They're not very clear on whether it's a real form of Stealth or not, not that it matters if I read it correctly - you'll always be walking around with 3 pets around you at all times.<br />

As most of you know, we tried Camo once before, but because it was true stealth it was very hard to balance, plus it felt like we were just handing out the same cool abilities to every class instead of coming with unique mechanics. Hunters were so overwhelmingly excited about the basic idea that we wanted to try it again, but not as stealth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But on a serious note, wtf are these crap-changes. Woho a trap-launcher... and a cobra shit (typo: shot)... and last a rogue-stealth-skill I was expecting something really groundbreaking and fun.... <br />
For example ditching the pet in the Marksman-tree and convert that dps into the hunter... marksman should be the &quot;lone ranger&quot; tree imo. <br />
What about a better disengage (i.e. not having to have an enemy target to use it) or some kind of shadow-hunter effect that works like mirror images but only one (i.e. a shadow-copy pops up and does some decent dmg while making ppl drop you as target + some threat-dumping as well due to hunters excessive threat).<br />
<br />

For all we know, there may be super secret stuff Blizz tucked away that will blow us away come Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
The pet at lvl1 I think was needed imo, was just really annoying having to grind your way to lvl10 without one, one of the reasons I hated leveling my hunter. Course, now he's 80 and one of my favourite characters (along with my Tankadin). <br />
<br />
Sure, some might not agree, but I keep the idea that until I actually use these abilities myself I won't judge them (similarly to how I waited for the new Doctor Who before saying what I thought, and I like him :3)</div></div><hr />

I also like how they've basically just given up and acknowledged that a lot of people play a hunter to just collect pets, and that five slots isn't nearly enough. Sounds like we'll be getting a giant barn to house our zoo in.<br />
<br />
edit; I am seriously wondering if they'll still have survival hunters granting replenishment. It remains one of the best reasons to bring a survival hunter into a raid, so would they really remove it, thus basically making survival hunters devoid of any raidwide buffs?<br />

Pet management will also change. Hunters will now have two types of attainable pets: active pets and stored pets. Hunters will be able to have up to three active pets (perhaps five for Beast Mastery specialized players) and will have the ability to switch among these pets any time they are out of combat, without going to town. They will also be able to have a large number of pets in storage at the stables. In order to swap a pet from active to passive, a hunter will still need to visit their local Stable Master. However, this should afford ample storage for the many Spirit Beasts wandering the lands of Azeroth.<br />
<br />
this is a great one u can change your pets every other fight to best suit the situation</div></div><hr />

Hunters honestly do not need many more PvE abilities. BM got its new and different shot with Cobra Shot, which I'm going to guess is going to have a lot of related talents to it in the BM tree.<br />
<br />
<br />
i like focus and camo seems like a good ability. but some of the changes are weird extending the cast time on steady shot and cobra shot? going back to 3 second aimed shot essentially. trap launcher seems clunky like ill click trap launcher then my trap i want to use then actually fire it. or ill need to have 5 keybinds for each trap i want to launch. i was more hoping for a consolidation of abilities rather than getting more stuff to press. <br />
<br />
Trap launcher looks to be its own ability off the GCD. You hit it, and then the next trap you use will essentially work exactly as freezing arrow does right now. I prefer this; I'll just be replacing my freezing arrow bind with trap launcher.<br />
<br />
<br />
i have a feeling camo will be removed late in beta XD<br />
<br />
<br />
There would be so much QQ if they did, and it would be a pretty major fail on Blizz's part, as camouflage was something hunters had in the original beta, and they failed to implement it well then. I doubt they want to fail at it a second time :P</div></div><hr />

So I always played as hunter because I liked the &quot;kiting&quot; mechanic. <br />

Im hoping its more along the lines of more pets species ability mimics a debuff brought by another class (just slightly less effective like kings vs drums of forgotten kings) and pet switching then becomes more of filling in the debuff you don't have</div></div><hr />

Seriously, it is a good tool. In ICC, I would usually go into some trash, set an Explosive Trap, Disengage, and Volley. The AOE damage is awesome. This makes it so I don't have to do the movement, thereby increasing my DPS. <br />
<br />
And the talents for turning Cobra Shot into the main BM shot is...a rather weird method. However, I can dig it. BM needs a signature shot.<br />
<br />
As a Hunter main since TBC, I am very interested to see how this will work out. The Focus change will take some getting used to, but it shall be an interesting relearning experience, to be sure.<br />
<br />
<br />
The only problem I have with Camouflage is the same I have with Smoke Bomb. AoE works against both. Balance druids can easily throw a typhoon, and several other classes have easy AoE abilities.<br />
<br />
The concern IS valid, but to be honest, being unaffected by ALL ranged attacks for an undetermined amount of time might be considered a bit OP. Plus, I could see Hunters wanting to use it in PVP only to use the sudden burst at the beginning, which may mean not being visible until the time is right. It's how I see them using it in PVE, at least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Two melee attacks (Raptor Strike and Mongoose Bite) and a no damage snare only viable as a kiting tool in situational use in PvE and more use in PvP was never going to make Hunters very balanced in melee or close range. Raptor Strike actually seems like one of the most lame in game major glyphs there is right now - not that hunter glyphs are anything to brag about - but there hasn't been much of a melee hunter, ever, since the game was launched. Aside from a few lucky close range criticals with melee attacks you'd be fighting to remain at ranged most of the time anyway. I am hoping that they don't remove Wing Clip - it's a very iconic Hunter spell at least, and essential to PvP - and losing Mongoose Bite (losing any instant cast damage attack is a reason to be a bit disappointed) is a bit meh, but honestly, how many times do you use it compared to other attacks? Trap Launcher itself seems designed with the whole intention of making 5 Hunter spells actually being useful at ranged should the situation present itself. <br />
<br />
I'm hoping there'll be a redesigned talent or a glyph that gives a remaining melee range attack or survival tool past Deterrence and Disengage so we won't be utterly useless after a 30 second cd untalented and unglyphed has been used and a 1 min survival tool that prevents us from doing anything really useful have been used up, probably something with Wing Clip - reduces the snare effect by 10% but reduces damage you take by x% / increases your speed by x% for 5 seconds.</div></div><hr />

Guns, bows, and crossbows will now do damage without consuming ammunition at all. There will be no more ammo slot on the hunter’s character display. Any ammunition that a hunter has at the time of the change will become gray sellable items. Existing quivers will be converted into large bags -- though each hunter can only have one and non-hunters will not benefit from this change -- and we will not be making any additional quivers.<br />

Does your hunter drool on himself in that example also?<br />
<br />
Mage begins to cast spell<br />
Hunter Camo's<br />
Mage's spell does no damage, so he switches and begins to cast Blizzard<br />
(smart) Hunter starts his rotation again (with the +damage bonus) before the Blizzard hits<br />
Mage has wasted mana and is hitting the Hunter with Blizzard (which does less damage then any of his single target spells) while being nailed by the Hunters best shots.<br />

Camo IMO is a great ability and a soft counter for a lot of single target ranged spells (with a cast time).</div></div><hr />

<br />
WTB Aspect of the focus...<br />
<br />
Of course not. Our shots are all on fairly decently long cooldowns as they are. What this is going to do is make steady shot weaving part of a hunter's playstyle again, instead of simply being the boring filler shot between cooldowns. Picture this timeline:<br />
<br />
You have 100 focus<br />
0 seconds: Aimed shot, 40 focus<br />
1.5 seconds: focus regen to 46 focus, chimera shot, 1 focus, chimera crits, regen to 7 focus<br />
3 seconds: (assuming for the sake of argument, steady shot hasted to 1.5 seconds) steady shot, 20 focus<br />
4.5 seconds: steady, it crits, regen to 26 focus, 31 focus<br />
6 seconds: steady, crits, regen to 37 focus, 45 focus<br />
7.5 seconds: chimera shot, 0 focus<br />
<br />
<br />
This is just assuming some of the values behind the focus regen talents. Of course, your focus will regen faster with more haste and depending on your talent distribution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Well, it should be obvious by now we probably won't see many new &quot;core&quot; abilities. If you think about it, most classes have a decent palette of attacks to use, and it would be hard to create something that wouldn't take the place of something else in a standart rotation.<br />
<br />
What we DO see a lot is situational attacks to compensate a class' weak spot: Priests got a-go attack for weak trash, DK and Rogues got the same treatment for their diseases and combo points, Shamans got a nifty tool to do SOMETHING when in movement, and Warlock to refresh non-instant dots.<br />
<br />
In many ways, I see most classes has not having further specialized, but to have reflected on their weak spots, and tried to compensate in their class-specific ways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the only thing i never like about hunters is they are so reliant on healers in pvp, hence i always preffered to play shadow priest, mage and rogue. hopefully with the focus changes alot of abilitys have their cooldowns cut back such as feign death, disengage, masters call, deterence, etc. as it stands im sticking it out as a shadow priest unless the druid or mage preview &quot;wows&quot; me</div></div><hr />

60 focus for aimed shot... with 6 focus per sec its 10 secs...<br />
So basicly you can only autoshot for 10 secs to be able to use aimed shot after 10 secs. Unless ofc you have time in pvp to spam those 2 sec steady shots...<br />
<br />
Also, why rapid fire etc costs focus while rogue cd's are free? hunters to this have 40% slower resource regeneration.<br />
<br />
If this values of focus and focus regen go life, its literally the end of hunters in pvp, unless aimed will take 50% of enemy life in 1 shot or simple autoshot will deal so much dmg that healers are going to have problems with healing it up...<br />
<br />
Seeing this i start to appriciate having mana...<br />
<br />
Also greatly disapointed by new skills. <br />
new version of steady shot and new version of freezing arrow... Gr8 2 new unique and exciting skills lol.<br />
And camouflage kind of sucks too. <br />
1 hunters already have 10 secs of imortality, now also camouflage?<br />
2 if camouflage is going to give its dmg increase right away its going to be macroed in pve, if its going to charge for a while for greater effect it makes it unreliable in pvp. In fact its unreliable anyway as long as dots exist and last time i checked pretty much every class has dots...<br />
<br />
Oh well, i guess its time to forget about playing hunter in cataclysm :(<br />

Edit.<br />
<br />
With no idea of talents :<br />
<br />
Any shot using a GCD, the real cost over time will be reduced by 9.<br />
Assuming standard haste, Steady will use a GCD and grants 18<br />
<br />
So we have chimera/arcane/explosive costing 36, Aimed cost 51 and Steady grants 18....<br />
So a &quot;special&quot; costs 2 Steady and an Aimed cost 3 Steadys.<br />
<br />
All of this before talents, mastery, CDs, gear with tons of haste, etc... I see easy rotations coming.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We hunters were BEGGING for energy back in Vanilla and Early BC, mainly becuase we would OOM faster than any other class. They finally fix the mana system by giving us intellect AND the spec to add Intellect as AP, and things worked great. As a matter of fact, i LOVE the way my toon is right now. It's like I ordered a pizza in 2005, and never got it. So instead i got chinese and was eating chinese ever since, until today, when the pizza delivery guy shows up with the pizza 5 years late... I mean, yea pizza does rock, but its no longer what I need.<br />
<br />
Every single non-mechanic change they made to Hunters is phenominal. Trap Launcher, Camo, tossing all melee crap, pets and ammo changes, stings being affected by haste. Amazing. But i'm afraid to see how intuitive this focus system can be. During my normal progressions, i fire anywhere from 1 to 3 steady shots before my next shot is off cd. I never have to fire more than 3, which by this would regen about 27 ammo. I can only ASSUME that CDs will be removed from all hunter shots, but i didn't read anything about that. Posting on official boards now to confirm. <br />
<br />
I just dont understand why the change is needed. I'm sure i'll learn more by doing, rather than worrying, but until then, i'm left with only my mind. And a Hunter's mind is a terrible thing.<br />
<br />

<br />
I imagine they'll shorten the cd on the trap launcher to like 30 secs or whatever the cd on your traps are at that time. A 1 min cd is kinda lame and overshadows/nerfs our lvl 80 ability completely.<br />
<br />
What they're doing with pet abilities sounds cool. That might stop some qq about how 'hunters are the most useless class in raids.' Kind of makes us a jack of all trades.<br />

Camouflage sounds like it could be cool... maybe. I'm just hoping it won't be as disappointing as freezing arrow was.<br />

60 focus for aimed shot... with 6 focus per sec its 10 secs...<br />
So basicly you can only autoshot for 10 secs to be able to use aimed shot after 10 secs. Unless ofc you have time in pvp to spam those 2 sec steady shots...<br />
<br />
Also, why rapid fire etc costs focus while rogue cd's are free? hunters to this have 40% slower resource regeneration.<br />
<br />
If this values of focus and focus regen go life, its literally the end of hunters in pvp, unless aimed will take 50% of enemy life in 1 shot or simple autoshot will deal so much dmg that healers are going to have problems with healing it up...<br />
<br />
Seeing this i start to appriciate having mana...<br />
<br />
Also greatly disapointed by new skills. <br />
new version of steady shot and new version of freezing arrow... Gr8 2 new unique and exciting skills lol.<br />
And camouflage kind of sucks too. <br />
1 hunters already have 10 secs of imortality, now also camouflage?<br />
2 if camouflage is going to give its dmg increase right away its going to be macroed in pve, if its going to charge for a while for greater effect it makes it unreliable in pvp. In fact its unreliable anyway as long as dots exist and last time i checked pretty much every class has dots...<br />
<br />
Oh well, i guess its time to forget about playing hunter in cataclysm :(<br />
Can just hope that some1 will finally fire ghostcrawler <br />

<br />
I'm not sure how useful Camouflage will be though. It seems like it will be something you use in reaction to someone shooting you, and then break quickly to get the bonus damage before they can melee you. If they added a minor stealth effect with a cooldown it would be more interesting.</div></div><hr />

This.<br />
<br />
Also, I have no idea what are you people so excited about? Apart from the mana/focus change that is known to us since... Blizzcon, probably even before that (I hear that has been in wow beta) those new abilities are shit, changes, nothing really... Imo the worst preview by far from those we have seen. On the other hand I dont play a hunter and they are in pretty good place atm, one of the best PvE dpsers and in PvP... Well if you meet one, just try to run away :). If you dont bealive me just check some stream on xfire with one of those wrathful MM hunters :-X.</div></div><hr />

Ofc ... there will be no pvp for Hunters in Cata. Everything costs focus Concussive Shot, Disengage, Rapid Fire /lol. You have no chance to interact in pvp like with mana. This will be the end for the hunter ... all the more with that sucky regen for Focus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can I get off the same # of shots in X seconds using Focus, as I can right now using Mana.<br />
(cause right now there is nothing stopping me from chaining Serpent&gt;Chimera&gt;Aimed&gt;Arcane&gt;Steady Shot back to back as an opener)<br />
<br />
If the answer is NO, then add me to the list of people who hate the idea of changing to Focus as my resource.<br />
(unless they make each shot do more damage to equal out the burst I'd be losing)<br />
<br />
<br />
P.S. For people who cant' read well, Camo is not stealth. The way I read it is Camo is a ranged Deterence that lasts until you do damage or receive damage from either an AoE or a melee opponent hitting you.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sourika</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Source?<br />
<br />
If cooldowns on abilities are removed, and nothing else gets put in place then this will happen - (lets assume Chimera Shot is the most powerful attack).<br />
<br />
<br />
Serpent sting, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot<br />
<br />
<br />
So if they have removed cooldowns (although i can't see where they have said this), then a new system would need to be used to stop the hunter just spamming his hardest hitting attacks over and over and over again.<br />
<br />
<br />
Missing focus will stop them :D</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CzeroX</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guys seriously though, how can you all be happy with this? Some &quot;predator&quot; visual effect (to excite the kiddies of our class) with a blocking of ranged dmg when most of the issues we mainly have are actually against melee's. Not that anti-range dmg CD isnt good, but it isnt what i felt was needed more than help against melee's.<br />
<br />
We've seen absolutly nothing which will help us against melee's! You might say disengage/detterance, but come on, with disengage your death gripped back, your charged (now heroic leaped also!), rogues sprint at you, paladins stun you and walk back to you, theres just no end to it. Half the time in arena your jumping around on one spot trying your best to get any kind of range in order to get one or two shots off, while getting nuked to hell and half the time you cant do anything but watch cause of the melee range rubbish.<br />
<br />
Id rather they nerfed our damage but allowed us to shoot up close. But they seem to think running away is a fun thing for the class, when it is the most frustrating crap in the game. Any melee who knows his class well can totally stick on your ass for 90% of the time and its totally unfair. No matter how awesome the hunter is, there is a limit to how much you can keep them off you.<br />
<br />
PVE wise, which i do actually care more about, we see almost nothing new and interesting for the best specs. Ok so &quot;wow&quot; i now dont have to walk into trash for 2secs, woopie do, awesome....-.- Cause our trash DPS is reaaaaaaly important. Then a new shot to fix BM, ok one step in the right direction, MAYBE it will fix it, idk, maybe itll be a little more interesting, but still, it leaves the other two specs seeming compltly the same except for the fact its focus not mana.<br />
<br />
Oh and the mastery for BM is pet damage, but blizz always said they wanted to focus the damage away from the pets and more on the player....hmmmm ::)<br />
<br />
You guys say we got &quot;enough shots already&quot;, but who says it has to be a shot what we get which helps in those specs in PVE, theres so many other possible things they could of done, but nothing so far has been said to suggest anything else of worth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And when I need deterrence (BQL) same thing ?<br />
<br />
These abilities can't be on the same 100 focus resource base as our damage is, let's be serious.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrwingtipshoes</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 04:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">how much I know Hunters had Energy or focus in Alpha WoW or even Beta but playerbase asked to change it to mana so we are not changed but more like changed back.<br />
<br />
<br />
tho Concussive Shot/Tranquilizing Shot: 35 Focus.<br />
<br />
guess I will clearly refuse to dispell enrages now.. guess it will be Rogue duty now.<br />
<br />
<br />
And hopefully huntards with that attitude get benched because they have a poor attitude towards using their classes abilities. just like hunters and rogues that refuse to TotT and people who don't use threat dumps because &quot;i do what i want&quot; or &quot;Thats not my job&quot; for rogues to dispel enrages is them losing one of their poisons which is infact, at the moment, a bigger DPS lose. So instead of stroking your epeen to top the meters maybe you should do whats best for the raid?? just a thought since it is an MMORPG if you want to do just whats best for you maybe FF13 is more your speed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No true long time hunter is going to be disappointed by trap launcher or camouflage. We have been asking for both for a very long time.<br />
<br />
Yes the release of Cataclysm will be terrifying for our class. We along with Locks are having our class shaken up in ways the others cant imagine.<br />
<br />
I think hunters have had a bad road in general in WoW and I am one of the first to call out when we get shafted but this announcement is not one of those times.<br />
<br />
The class will work when Cata is shipped. It may disenfranchise hunters because it is so different and I may well be one of them. But it will be a working relevant class. And something tells me for every hunter who re-rolls another class will go hunter.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: We all need to remember that this is still pre BETA. Huge changes can and will likely still be made. Massive changes like the option to remove pets from Marks and gain damage can still be done. However that doesnt seem likely to me. I dont think Blizz wants to separate pets from hunters nor do I think they are going in the direction of adding more passive +damage buffs. They are getting rid of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT AGAIN: Removing melee abilities and adding in a base hunter pet when our character enters the world will both go a LONG way to helping the 'huntard' problem. When you roll your first character you dont know how to kite and before level 10 when you get your pet you shoot things once or twice and then you might as well be a warrior because it is on you and you are using mongoose bite.<br />
<br />
By giving hunters pets and removing melee abilities from the get go it will reinforce what we are and remove a massive built in mixed message.</div></div><hr />

I am hoping they keep some of the animal themed spells and abilities such as Aspects, but they have been compressing them for a bit now or they've just lost their general usefulness over time.</div></div><hr />

Yes i know in pvp you glyph it.<br />
<br />
Read on the list -<br />
<br />
&quot;Efficiency will reduce the Focus cost of Chimera Shot, Aimed Shot, and Arcane Shot.&quot; (This means the exact same gain you currently get from a glyph will be done in talented, and I also am aware that MM hunters in pvp atm already use it. With the 'boring talent' removal happening into mastery this means more people will be able to pick up efficiency to reduce the focus of Aimed shot anyway.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, the glyph will change - we'll see what to later down the line. Maybe it will further reduce the focus cost, or increase the dmg or w/e.<br />

Changes happen. Live with it.<br />

60 focus for aimed shot... with 6 focus per sec its 10 secs...<br />
So basicly you can only autoshot for 10 secs to be able to use aimed shot after 10 secs. Unless ofc you have time in pvp to spam those 2 sec steady shots...<br />
<br />
Also, why rapid fire etc costs focus while rogue cd's are free? hunters to this have 40% slower resource regeneration.<br />
<br />
If this values of focus and focus regen go life, its literally the end of hunters in pvp, unless aimed will take 50% of enemy life in 1 shot or simple autoshot will deal so much dmg that healers are going to have problems with healing it up...<br />
<br />
Seeing this i start to appriciate having mana...<br />
<br />
Also greatly disapointed by new skills. <br />
new version of steady shot and new version of freezing arrow... Gr8 2 new unique and exciting skills lol.<br />
And camouflage kind of sucks too. <br />
1 hunters already have 10 secs of imortality, now also camouflage?<br />
2 if camouflage is going to give its dmg increase right away its going to be macroed in pve, if its going to charge for a while for greater effect it makes it unreliable in pvp. In fact its unreliable anyway as long as dots exist and last time i checked pretty much every class has dots...<br />
<br />
Oh well, i guess its time to forget about playing hunter in cataclysm :(<br />
Can just hope that some1 will finally fire ghostcrawler <br />
<br />
<br />
Do people read? Like really did this poster ^^^^ read?<br />
<br />
<br />
Clearly hunter pvp is dead because hunters ALWAYS only regen 6fps. Steady/cobra shot doesnt regen mana at all. Rapid shot doesnt. They aren't giving you a version of tigers fury. no not at all its just 6focus per second and you have to deal with it. oh noes the sky is falling!<br />
<br />

Trap Launcher is basically.. an already exsisting skill.. but now for all traps.. I hope it doesn't mean this is an extra click but we'll see.. either way I wouldn't say this is a &quot;new&quot; skill more like an update of the current freezing shot.<br />
<br />
Camouflage seems quite interesting.. I'm just not quite sure as to how usefull it would be if you can just be AoEd out .. and it doesn't state if you're actually visible or not... more info please!<br />
<br />
no ammo is sweet.. but yeah.. wouldn't say it's a major change.. <br />
<br />
focus.. seems good but the numbers seem kind of meh.. <br />
with a focus regeneration rate of 6 per second.. I guess in PvE it's fine with steady and such.. in PvP however.. if you'd use Concussive, Aimed, Explosive (taken in account focus regeneration) in a row.. timed correctly with your focus regeneration (otherwise you'l have to wait a bit for the third skill you use in the row) means you'll be stuck with 0 focus.. and have to wait around 6 seconds to use something.. if you can't afford to use steady in between that is.. sorta feels like pressure a hunter so he can't stand around to use steady shot and he's pretty screwed with his focus..</div></div><hr />

If cooldowns on abilities are removed, and nothing else gets put in place then this will happen - (lets assume Chimera Shot is the most powerful attack).<br />
<br />
<br />
Serpent sting, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot, Chimera Shot<br />
<br />
<br />
So if they have removed cooldowns (although i can't see where they have said this), then a new system would need to be used to stop the hunter just spamming his hardest hitting attacks over and over and over again.<br />
<br />
Perhaps you should reread how focus works. The hunter doesn't have infinite focus, they can't just spam a big attack over and over and over again.</div></div><hr />

Clearly hunter pvp is dead because hunters ALWAYS only regen 6fps. Steady/cobra shot doesnt regen mana at all. Rapid shot doesnt. They aren't giving you a version of tigers fury. no not at all its just 6focus per second and you have to deal with it. oh noes the sky is falling!<br />

I love that people read half of a paragraph out of a 10 paragraph page, take time to make an account and post nerdrage all over the place. If most of the new posters in these threads had taken the time to read, then re-read the stuff on here they never would have had to make an account and post. instead they just make fools out of themselves and spew bile all over the place because they didnt read the whole thing or read it once and didnt comprehend or just dont want to understand because change is so scary.<br />

READ. PLEASE.<br />

Beta<br />
<br />
&quot;Beta&quot; is the software development phase following alpha, named after the Greek letter beta. It generally begins when the software is feature complete. The focus of beta testing is reducing impacts to users, often incorporating usability testing. The process of delivering a beta version to the users is called beta release.<br />
<br />
The users of a beta version are called beta testers. They are usually customers or prospective customers of the organization that develops the software, willing to test the software for free or for a reduced price.<br />
<br />
Beta version software is likely to be useful for internal demonstrations and previews to select customers. Some developers refer to this stage as a preview, a prototype, a technical preview (TP) or as an early access.<br />

Also it seems like you just gave our level 85 skill to people who pvp, making it just an excessive button for pve damage. <br />
<br />
Why don't you just bring back aimed shot instead of tweaking cast times for steady/cobra? I'm sure having a 3 second &quot;cast&quot; shot will be welcomed in this new rogue era. <br />

<br />
Well except it potentially lasts till whenever we want. And we can fire off burst damage and it breaks after. And the damage buff. <br />
<br />
<br />
1. standing in the massmob, planting immolation trap and then volley is dps, not explosive shot.<br />
<br />
2. it breaks when we deal or take damage, and taking damage is easy since every class has an aoe ranged skill to force us fighting on their rules again.</div></div><hr />

Explosive trap, immo is the single target one ... So he obviously meant to say explosive trap + trap launcher.<br />

<br />
1)Only genuine healers will be able to dispell Viper in Cata, and not all will.<br />
--- Only a few people will have the ability<br />
<br />
2)Dispells are going to be much more expensive to cast.<br />
--- Casting the dispell will no longer be a &quot;I have a free GCD, so I might as well do it&quot; no-brainer the way it is now.<br />
<br />
3)Dispells on targets that don't need a dispell are actually going to still fire off and cost the mana/GCD<br />
--- Since miscasting them will actually have a cost, people have to actually make a strategic decision on the casting.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wizzlecrank</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">As a Goblin Hunter in waiting, the lvl 1 pet change is much welcomed. I was having problems deciding which pet to use, I am curious what gobbies will start out with. So if I am reading the bit about ammo bags correctly, Hunters get a free 28 slotter basically? The WotLK ammo bag. Love the small stuff, with a personalized shot for BM looks like I know what I am going to roll.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chrysia</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I have REPEATEDLY seen people say focus is the end of hunter PVP because it'll force you to use aimed shot only ever 10 seconds. I have a question for you. Have you read aimed shot's tool tip lately? It has a cooldown, guess what that cooldown is? 10 goddamn seconds. It doesn't change this shot at all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">rainCZ</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cobra Shot (level 81): A new shot that deals Nature damage instead of Physical damage. This ability will share a cooldown with Steady Shot<br />
<br />
Since when Steady Shot has CD? And it's gonna be op as hell i bet</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bambooko</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Honestly I feel amazed with the reforging of Hunter resource into focus. Feels to me more like a competition and challenge for the player than a shackle-ball at the leg! I would love to learn to suit the Focus usage to appropriate conditions of an encounter like in the case of a Rogue. <br />
<br />
Also I find the new ability &quot;Cobra Shot&quot; to be appealing. Since this is only a preview in which many may change before the release date of &quot;Cataclysm&quot;, I still assume it will, compared to Steady Shot, do more damage to the target as the target has higher and higher number of Armour. <br />
<br />
Lastly, the controversial &quot;Camouflage&quot; does seem that its advantage will be very limited in PVP. Though, speculating from the official preview, the skill will prevent any form of single-target ranged damage, including either physical or magical, I might doubt people will start using more often area of effect spells to counter the defence. In Arena comptetitions it will be like that, though it may have a big impact on Battleground encounters. <br />
<br />
I only wonder how a camouflaged Hunter would look like... Surely he or she will not be invisible like a Rogue does! I quietly do wish to be able to partially blend with the background, partially visible. Not semi-transparent, but blend with the background. If I have a carrot field besides me, I want to see me holding a carrot-looking gun! (Carrot Sniper? ???) <br />
<br />
EDIT: BTW, let's discuss &quot;Trap Launcher&quot;. (yes, it is appealing to me again) Would the skill function like first I activate &quot;Trap Launcher&quot;, then I switch whichever trap I wish to use, but in this way the trap will not be laid like normal, instead a targeting scope will appear on the ground? <br />
<br />
And horray to removing the melee offensive skills! (but I guess Wing Clip will stay as it is now) They were only a burden in Talent trees.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you guys keep thinking these are how they are going to be when the expansion hits.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">emni</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I simply missed the part where Blizzard stated that some abilities would regen focus. (...)<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes. Yes you did.<br />
<br />
<br />
Steady Shot/Cobra Shot: No cost. Generates 9 Focus per shot (or 12 per second instead of 6).<br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I think the new spells and the changes look promising. Although, removing a spell that was one of the 3 new spells hunters got in Wrath and instead of replacing it putting trap launcher as a new 80+ Cata spell is a bit weird.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rokee</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reroll inc, after 5 years. I don't like the change at all.<br />
<br />
Neither do I.<br />
I'm still not convinced of the new Focus system. It's like playing a ranged rogue.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fritzeh</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">teh ranged rogue is incoming now! they even gave us stealth:D:D<br />
jokes aside, from reading it, it just feel wierd.. also feels like the skillcap for playing hunter pvp was raised a hell of a lot.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frostinferno</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not sure why people are so excited about Trap Launcher. Freezing arrow currently has a 28 second cd with pvp 4 set, meaning that using TL with freezing trap is actually a 32 second increase to the cd. The only real benefit to speak of is that frost trap can now be used at range (as far as pvp goes). Pretty disappointing that one our new skills is actually a trade off rather than a flat out gain. The pve benefits from this are also extremely minimal.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arandmoor</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ravagers: Will provide a debuff that will increase an enemy's Physical damage vulnerability (similar to a weaker version of the warrior ability Rampage).<br />
<br />
FAIL.<br />
<br />
That would be Blood Frenzy, chief.<br />
<br />
Sounds like some cool changes overall, though. Not having to constantly return to a stable just to change pets sounds nice. Oh yeah, and no more ammo, or mana.<br />
<br />
But please Hunters, don't QQ too hard about your preview. Just remember, you could be Warriors (i.e. having abilities nerfed in your preview).<br />
<br />
<br />
Um...Hunters DID have an ability nerfed in the warrior preview.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Herecius</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">jokes aside, from reading it, it just feel wierd.. also feels like the skillcap for playing hunter pvp was raised a hell of a lot.<br />
<br />
<br />
This for sure, also... hunter pvp (other than lolbeastcleave) was already a pretty intensely challenging experience. The change to focus is going to put a giant learning curve on the new system.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrwingtipshoes</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think focus is gonna change rotations *too* much.<br />
<br />
lol, blizz made hunter worse and they might want you begging them to reduce cd on this 60s ability back to 20 sec. No stealth. Really big changes.<br />
I did right decision leaving wow.<br />
<br />
<br />
Then why are you here? shoo.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shamslam</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At first I was a little concerned that many/most the new changes being announced are PVP oriented changes, but then I realized that they don't really need to give us more buttons to push on bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
For the love of god...QFT.<br />
<br />
You guys don't need 40 new spells every xpac. Be happy some classes aren't getting anything uber awesome, it means you're at least somewhat balanced. <br />
<br />
And really, wtf else could you ask for? Another dam button to press? This is why I hate the class preview, it's just another reason for some people to bitch and moan about how much &lt;class&gt; sucks</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilbet</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">i got a lvl 80 hunter i think its just going down hill from here... <br />
<br />
i think we should get buffs for not having our pet out say if your MM spec and you dont nessisarly need a pet exsept for AP buff. i think MM hunters should get like Proc pets such as DTK on the last boss where u some times get charged by a Rhino and stunned for 2 sec or what ever, we should get this for when we havnt got a pet out for example:<br />
Chanse on Hit:<br />
<br />
shadow Bear, Charge: stun for 2 sec and knock bk for 10 feet or whatever.<br />
shadow Cat Rend/rip : small Bleed effect<br />
Shadow snake thing: a week poisen<br />
these should be stackable but like have their own coodowns like each one can only happen every 20 sec and the all proc after using different amounts of focus etc just what i think anyway.<br />
<br />
like a pet that only does 1 attack but its a DoT or a stun. <br />
only for when you are petless, you get all pets kind off. <br />
this is what i think not sure about any 1 else but i shure wont b playing my main hunter ;\ very much anymore hehe QQ<br />
<br />
sorry for the typos kinda dislecsic &lt;&lt; as u can tell</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mrwingtipshoes</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I swear God I won't ever cast a Tranquilizing Shot in PvE in the whole Cataclysm<br />
<br />
<br />
Then hopefully the raid leaders are smart enough to sit you, because you are bad.<br />
<br />
People who do things only for their epeen or meter are bad and need to learn to work together as a team. Zomg i might go down in DPS if i use abilities that help everybody.<br />
<br />
If i want to top dps on my shaman i drop fire elemental.<br />
<br />
If i want the raid to do better dps overall then i drop Totem of wrath (raid sans demo lock and boomie)<br />
<br />
Guess what. bad players drop fire elemental. good players drop totem of wrath to help everyone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bluespirit</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">AMAZING!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrahkenKahn</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 05:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I've known about the change to focus since Blizzcon, but now seeing more details about it, and unbelievably, I feel even worse. If you're able to manage Aspect of the Cobra and Cobra Sting, even half decently, managing your mana shouldn't be a problem. But Aimed Shot taking SIXTY percent of your resources? Why ever use it again? That's like someone gives you a free gun, but then tells you it costs a hundred dollars for each bullet. There goes shot rotations right out the window. Oh you wanted to shoot Explosive Shot, then Aimed Shot? Tough. That goes from a mere 15% of your base mana to 105% of your focus. Hrm, well actually, you'd generate 6 focus during the global cooldown and be able to do it. But then you only have 1 focus left, which is worth jack squat. All I can say is that extra haste better improve focus regeneration ridiculous amount. Six a second isn't even going to remotely cut it.<br />
<br />
And while I'm happy for the removal of consumable ammo, I thought they'd said they were going to keep it as a static item like a relic. Like, you'd have a type of ammo that would add fire damage or something along those lines. That's a little bit of a disappointment. Ah well.<br />
<br />
And it's not really too big a problem, but why remove &quot;some melee abilities, such as Mongoose Bite&quot;? To discourage melee? What hunter is going out of their way to go into melee so they can use Mongoose Bite? What some? There are only three melee skills anyway. And one of those is designed to slow the enemy so we can away. No one is focusing on these, they're just backup tools. Why take that away?<br />
<br />
I'm Survival primarily, and I see my mastery is adding elemental damage to traps, Black Arrow, and Explosive Shot. Ummm... They already have that. Adding more I hope?<br />
<br />
The new skills are nice and, Cobra Shot aside, are actually pretty nifty. I know I've wanted to be able to use explosive trap from a distance for a long time. But are any of these real game changers? Probably not. Unless Camouflage makes you invisible like stealth, which it kind of sounds like it might. Then that's pretty awesome. I'm not getting my hopes up though. Is it a quasi-stealth where we're not quite invisible, just harder to see, like Cat/Spirit Beast pets' Prowl?<br />
<br />
The only thing I can stand up and cheer about without hesitation is the increased stable. I have three Spirit Beasts, which I put too much tome into finding to just abandon. That only leaves me two slots. One I have a Turtle for in case I need him to tank. And the other is the shadow saber skin Cat I tamed at level 15 and have had ever since. He's way too sentimental to just ditch either. Which means I'm stuck raiding with a Cat rather than the everyone-knows-it's-better Wolf. I realize that's my own fault due to my over sentimentality, but I know I'm not the only collector out there. Of course, this really isn't a huge improvement either. Or any improvement really in the case of people who don't need more than five pets. If you're going for straight dps, all you need is one pet and this change is blatant overkill.<br />
<br />
So yeah, not happy. But I'm also a whiny little baby.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure Fire Ele is better than ToW for the duration. Now if we are talking Magma/Searing, you have a point there.</div></div><hr />

Well, yeah. The point isn't to raise one pokemon to max level, but rather to raise them all equally before heading to the next gym so you have a better chance at beating the leader there.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sopne mesog</div><div class="date">2010-04-09, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hello everyone.<br />
<br />
Blizzard i'm sorry but you should remove this:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cobra Shot (level 81): A new shot that deals Nature damage instead of Physical damage. This ability will share a cooldown with Steady Shot. This will give hunters an alternative to Steady Shot on heavily-armored targets, and we will have talent incentives in the Beast Mastery tree to make this a signature shot. <br />
<br />
Trap Launcher (level 83): When used, the next trap can be shot to a location within 40 yards. This provides the current Freezing Arrow treatment to all traps and, as a result, we will be removing the current ability Freezing Arrow. 1-minute cooldown. No global cooldown.<br />
<br />
Camouflage (level 85): The hunter enters an obscured state that prevents him or her from taking ranged damage. The character would still be subject to melee or area-of-effect attacks, and dealing or taking damage will break the Camouflage effect. The hunter can move and set traps when under Camouflage, and will receive a damage bonus when attacking while under Camouflage (which will then break the effect).<br />
<br />
And let the players enjoy the Hunt:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Flame Barricade (level 81): A new shot that deals Fire damage and Physical damage. This ability will share a global cooldown but will also a debuff to the target.<br />
<br />
The target will burst in flames for a short period of time. Giving him Flame damage. (much like Bleed effect. The target cannot use steath)<br />
<br />
Trap Cannon (level 83): Shot 2 traps of the same element at the selected area (much like Freezing arrow but with 2 targets). Can be shot to a location within 40 yards. 1-minute cooldown. No global cooldown.<br />
<br />
Freezing arrow is removed from the game.<br />
<br />
Camouflage (level 85): The Hunter camouflage he or she plus the pet changing places wihout the enemy knowledge - The Hunter acquire his pet form while the pet acquire the masters form. The pet will continue to obey every command of its master's but will not abble to use any Hunter spell only auto attack the target.<br />
<br />
If the Hunter (master) use any attack it will break the camouflage and both master and pet will receive a 15s buff (name it) - giving +5% of critical chance. <br />
<br />
You're welcome.<br />

No i knew what you meant man, i think it is a cool idea. Like permanent shammy spirit wolves. Just when i read it i saw that... and i had to post it lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that if there would be the ability to have dual pets they couldnt be at full strength especially considering the buffs that BM has for their pets. That would be nuts, especially in pvp. The only pve worry i have is that i see enough stupid hunters in instances that dont know how to control one pet let alone two lol.</div></div><hr />
