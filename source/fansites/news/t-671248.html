Icecrown Citadel will feature a massive five-player dungeon sprawling across three wings of the citadel's foundation. While the Lich King's attention is focused on the Argent Crusade and the Knights of the Ebon Blade ripping through the front gates, players will be tested as they assist Jaina Proudmoore (Alliance) and Sylvanas Windrunner (Horde) in infiltrating the citadel through an alternate entrance.<br />
<br />
An epic quest line will present adventurers with the task of weakening Icecrown Citadel's forces, requiring that players defeat the challenges in each dungeon wing before venturing into the next one. Normal and Heroic versions of the dungeon will be accessible to players, although each wing will be considered a separate instance; therefore, on Heroic difficulty, each wing will have its own separate lockout timer. All-new rewards -- including item level 219 (normal) and level 232 (Heroic) loot -- will be offered to those who destroy some of the Lich King's most formidable allies.<br />
<br />
The Forge of Souls<br />
Serving as the first wing in this expansive dungeon, the Forge of Souls will quickly put players to the test of carving through the Scourge stronghold into deeper, more treacherous locations. Jaina will command Alliance forces, and Sylvanas will direct Horde forces. The goal is to ruin the twisted engines known as soul grinders found in this portion of the citadel, and then players can advance -- that is, if the Horde and Alliance forces can overcome the foes who confront them.<br />
<br />
Bosses<br />
Bronjahm, the Godfather of Souls: An instrument of reckoning, Bronjahm watches over the engines in the Forge of Souls. He must be killed if the soul grinders are to be destroyed.<br />
The Devourer of Souls: As the chief operator of the engines found in this wing, the Devourer stands guard over the souls stolen by the Lich King.<br />
<br />
Pit of Saron<br />
Accessible only to those who have laid waste to the Forge of Souls' unholy operations, the Pit of Saron will bring Horde and Alliance forces deeper into the Lich King's domain. Players who venture here will immediately be confronted by the lord of this lair, Scourgelord Tyrannus. But defeating him will not be as easy as it seems. Before they can present a threat to Tyrannus, the adventurers, instructed by their leaders, will need to free enslaved allies who have been trapped by the Scourge. Until that happens, Tyrannus will leave all adversaries to his minions, workers of the citadel's mines. Perhaps the challenges here will lend clues as to the whereabouts of the Lich King's private chambers outside of the Frozen Throne, deep within the Halls of Reflection.<br />
<br />
Bosses<br />
Forgemaster Garfrost: A master of Scourge weaponry, the forgemaster hauls stocks of saronite ore and other precious materials to the cold forges where the mechanisms of death are born. With a host of rime weapons and exotic alloys at his disposal, it could get cold in here.<br />
Krick and Ick: Zombies serve as mindless muscle in the Pit of Saron's mines, stockpiling metals for Forgemaster Garfrost, and Krick -- a devious leper gnome -- supervises the operations from atop Ick, Krick's ghastly means of transportation.<br />
Scourgelord Tyrannus: Tyrannus is a terrible force who will no doubt demonstrate his powers to those brave enough to enter the Pit of Saron. The scourgelord must die if players hope to make their way into the third and final wing of this dungeon.<br />
<br />
Halls of Reflection<br />
With Jaina and Sylvanas leading the way, adventurers who make it as far as these frigid halls will quickly recognize the weapon that lies ahead: Frostmourne, the corruptive, legendary device of the Lich King himself. The Lich King's private chambers are within reach, although they may be the death of anyone who ventures there.<br />
<br />
Bosses<br />
Falric and Marwyn: Captains for Arthas Menethil in life, Scourge commanders for the Lich King in death, Falric and Marwyn will be summoned to the Halls of Reflection for one purpose: destroying all intruders.<br />
The Lich King: Sylvanas, thirsty for vengeance against the corrupted prince who sentenced her to an existence as an undead monstrosity, and Jaina, eager to find a flicker of Arthas's soul locked somewhere within the Lich King, have brought their hand-picked allies to this final confrontation. Arthas's true power may only now be discovered. Is there any hope in this mission, or does only death await?<br />

You get to fight Arthas, however this doesn't involve a raid instance. You get to prove, that it's not the gear that matters to you, but the encounter. Well, here you go!<br />

I think this is an amazing middle ground. And I also like, that this is a proper 5-man with proper level of epicness with it. Hopefully it will take more time than just 30 minutes per wing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now my suggestions:<br />
1) High difficulty and hard boss strategies. Tuned for Full Epic lvl 80 Players with Lvl 200 Gear<br />
2) Teleporters that requires keys: you can enter the wing you want but you require the key for that wing<br />
3) Bosses drops Emblem of Triumph instead of Conquest<br />
4) Drops a mini-tier set, such as Dungeon Sets. This would really help new player to equip for The IC25.<br />
5) Questlines inside the dungeon, such as Quests to obtain keys for other wings (Kill the last boss of the wing, get Quest Rewards such as Epic Rings/Trinkets)<br />
<br />
Also, Arthas won't surely die, and I hope some epic scenes are in the dungeon, such as Arthas fleeing from the party, wounded.<br />
<br />
For the IC25 I'd say give to it 10, 25 modes and 10/25 hardmodes.<br />
Also for Tier 10: Only two sets.<br />
1) Tier 10, can be gotten in IC 10 Man/10 Hardmode.<br />
2) Tier 10.5, can be gotten in IC25/25HC.<br />
<br />
No Tier buyable with emblems, T9 can be farmed with Triumph easily, T10 is the last tier for WOTLK, please have it hard to get. And make it cool.</div></div><hr />

But I assume there will be a 25man raid eventually? I mean.. come one.. they can't make the final boss from the expansion 5 player only.. <br />

You either encounter him without Frostmourne or with a Jaina/Sylvannas Uberbuff or both. And only then are you able to barely best him, so he retreats but manages to retrieve Frostmourne and move to his more fortified and Uberbuff-immune throne room.<br />
<br />
You most definitely won't be killing him in the 5-man.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Jaina Proudmoore/Sylvanas Windrunner sounds interesting. I'd like to see this instance become proportionally as hard as Magister's Terrace was back in BC.

A refresh of weapons etc would be good as the last craftables were ilvl200. <br />
<br />
Really hoping for a craftable 1H tank weapon. I'll still run it to death regardless.<br />
<br />
As far as badges etc goes - a trophey from this would be pretty retarded. A triumph badge from the end boss of each wing and perhaps 1 from each boss in the wing? Getting 8 easy triumph badges a day would be kinda odd, every fool in the game would be walking around in T9 10man within a month. Don't get me wrong, i'm not the sort who whines at other people get my &quot;precious purple pixels&quot;, fully supported the move to conquest badges in 3.2 to allow folks some chance to catch up/gear alts (and I now sit with 2 characters able to clear toc25 man as a result) but there needs to be something to aim at for casuals gear wise, even if it's only to the point where they can show off in a pug. <br />
<br />
As it stands doing: toc10, toc25, ony 10 &amp; 25 and the daily heroic each day nets you around 50 badges per week. That's plenty enough to have most of the T9 gear and a couple of offset pieces. Those who aren't raiding shouldn't be QUITE so close to the leading pack. <br />
<br />
This would suddenly open the rapid gear up in tier to everyone for little effort. Even if the relative difficulty is MgT (omg, we have to use CC and line of sight on pulls again?!) it's probably still going to make things a little too open.<br />
<br />
I guess we shall see, i'll likely not complain at the time and just gear my alt tank further.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell they could even include it in the raid itself, the raid comes along and sees Arthas doing battle with 5 friendlies downstairs, and the raid and fordring shout something and arthas actually flees from them not us. Since he already weakened from the fight with us and whatever Jaina/Sylvanas did to him, and doesnt want to face fordring and more of us yet, and he runs.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you'll really get to fight him. Come on, he's way, way too powerful for a 5man party and a strong NPC hero. I'm getting ''Oh, that tickled&quot; images here. <br />
We know you'll get to fight him in the raid, and in that encounter a bunch of hero NPCs are going to fight along with you (as was more or less confirmed, IIRC), so five people and one hero isn't going to cut it, guys.</div></div><hr />

That would be good for a change. Maybe the LK should not really be killed on the first try instaid the instance should end up with the party been killed until you <br />
&quot;build up&quot; some resistance to his final attack or something like that.<br />

I hope it's more like you fight him down to a %, and it ends in an ability/cut scene. This being, he fucks your whole group up, hardcore. You all die, or get snared/stunned, whatever - and Jaina/Sylvanis takes a hit to the face. They either die, or he kidnaps them, having already dealt with your 5 man, he leaves, not flees. <br />

Uh... didn't you complete the questline with the amazing cutscene? The Wrathgate? After Putress unleashed that plague killing Saurfang and Fordragon, Arthas was incredibly weakened and retreated into the Citidel.<br />
<br />
Having rehashed this myself, it's quite possible the Arthas that is fought in the 5-man is still weakened by this event. He didn't have Frostmourne then, and it's likely he will not in the 5-man either. Anything is possible, but I really find Jaina and/or Sylvannas dying in this encounter unlikely. In fact, I'm willing to bet they will be the only thing that keeps the Lich King from completely annihilating the 5-man groups.</div></div><hr />

Hardcores have heroic mode , that is what blizz wanted and even if some are still living in vanilla when u could brag with a full t2 set and a newbie would bow in your face , now, every1 can get to feel what is like to face Arthas .<br />
What i do not like is to see those crappy players who just started playing , lvled up , got epics but not enchanted , weird sockets and weird specs thinking they are the best there ever was , anyway u can inspect em and kick em even from a 5 man run so no biggie but why are u complaining that even ppl with jobs and kids at home can spend 2-3 h / day and still get decent gear , see Arthas , maybe even kill him in a 10 man normal , enjoy the game without raiding 5 h / night and farming 2h/day to keep up with raids ? <br />
I for one LOVE what blizz is doing to the game cause once i too had the time to raid endgame and get realm firsts but now stuff changed and i cant anymore but i still want to log on and see what happened to the game and actualy be able to join a raid with my gear still pretty close to theirs , otherwise id just be left alone with obsolete gear and no1 would take u anywhere , i mean dont u think its a shame to make instances for just a couple of ppl ( im talking % here) to see?

Agree, it would be lame if a 5man grp of &quot;random heroes&quot; managed to weaken Arthas enough to make him escape, hopefully he will just &quot;play with us&quot; and after we have dealt 1mill dmg to him, he will freeze us in iceblocks/instant kill spell, and then run away (ofc we will get ressed by Tirion and his gangbang paladins as usually). The fact that the LK didnt even put up a fight against Tirion at Light's Hope Chapel and just teleported away, would make it look extemely silly if he just ran away like that a 2nd time</div></div><hr />

Having rehashed this myself, it's quite possible the Arthas that is fought in the 5-man is still weakened by this event. He didn't have Frostmourne then, and it's likely he will not in the 5-man either. Anything is possible, but I really find Jaina and/or Sylvannas dying in this encounter. In fact, I'm willing to bet they will be the only thing that keeps the Lich King from completely annihilating the 5-man groups.<br />
<br />
News Flash !!!!!one one eleven , Saurfang did not die :)</div></div><hr />

Seriously?<br />
How about you get over yourself?<br />
OH NO people have gear with as high an ilvl as me! Whatever will I DO???!!!<br />
It's terrible that someone newly 80, maybe on alt, doesn't have to grind through tons of heroics, naxx, ulduar, etc to get good gear. <br />
It's terrible that someone might be able to gear up so fast they could become a contributing member of a raiding guild in no time flat.<br />
And if it's terrible players getting good gear, then it's terrible players in good gear, they still suck, only now it's even more apparent. Tell me again how this affects you at all?<br />

And I wouldn't be too worried about the ilvl of the gear, in my experience those people who have the &quot;horrific specs&quot; and so on that I think someone said earlier will still suck.

Another raid where you fight 5-7 min then everyone has to take a 10 min break cause x needs to eat something y needs to feed the cat is a bad idea.<br />

Actually, I kinda agree that it'd be nice to have a &quot;final&quot; boss in a lower form. I know we have 10/25 mans, but maybe for once, we should see a conclusion in a much more popular form, i.e. the 5 man. With 3.2 as it was, and how 3.3 is shaping upto be, it's obvious Blizzard want us to see Icecrown Citadel. None of this &quot;casual friendly&quot; bullshit, just maybe Blizzard doing some service to its players. Arthas has been, well, one of (if not THE) major lore figure since Warcraft 3, and Blizzard seem to want as many people as possible to face him in Icecrown. His presence throughout Northrend decreased (although he did crop up in zones like Zul'drak and Grizzly Hills) as you got nearer to Icecrown, and as such, I think it was hinted that he's busier and busier with Icecrown Citadel itself.</div></div><hr />

It's not because it's a 5man, that it should be &quot;roflstomped&quot; at 1st sight. Common, there are no more excuses for &quot;hey, i'm still in questing green/blues&quot; anymore, we all have enough gear (or easy way to obtain said gear, *cof* ToChamp *cof* Conquest *cof*) so the final part of the game and currently LORE of the world could be challenging. No need to carry the players on blizzard's arms to the safety of the good gear so they &quot;can finally play&quot;.<br />
<br />
We're not running trough Utgard Keep or inside Tirion's little park, we're inside the damned Icecrown Citadel, that should not be a nice and cute place with stupid mobs to do a picnic. After all, they should need to be good to be inside the Citadel instead of wandering around northrend, otherwise I'm would start to think that the Lich King is kind of... well... noob :)<br />
<br />
The ilvl puzzles me... 219 and 232? Old H-5mans = 200, ToC N/H = 200/219 (219=Uld10), but 3.3 N/H = 219/232??? Would expect 226/232 or even 219/226...<br />
<br />
well, blizzard stated that they did the mistake of increasing the ilvl more than they should anyways... and since &quot;Uld10 = 219&quot; goes for H-ToC, then the logic says &quot;ToC10 = 232&quot; goes for 3.3 H-5man...<br />
<br />
The IC10/25 ilvl will be really stupid... lol</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fierydemise</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Really ToC and the ICC 5 mans seem to be Blizz's way of solving the gear gap issue. Throughout wrath it seems like they've been trying really hard to figure out a answer to the problem that if you miss the raiding boat early it can be very difficult to get on later. These progressively higher reward 5 mans seem to be a really cool way to do that. These 5 mans would allow a player to get within 1 tier of the current progression tier and if they are tuned properly (for ilevel 213+ players) they offer a real sense of progression even for people who aren't raiding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It most certainly isn't disgusting.<br />
<br />
Casual players have Naxx. Sartharion. Malygos. Ulduar. Onyxia. VOA. And Trial of the Crusader all gift wrapped and ready for them.<br />
<br />
So all Icecrown should be on the same level as all those, in the current state of the game? (average ilevels, etc.)<br />
<br />
No. No it should not.<br />
This is an MMO, not a single player rpg.<br />
You play MMOs over a longer period of time than any single player game could offer.<br />
Icecrown Citadel is the coup de grâce of WOTLK raids.<br />
I'm sorry you self-entitled whiners only have x hours a week to play. <br />
Icecrown Citadel is the last raid of the expansion. This is an MMO.<br />
Your constant cries for all content's accessibility (including the last and most 'epic' raid of the expansion) to be based on your available playtime per week is a goddamn joke.<br />
<br />
But putting the endgame of endgame raid for the current expansion on the same difficulty level as the rest of the piss-poor easy (non heroic/hard mode) raids?<br />
That's just absolutely retarded.<br />
I'm sure it will happen, which will be a real disappointment.<br />
Not because of the casual playerbase's pathetic argument of epeen (awful word btw), showing off shiny purples, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Everyone should have access to raids and equipment. Almost all parties involved in WoW now agree.<br />
<br />
But the casual playerbase continues to lack the understanding that there needs to be a goddamn CURVE.<br />
<br />
A curve that is based first and foremost on your GEAR.<br />
<br />
You take away such a curve, and you further the destruction of a persistent world with a endgame progression.<br />
<br />
Why can't you people understand this?<br />
It's not about showing off. But that is a plus. It should be.<br />
If the difference between player's gear didn't matter, then gear should be removed from the game.<br />
Oh look. You take away gear, there isn't a progression curve left.<br />
As now all raids are tuned to be immediately accessible once players hit maximum level.<br />
We don't gain stats once we reach max level.<br />
There aren't attunements to put raids in any order of progression.<br />
<br />
So with that in mind. If we took the FINAL and PENULTIMATE raid(and it's very high ilevel instance hub) in this expansion and handed it out on the same silver platter as all other raids/instances.. then wow... how utterly embarrassing.<br />
<br />
Gear progression is already a pretty laughable experience in the current game.<br />
3.2 made sure of that. Now everyone has a very easy way to gear up and be on par with everyone else.<br />
<br />
Such a process has absolutely no reason to repeat itself in 3.3</div></div><hr />

By that do you mean.. as mindnumbingly easy as ToC is? I hope not =/ <br />
<br />
Also: If you're a hardcore raider ( I imagine most of the people whining about 232 loot aren't ) .. why do you even care? I mean, RIGHT NOW, ilevel 232 loot is two tiers below the top level of gear... at icecrown level it'd be a full four tiers under the top.... <br />
<br />
Actually it's right on par with how ToCh relates with ToCr, and how 3.0 heroics related to Naxx...... Ohnoes! 5 mans are scaling too! QQ.<br />

Why do you think H-Halls of Reflection is going to have the same gear requirement as Heroic halls of lightning? .. Better yet, why does allowing 5 man instances to scale just like everything else in the game does somehow ruin your experience?</div></div><hr />

Heck when 3.3 launches hardcore raiders will have 258 gear on most slots (with a few 245 items when upgrade is not available or to keep 4set bonus up). This is two tiers above what the instance will drop. I don't see what is wrong with that place dropping good gear, just make it an interesting instance for once (something like prenerf classic Strat/Scholo?

The gear is there to help the content progression, not to be e-peen trophies.<br />

<br />
Very good sentiment.<br />
<br />
I admit, I was a hardcore 40man raider in WoW Classic and had Full Tier 2 before Naxxramas. I do miss the days where if you had gear people would just randomly send you tells like &quot;oh man nice gear&quot;. Back then, there was a massive disconnect between the population in the game. Now, things are different. There are a ton more resources online, more collaboration, more strats, and more educated players. I like how things are now and am glad for it, even if I do miss the old days some time. My $15/mo isn't worth any more or less than anybody elses, and the game caters to a ton of players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't get it. They don't want the curve to be extremely difficult.<br />
<br />
They want it to be just difficult enough that they can do it, and nobody else. That way they get to lord over all the little peons and claim superiority.<br />
<br />
Look at the bitching that goes on when they can't complete something because it's too difficult. The only difference between their QQ and the QQ from everybody else is the names of the places and bosses. They want what everybody else wants.<br />
<br />
They're just pissed when other people get to have it too.<br />
<br />
The mentality reminds me of that kid we all knew who would get pissed off at other children's birthday parties because there were no presents for him, but god forbid you recieved any kind of special treatment at his party.<br />
<br />
Honestly. The difficulty curve is what hard mode is for. Just admit it works and let me get my damn tier gear and progress in normal. You'll still have achievements I'll never get to see, but at least I'll get to kill all the bosses too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casual players have Naxx. Sartharion. Malygos. Ulduar. Onyxia. VOA. And Trial of the Crusader all gift wrapped and ready for them.<br />
<br />
So all Icecrown should be on the same level as all those, in the current state of the game? (average ilevels, etc.)<br />
<br />
No. No it should not.<br />
This is an MMO, not a single player rpg.<br />
You play MMOs over a longer period of time than any single player game could offer.<br />
Icecrown Citadel is the coup de grâce of WOTLK raids.<br />
I'm sorry you self-entitled whiners only have x hours a week to play. <br />
Icecrown Citadel is the last raid of the expansion. This is an MMO.<br />
Your constant cries for all content's accessibility (including the last and most 'epic' raid of the expansion) to be based on your available playtime per week is a goddamn joke.<br />
<br />
But putting the endgame of endgame raid for the current expansion on the same difficulty level as the rest of the piss-poor easy (non heroic/hard mode) raids?<br />
That's just absolutely retarded.<br />
I'm sure it will happen, which will be a real disappointment.<br />
Not because of the casual playerbase's pathetic argument of epeen (awful word btw), showing off shiny purples, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Everyone should have access to raids and equipment. Almost all parties involved in WoW now agree.<br />
<br />
But the casual playerbase continues to lack the understanding that there needs to be a goddamn CURVE.<br />
<br />
A curve that is based first and foremost on your GEAR.<br />
<br />
You take away such a curve, and you further the destruction of a persistent world with a endgame progression.<br />
<br />
Why can't you people understand this?<br />
It's not about showing off. But that is a plus. It should be.<br />
If the difference between player's gear didn't matter, then gear should be removed from the game.<br />
Oh look. You take away gear, there isn't a progression curve left.<br />
As now all raids are tuned to be immediately accessible once players hit maximum level.<br />
We don't gain stats once we reach max level.<br />
There aren't attunements to put raids in any order of progression.<br />
<br />
So with that in mind. If we took the FINAL and PENULTIMATE raid(and it's very high ilevel instance hub) in this expansion and handed it out on the same silver platter as all other raids/instances.. then wow... how utterly embarrassing.<br />
<br />
Gear progression is already a pretty laughable experience in the current game.<br />
3.2 made sure of that. Now everyone has a very easy way to gear up and be on par with everyone else.<br />
<br />
Such a process has absolutely no reason to repeat itself in 3.3<br />
<br />
<br />
Quoted again for the truth. <br />
<br />
If we cant have everything we want, at least give us a dungeon like Black Temple. BT had a very very obvious curve once you got past supremus/akama that let lesser guilds (casual guilds included i suppose) experience the raid yet left the meat of it to be enjoyed by those that... wait for it... were SKILLED enough and really WANTED to put in the hard work to do it. <br />
<br />
Having a dungeon for those of us that really ENJOY raiding and dont just show up for free epics is so incredibly fun. Honestly id also say that its more beneficial to the game in a way, If you give everyone access to everything its going to end up leading to boredom with people having less to work towards when it comes to raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To comment on the two things im sure that will be brought up, Sunwell was very fun for those of us who enjoy raiding yet coming from someone who completed it i would agree it may be a little too extreme to be reproduced exactly. I always thought they should create a dungeon along the lines of ulduar with not just one hard boss off to the side (algalon) but an entire wing (copy and paste sunwell in here) for top end raiders to go and enjoy. This however takes me to my next comment...<br />
<br />
<br />
Hard modes are a cop out. Ive completed every hard mode to date minus Anub and i can honestly say i despise them. Having actual original bosses who have one level of difficulty that is on par with a &quot;hard mode&quot; is infinitely more fun than this method. Im all for casuals and lesser guilds having access to bosses but when the hardest fights of a raid are the exact same bosses simply with new abilities it brings a whole new level of boredom to raids. ToC is an extreme version of this, fighting the exact same boss in the exact same room four times a week is by far the most unenjoyable thing ive done in this game yet.<br />
<br />
I guess all im asking for is for &quot;hard modes&quot; to be entirely different bosses in different areas of the raid, give us something different and original.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and the 5 man should definately end with Arthas demolishing us, not him retreating.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Facedesk</div><div class="date">2009-09-30, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously, are we still dealing with them casual-haters? <br />
<br />
Hardcore raiders will have their 25-man hardmode, casuals will have 10-man normal and perhaps 25-man normal.<br />
This is probably how it'll work from now on, so get used to it or unsubscribe. If you don't like the game no more, why do you even play? Find some other game if this doesn't suit ya, it's that simple :)<br />
<br />
Endgame is now for pretty much anyone. But you hardcores will still have slightly better and more shiny epics, cooler mounts and haxx achievements to feel proud about ^^<br />
<br />
Remember, casual doesn't mean terrible.<br />
<br />
OT: Would be interesting having us flee from the lich king instead of the other way around. I mean, we've seen enough of &quot;HURR HURR, IM LOW NOW SO IMMA TAKE OFF CYA IN MAH RAID OH BTW HAF SUM LOOT!&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh and also. I sure hope this will be a difficult five man. I mean, i do want people to complete it, but not just faceroll right through everything. Just because it's five man it does not have to be equal to free loot. It would be tons of fun if it took some thinking :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You guys like to cry about &quot;casual haters&quot; yet all i see is people like you, people who cry and yell at people who enjoy NOT facerolling content. This comment is so wrong i dont know where to start.<br />
<br />
No one slams their dick in a door, much less for 5 hours a night.<br />
&quot;Hardcore raiders&quot; and &quot;Top end raiders&quot; are completely different in every way imaginable.<br />
<br />
Old raiding was fun raiding, you should be sad its never coming back. I really cant see why 1shotting everything is fun, the joy of raiding comes from working hard to overcome a difficult boss. To you that may be boring and slamming your dick, but to us we see progression and enjoy a challenge.<br />
<br />
Maybe its just a product of the age we live in now, video games are so mainstream and the world is all about making things easy. No one appreciates a challenge anymore.<br />

<br />
Edit: clarifying this for the trolls.<br />
<br />
Hardcore Raiders = Ensidia and the like, people who will play for obscene amounts of time to be the best in the world. Yes, this is a little crazy, but if they enjoy doing it who are we to talk bad about it? This type of player accounts for what, a handful of guilds worldwide? Acting like this is how we all raid is ignorant on your part.<br />
<br />
Top end Raiders = People who are skilled and raid normal times throughout the week. These are the guilds getting server firsts and clearing hard modes. The players in these guilds are players who ENJOY raiding, they dont raid for phat epicz, they raid because its what they like to do. Contrary to what you believe in, these players also have lives while managing to raid normal (sometimes even less than the lower tier guilds) times during the week.</div></div><hr />

It's not about showing off. But that is a plus. It should be.<br />
If the difference between player's gear didn't matter, then gear should be removed from the game.<br />
Oh look. You take away gear, there isn't a progression curve left.<br />
As now all raids are tuned to be immediately accessible once players hit maximum level.<br />
We don't gain stats once we reach max level.<br />
There aren't attunements to put raids in any order of progression.<br />
<br />
So with that in mind. If we took the FINAL and PENULTIMATE raid(and it's very high ilevel instance hub) in this expansion and handed it out on the same silver platter as all other raids/instances.. then wow... how utterly embarrassing.<br />
<br />
Gear progression is already a pretty laughable experience in the current game.<br />
3.2 made sure of that. Now everyone has a very easy way to gear up and be on par with everyone else.<br />
<br />
Such a process has absolutely no reason to repeat itself in 3.3<br />
<br />
<br />
In my personal opinion, Naxxramas and Ulduar ARE NOT casual raids. I am not saying that they are hard raids, but the time it takes to complete the raid makes them not casual. On a &quot;casual&quot; schedule, I cannot fit naxx or ulduar in my schedule. As someone stated earlier, casual != difficult. Casual via low playtime / week is really only dependent on time it takes for the instance. I used to raid a ton, but I can't anymore. I appreciate hard raids (I'd appreciate them more if my computer didn't suck, but I'm not blaming anyone but myself for that). I think that yes a curve should be based on gear, but people who have to take breaks from wow (oh god, the heresy), should be given an opportunity to catch up. I personally have fallen behind my guild due to a my schedule and I think the options that IC-5mans can bring would be nice to help me catch up to other guild members.<br />
In synthesis: Do people not deserve good gear because they fell behind or have a casual schedule. I don't think so. Should they be given equal gear? No, I don't think so. Casual raids are not necessarily easy raids. Casual does not equal a bad player, but a player who can not, or will not, devote large amounts of time to honing their character.<br />
Flame me if you want, I don't care. I am Valaraukador of Korgath, feel free to say whatever you want. I will only respond to intelligent debate / discussion.<br />
<br />
Edit: By the way, final and penultimate do not mean the same thing, they are contradictory...<br />
Edit2: Also, someone brought up the point that some guilds can raid and spend less time then &quot;non-hardcore&quot; guilds. That is a good point, and I agree with that point, and that in some cases &quot;raid time&quot; is just an excuse for casuals.</div></div><hr />

Ok, fair enough. FYI I have raiding both &quot;hardcore&quot; and &quot;casual&quot; during LK. I was in my guild's first kill of Sarth+3D.(I doubt you care and will scoff regardless) I'll admit it wasn't the hardest of encounters but it was a challenge regardless. I must say from the hardcore aspect, I was disappointed by the content's difficulty, but then they implemented hard modes and heroic mode, etc. From a casual aspect the game just isn't interesting as it was from a hardcore aspect, and making raid content more available makes the game more interesting for me. I am not &quot;shit&quot; as you say, but I'm sure anything I say won't change that. Perhaps you didn't get the message when I posted this earlier, so I'm going to make this a little clearer for you.<br />

<br />
WELL WOULDN'T IT BE COOL, if for a change, instead of killing the Lich King or inflicting a mere setback, we instead watch as Arthas wins? This is just 5 players and he is the Lich King..... maybe he kills jaina and sylvannas? Maybe he levels some base because we the players fail? Maybe our plan throughout the dungeon utterly fails and because of this we have extra obstacles in the raid somehow? <br />
<br />
Something needs to happen to bring Arthas back to epic. Im tired of absolutely bitch-slapping him and his minions at every turn. I'm sure they can work loot into it somewhere. <br />

<br />
At the moment I have together with my guild just reached 25 ToC hc (still on beasts) but we are getting there.<br />
What I have read in the blizz post and in some of the comments here does make sense I mean the majority of players (biggest revenue source for Blizz) wants and should see as much of the content as possible and lets be honest with the way it is now they can.<br />
However the below comment I found on page 10 of this subject is in my opinion also very very true<br />
<br />
Hard modes are a cop out. Ive completed every hard mode to date minus Anub and i can honestly say i despise them. Having actual original bosses who have one level of difficulty that is on par with a &quot;hard mode&quot; is infinitely more fun than this method. Im all for casuals and lesser guilds having access to bosses but when the hardest fights of a raid are the exact same bosses simply with new abilities it brings a whole new level of boredom to raids. ToC is an extreme version of this, fighting the exact same boss in the exact same room four times a week is by far the most unenjoyable thing ive done in this game yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casual players have Naxx. Sartharion. Malygos. Ulduar. Onyxia. VOA. And Trial of the Crusader all gift wrapped and ready for them.<br />
<br />
So all Icecrown should be on the same level as all those, in the current state of the game? (average ilevels, etc.)<br />
<br />
No. No it should not.<br />
This is an MMO, not a single player rpg.<br />
You play MMOs over a longer period of time than any single player game could offer.<br />
Icecrown Citadel is the coup de grâce of WOTLK raids.<br />
I'm sorry you self-entitled whiners only have x hours a week to play. <br />
Icecrown Citadel is the last raid of the expansion. This is an MMO.<br />
Your constant cries for all content's accessibility (including the last and most 'epic' raid of the expansion) to be based on your available playtime per week is a goddamn joke.<br />
<br />
But putting the endgame of endgame raid for the current expansion on the same difficulty level as the rest of the piss-poor easy (non heroic/hard mode) raids?<br />
That's just absolutely retarded.<br />
I'm sure it will happen, which will be a real disappointment.<br />
Not because of the casual playerbase's pathetic argument of epeen (awful word btw), showing off shiny purples, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Everyone should have access to raids and equipment. Almost all parties involved in WoW now agree.<br />
<br />
But the casual playerbase continues to lack the understanding that there needs to be a goddamn CURVE.<br />
<br />
A curve that is based first and foremost on your GEAR.<br />
<br />
You take away such a curve, and you further the destruction of a persistent world with a endgame progression.<br />
<br />
Why can't you people understand this?<br />
It's not about showing off. But that is a plus. It should be.<br />
If the difference between player's gear didn't matter, then gear should be removed from the game.<br />
Oh look. You take away gear, there isn't a progression curve left.<br />
As now all raids are tuned to be immediately accessible once players hit maximum level.<br />

I swear I couldn't have put it better myself. Hopefully Blizzard will make it almost as hard as SWP. The only reason I say almost as hard is cause they said they would never tune a raid to that degree again as it was way too harsh, which I do not agree with, it was perfectly attuned. Hopefully, Blizzard will pull their heads out of their arses and realize that they have a MMO and if it wants to survive like the rest of them, it will increase the difficulty of its raids to what it once was. No other MMO caters to Casuals like WoW and they(Other MMOs) have strived because of it. Regardless of whether it is easy or hard, casuals will continue to play this game, however the hardcore will leave if it is not challenging. So lets hope Icecrown Citadel Raid is what it should be, and hopefully all of Cataclysm as well.</div></div><hr />

I agree that content needs to be harder... but shouldn't casuals get a chance too? They all pay the same amount you do to not experience the whole game.<br />
<br />
Edit: The only way to solve this casual vs. hardcore thing is to make raiders pay a different rate so that casuals get to experience &quot;all they pay for&quot; but in turn hardcore players have to pay the price if they want hard raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not the wand, it's the wizard.<br />
<br />
You will still have much better gear come 3.3 if you raid, just the same as you probably have better gear right now then most casuals. The simply fact *is* (using the word you dislike) your epeen simply can't accept that they are both purple and shiny. The welfare gear allows us to make the small jump over less-used content, especially when/if the causal came into the game later then everyone else. This is important because, and be honest, are you going to go back and help them out?!? You see it was easier for you because everyone was doing the content back then, but almost no one wants to now, but again epeen dictates everyone should have to do it the hard way.<br />
<br />
This *is* the new WoW, there will be various levels of gear for everyone, content for everyone to see and hard-modes for the raiders to flex about... accept it or gtfo.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank You, Mr. Casual for being a hypocrite. The casual player base has stated many times that it is about seeing the content that the Hardcore players can, not the gear. However those of us that do raid, know this is just a lie. It is all about gear to you and to most of the hardcore base. For a few people it is about seeing the encounter like myself. I can't tell you how many times I have passed on gear to other guildies cause I don't care that much about it and it makes them happy. For me, it is about the content. And if that is so fine, you have 10 mans that require less time, however they should be properly tuned to be just as difficult as a 25 man, and the 25 mans should be retuned back to the difficulty that they should be. What us hardcore players want is for the difficulty to increase and not for it to be so easy, if it can cater to your schedule of playing 2 hours a week in a 5 man instance then so be it, but it should be the proper difficulty and not some cakewalk, which this game has become. However, as it has been stated, every casual wants their gear handed to them on a silver platter. Since like you said its about gear, well you have it, its called ToC. For those interested in the content then play for it like it should be made. Arthas is a powerful foe in the game, and he should be made that way. Hopefully, Blizzard won't screw up Icecrown for the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

Run the raids naked and you will have a challenge... The rest of what you say is bullshit.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can not create challenge in their game any longer. Simply because if they would - then it would be easily beatable by certain setup.. while making it absolutly impossible for another. 1 tank - 1 healer - 3 dps... Go on and realise that Blizzard has ignored the 5 man balance for the entire WOTLK and just like with Sunwell - they are throwing out something that will alienate alot of players - JUST because they are not playing the right class...</div></div><hr />

<br />
That why Blizz brought into the game the heroic raid mode. Yes, it was bad implemented (finishing normal for the heroic attunement + 5 weeks until all bosses opening = teh boring), but the idea is good and it works. That's what Blizz needs to establish once and for all, 5-man normal and heroic, 10-man normal and heroic and 25-man normal and heroic, with the gear progression following this.</div></div><hr />

Its not the content that gets harder .... its the gear that gets better... <br />
<br />
25 man teams are beating 10 man content without looking at the screen.. cause they are ALREADY wearing the full set of gear lvl for that instance. And that is BEFORE they start doing the same version of the 25 man instance...<br />

<br />
Edit: clarifying this for the trolls.<br />
<br />
Hardcore Raiders = Ensidia and the like, people who will play for obscene amounts of time to be the best in the world. Yes, this is a little crazy, but if they enjoy doing it who are we to talk bad about it? This type of player accounts for what, a handful of guilds worldwide? Acting like this is how we all raid is ignorant on your part.<br />
<br />
Top end Raiders = People who are skilled and raid normal times throughout the week. These are the guilds getting server firsts and clearing hard modes. The players in these guilds are players who ENJOY raiding, they dont raid for phat epicz, they raid because its what they like to do. Contrary to what you believe in, these players also have lives while managing to raid normal (sometimes even less than the lower tier guilds) times during the week.<br />
<br />
Thank God, someone has clarified this for them. The guild I lead raids 4 nights a week for about 3-4 hours a night, we take 1 break in the middle. We all have lives. Hell I work 30 hours of week and go to College for another 22, spend the weekends with my girlfriend, and run a guild. We enjoy raiding for the challenge and want to clear the content. Guilds like Ensidia on the other hand can be a bit extreme as they are going for world first kills. Please Blizzard bring the challenge back into this game or it will DIE!<br />
<br />
One more thing lets have a sort of analogy of sorts...<br />

If you, a casual player, walked into a 5 man instance, hit it with an attack and it fell over with epic loot, would you still find it challenging? No. Well thats how we feel with the current content. Example, Black Temple, wasn't that hard, if you know how to play your class to a point and have 24 other people that can too, unfortunately a majority of the player base doesn't understand the basics of their classes.</div></div><hr />

The challenge IS there. It's called heroic raid mode. If you are not doing it, then it's not Blizz's fault.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's 3 dungeons. You only need to do the 2 first dungeons one time.</div></div><hr />

still its better then every other heroic/raid/dungeon/heroic raid on the game right now, we actually have to DO something other then &quot;LFM H FH 2m DPS and Tank&quot; and just steamroll 8 bosses for free loot thats ilevel 232.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Instead of &quot;LFM H FH 2m DPS and Tank&quot;, you'll get &quot;LFM H FH (You can ENTER) 2m DPS and Tank&quot;.<br />
<br />
If it's easy as fck as all other 5mans, it's gonna be no problem pugging it at all, even if people have to do two others first.<br />
<br />
It's like Arcatraz in TBC. Was Arcatraz epic because you had to do Mechanar and Botanica first? No it really wasn't..<br />
<br />
Now if it requires to do the other two first every time, it might be interesting. But depends on length of the instance and difficulty as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is fine with almost all top end raiding guilds! THAT IS WHAT WE WANT. Something that requires you to be good at the game, but still be accessible by others. Fine, you can only do three hours a night, over 3 nights. However, if you are good, you should be able to do it! Good players want a challenging encounter, and the ones that are challenging don't take an hour to clear each. Most encounters last 10 minutes or less except maybe end of raid bosses which go to about 20 minutes. I mean ToC 10m takes an hour if you have skilled people that don't fail at the game(which most of the people do), if you can't commit an hour or two during a WEEK to clear a raid, then you shouldn't be able to do the content.<br />
<br />
Maybe we should rephrase casual... Casual being people with little play time... And people without skill being &quot;Failures.&quot;<br />
<br />
So we have...<br />
<br />
Hardcore - Those that spend 5 hours a night, 7 days a week to make world firsts. (want challenging content)<br />
Top End - Spend 3-4 hours a night, 3-4 days a week to defeat content to progress. (want challenging content)<br />
Casual - Can not commit more than a couple hours a week or couple days a week to progress. (want challenging content)<br />
Failures - Don't want to spend the time to raid every week and want things handed to them on a silver platter.<br />
<br />
<br />
And SecretArts, I believe you make several valid points.</div></div><hr />

No other MMO caters to Casuals like WoW and they(Other MMOs) have strived because of it. Regardless of whether it is easy or hard, casuals will continue to play this game, however the hardcore will leave if it is not challenging. <br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Survive like the rest of them.&quot;? Are you fucking joking? <br />
Yeah. Because Joe Nobody can tell the company with the largest and most successful MMO in the world how they're doing things wrong. Really, they should use the design philosophies of the competition that they have so utterly crushed into dust, pissed on, and laughed off the field. <br />
<br />
Do you realize how little Blizzard values 'the hardcore'? The hardcore aren't a high percentage of the game (and if they are, what's 'hardcore' about them?) population. Why should Blizzard build most of their content such that most of the people keeping them employed won't see it? To stroke your e-peen? If you want to feel all e-awesome, go film a sex tape with Algalon and see if you can get shooting stars to fly out of his.. er.. nevermind, lost my train of thought.<br />
<br />
Anyway! You have your hardmodes, that's about the best you're going to get with Blizzard henceforth if the obvious trend is anything to judge by. Live with it or show Blizzard you mean business by actually quitting.</div></div><hr />

this. Blizzard will continue to cater to the portion of the player base that makes them the most money. Be it Casuals or US based players (yes i am comparing the casual v hardcore argument to the US v Oceanic saga...).<br />
<br />
Money &gt; Small amount more of customer satisfaction. The truth of the matter is blizzard have well over 22million accounts active (ACCOUNTS NOT PLAYERS- eg: some players have more than 1 account) like they'll care about less than 10% of those accounts going inactive.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casual players have Naxx. Sartharion. Malygos. Ulduar. Onyxia. VOA. And Trial of the Crusader all gift wrapped and ready for them.<br />
<br />
So all Icecrown should be on the same level as all those, in the current state of the game? (average ilevels, etc.)<br />
<br />
No. No it should not.<br />
This is an MMO, not a single player rpg.<br />
You play MMOs over a longer period of time than any single player game could offer.<br />
Icecrown Citadel is the coup de grâce of WOTLK raids.<br />
I'm sorry you self-entitled whiners only have x hours a week to play. <br />
Icecrown Citadel is the last raid of the expansion. This is an MMO.<br />
Your constant cries for all content's accessibility (including the last and most 'epic' raid of the expansion) to be based on your available playtime per week is a goddamn joke.<br />
<br />
But putting the endgame of endgame raid for the current expansion on the same difficulty level as the rest of the piss-poor easy (non heroic/hard mode) raids?<br />
That's just absolutely retarded.<br />
I'm sure it will happen, which will be a real disappointment.<br />
Not because of the casual playerbase's pathetic argument of epeen (awful word btw), showing off shiny purples, etc etc.<br />
<br />
Everyone should have access to raids and equipment. Almost all parties involved in WoW now agree.<br />
<br />
But the casual playerbase continues to lack the understanding that there needs to be a goddamn CURVE.<br />
<br />
A curve that is based first and foremost on your GEAR.<br />
<br />
You take away such a curve, and you further the destruction of a persistent world with a endgame progression.<br />
<br />
Why can't you people understand this?<br />
It's not about showing off. But that is a plus. It should be.<br />
If the difference between player's gear didn't matter, then gear should be removed from the game.<br />
Oh look. You take away gear, there isn't a progression curve left.<br />
As now all raids are tuned to be immediately accessible once players hit maximum level.<br />
We don't gain stats once we reach max level.<br />
There aren't attunements to put raids in any order of progression.<br />
<br />
So with that in mind. If we took the FINAL and PENULTIMATE raid(and it's very high ilevel instance hub) in this expansion and handed it out on the same silver platter as all other raids/instances.. then wow... how utterly embarrassing.<br />
<br />
Gear progression is already a pretty laughable experience in the current game.<br />
3.2 made sure of that. Now everyone has a very easy way to gear up and be on par with everyone else.<br />
<br />
Such a process has absolutely no reason to repeat itself in 3.3<br />
<br />
<br />
You prick - you don't even know what the raid is going to be like yet lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The letter on my keyboard that is left of W started to glow draining awesome power from this post!<br />
<br />
Blizz was clear that killing Arthas will be a raids job.<br />
<br />
As I can see this 5 man is more like a recon and quick strategic blows (spec ops style). The encounter with Arthas will add flavor and saspens but it is highly possible to end with an tactical (or not) retreat. Defeated but with precious data from inside the citadel.<br />
<br />
I find these instances very exciting. I really can't wait the next patch.<br />
<br />
P.S. QQ: patch 3.1 - No 5 man, we are bored!<br />
QQ: patch 3.2 - ToC (5 man) Too small and easy!<br />
QQ: patch 3.3 - We fight Arthas, lame!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, it's quite clear that you're not meant to defeat Arthas on the five-man runs. Jaina and Sylvanas are obviously added to provide an in-game excuse for him to get away.<br />
<br />
Most likely Jaina stops the party from slaying Arthas because she wants to see one last time if he can be redeemed, or he calls out something melodramatic. It all gives him just enough time to bubblehearth away to wherever the main big raid will fight him.<br />
On the other side, Sylvanas probably wants to have the killing blow and particularly savour it/taunt Arthas over his imminent permanent death. It'll result in the same kind of pause and fast escape.<br />
<br />
The group then gets to pillage Arthas' bedroom or something and wear his bedsheet as an epic cloak :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
Casual players have Naxx. Sartharion. Malygos. Ulduar. Onyxia. VOA. And Trial of the Crusader all gift wrapped and ready for them.<br />
<br />
So all Icecrown should be on the same level as all those, in the current state of the game? (average ilevels, etc.)<br />
<br />
No. No it should not.<br />
This is an MMO, not a single player rpg.<br />
You play MMOs over a longer period of time than any single player game could offer.<br />
Icecrown Citadel is the coup de grâce of WOTLK raids.<br />
I'm sorry you self-entitled whiners only have x hours a week to play. <br />
Icecrown Citadel is the last raid of the expansion. This is an MMO.<br />
Your constant cries for all content's accessibility (including the last and most 'epic' raid of the expansion) to be based on your available playtime per week is a goddamn joke.<br />
<br />
But putting the endgame of endgame raid for the current expansion on the same difficulty level as the rest of the piss-poor easy (non heroic/hard mode) raids?<br />
That's just absolutely retarded.<br />
I'm sure it will happen, which will be a real disappointment.<br />
Not because of the casual playerbase's pathetic argument of epeen (awful word btw), showing off shiny purples, etc etc.<br />
<br />

Then through out the instance we get to see small areas of dead scourge or maybe a dead NPC hero marking their passage.<br />
Once we get to the Lich King, we see him very close to killing and draining the opposite faction leader, so we jump in and push him back long enough to pick up the pieces and flee, realiseing that we are too weak at the moment.<br />
It would give some nice dialogue and give an increase good feeling between Horde and Alliance that Garrosh and Varian can bugger up for us again later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
God of war 3; do you get pissed when you turn it up to godmode and you have to fight the same boss? you can easily kill the same boss in easy mode lots of times.<br />
<br />
This is an old system for gaming because there isnt and will never be a &quot;right&quot; difficulty lv. In this mmo they are also rewarding you better if you do them so you can show off if you want to.<br />
<br />
PS: they messed up toc hardmode, most of the fights are more hp/power bosses which kinda sucks. they should be the same bosses but make it in into semi similar fight with lots extra abilities.</div></div><hr />

Everyone who pays like the game and im pretty sure that all dont want to have to be 20/7 hardcore players to enjoy all the content that blizzard implements. Some people may enjoy a less stressing instance dificulty(also referering to boss strat). I dont wanna waste more than 45 minutes in a 5man dungeon. Maybe with this 3 lvl dungeon , players will need more time but IMO if the difficulty is too much ill just be bored from all the wiping.

<br />
If we cant have everything we want, at least give us a dungeon like Black Temple. BT had a very very obvious curve once you got past supremus/akama that let lesser guilds (casual guilds included i suppose) experience the raid yet left the meat of it to be enjoyed by those that... wait for it... were SKILLED enough and really WANTED to put in the hard work to do it. <br />
<br />
Having a dungeon for those of us that really ENJOY raiding and dont just show up for free epics is so incredibly fun. Honestly id also say that its more beneficial to the game in a way, If you give everyone access to everything its going to end up leading to boredom with people having less to work towards when it comes to raiding.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
To comment on the two things im sure that will be brought up, Sunwell was very fun for those of us who enjoy raiding yet coming from someone who completed it i would agree it may be a little too extreme to be reproduced exactly. I always thought they should create a dungeon along the lines of ulduar with not just one hard boss off to the side (algalon) but an entire wing (copy and paste sunwell in here) for top end raiders to go and enjoy. This however takes me to my next comment...<br />
<br />
<br />
Hard modes are a cop out. Ive completed every hard mode to date minus Anub and i can honestly say i despise them. Having actual original bosses who have one level of difficulty that is on par with a &quot;hard mode&quot; is infinitely more fun than this method. Im all for casuals and lesser guilds having access to bosses but when the hardest fights of a raid are the exact same bosses simply with new abilities it brings a whole new level of boredom to raids. ToC is an extreme version of this, fighting the exact same boss in the exact same room four times a week is by far the most unenjoyable thing ive done in this game yet.<br />
<br />
I guess all im asking for is for &quot;hard modes&quot; to be entirely different bosses in different areas of the raid, give us something different and original.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh and the 5 man should definately end with Arthas demolishing us, not him retreating.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sorry but skill and HARD WORK on a mmorpg are completely different than a consol game. Name off one person that WORKS HARD TO DO THE RAIDS that doesn't play a ridiculously 5+ hours EVERY DAY of the damn month. Sorry not everyone has that much time to put HARD WORK INTO raiding. You're getting things mixed up with people who don't try and people who try but don't play enough to get as good as others..... Maybe when you have kids and a fucking full time job you can grasp this, and hey maybe you do then good for you. But not everyone and their mother wants to spend 5 hours 3-5 times a week not counting 2+ hours of farming for shit daily just so they can kick some end game raid bosses ass.... this is a MMOrpg you have your hardmodes which some guilds still can't fully clear.... trust me i don't think people who don't try should be able to do some of the things others can seeing as they don't put at least that little amount of time into it. But lets get honest here there are just people who can't do that much as still try.<br />
<br />
It's a god damn game for christ sake it's not like it's a sport. Not everyone thinks HARD WORK is fun. Games are meant for fun...<br />
<br />
And yes sports are games.... they push your limits mentally and physically. I don't think this game does this at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep your hardmodes and let the people play and enjoy their 15$s a month. All this game is for is to come home after a long day and relax for fun to let loose and escape some drama or life for a few hours if needed. Not wake up after staying up till 2 AM in the morning playing wow to crack open a redbull and start farming for the day.</div></div><hr />

I find it very funny that some people (who are obviously elite raiders who have cleared Uld HM incl Algalon and gotten tribute chests in ToTC25) have so damn low selfesteem that casual raiders getting gear several ilvls lower than theirs is completely ruining their gaming experience.. Get over yourselves, the only thing you have others don´t is to much damn time on your hands.. YOU ARE NOT SPECIAL FOR PLAYING A VIDEO GAME..<br />
Children play this game, family men/women play this game. They pay the exact same subscription as you so called &quot;elite raiders&quot; do.. It´s only fair they get to see some content, and 99% of you douches complaining everything is too easy, are obviously stating this based on what others have done, not yourself..</div></div><hr />
