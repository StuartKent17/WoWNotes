Blue Posts<br />
<br />
Increasing the crit rating on plate to compensate the crit given by agi<br />
Warriors don't need to have the same amount of crit as rogues to do the same (or sometimes higher) damage. The only risk is that rogues who scale both AP and crit from Agi will end up doing higher damage with extreme gear levels, but usually we have the opposite problem. In any case, at extreme gear levels crit often becomes less and less valuable.<br />
<br />
We balance warriors around wearing plate. When they can then wear leather and do higher damage (and who can blame them for making choices that maximize their dps?), that presents a problem and the solution is often to nerf warrior damage, which then hurts the guys actually wearing plate. We need to finally fix this design flaw, which we're doing in two ways: itemizing leather the way we itemize plate (i.e. just Agi rather than Agi and AP) and giving warriors more of a benefit for wearing plate.

Nerfing Mortal Strike debuffs<br />
Yeah I don't think we could nerf MS on live without also nerfing healing, which obviously makes it more than just a quick fix. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626283267/mortal-strike-needs-20-fix-now-not-in-4-0/))<br />

Holy Paladins can't equip Daggers<br />
Well, it's more complicated than that of course. You aren't competing with priests and druids for your shields and nothing is stopping you from equipping a spell sword if you don't need the Spirit. A caster axe isn't off the table, but it would be pretty uncommon. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25626573044/strength-1-handed-weapons-in-4-0/))<br />

Dual Wield Talent<br />
We're not quite ready to talk about it yet, but imagine that the DW talent is accesible to Enhance early enough to be useful but not to Elemental and Resto. We're also looking at making enchants unique, which would let us drop the WF internal cooldown low enough that fast weapons might be more attractive.

Well there's only one of two things or both happening here: <br />
<br />
1) You're going up against healers who tremendously outgear/outskill you.<br />
2) You fail as a warrior.<br />
<br />
There's no chance they're ever going to nerf MS debuff anyways (especially considering how large health pools are going to be at level 85), why even bother posting that? Blue answered a stupid question. Nothing to see here.</div></div><hr />

The point is that its supposed to be hard to kill a healer. You are not supposed to one shot us. Also even if it takes longer for you to kill ys its not like we dont do alot of harm to you</div></div><hr />

Blizzard already stated that they're nerfing MS in Cataclysm, down to 20%. Chances are that they'll experiment with some different numbers to see what works, but they're definitely nerfing it pretty hard. They're also nerfing healing, so it will balance out and MS just won't be as required as it is on live. They're not going to nerf it prior to 4.0 for exactly the reason that Ghostcrawler stated. Healing would be too powerful if MS were nerfed right now, and they can't nerf healing without retuning all of the raid content. It's too big a change to do without a complete reset of gear and raid content.</div></div><hr />

I mean wouldnt it be cool if you could play like a Battlefield style lego game where u can build ur own vehicles and weapons? And if you could shoot peoples limbs off only for them to be able to reattach their own limbs or use someone elses. Would be cool playing as a medic picking up lego parts and putting them back on soldiers.

It's a difficult balance. On one side there are a significant number of people who are no good at World of Warcraft and have no idea what is best for the game; on the other hand those people pay the same amount of money as the players who are good at the game...</div></div><hr />

I don't think I've ever heard someone complain about too many healers in BGs. O.o<br />

Healers in battlegrounds are good. I wish they'd put roles into battlegrounds like the dungeon finder so that you'd always have a healer. Maybe 20-30% of the raid can be healers.</div></div><hr />

The problem isn't the fact that healers are able to keep themselves alive while fighting a dps, the problem is that they can keep themselves alive indefinitely. This occur due the infinite mana pool they have at the moment. The regen is too good, and the tool to regen are too powerful, so healers don't go oom. They said they know about this issue, and healing will be a bit harder and more challenging, cause you will be able to go finally oom, and you need to choose the right spell. That said, healers will go oom, it's right that they are able to keep themselves alive under the attack of one dps, it becomes a problem if they are able to keep themselves alive for too much, going oom will solve this. <br />
Remember a few things, whining for something in beta/not even out/not even testable, it's useless. Game isn't balanced on 1v1, as they say, so if you can't kill a healer by yourself it's not an issue, and if you can't in arena it means you need a different setup or more skill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean wouldnt it be cool if you could play like a Battlefield style lego game where u can build ur own vehicles and weapons? And if you could shoot peoples limbs off only for them to be able to reattach their own limbs or use someone elses. Would be cool playing as a medic picking up lego parts and putting them back on soldiers. If it was done in a serious non kiddy no campness way, i think it would be a damn good game.<br />
<br />
What I got from watching it, you can basically do this. You can do just about anything, which is the entire point of legos is being able to let your creativity run like a 6 yr old given a dozen cases of red bull. But we'll have to wait and see when the game comes out to be sure of what all you can really do.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. I'm actually considering buying it when it's out. It looks very good IMO.</div></div><hr />

Healers in battlegrounds are good. I wish they'd put roles into battlegrounds like the dungeon finder so that you'd always have a healer. Maybe 20-30% of the raid can be healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
This one time... I got into a WSG with 4 resto druids, 2 resto shamans, a holy priest and a disc priest, a holy pally and a prot pally. I'm not joking. We ended up losing because we couldn't kill anyone :(</div></div><hr />

I feel most of the news are fillers from devs and not even worth discussing as they might change in the future...<br />

We can beta... NAO... AND TO THE CHOPPAH!</div></div><hr />

There's never been too many, on alt healers i've rarely had competition on &quot;most healing done&quot;<br />
<br />
Could be worse, I remember a time where everything I targeted was retlol. That was sooooo much fun</div></div><hr />

You are not supposed to one shot us. Also even if it takes longer for you to kill ys its not like we dont do alot of harm to you<br />
<br />
Mate, I have been healing alot of bg's since TBC on a druid, pala, shaman and priest and I know even with MS it's still almost impossible to kill most healers, I know you're not supposed to 1 shot healers but when it takes 6 dps to kill a tree even with MS you know something is wrong, now it's going to take most of a 15 man raid to kill 1 single healer, and when I pvp on alliance the horde healers rarely ever die, if any healer dies more than twice in a single 15 minute bg then that is bad. I've healed 1.8 million in AB and didn't even die once, healers are not supposed to be killed by 1 horde but they shouldn't be this insanely OP aswell you need a balance.<br />
<br />
And Bucky Mclachlan, so as a warrior you can solo healers? maybe if you're full wrath with a 264 weapon and the healer is bad geared but if you think you can beat another healer equally geared 1on1 then I'd love to see, even when I was gearing my chars with 400 res and shit gear I still didn't die.<br />
<br />
&quot;I don't think I've ever heard someone complain about too many healers in BGs. O.o&quot;<br />
<br />
Well when you're alliance with 1 healer up against horde with 5 healers or sometimes 6 out of 15 people then it's pretty shit, not counting the hybrid classes like shamans, retlols and shadow priests so when you take that into account, sometimes 10 of 15 have the ability to heal. As a healer I can keep so many people including myself alive for ages unless I'm ganked so with 6 healers on a small map like eos it's almost impossible to kill anyone.</div></div><hr />
