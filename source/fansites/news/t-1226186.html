A Little Patience Scenario Video<br />

Heart of Fear Raid Finder Loot Issue Hotfixed<br />
I have an update for characters that experienced this issue. Those characters have been given two Elder Charms of Good Fortune. Those charms will be added the next time those characters login. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/244666-heart-of-fear-raid-finder-loot-issue-hotfixed/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7004017847?page=20#381))<br />
<br />
Cross-Realm Zones Feedback<br />
It was a feature developed to save money on server costs, but spun to the playerbase as being a positive feature to make the world feel &quot;alive&quot; again<br />
You're just not correct, and you have no basis for comparison to even begin to understand any financial motivations behind the implementation of CRZ. <br />
<br />
That's my biggest problem with a lot of the negative feedback I see on hot issues like CRZ: Not that it's negative, but that people usually need to explain the unknown by formulating what I'd define as straight-up conspiracy theories. And they spread like wildfire. We are probably in part to blame for it, but sometimes all the insights and behind-the-scenes facts just can't be shared in a meaningful way with the public. There's just not a lot to be accomplished by engaging with people who say such changes are financially driven (i.e. cost efficiency &gt; gameplay or customer concerns), or that they provide the path of least resistance for us in terms of our production pipeline.<br />
<br />
We come off looking very defensive purely by nature of responding to a fallacious, hyperbolic, or incredibly presumptive argument. And, yet, that somehow tends to validate a conspiracy on the forums. This is an extreme example, but I'll use it since it was posted in this very thread:<br />
<br />
Not gonna read your propaganda, you own wowinsider and they never criticize you when you do a crappy job. Your platitudinous tripe is just orwellian speak. There is no point to feedback, you don't respect anyone's opinion on this forum, and you never acknowledge your faults. There's also no point to public test realms, you ignore all feedback given to you in those as well, their only point is to flesh out bugs, not to criticize your game design. You guys are just terrible at your jobs, and too proud to admit it<br />
Most people probably (hopefully!) understand that this is a major leap into the deep end of connecting dots simply because those dots exist in the same space and time. And the people who truly believe this type of stuff are going to feel validated if we A) defend ourselves purely on the basis of liking things like truth and facts (even you used the term &quot;spin&quot; to describe this); or B) remain silent because the endless tug of war that could result is a colossal waste of organic material.<br />
<br />
Anyway, don't get me wrong. Your criticisms are well founded. I'll keep them in mind as I continue discussing the larger points of contention in the community with our developers and executives. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/244854-how-feedback-works-and-why-it-matters/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7006898525?page=14#278))<br />
<br />
Off-Spec Healing<br />
they already said they are nerfing it. <br />
Indeed we did. We completely agree that it is very frustrating for dedicated healers to find that off-spec healing is actually quite competitive with their own. Off-spec healers such as Shadow, Elemental, Paladin and Laser Turkey are meant to be able to output some healing - which is one of their benefits - but they shouldn't be able to replace a dedicated healer. The plan we have right now is to make PvP power only enhance either your damage or healing depending on the spec that you have chosen.<br />
<br />
Check out the blog by Ghostcrawler on Mists of Pandaria PvP here: http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/6415071<br />
<br />
So, all Paladins are off spec healers no? <br />
<br />
Guess it does not matter, Ret was made with one defensive mechanism, healing, after that gets nerfed (And lol, Ret healing is nerf worthy?) not a single person will play Ret, so I would like to congratulate u for destroying Ret.<br />
I was referring to Retribution Paladins in my post specifically and as they have the ability to assist their entire team with healing on-demand through the use of their abilities, they are able to off-heal. I will edit my first post to specify Retribution Paladins for you.<br />
<br />
It is also not entirely true that healing is the only defensive ability that you have, Paladins also have as I am sure your aware, Divine Shield, Divine Protection, Hand of Protection, Lay on hands and also while weaker if this change occurs, heals. There are other abilities in the Pally arsenal that can be used defensively as well, so stating that heals is the only way a Paladin has to protect themselves and others is not entirely true. Do remember that you would still have your heals, while weaker they could still help in keeping both you and your team alive. <br />
<br />
Understand that this is also not a definite change, it is simply something that we are considering to deal with the high healing numbers that are seen from some off-spec healers. We greatly welcome your feedback and thoughts on this, so please continue to provide it.<br />
<br />
I hope this is just a bad joke. Divine Protection, 20% less damage on a 60sec cooldon can hardly be called a defensive mechanism. Divine shield is a good ability, but 5 min cooldown? c'mon. You can't use Lay on Hands in the arena, nor can you use Hand of protection if you used Divine Shield.<br />
<br />
So basically you say that we have a nice array of defensive spells in the arena: 8 sec immunity on 5 min CD (instantly removable by Priests, Druids, Warriors), and 20% less damage on an 1 min CD. WoW. You are a PvP hero. <br />
I am not commenting on how great, useful or even terrible certain defensive abilities are, I am simply stating that there are additional defensive abilities available other than healing. Lay on Hands was more referring to the array of defensive abilities that are available, not that it is usable in arena specifically. I did also state that there are abilities that I have not yet mentioned, such as defensive CC as well as escape abilities that can help you get away, like Hand of Freedom and the first tier talent.<br />
<br />
And we have 20-25k healings after the patch goes live. <br />
Woah ...wait, what? This is in what patch notes now?<br />
As I already said, this is a change we are considering and is not in any way definite or final. So continue to give your feedback on off-spec healers and possible changes, we are listening to it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/244871-is-it-time-for-dps-to-stop-actually-healing/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5847988073?page=3#48))<br />

Battle.net World Championship – Raid Challenge<br />
Day Two of the Battle.net World Championship starts with a bang as two of China’s top raiding guilds, Stars and Supreme Quicksand face off in an exhibition live raid to clear Mogu’shan Vaults with the fastest time. Tune in to the live stream on November 18 at 02:30 CET to witness the competition.<br />
<br />
This challenge is sure to test both guilds’ skill and coordination. The competing players will need to plumb the depths of the Mogu'shan Vaults, choosing a raid composition and strategy that strikes a precarious balance between speed and safety. Do they attempt the run with fewer healers than the norm, to edge out their competitors and eke out precious seconds on the clock, but risking a catastrophic wipe? Or do they go with a tried and true strategy, secure in the belief that steady (but not slow!) wins the race?<br />
<br />
Each battle presents its own unique challenges, but there are a few that could make or break each guild’s attempt. The Spirit Kings encounter is perhaps the most taxing fight in the Vaults and is sure to be a pivotal moment. We can expect to see both groups play it safe here, because all it may take to secure victory might be succeeding on the first attempt while the other group falters. It’s notable that they will be facing a special version of The Spirit Kings where each foe attacks in the same order, to ensure that the competition remains on an even footing.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, both the Gara'jal the Spiritbinder and the Will of the Emperor encounters will require the groups to divide their damage between their main target and lesser minions. If they devote too little to the boss they risk falling behind on the clock, but if they devote too little to minions they risk becoming overwhelmed and suffering a wipe that could cost them time on the clock… and victory.<br />
<br />
Meet the Raiders<br />
Our colleagues in China recently had a chance to talk with guild leaders Bluewind of Stars, and Crayon Xiaobu of Supreme Quicksand, who will each lead their incredibly talented teams against one another in the Dungeon Challenge and live raid competitions. We’ve translated the interviews into English for your reading pleasure. You’ll find that, while these leaders hold each other in high esteem, both are prepared to fight for victory this weekend in Shanghai.<br />
<br />
Interview with Bluewind of Stars<br />
<br />
Q. To start, let’s talk about your progress through Mogu’Shan Vaults. Are you satisfied with the results? How are you approaching Heart of Fear and future Mists of Pandaria raid content?<br />
A. Actually, we’re not satisfied with the progress we’ve had in Mogu’Shan Vaults, and made a postmortem for this “failure” after we cleared it. It’s a really tough time for us now. Our raid team is composed of veterans and new recruits, as some of the once-hardcore members have become casual. Our team is in the middle of a training period, while their skill level is comparable with that of the veterans, new recruits need more experience. We didn’t consider this as a big issue, while we found out in the end that it really was. This is perhaps why we didn’t achieve the goal we had set for ourselves. Nevertheless, we are working hard for the live raid preparation -- been practicing a lot of Mogu’Shan runs and gave everyone quite some pressure. The new bloods are improving, and our gear is now good enough to meet the new challenge: Heart of Fear. After all, I would say I’m very confident for the next two raid dungeons.<br />
<br />
Q. Can you share with us the Stars procedure of learning new boss encounters?<br />
A. We always play hard when we confront a new boss, about 8-10 hours a day, which might be a bit shorter than other top guilds, but what we do more is that we sum-up and ponder over.<br />
Generally speaking, we’ll always take a quick trial of new bosses on PTR, having a brief impression of the boss. But it’s hard to do well on PTR, so we still need to make a plan that we try to cover everything that could happen in the encounter. This always takes us 2-3 days. Once the boss goes on the live realm, we’ll check our plan at the first moment in the live environment and make some adjustments. We always spend much time discussing, but we always enjoy the procedure.<br />
<br />
Q. BWC is at hand! Are you prepared?<br />
A. We have done some preparations for the speed runs -- took much time in learning or practicing the encounters. It’s hard to say whether we’re prepared, or whether we can defeat our opponent. As you know, Supreme Quicksand is a top guild that only spent 1 hour, 13 minutes, and 59 seconds finishing 25H Dragon Soul. They are very strong and powerful, but we will do our best to give everyone a wonderful competition.<br />
<br />
Q. Are there any effects the BWC competitions will have on your raid progress? Are you looking forward to BWC?<br />
A. There are, of course. The BWC event takes place when the Terrace of Endless Spring opens, so there will be some influences. But the BWC invitation is definitely a great honor. It has always been a dream for me, and for other guild members as well, to communicate with the game developers. So we’ll do anything we can to work with Blizzard for the event. I’m really looking forward to BWC. To compete against great opponents, to attend the convention, it will be an amazing experience for all of us.<br />
<br />
Interview with Crayon Xiaobu of Supreme Quicksand<br />
<br />
Q: Can you give us a brief introduction for your guild? When and how it was built?<br />
A: Our guild was called SEED, and was reformed into Supreme Quicksand in December 2005. Some of the former guild mates followed me; together with some new blood we established Supreme Quicksand as it is today. Our goal is to play WoW together without a negative impact on our work and everyday life, so here we are.<br />
<br />
Q: In a recent live raid event, you beat out five of the top Chinese guilds in Heroic 25-player Dragon Soul with a clear time of 1 hour, 13 minutes, and 59 seconds, and now you make your way to BWC to face Stars. Do you like to participating in competitions like this?<br />
A: Of course we like it. It is really a good chance to show our guild to others, and also to learn from others.<br />
<br />
Q: Did you watch Athene’s Dragon Soul Challenge that took place on May 12, where Stars came out the victor? What do you think about your BWC opponent?<br />
A: Yes, I have watched that one. Stars has always been a great opponent, and a coach to China guilds as well. We have been watching them since Patch 1.9, and we learned much from their videos. Their strategies have provided helpful information for our learning of the encounters. After the Dragon Soul Challenge, we watched the Stars live raid video again and again, and we practiced about ten times. But even with better gear we didn’t make it to break Stars’ record. So for the Live Raid at BWC, we know we don’t have enough chance to win, but we’ll do our best to bring a wonderful competition to the audience.<br />
<br />
Q: In addition to the live raid, the Dungeon Challenge is awaiting you. Are you ready for it?<br />
A: When we tried the challenge mode right after hitting level 90, we wiped again and again. It is really challenging like the name suggests, but also fun. After some practice, we did our best to find all the possible ways to shorten the time. Now that more raid dungeons are unlocked, we usually focus on the raid part. But we did some homework both on raids and challenge mode. We practiced and made plans for them.<br />

<br />
They already got their money off all of the people joining the contest. Too bad they charge so much and always have such paltry prizes overall. It's probably the reason why it gets so little fanfare. I mean it's kinda sad to see Starcraft suffering so much, all because they want all the control and will not let someone host a real tournament with any real money involved. Also charging people to watch is a surefire way to get no one to watch a tournament, very counterproductive when you want more people watching.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eugoogolizer</div><div class="date">2012-11-16, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'd really like to go post my feedback on how much I dislike what CRZ has done to worsen an already bad system, however it seems the wow forums refuse to let me on. My regular account login is perfectly fine. <br />
I really don't feel like they do respond well to feedback when it comes to CRZ. Just in my browsing of the forums over the past couple months, I've seen an overwhelmingly negative opinion of it. Almost any time you see a blue post on the subject they just say it was what they wanted to do and getting people out in the world, etc etc. Or they skirt the issue completely and attack the poster for not organizing their opinions in a more civil way. That one I've seen a couple times now.<br />
<br />
Mostly I'm not in favor of CRZ because of other factors. I'm an achievement hunter. Have been since the announcement of achievements. I enjoy accomplishing goals (largely arbitrary ones in this game, but goals nonetheless). The reasons for my dislike of it stems from the fact that old (Northrend/Outland) rare mobs have ludicrous spawn times, even for pre-CRZ zone populations. An amount which has been increased exponentially because of CRZ. 12+ hours for a regular mob in a now largely unused zone is way too high. Provided you'd even get the same CRZ where you had previously tracked it. That brings up another issue. It's completely plausible that with the shifting of people over the course of days or weeks, they could possibly never even have the opportunity to have even SEEN a certain enemy mob. Also for the battle pet issue. Same thing. Scourged Whelplings. Not only are there none on the CRZ I was moved to, but now I get to hang out with 6 other people from different servers waiting for the respawn of a battle pet that basically never occurs outside of when a server comes back up, if then. I've spent weeks flying around that little area they are supposed to spawn and nothing to show for it but a sore ass. It's also really obnoxious to fly over the area 20 seconds beforehand and see 15 of them, ripe for the picking and then the CRZ shifts to the one with none. It's a tease. Just move us on entering the zone period, not this lame lagging garbage when we land. Or the time zone shifts. Those aren't fun sometimes.<br />
<br />
The PvP server implications are even worse, but since I left my pvp server (partially because of CRZ, mostly because I just hate pvp in general) I don't have to worry about those anymore. It was so much fun being camped by the level 90's from KJ while I was in the 50's, cruising around Blasted Lands or some such place. Definitely improved my leveling experience, blizz... Then their response to such claims is something along the lines of &quot;Well your fellow guild members or faction can help you with that!&quot; Bullshirt. Pure, unadulterated BS. You think some cat is gonna cruise to Winterspring just to go fight someone for you unless they're a really good friend? In the zone and need help from someone there? Maybe there are no 90's, maybe the 90's there couldn't give a damn, maybe they're undergeared and would die too. Leaving the defense of leveling characters in the hands of other players is not a winning strategy. Sure stopping CRZ won't stop the issue of lowbies being killed by high levels, but you could at least stop feeding them from 6 other servers and in turn also stop feeding us to griefers from 6 other servers as well. Someone had a solid post on the CRZ feedback thread that I feel really illustrates the lack of sense in the system's current setup; <br />
<br />
<br />
by Retrimution<br />
<br />
so why not have a cross crz for people specifically within the level range of the particular zone. and then everyone else will get their regular servers and not have to deal with it.<br />
<br />
how does 10 level 90s in searing gorge improve anyones leveling experience?<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously I don't have a concrete solution. I'm too busy doing my job and school work to do theirs too. It needs work, but Blizz doesn't seem to be very vocal on several of the primary concerns people have, so we're forced to think they don't give a damn when they make posts on CRZ feedback, but don't actually acknowledge issues.</div></div><hr />

I like the &quot;alive&quot; feeling it brings. Those who complain about it are usually bad scrubby players who have no idea how to pvp/hide/get away from anyone. Sorry for you, be a better gamer. Yes even if you're 50 levels lower you can hug a tree,shadow meld,/golfclap or whatever it takes to get that prick to move along. If you don't like it, queue for a dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course you'll only see or hear negative feedback. Those with the strongest opinions are the loudest, and especially those with the strongest opinions against the standard, it's a simple fact of life and statistics. Best get used to it now. On top of that you have your own negative bias, so you're specifically focusing in on the opinions that agree with your own - another fact of life and something we all do.<br />
<br />
Now to move on to the problems you have against it, it seems that your issue stems from the fact that you dislike competition and thus dislike the added difficulties CRZ presents to you? That's whining. Same with the PVP complaints - more whining. It doesn't take much thought to realize that, in a MMO, if you're seeing nobody while flying around, the MM part loses its meaning. Competition happens. Snagging a rare mount or pet or spawn really isn't that impressive if you're the one person in the zone gunning for it.<br />

<br />
He did answer it when he said that they don't explain all the technical background to us. Plus, it isn't hard to do a quick search online and find out that servers aren't so cut and dry with regards to their tasking - I'm willing to bet that the same servers that run the individual continents also run CRZ alongside them, saving zero dollars as the hardware has changed not at all.</div></div><hr />

Those are screenshots with a GM i Had last night, that told me I was bugged, but not &quot;that bug&quot;. I will not be getting my coins, and neither will you.<br />
<br />
1) I went into LFR<br />
2) I did not kill Amber Shaper<br />
3) I was saved.<br />
<br />
4) I went into LFR days later<br />
5) I killed Amber Shaper<br />
6) I'm locked out of loot! No surprise here, since I was SAVED<br />
<br />
7) Blue says those saved will receive two coins compensation<br />
8) GM says &quot;their logs&quot; dont show me getting saved<br />
9) But he can tell &quot;I would have won a bag of gold from the boss had I not been saved&quot; &lt;- What?<br />
<br />
I want to know the &quot;multiple ways&quot; of getting saved to a boss in LFR that this GM speaks of. Because before this, I've never been locked out had I not killed the boss. Not in Dragon Soul, not now. And it only happened on Amber Shaper, just like -EVERYONE ELSE-<br />
<br />
Spoiler to get saved:<br />
1) Killing the boss<br />
2) Bugged out.<br />
<br />
I have one kill of Amber Shaper. If I wasn't saved, I would have WON the bag of gold that dropped. Instead, I was saved, and didn't get the bag of loot. But I &quot;Don't qualify&quot; ? What &quot;other bug&quot; did I experience, where I was locked out of loot from not killing the same boss that everyone else was bugged out on?</div></div><hr />

CRZ was put in for new players. So they didn´t feel like they were playing a single player game. I can understand them wanting to launch it with the new expansion, with all those new players. But really, even in beta it wasn´t ready All games, and all features have bugs.. but this is probably the only time since I´ve been playing WOW where I think they pushed out something that wasn´t close to being ready. It was already going to be a controversial feature, but all the bugs and side issues just gave them trolls more to throw at it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MasterHamster</div><div class="date">2012-11-17, 12:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They can't seriously be considering to reduce retribution healing can they. Their off-healing is pathetic compared to other hybrids, not to mention their atrocious manapool (two FoLs. TWO.) so they will have to compensate if they do this sweeping PvP Power healing nerf. Ret trades resources for either damage or healing, while the only issue a shadow priest would have to worry about is going back into Shadowform. Laser Turkeys got this sweet glyph so that they aren't even kicked out of the form when casting a heal. If anything Selfless Healer is the issue, but then again that takes a lot of time to stack.<br />
<br />
Reduce Selfless Healer to +20% healing per stack<br />
Add a 4-6 second cooldown to Word of Glory, increase it's healing done by 80%, make it heal for only 66% of normal on friendly targets. It's when Rets pop Holy Avenger that their offhealing (can) go through the roof.<br />
<br />
<br />
You realize most of the people doing the &quot;badmouthing&quot; do it because they love the game right? You need to consider both perspectives. Don't just believe everything one side has to say.<br />
<br />
if they loved the game they could atleast respect the devs and put a minute or two to write something constructive. Yes, of course you can be both negative AND constructive. But that seems rare.</div></div><hr />
