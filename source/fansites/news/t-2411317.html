Upgrading from Standard or Digital Deluxe to Collectorâ€™s Edition<br />
If youâ€™ve purchased a digital copy of Battle for Azeroth, but want to upgrade to the Collectorâ€™s Edition, we will automatically credit you the cost of the digital copy in Blizzard Balance - as long as you enter the Collectorâ€™s Edition key before 11:59pm PST on December 31, 2018. When you enter the key from your Collectorâ€™s Edition, we will see the original transaction on your account and the credit will kick in. Remember, you will need to enter the Collectorâ€™s Edition key before the end of the year, as automatic Blizzard Balance credits will be turned off at 11:59pm PST on December 31, 2018.<br />
<br />
Please note, if you bought a standard edition then upgraded to a digital deluxe, you will be credited for the original copy only.<br />
<br />
Standard Digital / Digital Deluxe &gt; Collectorâ€™s Edition<br />
If you bought the Standard OR Digital Deluxe copy of Battle for Azeroth and pre-ordered the Collectorâ€™s Edition, your Blizzard Balance credit will be the price you paid for the original copy.<br />
<br />
Standard Digital &gt; Digital Deluxe &gt; Collectorâ€™s Edition<br />
If you bought the Standard digital copy, upgraded to Digital Deluxe at a later date, then pre-ordered the Collectorâ€™s Edition of Battle for Azeroth, your Blizzard Balance credit will be the price you paid for the original Standard Edition.<br />
<br />
*Both stories will become available online later this year, but buying the Collectorâ€™s Edition will remain the only way to own the exclusive hardback version containing original artwork.</div></div><hr />

Why leave it capped? Buy some bonds and turn them into gold or something.</div></div><hr />

There's absolutely no reason why paying customers should be forced to go through third-party retailers to access a product. Orders should be made through the main company by customers when given the chance then shipped to retailers if shipping location restrictions are necessary.<br />
On another, why did they wait? Are they desperate? Did they trick enough suckers to fuel the corporate socialist net first?<br />
<br />
I'm probably gonna skip this CE either way. Its all digital codes.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathranis</div><div class="date">2018-07-14, 11:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Meh. First time they've offered a Collector's Edition through their official store, and yet they still don't have a method to get the in-game rewards at time of purchase, or even a way to upgrade from Digital Deluxe to Physical CE that doesn't involve buying it seperately and getting a refund. It really feels like they should have a better solution in place.<br />
<br />
<br />
That being said, with the price hiked up to $100 USD, coupled with the artbook, physical soundtrack CD, and Behind-the-Scenes DVD getting replaced with an illustrated novella and a big shelf ornament, I think I'm officially done buying CEs anyway. The artbook and DVD were like 90% of the reason I bought them, anyway.<br />
<br />
Oh well, I'd been debating whether or not I should stop buying them for a while, so I guess I should thank Blizzard for making the decision easy for me. Might drop the extra $20 to upgrade to Digital Deluxe at some point, but I'm not sure yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Without an art book, physical soundtrack, or mouse pad, what's the point? Oh cool, I get to pay $99 for a coin. No thanks.<br />
<br />
Pretty sad, since I had been looking forward to getting the physical CE until I found out how stripped it was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right? Like I can listen to that soundtrack on Youtube if I want to. Not only did they change the price of the CE from $80 to $99, but they stripped all the good stuff from it like the art book and physical soundtrack and mouse pad? Why the hell would I buy it...?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gourmandise</div><div class="date">2018-07-14, 03:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What a joke. Next, they won't release a CE for the following expansion and say it's because there was no interest in the BfA one. Fool, you made the CE uninteresting!</div></div><hr />

How is it stealing? They don't have to give you anything. They could make you buy the CE and not reimburse you at all for your previous purchase. You made the decision to purchase something before the CE.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why did you buy Standard, then upgrade to Digital Deluxe and then buy CE? If you had just bought Digital Deluxe, you'd get the full price back. Seems silly to upgrade twice, from standard to deluxe to CE.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Wait... what?! I bought the deluxe version instantly. Does that mean I'll still get the money for it back? I didn't upgrade from normal standard version as they say.Yes, first option states what happens whe you bought standard OR deluxe. So you get your money back.</div></div><hr />
