During the last weeks/months, it's been pretty clear that WotLK will reset the gear once again by making items like quest rewards nearly as powerful as the &quot;old&quot; raiding gear. Bornakk gave a few words of explanation about this. <br />
We did that for about 2 years, then The Burning Crusade came out, and we've been doing it again for about a year so far, seems it's about time for a change of pace and a real big update again.<br />
<br />
Also &quot;resetting&quot; the gear helps even out the playing field which can especially be helpful for new characters (Ex. Deathknights) or people who want to get into raiding. Those who want to be on the bleeding edge will get back to it, but I don't think it hurts anything to do this. No items you get make you permanently great, you need to keep playing to maintain awesomeness.<br />
<br />
I won't get into another one of these conversations too much, but the bonus that high-end raiders get is the items they have right now that allow them to be awesome. The gear gets &quot;reset&quot; from time to time, but if they still want to dish out the damage (or heals or tanking as appropriate), they know how to get back to the top and they might even pick up some new players in the process to help their progression.

Housing - A good addition to the game ?<br />
Drysc posted a short message about housing, if you're really interested in it you can always talk about it on the official forums but it really looks like Blizzard doesn't want to add it to the game now. It's fairly understandable because it would probably hurt the social part of the game, you'd have to give a fair amount of advantages to people for buying a house if you want them to actually spend money for it, and it would probably be a teleporter, a bank, a forge, or anything else you find in capitals. Also, we know what happens when people needs a lot of gold to get something better than the others players. ^^<br />
Heh, well skimming through it seems not everyone wants player housing at the moment. Not that we use the forums as a barometer for popular opinion, but anyway... Player housing is still something that intrigues us. If the place and time are right, and we can add player housing and make it a meaningful addition to the game, make it cool, we'll do so.<br />
<br />
Instead of making demands of what you want to see, why not discuss different features? The pros and cons of player housing, what it could add or detract from the game. It's far more pleasant to read.<br />

Lag fix - Repost<br />
I hesitated a lot before reposting it, but I didn't have any hate mail saying &quot;omg you broke my computer !&quot; the first time, so I'll assume it's fairly safe. (It's not like you'll be able to send a mail to complain if your computer isn't working anyway, right ?) <br />
<br />
A few weeks ago I posted this fix from the ElitistJerks forums and it worked well for most of the people but it's not really safe and it was supposed to be fixed in 2.3.2, however it seems that the Nagle Algorythm fix in the 2.3.2 patch isn't as effective as expected for most of the players, and if you're in desperate need of a lower ping this is still the best way to go. <br />
<br />
&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; Read this first &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;&lt;&gt;<br />
1 - It might have side effects, like slowing down your download speed or affecting your performance on other softwares. (In most case, it doesn't change anything, but you've been warned)<br />
2 - If you're not sure about what you're doing, just don't do it. I don't want to be responsible because you crashed your computer in some way because you made a huge error when editing the registry. <br />
2.1 - Seriously, if you don't know what you're doing, don't do it. <br />
3 - If you don't have the HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSMQ\ directory, you can download and apply this file (http://rapidshare.com/files/77255080/msmq.reg.html) to your registry. <br />
4 - Windows Vista users might want to check this post (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3271071466&amp;postId=33532161447&amp;sid=1#190) too. <br />

<br />
1 - TcpAckFrequency - NOTE if you are running Windows Vista this setting may not have any effect - a hotfix is needed which i'm tracking down. This works fine under Windows XP<br />
<br />
Type &quot;regedit&quot; in windows &quot;run..&quot; dialog to bring up registry menu<br />
<br />
Then find:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Services\Tcpip\Parameters\Interfaces\<br />
<br />
There will be multiple NIC interfaces listed in there, find the one you use to connect to the internet, there will be several interfaces listed (they have long names like {7DBA6DCA-FFE8-4002-A28F-4D2B57AE8383}. Click each one, the right one will have lots of settings in it and you will see your machines IP address listed there somewhere. Right-click in the right hand pane and add a new DWORD value, name it TcpAckFrequency, then right click the entry and click Modify and assign a value of 1.<br />
<br />
You can change it back to 2 (default) at a later stage if it affects your other TCP application performance. it tells windows how many TCP packets to wait before sending ACK. if the value is 1, windows will send ACK every time it receives a TCP package.<br />
<br />
2 - TCPNoDelay<br />
This one is pretty simple (Discussed here (http://technet2.microsoft.com/windowsserver/en/library/e6491291-872e-4260-8ced-77525b0d79a51033.mspx?mfr=true))<br />
<br />
Type &quot;regedit&quot; in windows &quot;run..&quot; dialog to bring up registry menu<br />
<br />
Then find:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\MSMQ\Parameters<br />
<br />
Right-click in the right hand pane and add a new DWORD value, name it TCPNoDelay, then right click the entry and click Modify and assign a value of 1.<br />
<br />
Click Ok and close the registry editor, then reboot your PC.<br />
<br />
Once you're done with the technical stuff (it probably won't take more than 1 minute if you're not too bad at it), you can finally get your reward.<br />

<br />
Even if in this case, the fix was used to decrease a very high ping, it seems to work very well on low (~100ms) ping for some people (lowered to ~20 or ~30ms).<br />

<br />
So this should be live already?<br />

<br />
Yes its in effect. But in reality it wont change much. The nagle algorithm is just packaging small packets and then sending them at the same time instead of sending them as they come. For the normal player it wont change much - small lag spikes will be less occurent because if for somereason packets are dropped it would only be one or 2 instead of the whole &quot;bundle&quot; - in that case it wont effect people on interleave lines - or less likely.<br />
<br />
Its more of a change for overseas's users who have a higher chance to drop packets and having to send a whole bunch that was lost rather than 1 better.<br />
<br />
I dont recommend disabling the nagle algorithm on your whole system - wow just disables it for world of warcraft which i think is fine.<br />
<br />
People will find disabling stuff like interleaving on your line to be much more effective.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoceeb4601474</div><div class="date">2008-01-14, 10:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Eh, people people... Not sure if WoW implemented Nagle disabling now or not (I think it did, I see about 10ms lower ping in game now), but as previous post says - that won't change much for most of the people (it's slightly better, but just slightly).<br />
<br />
Now, the fix you posted is NOT dosabling Nagle in Windows! TCPNoDelay - has no effect at all (tested it and even Microsoft page confirms) as it's just for one system service named MSMQ (and it has nothing to do with WoW)! No, you can't disable Nagle for whole Windows, only programs can do it when openning connections and using parameters to disable Nagle on that connection alone! Like WoW does for it's connection. <br />
<br />
TcpAckFrequency has nothing to do with Nagle, it's a different fix and it affects whole system. This alone drops ping considerably in every connection your system does (doesn't have to be Windows, can be set on Linux and MacOS as well!) but usualy drops your max. transfer speed as well a bit and on slower NIC/CPUs can drop FPS too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrostemplar</div><div class="date">2008-01-14, 11:32 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">IMHO Housing would be a great addition to the game, particularly if well implemented. The only reason I see against it is &quot;because it requires development resources&quot;. Which, taking into consideration the amount of money that wow generates and the relatively separated nature of this development is simply a not very good reason.<br />
<br />
How would I like to see it? Simply as instanced neighborhoods, in different areas. So that in the Stormwind area you went through the gate and you could choose what neighborhood you would go to. In there a full living community could be instanced, with different sizes, positions and house prices. This is all very similar to LOTRO house implementation (brilliant).<br />
<br />
Regarding the social aspect, tbh people socialize mostly by &quot;farming&quot; IF (on the alliance side). Meaning sitting att the bridge doing.. nothing really :P. There isn't all that interaction when a player is crafting at a forge/lab/.. whatever.<br />
<br />
And having the ability to customize your house would be great.<br />
<br />
Guild houses could be of another level, both in size and in scope, and they would share the space in the neighborhoods with the other houses. And have a visual representation of ingame accomplishments.<br />
<br />
I wonder how many people would visit Nihilum Guild House ^^</div></div><hr />

And guild master could hire mercenaries to help defend the castle if the guild is raiding for example when the war begins. Ragnarok Online and maybe Guild Wars too has similar features.<br />

Check out Age of Conan. There will be a contested region where guilds build battlekeeps and they can be sacked by other guilds or by NPC raiders.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Might of Menethil at ~90dps was on par with anything you could get until crafted epic weapons, and was much better than that 60-80 dps greens/blues you saw throughout the 60-67 range. so yes it gives you a distinct advantage in leveling, however even at that most/all of it will be replaced by 80. plus this time around everyone will have season 4 or pve equiv gear to grind in, giving the length of seasons.</div></div><hr />

I have characters on both Spinebreaker EU and Shattered Halls EU, before the fix Id get about 150ms on SB and 350-450ms on SH. <br />
<br />
After the fix, my ping on SB is a butter smooth, steady 70ms and on SH I shaved off about 100, now I usually get 200-250ms. If you are worried about it affecting your download/upload speeds on other applications, I cant say I've noticed any difference, at least my downloads (usenet, torrent) are just as good as they were befove I applied the fix.<br />
<br />
Regarding gear reset, only people who obtained their epics through dishonorable means, or simply lazy people are QQing. Any regular WOW raider is actually looking forward to new raids, new instances, new challenges, new bosses and most certainly new rewards.</div></div><hr />

<br />
agreed, by the time wotlk comes out mh/bt will be farmed by a good percentage, just as bwl/aq40 were, and sunwell i imagine will be similar to naxx. a fair amount of people will get in and see it, maybe not totally clear it, but a lot of people's gear will be stagnant and they will be ready for new content, and ~2 years in between leveling grinds is not so much to ask, i really enjoyed 60-70...</div></div><hr />
