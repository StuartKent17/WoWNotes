<br />
Its going to be nice only having to buff every 30mins, although I'm not looking forward to the arena nerf that my 3v3 is going to encounter (Pala / Afflic Lock / Shadow Priest). Also not looking forward to the mad rush on the interface websites, but that only usually lasts a week or so. :)</div></div><hr />

Tomorrow when you install it. The only full list of changes you can find. :]</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for Halo being the most anticipated game in the world, it makes me sad reading that, seeing as the game is one of the most mediocore (but surprisingly successful) games in existence..<br />
<br />
Give me Half Life 2, it has better graphics, better multiplayer and gameplay, and its been out for a few years already.<br />
<br />
Enjoy Master Chief's new +7 poly viser and new &quot;shader&quot; technology thats been around for 8 years.</div></div><hr />

I see. Well, what im looking for is whether or not the trees in skettis are going to be gatherable or not. In the PTR some guildies killed some of these trees and were not able to herb them. Is this something that will be implimented live? If it is, my raid mats and gold is seriously going to be gimped. :(</div></div><hr />

While Blizzard certainly cares about your distraught, there were voiced and serious concerns about the environmental issues raised by felling down trees, regardless whether they were mean elite ones - they are trees anyway and we all have carbon emissions to take care off...<br />
<br />
So please endure it with stoicism.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, more seriously, I have no idea but the reports I've seen from the PTR put the trees as non herbable anymore (this last info was put here just to make this post slightly useful.. just slightly though... :p).</div></div><hr />
