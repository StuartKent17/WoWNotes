Micky Neilson Leaving Blizzard<br />
Micky Neilson has worked at Blizzard for 22 years and is currently the Publishing Lead, working on projects like Overwatch: First Strike (http://us.battle.net/overwatch/en/blog/20063489/), an upcoming upcoming Overwatch graphic novel. Reidor on Twitter (https://twitter.com/Rodjer_Freeman/status/711255423903473665) shared the news from his newsletter. <br />
After 22 years, I'm leaving Blizzard.<br />
<br />
The time has come for me to pursue personal projects that I love. I'll be moving from California to Washington State. My last day at Blizzard will be March 25th.<br />
<br />
I look forward to working with Blizzard on freelance projects, one of which will be announced shortly. Aside from that, my upcoming works might include more game-related writing, script writing, consultation...and most certainly, novels. All of which will be announced and discussed right here in this newsletter, once a month. <br />
<br />
I spent some of the best years of my life at Blizzard. It's a bittersweet departure to say the least. But I'm excited for the all the opportunities that lie ahead! <br />
<br />
So...there you have it, the big news. Thank you for all your continued support!<br />
<br />
Hope this finds you all well.<br />
<br />
Stay awesome,<br />
--Mick</div></div><hr />

Sinking ship. The sinking ship that is nearly 5 times bigger than the second gaming studio. just lol.</div></div><hr />

While it is true the quantity makes it easy to jump to the same conclusions that people have been spouting for years without proof, the same remains true.<br />
There is no proof or evidence to suggest there is a common reason they are leaving, especially given the huge variety of roles.<br />
<br />
There will be clusters by chance, and there will be clusters due a reason.<br />
We just have no evidence to prove the latter.</div></div><hr />

Don't read into to much. 20 years are a company is a long time. People move on, hell most people don't even make it 10 years at the same place. I would only start worrying if leads on current projects start bailing.</div></div><hr />

He's been working for the same company for 22 years. He wants to do something new.<br />

If not that i don't see myself ever staying in one company more than 3-5 years less its just perfect (which so far after 6 years as civvy aint happening).</div></div><hr />

It happens with pretty much every company.<br />
<br />
Also wow I'm sorry but the Warcraft movie is just looking worse and worse the more I see of it. I'm losing hope, which is too bad. The first war is some of the strongest lore out there but the more we see, the more it looks like they're making lots of really &quot;typical&quot; Hollywood changes to the plot. Of course I could be wrong, I'm only going off what I've seen so far, but we'll see soon enough.</div></div><hr />

As for the Warcraft movie, still not feeling it. It still feels like its going to be corny, hopefully Gul'dan won't suffer from it. Also WTF is up with their choice of music, it didn't fit at all...</div></div><hr />

<br />
HIGHLY doubt it, people leave companies usually after 10-20 years, no different with blizzard, if there were internal issues people would know considering many players have also stock shares with blizzard, meaning they have the right to know these things, meaning also they would come out and say it, and aswell, internal issues would mean most likely delays with most products as with most companies with that kind of problem<br />
<br />
so in short..no..i dont think there is internal issues, and people leaving is just normal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because older folks remember working at a place 20-40 years so you can retire from there. Pension, retirement, pay -- all of which took care of the workers well.<br />
<br />
Younger folks, likely such as yourself, have never worked under such places where you could expect to retire from a place and be happy.<br />
<br />

Just my personal experience. Businesses have systematically removed workers pensions, unions, retirement -- it's been a race to the bottom. As such if you find a place you can work at for more than a handful of years, it's surprising to want to leave it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and him jumping off the tower onto the gryphon is like the most overplayed clip of all the trailers, its like in every single one, we get it, its a cool moment but seriously. <br />

I'm pretty excited, this movie looks to be a movie anyone can just jump right into without even knowing/playing the games, which is prob the intent, widest possible audience, most money etc and also draw people into warcraft series and wow, cant wait for the &quot;you've seen the movie, now come try the game&quot; ads after this is out for awhile, calling it now.</div></div><hr />

Mickey Neilson is not a WoW person. He does stuff for all of them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Problem with the I'm-leaving blueposts is that they will never say the negatives that drove them to leave.<br />
<br />
That's either because a) they don't want to burn bridges or b) it wasn't necessarily something about working there that made them decide to leave. a) is often the most reasonable assumption because everyone who actually works does this.<br />
<br />
The fact he said he's looking forward to working with Blizzard with freelance work suggests he's just going independent. His job dealt with the freelance people so he knows exactly what that involves.</div></div><hr />

Basically. Also 22 years older can easily mean games are just less... interesting than they were when you first joined. I work in the industry - a lot of the older developers admit they barely play games anymore and are more interested in families, hobbies, politics or whatever.</div></div><hr />

A small (but vocal) group of people just love to shit on anything Blizzard/WoW related. No idea why, given how they're meant to be fans and why wouldn't you get behind something you love? <br />

This film needs to do well or we won't get more. We should be telling everyone to go see the thing, not completely write it off after seeing a few mins of it in trailer form.

Just because you or someone else is a fan does not mean they have to like everything that's thrown at them. An actual fan would be able to criticize as well as enjoy.

so if you work for a company for 22 years (more then half of your life) and then you leave it to retire/do you dream, that means the company is dying?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Crapping on something just to make yourself look cool I don't agree with for sure. Fanboying it blindly though is the same. Like I said a proper fan or someone who enjoys something would be able to see the good and bad.</div></div><hr />

That dwarf didn't sound anything like a dwarf, if that even was the dwarf speaking.<br />

That''s Kadghar not Medivh in the trailer. At that time Kadghar was a scrub mage. There has only been one picture of Medivh played by Ben Foster and it shows him in his full robes and everything.</div></div><hr />

Seriously guys, u cant jump on conclusion about Blizzard been a sicking ship. When they hiring for a new Diablo game, launching Overwatch in months, release a movie (that will give incomes to the company), have one of the biggest MMO out there, with a expansion coming out, a growing and super popular card game, and a moba.<br />

<br />
I don't care about the choice of music or anything, but I can't help but to feel the whole style looks out of place from scene to scene. The CGI looks well on closer up scenes, letting you see all the details and emotions, but during the quicker scenes, it looks very out of place and dough-like.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ghâzh</div><div class="date">2016-03-20, 08:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am I the only one confused by this?<br />
Why are movie producers doing this? What's the sense in having two different scenes? And which one are we going to see?<br />
<br />
Edit: screw it, links don't work. I'm talking about the the scene with the dwarf. In the second trailer we see Lothar standing next to him. In this short one we don't.<br />
<br />
It's because the post-production is an ongoing thing. The movie is not finished yet so different ad's can have scenes from different periods of time from the process. You can also see difference in the Stormwind funeral scene lighting if you compare the trailer to the tv spot ad.<br />
<br />
Ps. For all we know, the dwarf scene might even end up not being in the final cut at all.</div></div><hr />

Typical. Instead of having an open mind to something you can't even rate yet you still tell everyone &quot;it is not your cup of tea&quot;.<br />

I never rated it. I gave it my opinion had you bothered to read. Just because I say it isn't my cup of tea doesn't make it true. Read before posting next time.

I don't see praise. I only see idiots who come here and evaluate negatively an end product they can't even experience yet.<br />
<br />
It shows pretty much their state of mind towards WoW more than anything the few action snapshots show.<br />
<br />
It reminds me of the massive 1/10 ratings on metacritic before a product us even launched.<br />

Are some people so desperate they need to steal attention ?<br />

If a product stinks after you experienced it fully, I could try to understand, but spawning meaningless negative opinions based on 10 seconds of actions is moronic really.<br />

Well you are just such a person who evaluates a 2 hour long product after seeing 20 seconds of footage.<br />

Make your own conclusions how you would rate such a person.<br />

I know I can tell. Question is, can you ? who calls out a word like fanboy because he refuses to wait until he sees the final product ?<br />

You just lost all future credibility making such remarks really.<br />

Coming from the guy who used to praise the hell out of Hearthstone before it released then proceeded to bash after kinda hypocritical don't you think? I mean you were basically doing the same thing we do except praise before launch bashing after launch. Also am I not entitled to not be interested in the movie whereas others are from this footage?</div></div><hr />

One HUGE difference.<br />
<br />
I played HS around 10.000 times with approx 5 k wins.<br />
<br />
So I experienced the CURRENT state of the game. Not the excellent game at launch.<br />
<br />
You saw 10 seconds of a 2 + hour movie... and try to insult others by being fanboys ...<br />

I notice a HUGE difference here.</div></div><hr />

So people are allowed a positive opinion on it yet nobody is allowed to have a negative one? Great more hypocrisy from Benbos himself. And good for you people have easily played more so by logic their opinions outweigh your negative ones yeah?

<br />
People have high expectations and you EVALUATED already the final product after seeing NOTHING of the end product &quot;not my cup of tea&quot; <br />

Based on what ? 10 seconds of actions ? LOL. You even call these guys fanboys, well you are clearly a HATE boy without even knowing anything about the final end product.<br />

Never said I hate it but keep putting words in my mouth. I don't like any movie based on a video game partially due to it is very tricky to get it right as it has been proved. I never said Warcraft was going to be bad I mean I hope it does well and I hope everyone enjoys it. But cmon keep putting words in my mouth to get a point across I'm having fun. And again had you bothered to read I was not referring to the fanboyism/enthusiasm of the movie but blind fanboyism in general as well as blind bashing/hate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because ya' know everyone has landed a great job and worked it for 22 years right? This guy was hardly just another number punching the clock everyday saying &quot;another day, another dollar&quot;.<br />
<br />
As far as the movie goes, look at all the negative buzz from fans and the gaming community already, no matter what they do you wont be happy. So why bother even catering to them? Plus they already have those sales, because people can't help themselves, even to watch it so they can trash it. They have sales from the naysayers, as well as sales of new customers and kids just getting into the market. More than likely a bunch of cool things will sprout up, like another toyline, books, cartoons, fast-food promo's as much as everyone hates the idea of the movie, maybe it's a good thing in the end.<br />
<br />
Maybe they are trying to grow a new fan base along side the old one.<br />

I work in the industry - a lot of the older developers admit they barely play games anymore and are more interested in families, hobbies, politics or whatever.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately yes this is the way it is. I've known a whole bunch of people who were diehard gamers in their 20's and early 30's but as they got into their late 30's they steadily lost interest in games and things like family and hobbies replaced it. It's something they just did for a long time and now other things have become more fun. <br />
<br />
Most of the people I know in their 40's who play games a lot either don't have kids or have a spouse who shares the same enthusiasm for gaming as them.</div></div><hr />

Bwahahaha!<br />
<br />
Sure it won't. Hint: Even amongst the relative handful of people still playing the game, only a fraction of them are going to bother seeing the movie. And those are the only &quot;hardcore fans&quot; willing to dish out money for this joke of a movie to any significant degree.<br />
<br />
Movie's going to bomb so hard. Couldn't happen to a better company, though. A real shame. Especially after all the money they're dumping on the train wreck.<br />
<br />
That said, it might do better than Doom did. I mean, at least it's coming out a little more recently after the success of its game than Doom did.</div></div><hr />
