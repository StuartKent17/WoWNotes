Legion - Paladin Tier 19 Armor Set<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Paladin Tier 19 armor set. The normal version doesn't appear to have a helm yet.<br />

Legion - Survival Hunter Artifact Intro<br />
This artifact intro features a little bit of the Hunter Class Hall. <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Q))<br />
is it intended for other classes to be able to enter the rogue order hall?<br />
No, that's just an Alpha issue. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674341710948773889))<br />
<br />
Is the Garona in the Rogues Class hall the original timeline Garona? Or the Garona that became our follower?<br />
This is the original timeline's Garona. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674341874052689920))<br />
<br />
Items<br />
have a question about teleport items and northrend. Will Dalaran still exist there for porting. IE ring of Kirin Tor/Locket.<br />
The items given out in Northrend will continue to send you to the Northrend version of Dalaran. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/674342032987459584))<br />
<br />
Ion, thought you might want to know that Apocalypse (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/128403-apocalypse)'s flavor text is wrong. You guys meant sow and not sew, right?<br />
Hey, it's been known to crochet some seriously violent tapestries in its day. (Ok, ok....) (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/674282443944411137))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
are you a little bored at your current job? Honest question, not trolling. It seems you had your hands full at Blizz<br />
At Blizzard, I did some actual implementation work, fixed bugs and so on. I never have time for that any more, which is a bit sad. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672125954962030593))<br />
<br />
Any of you guys ever used calculus as part of a game design project? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672125233550127104))<br />
I recall a couple instances of calc, but it's super rare. Not necessary, IMO. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/672128513726484480))<br />
I have a math degree and I rarely use calc, why don't we teach stats in HS...<br />
I would support teaching stats not calculus in HS! Where do I sign? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672168144782266369))<br />
<br />
I remember doing differential equations on my design test. (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/672117689318432768))<br />
I certainly didn't ask them! (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/672125272120909824))<br />
Haha. It was the question about ArPen. I really just used it as an excuse. (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/672130374164545537))<br />

That's likely just a bug, would be pretty aesthetically unpleasing if they left that one gold disk on the shoulder.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Data analysis is one of the most prominent areas in modern tech and business. And regarding your example, someone who studied statistics would actually be able to determine the relevance of the average, taking account factors like sample size and outliers. You basically just proved the value of studying statistics, although i'm sure that was not your intent.</div></div><hr />

Metal looks the same as cloth, there's no distinction in sheen and polish of metal and the dullness of cloth. It's all the same value, so it all blends in better (which is probably why they do it) but it also softens the whole thing too much. All the metal looked like dull aluminum, or cloth painted to look like metal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't judgement armor, the helmet isn't the same, the shoulders aren't the same, chest isn't the same.<br />
<br />
Just because it's red and gold doesn't mean its the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This , this , this. The armor looks nothing like t2 , just because some of the color variants might remind u of it , doesnt mean its t2 . The hood reminds of t2? Maybe, but this one has an awesome crown and some cool glowing eyes , that go with it. I personally love the set , most cos of the hood/crown and the silver hand all over it. Doesnt get any more paladin than this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How so? T8 had a glowing thing on it , the mythic version has floating disks. T19 shoulders are also much larger than t8.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Love the Silver Hand theme too, very classy.<br />
<br />
<br />
my guess is: (in the picture)<br />
<br />
1st (gold/rep/purple) - PvP elite<br />
2nd (blueish) - mythic<br />
3rd (gold) - hc / normal<br />
4th (red) - PvP horde<br />
5th (green) - hc / normal<br />
6th (blue) - PvP alliance</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they do lfr the same way the did in WoD , then LFR will have again separate set bonuses and models.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gh√¢zh</div><div class="date">2015-12-12, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One question : Why are there so many colors for some tier 19 ? Anothers raid difficulties at Legion than LFR, Normal, Heroic and Mythic?<br />
That's what they have done with every set since vanilla. The off colours either end up not used or used for NPC's. And yes, this question is asked every single time a new set is data mined.</div></div><hr />

Holy fucking shit that pala set. Blue one and gold/red - AMAZING. If I would main Paladin, I would resubscribe just to get one of this. Unfortunately I'm a prot warrior and I will not comeback for &quot;The Blade of Whatever&quot; and &quot;Shield of Don't Care&quot; while peeps running with The Ashbringer. Yes I'm salty because I'm jelly. :)</div></div><hr />
