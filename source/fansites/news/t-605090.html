I was thinking the same thing. Stamina is a big deal for a Feral Druid. What the hell are Blizzard thinking?</div></div><hr />

One of the reasons they may have removed stamina is because they didn't want you guys to have more HP (Don't ask why) without gimping lower tier druids (ie, coefficient bust)<br />
<br />
Still, this is what I call a patch. Actual class changes... AV join as group option, and:<br />
<br />
<br />
Matchmaking: If a queued player has a personal rating higher than their team rating, the matchmaking system will now use the highest personal rating of a queued member of that team for matchmaking purposes, instead of the team rating.<br />
<br />
personally, I'm interested to see how the EM/NS thing will work out. Now they need to change Enhancement like so.<br />
<br />
Edit before post: spell hit on priest healing seems odd, but maybe they want to give you some offensive capability hen using DoTs, shackle or other spells?</div></div><hr />

Let's hope the other parts to the 'fake' patch notes come true for mages aswell. The 100% spell pushback on icy veins and the 30% spell pushback with the talent (frozen core was it?)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
spell HIT on priest healing bracers..... geee, thx blizz ???<br />

Maybe for when you're grinding outside of raids, you won't get as many resists? Not sure tho, it is a strange change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
they wont. its been said it will stay as 2 and 4, basically coz sunwell gear &gt; t6, but t6 bonus is made primarily of win</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kerwyn</div><div class="date">2008-02-21, 01:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">wtf emberstorm?<br />
<br />
<br />
That's... different.<br />
<br />
As only 2% decrease, that makes incin's cast time ~2.45s.<br />
At 10% full, ~2.25s<br />
<br />
<br />
More importantly, this would behave oddly with other haste gear. I'll reserve judgment until someone does some maths. <br />
However, if the ISB change is true along with this, we could be seeing a shift for destruction raid builds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: and holy crap, with points taken away from stamina, the new T6 pieces are amazing for DPS.</div></div><hr />

As a PVE rogue I like these changes on my t6. Stam? worthless junk.. give dps! And +23 hit for the stam and a bit of (crap) haste on the wrists? Finaly blizz got a clue I'd say :P<br />
<br />
And removing the stamina completly does fix the 4pcs t6 + 4pcs glad pretyt quickly.. Would you still bring your t6 to arenas if it has NO stamina on it? :P</div></div><hr />

Yeah, because you absolutely HAVE to wear the gear when on sta sensitive fights. There is no way in game to carry a few sets of gear, and change it before bossfights. <br />
<br />
Seems nomatter what, ppl always need to whine. If there would be loads of stamina there, im sure the same amount of ppl would come here and cry omg wtf blizz, we dont need stamina to dps. Get a grip .</div></div><hr />

All they did was drop about 100 stam of the 3 pieces. ie, made them completely useless for tanking.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping this is a bug of some kind, I find it very hard to believe that they would expect any druid to use an item with ZERO stam for tanking :(</div></div><hr />

the current live costs are:<br />
spellsteal: 649<br />
Slow : 627<br />
Blink: 626<br />
<br />
Now i hope they change the current arcane talent Imp Blink, it currently reduces mana cost by 50% but that reduction is alot less intresting when it only costs 400mana. <br />
maby that part of the &quot;fake&quot; notes comes true too, in those notes it was changed to either longer range or possible half casttime of fireball/frostbolt/acrane bolt after blink</div></div><hr />

Besides I thought they made sunwell open to all because the encounters are designed for t6 people. As I see it the only way to design encounters for that is to require people to have high HP and lots of dmg. You can get high hp by using pvp gear or high spelldamage with craftables, but both is difficult if not impossible to obtain without some t6. So the only logical way to make sunwell a gear progression instance is by adding items which both high stamina and damage, but seems like blizzard dont want to do that, wierd.</div></div><hr />

There is a new questline and that's what required testing I believe.<br />
<br />
Oh and Mystical Skyfire Diamond nerfed to 320 spell haste (20% cast reduction) for 5 seconds.<br />
It doesn't get consumed on cast.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's... different.<br />
<br />
As only 2% decrease, that makes incin's cast time ~2.45s.<br />
At 10% full, ~2.25s<br />
<br />
<br />
More importantly, this would behave oddly with other haste gear. I'll reserve judgment until someone does some maths. <br />
However, if the ISB change is true along with this, we could be seeing a shift for destruction raid builds.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: and holy crap, with points taken away from stamina, the new T6 pieces are amazing for DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
That emberstorm change makes no sense to me either. If they want destruction warlocks to use fire spells they need to give Incinerate a higher spell damage coefficient. As it is, it is the same speed as talented Shadow Bolt but scales worse so shadow bolt will always be the better spell. <br />
<br />
2% haste? Seriously, what's the point?</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
It's probably supposed to be 10% and someone missed it while polishing the latest PTR push.<br />
<br />
This is why we have PTRs, so crap like that doesn't make it to live.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, if the coefficient remains the same but incinerate is given haste from talents, I'll reserve judgment until I can see math. 10% haste is a 10% increase to Incinerate DPS, ALONG WITH 10% fire damage, equating a roughly 20% increase in incin DPS from one talent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: It's already been shown that haste is one of the biggest DPS increases for highly geared destruction warlocks, the question is - will this incin exclusive haste gain be enough to make it out-perform the super scaling of shadow bolt?</div></div><hr />

Yes if SB super scaling gets nerfed. And if taken into account with mage 15% fire debuff... <br />
<br />
Seems that Blizzard wants to switch for shadow to fire.<br />
<br />
On a slightly different issue, I remember in the Eoy's post regarding lock end-game (about 10 months ago) there was a discussion saying that DS should be nerfed or moved to an upper tree position (tbqh it seems strange that a demonology tree benefits from sacrificing the pet in such way that it is the best option ^^).</div></div><hr />

DS is in a horrid position, it needs to be in destruction (the only tree that it really benefits) or nerfed and given to everyone so that destruction builds can stop having to spend 20 points in a tree they get little benefit from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ok, found out about the new boss things. Quest starts in Rut'Theran (or any capital city) where an NPC standing amongst the Fire Festival citizens gives the quest to go to the Zoram Strand where the Twilight Cult has spread out. The quest item is a random drop off one of the cultists. Second drop for me.<br />
The letter you get from the cultists speaks of one of Neptulon's lords - Ahune (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/frostlord.jpg) and that his summoning will provoke Ragnaros to fight him (wtflolz?) and elemental chaos would ensue and consume Azeroth.<br />
Next step sends you back to Zoram Strand to spy on the near by cultist camp to figure what exactly are those guys planing. You're given an orb of transformation that turns you into a crab (buff says &quot;the twilight cultists will surely be fooled...&quot;. Then you just hang around some NPCs not doing anything and you complete the quest.<br />
-&gt; back to Rut'Theran<br />
After all of this 2 quests appear. One to go to SP and talk to a new NPC there which unleash the boss upon us (yummy!) and another one that tells that the Twilight has goten to the Dark Portal and have a small camp there. You need to summon some of the new elemental's minions and kill it. Gonna try it tomorrowz.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Latest news: I killed a minion, two of them even. Need only one for the quest but wanted to check variety. It's only one big ice giant elemental that does a simple frost nova 7-8 seconds, hits like a lil bitch and is lvl69. Doesn't seem to drop anything. (You summon him by touching one of the stones found near the Dark Portal). Name is Glacial Templar.<br />
Rewards from the quests are 5x Burning Blossoms (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=23247) and 10 for the final killing. They now give a 1 hour +3% crit buff. That's 20 blossoms easy which is 20 full hours of +3% crit buff. Need I say more? After the quest is complete you realize it's a daily and you can do it everyday for 10 blossoms (I think) each.<br />
<br />
EDIT2: The NPC in Slave Pens is called Numa Cloudsister.</div></div><hr />

DS is in a horrid position, it needs to be in destruction (the only tree that it really benefits) or nerfed and given to everyone so that destruction builds can stop having to spend 20 points in a tree they get little benefit from.<br />
<br />
<br />
It will - locks are bound to be a solid raiding class, although I'm not quite sure that propping fire is such a great idea, although it would improve mage/lock sinergy. <br />
<br />
Anyway, I'd like to see the Affliction tree buffed while destro is toned down. One thing that Blizz has to improve - besides perhaps the DOT dmg coeff (omg the pvp winefest ^^) - is having crit and haste affecting dot, is it is really hurting affliction itemization (and through it, the scaling).<br />
<br />
The DS thingy reminds me a bit of IAE (instant Arcane Explosion) of old - every mage specced into it, having to take a few useless talents in the arcane tree for that (but the arcane tree was always known for the amount of useless talents :P). Maybe a trainable DS (toned down - like 10% or a temporary buff) with a improved DS deeper in demonology tree is the solution (not a very imaginative one though).</div></div><hr />
