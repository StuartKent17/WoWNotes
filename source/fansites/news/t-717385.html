Cataclysm content removed from the site<br />
Blizzard asked us to remove all the content from the Cataclysm Alpha on the site. I don't have any reason or project to be an internet superhero because none of the underwear I have look nice over my pants and I'm in the process of removing all the content from the site.<br />
<br />
Obviously, it also means that a few rules changed for you, my wonderful users:<br />
<br />
You cannot post anything from the Cataclysm Alpha on the forums. You can only discuss what was already posted on official sites/blue posts. <br />
Any screenshot from the Alpha will be removed and will earn you a 1 week ban. We will start enforcing this rule tomorrow to make sure you had time to read this post. <br />
I will track down anyone mentioning an emulated server/sandbox on my forums, find where he lives, and steal all his left shoes. You will also be banned permanently for that. <br />
No Blizzard-hate posts either, I support their decisions even when they aren't the nicest thing for me. <br />
Obviously, bans aren't retroactive and you won't get banned if you posted about something 3 days ago. It will just be deleted<br />
<br />
Important - People who posted on the new Cataclysm forums should know about two things :<br />
Your posts aren't deleted, people who worked hard on compilations will just have their posts archived &quot;somewhere&quot; and we'll bring them back when the NDA is lifted.<br />
The new Cataclysm forums are also hidden for the moment. Stick to the old Cataclysm General Discussions forums and please be nice. <br />
<br />
I apologize for the short notice, the content will be back as soon as the NDA is lifted. <br />

Crowd Control in Cataclysm<br />
Not every pull is going to require crowd control, but there will be pulls that require crowd control, which isn't really the case today. Once you overgear content you overgear it, and you can take shortcuts.<br />
<br />
We're going to make sure warriors have reasonable crowd control. Redesigning Intimidating Shout is a likely candidate. Death knights may need something more reliable depending on how they shake out with the resource changes. We're making some other adjustments here and there, but for the most part every other class has something they can do. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702232902/so-if-cc-is-going-to-be-required/))<br />
<br />
[...] There are exceptions of course and it depends a lot on your group composition and the skill of your players, but generally we assume that CC is something for which the dps players in the group are responsible.<br />
<br />
Under that model, Mind Control works fine for priest crowd control since the healers have plenty to do already. Mind Control won't work on every type of target, but many types of crowd control have a target type limitation. We think having to approach a pull differently depending on your comp is one of those things that makes classes feel distinct from each other. It's hard to put together a 5-player dungeon group or a 10-player raid in Cataclysm that is totally helpless with regard to crowd control. If you don't like approaching encounters as puzzles to be solved, and / or really aren't interested in dungeons being challenging, then stick with normal dungeons or wait until you outgear the heroics.

Mob positioning bug<br />
It was pretty bad in 3.3, but then we fixed some things in 3.3.3 to get it back to how it felt earlier. In general, if you don't move at all, then a mob targeting you shouldn't move either. The only exceptions would be if they were trying to coordinate with their own allies in some specialized cases. But if you move, even if you rotate or shift just a little, then the mob is going to try to get back into position as well.<br />
<br />
There's some interesting speculation above for reasons I am perceived to have given for why the situation exists. :) The actual reason it exists is that if mobs did not quickly reposition, you could get them into a mode where they couldn't hit you because they would always moving back into position to hit you. They would be doing too much adjusting and not enough hitting. (I'm simplifying a lot, so suggestions like &quot;Why can't they just move and swing at the same time?&quot; aren't super helpful.) We don't want tanks to feel like what they're supposed to do is shift around constantly to minimize taking damage. It's a fine line between mob movement feeling correct and minimizing potential exploits. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702204830/still-nothing-on-mob-positioning-bug-eh/))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-death-knight/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Death Knight changes in Cataclysm<br />
For every player who liked the fast pace of having to hit a button every GCD, there were plenty of others who found it tedious, repetitive and exhausting. I'm just asking you to be realistic about the accuracy of posts you read that say &quot;Nobody was asking for this&quot; or &quot;This is not what we want.&quot;<br />
<br />
The main goal of the resource change is to buy DKs some free GCDs. Currently some abilities just can't compete, even if free, because you don't have the GCD to use that button. However, it's also not the goal that DKs stand around doing nothing for long stretches because all their runes are used up and everything else is on cooldown. Being GCD locked isn't a fun place to be, for any class. You can't vary your actions at all -- in fact you are often such a slave to those actions that you have tunnel vision for your UI (even if modded) and can't react to the dynamic nature of most encounters these days. If anything messes up your rotation, say you have to move or are temporarily CC'd, then everything just falls apart.<br />
<br />
We don't get every change in place before making an alpha or beta build. It's much like the way large patches roll out but to an even greater degree -- you'll see some changes, then some more, until the rate of change ultimately slows down right before ship. There are very few Cataclysm mechanics, and no classes, that we think are &quot;done&quot; yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702153222/dks-downtime-and-cataclysm/))<br />

Heroic Strike<br />
The design intent for Heroic Strike has pretty much always been that you use it to bleed off excess rage and convert that into damage. We haven’t been happy for some time that warriors can hit a near-infinite rage plateau, but we knew changing that would be a major overhaul (one best saved until now, for instance). In the meantime, we have to balance around damage actually being done by warriors. We can’t say “Well, we didn’t want them to convert nearly every white swing into a Heroic Strike, so we’ll just pretend they don’t when we do the numbers.” We have to balance around actual performance, not design intent, up until the point where something violates the design intent enough for us to want to change it.<br />
<br />
The Cataclysm design for Heroic Strike gets the ability back into the role where we want it. There is no reason to conclude warrior dps is hopeless without it. We have dozens of knobs to turn, from the damage done by Devastate and Shield Slam to stats on gear to the new passive talent tree bonuses. Imagine that we are changing every number in the game – some will get lower and some will get higher. That makes it fairly meaningless to try and do any kind of mathematical analysis on the way mechanics will work. I understand that the temptation is there though. :) Discussing the role of abilities or how they might functions is perfectly appropriate. Concocting equations that look something like X + [a bunch of stuff I can’t measure yet] &gt; Y is a little premature.

<br />
Inner Rage<br />
<br />
It could be 10% rage and 300% damage if those are the appropriate numbers to use. We provided numbers for some abilities in the preview so that players would get a vague sense of the intent of the ability. We tried to caveat that a lot so that players wouldn't freak out about the math. Numbers are trivial for us to change -- that's not the challenging part of adding an ability. (Now figure out the right number can be quite challenging).<br />
<br />
If the numbers scare you, imagine that we just said the goal of the ability is that when you hit max rage instead of wasting it (like you'd do today), you enter into a state where you do increased damage for increased rage cost so that the rage bar drops, but you aren't penalized for it. The trick to that design is we also don't want warriors just doing nothing until they hit 100 rage before they can start having fun. We don't want you to constantly be worried about trying to get Inner Rage to proc. But we also don't want you to worry if a string of crits or big incoming damage or something suddenly floods you with rage faster than Heroic Strike / Cleave / Execute can drain it again. It's a safety valve, but hopefully a fun one, and not something that rarely comes into play. If somehow we nail rage management so tightly that you're just never near 100 rage, then we'd have to come up with a different ability. I'm not optimistic that will happen given warrior history, but the Cataclysm rage model is pretty radical too. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24702031719/so-who-is-going-to-train-inner-rage/))<br />
<br />
[...] It's not supposed to be a double-edged sword. It's supposed to let you convert rage into damage at a faster rate when you have too much rage. In your example, you're going to be doing more damage (and therefore more threat) while its active. In other words, you are going to be doing the exact same thing (rage -&gt; damage) you would be doing if you weren't at 100 rage. There isn't a currently a warrior strategy that encourages doing nothing and just building rage, and I don't see why there would be one in Cataclysm. Maybe if Shield Wall cost 50 rage and you always needed to save some for emergencies, but we're not going to do that. At most you might need 10 rage for Pummel or Shield Bash, and even in that case Inner Rage doesn't drain your rage. It would be different if the mechanic was &quot;all your abilities hit harder, but your rage goes to zero for the next 30 sec.&quot; Normally, you should *want* to spend rage.

<br />
If you don't like it, you go make your own website and post stuff, but don't be surprised if you get a C&amp;D from Blizzard, too...if you post here, you get a ban. If you post on your own site, you could be sued. So...think about that.</div></div><hr />

The conspiracy theorist in me thinks Blizzard was just waiting for a week or so..that way, the Internet hype machine can properly steam up.<br />
<br />
I sincerely doubt Blizzard would have overlooked a site as popular as MMO-Champion posting alpha screens. Heck, the community managers on the boards knew and was telling people not to post them. So it may have been either a ploy to get more attention to the game, or the legal department was just slow. Either way, what's done is done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still, it was nice to get a glimpse of what's to come but I can understand Blizz not really wanting to showcase stuff at alpha stage. Whilst the internet has many resources for those that still want to look up these things and it's nigh-on impossible for Blizz to get everything blocked, it's definately wise to stay on their right side as one of the most popular WoW info resources on the interwebz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not like this will be easy to forget. I mean, it's been over a week and this site generates LOTS of traffic. What does Blizz think that this will accomplish? &quot;Ooo, we have to keep it a super-secret now 'cause if we don't no one will buy our expansion&quot;. <br />
<br />
I pray that wasn't their thinking because if anything, Blizzard, Boub's posting of those things confirmed my purchase. I was ready to throw in the towel next year and say, &quot;Whelp, off to the Old Republic!&quot; but when I saw all that info and those screens I was like, &quot;Whelp, guess I'll be paying 30 bucks a month to play 2 different MMO's now&quot;.<br />
<br />
I can see why you did it, Boub, I'd want to remain cordial with them, too, especially since they throw quite a few bones your way. No sense getting the ants all flustered. Still, this is pretty frustrating.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">maggiegal</div><div class="date">2010-05-12, 12:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">so why did it take Blizzard that many days to figure that out<br />
<br />
<br />
probably makes decent free marketing stunt before putting the cap on it. After all, if blizz was serious about restricting access they probably would have asked to have all this taken down aaaages ago, this way it gives people a sizeable peak before they change a lot of it, it was the first or second iteration of the Alpha which, as we all know changes loads. <br />
<br />
hell i remember in the WotLK Beta when Scourge Strike used to do 5k crits at lv 59. And people call DK's over powered now! <br />
<br />
Nicely, I actually have a mate in Blizz who has been keeping me up to date and has put my name forward for the Alpha, still waiting on the email (I'm guessing I'm allowed to say this as technically I have not played the Alpha yet nor agreed with the NDA) either way this user name is totally different to the one I use so *hopefully* i'm safe.</div></div><hr />

You are correct I think, makes perfect sense, i can see no other viable reason why they would wait so long.<br />

<br />
They were also trying to block out the end video for the Lich King fight before the Lich King fight was patched in. They don't want everything spoiled before the beta comes out. Hell, maybe even the beta will be closed and with a NDA. Either way, albeit frustrating, it's Blizzard's product and they have the right to keep some stuff out of view for a while.</div></div><hr />

This is why Blizzard asked Boub to take everything down. That poor SS of the day guy must have been crushed when he found out Boub posted enough screenshots to last a year. :'(<br />

Answer:<br />
Boubou gets to blatantly violate the NDA, we see a gazillion posts, A LOT of useful info put up, but oops!, now it's all deleted because Boubou didn't follow the rules that he knew were in place. And if we were to re-post any of the info that was up for near a week, we'll get a ban. Good game. &lt;3 hypocrisy<br />

But we don't know if he did violate any nda, maybe he didn't sign one, maybe he's not in the Alpha. I'm the last person to defend Boub, but in this case I don't think it's fair to target him for something he may not have done.</div></div><hr />

Cat is out of the bag. Although, my guess is it has more to do with some of the material they are working on is still very, very rough. Mostly Uldum and Skywall. <br />

So many people were off talking about/viewing the new content the populations on the servers took a nosedive, they want us back playing the Wrath content they labored so long to create. Cannot say I blame them. Seeing as how they just released ICC a relatively short time ago, all the news of Cata was probably causing many to close accounts until all the new content is available. Plus, with so many hacks floating around, the possible situation of massive account scamming was starting to loom over the horizon, as during the weekends when Blizzard CMs aren't always around, the official forums were filled with links and information that confused a huge number of people, and left many open to phishing.<br />
<br />
I'm content to wait, the small peak we had let me know it's all going to be worth it. Plus much of what we saw was in development and it'll look better next time, also, next time, we might be able to actually play in the actual beta. (prays for invite)</div></div><hr />

<br />
He is not violating it, he is complying with the rules. Yes there was a NDA but I do not believe he was under it. He asked for us not to post because Blizzard asked him to remove all Cataclysm content and that means ANY post on his website by him or his users. Bibi is just enforcing the rules with a ban.<br />

I'm not going to get banned for posting pictures back a few days ago when the client was first leaked, am I? <br />
<br />
<br />
Anyone posting anything before this news post will NOT be in trouble for posting any Cataclysm Alpha info, but anything posted the day after this new post will result in a ban.<br />
<br />
Also Don't forget to remove any Alpha links you may have in your signatures.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Answer:<br />
Boubou gets to blatantly violate the NDA, we see a gazillion posts, A LOT of useful info put up, but oops!, now it's all deleted because Boubou didn't follow the rules that he knew were in place. And if we were to re-post any of the info that was up for near a week, we'll get a ban. Good game. &lt;3 hypocrisy<br />
Then you probably won't be sued for violating the NDA, but you'll still be asked to take it down, and I would assume they have a countermeasure for if you don't. I'm tempted to see if a lawyer is around here somewhere. LAWYER! EXPLAIN!<br />
<br />
Either way, it's Boub's site and if he has to be under the NDA, then you have to, as well, when you post here. Simple as that. If you don't, then he gets sued, not you. He has the right to ban if you do when this happens.=P<br />
<br />
This isn't exactly hypocrisy. Boub is just acting with MMO Champion as an entire entity under the NDA, not just himself. Thus, if you post, then you threaten his ability to abide by an agreement, and thus he has the ability to ban you.<br />
<br />
Just think of the NDA as being followed by MMO Champion as a whole and not just Boub and you have the situation at hand..and it honestly sounds fair.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because its Blizzards copyright and ip, they can ask for anything Warcraft related to be removed from any site, if they want to.<br />
<br />
Mmo-champion is a sort of give and take for Blizzard, they know that the leaks generate hype for them, but they also have a line (which apparently you can cross for a week before they notice).</div></div><hr />

yes, because they want bad publicity over shutting down wow's most popular fansite. They don't need to run around hitting people with a club, when a simple few words will suffice.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Erh, not at all unusual. They asked Boub to take down the WotLK alpha leaks too. Understandable move anyway, as the expansion is/was evidently not at all finished in the leaked build (despite some of the zones indeed being incredibly polished for an alpha). I think we can expect to see a ton of changes in some zones for the beta still.</div></div><hr />

I remember these trolls back in 2006 and 2008. And their idiotic posts still fell on deaf ears while the leakage continued and Blizzard realized that leaking was profitable for them. <br />

This is actually one of the funniest posts I've seen in quite some time, and I find it this way because you're sooooooo serious in your thoughts.<br />
<br />
You disrespect him for taking down a few posts about Cataclysm when he could get sued for millions/lose his website/lose any future Blizz insider info if not? Dude this is BLIZZARD we're talking about; a MASSIVE company. Do you understand extremely basic law and that they're not just somebody's parents saying &quot;Don't take another bite of that ice cream mister!&quot;?<br />
&quot;Sticking it to the man&quot; doesn't exactly fit when that man will take everything you have, break your kneecaps and walk away laughing.<br />

<br />
I really hope this isn't your new philosophy going forward or I guess I'll have to find another place to get WoW news.<br />
<br />
<br />
LOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOLOL. What are you, 10? Because you have no grip on the real world and what people think/care about. You, are one person, this site, has millions. If you leave elsewhere, 10 more will join in your place. This is the exact same as my favorite WoW threat &quot;BLIZZ IF YOU DON'T BUFF MY CLASS/REVERT THESE CHANGES I'LL QUIT&quot;...seriously, think about what you're saying. Also, this is the best site for WoW news and you know it. Like WoW, you're e-addicted and you won't stop coming to this site as long as you play the game, so don't lie.<br />
<br />
Boub, you do an awesome job with this site and taking down the info was all but expected. Thanks for taking the risk to share what you did it was extremely well appreciated by all who got the chance to see it.<br />

It's not and wasn't illegal for anyone who didn't sign the nda (and even then, i'm not sure the term 'illegal' applies, but I'm not a Lawyer).<br />
<br />
Also stealing and murder are against the law, downloading an alpha for a computer game is not.</div></div><hr />

When Boub posted new stuff, he also let everybody else post stuff.

And in doing so, he took down everything he posted himslef aswell as everything posted by others. No hypocrisy - the lay of the land changed: Blizz actually took the time to ask him not to post or host that stuff here. Before they did Boub posted and allowed others to post, after he stoped posting and made it a bannable offense to post stuff, and took down everything that had been posted so far.</div></div><hr />

Same rules apply when you download any un-authorised content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard really gave a shit when people downloaded the Alpha client for Burning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King and everyone made private servers, didn't they? <br />
<br />
Again, go away. Go QQ on the WoW forums like everyone else, hoping that your posts attract some Blue's attention and they reward you with an Alpha key for your &quot;service&quot;.</div></div><hr />

It's not theft and you would not be charged with a criminal offence. Blizzard would have to sue you for copyright infringement and it would go through a civil court.<br />

The people who actually STOLE it and placed it on the internet would be trouble there. Someone who just posted scenes or used it, nah. Even then blizz would actually have to you know enforce it, they won't. Most big companies won't because it cost them more than they are likely to get from it. They basically just send someone a letter from their lawyers hope that scares them. If it does they get their way. If it doesn't they won't go to the next step anyways.</div></div><hr />

Once again, they didn't care at all when this exact same thing happened with WOTLK and BC. Sites were forced to remove some content and were threatened by Blizzard, sure, but nobody got taken to court, assassinated, or labeled a hideous criminal like you're saying everyone on this forum is. Blizzard realizes these leaks generate hype for the game, and they also realize that there's an enormous amount of people emulating/sandboxing/private servering the Alpha, and so they won't waste their time or money seeking legal action.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And what the hell are you, their personal referee? <br />
<br />
There were several sites that hosted links to the Alpha client for WOTLK, and had forums dedicated to private servers for the Alpha, and the same went for the beta. These sites weren't taken down and their links weren't removed, and it was only when Wrath launched that these sites took their stuff down. <br />
<br />
And the fact that nobody on the interwebs made a big deal about &quot;x&quot; site getting sued for posting leaked info is enough of a reason to assume that nobody got sued.</div></div><hr />

Nope, me neither. It's because we can take these things with a grain of contextual salt.

<br />
They can't stop leaks on the internet, but mmo-champion is a very well known site. Having leaks on, say, SA's members-only forums and having leaks on mmo-champion's front page are two extremely different things.<br />
<br />
Plus the reason for an NDA is clear when you see Blizzard's tweets about the new screenshot of the day and all that nonsense. They have the right as Cataclysm's creators to be the ones to show everyone their hard work first. You may want to see everything first as the player, sure, but from a development standpoint, mmo-champion and everyone else posting leaks is taking that away from them.<br />

It makes perfect sense. NDAs do nothing if they company issuing them doesn't actually enforce by sueing. No big company is going to sue a fansite WEB master. It would cost them more money in the long run. The reason you'd hear about it is because it would set a huge precedent since it's not like it happens everyday. NDAs aren't even enforceable in some countries. It's the same with a TOS. TOS' generally mean and do jack as it's not held up in court very often or at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As much as I appreciate WoW's hyper-active player community and the exchange of ideas between Blizzard, fan sites and players, sometimes I think there's just too much information put out there. I have a hard time seeing how it really helps Blizzard when virtually every new bit of information or &quot;blue&quot; post spawns a million+1 QQ threads. 99% of these threads are based on incomplete information or speculation about things that may or may never come to pass. <br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">chorx</div><div class="date">2010-05-12, 01:29 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Love the &quot;NDA doesn't stop anything, wah wah leaks are still all over the internet, taking them off mmo-champion does nothing&quot; nonsense.<br />
<br />
They can't stop leaks on the internet, but mmo-champion is a very well known site. Having leaks on, say, SA's members-only forums and having leaks on mmo-champion's front page are two extremely different things.<br />
<br />
Plus the reason for an NDA is clear when you see Blizzard's tweets about the new screenshot of the day and all that nonsense. They have the right as Cataclysm's creators to be the ones to show everyone their hard work first. You may want to see everything first as the player, sure, but from a development standpoint, mmo-champion and everyone else posting leaks is taking that away from them.<br />
<br />
If you worked hard for a couple years writing a book, you wouldn't want people getting their hands on it and telling the entire internet what happens in the story before you can finish writing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet that moderating alpha content here is purely an act of kindness, and respect towards blizzard.</div></div><hr />

The opposite is very true too. You know when a game gets a less then successful launch? How many people say they will sue? How many do? How many are successful?</div></div><hr />

thats it exactly! They want things to be a surprise rather then having half the content discovered and shown to the mass publics before content is even released to the mass public. It takes away half the fun. I can completely understand where they are coming from and im surprised they hadn't done it ealier. That said, i am happy to have seen one specific part which i look forward to learning more of when the content is released :)</div></div><hr />

I'm sure he's already considered this. He's made his choice, and it's time for the people who care about Alpha info to find a new site until the Beta begins. Personally, I don't think I'll ever have the same level of respect for this site again, but that's just me.<br />

yea i agree. i think its funny that the only ppl that seem so angry are the ppl that have a generally low post count, which would probably mean they either come to the site to get as many spoilers as they can and never really participate in the community of this site, or just ppl that just always want to complain about anything blizz does.
