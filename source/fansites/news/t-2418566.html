I also want to throw out a reminder that you all have a week to go before the pre patch events are removed from the game and as such the mounts, Teldrassil Hippogryph and the Undercity Plaguebat for the Alliance and Horde respectively, will be no longer attainable.

Yes I'm sure the game is &quot;bleeding subs&quot; because they decided a requirement was idiotic and changed it to benefit players.... :rolleyes:<br />

This just proves my point people will use literally anything Blizzard related to go at them with pitchforks. Even if it's a beneficial change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh I like what they did with Sylvanas personally. I feel like with the story these days they are pushing it a bit more to the extreme. Although I wonder what this means for the Horde because last time this happened Varian told them if it did again that &quot;we will end you&quot;.<br />
<br />
I mean it's nice they removed this requirement because it was a silly one even before all this kicked off. Bit of a generosity move on their part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How does this piss anyone off? It's beneficial no matter what. Plus you can just refund if you literally only prepurchased for this one singular event as long as you haven't used the 110 boost or unlocked an Allied Race. Which I somehow doubt.<br />
<br />
When the pre purchase was up months ago nobody knew that this event was gonna be part of it because they hadn't said anything back then.<br />
<br />
It's more than likely that people who prepurchased did so ages ago if they knew they were going to be playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah how dare they let everyone experience it! So callous of them.:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
They are not removing it. They are just letting everyone experience it regardless. It was a stupid pre purchase bonus anyway and only strung together recently. BFA already has incentive on the usual free boost and Allied Races.<br />
<br />
And I severely doubt this close to launch people were pre purchasing for one single event.</div></div><hr />

In fact, I thought the Battle for Lordaeron was going to be available for everyone, as it's BFA's version of the Broken Shore essentially. I pre-ordered BFA myself and I could care less about this change. It's just a preview of the expansion, after all, or that is at least how I view it.</div></div><hr />

Everyone can experience it on BfA release. Playing that scenario a week earlier was an exclusive pre order bonus.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And now it's not. Deal with it. You had plenty of bonuses from preordering and even Blizzard realised it was a silly one to make people who didn't prepurchase be left in the lurch for a week while others get to experience it. Not to mention the criticism being thrown their way by some players for the story as quite a fair few don't agree with it. It's them extending an olive branch on a minor thing. Nothing else.<br />
<br />
They can freely change it before the events launch date. There is nothing stopping them. And they chose to. <br />
<br />
I remember another game (for the life of me I can't remember which) did something similar and everyone were praising them and the devs for it as if they were gods and the greatest people in the world for their generosity.<br />
<br />
Here though because it's Blizzard people are all &quot;REEE ULTERIOR MOTIVE/BLEEDING SUBS&quot;. I find it amusing personally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair I highly doubt people were preordering just for this when there were Allied Races and the free boost.<br />
<br />
I mean for one single event imo seems a bit far fetched. But them again they could have done. But with how soon this is to launch I highly doubt it's a sizeable majority who did.<br />

<br />
<br />
That seems kind of an odd move...wasn't it advertised as exclusive content if you prepurchased? Now they just made it available for everyone &quot;early&quot;?<br />
<br />
Yes. However they are allowed to change that criteria before the event goes live.<br />
<br />
Which they did. It's just 1 small event at the end of the day and it's better than leaving those on the fence or still debating whether to get it in the lurch for a week. And if anything will make that small chunk more than likely to get it.</div></div><hr />

I pre-ordered the expac and ordered a CE. Why should I be fussed? Only reason I pre-ordered was to get a headstart on my allied dudes and I could apply the CE code to have the pre-order price returned to me in Blizzbucks.<br />
<br />
I ordered the CE because I like the physical goodies and already have the other CEs. Don't care about anyone else getting the stories now, that means I can read them before BFA as well, kind of how it should be :p<br />

I really think people are just looking for a reason to cry. It's only a game, why you heff to be mad?</div></div><hr />

What are you basing this one?<br />
Pre-patch is still 8.x content, so to me it seems logical to include it in the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Pre-patch is still 8.x content, so to me it seems logical to include it in the expansion.<br />
<br />
Right now this is the systems patch to prepare for when it goes live next week. Pre expansion content is content before the expansion launches. That is what the War of Thorns is. Not expansion content per se but content that starts the arc that builds into the launch on the 14th.<br />
<br />
Also did Legions pre patch make you pre-order to do invasions? No.<br />
<br />
Did WoD for the Iron Horde Invasion? No<br />
<br />
Did Cata for the Elemental/twilight stuff?<br />
<br />
Did Wrath for the zombie invasion?<br />
<br />
You get my point? Yes this was initially meant to be a pre order bonus by letting people get in 1 week early but again even Blizzard realised it was silly leaving some people in the lurch for a week. Therefore quickly reverted the change.<br />
<br />
And again I highly doubt this 1 5 minute scenario is why the majority of people preordered. If anything the fair chunk of preorders would have been done when they went live months ago. Back then all that was known was you got the boost and Allied Races.</div></div><hr />

Doing something like this strictly rewards players who pre-ordered the game through Blizzad.

Ah, that bothers me less then. Hard to remember where all the information comes from.<br />

If Blizzard had advertised a pre-order feature and then pulled it after most pre-orders were already sold I'd be a bit shocked at such poor practice, but I'm not going to blame Ion too hard for making a mistake during a Q&amp;A.</div></div><hr />

This has nothing to do with lazy, but many people don't like to preorder videogames and get their key just right before launch, when this will be removed.<br />

Yea, they do that on occasion, i mean, it's &quot;technically&quot; and expansion feature... I guess... in some minor way lol.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">xcitng</div><div class="date">2018-08-06, 10:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right now this is the systems patch to prepare for when it goes live next week. Pre expansion content is content before the expansion launches. That is what the War of Thorns is. Not expansion content per se but content that starts the arc that builds into the launch on the 14th.<br />
<br />
Also did Legions pre patch make you pre-order to do invasions? No.<br />
<br />
Did WoD for the Iron Horde Invasion? No<br />
<br />
Did Cata for the Elemental/twilight stuff?<br />
<br />
Did Wrath for the zombie invasion?<br />
<br />
You get my point? Yes this was initially meant to be a pre order bonus by letting people get in 1 week early but again even Blizzard realised it was silly leaving some people in the lurch for a week. Therefore quickly reverted the change.<br />
<br />
And again I highly doubt this 1 5 minute scenario is why the majority of people preordered. If anything the fair chunk of preorders would have been done when they went live months ago. Back then all that was known was you got the boost and Allied Races.<br />
<br />

Yeah yeah I know. Dare to debate someone who takes a positive change and makes it out to be negative and you are &quot;white knighting&quot;. Maybe read one or two of my posts about BFA before pulling that card. I'm fairly sceptical of some of the things coming in this expansion.<br />
<br />
But whatever you say buddy. This change is a good one. It not only benefits those who don't preorder it also benefits those who bought Physical copies such as CE's in which you don't get the key until launch night. <br />
<br />
There is zero downside to this. People complaining about it are those who just complain for the sake of it no matter what this company does. They are the kind of people who could get a free mount, pet and copy of BFA from Blizzard and they would still find someway to spin it to fit their negative nancy narrative.<br />
<br />
Criticism is fine. Posting &quot;bleeding subs&quot; or &quot;game must be dying if they need to do this&quot; as some people have done isn't criticism. It's just taking a positive change and again spinning it to fit their narrative of &quot;Blizzard da bad guys&quot;. I'd be impressed if someone actually found some actual critique to this change. Because it literally benefits everyone.<br />

<br />
It was announced around 4 weeks or so ago in a Q and A. Then they realised that putting pre expansion content on early access was an idiotic move and reverted the change so it benefits everyone especially those unable to obtain there codes until the 14th but still pre purchased.<br />
<br />
This was something done at last minute and then reverted because it was a silly move since this essentially continues on from the current pre expansion event which doesn't require purchasing BFA. Unlike Allied Races and the boost which was intended to be in the pre purchase from the start. <br />
<br />
It benefits everyone. Saying &quot;this is no longer a part of the prepurchase anymore&quot; isn't criticism. It's stating the obvious.<br />

Not really. Some people will enjoy it and some won't. Like every expansion. All you are doing now is trying to say something is objectively bad based on your own opinion. Your opinion of BFA however is subjective.<br />

Yeah no. I highly doubt people preordered just for a 10 minute event considering the idea of it being gated like that was only toyed with a few weeks ago.<br />
<br />
I'll find it hard to believe anyone who claims they preordered just for that event personally when there are 2 even bigger bonuses when the preorders went up months ago.</div></div><hr />

No laws were broken. They have every right to change that before the event happens considering the circumstances of it's announcement. But feel free to take them to court over it if you feel so. <br />
<br />
It was a stitched together thing a few weeks ago. It was NOT part of the original preorder. Nor was the Battle advertised as &quot;pre purchase only&quot;. It was early access for pre purchases which was a dumb move because it left people who can't get keys until launch night unable to do the scenario until then despite pre purchasing. Why should people who want a physical copy be screwed out of doing the scenario?<br />
<br />
Also pre patch events have been like that since BC where they were limited time events. So are you saying they've had that attitude since BC? They've been removing content since Vanilla or doing limited time content. It's nothing new dude.</div></div><hr />

No. Pre purchasers got early access to the Battle for Lordaeron scenario. Thankfully they came to their sense on that and reverted the idea.</div></div><hr />

No, they just mentioned maybe doing the Battle for Prepurchases a week early, never even confirmed it.</div></div><hr />

It was a QnA where he said &quot;we're thinking about doing the Battle a week early for prepurchasers&quot;, but never a definite until it was the opposite. Anyone who's been around more then an expansion knows blizzard doesn't speak in guarantees til the last second.</div></div><hr />

But nooo, you just have to be a bunch of salty bastards...<br />
<br />
If Blizzard had advertised something as a pre-order benefit and then yanked it a week before launch then I think that's a pretty fair reason to be upset. It's just dishonest marketing.<br />
<br />
That said, they didn't promise it - but I know I originally thought they had, hard to remember where everything you read comes from. <br />
Chalking (misplaced) annoyance at dishonest marketing up as being &quot;salty bastards&quot; is silly though, it's a perfectly valid reason to be upset and companies shouldn't be able to get away with lying to customers without backlash.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
It's not that bad this time, Blizzard have FINALLY went back to the old model where if you order a physical CE you can also just buy a digital copy of the game and then get a refund (admittedly in bnet balance, but that converts into sub time which seems fair enough).<br />
The last few expansions where they just unbound a useless key were disgusting and essentially &quot;punished&quot; the biggest fans who bought the expensive physical CE by making them either buy the game twice or not play on launch until whenever their post turned up.<br />
<br />
Nice to see they've come to their senses over that, especially considering back in MOP I think it was, they had this EXACT same policy and then just stopped doing it for WOD / Legion.</div></div><hr />

For every other upcoming release, people are screaming &quot;get rid of Pre-Order Bonuses&quot; and purchase it for the game and game alone - They remove (a stupid) exclusive Pre Order Bonus that comes with BfA in favor of letting everyone play it, BfA or not, and everyone is up in arms...

It's like different people having different oppinions. Sorry but the same people who are against pre-order-bonuses who weren't happy about it aren't the people now who complains pro pre-order-bonuses. But i'm happy that people who didn't bought bfa to get at least an insight how bad bfa is and encourage them not to buy this crappy expansion!</div></div><hr />

Jesus christ. This has to be the best one yet. Way better than the &quot;bleeding subs&quot; or &quot;desperation&quot; comments.<br />
<br />
No you fucking didn't. You paid for a boost and Allied Races. They mentioned &quot;the possibility&quot; of doing that for the prepatch. They are free to go back on that as they never set it in concrete and never added it to the BFA preorder page. Just like they can easily postpone the BFA launch if a critical issue arises that prevents the expansion from being able to be released.<br />
<br />
But by all means sue them. Watch a judge laugh you out of court if you really want that. Because you have absolutely nothing to go on.<br />
<br />
Hey if you want just for the extra shits and giggles you could try and get them under a RICO and claim they are a criminal organisation. I mean the way you are going on about this along with a few others on the forums you make them out to be one at this point.<br />
<br />
Dishonest marketing would have only occurred had they 100% stated that the pre patch event this week would be early access for BFA preorders. They made a minor implication that they were free to revoke.</div></div><hr />

To use his gold bars analogy it's more like Blizzard put gold bars up for sale and promised a free bar of candy next week to everyone who purchases before the end of the week, then decided to give out a bar of free candy to everyone who turned up at the &quot;gold bar store&quot; that day instead of just the people who purchased.<br />

Key word in that sentence. THINKING. So it was never set in stone but just put forward as a possible idea. They were thinking of doing it and then changed their minds. So they weren't dishonest, didn't lie or deceive. Good to know that the people spouting those lines were wrong then.<br />
<br />
Also considering how close to BFA it was mentioned I highly doubt pre purchasers were coming in droves to play a quick scenario. That quote about &quot;mustering for war&quot; implies a small thing at the start of BFA as well. <br />
<br />
However Broken Shore didn't require a Legion prepurchase.<br />
<br />
Things change. If a scenario change so that everyone can do it has people this rattled then they need to re-evaluate their priorities imo.</div></div><hr />

It wouldn't be dishonest if Ion himself stepped forward and openly said :&quot;I changed my mind&quot;. That would be honest. <br />
Key words for me that Pr-patch finishes with burning the tree. Anything after is BfA. So if they changed their mind, an honest thing to do would be just to move scenario to launch. And not in the way &quot;we're thinking of giving a little bit extra on top for those who already bought BfA. Nah, fuck that, everyone is considered special, we can't do that&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's not about scenario change, it's a continuation of reaction on a large number of backstabs from Blizz after intro cinematic hype.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Backstabs&quot;? Dude they aren't your best friend there to cuddle you every time you find something you dislike about the game that others may not.<br />
<br />
It's a damn scenario. They not once stated 100% that the Battle would be guaranteed for pre purchases and were thinking about it. <br />
<br />
And how do you know it wasn't Ion who changed it? It's a blue post from a CM. The only place they could have gotten that info is from the dev team. And who has the final say on changes to the game?<br />
<br />
So yes I'll stick with my opinion of people are complaining for the sake of it rather than seeing this as good thing benefiting everyone rather than a select bunch of people. And that I won't believe anyone who says they pre purchased this for a 10 minute scenario that was only announced as an idea 4 or so weeks ago and was then scrapped because it was a stupid idea.</div></div><hr />

Well the devs clearly disagree with you on that one otherwise it wouldn't be available until next week for everyone rather than people who threw their money at them first.<br />
<br />
They made a good change. This helps those unable to receive their codes until next week which is still an occurrence. <br />
<br />
People can parrot on about how they are &quot;oh so evil&quot; or what really got me laughing was the &quot;they should be sued&quot; line but at the end of the day this is a beneficial change.<br />
<br />
The only other option was not letting anyone see it until next week and that would have been even more idiotic than restricting it to pre purchasers.<br />
<br />
There were a good chunk of incentives to preorder BFA. This one was not one of them. It was announced as an idea too close to the expansion to affect pre sales in any major matter. People who wanted to pre purchase will have done so already before this.</div></div><hr />

Quick glance through your posts in this thread shows that you keep spamming same argument over and over, playing devil's advocate.<br />
<br />
First, I at no point discussed whether it was a good idea or not, only thath BfU is a BfA content, same as the other scenarios required to advance through the respective exapnsions. So why more of this spam which has nothing to do with my post?<br />
<br />
Second, it's not about whether it was a good idea or not, but about the false marketing. Yeah, they changed their mind 1 day before realizing the action planned and communicated long ago. Idc about the fact people who didnt prepurchase get to play it (although if they wanted everyone to have the same access to it, they should have waited with it until BfA release, like other introductory scenarios), but how volatile their marketing is and how little their word actually matters. Imagine their marketing was &quot;who buys the prepurchase will get additional level boost&quot; then one day before release they say &quot;you know what, we changed our mind, everyone who buys BfA no matter when, will get additional level boost, we changed our mind cause we can LUL&quot; - there would be a huge shitstorm.<br />
<br />
Next time they should think twice about what they state or dont make any marketing promises at all. Changing it, and doing it literally one day before said promise going to live, makes them unprofessional and not trustworthy. Of course I'm saying all that having studied a bit of basics of marketing in college, so my opinion may vary from someone who can only think about their gains and has no clue how things work globally.</div></div><hr />

They never made a marketing promise. They said they were thinking about it. Try again. I highly doubt your experience in marketing personally if you take &quot;we are thinking&quot; as a marketing promise.<br />
<br />
You people all seem hung up on the word &quot;promise&quot; when no fucking game company does that. Because it would get them into a lot of hot water doing so. Kind of like No Man's Sky did early on for example.<br />
<br />
So it's wrong for me to use the same debate point but ok for people to use the tired old crap of &quot;HURR GAME DYING&quot;, &quot;Trash tier move&quot;, &quot;I'm gonna sue them&quot; and other stuff they use to pretty much be a negative nancy? Yeah not how that works.<br />

You say &quot;We shall endeavour...&quot;, &quot;We will try our best...&quot;, &quot;We will do what we can...&quot;, but you *never* promise, and you seem to think, Blizzard, a major company with a HUGE PR team and tone of voice section (where any blue posters have to get coached on what to say, and how to say it), and any public press releases are finely checked for any legal ramifications or inference of something that may leave them liable to be prosecuted (Thanks USA for opening the way for BS lawsuits...)<br />

Side note, who the flying feck cares about a 10mins scenario you will play a couple of times before being bored with it? <br />
Now, if they released the first zone of the expansion, and the first 2 levels to people who hadn't purchased it as a way to entice subs, then you would have an argument (both for the nonsense &quot;bleeding subs&quot;, and &quot;Muh promises!&quot; brigades), but this is simply finished a storyline.<br />

Honestly peeps, take a step back, look what you are literally whining about, and just realise it is hilariously childish.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Apolyc</div><div class="date">2018-08-07, 11:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont understand the issue here. Are you really stomping your feet and getting pissy because you arent a special snowflake anymore? And what about people who DID pre-order but not a digital copy? I personally pre-ordered a physical copy of the game. It is a pre-order, but because it isnt digital i dont have a code so technically before i wouldnt have been able to play the scenario early. Now i can, i dont care that i can its just a bonus for me.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CasualNoob</div><div class="date">2018-08-07, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">its a required scenario which the begining of BfA and you need to do it (probably only once like with Broken Shore) to advance to Kul Tiras / Zandalar. Nope. For advance to Kul Tiras / Zandalar there are other scenario. Infiltration in Stormwind for horde.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daefish</div><div class="date">2018-08-07, 11:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Quick glance through your posts in this thread shows that you keep spamming same argument over and over, playing devil's advocate.<br />
<br />
First, I at no point discussed whether it was a good idea or not, only thath BfU is a BfA content, same as the other scenarios required to advance through the respective exapnsions. So why more of this spam which has nothing to do with my post?<br />
<br />
Second, it's not about whether it was a good idea or not, but about the false marketing. Yeah, they changed their mind 1 day before realizing the action planned and communicated long ago. Idc about the fact people who didnt prepurchase get to play it (although if they wanted everyone to have the same access to it, they should have waited with it until BfA release, like other introductory scenarios), but how volatile their marketing is and how little their word actually matters. Imagine their marketing was &quot;who buys the prepurchase will get additional level boost&quot; then one day before release they say &quot;you know what, we changed our mind, everyone who buys BfA no matter when, will get additional level boost, we changed our mind cause we can LUL&quot; - there would be a huge shitstorm.<br />
<br />
Next time they should think twice about what they state or dont make any marketing promises at all. Changing it, and doing it literally one day before said promise going to live, makes them unprofessional and not trustworthy. Of course I'm saying all that having studied a bit of basics of marketing in college, so my opinion may vary from someone who can only think about their gains and has no clue how things work globally.<br />
<br />
I'm sure the next time Blizzard wants to make changes, they'll consult you and your vast depth of wisdom and eloquence first.</div></div><hr />

<br />
but this move will only turn away more people from game now that blizzard cheated them into thinking they will get early access as bonus to preorder.<br />
<br />
this is proving that game is nearly dead if they break their own promises.<br />
<br />
people should imidiately cancel their preorders and demand refunds to show blizzard such actions are not welcome.</div></div><hr />

Hey, another idiot!<br />
<br />
p.s. it’s literally less than a week until this game comes out, so it’s not like it’s months in advance. The scenario wasn’t a selling point, like Allied Races, for the pre-order. Nobody’s been mislead. It would have simply been an added bonus for having pre-ordered it, nothing more.</div></div><hr />

Yeah safe to say you shouldn't be taken seriously now especially considering evidence that disproves you has been shown so off to ignore you go.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like some other parts of the site as well and like checking out news in hope something good happens and the game is worth subscribing again. I would be more worried with people that put up with the crap blizzard had been shoving down their throats in the past years.</div></div><hr />

Yea i did my invasions without having bought the expansion yet</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ah, really? Well guess I am back to waiting another reason then. Thought it was something epic, the whole quest, the burning and the battle for Undercity. Also do we get anything if we resubscribe? A boost to level 110 or something? Otherwise it wouldn't be worth as well, wouldn't be able to catch to 110 in a week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get a 110 boost and access to unlock Allied Races which require 110 of each faction since one set is Alliance and the other Horde.<br />
<br />
Allied Races also require exalted with the respective factions and in Nightbornes case to have finished their story which you can do now freely since they removed the reputation gates for completing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting, a boost to 110 would be the only way to enjoy the event but if the main battle only take 5 minutes its a letdown. But thanks for the info! Very kind of you.</div></div><hr />

Eh to be fair they lowered the cap on them recently. Lot of Low ones on ours went to Medium/High.<br />
<br />
At a guess they are probably doing work on the servers ready for launch.<br />
<br />
Saurfang for example over here in EU was Low until recently. Now it's shot up to Medium/High and it hasn't been that since the server cap increase.<br />
<br />
Just a guess anyway. But dude people have been parroting on for 12 years that the game is dying/dead. They don't know the meaning of that word.</div></div><hr />

hopefully the death of many many horde.</div></div><hr />

as someone who used to play on that server - it was already dead like f.... back in cata -_- if its now considered medium/high now, then lol how badly blizzard must falsify the amount of people playing on it.</div></div><hr />

lol, as a horde who ain't fighting Sylvanus's war, go right ahead!<br />
<br />
Really though, I meant was there anything like Transmog, mounts, or anything else collectable.</div></div><hr />

Couple of mounts. The armor sets are just the ones boosted toons get or the WoD Garrison salvage crate stuff.<br />
<br />
Undercity Plaguebat is nice but Teldrassil Hippogryph is meh.</div></div><hr />

I did buy the expansion but my code arrives on the 13th, by that time the pre event is probably over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Already got the mounts, and if the gear is stuff I got from Salvage crates, there's really no need.<br />
<br />
This prepatch really IS underwhelming. Personally, I feel the Legion Prepatch was WAY more exciting. I played during that one every day, catching every single invasion and got all the transmog, pets and toys.<br />
<br />
This prepatch? Meh, done it once and its already boring as shit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And I prepurchased the day BFA back in December ... the CE version as soon as it was advertised by ebgames and WELL before Blizzard offered it. And yet I would not have access to it.<br />
