<br />
<br />
Patch 4.3 - The New Darkmoon Faire is on Test Realms!<br />
It's the first week-end of the month and it means the new Darkmoon Faire is finally available for testing! The new faire is much much bigger than the old one and now has its own dedicated zone, you can enter it through the portals located in the old locations of the Darkmoon Faire (Goldshire, Thunder Bluff, etc ...) <br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;700&quot; height=&quot;455&quot; src=&quot;http://www.youtube.com/embed/15a27LYvqhw&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Upon entering the faire, you will be able to buy a Pouch o' Tokens (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78904/pouch-o-tokens/) or a Sack o' Tokens (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78910/sack-o-tokens/) for a reasonable price, these tokens are used to play all the games of the Darkmoon Faire. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
More activities are now offered and on the test realms you can currently try: <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A target shooting game where you have to score 25 points in 60 seconds. <br />
The &quot;Tonk Commander&quot; game, where you have to shoot 30 targets with your Tonk in a set amount of time. <br />
A ring tossing game, the goal is to toss rings on the turtle in the playing area. <br />
The Darkmoon Cannon is still here, and will require you to trigger a skill while you fly to land and hit a target on the ground/water. <br />
The new &quot;Whack-a-gnoll&quot; mini-game will let you test your reflexes and ... well, whack gnolls. <br />
The Darkmoon Deathmatch Arena, the name pretty much says it all. Any player entering the Arena will be flagged for PvP and able to fight any other players already there. <br />
Profession quests, rewarding you with tickets and a +5 bonus to your profession skill. <br />
Last but not least, L90ETC gives a concert every hour! <br />
<br />
<br />
You can also just walk around the faire and spend your money to buy fireworks or even a balloon from the Balloon Vendor. The faire even has its own zoo with a nice sample of creatures from all over Azeroth on display!<br />
<br />
These games will reward you with Darkmoon Prize Ticket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71970/darkmoon-prize-ticket/) and after collecting enough of them, you will be able to buy rewards from the Darkmoon Faire vendors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rewards - Tier 0/Dungeon Set Armor Replica<br />
The very first class armor sets from the old level 60 5-man dungeons are back in the game, or at least replicas of them are back and you can buy them for Transmogrification purposes! The items do not have any stats (Replica Deathmist Robe (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78237/replica-deathmist-robe/)) and are only here to let you get that look when you transmogrify your gear. <br />
<br />
I could let most of you roam the internet to figure out how your armor set looks but I'm much nicer than that, here's a compilation! (Warlock Deathmist helm currently bugged)<br />

Looking at the video - the dailys ARE, in fact, giving darkmoon rep! <br />
<br />
Although I'm not sure what the rep status of that person was at DMF to begin with in the video.</div></div><hr />

They probably don't want rogues the stab you on the your way to whack-a-gnoll. A giant group of one faction could also block the path by killing everyone trying to get past.</div></div><hr />

Dungeon Set 1 and 2, weren't all that pretty, unless you go for Valor. But the main pieces were ruined because of the BOA graphics. If they were to bring in other tiers (t3 maybe), or made it easier to gain T1-10 through these venders, i would of worked towards it. Saves loosing that token to some random pug, so you could just go buy the piece you want from weeks of work.I will check out the faire, but i'm slightly disapointed by the lack of rewards (2 mounts, 6 pets, gear i don't find appealing).Hopefully after the release, they introduce more armor pieces to the vendor.</div></div><hr />

Only one week per month.....meh would be cooler if it was on ALL THE TIME instead of just one week per month :S<br />
No no no, it would just make it another &quot;daily for a month&quot; quest zone. But with Darkmoon Faire coming only for a week, you'll surely be waiting eagerly for it. Better &quot;Oh gosh it's so cool, what a pity that it is on only for a 7 days&quot; than &quot;all right, 10 dailies for another 20 days and I will get all I need and get the hell outta here.

To all the people saying it nerfs the Insane a lot... just no. DMF rep wasn't even difficult to get in the first place, you just needed a lot of gold/good server deck prices, these dailies are only around a week per month, it isn't like you'll be exalted in 1 day it will still take quite a while. With the buffed goblin/bloodsail reps it's only slightly easier in the end and ravenholdt still holds a challenge for those wanting one.</div></div><hr />

It looks like 285 is correct, if this stays true it's still going to take 4 months to collect enough tickets to ONLY purchase the pets, and both mounts. While I understand the need to draw out the faire for &quot;content&quot; purposes, not giving any kind of hat tip to those who have been exalted when them pre 4.3 is just a joke.</div></div><hr />

From scratch or were you already part way there? They should retire the achievement and add a new one for the people who missed it with an equally grueling grind, it's not the same achievement anymore.<br />

Let's hope not. People can already use tier 7 if they like the look so much. If they want tier 3 because it's so unique, guess what. If you could buy it from DMF it stops being unique instantly.</div></div><hr />

No, but part of the reason people do them is because they are hard to do. We have already done them, and you want to take that away from us? I think you're the one who's selfish.<br />

No, it's &quot;This person gets the same reward for significantly less effort, despite the original route still being in the game&quot;, removing the Dire Maul faction was bad enough, but kind of understandable if it didn't fit with Cataclysm content. Darkmoon Cards haven't been removed from the game.<br />

<br />
Some of us who put many hours into the Insane title are looking forward to seeing others finally catch up ;)<br />
<br />
Also bringing back armor sets etc is a cool idea, but why not have tiny coloration changes like they did with the Amani War Bear revamp? I don't have an original one, only the Cata one - and I'm cool with that. I understand it would piss off the people who got it back in the day if I could just waltz into a revamped heroic and grab it now.<br />
<br />
But hey, there are millions of different opinions in the WoW community I guess, and on the whole I think Blizzard do a pretty good job of keeping the majority happy. <br />

Still want Agent of Shen'dralar to be a title tho :p</div></div><hr />

I think this is something players have been asking for for a long time. It's a good move, IMO.<br />

You do know that some of the Tier 7 sets were the original sets with updated textures right? More so it was true for the Paladin gear, I don't remember which of the other sets got the same treatment. Just goes to show you how lazy Blizzard was, and still is. There isn't any compensation set for Death Knights, so once again, the class gets a nice turd in the face from the developers for not even creating anything for us.</div></div><hr />

Odds are they wont put T3 in game because those T13 previews they have been putting out says T3 doesn't even exist. &quot;Your T3 is now T7 hur hur&quot;<br />
<br />
As for DMF, I am disappointed with the rewards. There are several area's &quot;under construction. keep out&quot;, which might hold more rewards.. or complete wastes of space that will never have anything in them at all. Regardless, the vendor for the armors is clumsy. You have to go through every set and not just pick the set you want.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The previous method which was largely reliant on the market for a crafting rather than effort or skill was a damn sight worse than this one.<br />
At least this one is earned solely by the player and not reliant on other players for selling/trading and profession crafting.<br />
<br />
If anything it could be a slower way to gain rep due to the limited one week duration of the faire in any given month, so don't go complaining about an alternative when you are putting in no thought whatsoever as to the reasons or consequences of it.</div></div><hr />

Your previous post was bitching about Blizz putting the replicas in the game AT ALL! Which meant you didn't care if they got rid of it or not! Connecting the dots on your intentions and your backpedaling the second you got called on it is not that hard to do!<br />
<br />
And you were &quot;special&quot;, like, 5 or 6 years ago. Want to be &quot;special&quot; again? Go kill Heroic DW when 4.3 drops? Seriously, you and others are bitching about tier sets that are 6 years old now and, for some of those, unable to be had in the game anymore any other way. They've been outdated for years and people just keep it for the lulz now, if at all. Get over yourself!</div></div><hr />

No, my point is that the darkmoon quests STILL might not give rep past honored even in 4.3, and you'll still have to farm. Read for content, not satisfaction.<br />

Sure, a lot of people think its not as legit, but if you were a top raider you could have easily gotten your guild to let you turn in all the decks they were going to. Anyone else notice that the top raiding guilds were some of the first with members to get the Achievement? Frankly, I could have gotten exalted with DMF (currently honored with them, and have Everlook at 17000/21000, then I get it), but I enjoy having my FoS for Exalted with Shen'dralar. And I did the math. For me, working from 1200/12000 with DMF, it would take 4 Faires to get to Exalted. for someone at neutral, it will take 5 faires. That's 5 months. about the same amount of time to get the cards, if you are doing it all by yourself and not buying extras or mats.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I'd also like to add that I leveled a rogue I got to 30 when I was playing around with the classes all the way to 58 just to farm Heavy Junkboxes for a 2 months. And getting 85 Pristine Black Diamonds is a hell of a lot harder than 110 DMF Decks.</div></div><hr />

Get over yourselves I say, everyone knows that you only have bragging rights for achievements - if you finished them within a certain timeframe. Just like with, for example the ulduar achievement drakes - everyone and their mother got them now. But it's only those who got them before nerfs where made etc that can really brag about them. Or an extreme example, you could feel awesome for raiding and taking down ragnaros back in molten core in classic. But now people can solo the bastard, so yeah. Things change, they get easier.

Well the new DMF and the fact that you can gain rep through questing and what not has been known for many months. So, you should have stopped months ago. Then again, it's not a total loss for you. Sell what you turn in. It adds up gold wise. Never a bad thing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ILjXYZ</div><div class="date">2011-11-07, 12:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So, I am trying to figure out exactly how much reputation you can gain from the Darkmoon Faire quests. Unfortunately, the PTR download is painfully slow so I am hoping to employ some help from someone who happens to already be on the PTR.<br />
<br />
There are 4 daily quests listed on the front page here, each of which grant 250 Darkmoon Faire reputation when completed. This results in a total 7,000 (1,000 x 7 days) reputation every month from these quests alone. Assuming the Test Your Strength quest is non-repeatable and the profession quests are non-repeatable, completing these quests would grant an additional 1,750 reputation. Finally, from reading the description of the Darkmoon Field Guide on Wowhead I'm further assuming that only 1 artifact can be turned in per month for 250 reputation.<br />
<br />
If my numbers are correct (and they might not be based on the number of assumptions made) a total of 9,000 reputation can be gained every month from the Darkmoon Faire quests. For a character starting at 0/3000 Neutral standing with Darkmoon Faire it will take 5 months (42,000 total rep needed \ 9,000 reputation a month) to gain exalted status without ever turning in a single Darkmoon deck. Of course, this means that the cost of obtaining exalted status with Darkmoon Faire for the purposes of gaining The Insane achievement has been significantly lowered (some might argue altogether removed) it will still be much quicker for those of us who enjoy obtaining achievements sooner rather than later to farm Darkmoon cards.<br />
<br />
Can anyone shed light on whether or not the Test Your Strength quests and the profession quests are in fact repeatable or not, or if you can turn in more than 1 artifact a month? If these quests are in fact repeatable it would greatly speed up the rep gain from quests alone to the point of being able to go from Neutral to Exalted in one month.</div></div><hr />

I rush over there and am entirely disappointed. I never expected them to have it before I saw those people, but I honestly don't know a single person who has T5/T6 lock/priest, so I assumed it was from DMF and it skyrocketed my expectations.<br />
<br />
The current robes are awful (I already have full 'warlock' heirlooms so I've been there done that, and the other robes look awful). The leather/mail looks pretty unappealing too. The plate is okay, but I'm still going to just rock my purple Judgement recolor from Outland.</div></div><hr />

Thats a curious thing, they put the dungeon 0 AND the 0.5 but didnt put tier 3? If anything, people had more time to get those than tier 3 but still they put those back before the tier 3?

At least you can point to your time stamp and say &quot;I did it when Darkmoon was still hard&quot;. I've put in all the work so far but I'm still 18k worth of Darkmoon Faire rep off Insane in the Membrane. So I'm looking at getting the title post-nerf even though I've done almost all the work pre-nerf. I don't even get the option of doing the Shen'dralar. =(<br />

Agreed. And I'll use Transmogrification gone wrong as an example:<br />
<br />
So, months before Transmog was even announced, I needed to clear up some bank space and finally dicided my Tier 0, 1, 2, and PvP season 4(?) set were taking up too much space. I deleted everything except my Deathmist set, which was a big pain to get and was still pretty uncommon to see on a character.<br />
<br />
So then they announce Transmog and now I'm all mad because I already deleted a bunch of full sets and the one set I still had could now be purchased by anyone with the patience to farm all the tickets. They don't have to go through the ridiculously long quest chain, they can just buy it.</div></div><hr />

Also people actually complained about the dual spec when it was changed to be cheaper? jesus fuckers it's only 1000 gold, the hell? also insane title if you got it before the patch congrats if you got it after the patch congrats again dudes it's a title and it's not easy to get even with darkmoon being easy now. I'm pretty hype about the patch I want those companion pets it's gonna take me a whole year to get them probably :D. Let's see so 25 tickets 100% per day then 250 of those things might take a while to get but let's say 5 per day and another 23(i think) from professions then let's say 1 item drop per day that's 10 so we got 63 per day but not sure if the professions are easy they seem to be :D. You might not always get 63 per day so let's say 55 to be sure and it lasts 7 days you make 385 so you get 2 mounts :D. But maybe those items are not BOP and you can buy them off AH so maybe it is easy :D.</div></div><hr />

Its funny how people can deem themselves a majority while they are an obvious minority. Similar to how it has been over the years, however much that Blizzard wanted to promote it, raiding was always a form of content for players who played the game as more than a game. This is even worse now with the &quot;baddies&quot; of this crowd scaring away other players who want to experience this gameplay by requiring &quot;current&quot; character achievements along with absurd amount of ilvl(360 for Nefarian) for a content that was nerfed to be more accessible to the less dedicated.<br />
<br />
...and now this obviously what you will get as you had possibly alienated &quot;less raiding&quot; players, who are an obvious majority, with this sort of behavior, hence now Blizzard is supplying their demand for content through &quot;DMF Fair and such&quot; as they don't tend to raid but still wan to experience a gameplay.<br />

<br />
Some people did the grind without being rich. I had almost no money when I started, and I actually ended up making quite a bit off Darkmoon cards. Shendralar was infinitely more difficult than any of the other factions because the diamonds were just too damn rare. Everything else was just a fairly steady grind, and honestly Steamwheedle was probably one of the easiest if you just did the pirates outside of Ratchet with a group.</div></div><hr />

Yeah youre right, why they dont just remove all the useless scenery stuff and shit and make a dropdown menu like in battlefield where i can choose <br />

my mission aka raid / dungeon and there i go, just waiting for the loading screen and voila the action starts.<br />

with this method they could sqeeze way more bosses in the game !<br />

With the amount of daily's, the week / month fair and such, it will still take more than half a year for people to even get the rep with dmf. Still a pretty big grind imo, instead of just herbing and milling lowlevel herbs. The old dmf also had quests with rep turn ins, just with a stop at honored. Than there still is pirates and goblins, though most should have that by now, and the pickpocket from hell. I just hope the legendary questline will give some extra rep for rogue faction (i'm just in revered atm). Also i started way back with the grind but chose to go for the dire maul elves, and the lack of diamonds made me not finish it in time, i still have a bunch of diamonds and books laying ready not able to turn in anymore. I guess making the Darkmoon Faire a bit easier for me, since i don't like wasting herbs in mass amounts for a bit of rep, but i do like doing daily's for mounts and pets, is a way to reduce the pain of spending lots of gold and time on a never finished rep bar</div></div><hr />

I understand your sentiment here, but I think it's kind of good that they revamped the Darkmoon Faire, because it's grown fairly useless in its current incarnation. All it's really ever been good for was the trinkets from the cards and RP'ers messing around. So, I personally wouldn't mind a little more raid content, but I'm glad Blizzard also notices other areas of their game that are lacking and works on them as well.</div></div><hr />

Because more than likely more people enjoy this stuff than raids? WOW does suffer from lack of things to do after your max level other than raiding, which is no more than beating a script with a bunch of other people hoping everyone memorized the dosado.</div></div><hr />

because it honestly doesnt matter. yeah im sure some are gonna be disappointed that the rep is gonna be easier but this is not the first time blizzard has done this with a rep. it certainly wont be the last, when you are grinding out ach. you have to always keep in mind that eventually this ach is going to be easier to get (generally).<br />
<br />
either way most people are still not going to spend the time to grind out the rest of the reps required to get this title so i dont forsee a huge increase in players with that title.</div></div><hr />

Just thought I would share that</div></div><hr />

Until we know if they give rep till exalted or if it stops at honored (like the current rep quests), we don't know if this makes any significant difference or not.</div></div><hr />

Considering your avatar. I am mucho's disappointed at the lack of Papa Laz references. I want a peg vendor called Papa Lazarou with an army of men dressed as women all with the guild &lt;Wife&gt;.</div></div><hr />
