Details on Stats Inflation / Item Level / Character Power in 5.0 Soon<br />
Yea... about that inflation... more info to come soon on item levels &amp; character power in 5.0. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/204085/lvl-100-cap-what-will-happen-then) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3424796717?page=1#19))<br />
<br />
Level 100 Cap in future expansions?<br />
This is a pretty valid question. Do we have a solidified plan for future expansions I can share? Not yet, but consider that 100 is just a number. :) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/204085/lvl-100-cap-what-will-happen-then) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3424796717?page=1#7))<br />

Female Pandaren Model<br />
It's true the female models are not yet ready for show, which made me a little sad too. But we haven't forgotten the release timeline and public reaction to the female worgen model. I'll definitely check in with the developers. :) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/203838/was-mop-made-to-appeal-to-the-chinese) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3424793619?page=10#199))<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria Talent System<br />
The difference is that right now there's a way you spec your character, and then there's maybe a handful of &quot;Ok now you can do whatever you want with these 4 leftover points.&quot; Those points are leftover because they ultimately don't matter. You don't really even need to spend them to do well. It's not a good system, and the few leftover 'choices' don't feel awesome because... well they aren't, they aren't awesome, which is why they're unimportant points.<br />
<br />
With the new system we give you everything you really need automatically, and talents are going to be more interesting 'style' and utility choices than a bunch of stat and damage increases. The choice comes, hopefully, from choosing talents that appeal to how you like to play or what you think would be particularly useful for a specific boss, fight, or encounter, and the ability to swap around points freely while out in the world help reinforce that.<br />
<br />
I still fully expect for people to devise optimum builds for specific situations, but there's a difference between optimum and no choice at all.<br />
<br />
I think once you see the majority of talent choices you'll understand a bit more why these choices aren't really going to be bombarded by optimum build mentality. The choices just don't have a clear optimal because most of the choices don't lead to direct output increases.<br />
<br />
If that doesn't seem to be the case then we need to work on it more. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/203996/the-new-talent-system-will-fail-miserably) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3424905207?page=5#92))<br />

Pandarens not able to communicate with Pandarens of the other faction<br />
We do understand that, by not allowing pandaren of the opposite faction to communicate with one another, there's a breakdown in the story there. But we feel strongly at this point that changing the precedent on cross-faction communication for one race only will ultimately not lead to a good gameplay experience. We're very excited to introduce a race that can be chosen by either faction, though we don't see our philosophy on cross-faction communication changing as a result of this.<br />
<br />
This isn't very related, nor is it a way of properly compensating for that communication limitation, but one thing we'd like to do (we think is cool and warranted) is make a unique place in the world exclusive to monks -- think Moonglade for druids. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/204066/pandas-cant-talk-to-each-other-why) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3424796294?page=1#13))<br />

Theramore Destroyed in 5.0?<br />
So, at BlizzCon we provided a few details about a new expansion and how it's going to have an ever-growing focus on the fight between the Horde and the Alliance in the wake of dispelling many very powerful threats to all of Azeroth. Then we find out a vague detail that some sort of unrelenting attack by the Horde on Theramore is to come. The Horde, to remind you, is currently a faction with an overzealous ruler and significant turmoil among their faction leaders; while the Alliance has almost never been quite so unified and far removed from the days of imprisoning orcs.<br />
<br />
The first pawn on the chess board of what is to be the story for Mists of Pandaria is being moved, and you're angry at whose turn is first? I only offer that maybe there's a little more to the Horde and Alliance story lines in Mists than an Alliance town being leveled... like the entire expansion story you don't know about yet. ;)<br />
<br />
If you wanna make an omelette... (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/204003/theramore-in-flames-horde-favoritism-pt-2) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3430805957?page=2#26))<br />
<br />
[...] In Cataclysm, desperate times call for desperate measures. And that impact was not equal and 1:1 as far as Alliance and Horde went. The Warcraft universe, at its core, is based on the rivalry between two vastly different factions. To make sure they have shared hardships -- equal ups and downs at each interval -- is pretty boring and severely limits the character development of the leaders on both sides. And it leaves the story with a lack of momentum for building good content.<br />
<br />
The Cataclysm only ignited a new flame between the Horde and the Alliance, as each side approached recovering from the crisis in very different ways. But they have something much more pressing to focus on in this expansion: helping Thrall and the Dragon Aspects kill Deathwing and his followers. They provide the overarching and primary conflict in Cataclysm that needs to be dealt with, not the fighting between the Horde and Alliance.<br />
<br />
But once Deathwing goes and a new land of opportunity is discovered, who rebuilds, who explores, who defends and protects their people, and who seeks the pride of a conqueror? (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/204003/theramore-in-flames-horde-favoritism-pt-2) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3430805957?page=4#76))<br />
<br />
[...] What I'm hearing from people is, that Garrosh's Horde is attacking even more Alliance territory and it's not fair. As a player of both factions at level 85 and employee at Blizzard, I just don't fully agree with that assessment. From our perspective, one faction will assault a cherished town of the other faction -- which is also home to a very powerful and honorable figure in Jaina. There's now a conflict presented in the story there to further unfold in the next expansion. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/204003/theramore-in-flames-horde-favoritism-pt-2) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3430805957?page=6#115))<br />
<br />
Why the Pandarens?<br />
As Chris Metzen said in his interview on DirecTV just after opening ceremony, the pandaren race was originally planned to be added as the Alliance race in The Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
There are a number of reasons why that didn't happen, but none of them are because we thought they wouldn't make for compelling characters with interesting stories and living environments. We've wanted to add the pandaren people into the game for a long time. And, when recording feedback over the years from events like BlizzCon and many other avenues, the number one request (by a large margin) has been for us to add pandaren to the game. A lot of people want it and we feel the timing's just right post-Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
We want the next expansion to be less focused on a primary antagonist, and more on the conflict between the Horde and the Alliance after the fall of Deathwing, particularly as a new land with diverse and foreign cultures is discovered.<br />
<br />
The original World of Warcraft didn't have a primary antagonist and that wasn't strange to most players. Granted, we've set a precedent in the last few expansions of having the one major bad boy. But now, we want to focus much more on creating a bunch of varied content which lets you choose what you want to do in the game on any given day. We want to focus more on what's fun than what you have to do to excel -- and, by that, I mean we want more progression paths in the game to better cater to the extremely diverse player population.<br />
<br />
We wouldn't have gone forward with this idea if we weren't confident about whether or not we're breathing some new life into the game and changing up the formula.<br />
<br />
I understand the debate over this isn't going to be settled today -- or over the weekend -- but give it a bit to sink in, check out the remaining panels (including the Q&amp;A panel tomorrow), and be on the lookout for more information about our design intent for Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
As a side note, even with some of the inappropriate comments and spam going on today, we do still really appreciate how passionate everyone is about the direction of the game. We share that passion and look forward to continuing to divulge our evolving philosophy on making this the funnest game possible. And we'll make sure there are plenty of opportunities for open conversations between community managers, developers, and players as time advances (it's difficult for me to follow any thread for too long while working BlizzCon). For instance, we'll be doing a CoverItLive developer Q&amp;A next week with Lead Content Designer, Cory &quot;Mumper&quot; Stockton, and Lead Systems Designer, Greg &quot;Ghostcrawler&quot; Street, next week. Stay tuned for more info on that!</div></div><hr />

I share your compassion for this next expansion, im intrigued about the mystery of this expansion, the fact that we dont know how it will end..unlike all of the previous expansions.<br />

Because it's not what you expected or what always came the last times, it doenst need to be bad.<br />
The Pandas are a bit fluffy, yes, but we dont need badass Races every time. Lighten up and have some fun, there's more than only beeing badass.<br />
I dislike the fact of a shared race much more than the pandas themselfs.<br />

It's not just the pandas. It's the overall direction the game ist taking. It's not anywhere serious anymore. I know it never has been a serious game. But Pokemon, really? Talentsystem with no Talents, just to fit them for dungeon finder, really? A Race with absolutely no story, really? Horde vs Alliance, after we fought together for years now, shared a city, a lot of players have both horde and alliance characters by now, there is no way, they can make me believe I have to hate the other faction now. And of course Pandas!<br />
<br />
Vanilla didn't need a major villian, although it had like 3 of them. It was a new game and exciting by itself. Those times are over. And Blizz is trying to accomplish that by reducing the game to fluffy creatures and charactermechanics that are made for even the dumbest player out there can't do anything wrong. Limiting wrong choices by giving no choices is just not working for me.</div></div><hr />

The difference is that Gnomes and Goblins were never meant to be serious; they were always the comic relief. If one day Blizzard came along and said &quot;Right guys, from here on out you are supposed to take Goblins and Gnomes seriously, we are going to make them a serious race&quot;, people would laugh at you and ask if you were being serious at all. The same is true of Pandaren; born of a joke, but now we're expected to take them seriously. Well, i'm sorry, but i'm just not credulous enough for that.</div></div><hr />

A GAME!If you want serious things, allow me to introduce you to &quot;outdoors&quot;.While the panda theme sounds a bit off, I am realy looking forward to a more PvP expansion with lots of end game things to get up to which isnt always raiding. I mean by the sounds of things we are gonna see several new BG's and some more world PvP and PvE. A new class that looks fun as hell to play and a nice pritty zone to level in rather than all this crappy fire (its only crap imo because we have had it all dark since TBC- change is good sometimes).The game is getting old now, and introducing some fun thats not the &quot;normal&quot; is awsome, I find it very difficult to understand how you can hate something so much that you have never tried... its a fear of change. But you gotta realise is that change is good! And as stated in the QnA's we are building things up - they are planning the emerald dream and the invasion of the demon world(s) as well by the sounds. A nice fluffy expansion that is PvP based will be a lot of fun and a break from the traditional which means we will most probably enjoy the future expansions.I think also that this has been getting worked on for a year or 2, they have realised that they have made many mistakes with cata and cut many corners and I personally think they will try realy hard to impress with this expansion. If you remember all the hype about the last 3 expansions, all the QQ and dissappointment they had.. there isnt much hype here or promise either, looks like they are only offering on show what they will implement and what they believe people will love.Im an alliance player, not much into pvp and looking forward to have having a panda monk.... booting crap out of things while I heal and retaliating against the horde for destroying Therimore!!!!!!!!! :PSmile. With all the bad things going on in the world... sometimes you need something fun to make you smile :) Not more darkness and hate.My thoughts - I welcome these changes and pandas - looks lovely!Suiy<br />

They said that switching talents around will be just like switching Glyphs.<br />

It's just a a fun addition for pets, dont sweat it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talentsystem with no Talents, just to fit them for dungeon finder, really? <br />
In contradiction, I think the new talents are much better than before. Everything is a skill, u can use, instead of mostly passive increases and decreases of numbers AND I read you can easily change the skills, so you can adjust to another boss. You need Burst damage...these skills...a lot of adds...lemme take these skills...your healers are a little weak ? Lemme help them by improving my survivability.<br />
I think it's much better and flexible this way. To me it looks more like,...your DPS sucks, well, now it isnt because of your skilltree, but because of you.<br />
<br />
<br />
A Race with absolutely no story, really? Horde vs Alliance, after we fought together for years now, shared a city, a lot of players have both horde and alliance characters by now, there is no way, they can make me believe I have to hate the other faction now. And of course Pandas!<br />
WE only worked together against the Lichking, that's it. May I remind you of the Trial of the crusader...PVP event against the other faction. The Ulduar Trailer, they almost attacked each other in Dalaran...the battle for undercity, they would have if Jaina didnt stop them...oh and what about the gunship battle at Icecrwon ? Didnt look that harmonic to me.<br />
About the storyless Pandas: That's a given.<br />
They are NEW, that means they have to be introduced first. If they would already have their story and lore, it wouldnt really be new, would it? <br />
<br />
<br />
Vanilla didn't need a major villian, although it had like 3 of them. It was a new game and exciting by itself. Those times are over.

About the talents, see above. I think it's much better this way. If you can actually go WRONG in skilling it doesnt serve the purpose of improving your character any more. It is the right way to improve the character, no matter what you click, but now you have to USE the chosen skills instead of just getting your other skills buffed passively.<br />
Vanilla didnt have a mayor villian, just Raidbosses. You almost never heard of Nefarian, Onyxia, Ragnaros or Cthun outside of their raids. (with exceptions)<br />
It was plain stupid and boring. Just going in there, hitting them without really knowing what evil they did at all.</div></div><hr />

Then we find out a vague detail that some sort of unrelenting attack by the Horde on Theramore is to come. The Horde, to remind you, is currently a faction with an overzealous ruler and significant turmoil among their faction leaders; while the Alliance has almost never been quite so unified and far removed from the days of imprisoning orcs.The first pawn on the chess board of what is to be the story for Mists of Pandaria is being moved, and you're angry at whose turn is first? I only offer that maybe there's a little more to the Horde and Alliance story lines in Mists than an Alliance town being leveled... like the entire expansion story you don't know about yet. ;)If you wanna make an omelette...

<br />
The villian was the scourge (and ended with, guess what? Naxx). Just like all the xpacs later, it had a central villain/&quot;organization&quot; and &quot;side&quot; villains.<br />
<br />
Vanilla: Scourge + Old Gods (building up their story)/Black Dragonflight/Elemental Lords (Ragnaros);<br />
TBC: Burning Legion/Illidan + OL guys like Gruul and Kaelthas/Vash (same thing as Vanilla, finishing their stories from W3);<br />
WotLK: Scourge again, with their leader Lich King now + Old Gods (together with all titan stuff, keep going with Old Gods story from Vanilla) + tiny bit of dragonflights. Yes, way more centered at one &quot;organization&quot; this time, but still had it's side bosses;<br />
Cataclysm: Deathwing/Old Gods and everything related to them (like Twilight Hammer) + Elemental Lords (Al'akir and Ragnaros, unfortunatelly no Abysall Maw for Neptulon and more Old Gods).<br />
<br />
So, really no antagonist for vanilla, just some random bosses? Nothing nobody could read about even Onyxia?<br />
<br />
Guess ppl (even at Blizzard) started mixing poor story telling (or even marketing) at that time with today's better story telling + marketing. &quot;No boss on the box art, so, no main villain&quot;?

MoP is the truly one without a antagonist. So long as they don't keep going with the Old God story on it and just throw Pandaria threats on us.<br />

As always, Blizzardss soundtracks are great, though personally I would have wished pandaren music to be a little more...how to say it...less elegeant.<br />
fter all, the Pandas are not really graceful, so the music could be a mix of asian music as it is and some more bumpy parts.<br />
I've got no idea about making music and stuff, but these would be my ideas.<br />
<br />
@vanish02:<br />
Ah, you're right, I totally forgot about Naxxramas. Yes, the good old scourge propably was the boss to go in vanilla, although they just sat in their 2 zones and waited for somebody to pass by. ^^<br />
Onyxia...well maybe you got more infos about her on alliance side, but I cannot tell since I played horde only. The only onyxia Infos I can remember were the bits from the Ogres in Duskwallow Marsh. <br />
As a sidenote, I dont read the books, since the story is supposed to be told by the game, not seperately in a book.<br />
Blizzard really lacked some stroytelling skill for a long time. Even at the end of the lich king. I did all quests in Northrend avaiable to the horde and I was just like: Who the F is Bolvar ?</div></div><hr />

Where is the logic here? Are you saying they're a joke/not serious because they're fat, and therefore fat people can't fight? So far, nothing shown about the Pandaren has made them seem any less serious than any other race...except maybe Orc, Worgen, and Undead.</div></div><hr />

The scourge were not the ´main antagonist´of Vanilla... there was none.. by your definition it could have just as easily been the Sithilis... and Naxx was probably never the ´planned´ last raid of Vanilla until well after launch... they probably didn´t even have AQ planned. There were a lot of different storylines going on Vanilla including Rags, Sithilis and the Scourge. Basically each endgame leveling zone had it´s own problem that ended up being a Raid... all of them unrelated to each other. The scourge had very little impact on Kalimdor, or even southern EK. Naxx was a raid they threw in at the end because the expansion wasn´t ready.</div></div><hr />

If one day Blizzard came along and said &quot;Right guys, from here on out you are supposed to take Goblins and Gnomes seriously, we are going to make them a serious race&quot;, people would laugh at you and ask if you were being serious at all. The same is true of Pandaren; born of a joke, but now we're expected to take them seriously. Well, i'm sorry, but i'm just not credulous enough for that.<br />
The thing is, gnomes and goblins have been in the game for a WHILE. And, having said that, even the gnomes have had serious moments; the retaking of gnomeragon, for example. Did you read the Mechatorque short story? They took that shit dead serious.<br />
<br />
Pandaran may have started out as a joke, a but this was before they were ever implemented. That people have let the idea that they can only be a joke sink into their psyche with such certainty is awkward, since up until this announcement, we really haven't known that much about them, beyond the very serious concept artwork by Samwise.</div></div><hr />

Dude, if you've been around WoW for every expansion announcement, you will know that EVERY expansion has been met with mixed reviews. I remembered when Boub leaked the information about Cataclysm two months before it was announced. People freaked the f*** out over the idea. The same thing happened with BC and WotLK.</div></div><hr />

You don't really even need to spend them to do well. It's not a good system, and the few leftover 'choices' don't feel awesome because... well they aren't, they aren't awesome, which is why they're unimportant points.With the new system we give you everything you really need automatically, and talents are going to be more interesting 'style' and utility choices than a bunch of stat and damage increases. The choice comes, hopefully, from choosing talents that appeal to how you like to play or what you think would be particularly useful for a specific boss, fight, or encounter, and the ability to swap around points freely while out in the world help reinforce that.I still fully expect for people to devise optimum builds for specific situations, but there's a difference between optimum and no choice at all.I think once you see the majority of talent choices you'll understand a bit more why these choices aren't really going to be bombarded by optimum build mentality. The choices just don't have a clear optimal because most of the choices don't lead to direct output increases.If that doesn't seem to be the case then we need to work on it more.Is this guy on crack? I KNOW its a preliminary 'talent' tree. But why would I EVER choose a tanking talent as a DPS druid? OR a CC option as a FURY warrior? Or a HEALING talent as a Shadow Priest? I hope to hell it DOES change and drastically.<br />

<br />
And if they intend to focus on the PVP aspects with faction against faction what about the people who HATE &gt;:( PVP in any form? I play on a PVE server for a reason. I KNOW there are going to be dungeons, I KNOW there are going to be raids. WOW is a PVE-centric Game. PVP was extra goodies. Then they try to make it an e-sport so they put more focus on that end. Dont get me wrong i Greatly dislike PVP. I do BG when im bored or waiting for people to log in for a raid. i dont actually try and just pissed when i see how unbalanced PVP is as a whole.

Do you really think blizzard didn't analyze/research this? They even claimed that of all the races, pandaren was the most wanted.<br />
<br />
Before I respond to these claims, I want it known that I have no issues with Pandaren as a playable race. However, even though they are likely the most requested, they can still be very polarizing. If I'm ordering pizza and 55% of the people I'm ordering for say they want olives more than any other topping, but 45% say they won't eat olives period, I'd be better off not ordering it with olives because the 55% will be ok without them. Same principle may apply here. If they lose the players who absolutely hate the idea of Pandaren, then putting them in was a bad choice no matter how many people say they wanted them more than anything else. The majority would have been ok with another playable race, but the minority may not be ok with Pandaren.<br />
<br />
I don't think this will happen, and I think that once people settle down and realize it's not Kung Fu Panda and start getting more information things will be fine. Just wanted to point out that just because it was a very desired race by some, doesn't mean it was a good business decision to put them in the game.</div></div><hr />

Some of the wow art team (you know who) has some sick and unhealthy adiction to pandas. Its the same dude that thought it would be funny to offend alliance players during the event. That might have been a joke btw, but think George Lucas going to a convencion and saying empire fans are cocksucking emos.

In what way is the entire expansion focused around them, exactly?<br />
<br />
There's the Alliance / Horde war.<br />
The evil energy creatures that feed on negative emotions.<br />
The insectoid race releated to the qiraji and nerubians.<br />
The statue-like race that has a Titan database in their temple.<br />
The invading Zandalari troll empire.<br />
<br />
Plus with PvE scenarios they can easily add new mini-instance stories in any zones of the game.<br />
<br />

<br />
The thing is, gnomes and goblins have been in the game for a WHILE.<br />
Actually, if you really want to get into comparing other races to the pandaren, the fact is this:<br />
<br />
Gnomes basically didn't exist at all before World of Warcraft. Their only appearance before Classic WoW was through two units in Warcraft 2 (http://www.wowpedia.org/Warcraft_2_units). I'm going to go ahead copy and paste ALL of the gnome lore that existed before World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gnomish Flying Machine: The Gnomes of Khaz Modan have long offset their lack of physical strength with ingenuity and daring. As members of the Alliance, they have continued to display their talents by inventing and piloting the unbelievable Flying Machine. Although having no armaments, these awkward contraptions can be used to survey vast areas of terrain, and detecting the otherwise hidden movements of underwater units (as all flying units can), making them invaluable for discovering the movements of the Horde.<br />
<br />
Gnomish Submarine: The resourceful Gnomish Inventors have designed an amazing craft known as the Submarine. This watertight vessel can submerge beneath the waves and surreptitiously keep watch on enemy forces above the surface. The Gnomish Submarine is visible only to Towers, aerial forces, and other vessels that move beneath the waves. Using cunning and craft to carry out surprise attacks on more powerful enemies makes the Submarine an invaluable part of the Lordaeron armada.<br />
<br />
That's it. Literally all of it. 100% of the pre-WoW gnome lore.<br />
<br />
And frankly, draenei and worgen weren't much better.<br />
<br />
Draenei were first mentioned in the Warcraft II manual and had a minor role in Chapters 5 (http://www.wowpedia.org/Gates_of_the_Abyss) and 6 (http://www.wowpedia.org/Lord_of_Outland) of Curse of the Blood Elves (http://www.wowpedia.org/Curse_of_the_Blood_Elves), the blood elf campaign of Waracraft III: The Frozen Throne. At the time, they had no connection to the eredar, which had also been invented for Warcraft III as part of the complete retcon to WC2's backstory; before WC3, the orcs had been sent to Azeroth by 'daemons' from Hell, not the Burning Legion. In order to create the playable draenei race, Blizzard retconned the backstories for both the draenei and the eredar.<br />
<br />
Worgen didn't exist at all before WoW. In WoW, they were monsters that you fought against in quests for Silverpine Forest, Duskwood, and Ashenvale. The original story for worgen was that they were feral monsters summoned from another dimension by Arugal and Velinde to try and fight the Scourge and Burning Legion, respectively. To implement them in Cataclysm, Blizzard revised and expanded their backstory in order to incorporate druids, Gilneas, and the Emerald Dream.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, at the end of the day, the pandaren already had far, far more lore (from Warcraft III and the World of Warcraft: Dark Factions RPG sourcebook) than the gnomes, draenei, or worgen did before becoming WoW races.<br />
<br />
How people can complain about pandaren lore, and accept those other three races, is frankly beyond me.</div></div><hr />

I guess Blizzard really just doesn't trust it's own userbase in allowing players in opposite teams to communicate to each other... like every other game usually does.</div></div><hr />

I play on a PVE server for a reason. I KNOW there are going to be dungeons, I KNOW there are going to be raids. WOW is a PVE-centric Game. PVP was extra goodies. Then they try to make it an e-sport so they put more focus on that end. Dont get me wrong i Greatly dislike PVP. I do BG when im bored or waiting for people to log in for a raid. i dont actually try and just pissed when i see how unbalanced PVP is as a whole. (****ing rogues).<br />

No one says you have to have player vs player to get across the fighting of a war.<br />
<br />
They did a pretty good job having you attacking horde or alliance areas and going against their troops as quests and never flagging once.Just look at the Horde attack in Astranaar,you never flagged doing that.The fighting in Stone Talon,never flagged there either attacking the night elf forces.<br />
<br />
They will just do the same as they did in Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am sure Blizzard considers the state of real world economic trends as they plan future expansions. <br />

However, even though they are likely the most requested, they can still be very polarizing. If I'm ordering pizza and 55% of the people I'm ordering for say they want olives more than any other topping, but 45% say they won't eat olives period, I'd be better off not ordering it with olives because the 55% will be ok without them. Same principle may apply here. If they lose the players who absolutely hate the idea of Pandaren, then putting them in was a bad choice no matter how many people say they wanted them more than anything else. The majority would have been ok with another playable race, but the minority may not be ok with Pandaren.<br />
<br />
I don't think this will happen, and I think that once people settle down and realize it's not Kung Fu Panda and start getting more information things will be fine. Just wanted to point out that just because it was a very desired race by some, doesn't mean it was a good business decision to put them in the game.<br />
<br />
This is a fair reasoning and one that I think needs some attention.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It also uses numbers that are pulled out of thin air?<br />
<br />
Where are the figures that say it's 45% of people willing to quit WoW if pandaren are introduced? Vocal minorities skew numbers for extreme positions all of them time, this doesn't take into account all the people who don't like pandaren but will still play and those who do like pandaren and will still play. In this situation the number of people who would be willing to quit based on pandaren being introduced is likely far lower. Using the pizza analogy it would be like 1 person in the group of 20 not liking olives and having to deal with them or pick them off.</div></div><hr />
