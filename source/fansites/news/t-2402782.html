Book summary:<br />
<br />
Azeroth is dying.<br />
<br />
The Horde and the Alliance defeated the demonic Burning Legion, but a dire catastrophe is unfolding deep below the surface of the world. There is a mortal wound in the heart of Azeroth, struck by the sword of the fallen titan Sargeras in a final act of cruelty.<br />
<br />
For Anduin Wrynn, king of Stormwind, and Sylvanas Windrunner, warchief of the Horde and queen of the Forsaken, there is little time to rebuild what remains and even less to mourn what was lost. Azeroth’s devastating wound has revealed a mysterious material known as Azerite. In the right hands, this strange golden substance is capable of incredible feats of creation; in the wrong ones, it could bring forth unthinkable destruction.<br />
<br />
As Alliance and Horde forces race to uncover the secrets of Azerite and heal the wounded world, Anduin enacts a desperate plan aimed at forging a lasting peace between the factions. Azerite jeopardizes the balance of power, and so Anduin must gain the trust of Sylvanas. But, as ever, the Dark Lady has her own machinations.<br />
<br />
For peace to be possible, generations of bloodshed and hatred must be brought to and end. But there are truths that neither side is willing to accept and ambitions they are loath to relinquish. As Alliance and Horde alike grasp for the Azerite’s power, their simmering conflict threatens to reignite all-out war—a war that would spell doom for Azeroth.</div></div><hr />

I thought it would be some gray scenario with both sides... but this is just one-sided... even the beginning of the cinematic, the things that the warchife says, don't make seans.<br />
<br />
Could they not make her better, and fix her char in a way... why must the horde constantly circle through warchifes ? She could have been such a good gray char... but they are clearly going the other rute... :'(</div></div><hr />

blizzard story telling is so transparent is laughable, ill tell you what happens in BFA<br />
The mortal wound will be ofc healed by us, sylvanas will go super evil but as a misdirection and something will be shown to us that evil is a perspective and it can come from where we least expect it, like her sisters</div></div><hr />

you death wrong, Sylvanas maybe is evil, she have a more grim look of the world. But you will see how they make her the hero, it was show that the void fear her.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The twist is that Sylvanas is actually... SUPER DUPER OMEGA EVIL! Nathanos, make me a sandwich! MADE OUT OF BABIES! See, morally grey. Not like she is eating children and toddlers, just babies who don't realize what is happening to them. So... yeah... *Weeps softly in tauren*</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I really, really, REALLY don't like the direction they're taking Sylvanas with making her as evil and war-hungry as possible. This is not the same Sylvanas we've always known.</div></div><hr />

How is evilness defined? Lack of morals? What are the right morals?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No. A mortal wound is one that if not healed/cured/fixed it will kill the victim.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's like Blizzard has managed to come up with only one type of storyline that had now been turned into a stack of cards. Whenever they need to push the story forward in one of their games, they shuffle the deck and pick something. Character gets corrupted, character breaks out of the corruptor's control, character does shit ranging from morally questionable to outright evil, character has a change of heart and becomes an anti-hero. They used this sort of progression multiple times already, with a few steps added or removed inbetween. Kerrigan, Arthas(just swap out the heel-face turn for supplanting said corruptor instead), Sylvanas, the Void Elves to an extent, Illidan, hell, the Orcs and the Horde went through this as a race. And with the Naaru being built up as not-so-benevolent as they seemed, we might have to throw the Lightforged into the pile as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the problem.Most of the people are looking at Sylvanas through their human morality view.But she is dead now.So why must she have the same morals as us?I like the way Blizzard are building her character.I expect good things in the future.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">daerellin</div><div class="date">2018-06-10, 02:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find it interesting how polarizing Sylvanas has become as a character. I've been reading fairly passionate responses in the love/hate column for months now, often leading to outright hostility. Liking Sylvanas isn't really that deep, imo. In life, I am a mild-mannered cybersecurity analyst who gets along with everyone; in game I want to be a murderous villain plowing through the &quot;good guys&quot; with reckless abandon. I'm more than happy with what she has done so far, and for once I am genuinely excited about what might happen story-wise in in an expansion.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I'd appreciate it if she were to put 2 more points into Genocidal Rampage.</div></div><hr />
