What Active Mitigation Actually Means, and the Future of the Blood Death Knight<br />
<br />
We recently buffed tank threat significantly and suggested that we would fill in any potential lost gameplay with new gameplay. What I meant by that was that if tanks don’t need to hit their buttons to generate threat, they may realize they don’t need to hit most of their buttons at all, and just stand there waiting until the right time to Shield Wall. Going a GCD or two without using a combat ability is fine with us. Standing around much longer than that gets boring quickly.<br />
<br />
What we proposed is that tanks should ideally want to hit their buttons because it keeps them alive. I didn’t elaborate on that too much except to say it would feel more like the Blood DK method of tanking, which prompted some players to state that they didn’t like the DK model, or to point out that the DK model is not just active but reactive. Fair enough.<br />
<br />
To better explain what we meant by that we need to define active mitigation. We define it as hitting buttons regularly that have a meaningful impact on your future mitigation. You should occasionally alter your rotation depending on what is going on in the fight, but you should still mitigate regularly and not save everything for the really big, predictable hits. DKs have a little of this, but Death Strike is ultimately a heal, which is a response to damage, not damage prevention. I also think the DK model gets a bad rap because of some other mechanical problems, which aren’t really problems with active mitigation per se. So let me go into a bit more hand-waving about what active mitigation could mean for other tanks, and then I’ll share a little DK info.<br />
<br />
<br />
Some Active Mitigation Models<br />
<br />
Here are three different models for why hitting buttons can matter to tanks. It's easy to come up with alternative models, and none of these are perfect, nor are we ready to announce which is the one we’re going to try first. But these ideas can get some discussions going.<br />
<br />
Model One: Tank DPS matters<br />
<br />
This one really isn't active mitigation per se, but it is a way to make pushing buttons matter. We have berserk timers or other DPS checks on a lot of our encounters. Typically tank DPS isn’t taken seriously on these fights, which is a little puzzling at first glance. Yes, the tank may not be able to match the Enhance shaman for damage done, but also consider that the Enhance shaman would absolutely love it if she could improve her DPS by a paltry 3K. That 3K may be enough to meet that DPS check. Note that I’m not talking about tanks being able to beat out skilled DPS players; I think most of us agree that would be a little bizarre. But that doesn’t mean tank damage has to be a non-factor either. Sure, the Feral tank may be doing 16K DPS to the shaman’s 30K, but 3K is 3K.<br />
<br />
I polled all of the class designers who raid Heroic content (which is all of them, I believe) and only one had ever given his tanks a hard time for low DPS. Sometimes it’s just not possible because of the fight dynamics. In other cases it is, but as a community, we tend to not focus on tank DPS. We sometimes ask healers to Shadow Word: Pain, even though the contribution is trivial. Go figure. Maybe we assume tanks already have enough on their plate. Maybe they really are prima donnas and we don’t want them to /ragequit. (I kid.)<br />
<br />
One potential downside of this model is that it's just the old threat rotations but with the emphasis on DPS rather than threat per second. Ultimately, we want tanks to feel like their rotations are related to tanking and that they aren't just doing a DPS rotation with the occasional long cooldown. Another is that it makes not only stats like hit and expertise desirable, but also crit and haste, which aren’t typically on plate tanking gear. We want to make tank itemization more interesting than just “stack mastery,” but we don’t want it to be baffling either.<br />
<br />
Model Two: DPS buttons provide mitigation<br />
<br />
This is the model that several players in the community have predicted will be our approach, and the idea has some merit. Under this model, imagine that a warrior wants to hit Shield Slam because it makes his next Shield Block larger. Imagine Revenge procs a short parry buff. Devastate and Thunder Clap already have roles applying debuffs. This model we think could feel pretty intuitive. One downside is that each individual button might feel less impactful and make the experience less visceral. Shield Block feels awesome because when you push it, the damage numbers go way down, and you feel “safe” for the duration. If you replace one slice of that pie with Revenge and Shield Slam, then everything gets watered down. If the rotation is very simple, then it feels like passive mitigation; if not then it’s a stressful juggling act. Another potential downside is that keeping up multiple buffs and debuffs can be tedious. Rather than it feeling like a bonus to get those procs, it can feel like a penalty whenever they’re not up. Even if you are hit and expertise capped, sometimes you have to move away from the boss to avoid a fire ring, or you need to leave to pick up an add. If you can’t bank the mitigation benefit, then the risk is you feel like you don’t really have control over your survivability.<br />
<br />
Model Three: DPS buttons build up resources<br />
<br />
This model lets you bank the benefits. Imagine you have to build up a resource to use on short-term cooldowns. We couldn't include the Shield Walls and their ilk here, because an &quot;oh snap&quot; button needs to be available immediately and not in the future once you've earned some resources. But weaker cooldowns such as Shield Block and Holy Shield could certainly work this way. Imagine the paladin tank needs Crusader Strike to land to generate Holy Power, and can then decide to spend that Holy Power on Holy Shield Block or Word of Glory. Neither of those would have a cooldown in this design, so more hits landing will always be better -- it's not just a matter of hitting enough to have 100% uptime. (You'd probably also need the ability to save Holy Power more than you can today so that there was less pressure to spend a cooldown as soon as it became available.)<br />
<br />
The choice can then become whether to use Holy Shield Block or Word of Glory. Holy Shield Block is probably your first choice, but if you screw it up or the damage is magical, or you need a reactive button instead of an active one, then Word of Glory might be a better choice. Either way, there shouldn’t be any simple answers. (As a counterpoint, deciding to spend that Holy Power on threat instead of mitigation is just never going to be interesting -- smart tanks will always use it to survive, as we saw before Protection had a Word of Glory cooldown.)<br />
<br />
As an aside, the Feral druid's mitigation is arguably the most passive right now, and we’d want to change things like Savage Defense to be active buttons under this model. One downside of Model Three is the risk that the rotation could be too formulaic: AAAAB, for example. It could also be asking a lot of tanks -- rather than just hitting buttons to generate threat, tanks would need to pay active attention to managing a resource. No more infinite rage just for getting beat on. We want tanking to be fun, and we think that needs to include a certain degree of risk of failure for not playing well, but that doesn't mean it needs to be frustrating. Challenging and frustrating don't need to go together.<br />
<br />
Again, these aren't the kind of changes we will hotfix in. It's going to take a lot of thought and a lot of feedback from players to get things feeling right. As a comparison, we still stand behind the mana adjustments we made for healers for Cataclysm. We think the healer gameplay is more engaging than it was at the end of Lich King, but that's obviously very subjective and took a lot of getting used to, even for seasoned players. We'd like to introduce the tanking changes more smoothly, but we still want to introduce them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bloody Death Knights<br />
<br />
The risk of talking about one particular spec in a blog is then everyone will wonder when BM hunters or Disc priests are going to get &quot;their&quot; blog. It's not going to work like that, but since I referenced the DK tanking style so much in the previous tanking blog, I feel like it's appropriate to go into a little more detail about what we don't like about DK tanking (and how we’re going to fix it) so that all tanks have a better idea of what the future might hold for their own character.<br />
<br />
Outbreak<br />
<br />
One of the fundamental tensions in DK tanking is deciding whether to spend a rune on diseases (which offer necessary tanking debuffs) or save the rune for Death Strike. Our hope was that choosing how to spend the resources would be interesting. A rogue for example has to decide on whether to spend resources on Slice and Dice or Eviscerate (or a number of other things). In reality though, we don’t think this decision has been a fun one. You feel cheated if you refresh diseases and then need to Death Strike a moment later, and you feel like a bad tank if you just neglect diseases. For 4.3, we’re going to give Blood DKs a 30 second Outbreak, so they will never have to manually apply diseases to a single target. Yes, that can lead to even more Death Strikes but we think adding a fun alternative to Death Strike is not the kind of thing we can easily change for 4.3.<br />
<br />
I feel the need to point out that we’re not just being lazy here. We understand that many players get really worn down by constant class design change, especially mid-expansion, even if they end up improving the experience overall. Deciding when to make serious changes and when to wait is a major challenge of MMO game design. I’ll try and explore this more in a future blog.<br />
<br />
Blade Barrier<br />
<br />
We originally designed this talent to encourage DKs to not sit on their runes, and it worked fine for that. However, the current model of Death Strike, which we also like, is that the timing of the Death Strike matters a great deal, encouraging you to… you guessed it… sit on your runes. We’re just going to change Blade Barrier to something more passive (and yes, temporarily more boring) for 4.3.<br />
<br />
Death Strike<br />
<br />
It sucks when Death Strike misses. &quot;Stack hit and expertise&quot; is an answer to that, but not one that's really viable or even fair given that other tanks will care even less about hit and expertise in the short term. Rather than making Death Strike always hit, we’re going to let it always heal you, and proc Blood Shield, even when it misses. This kind of tweak may very well be an interim solution given that everything I said above was that we want tanks to care about hitting to drive their mitigation. But we don’t think it’s fair to penalize the DK for working the “new way” while everyone else is still working the &quot;old way,&quot; and it's too much of a change for 4.3 to apply the &quot;new way&quot; to the other three classes. In the long term, as in the Protadin example above, the rotation can't just be Death Strike, Death Strike, Death Strike... Death Strike.<br />
<br />
Bone Shield<br />
<br />
This change is something we’re exploring but may not pan out, so no claiming we &quot;promised&quot; this *cough*Abyssal Maw*cough*. So… CAVEAT: this may not come to pass. What we’re considering doing with Bone Shield is have it mitigate damage spikes. DKs are prone to spikes more so than the other tanks, particularly the paladin and warrior who can &quot;block cap&quot; (I assume most of you know what that entails, if not, a helpful explanation if someone asks in the comments would be appreciated). Death Strike can theoretically handle the spikes, but if you miss (less of an issue with the above change) or time your DS poorly, you might take much higher damage than other tanks from a single hit. Our idea is that Bone Shield would expend a charge to dampen those spikes specifically. If a single attack did a huge percent of your total health, then some of that attack would be automatically lessened for the cost of a charge. Smaller hits wouldn’t spend a charge.<br />
<br />
Blood Shield<br />
<br />
This is an even longer-term change. Death Strike feeling reactive is fun, and one of the things we like about how the DK tanks. Death Striking after a big hit can heal you more than Death Striking before a big hit, so you should ideally pay attention to what the boss is doing instead of just mashing buttons as soon as the runes come up. When you heal a novice DK, you may just notice they take a lot of damage. When you get in sync with a talented DK, you come to know when they are going to Death Strike and recover from big hits. However, sometimes inevitably the tank is going to hit DS too soon and not have it available a second later. Our idea is to somehow turn Blood Shield into more of a pool that you actively try to build and maintain. A system where you’re able to add to a pool of absorption would provide more granularity, which in turn would be more forgiving of errors or streaks of bad luck.<br />
<br />
<br />
There you have it. When we're ready for the 4.3 PTR, you’ll hopefully see some of these DK changes in place. The blog we wrote that dove into our thought process for the 4.2 patch notes ended up being the most positively received blog that the class team has ever done, so we’ll definitely do one of those again for 4.3. As I mentioned, more active mitigation will probably wait for farther in the future. We might talk about how we decide on when a change is more appropriate for a hotfix, patch, or full expansion in the next developer blog. While it might be short on upcoming class changes, hopefully it will still prove interesting to some of you.<br />

Crusader Strike missing doesn't mean you fail at blocking the next attack though. DS miss at the moment means you A: Didn't get the heal and B: Didn't get a Blood Shield to mitigate some of the next hit's damage. If DS healed regardless of hit then you'd have a point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is debate, go look at the forums. The problem is that less than 1% of suggestions from the community might actually be mindful and sound. This is why you don't let the players design the whole game, or even large chunks of it. Discussion is fine, but seriously... discussion with this community, or any online community? Lol..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't get that vibe, it was clearly saying &quot;We know what to do (nerf the other tank classes and fix bosses around Death Knight level of tanking) but we can't do it this expansion&quot;. That phrase is turning into a very familiar piece of text, granted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
CS not generating Holy Power does mean that you now have to wait 4.5 seconds to attempt to generate the next one and if that misses you've now wasted 9 seconds, considering you need to generate 3 of them anyway and you have an issue.<br />
<br />
Now, if Blizzard wants to make tanking more reactive, this kind of delay can't really be allowed to occur. It used to be a bit of issue when threat mattered and even more of one when Prots used to WoG-tank.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sarella</div><div class="date">2011-08-31, 06:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One of the fundamental issues which is not being answered is:How do we make 4 tanks similar enough that one is not singled out as bad, while keeping a unique feel to it.As a long-time bear tank I read all about dk tanks and how tanks don't have to actively mitigate damage and I think to myself &quot;Hang on, Don't I dps harder to get more crits to keep my savage defense up?&quot;While it's not as strong as a blood shield or death strike self-healing, isn't the issue they feel tanks are boring/don't do enough?As a druid tank I've always felt my tanking dps is important to kills - for example 19k dps tanking Lord Rhyolith helps keep people alive by getting the fragments down. I've known that if I stop attacking, my shield will fall more and I'll take more damage because my &quot;block&quot; will come down.But the DK went a bit far to the extreme - it was supposed to be a partner for the druid, akin to paladin/warrior... but they decided to wreck it with this whole self-healing rubbish.Giving tanks active mitigation akin to a druid tank would be great - going further would be good perhaps. But at the same token it's about time a dk stopped healing itself for 7k a second in favor of actually mitigating the damage (please note: if you heal damage after it occurs, you've mitigated the same as a squirrel who happened to be standing beside you).So why don't DK's stop focusing on Death Strike as a whole, and start to call Ghostcrawler a liar until he learns the english definition of Mitigation. (PS, claiming a self-heal mitigates the pain is a falsehood - the healer stills feels the pain, the tank still feels it... but the health comes back up instantly).</div></div><hr />

I would suspect they may try what they suggested for DS: even if it misses, the mitigation aspect still works. So you'd still get a Holy Power even if Crusader Strike was dodged, parried, or missed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're right, RIGHT NOW. These DK changes however, I think more than would make up the difference. Also, the Savage defense 50% proc can be very, very bad at the moment. Having a mastery be 'roll-the-dice' is bad, especially if it's a core tank mechanic. They're fixing that part of DKs(which was AT WORST ~20% miss) and druids is ALWAYS 50% not proccing. Not to mention boss damage scales faster than tank attack power, meaning blood shields will scale better than Savage Defense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On a serious note, Seems great changes... Nothing that makes us overpowered or clearly best than the others, but clearly a change into removing the lame mechanics we had... Love the outbrake (was expected), Love the non missing DS (something in line was expected), never expected the blood barrier change (seemed obvious, but the problems were so large)... The bone shield seems the best and most awaited for me.... Still waiting to see the blood shield change... <br />

Then they'll probably make the miss consume a rune, I'd suspect. I don't think they'd want us to specifically not gear for something. Otherwise, I don't think we'll miss that much to merit an RNG like that. What's the miss % on 88's with no additions to hit/exp? And would you really want every other attack you go for missing as much as that? DS is the only (and obviously most important) think that will be missing, but...if you miss rune strike 3x in a row in a fight that has more than a few targets, and your taunts are down...someone is dying :P</div></div><hr />

The only problem with a miss / dodge / parry consuming the runes will be a nerf to our DPS. Some fights (Alysrazor, Sons on the Rag transition, Baleroc to a much smaller extent) rely heavily on the DPS of tanks. While this change would be good for most bosses, it will be a nerf to DKs on others.</div></div><hr />

Of course, I would rather they made some tweaks and turned every class into a &quot;hybrid&quot;, with at least one tree able to heal or tank. Hunters get an actual elite pet but have to concentrate on keeping it in check and it lowers their DPS by 30%. Warlocks get a Fel Lord and similar situation. Rogues already have the Combat tree which is pretty tanky feeling already. Mages would get Arcane Regeneration.</div></div><hr />

Protadin says hi!. Protadin &quot;rune&quot; (Crusader Strike and Hammer of the Righteous) generate our secondary resource, on a 3 second CD. If it misses, we lose out on our secondary resource and the CD is not reset. Granted the Protadin has many other options that are not reliant on our secondary resource, but loosing the flow on our secondary resource still hurts. Word of Glory right after a nasty hit helps healer mana.<br />
<br />
And I think GC missed the point on the pre-nerf Protadin WoGing. It wasn't so much that it was always better, but there were two talents that made WoGing the best way to go (30% proc to refund 3 holy power after a WoG, and WoG granting pre-change Holy Shield, with any overheal creating an absorption bubble). Both of those talents now are skipped in the Prot tree, which is sad because the &quot;WoG to get Holy Shield&quot; talent is in a bottom tier.</div></div><hr />

Fix them both now, I say! Make them both unmissable since they don't want tanks to cap hit / exp.</div></div><hr />

The water cooler is in fact a way for the devs to seed discussion in the community, thereby getting feedback to things they are discussing. This is also a good way to gauge player reaction. Sort of like how one might get a discussion started with the wife regarding a threesome ... you throw it out there, and gauge the reaction.

I wouldn't mind if they made us punch people and bite them, that would pretty awesome. Instead of Death Strike you could have Death Bite and instead of Blood Strike you can have Blood Punch. Instead of Icy Touch you could have Uncomfortable Massage.</div></div><hr />

These changes seem a bit OP to me. I already can keep up with other tanks as it is. The missing and procing a sheild anyway means dk's will be dropping all the expertise/hit they had until they can just barely generate enough threat to keep the boss on them and then afk/spamming ds till the fight is over with outbreak thrown in every 30 secs. <br />

<br />
So a double melee comp is OP? Use snares and slows, and kite them. Use your CC. Save Disengage/Blink/Sprint/Ghostwolf/etc etc for the DG/CoI combo. The only ranged options BloodDKs have are DG, DC, Outbreak, DarkSirc and CoI. If the BloodDK goes to Unholy Presence to gap close, they lose out on their bubble. And with the change to the DS glyph and BloodShield, it is actually hurting BloodDks to go Unholy Presence. <br />
<br />
<br />
Besides, Blizz has stated that Arena Pvp is not balance against 2s.</div></div><hr />

Segway into the Pandaren Monk people are so sure is feasible. Tanks without weapons - &gt;Class that doesn't need weapons - &gt;Monks.<br />

Maybe they should stop changing tank mechanics and start upping boss mechanics. Give a boss a pool of 20 abilities per phase that tests the dps, tank, or healers equally and randomly. Then everyone would have to be on their toes and it'd be fun. I wanna see prettier moves and animations from bosses, tehe.</div></div><hr />

Who kept hit/exp anyhow? Anyone with half a brain reforged it or didn't take said item.<br />

I'd imagine they would just make it consume runes on hit or miss. Obviously if it didn't, missing would be preferable to hit, and that's silly.</div></div><hr />

Most tanks go for as little exp/hit as possible anyway. Frankly I'd be very happy with this change if it would prevent this from happening (http://media.veinlash.com/2011-08-30_2108.png) ever again.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gortz</div><div class="date">2011-08-31, 08:37 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First of all, threat was already meaningless before this patch except for initial aggro and even that wasn't a big problem with MD. I feel pretty happy as a tank with the way things are atm and don't see any of these active mitigation models (or similar) as positive. We already have enough things going on beyond our basic key bashing abilities that keep us very much interested. Reactive i.e. &quot;my HP dropped 30k, ill use THIS ability&quot; is very dull and takes our focus away from other things. I for one LOVE the fact that i'm more free to look around and watch what other people are doing in the raid rather than focusing so much on a bunch of timers and other things DPS/healers keep an eye on. To help illustrate this a bit more, having the ability to do that is what makes me a better tank than some of the newer tanks that focus too much on abilities. If it aint broke, don't fix it.. but fix DKs. If you want tanks to do more damage then buff our damage but it won't matter or make it more meaningful lol.<br />
<br />
&quot;Hitting buttons&quot; won't matter more either with these models. If you make the abilities award parry and stuff it's just going to be a negative if they're not up and a gimmick overall since we're already getting this damage mitigation already (they said it would be a piece of the pie.. ie.. they take away some mastery/parry/dodge% to add to these mashable &quot;on CD&quot; abilities etc) and guess what, we're still gonna mash them in the same way we do currently anyway. So i ask you, where is the meaning in that? <br />
<br />
Having said that. I don't mind the idea of building up resources too much but again, if it aint broke, dont fix it. The only reason i find this interesting is because i can picture my shield slams causing larger shield blocks or more crit shield blocks etc but do i really care about it? I don't believe it makes it more &quot;interesting&quot; as it's basically adding an extra little gimmick to abilities we press already in the exact same fashion and i dunno, i don't see the warriors, paladins or druids complaining about the current model. I see DKs complaining and i would complain too. Fix DKs so their model works or revert it and leave us.</div></div><hr />

The difference between these 2 abilities is Deathstrike is actually used to create a form of mitigation. Where Crusader Strike is an ability that gives you a secondary resource that strictly gives you threat and threat only. The penalty of missing a deathstrike is equal to less threat and less mitigated damage. Crusader Strike on the other hand only leaves you missing out on threat. A change that i would like to see for CS would be if CS/HotR miss/dodge/parry it reduces the CD of those abilities to equal that of the GCD. As for the Bloodshield Vs Savage Defense after this buff to Deathstrike i'd like to see savage defense a little closer in comparison. Savage Defense being 50% chance on your say 40% Crit isn't as appealing compared to every other tanking classes Mastery.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ragingsoul</div><div class="date">2011-08-31, 08:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I have to say is: I despise self healing as tank. because of this, I don't like blood tanking, and I never even spec prot on my pala since cata, after having tanking with him for 3 years. Only tank I sometimes play is prot warrior, which still feels about the same, and a bit like a tankadin from the past. If they want those changes for all tanks, they'll have 1 less tank to worry about, and 1 less tank in LFG.<br />
I'm sure some people will like it more, but I know a lot of veteran tanks from vanilla and TBC, that won't continue if those changes are made for all tanks. It's just not what we loved about tanking anymore. <br />
<br />
A rogue for example has to decide on whether to spend resources on Slice and Dice or Eviscerate (or a number of other things). Those are in fact miss leading choices, and in the end, are not choices anymore. <br />
You never let SnD fall, there is no choice to make between refreshing it, or doing something else. On the other hand, the choice to use 4 or 5 combo points is viable. The same way, there is no choice to use VT with 1, 2 or 3 holy power. it's 3 or nothing, 1 and 2 are just not even remotely worth it, and thus, there is no choice in the matter. <br />
<br />
it's very risky to put those kind of mechanics. People will analyze, and if scenario A puts more dps/mitigation than scenario B, then scenario B will never happen. The choice of using it disappear.<br />
Also, changing this like this, will likely turn veteran tanks with experience away, for new players that never experience tanking before. It's sad really. It made sence back in TBC, to have holy shield/shield block active all the time. and you were turning your rotation for those important buttons and mitigation buttons. The rest was keeping aggro for your dps, and avoiding fire.<br />
But ofc, after:<br />
<br />
Removing Crushing blows<br />
Putting DR on tanking stats<br />
Removing Defense rating<br />
Making every piece of gear a potential tanking piece with reforging<br />
Making threat generation irrelevant<br />
Removing the little &quot;work&quot; of a CC pull with CC and aggro mechanics.<br />
<br />
They removed so much from the spec that they need to find something &quot;fun&quot; again. why not simply put dps gear and convert haste to parry and crit to dodge really, to make it even less atractive, or is that the next step?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">underdogba</div><div class="date">2011-08-31, 08:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My take on all of this &quot;active mitigation&quot; business is that instead of just fixing DK's to take less burst damage and accepting that their original design was a total mistake, they have to engage in this convuluted plan to make every tank behave more like that to pretend that they know what they're doing.<br />
<br />
This is just far too much monkeying around with the game just to save face.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the example they're referencing is not one of those cases. If they put holy shield back on holy power (which is what they were talking about) and remove the CD from Word of Glory (also mentioned), then your choice as a protection paladin becomes whether to use your holy power on Holy Shield or Word of Glory. Holy Shield protects only against physical damage, but is pure mitigation and likely more powerful. Word of Glory is reactive, which is better if you miss using the ability beforehand (or don't have the holy power), and can heal you after you get hit by anything (even magical damage). He mentioned these things specifically, so I'm surprised you didn't see the difference (unless you're just deciding to hate the changes because they're changes, in which case no amount of logic or reason will work I suppose). <br />
<br />
<br />
For a very long time, protection paladins and warriors had to make sure they kept up shield block and/or holy shield at all times, for the sake of avoiding crushing blows. This required the warrior to have enough rage to hit shield block; not really that hard, but still something you could screw up (and letting it fall off at the wrong time could easily get you killed). If they go the &quot;offensive abilities generate resources you use on defensive CDs&quot; route, we'll just be going back to a system more like that, so I really don't see what the big deal is. <br />
<br />
As for tanks self-healing, you're acting like tanks have never self-healed before DK tanks. There were plenty of times I used seal of light as a protadin for some extra regen, not to mention enraged/frenzied regeneration, improved leader of the pack.... sure, they weren't as significant as DK self-healing, and they still aren't. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are a lot of things they could do that I would absolutely hate, but really, overreacting when we have nothing specific yet, and when there are plenty of systems they could use that are just slight variations of what we've had in the past is just silly.</div></div><hr />

I'm not over reacting, I'm just saying it's not gonna push me towards tanking, it's even gonna push me further away from it. It's not the tanking I liked for 3 years. I loved passing hours researching gear on a sandbox, to maximize threat while still being block caped, or/and defense caped. <br />
<br />
Also, I don't consider, but that's just me, seals and such as self healing, since they are more passive and uncontrolled, and don't need the use of a gcd or resources. They help you, but your decision making isn't affected by it, and they don't heal for much, with or without them, if you take several hits from the boss and noone else healed you, you will die anyway. They are technically self healing through yes, but I meant to say, active self healing.<br />
Judgment of light was technically a self healing mechanic, but it had no impact what so ever on the fight, which in the end, just act like a standard raid buff or additional hot, which can translate into more health regen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Holy Shield protects only against physical damage, but is pure mitigation and likely more powerful. Word of Glory is reactive, which is better if you miss using the ability beforehand (or don't have the holy power), and can heal you after you get hit by anything (even magical damage).<br />
If you can have both active, then there is no choice to be made.<br />
From my point of view ( but yes, that's personal, through many people will agree), if you can't use both, then holy shield will always win, since it's something NO ONE else can provide you. heals on the other hand, many people can, even the dps (I sometimes use instant heals on my enh shaman instead of chain/lighting bot when I see some healing problems to help out). I can't give him mitigation, and that's why there will never be a choice if it's mitigation or healing for a tank.<br />
For me, the tank's job is to take the least dmg possible, not to try to heal it. That's why I don't like the self healing mechanisms, that I mention in my first post.</div></div><hr />

Even with the recent threat boost, my warrior still can miss/dodge/parry my initial Shield Slam, Devastate, etc. My paladin missing with a Crusader Strike forces me to wait on Holy Power, although the free 10 expertise glyph helps that some. I'm not saying that abilities need to always hit for tanks, but with fights like Alysrazor where tank dps does matter, we need some amount of hit/expertise as a built-in bonus to taking the tree. I've been one of the few raid tanks I know of who doesn't reforge away hit/expertise. Just a few percent of hit and couple of points of expertise upped my dps in T11 by 1500-2000. So giving us some - not full 8%/26 like melee shoots for - will do two things. Reduce the amount of misses that generate vital resources (DS, CS) and up the dps, which is handy in any fight with an enrage or soft enrage. Tanks don't want to do massive dps (well, okay, some of them do), just a bit more. A couple of k. Without having to sacrifice avoidance/mitigation. It still confuses me how other tanks can hear that in-game *clang* of a missed or parried Shield Block-buffed Shield Slam and not wince. Must be the dpser in me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just because there are a couple bad tanks in top end guilds doesn't mean all top end guild tanks are brain dead and it doesn't mean tanking has a low skill cap. Most of the skill as a tank comes from observation and reacting to things that are happening in the fight and not the actual abilities themselves. The fact that tanks sometimes forget to pop certain things under less obvious circumstances shows that theres more to it than just 'A happened, lets use defensive CD number 2'.</div></div><hr />

For as long as I can remember tanking a boss has always been a joke. You run up, spam a few abilities to hold aggro, maybe you taunt from the other tank once a minute and that's your job done. The thing that bothers me is that there's not a lot of difference between a good tank and an amazing tank, infact the only tank that you actually notice is the moron who cant hold aggro. Active mitigation has the potential to really put the survivability in the hands of the player, making the good players really stand out and make a difference.</div></div><hr />

DK has very slow GCD for catching up 5 mobs within 5 seconds(DnD ticks aren't solid and can be missed). we need to cast outbreak that can miss, pest that can miss along with the mentioned before- solid DnD ticks, that can miss ofc. Blizzard MUST create more fluent AoE tanking meassure. 3. Outbreak never misses which make it still fair compares to other tank due the fact pest and DnD does(unless blizzard design hit rating to have a direct impcat on survivalbility. Design DS like UH scourge stirke for instance, EXP has low impact on it. 4. we all know that we have reletevley more survivalbility tools than other tanks yet Blood doesn't have infinite rune resourses non talking about the slow GCD and the &quot;runic empowerment roulette&quot;. to fix this maybe you should redesign Scent of blood to increase runic regeneration WHILE RUNES ARE ON CD which they are 90% of the time. Doing so and we might bare the 45% chance refreshing method for a bit. 5. Very high avoid and armor are druid trademark . Block is &quot;trademark&quot; of both paladins and warriors. trademarks are kinda passive effect for tanking not like Blood shield that being affected by pure RNG. 6. nerfed armor values+no shield+ survivalbiltiy that being treaten like a roulette is no healthy for tanking.

Blood shield already caps out at your total life so that would work fine.<br />

It's exactly what they're doing. They have a history.<br />

<br />
tl;dr: tanks with shields can stack their block percentage so high that they can max out, i.e. not be hit in an unmitigated way.<br />
<br />
in-depth-explanation:<br />
the combat table (mechanic that defines *how* you're hit as a tank by an npc (and sometimes vice-versa)), looks like this:<br />
(careful,very simplified)<br />
<br />
5% base-miss-chance against same level<br />
X% Dodge<br />
Y% Parry<br />
Z% Block<br />
C% Crit (which you talent away as a tank)<br />
H% Hit (actual unmitigated white dmg)<br />
<br />
Raid-Bosses are 3 levels higher than you (skull), which reduces your chances to be missed/avoid by a total of 2,4%<br />
so you got to hit 102.4% combined percentage with any combination of the above-mentioned stats to push Hit (and crit, in theory) off the table.<br />
which renders you un&quot;hit&quot;able, you will only get hit with at least 30% (block) reduced damage.<br />
Hence, &quot;block capped&quot;.<br />
cause mechanic-wise you can not reach 102,4% by parry or dodge alone.<br />
<br />
<br />
DKs only got parry&amp;dodge<br />
Druids only got dodge<br />
<br />
they're screwed in this model ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tennesseej</div><div class="date">2011-09-01, 12:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">DKs only got parry&amp;dodge<br />

<br />

<br />
So having a higher base stamina bonus and higher armor means nothing? You can make the argument that it's not balanced properly, but you can't make the argument that it isn't somewhat compensated for.<br />
<br />
I think in a theoretical model, where you are taking a steady stream of damage, and receiving a steady stream of heals, each tank remains at the exact same health over time. The problem is the game doesn't play out like this, so on certain fights some tanks might seem better than others. Ultimately all the tanks are viable (people forget Vanilla times when Bears and Paladins had a tank spec, but nobody would run with anything except a Warrior) and they all play a little differently which is what matters most.</div></div><hr />

Lol because having to keep up a rotation (not the most complex one but still a rotation) where you pretty much have to do 3 lacerates to keep Pulverize so you have a bigger chance to get a shield, and still do an attack every GCD without getting rage starved so your shield will proc more often is more passive then a warrior's...ehhh...right he doesn't do anything else then pop shield block every 30 seconds.I know ferals do take less damage then other tanks when both are not blocking or absorbing anything, but healer's don't care about that.

I think he meant that it's the most passive right now because other than increase the chances for something to happen, the druid tank can't do anything to &quot;activate&quot; it or anything.

I never said that all of them were terrible players, just that the amount of 'bad tanks' in top-end guilds was 'fairly astounding.' <br />
<br />
Most of the skill as a tank comes from observation and reacting to things that are happening in the fight and not the actual abilities themselves.<br />
Isn't that a skill all players have to use in majority of fights throughout the game, especially heroics? (Keep in mind, my post is reference to high-end guilds.) If anyone screws up in a fight, typically it has huge consequences. If a dps class doesn't know his proper rotation, he loses tons of dps and risks wiping his raid. If a healer screws up and doesn't heal the right person, that person can die. If a tank fails to use his cooldown.....he can.....live? What? It doesn't make any sense. This is why the skillcap of a tank is lower than most classes and Blizzard wants to make more reactive damage reducing abilities rather than just depending on passive stats. Before, threat could be argued as an important mechanic but honestly it's come to the point where tanks have just become &quot;stat whales&quot; that can just sit there and soak damage half the time. <br />
<br />
The fact that tanks sometimes forget to pop certain things under less obvious circumstances shows that theres more to it than just 'A happened, lets use defensive CD number 2'<br />
The fact you can sometimes forget to use a critical ability while playing in a high-end guild is nothing short of astounding and disgusting. If you screw up you should be punished, not carried through the content by amazing healers. <br />
<br />
All in all, this article is exactly what needs to happen to tanking now that threat isn't an important issue. It will truly separate the baddie tanks from the amazing tanks. Lore, one of the main guys from tankspot, did a video about these coming changes after the threat hotfix and it really makes sense. Check it out if you still disagree: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaLw9q-RrnM&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=489s</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, if Blizzard wants to make tanking more reactive, this kind of delay can't really be allowed to occur. It used to be a bit of issue when threat mattered and even more of one when Prots used to WoG-tank.<br />
<br />
Ok, as I play both a paladin and a DK tank I will flat out tell you: Yes, not generating holy power is irritating, but death strikes missing can be deadly. That is pretty much what it boils down to.<br />
<br />
If you use your example of multiple CS's missing. Say you miss 3 times, that's 13.5 seconds of not getting holy power from CS. Is it a big deal, yes. Is it overcome-able of course.<br />
<br />
In heroic mode FL content I would venture to say that if you missed 3 Death Strikes in a row, at an inopportune time, you just die. No if's, and's or but's, you can't get your DS heal/shield; up you just die.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also: In reference to your statement about making reactive tanking. They aren't planning on making all tanks reactive like DKs in 4.3, that is a long term change.. and would change the entire scope of tanking in general. (More likely to see that in patch 5.0)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocfb4ae2f171</div><div class="date">2011-09-01, 01:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering about certain points while reading it until I was done and saw the name of the writer... <br />
We recently buffed tank threat significantly and suggested that we would fill in any potential lost gameplay with new gameplay. What I meant by that was that if tanks don’t need to hit their buttons to generate threat, they may realize they don’t need to hit most of their buttons at all, and just stand there waiting until the right time to Shield Wall. Going a GCD or two without using a combat ability is fine with us. Standing around much longer than that gets boring quickly. Seriously? Lost gameplay was because of changes of very different mechanics with cata. Buffing threat yesterday was only to silence the players incapable of watching their own threat in random heroics and to satisfy incompetent tanks. I dont see any raidguilds complain about threat issues in their raids. Maybe because they know how to play. Something you dont encourage new or inexperienced players, it was called: L2P! But buffs for those that cant learn is a way better solution... <br />
What we proposed is that tanks should ideally want to hit their buttons because it keeps them alive. I didn’t elaborate on that too much except to say it would feel more like the Blood DK method of tanking, which prompted some players to state that they didn’t like the DK model, or to point out that the DK model is not just active but reactive. Fair enough. Tanks have to move, taunt boss or adds, build up aoe threat on add groups and so on. I dont know what game you are playing but there are no patchwerk fights left in the current or last content. So I really wonder what brainless tank or developer came up with the thought that tanks dont want or need to hit their buttons, be it for dps/threat or a cooldown. <br />
You should occasionally alter your rotation depending on what is going on in the fight, but you should still mitigate regularly and not save everything for the really big, predictable hits. Rotation? What could a DK hit for threat if not just heart strike, death strike and rune strike? Thats a normal boss only &quot;rotation&quot;. There is just no alternative to hit. And if the cooldowns would be required for something else than the &quot;really big, predictable hits&quot;, tanks would use them instead of waiting till the &quot;really big, predictable hits&quot; hit. Why use a CD if it isnt neccessary? <br />
Here are three different models for why hitting buttons can matter to tanks. Building up threat and go afk to jump on your mate for a few mins is possible in what fight exactly? Patchwerk? Or which fight doesnt have &quot;really big, predictable hits&quot; that doesnt require CDs? <br />
I polled all of the class designers who raid Heroic content (which is all of them, I believe) This made me laugh. I´m asking anyway: who of them complained about threat in their raids? <br />
It sucks when Death Strike misses. &quot;Stack hit and expertise&quot; is an answer to that, but not one that's really viable or even fair given that other tanks will care even less about hit and expertise in the short term. Rather than making Death Strike always hit, we’re going to let it always heal you, and proc Blood Shield, even when it misses. This kind of tweak may very well be an interim solution given that everything I said above was that we want tanks to care about hitting to drive their mitigation. But we don’t think it’s fair to penalize the DK for working the “new way” while everyone else is still working the &quot;old way,&quot; and it's too much of a change for 4.3 to apply the &quot;new way&quot; to the other three classes. In the long term, as in the Protadin example above, the rotation can't just be Death Strike, Death Strike, Death Strike... Death Strike. The idea that death strike heals and proccs blood shield when missing its target... Thats the dumbest idea you ever had! And you, mr gc, had some of the best ever. You´re beating your own record with that. You implented hit for tanks/dps and expertise for all melees. If tanks dont use them, their own fault! So it must be fixed for the future. *sarcasm* Good idea *sarcasm off* It is possible to have abit of both and not sacrifice all defensive stats for it. DKs have access to weapons with both and complain for not having it? I know of 3 weapons with those stats. I wonder why there are no 2h weapons with hit or exp in FL. Guess DKs have to find other ways of getting those stats. But hey, exp and hit is cheap. Oh wait, everything must be reforged and socketed to mastery -.- And about paladins and warriors, they have 1h weapons with expertise and hit available. Blood DKs are usually using 2h weapons since someone had a brainfart to make tanking with 2 1h weapons obsolete.</div></div><hr />

I've been a warrior tank in this game since level 54,and it's my prefered style of play. I can play fury, but really don't find it as fun.Homoginizing the tanks to this extent will kill the game for me. I have no desire to play an active midigation system. If I did, I'd be playing myDK full time and not my warrior.Every time I read that article I feel like I die a little inside, it's really depressing to see the hobby I've loved for 7 years be slowly destroyed by an inexperienced and unskilled group of developers. No matter what I've said or think about Tigole, he at least knew what he was doing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This concerns me; Smart tanks IMHO will put as much effort towards survival as required and no more... then they focus on damage, after all 3k is 3k.<br />
<br />
I did 21k tanking shannox heroic this week (used as an example because it is the most patchworky for the tank without any random 1000% buffs or downtime) so I might be an edge case... but I see nothing wrong with the idea that tanks should do damage. <br />
<br />
Of course if we hit a point where my healers are struggling, I'll swap some stats around, but really as long as they can heal me, killing the boss faster helps them more than 1% dodge or whatever.<br />
<br />
I also strongly make the argument that being hitcapped for a warrior so your thunderclap and demoshout don't miss is important, and also since thunderclap can't be dodged/parried, being hitcapped with blood and thunder means you never have to worry about rend falling off either or getting dodged/parried trying to reapply it.<br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind a system where revenge or devastate or something gives me rage instead of boss swings (though since revenge is dependent on boss swings I guess that makes it a double dependency, so probably not a good one to pick if you are listening GC). ...but please don't keep rage the way it is and give me combo points to worry about on top of it, rage is dumb now, since it is pretty much irrelevant when I'm getting hit, but if a boss stops to cast a spell (like the eyeball guy in BH, does constantly) it is very easy to run out of rage... and I'd hate to see a boss design like that, where I'm still guardrail to guardrail and potentially will be expected to build combo points for an oncoming onslaught while ragestarved or keep them banked for a ridiculous amount of time.<br />
<br />
I also worry that DKs are going to get massively nerfed shortly after they get the buffs discussed here, because it seems like blizz will be taking something that might be considered overpowered in the hands of 1%, removing the skillcap, and handing something overpowered to the other 99. Which is probably fine in PVE, but I can only imagine how much complaining there will be when this proposed Blood DK is carrying a flag in a rated bg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get the vibe that they'd genuinely love to make a lot of changes (that, overall, sound like they'd be excellent for the game), but they can't because their hands are tied by external forces (whether that's bean-counter (executive) producers, large groups of intransigent players, or even just a total lack of man-power). And for the first time ever, because I get that vibe from this blog, I actually feel some sympathy/empathy for the dev team. :o (no sarcasm)<br />

<br />
Isn't that a skill all players have to use in majority of fights throughout the game, especially heroics? (Keep in mind, my post is reference to high-end guilds.) If anyone screws up in a fight, typically it has huge consequences. If a dps class doesn't know his proper rotation, he loses tons of dps and risks wiping his raid. If a healer screws up and doesn't heal the right person, that person can die. If a tank fails to use his cooldown.....he can.....live? What? It doesn't make any sense. This is why the skillcap of a tank is lower than most classes and Blizzard wants to make more reactive damage reducing abilities rather than just depending on passive stats. Before, threat could be argued as an important mechanic but honestly it's come to the point where tanks have just become &quot;stat whales&quot; that can just sit there and soak damage half the time. <br />
<br />
The fact you can sometimes forget to use a critical ability while playing in a high-end guild is nothing short of astounding and disgusting. If you screw up you should be punished, not carried through the content by amazing healers. <br />
<br />
All in all, this article is exactly what needs to happen to tanking now that threat isn't an important issue. It will truly separate the baddie tanks from the amazing tanks. Lore, one of the main guys from tankspot, did a video about these coming changes after the threat hotfix and it really makes sense. Check it out if you still disagree: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaLw9q-RrnM&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=489s<br />
<br />
Semi-interesting video but i don't think it's the solution and i don't think its worth blizzard spending the time on. Tanks will still be pressing the same buttons in a priority system as they do now. The buffs you gain from these abilities can't really last more than a few seconds with the need to be refreshed otherwise you kinda remove the whole point to it. This seems like it can never be that major of a feature in tanking without creating something like DKs deathstrike that actually shields you for significant amounts and scales with mastery. It's really just a gimmick thats not worth the development time and won't bring any enjoyment to tanking. As i said in my other post, right now we're hitting buttons in a priority order for threat and now it'll be the exact same thing but for damage reduction, whats the point in taking tanking in this direction? It's the exact same shit except this time instead of the nonsense reasons that tanks apparently fail/wipe groups (generating threat) the main reason they'll wipe the group is cuz they take shitloads of damage if they dont know their rotation which will be far more common. If this isn't true (ie. its not a major major consistent damage reduction), then the change will be so tiny they've effectively just eliminated the need for threat generation and spent a bunch of development time to give us nothing. Great. Now whats the point in &quot;seperating&quot; good tanks from bad with this? lol.. its pointless and will create more issues in pugs if thats what you're worried about. In top raiding guilds who cares? They will sort it out and its not even worth talking about.<br />
<br />
Tanks will no longer have to worry about threat and according to this video the main reason tanks are kicked from a group is because they can't hold threat. Well, that's nonsense. Most of the time when a tank is kicked it's because he's ignoring CC when its actually necessary, not being observant, not talking with the group (non english speaker), acting like an asshole because he thinks he's can do whatever he wants etc. Usually a combination of those is required for a tank to get kicked but i can barely ever even think of a time when a tank was kicked because he couldn't hold threat. That's complete garbage. <br />
<br />
It's one of those ideas that sounds like it might be good but it's just going to be a disaster and a complete waste of development time. I cba playing a DK style warrior tank.<br />
<br />
He talks about healers / dps and how they need to heal people or else they die and know their rotations to pump out max DPS. Then says what do tanks actually have to do other than sit there and let it beat on u and pop a defensive CD every now and then? Well, we worry about the positioning of the mobs we're tanking.. what abilities do they have? do they cleave? tail whip? etc? do i have to reposition the mob/boss ? how many stacks of the debuff does my offtank have? when does the CC end on the add? do i need to charge/interrupt? when should i pop trinkets? should i save shield block (its rare but it happens)? can i reposition the boss into a better spot when its my turn to taunt off? do i need to move the boss more to help the melee avoid better? semi-redundant now but.. can i intervene a high threat DPS? should i intervene the offtank or another (with safeguard) to reduce his damage taken or soak the incoming attacks? how can i use heroic leap the best? etc etc. Most of the time when raiding ur communicating with your guildies and if there is any downtime it's extremely valueable that it's there as theres a lot of other stuff going on and it gives u time to think about what ur next moves are.</div></div><hr />

This seems like it can never be that major of a feature in tanking without creating something like DKs deathstrike that actually shields you for significant amounts and scales with mastery.<br />
First off, assuming tanks will always have the same rotation is pretty naive. The rotation of every tank has changed many times over the years, typically it was based around holding aggro but now the playing field has changed it will be to reduce incoming damage. A raid encounter could live or die by the skill of your tank, regardless of how good your healers are. The buffs you could gain from doing a proper damage reducing rotation could be massive. Your entire evasion setup could be built around what keys you press and when. <br />
<br />
It's really just a gimmick thats not worth the development time and won't bring any enjoyment to tanking. As i said in my other post, right now we're hitting buttons in a priority order for threat and now it'll be the exact same thing but for damage reduction, whats the point in taking tanking in this direction? Not really, right now a tank is basically a dps class with 1) gear that allows him to take more damage than normal dps class and 2) Short cooldowns that lower the incoming damage. If anything, the current way of tanking is extremely gimmicky and is nothing more than gear now that threat has been removed.<br />
<br />
It's the exact same shit except this time instead of the nonsense reasons that tanks apparently fail/wipe groups (generating threat) the main reason they'll wipe the group is cuz they take shitloads of damage if they dont know their rotation which will be far more common.<br />
Then people will have to learn their rotation like any other class? If a dps doesn't know his rotation, he does terrible dps. If a healer doesn't know the proper healing spells, people die and groups wipe. Now when a tank doesn't know his rotation, he will die. This is exactly how it should be. <br />
<br />
Now whats the point in &quot;separating*&quot; good tanks from bad with this? lol.. its pointless and will create more issues in pugs if thats what you're worried about. In top raiding guilds who cares? They will sort it out and its not even worth talking about. What's the point of having competitive leagues in any type of game? Some players want to be recognized for the efforts they put into the game, tanks should be no different. If you don't want to be a good tank, don't try. It's that easy. God forbid we have to learn to try at anything we do in life.<br />
<br />
Tanks will no longer have to worry about threat and according to this video the main reason tanks are kicked from a group is because they can't hold threat. Well, that's nonsense.

That's complete garbage. It's just one example of how tanks could be bad in the past and how the changes are covering up for tanks that don't know how to generate threat. It's far from garbage. Lore is raider in a top-end guild and has been an active and influential member of TankSpot for about the last 5-6 years. His opinions are pretty valid. Trash talking someone of his status just makes you look silly.<br />
<br />
It's one of those ideas that sounds like it might be good but it's just going to be a disaster and a complete waste of development time. I cba playing a DK style warrior tank. Again, that's just your opinion. It would seem that a lot of other people think otherwise. If you don't like it or think it's too hard, go play another game or perhaps another class that has an easier rotation.<br />
<br />
He talks about healers / dps and how they need to heal people or else they die and know their rotations to pump out max DPS. Then says what do tanks actually have to do other than sit there and let it beat on u and pop a defensive CD every now and then? He's right. One of the few skillful abilities tanks had was 1) Aggro generation 2) Survivability cooldowns. The simple fact that tanks can get carried so far and be so terrible at the game shows a huge disconnect from the actual tanking involving with taking and reducing incoming damage. Playing a dps class would at least including me watching my surroundings while maintaining a good dps roation. The same can be said for a healer, if I don't do my job and watch for my own survivability, people will die. If I don't do a good threat rotation on a tank and forget to hit my cooldowns, who cares? The healers can carry me to victory! Yeah, that shouldn't work, ever.<br />
<br />
Well, we worry about the positioning of the mobs we're tanking.. what abilities do they have? do they cleave? tail whip? etc? do i have to reposition the mob/boss ? how many stacks of the debuff does my offtank have? when does the CC end on the add? do i need to charge/interrupt? when should i pop trinkets? should i save shield block (its rare but it happens)? can i reposition the boss into a better spot when its my turn to taunt off? do i need to move the boss more to help the melee avoid better? semi-redundant now but.. can i intervene a high threat DPS? should i intervene the offtank or another (with safeguard) to reduce his damage taken or soak the incoming attacks? how can i use heroic leap the best? etc etc.Congratulation, 90% of the stuff you listed is the same stuff that dps or healers have to worry about. Almost none of it is unique to tanking. <br />
<br />
Most of the time when raiding ur communicating with your guildies and if there is any downtime it's extremely valueable that it's there as theres a lot of other stuff going on and it gives u time to think about what ur next moves are. That's the problem. You have all this extra time to chat with your friends and think about your next moves? In wow you can perform, at most, maybe 120 apm? Playing a tank you could get away doing 10 or 20 APM while forgetting to hit your major cooldowns, which is what a child could do. It's pathetic. Pro SC2 players hold onto 200-300 APM just to make sure they win. Tanking is a joke right now and it would seem the devs agree. Get ready for some changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
See a lot of people mentioning the shield and seem to have missed the healing part. If it didn't use runes when it missed this would be way too OP. And I am a DK tank. Simple fix though, make it use the runes even if missed. I read in a post earlier that they could add some passive +hit/expertise to tank builds which I don't think was a bad ideas. <br />
<br />
I kinda like the make tank dps model matter. I see they are worried about tanks trying to gear for haste/crit/etc. If they did a passive +hit/expertise, maybe into a 1 point talent for all tanks deep in the tree, and then add a talent to each tank tree that adds +(insert a decent dps stat) as a % of (insert good tank stat) could make it so that gearing is not so crazy in that model. Could even roll both of these into a decent 3 point talent deep in tree so we still have enough points for other things, but makes it worth getting for sure. Dunno just random brainstorming here really, but there is potential.<br />
<br />
Anyway I think the blog has some really good ideas, that could be good for all tanks. Obviously they are not final set in stone ideas. And I'm sure they will need tweaking and balancing. For instance, some pallies talking about CS proccing HP even on miss. If they did the DK changes like this I think only fair to add this for pallys too.</div></div><hr />

Solution: Make it always heal and Proc Blood shield even if it misses. That has got to be the dumbest solution ever devised.

Quit your jibbajabba if you cant beat a Blood DK then your just a bad player, you should spend less time on forums and more time researching your class or learning how not to click.<br />
<br />
Blood DK's in PVE are borderline tanks atm at best most guilds are sitting them out due to having unreliable mitigation (ds miss/parry)/ damage spikes/ utter shit at tanking adds etc etc. These changed are needed to make us &quot;viable&quot; again end game at the moment we are the &quot;none optimal&quot; tank you take only because your a friend of the guild. Anyone with a brain would take a block caped paladin/ druid or a warrior over a DK at the moment as they are so far behind. #<br />

Seriously? Lost gameplay was because of changes of very different mechanics with cata. Buffing threat yesterday was only to silence the players incapable of watching their own threat in random heroics and to satisfy incompetent tanks. I dont see any raidguilds complain about threat issues in their raids. Maybe because they know how to play. Something you dont encourage new or inexperienced players, it was called: L2P! But buffs for those that cant learn is a way better solution... Tanks have to move, taunt boss or adds, build up aoe threat on add groups and so on. I dont know what game you are playing but there are no patchwerk fights left in the current or last content. So I really wonder what brainless tank or developer came up with the thought that tanks dont want or need to hit their buttons, be it for dps/threat or a cooldown. Rotation? What could a DK hit for threat if not just heart strike, death strike and rune strike? Thats a normal boss only &quot;rotation&quot;. There is just no alternative to hit. And if the cooldowns would be required for something else than the &quot;really big, predictable hits&quot;, tanks would use them instead of waiting till the &quot;really big, predictable hits&quot; hit. Why use a CD if it isnt neccessary? Building up threat and go afk to jump on your mate for a few mins is possible in what fight exactly? Patchwerk? Or which fight doesnt have &quot;really big, predictable hits&quot; that doesnt require CDs? This made me laugh. I´m asking anyway: who of them complained about threat in their raids? The idea that death strike heals and proccs blood shield when missing its target... Thats the dumbest idea you ever had! And you, mr gc, had some of the best ever. You´re beating your own record with that. You implented hit for tanks/dps and expertise for all melees. If tanks dont use them, their own fault! So it must be fixed for the future. *sarcasm* Good idea *sarcasm off* It is possible to have abit of both and not sacrifice all defensive stats for it. DKs have access to weapons with both and complain for not having it? I know of 3 weapons with those stats. I wonder why there are no 2h weapons with hit or exp in FL. Guess DKs have to find other ways of getting those stats. But hey, exp and hit is cheap.

I've known that if I stop attacking, my shield will fall more and I'll take more damage because my &quot;block&quot; will come down.But the DK went a bit far to the extreme - it was supposed to be a partner for the druid, akin to paladin/warrior... but they decided to wreck it with this whole self-healing rubbish.Giving tanks active mitigation akin to a druid tank would be great<br />
<br />
I don't think savage defence is particularly active. It's not like you think &quot;i'll choose to crit now, to proc savage defence&quot;.<br />
<br />
Getting a better rotation with more moves in might give you more crits, and more uptime, but is that really active? you're just doing that already anyway surely. When the boss starts to hit hard, you can't choose to do more crits. What I mean is, whilst they are related they are not really active. It's more like playing a dps class and having a good rotation makes u survive more. Which is fine don't get me wrong, but it's not really &quot;active&quot; in that sense, its very passive.</div></div><hr />

First Blizzard decides to boost tank threat and now they need to rework how tanking works to not make it boring... What about just lowering the threat buff so we still have to work to have threat instead of having to rework the classes completely? And please, do NOT make a new ressource like holy power or similar. The fun part about WoW is not pushing as many buttons as possible while watching several energy ressources... The fun part is killing bosses, PvP'ing etc. And do not even consider buffing Death Strike - It is already among the top 3 most OP abilities in the entire game and that doesn NOT need another insane buff! In fact it should be nerfed to the ground seeing that no other class can selfheal anywhere close to a blood DK. It's gotten to the point that in PvP they are almost impossible to kill due to that single ability and once that is combined with all the other abilities they have you might as well just make them immune to damage. I understand why you gave classes selfheal abilities but it's not supposed to be this OP! The hunter selfheal is crap to say the least and this one can be used a lot more and heals for insane amounts - A tank is not supposed to survive without a healer... It's the healers job to heal!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Frazzle.d</div><div class="date">2011-09-01, 12:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So a PvPer's biggest concern is that a DK will now heal more often because they aren't missing? Last time I checked, you could be hit-capped for PvP without even reforging your gear, so nobody is missing anybody in PvP the way it is now. This is purely a PvE change.Honestly, I'm looking forward to the tank changes to come as well. As a pally tank, I'd like it very much if they fixed Holy Power to be useful for something besides WoG. If they actually make our skills play off each other a bit better, and have lasting effects beyond &quot;This skill gives you 1 combo point&quot;, then it could potentially be a lot of fun. It will be interesting to see how things develop for the next patch/expansion.<br />
<br />
Not quite. PvP concern is that Death Strike will always land - while it may not cause the damage it'll still be granting the substantial heal - regardless of what that other player is doing or had rolled. Nobody always hits or lands a blow in pvp. Evasion? Death Strike. Other tank class in pvp who either need to rely on cooldowns or cast heals? Death Strike. Night elf racial avoidance? Death Strike. Base block, dodge and parry rating on player characters? Death Strike. <br />
<br />
It's such an incredibly unbelievable buff that's came out of nowhere for a solution to a problem that wasn't even that much of an issue in the first place. I didn't see anyone complaining that blood wasn't viable as a tank spec, iit's a pretty popular spec in pvp and pve. The Bone Shield buff is a nice quality of life change, but the better idea with DS would have just been to roll expertise / hit into one of the existing talents, as someone else said. <br />
<br />
I do not understand the logic here when he says in one blog he wants to keep skill and reactive play strong, then seems to do a U turn and come up with something that makes the more in depth tanking class that takes away some of the skill and spice that made it more interesting, especially after the threat and crowd control buffs.</div></div><hr />

I havent been negative about the huge changes since WotLK, but now i am.

GC said it's a band-aid fix because they can't rework the tank classes for 4.3.<br />
Rather than making Death Strike always hit, we’re going to let it always heal you, and proc Blood Shield, even when it misses. This kind of tweak may very well be an interim solution given that everything I said above was that we want tanks to care about hitting to drive their mitigation. <br />
<br />
Besides: Wayne PvP? This whole Game has gone to hell (PvE wise) because of this stupid Arena minigame and Blizzards futile attempt to make every spec viable under any given condition.</div></div><hr />

Dk is my main which main spec is dps, but I've enjoyed tanking until cata started. Since cata started I've been waiting and waiting for them to get rid of this clunky style of tanking that is just downright dumb and now they want other classes to have it too? Tank numbers are already in a low, now they want to make tanking less fun. I foresee many other tanks like myself not tanking anymore. A lot of people like playing warrior tanks because its not like a dk. Hell that's why I leveled a warrior and tank with it, its so much more fun on my warrior tank to never have to deal with deathstrike....<br />

Tanks can already die if a healer messes up, I don't want to think of how many wipes will come when a tank will die because of the tank messing up along with the healers.<br />

honestly you don't want them to put your class in focus, you only have to look what happened the last time they did that to a class (i.e. Paladin).<br />

We have berserk timers or other DPS checks on a lot of our encounters. Typically tank DPS isn’t taken seriously on these fights, which is a little puzzling at first glance. Yes, the tank may not be able to match the Enhance shaman for damage done, but also consider that the Enhance shaman would absolutely love it if she could improve her DPS by a paltry 3K. That 3K may be enough to meet that DPS check. Note that I’m not talking about tanks being able to beat out skilled DPS players; I think most of us agree that would be a little bizarre. But that doesn’t mean tank damage has to be a non-factor either. Sure, the Feral tank may be doing 16K DPS to the shaman’s 30K, but 3K is 3K. In my limited mind, all I see is another reason not to bring an enhance shaman to the raid, if the boss required only 1 tank, only well the other tank is going to be putting out as much dps as the enhance shaman... YES I see the section where they mention &quot;not a much dmg done&quot;, but we all know how things really go, fix one thing break ten more.Enchance behind over.. Time to get it from the tanks..</div></div><hr />

You look forward so this?:<br />
Currently a miss with death strike uses no runes. If the new death strike uses runes at a miss, its still OP. <br />
If it continues to cost no runes when missing, a DK could just spam death strike while playing without any hit and hope to miss, because it will always heal the dk and procc blood shield. A blood DK without any hit will still hit alot and a miss will remove the CD on death strike in that situation.<br />
<br />
Both situations are no viable solutions, be it pvp or pve.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woeful</div><div class="date">2011-09-01, 04:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Here is what I think Blizzard is doing:<br />
<br />
Blizzard is in the process of designing the new expansion raids. One of the ways to tune the boss fights is to vary the damage according to the likely skill level of the targeted player. For instance, in normal mode Blizzard may want the majority of the guilds to kill the boss. The tank, be him/her new or experienced can play active mitigation component of tanking in fair to good manner, and the raid still can defeat the encounter. A bad tank would be put more stress on the healers and the raid wipes ultimately. A good tank makes the encounter much easier, an excellent tank makes the encounter a breeze. The mitigation tools allows Blizzard to re-tune the boss fights to more casual players. It allows them to remove some of the annoying aoe damage, and allows them to increase situational awareness. &quot;Boss raises right hand in anger&quot; &quot;Better use my blood shield pool, holy word, shield block/wall or survival instincts.&quot; Instead of having bosses that are just &quot;gear checks&quot;, the boss ca be a mitigation check. Has the tank learned to use his mitigation tactics well? If yes, the boss will be defeated, if no, then the raid will wipe until the tank learns.<br />
<br />
In heroic modes, Blizzard can really amp up the damage, and force the tank to play at a good to exceptional level in order to defeat the encounter. They can force the healers to heal well and force the dps to push out the numbers. They can add more annoying aoe to distract the healers, and can force the encounter to fail because the tank did not mitigate correctly. They can do this in the form of ever increasing damage. If a good but not excellent tank, steps into a heroic raid, the healers can run out of mana, no matter the gear level. When an excellent tank mitigates the damage, the healers have enough mana, provided they are reasonably geared for the encounter. <br />
<br />
This mechanic will separate the hard-core players from the casual players and will allow the hard-core to crow about their accomplishments, not because they can blow through the gear level faster, but because they play better. Their tanks, healer and dps are all better.<br />
<br />
It won't all be about getting better gear to defeat the encounter, because better gear increases the tanks passive mitigation. It will be more about, the tank having to shield block correctly, push the buttons intelligently, use self heals and active mitigation, and plan the cool-downs for lower and higher damage phases. The gear will make it easier, but it won't make up for the lack of skill level.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dejohn</div><div class="date">2011-09-01, 05:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Its kinda funny that a paladin tank at the launch of cata was exactly like model 3 and was exactly how they want to go forward until they decided to nerf the hell out of Holy Power generation with misses not generating anything and a 20s CD on WoG. <br />
<br />
I do also hope that going forward they stop with the silly 2pc bonuses for tanking classes, its usually a useless threat boost, I would have always rather had pure mitigation bonuses. If they are going to keep threat bonuses then make them interesting like after you pop such and such your attacks cannot miss or be dodged/parried for x seconds. At least it would help at the very beginning of a fight or when you have to pick up an add instead of your attacks missing 6x in a row.</div></div><hr />

See a lot of people mentioning the shield and seem to have missed the healing part. If it didn't use runes when it missed this would be way too OP. And I am a DK tank. Simple fix though, make it use the runes even if missed. <br />

No class is necessarily &quot;fun&quot;, maybe healing can be &quot;fun&quot; because of the challenges in managing hp/mana etc but is dps &quot;fun&quot;? is a mage 1-button spamming &quot;fun&quot;? In pve, the fun is in downing a boss, progression as a guild and gaining loot. Further than that its to hang out and play with your group of friends in the guild. Everyone spends hours wiping over and over and that is no &quot;fun&quot;. If raids were like instant respawn at the boss (Looking for raid tool style) then that would certainly remove the boredom of running back in every wipe. But making tank design decisions based on a subjective value of &quot;fun&quot; is the wrong way to go about addressing the tanking issue.<br />

They have to stack all these stats that just aren't needed in Arena play and its such a bother that no PvP sets have tank stats... as in, welcome to the hell healers went through - an expansion aimed to fix arenas first had to whack healers after attempting to wipe burst effects off the charts. Well tanks were obviously up next because they don't have stats conducive to Arena play, worse some play so much better than others. Still there is a woeful imbalance among tanks as it is. While they should not duplicate each others abilities exactly a lot of what they do should behave the same. Like taunts, there is no reason each has different taunts let alone how they execute (paladin taunt is absolute easiest to manage - you don't even target the mob to make it work). Some tanks have it easier because they can always front load their threat/damage on a pull even against groups while others have to build resources to do the same. Even the multi target attacks don't work the same (not same number of targets or on different cool downs - you name it) Bear tanking annoys me because I am not really in control of my damage shield, it just sort of happens. Whereas on the DK I can make it happen provided I didn't blow the resources. My Pally feels like the DK, I can horde resources far easier than the DK. My warrior - damn if all tanks played as mean as they did I would be happy. Warrior tanking is visceral, the others are trying to reach the same level of aggressiveness but just don't have it. Now all we need is to force DPS back into mana management.</div></div><hr />

Looking at how many DK's there is in the top 0.001% of arena teams is just plain dumb and says absolutely NOTHING about class balance!<br />
<br />
Sure it's possible to kill a Blood DK but a good blood DK is almost impossible to kill... Their selfhealing is insane - It doesn't require a genius to figure out that a selfheal of minimum 7% that can be used again and again(Only limited by ressources) and which can stack with the shield is pretty damn insane and by far OP compared to any other selfheal in the game. Going up against a DK with 4K+ resil and half your abilities only hit for 2-3K but the 190K HP DK can heal for at least 7% each time.... Do the math!</div></div><hr />

Do you guys actually play the game or just sit around finding new ways to make us go OH %^&amp;% it and go play something else.&quot;This, to be honest. Tanking is a crappy job thanks to the people most of the time. Just when things started to improve, now you want to screw it up again. Do you know since the threat change, my maximum queue time as dps has been 15 minutes? Before it was closer to 45. The change is actually encouraging people to try tanking, or come back to tanking. Healers went from fun in Wrath to craptastic in Cata, and now you are giving tanks the same treatment. Give it a rest already. Start messing about with DPS so they have to jump through hoops to do their job or see their biggest crits land for a third of what they did last xpac, and take 3 times as long to cast. Get a clue.</div></div><hr />

They have to stack all these stats that just aren't needed in Arena play and its such a bother that no PvP sets have tank stats... as in, welcome to the hell healers went through - an expansion aimed to fix arenas first had to whack healers after attempting to wipe burst effects off the charts. Well tanks were obviously up next because they don't have stats conducive to Arena play, worse some play so much better than others. Still there is a woeful imbalance among tanks as it is. While they should not duplicate each others abilities exactly a lot of what they do should behave the same. Like taunts, there is no reason each has different taunts let alone how they execute (paladin taunt is absolute easiest to manage - you don't even target the mob to make it work). Some tanks have it easier because they can always front load their threat/damage on a pull even against groups while others have to build resources to do the same. Even the multi target attacks don't work the same (not same number of targets or on different cool downs - you name it) Bear tanking annoys me because I am not really in control of my damage shield, it just sort of happens. Whereas on the DK I can make it happen provided I didn't blow the resources. My Pally feels like the DK, I can horde resources far easier than the DK. My warrior - damn if all tanks played as mean as they did I would be happy. Warrior tanking is visceral, the others are trying to reach the same level of aggressiveness but just don't have it. Now all we need is to force DPS back into mana management.<br />
<br />
So PVE gear for PVE specs doesn't have stats one would want for PVP. Big problem that needs to be fixed? Is the joke your post?</div></div><hr />

Not everyone is stuck in heroics, you know. Some people actually raid and guess what, DK tanks are horrid in Firelands.<br />
<br />
As for PvP concerns, I'm sure Blizzard hears you, but in all fairness, PvEwise they're in such a bad shape that this should have priority right now.</div></div><hr />

All so Shannox... you know why there are so many DKs Tanking not in Raids? Because they even don't know what to do and couldn't role a blood dk well. And well palying DK Tanks don't get quite often the chance to prove it, because Warriors/Pals and Druid Tanks are well situated in raids ... you mostly see Frost DKs in Raids or barely Unholy...<br />
<br />
With a DK Tank you could even manage doin' heroic runs in cataclysm instance without a healer, maybe a shadow for some group support... i tried 5 instance in cataclysm ann all worked without a main healer, support healing is enough.<br />
<br />
As well the DPS fights in FL or in Hardmode require a big time aggro from first pull and warrios/pals and druids got quit a lot of initiating aggro meanwhile the DK Tank needs to role more DPS to generate thread, but with 2 T12 und breakout and the first Deathstrike landed, none can match a well played DK Tank. That is also for group tanking, DK is best suited for that.</div></div><hr />

This. I play frost/unholy on my dk but our mt for fl including heroics is a dk tank. This has been a HUGE issue since dk's were introduced to the game. Due to the different playstyle you wind up with a lot of REALLY bad dk's. Especially tanking dk's. In truth, dk tanks are perfectly fine as they are right now. It's sad how devs have to cater to all the complaints. I hate to be &quot;that guy&quot; but learn to play. I mean honestly, this IS one of the easiest mmo's out there.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mybuddyphil</div><div class="date">2011-09-05, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Sounds like some good changes to me. I'd rather see boring, but balanced changes, than huge imbalanced ones. Blizz could have just waited til the next expansion to do anything, but that would have kinda, sucked right? Cataclysm seems like the most polished expansion by quite a bit, although Deathwing doesn't have that same anticipation as the Lich King did in WotLK. The Deathwing fight(s) sounds like we may get an overload of lore behind him, which is good because I think we need some catch-up as to what he's been doing besides flying around and breathing fire. As far as class balance, this has been the best expansion I've experienced (from BC to now). Remember prot pallies at level 60? Or prot warriors in BC? Retadin damage output or PvP survival-to-DPS ability almost every other patch in BC and WotLK? Or how low top-end guild Shaman DPS was in WotLK? How often did you see a DK or Feral Tank tank adds on H anub? All tanking classes are viable now, all DPS classes are viable now. More DPS specs have become viable. All healer specs are viable now.</div></div><hr />

Also people balancing their own class tend to ignore the boundary between balanced and overpowered every noticed how when someone's class is overpowered they always think it's find and doesnt need changes? Blizzard balance classes the way they think it will work without any bias towards classes.Also you dont go into someone else's house sit down and watch TV with them and say change the channel I don't like this.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Felaful</div><div class="date">2011-09-25, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So are they buffing ALL tank threat or just Blood DK tank threat? If its just DK tank threat, it just makes them even more OP than they've always been this entire expansion. They are already almost impossible to kill, and now they are just gonna be able to spam buttons and take threat off of anyone they please. Threat, mitigation? They are literally making DKs the best class in the game, and yet they still fail to realize that just because it's called a &quot;Hero Class&quot; doesn't mean it should automatically be more powerful than every other class in the game, or give off any indication that its better than every other class. They are like the only class that can solo any enemy they encounter. Never seen anyone else solo bosses like yogg one light, and lich king.<br />
<br />
Last expansion, toward the end, my raid group of 25 had issues with one light. We weren't bad, it was just a hard encounter, and now a blood DK cna go and solo it because 1) they have unlimited self healing, a huge damage output that allows them to beat enrage timers, and they take little to no damage. It's ridiculous. They ruined this expansion, clearly, but not just because of revamped content, and little to no new content, and all of the glitches and problems, but also because of their serious issues with balancing things, particularly class balances.<br />
<br />
By now, they know how OP DKs are, and yet they continue to give them more, more damage reduction, more self healing, more threat, more DPS output in general, even as a tank. They are just being stubborn now because they clearly don't care. They completely took self healing abilities away from classes like the paladin. Rogues can STILL heal themselves more than a paladin can (provided that paladin isn't specced holy).<br />
<br />
I may or may not look at this last content to see if they at least end this expansion on a decent note, but I didn't even pay any attention to this last content patch. I very seriously doubt their next expansion is gonna come close to record-breaking sales like the last two have. Not after this mess. Half a year, and this expansion is coming to a close. Why? Because it is BAD.<br />
<br />
If Ghostcrawler would stop stroking his e-peen and start listening to the players, and looking at all the game reviews and ratings as far as content, he would realize that &quot;hey, we lost a million players in half a year,maybe I'm doing something wrong.&quot; Instead he still keeps on with his big talk on how cool the next content patch is, and what HE feels the players want or SHOULD want. Ghostcrawler, buddy, it's not about what you want, it's about what the consumers want. Go take a business course and you'll learn that if you ignore your consumers, you will FAIL. Even your employees are showing signs of depression after this &quot;Cataclysmic&quot; train wreck. I would know, I've worked with a few of em.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pvpKILLSwow</div><div class="date">2011-09-25, 02:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I wouldn't mind a change to tanking. <br />
When I tank I do try to hit the expertise cap cause it annoys me if an attack is parried or dodged. I can't land them all but I try to. I give a great effort to beat the other DPS classes as a tank.<br />
<br />
From what I have noticed as a warrior tank it seems like besides knowing the obvious mechanics of a fight and reacting accordingly nothing else matters as long as I have threat.<br />
So there really isn't anything else for me to do besides trying to out do the DPS as a tank or just wait for that one moment that I need to taunt or use a holy shit button.<br />
<br />
I know a lot of people will say that's my job: Keep threat. I'd like tanking to feel more responsible for keeping myself alive and for tank damage to be more important.<br />
