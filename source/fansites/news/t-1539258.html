Warlords of Draenor - Druid Mythic Tier 17 Armor Set<br />
We previously looked at the Normal Druid Tier 17 set here (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/druidTier17.jpg), which was missing a helm. Today we are taking a look at the Mythic Tier 17 set, which includes animated wings.<br />
<br />
You can see two of the more popular druid races towards the end of the high quality preview video, or try the set on any race you would like with the modelviewer below.<br />

Doubleagent - Level 90 Neutral Pandaren<br />
Doubleagent, the Neutral Pandaren has finally hit level 90! You can find more information, such as the time it took him to level to 90 (173.5 days) in this FAQ (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/321069-doubleagent-hits-level-90/#post1) on the Blue Post Tracker. <br />

Character Viewer Updated: Female Orc!<br />
Glory. Power. Victory.<br />
<br />
The daughter of Draenor (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/#characters) stands ready to achieve all three, thanks to new visual and animation updates we're making to the female Orc model in the next World of Warcraft expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;div class=&quot;gallery&quot; id=&quot;femorcgal&quot;&gt;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/thumb/image-1-ORCFfull.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/image-1-ORCFfull.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/thumb/image-2-ORCFfull.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/image-2-ORCFfull.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/thumb/image-3-ORCFfull.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/image-3-ORCFfull.jpg)&lt;/div&gt; <br />
<br />
In making changes to the model for Warlords of Draenor, the World of Warcraft art team (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/12845268) wanted to evoke the spirit of the original while making sure her new representation felt even more alive and vivid than before. But don't just take our word for it—see for yourself! We’ve updated the character viewer on the Warlords of Draenor website (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/#characters) with the new female Orc model and new emote screenshots. We hope you enjoy them!<br />
<br />
As development continues on Warlords of Draenor, we’ll show you even more of the updated character models. Let us know what you think!<br />

Alpha Realms Offline - June 20-23<br />
The next Alpha build should be here early this week, opening Shadowmoon Valley and the Alliance characters.<br />
We're in the process of bringing down the Alpha realms while we work to resolve this issue. Unfortunately, it's going to require an updated build, which we won't be able to finish today. Realms will remain offline over the weekend while we get everything ironed out. We hope to be able to bring the Alpha back up on Monday, June 23rd.<br />
<br />
Again, we greatly appreciate your patience during this time. We'll get you back to Draenor as soon as we possibly can.<br />
<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k))<br />
the &quot;of the black harvest title&quot; is character specific to the warlock that earned it, correct?<br />
Yes, only warlocks can use the title. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476512660968570880))<br />
So 2 90 locks on same account, one with, one without the achievement, do both have title?<br />
Yes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476514489639006209))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
I freakin' LOVE the idea of scenarios that take us through old instances. LOVE. Colour me excited!<br />
I hate to dampen enthusiasm but I wouldn't think of these as scenarios. More like a direction/goals overlay on our dungeons. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476510366294241280))<br />
Yeah that's gonna maybe need a rename. People will start calling everything a scenario <br />
The word &quot;scenario&quot; will not appear in the final dungeon UI. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476510911469846528))<br />
More guidance regarding what you're supposed to do, and the ability for us to reward bonus gold/XP for killing optional bosses (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476510489770352640))<br />
Is this for levelling up characters? Will it grant rewards repeatedly to make DG lvling smoother?<br />
Yes, that's another benefit. We're moving a lot of the dungeon XP from one-time quests to repeatable objectives. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476514066282725377))<br />
<br />
Did Garrosh learn some new moves? He switched up his rotation (defile/whirling corruption) a couple of times in P2.<br />
It's always been mostly a coin-flip based on AI timing for that second Desecrate/Whirl in p2; they both come off cooldown at once. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476535136406626305))<br />
<br />
Ah, does a level 80 in 300 gear become invincible to attacks, including 25HC LK? Not that it really concerns you at this point<br />
By the current logic, yes, though that logic isn't by any means final. That breakpoint is especially challenging, because.. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476560836543012864))<br />
...of the BoE gear available at level 80 that can massively inflate ilvl. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/476561097487446016))<br />
<br />
Anything to report on combat logs being able to see all phases? I don't want to have to implement log merging! <br />
Still working on it unfortunately. Had it functional, but it made phased players show as in range on unit frames, which is bad (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476806905927462912))<br />
can't you add an invisible debuff that separate phases? (a diferent one for each phase) so the client behaves prop<br />
We can do a lot of things. Not saying it's unsolvable, just that we don't have a 100% working version yet. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/476820151883411456))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
What else besides hks, caps, and node defending calculates honor gain in a bg? Is damage/healing output a factor?<br />
Damage/healing isn't. The BG score is though. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/476530605195132928))<br />
<br />
UI / Addons<br />
Also Char specific macro slots? :3<br />
Character specific wasn't feasible unfortunately but you'll have over 100 account slots (up from 36 now). (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/476545304893091840))<br />
FINALLY, what about bnet friendlist?<br />
it's very high on the list and not as trivial as some might think (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/476545533851353089))<br />

Computers - Setup of the Month<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, we will post a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/ssdgraph.gif) are stable, with all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte when on sale. <br />
<br />
The new Haswell Refresh CPUs (http://www.anandtech.com/show/7003/the-haswell-review-intel-core-i74770k-i54560k-tested/1) are here this week, and just like their predecessors they run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002VKVZ1A?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002VKVZ1A). Release is Wednesday (6/25) in the US and they appear to run slightly cooler with a slightly higher max overclock.<br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 4790K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />

These may offer somewhat better overclocking performance, which may worth waiting for if you are overclocking to the limits of air cooling.<br />
<br />
The new Haswell Refresh CPUs are here this week, and just like their predecessors they run a little bit on the warmer side. Depending on how much you want to overclock, you may need to spend a bit more for a better CPU cooler like the NH-D14. Release is Wednesday (6/25) in the US and they appear to run slightly cooler with a slightly higher max overclock.<br />
<br />
Chaud, one is telling us the K CPUs will be out in a few months, the other says this week. Which is it mate. ;)</div></div><hr />

From a company like Blizzard, I would expect to have a normalised structure, i.e. many to many connections. Sharding should be taken care of by the DB software, as far as I know, Blizzard uses Oracle, which scales really well horizontally, better than any other RDBMS. Another place where an issue might be is the service that communicates between clients. Any software developer worth their salt would never design a system that has exactly n amount of friend list slots available. It would have to be a soft limitation (i.e. const int maxfriends = 500, in which case just increase that constant on server and redeploy). <br />
<br />

Just checked your preferred retailer and see what date. For the Unicorn I would actually spend the extra $100 to get the extra 500GHz base clock speed over the i5 version (i7 4790K). With the ASUS board that you linked (the Z97-A), you can use not only over clocking but also the new app software to have it 'tweak' WoW for you. Since WoW doesn't use all cores, and this app can adjust to that, you can really overclock 1-2 cores even more so than if you tried to do all 4 cores. You should be able to run the new i7 ~ 4.7 - 4.8 GHz on 2 cores (so WoW vid and 1 for sound).</div></div><hr />

Is the model viewer available for the monk set? I'd like to laugh at it on a femPanda. It's not on listed on the old news announcement. How would I check? WoWDB doesn't appear to have PTR stuff accessible in a way I can ascertain.<br />

Thanks in advance for any help.</div></div><hr />

From a company like Blizzard, I would expect to have a normalised structure, i.e. many to many connections. Sharding should be taken care of by the DB software, as far as I know, Blizzard uses Oracle, which scales really well horizontally, better than any other RDBMS. Another place where an issue might be is the service that communicates between clients. Any software developer worth their salt would never design a system that has exactly n amount of friend list slots available. It would have to be a soft limitation (i.e. const int maxfriends = 500, in which case just increase that constant on server and redeploy). <br />
<br />
First rule of software criticism: never assume you know anything about the underlying system and hardware. Because you don't. If the setup was as simple to modify as you'd like it to be, don't you think they would have gotten Joe Intern to ctrl+f that constant and make the change? I can guarantee that Battle.net is a bigger and more complex system than probably anyone here has worked on, and if the change isn't trivial it's not trivial for a damn good reason.<br />

Don't hold your breath. You won't get one. Nor do you really deserve one.<br />

<br />

<br />
It's easy to criticize when you're nowhere near the front lines, have no clue how the battle is going, and have never fought one like it before. WoW is an iterative, patch-released software product deployed into an ongoing paid environment with millions of customers. That means that core rewrites are far and few in between because of how potentially dangerous they are. That means that, dollars to donuts, a great amount of the Battle.net integration code (which was written long after WoW was released) is probably aging, and was definitely built for a different world than the one we currently reside in. It can't be judged in hindsight like you're doing now. Hindsight is not an option in enterprise software.<br />
<br />
Long rant short, it's their software stack and was built they way it needed to be. If you think you can do better, click here (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/directory.html#region=Global) and get to work.</div></div><hr />

OneTripleZero is making good point - we don't know how complex BN is and WoW in that matter. Fixing/changing something might require much more work then we can imagine.</div></div><hr />

Hey, you never know, he could have simultaneously been working from home on a second screen. How do you know he's not made more in those 173 days than most people do in a lifetime!!!<br />

Okay sarcasm off, but I really do wonder if he was doing something else simultaneously, cause its not like it takes to much attention to gather herbs...</div></div><hr />
