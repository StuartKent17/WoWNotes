Warlock – Faceless Shroud<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/september/t13_warlock_small.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/september/t13_warlock.jpg)<br />
<br />
A set with the flavor of the Old Gods about it - General Vezax from the Ulduar raid was a reference point. Any warlock tier is a great opportunity to bring a dark and warped aesthetic to player gear and this set was especially ripe for the treatment.<br />
<br />
Replacing the caster’s face with writhing tentacles was the ‘hook’ I started the concept with and built out from there. We always try to include numerous points of illumination into a tier set as it helps to tie the various armour pieces together – whether that be glowing gemstones, fiery runes or, as in this case, bulging otherworldly eyes!<br />

Hope we can get a view of the set on a human or another race that doesn't have a negative waist size.</div></div><hr />

T1 is still one of my favourite sets. At least on my male orc warlock. As for the T13, the whole thing looks pretty boring, except for the helm, which I would probably turn off, since it looks damn ugly.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">dacoolist</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 04:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think undead or orcs are the best looking warlocks out there so, they chose correct, the last was a warrior male, I am a tauren male, but I thought they made the correct choice because a human warrior is imo, the default warrior, just as undead and orcs are for for locks. On the note about the set, it looks good! Best so far in Cata imo, but the best out of all the sets has to be T5, closely followed by T8 (man thats sex).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Deployed</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 04:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definately one of those &quot;see it in action&quot; sets, however, not keen on some of the static aspects of the set. Defaintely has an evil vibe to it, but the tenticles on the robes could be set to a more creative pattern (although it means unique texture per race to do that to avoid distortion), rather than the bland 'straight down' pattern, and the hood part of the headpiece..., I hope the mask and the shoulder animations make up for it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Overlockz</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 04:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Female undead not a great choice imo. I seriously hope this means an old god fight or something, we need Ulduar level raid again (All raids should be ulduar level). I wish they would go back to activation HM's too (Sadly won't happen I'm sure). Otherwise tier looks nice, now just make some stellar shaman tier for my elemental and I'll be happy.</div></div><hr />

...But I hate the colours. Too many different colours... (I counted 7)...some are really pastel...others are really dark and dull. It just creates an ugliness to it...it doesn't harmonize as a design.<br />

<br />
Basically my thoughts exactly. The design is so sweet, but sometimes just picking a dominant color scheme can do wonders. (See, Tiers 4 &amp; 5). Hopefully when the 4.3 boss models come out (N'Zoth?) it'll make more sense, and the colors will remind us of the boss. I'm hoping so, because I like the concept!</div></div><hr />

To be fair its pretty much impossible to me to make a better warrior tier set than tier 6.<br />
<br />
In case of warlocks tier 5 and 6 are my favourites.<br />

But yes, Blizzard's artists did a pretty good job to me with these two tier sets. This time they got it right, finally.</div></div><hr />

Its true, the pallettte chosen was not the best, maybe blizzard in a future makes a dye system posiblle and this would be one of the best warlock sets ever. The design is just awsome, the colours diminish the set a bit.</div></div><hr />

I agree. 8 and 8.5 may be the best of these. The new one isn't bad, but the color scheme feels like it belongs in an 80's new wave video.<br />

If they change the tentacles to be more purple than pink, and adjust the face tentacle to not look so much like lips, I would like it a lot better. The heroic versions always have better coloring, so I'm looking forward to seeing that down the road.</div></div><hr />

I like the inspiration here but the color pallet feels all over the place to me and the shoulders, at least in this preview, feel really simple compared with previous Tiers. Helm is ok I guess though I've been hiding my Helm since after T8 so I guess thats irrelevant. If they adjusted the color pallet I think it could be a fairly strong Tier in the same company as T4, T10 and T12 but falls short of T5, T6, and T8. That's of course provided there's some kind of effect to make up for the simple shoulders.</div></div><hr />

Why would I wear tentacles of an old god as a Warlock? Why would I want to run around in a Deathwing costume? Is 4.3 going to be called &quot;Cosplay Party&quot;? Maybe they expand on transmogrification so that you can tailor your own costume. I want to run around like Therazane, the little cuty.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully a recoloring. I'm surprised Blizz didn't give like 3 or 4 different color styles like they usually do. Hopefully the tentacles move or some spawn from helm or shoulders, kinda like tier 6 with the wings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Replacing the caster’s face with writhing tentacles was the ‘hook’ I started the concept with&quot;<br />
<br />
Seems to make that pretty clear in my opinion. I believe the tentacles on the face will in fact be animated.<br />
<br />
Not my favorite lock set of all time (t5), but it is CLEAR that there was a lot of time put into it, and it is a quality piece of work.<br />
I hope all sets are as good looking as Warrior and Warlock have been so far.</div></div><hr />

Original concept and color scheme tier: COLORS ARE BAD MAN THIS SET SUCKS WTF BLIZZ THIS IS RETARED OMG<br />
<br />
I don't think its so much that more so that there are a lot of colors fighting with each other for attention in this set. Generally I would say you want a single color to be the main color base for the set then 2 additional related colors to give the set a varied feel and tied together (not including black). This one in particular feels like it has 3 main colors (tan bones, pinkish/purple tentacles, and Tealish under) but none of them really jive together. These three colors are fighting for visual interest and while it was based on Vezax who sported a similar color pallet I think it needs to be toned down a tad. If they kept all these colors I would be happy with the originality of the set but I think that they need to maybe darken the bone trim and or the pinkish/purple tentacles at least.</div></div><hr />

Imo, it would be much improved just by darkening that ivory color or changing it. Even if it's based off of that boss, it just looks awful on a tiny (in comparison) player model. Too much going on.</div></div><hr />

Nothing can beat the t5 warlock gear though ^^</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sealbinder</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If the tentacles move, this will be awsome. If not, I am not as sure. I did not like T10 when I saw images of it, but once I saw it in game I thought it was great. I will hold my final judgement until I see people running around in this gear. As a side note I will need to run around and collect the T4 and T9 for Transmogrification. I loved those sets.</div></div><hr />

It reminds me a lot of pestilence and disease, mixed with dark magic. Also reminds me of Nurgle from the Warhammer universe :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KCguy</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's not that bad. Most people don't show the helm and as for the chest and the weird point, well everyone wears tabards so it's covered anyways. All most people will see is the shoulders, which look fine to me. Color wise, it's kind of clowny, but I think it's neat. It's different. JMO.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">deathonabun</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 06:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My initial thought is the coloring is too busy. However, I'm reserving final judgement for a full race/gender preview. (Undead preview is practically useless - everything is so distorted.) Worse case scenario, I make good use of the tiers 5, 6, and 8 sets I've collected.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Drifted</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugly. Partly cause it's UD wearing and I despise any armor on UD. Everything looks horrid on UD. Might change the opinion after seeing how it looks on worgen female.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a RP'er so I could care less if it's dark and evil. It looks so crazy and if those tentacles move it'll be so sick.</div></div><hr />

The mask is there (kinda...) but the rest is ugly. I will not be using this look for tier...:mad:</div></div><hr />

It looks a lot like the ToC druid tier set... same colours even.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The_Butcher</div><div class="date">2011-09-09, 06:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Looks gross and cheap. Mostly the Helmet - Pointy tip resembles T10 - Shrouded face resembles rogue T11 but.. with tentacles.<br />
I Have an 85 warlock, and im unimpressed :(<br />
<br />
I will be impressed however, if they make a graphical effect, like T6 had :D</div></div><hr />

Sorry but I honestly think 90% of the people who post here just like to moan at EVERYTHING Blizz do for some sort of e-kudos amongst other angsty teenagers.</div></div><hr />

I like this set. And i don't play a lock. Maybe that's the issue.</div></div><hr />

Still I have to wonder if the DW raid will include an old god encounter as the armor is based on it? :o</div></div><hr />

Overall, interesting concept and I like it. I love the idea of writhing tentacles coming out of the helm -- can't wait to see it in action!</div></div><hr />

Has no one learned by now that still photos of the tier sets are much worse than seeing a video of how it looks in real time? Save your bitching until the videos come around.</div></div><hr />
