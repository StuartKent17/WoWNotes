Warlords Season 2 Ending Soon<br />
After an in intense season of conflict in Arenas and Battlegrounds, the time is coming soon to see who has climbed to the top of the PvP ranks. Prepare to fight your last battles of this season, and remember—there is no substitute for victory!<br />
<br />
Warlords Season 2 will be ending as soon as a few weeks from now. Once the season ends, we'll begin a roughly two-week process to determine end-of-season reward eligibility.<br />
<br />
All players who believe that they may have qualified for Warlords Season 2 awards should note the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
In order to ensure you receive your award(s), please refrain from transferring your character(s) to another realm or faction until after Warlords Season 3 has begun.<br />
Warlords Season 2 titles and mounts will be awarded a couple of weeks after Season 3 begins. <br />
<br />
<br />
Conquest Points will be converted to Honor Points at the end of the season, and any Honor above 4,000 will be converted to in-game currency at a rate of 35 silver per point. A few other things to keep in mind once the season has ended:<br />
<br />
<br />
The Honor cap will remain at 4,000.<br />
Warlords Season 2 items with rating requirements will no longer be available for purchase.<br />
The Season 2 vendors will move over from where they are now and convert to selling last season’s gear for honor. The Season 3 vendors will appear in the newly vacated vendor location.<br />
Rated Battleground and Arena matches will not be available during the break between seasons.<br />
We will confirm the start date of the forthcoming Warlords Season 3 in a post here in the weeks to come. <br />
<br />
<br />
In war, you win or lose, live or die—and the difference is but an eyelash. To the battlefield!<br />
<br />
<br />

Patch 6.2.3 PTR Notes - November 3<br />
Item Upgrades and Valor are back!<br />
<br />
Item upgrades are back! Players will be able to earn and spend Valor to upgrade items from Hellfire Citadel, crafted profession items, items created from Baleful tokens in Tanaan Jungle, and all Draenor dungeon drops. All the items you’ve already earned are eligible for upgrades retroactively.<br />
To upgrade, visit your friendly neighborhood ethereal in Orgrimmar and Stormwind, or Stormshield and Warspear to upgrade your gear by 5 item levels at a time for 250 Valor, up to twice per item, for a total potential boost of 10 item levels.<br />

Faster. Hopefully.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Typically 5-6 months per season. Can go longer if needed but that puts x-pack somewhere in April-May</div></div><hr />

<br />
A minimum season of 16 weeks(I believe thats what the devs said right?) would put 16 weeks at March 22nd. So is that the soonest the prepatch can land if they stick with their 16 week thing? I think a March 22nd prepatch is likely. <br />
<br />
Lets assume best case scenario here.<br />
<br />
Legions best case scenario launch date is April 19th. Worst case I would say is probably June 28th. I think a date in the middle is likely. May 24th confirmed.<br />

<br />
March 8th is the earliest the Prepatch can hit. <br />
I still think it will hit March 22nd.<br />
<br />
Earliest date legion would hit assuming 4 weeks of prepatch is April 2nd. <br />
I think Legion will launch May 17th or May 24th with a March 22nd prepatch. <br />
<br />
I think a 1.5-2 month prepatch is likely this time since they said it will be big. A May 17th release would be at least 22 weeks assuming a late December beta. So maybe April people could be correct, but I still think thats a tad optimistic. A May 17th release would be at most 28 weeks of beta which is nearly 7 months. So if beta launches right after Blizzcon April release is likely and March is even possible. If it launches in December April is possible and May is likely.</div></div><hr />

He said the neighborhood. So June. He was saying it wasn't tied to the release date since they've already changed it once. And yes, the beginning of June is before and the end of June is after. They're aiming for June. It's just anyone with some sense knows they'll fuck up and it will get delayed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;As soon as a few weeks from now&quot; <br />
<br />
21 days (few =3) + 4 (today is the 4th). Then 2 waiting weeks(&quot;roughly&quot;), for the next season to start (and to sort out all the rewards) 25+ 14 = dec 9th ish. The 9th is a Wednesday, so if it happens it will be the 8th or the 15. The 15th seems like a good day since schools will go on break around then, and people will want something to do on their time off. The soonest is early December, the more realistic is mid December.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. They can push for late spring or summer, and just cut a bunch of things like they did with WoD, I'm sure that'll satisfy all these bottom feeders. Or they can make sure they deliver a quality expansion.</div></div><hr />

And again you leave out the most important part. Actually two important parts since you're leaving out context to fit your narrative. They were discussing the release date for the movie and that it is not tied to the expansion release date ie they are not coming out the same day. He explained they've already moved the movie date once already so they're not going to tie into it if it has a chance of being moved again. He then pointed out that the game would come out around the neighborhood of the movie though. So late may to early july. It's a safe bet they're aiming for sometime in June. And as I've said they're notorious for delays, thus fall 2016 is what a lot of people are thinking.</div></div><hr />
