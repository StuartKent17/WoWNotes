Warlords of Draenor - Garrison and Zone Screenshots<br />
Blizzard released a few new Warlords of Draenor screenshots at PAX. These include four garrison screenshots, along with one of Spires of Arak, Frostfire Ridge, and Shadowmoon Valley.<br />

Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews<br />
There were a few developer interviews recently, so today we are taking a look at an interview from ConvertToRaid (http://converttoraid.libsyn.com/138-convert-to-raid-the-celestalon-and-zarhym-interview) with Celestalon and Zarhym.<br />
<br />
Blizzcon<br />
<br />
Blizzcon 2014 is something that everyone would really love to do. If there is more information, it will be be shared at some point in the near future.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alpha and Beta<br />
<br />
The expansion has been in internal alpha for &quot;quite a while&quot;.<br />
The alpha is currently an employee take home alpha. It will remain alpha when friends and family are invited, as well as when a small amount of players are invited. After that some opt-in players will be invited and it will be beta. <br />
The ramp up of invites will be slower than Mists of Pandaria beta, as there is the new filesystem to test.<br />
The Warlords of Draenor beta will also have a more limited number of people invited compared to the Mists of Pandaria beta. There is no Annual Pass this time, so Blizzard isn't obligated to invite more than a million players as fast as possible again.<br />
The alpha announcement (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/305413-warlords-of-draenor-alpha-testing-begins/) was made because the build had to be uploaded publicly to let employees play from home, which would allow datamining. The notes and announcement helped to provide context for some of the reported changes.<br />
The alpha patch notes were delayed in order to not step on D3 and Hearthstone's news. The alpha builds being produced were also somewhat unstable. <br />
<br />
<br />
Blog Posts and Patch Notes<br />
<br />
There will be a blog post on Professions at some point.<br />
Garrisons will have four blog posts, starting with an overview sometime in the next few weeks. Other blogs will talk about how you interact with your garrison as you level and at level 100. <br />
There is more information coming, as the notes that went up originally were slightly dated, and significantly more information has been added to the notes since then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
<br />
Garrisons have come a long way since Blizzcon!<br />
Garrisons will be part of the leveling experience.<br />
NPCs in your garrison will actually notice you and walk around you, as to not bump into you when they are walking down the road to work.<br />
NPCs in your garrison will also wave to each other and dance with you if you start dancing with them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
Velen (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/april/spacegoatVelen.jpg) is not the new male character model for the Draenei, as he is older and more distinguished than the average Draenei. <br />
WoW already feels very responsive, but the team is working on a way for it to be even more responsive. This means things like heals will take effect faster, or if you cast a shield it will have less of a delay. <br />
Scenarios and Challenge Modes worked out well, so there won't be major changes to them, just small refinements. <br />
There are no plans to do anything with guild levels or rewards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Vengeance<br />
<br />
Vengeance in Mists of Pandaria worked out well as far as the defensive value goes, but the offensive value of it was problematic. <br />
The defensive component of Vengeance is staying and is now called Resolve (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/158298-resolve). <br />
Tank damage varied significantly based on the situation and the mechanic encouraged tanks to take more damage so that they could do more damage. <br />
Encouraging tanks to take extra damage made healers upset and tanks being able to beat DPS on many fights because of the damage they took made DPS upset. When tanks weren't taking a lot of damage, it made the tanks very low on the meters and upset them. <br />
Everyone was upset at the offensive component of Vengeance at some point!<br />
Tank damage will be balanced just like DPS is now, rather than having it vary based on the amount of damage they are taking. The new bonus armor may give tanks offensive power as well.<br />
Tank swapping at X stacks was not a great thing to see on so many fights, so in Warlords of Draenor both tanks will be actively tanking much more often.<br />
The Saber Lash mechanic from previous expansions was fairly boring, as one tank could just stand there and do nothing for most of the fight. However, in current encounters, the other tank would actually have to use their active mitigation skills to survive, making it a viable mechanic again. <br />
<br />
<br />
Healing<br />
<br />
Healer's mana regeneration abilities are being nerfed and removed because they didn't add any gameplay value. For example, Innervate was just a button to press when it was off of cooldown. Base mana regeneration and mana costs were rebalanced to compensate. <br />
Active mana regeneration mechanics are still being considered. <br />
All of the challenging to heal parts of fights in Mists of Pandaria were handled by having the DPS use defensive cooldowns. Healing should be the healer's job, so the team wants to tone down the amount of stackable raid utility that DPS and tanks bring so that the healers are there to handle the challenging to heal moments. <br />
Having a DPS using Healing Tide or Tranquility to heal the raid to full doesn't feel good for the healers.<br />
A raid shouldn't feel like they need to bring a Warlock for Healthstones, which is why Healing Potions and Healthstones will share a cooldown and only be usable once per fight. DPS potions are not on the same cooldown as Healing Potions. <br />
Caring about the efficiency of a spell or minimizing overhealing can be done without making healers run out of mana all of the time. For example, baseline mana regeneration is being significantly increased so that you have decent heals you can cast with just that base regen. <br />
Mana regen will scale less over the course of the expansion than it did before, but the gain will be worth more as you will have more expensive and powerful heals to cast. <br />
For example, Paladins will start the expansion being able to cast Holy Light as their slow and efficient big heal, similar to Divine Light now, and filling with a few Flash of Lights. By the end of the expansion, they will be able to cast a lot more Flash of Lights and fill with Holy Lights. <br />
The point isn't to make healing harder, just less one dimensional. <br />
If you can currently heal Flex raids fine, you should be able to continue to do so with the same level of success in Warlords of Draenor. <br />
Thok would never exist in his current form with the new healing model. <br />
Someone dying to a huge spike of damage before you can even react is not fun and these changes should help to avoid that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
Perks (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight/perks) are intended to make leveling feel rewarding again. They are a mixture of static power increases and tweaks to your rotation that you earn in a random order as you level from 90 to 100.<br />
Readiness won't affect all abilities and the current build's tooltips aren't updated yet.<br />
Secondary stats will be closer in value to each other than they have been in the past.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
<br />
Army of the Dead might come back for all specs as an instant cast rather than a channel. <br />
Blood Death Knights will get some more active mitigation tools. Rune Tap as a big absorb and Rune Strike's small shields are two examples.<br />
Dual Wield is going to remain Frost Death Knights only, as it doesn't fit the Unholy theme.<br />
Frost might see Cinderglacier being the more attractive Runeforge in the future.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s))<br />
<br />
Symbiosis was a cool spell, but it was hard to understand and added a ton of button bloat.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
<br />
Hunters have different specs that don't feel very different. Their rotation was very similar between the specs, so some abilities are being removed from each spec to help with differentiation. <br />
Marksmanship is going put more emphasis on higher damage cast time spells.<br />
Survival is going to put more emphasis on DoTs, multidotting, and traps.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/mage) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#g))<br />
<br />
Prismatic Crystal (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/152087-prismatic-crystal) will hopefully be targeted automatically when summoned. When you attack it, damage you do to it is replicated to nearby enemies, but stronger. <br />
Fire mages didn't scale well, so the team tried to solve that with Inferno Blast. That ended up not being enough, so the Enhanced Fireball (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/157642-enhanced-fireball) perk was added to help when you have a lower level of crit. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/imonks.gif Monk (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/341-Monk) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/monk) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#o))<br />
<br />
Mistweaver Monks needed some significant changes that couldn't be done mid expansion, so the changes were delayed until Warlords of Draenor. <br />
Spirit isn't valuable to Mistweavers right now, as the majority of their healing is cheap. <br />
Fistweaving is intended to be a split between damage and healing. It is intended for when you don't need all of your healing throughput and could use some extra damage.<br />
Renewing Mist and Expel Harm will give you a nice baseline Chi generation. <br />
Surging Mist and Spinning Crane Kick will give you more Chi generation as you get more Spirit. Surging Mist will be improved in Warlords of Draenor, it won't be as bad as it is now.<br />
Rushing Jade Wind (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/116847-rushing-jade-wind) won't work with the Empowered Spinning Crane Kick (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/157415-empowered-spinning-crane-kick) perk.<br />
Touch of Death (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/115080-touch-of-death) doesn't work well in raiding, which is why they made it easier to use.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/273-Paladin) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/paladin) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#I))<br />
<br />
Retribution is in a good place design wise, but their numbers are a little low. This will be addressed in a later tuning pass.<br />
Shining Protector (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/159374-shining-protector) will give Protection Paladins extra healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/274-Priest) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/priest) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#U))<br />
<br />
Shadow Priests won't need completely different sets of gear for single target and AoE fights. They could swap out a few slots of gear to use for a single target fight though.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Q))<br />
<br />
Rogue specs are somewhat similar now, but not as bad as Hunters. <br />
The team is removing some skills from each spec to make them more distinct. <br />
Positional requirements were relaxed somewhat as a quality of life change. You still have a 3% chance to be parried from the front, so you still want to stand behind the boss.<br />
Leeching Poison isn't planned to be a lethal poison. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/shaman) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#c))<br />
<br />
Mana Regeneration is being significantly increased to compensate for the removal of Healing Wave.<br />
Enhancement Shamans should have some ramp up time for their AoE, but after the ramp up time it will be strong. The Tier 16 4pc bonus worked out well to help with this. Tuning of Enhancement AoE in the past wasn't great, but the team is going to be sure it is done right this time.<br />
Crit will be improved for Elemental Shamans. <br />
Lightning Bolt no longer being castable on the move is a big change, but it was done to make movement reduce the damage that ranged DPS does. There are other spells that you can cast while moving, such as Shocks and Unleash Weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k))<br />
<br />
Warlock Gateways were too strong this expansion, so the range is being reduced and cooldown increased.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/278-Warrior) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warrior) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#E))<br />
<br />
Berserker Rage (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/18499-berserker-rage) doesn't Enrage you anymore, but the team is considering changing that, as well as changes to Berserker Stance.<br />
Arms originally had Overpower removed, but it didn't work out well. <br />

PAX Beta Key Redemption Issue<br />
At PAX East in Boston this weekend we’re handing out Beta keys to those who wait in line and play the Warlords of Draenor demo at the show. As the expansion is still in an internal Alpha, the keys we’re handing out are inactive, with the intention that they are redeemable for a future test phase. However, yesterday we discovered that a small amount of people were actually able to claim their keys and log in to the Alpha.<br />
<br />
We’ve resolved the key claim issue and no further key claims should be possible. Those who were able to claim a key will need to redeem it again once the proper Beta phase begins.<br />
<br />
We’re not looking to take action against accounts or content involved in this unintended access. We know everyone is excited to play Warlords of Draenor, is looking forward to additional information about the expansion, and we hope you’ve enjoyed what you’ve seen thus far—keeping in mind, of course, that we are still at an early testing phase.<br />
<br />

How do you feel about warriors/pallies/bears being able to tank by just macroing in SD or Shield Block/Barrier/of the righteous?<br />
It's probably a little too good to do that, but not much. However, simultaneously, I wouldn't say that the difference between an unskilled tank and a skilled tank is the wrong size. It's big, but that's good. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447567885246795776))<br />
<br />
with haste breakpoints being removed why would aff locks want any haste?<br />
You probably misunderstood what removing haste breakpoints means. It still makes DoTs tick faster and spells cast faster. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447574209514840066))<br />
That confuses me, so we still get extra dot ticks?<br />
Yes, absolutely. It's just smooth, not with breakpoints. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447579897511174145))<br />

wondered why DKs haven't been designed like monks for DW vs 2h<br />
You mean having different rotations/priorities/strengths/weaknesses, but still balanced, like Frost DKs? Just different classes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447905204378140673))<br />
Frost DKs having two different subspecs was an evolutionary thing. Masterfrost was an accident, but cool, so we formalized it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447905698328768512))<br />
He was probably talking abt basing abilities on wpn DPS rather than dmg so 2H/DW are balanced and play identically.<br />
We want 2H vs DW monks to play identically. We *don't* want 2H vs DW Frost DKs to play identically. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447914542643683328))<br />
How can you say that? One of the two will always be inferior. Historically, that is usually 2H Frost.<br />
How inferior and in what situation? There have been many times they've balanced enough that it varies by fight/gear (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/448014430324785152))<br />

Is there a chance seal of faith will make it into the game? Was looking forward to paladin melee healing<br />
Maybe at some later point. It's on our &quot;Shelf of Ideas That Have Potential But Aren't Ready Yet&quot;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447905935701209088))<br />

outside of Divine Insight, is there a way for Shadow Orb generation to scale with haste? Only resource not to, seems off.<br />
Haste already has high value for you, and you get more value per orb with more haste (haste = more DP ticks). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447896884292501504))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
Are you concerned that without enough Readiness to get in an extra CD usage, Readiness Rating is wasted for the most part?<br />
It'll effect more that just 3min CDs, and CDs earlier are always better. There'll be breakpoints, but they'll be really soft. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447897459172192256))<br />
(But to more directly answer, yes, it's a concern, but it's one we think we can mitigate and handle) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447897608896253952))<br />
Are you worried about people gearing around encounter specific breakpoints? For example-major CD for every belt.<br />
It's a concern, sure, like I said. We actually don't mind if you end up in a situation where you keep a few (FEW, not 30)... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447902411357581312))<br />
...pieces of alternate gear around, and swap based on the encounter. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/447902559710105600))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Hey, are there going to be some 1-2 boss raids like in tbc? or did you scrap that concept? (or onyxia etc.)<br />
None is planned for 6.0 - I wouldn't say we've scrapped the concept, though. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/448140818277097472))<br />

Thoughts on Tarren Mill vs Southshore BG?<br />

<br />
Professions<br />
Well, in the interest of crafting having a more prevalent role. Instead of items primarily being on rep or currency vendors.<br />
What would you want the role of rep/currency items to be in that world? (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/448182962836606976))<br />
Perhaps reputation accesses content and narrative, instead of another item faucet?<br />
You'd prefer no item rewards from reputation? (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/448197889655709696))<br />

WoD will have quests that &quot;pop up&quot; when you're around, will these scale up/down like we've seen with Public Quests in other games?<br />
Rare spawns on IoT/TI scale with # of attackers, improving this in WoD so they don't blow up so fast. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/448238195222650880))<br />

I disagree. I see “farm on 11 chars per day” as negative. Most players would agree. Doesn’t make your opinion invalid.<br />
When doing things on an alt is a fun/different experience, it's good repeat gameplay. When it's not, questionable. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/448180443100094465))<br />

For example, Innervate was just a button to press when it was off of cooldown. Base mana regeneration and mana costs were rebalanced to compensate.<br />
<br />
It provided a utility that allowed healers to slack in their mana management or to provide a boost in damage heavy situations... that's kind of the definition of gameplay value...<br />

The point isn't to make healing harder, just less one dimensional.<br />

But reading this healing post annoys the hell out of me. Healing is the healers job but it was a test of a skilled DPS to know how to manage defencive CD's to help big spikes of damage (deterance on Iron Prison or during shockwave on Jug HC)<br />
<br />
I do kinda agree with the healthstone issue but it was a bonus, not a requirement to have a lock for cookies. DPS have recount to track how well they are doing, healers have mana regen to track how well they preform. Bad payers will run oom and QQ, the good palyers will take a step back and adapt</div></div><hr />

<br />
Playing a priest since Classic, I feel like healers are the only ones who really need to work in this game. Tanking became retardedly easy, and DPS never really have to do anything but press buttons in a sequence. Also switched to DPS/Tank Warrior mid Pandaria, and the game became so much less stressful it's not worth mentioning, just do the sequence of button presses, watch big numbers go out, step out of shit and wait for heals to drop on you, even easier when you play a ranged class. <br />
<br />
Whilst I though spam healing in BC and Wrath was stupid, I actually wish I'd have more of that nowdays instead of making stupid calculations of what you can cast and what not in certain situations - as explained above, nobody else has to do that, but healers, and now it seems we get our &quot;oh shit&quot; spells removed, to make healers life even more stressful - spread this love to other roles too, or make healing as dumb and straightforward.</div></div><hr />

Eh? That will never happen, never.<br />
<br />
It's not only WoW's style, it's Blizzard's style, Diablo is a bit more realistic because of the tone of the game, but it's still using a similar palette and hand painted textures and so on.<br />
<br />
A lot fits in each game, compare Diablo's Mystic, Jeweler and Blacksmith stations to the profession buildings for Garrisons for example.<br />
<br />
Theres clearly a huge detail and fidelity upgrade in WoD, even over MoP.<br />
<br />
As for Trees, well, they've never got them right, it's kinda hilarious if you go back to Quel'Danas now and look at the trees, which looked pretty amazing for TBC trees tbh.<br />
<br />
I think the tusks are unfinished though, they clearly look out of place in regards to quality in comparison to the rest of the body, at least on that screenshot, but it may just be from artifacts and compression.</div></div><hr />

Maybe cartoonish wasn't the right word to use. I understand they have their own style, which is ok I guess, and I care for gameplay more. But when I see new character models (and they look nice) in a world that doesn't look in line with those models, it feels out of place. When going to an old instance of zone, will it still feel like being part of the same world? Why the spikey mountains, which mountain has spikes like that?<br />
<br />
I find Diablo more &quot;the same game&quot; than WoW at the moment and by the looks of the gameplay screenshots. Just my 2 cents</div></div><hr />

I wish spires of Arak had forest green sky (like that in Skettis/Terokkar - one of my favorite skies/ambiences) or something reddish. Maybe its me just being nostalgic. At the end of the day, Will have to experience it on live to see how it feels. It feels very bright at the moment. Maybe it has something to do with a) a theme of being high in the mountains and therefore somewhat sunny or b) a bright theme to match the whole Arakkoa sun god worship.</div></div><hr />

Enhancement AOE addressed a bit more and will be excited to see what they do . Also really like the changes being made to hunter specs to make them feel different.

I too have been healing on a holy priest since vanilla, and getting fed up of relearning how to heal each expansion. As to healers needing to work in the game....and this is old school...when I took my first rDPS alt into MC, I realized the healers and tanks were the only ones playing 100% of the time...as a rDPS I could put myself at the back of the 40 man pack and go AFK for a minute mid fight and nobody noticed (yeah no dps meters running).

It's an art-style adapted from the Warcraft 3 series since this is World of Warcraft. The character models do look in line with the new zones. Definitely. Have you not seen any screenshots? they look HD but still keep that 'cartoony' feel that WoW has always had.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why the spikey mountains, which mountain has spikes like that?<br />
To you, and anyone else complaining about the spikey mountains, let me just refer to their vision of the zone:<br />
<br />
http://news.nateimg.co.kr/orgImg/hk/2013/11/09/201311096246v_CA.8024338.1.jpg<br />
<br />
&quot;For travelers limited to two legs, Arak is an autumnal, swampy forest, framed in crooked trees that rest chin-level with giants. High above the trees towers a landscape rarely seen by outsiders: impossibly tall rock spires too steep to scale. The Arakkoa gaze out from these treacherous perches, watching their land like incarnate gods . . . and paying homage to the blessed sun by burning the “low races” alive.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's Alpha so of course it'll be touched up. I imagine they'll refer back to their concept art, but it's supposed to have high peaks that stretch to the sky. It's called Spires of Arakk for pete's sake. Not Hills of Arakk, lol.<br />
<br />
Anyways, i love they detail they are putting into Garrisons. it shows that they are improving their AI and they could definitely apply the level of detail for NPCs in Garrisons to other places such as Stormwind &amp; Orgrimmar. Or more importantly, Karabor and Bladespire Keep (The two main citiy hubs for H &amp; A this expansion).<br />

<br />
A button doesn't allow you to slack when fights are designed around having the button. Fights in Cata and MoP were designed with the fact you have innervate in mind. What let you slack was playing below your skill level or overgearing for spirit.<br />
<br />
Giving a boost in heavy damage situations is called a healing cooldown. You don't need a mana cooldown for that unless mana regen is balanced around you having one. You're just copying a single function (dealing with heavy damage) to two different buttons (burst healing and burst mana regen). That's not more gameplay, that's just bloat.<br />
<br />
<br />
By removing everything that gives it dimensions? 0o Yay no mana management, yay no choosing the best spells for the situation, yay no more utility spells, yay removing all unique class spells &lt;3<br />
<br />
Yay you didn't read anything else regarding their goals for healer design in WoD. Yay you're stating the exact opposite of everything they've said aside from this one line you've chosen to take out of context.<br />

it is happening to most of range classes - why should spriest be the one punished with no cast on move - this is bringing range back into place they belong - u decide to bring more range to your raid to make mechanics easier then u suffer dps loss - its a very good move from perspective of melee dps who were outcasts in raid scene for last couple of tiers.</div></div><hr />

No, you're right. MoP was 5 months from announcement to beta, then 5 months to pre-expansion patch, then another month to launch.<br />
<br />
By that schedule, WoD should have been in beta about a week ago. It's not significantly behind (yet).</div></div><hr />

So elemental shaman who are close to the bottom when it comes to dps done are going to get nerfed yet again. What about the amount of dps Frost mages do with their instant cast Ice Lance?

They're only gimped because of how they're balanced. If Lava Burst did 500% more damage you'd be OP, right? Just because some weight is taken off one side doesn't mean it can't be replaced with something else, or that it won't also be taken off the other side too. That's how balance works. It's not as easy when your scale has 34 arms.<br />

Playing a priest since Classic, I feel like healers are the only ones who really need to work in this game. Tanking became retardedly easy, and DPS never really have to do anything but press buttons in a sequence. Also switched to DPS/Tank Warrior mid Pandaria, and the game became so much less stressful it's not worth mentioning, just do the sequence of button presses, watch big numbers go out, step out of shit and wait for heals to drop on you, even easier when you play a ranged class. <br />
<br />
Whilst I though spam healing in BC and Wrath was stupid, I actually wish I'd have more of that nowdays instead of making stupid calculations of what you can cast and what not in certain situations - as explained above, nobody else has to do that, but healers, and now it seems we get our &quot;oh shit&quot; spells removed, to make healers life even more stressful - spread this love to other roles too, or make healing as dumb and straightforward.<br />

Noticed that too, huh? &quot;Welcome to the expansion! You no longer know how to heal&quot;. I'd say I'm glad I play DPS now, except I play a hunter and the just removed a ton of my abilities. <br />

i really feel bad for ret paladins since they are in a bad spot when it comes to dmg done right now &gt;.&lt; What makes this worse is the fact that u insulted my spec ele shaman. ;) Its interesting how most ppl seem to know which class is good/bad (like we all know how op the locks are) but at the same time we get the same responses `x class is ok we are happy with where he is right now (on the bottom and it should stay there)` lets get some equal ground here lets put retri paladins on top followed by ele shamans and the rest of the weak dps classes and for one expansion have mages and locks be on the bottom!<br />

There was a blue post already telling how they are not only reducing healing but also increasing survivability, so the health pool will be bigger relative to<br />
damage taken. We probably won't see as many 90% hits, hopefuly healing will become a more steady road one that takes strategic thinking, knowledge <br />
and skill to stand out but won't necessarily punish newbies and slackers. You're right about healing being the more challenging spec but having to put extra effort makes for a more interesting gameplay - at least in my book.</div></div><hr />

Oh crap... Please, please, please tell me that this is sort of thing you get introduced to, and then never have to deal with ever again if that is your inclination (like pet battles or farming). Out of everything I never wanted to do in this game, Garrisons is the absolute top of that list.<br />

Retribution is in a good place design wise, but their numbers are a little low. This will be addressed in a later tuning pass.<br />

As of right now in MoP? Yeah. A tad on the simple side, but at least they have a niche. With some of the pruning though, I am really not sure. Unless they have more changes in mind (which is certainly possible), I could probably set up two of those wobbling bird things (a la Simpsons) to handle the entire Ret rotation.<br />

I just don't get *why*! It was a fun perk of being Ele. Considering that LB is hardly a massive source of damage, it just gave the Shaman a little something to do on high movement fights. It was a fun class perk. Pulling it and forcing Ele to play as an immobile turret just isn't fun. I don't understand why this change exists. Ele already struggles a bit with identity, stripping away a fun perk like this just hurts.</div></div><hr />

There is always a blue post how things will change, for the better or worse, let's not mention that they said before Cataclysm and even before Pandaria that there wont be spike damage, yet it's still in the game, actually more as ever. This doesn't bother me however, what bothers me is that healers play a completely different game to other roles, and as said with each and every expansion healers are the only ones who have to re-learn how to play the game. There are spells being removed or modified from all classes and roles and new stuff added, but essentially they are doing the same thing, not so with healers. <br />
<br />
After playing a healer for 8 and half years, I don't care about how rewarding it is to keep your raid up and be the saviour, it becomes boring to watch bars dance up and down and that's the only thing you will see 80% of the time in a raid - that's why I decided to switch to DPS even tho I'd rather heal, but as DPS as said I can play laid back, press the skills in a sequence that mathematically equals bigger numbers, not have to worry about resources and get stuff done. <br />
<br />
If you ask me, TBC was the best healing experience I had followed by Wrath and then it went south. You had your big damage you needed to be wary of, and then you had spam fights where you could as a healer relax a bit and just spam your CoH or PoM and get shit done, I don't know why this was so bad - boring, sometimes yes, but it way more boring to be on your toes the whole time a new raid comes out and and being OOM 90% of the time, before you get adequate gear.</div></div><hr />

If it is integrated with questing, what is the big deal. You realize you did a lot of the same thing while leveling in MoP. For horde, in Jade forest, we took over an alliance airstrip, then in Kun-Lai, we liberated a village and turned it into a fort for the horde. In Dread wastes, we teamed up with the Klaxxi and then went and freed NPC so that they could come back and be quest-givers in the quest hub<br />

Perks are intended to make leveling feel rewarding again.<br />
They are a mixture of static power increases and tweaks to your rotation that you earn in a random order as you level from 90 to 100.<br />
<br />
Of course we won't be fixing 90% of levelling experience. Just buy that boost already, holinka has a rancho mortgage to take care of.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Army of the Dead might come back for all specs as an instant cast rather than a channel.<br />
<br />
Well in fact we don't really expect THAT many unsubs, so you can just as well forget it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Symbiosis was a cool spell, but it was hard to understand and added a ton of button bloat.<br />
<br />
Finding a balance for various specs is so beyond us we thought Rejuvenate for a lock with a tanking pet, Plague Mushroom for a frost DK who doesn't want to waste runes on an AoE opener and Dash for those pesky hunters were as good as we could ever go. We can't do any better so it's getting scrapped.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunters have different specs that don't feel very different.<br />
<br />
Now they will feel as similar as they ever were, just additionally gutted for you convenience. Oh, you haven't preordered WoD to boost a lock? You might not exacty enjoy the later announcements then.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Retribution is in a good place design wise<br />
<br />
Oh, you missed the last time we denied fscking rets up beyond recognition. How many repetitions do you need to finally acknowledge the simple fact we know better how to play the class you played for 8 years?<br />
Also, you can always buy a fresh 90 fury warrior. Buy. Buy. BUY. We don't give a flying fsck about your issues but we sure love your monies.<br />

Warlock Gateways were too strong this expansion, so the range is being reduced and cooldown increased.<br />
<br />
People much better than us made something really awesome and loved by everyone. We will never be 5% as good as them, so either we will break what they made or exit openings of our digestive tracks will explode like so many supernovas.<br />

And of course there is the option of using it on someone else, and a huge amount of strategy related to how to use it in PvP. That's all gone now. It's definitely a dumb-down of the game.<br />

Of course having played through all the content in Warlords you speak from experience. Not saying you're 100% incorrect but you need to take everything into consideration before jumping to conclusions.</div></div><hr />
