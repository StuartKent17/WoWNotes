So I assume the moonkin switches between looks depending on faction? Or will it be like the worg pup which changes on spawn, do you think?</div></div><hr />

People pay for lots of totally unnecessary bullshit in real life, because they have (what is perceived by them as) disposable income. This is another one of those things. Call it a status symbol, call it a waste of money, call it whatever you want, but this happens every day in and out of WoW.<br />

Have you actually read what's being written? 50% of the hatchling and the hatchling ONLY.<br />
<br />
You're one of the kind of people that would answer the question of &quot;why did you buy that retarded horse?&quot; with a &quot;half the money goes to charity!&quot;. As so many believed because their eyes are in the middle of a freaking black hole called ass.<br />
<br />
On topic. Nice looking pets, but as last time, using charity to boost sales is lame. <br />

Yes, because &quot;both&quot; can't stand for &quot;both moonkin pets&quot;. Have you actually commented without thinking? You're just as stupid as &quot;the kind of people&quot; you criticize in your comment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is it &quot;lame&quot; to use charity to boost sales? If you're someone who likes to give to charities like myself, this is like getting a pet for half price since I want the other half to go to charity regardless. I'll definitely be getting the hatchling, and maybe rag too cause he is just badass.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure there is only one moonkin pet which changes depending on faction, hence the alliance moonkin with the alliance toon, and the horde moonkin with the horde toon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It always amuses me. :-) Value is down to the individual. If you get some satisfaction from the pet why not treat yourself. If you feel that your values dictate that buying pets ingame is wrong / a waste so be it.<br />
<br />
Each to his own.<br />
<br />
Ps: owh and btw jealousy is an ugly yes oh so ugly frame of mind. :]<br />
Pps: stating that the reason for buying is the good cause and solely that is also...well....need i say it.</div></div><hr />

Re read the post I quoted and come back. If you are able to take the &quot;both&quot; from that sentence into a different context than mine, then you are awesome. <br />

<br />
What that has to do with anything? <br />
<br />
Nothing. Or maybe something? None of your business really. <br />

Giving money to charities should come from you (pity in most cases), and should not be boosted by a 'reward' for doing so in the process.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's a marketing trick, it works as easy as:<br />
Don't do it, earn 1 million.<br />
Do it, get 3 million in, give 50% to charity for a mention in the media for how nice we are, and earn 1.5 million.<br />
Imaginary values of course, but that's how it works, and believe me, it does. The idea of spending money on something you want and getting the idea you really help someone out is a thing many companies like to play with for more income. Ignoring the fact that's its tricking people into morally not so 'all right' acts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Conspiracy theories? Before the Activision shit, sure. Now? Hell no. <br />
<br />
If you really are someone who wants that pet, go to the Make A Wish Foundation website or any other. And donate 5 bucks and get the mount after the charity act is over. <br />
Yes you wasted 5 more bucks, yes you gave blizzard 5 more too. But it's how I'd do it if I really wanted a pet. I know the irony of this yet I'd still be walking with a better feeling than falling for such shameful marketing techniques.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how that's a trick. People don't buy them solely because they want to be charitable, they also want the pets as part of it. If they just released the pets without any charity thing, they'd still sell and Blizzard/Activition would still get money. I don't believe people are stupid enough to think this is a totally charitable act but I hope they see the value of doing it. <br />
<br />
If buying a pet raises X Million for charity, well done Blizzard. You made the world a better place.</div></div><hr />

They wouldn't sell as many as they will with the charity. The money raised for charity should come from a person because he wants to donate, not because they get something in return. <br />

If Blizzard wants to be such a noble company, give a few million to a charity without requiring their players to boost their income first.</div></div><hr />

Don't assume people don't donate simply because they refuse to raise the company's income even more. You make it sound like there's no other way to donate to a charity except through means of a business marketing trick.</div></div><hr />

Why is EVERYONE making such a big deal out of the money aspect? &quot;OMG IT COSTS like 10 BUCKS!

Seriously, if ANY of you shop for cupcakes, or goldfish or any worthless snack food that doesn't benefit you at all and gets devoured in a few days, (which should be all of you) then you should know that these pets are a much better deal. They don't taste good, but they at least look good! And they don't go away like a bag of potato chips so you wont have to buy another pet every week unlike snack food or soda or beer or whatever.</div></div><hr />

You're not being forced to buy this. It's an optional vanity item that does nothing to enhance character skills/stats. If you don't like it, don't buy it. You will be neither better nor worse off for giving them a pass.<br />
<br />
Half of the money for at least one of the pets is going to charity. Who cares if Blizzard is making a great deal of money on it as well? If Blizzard wasn't making money, they wouldn't be making great games. I hope they make a ton of money on these and use a portion of it to develop more games/expansions. And if they don't? Oh well. Companies are for making money. True story. What's that? They're &quot;tricking&quot; us into buying these under the guise of charity? Nope. It says right there: 50% of the purchase for this pet goes to charity, and indeed 50% will go to charity. Nobody reading that and clicking the BUY button is being tricked. I'm pretty damned sure everyone knows Blizz isn't just doing this out of the kindness of their hearts. I'll say it again: Companies are for making money.<br />
<br />
What do you care if someone else buys it? They had a bit of disposable income and decided to spend it on some small item that'll bring them some measure of happiness. How is that any different than, for example, having a subscription to an online game? Are you upset that someone else would have 10$ to spare on a pure luxury item when you have to save your pennies for a Big Mac? There is no reason to be upset/derisive if someone else chooses to spend their money on these things...unless you yourself covet them and just can't afford them.<br />
<br />

<br />
None of that sort. I just hate the approach on charity here. <br />
Sure, if you really want the pet you would buy it either way, but the people that feel they don't really want to fill stockholders pockets even more are somewhat in a dilemma, it looks cute but it costs 10 bucks. Now, the charity act makes sure those people can make a decision, and that majority brings in more money than the first group. <br />
<br />
<br />
Not really. People pay more for a product if it includes a charitable donation.<br />
<br />
Exactly. And the Philips Mp3 next to it with the same sound quality, same capacity and additional batteries sells 4 times less. Marketing trick succeeded. People feel like Sony is a noble company for donating, while the high placed chairmans laugh while swimming in their 10 million bonuses. ;)<br />

(It also seems like they haven't picked one yet?) They could just sell it and make money. And they would. They would make more than they will giving half to charity. But by doing this, it is a win/win/win. Blizzard wins because they make some money and get some good publicity. The charity wins because Blizzard can raise far more doing this than most other corporations can. (Also having worked for a charity, Blizzard is raising money, not pledging it, which means the charity WILL get the funds.) You win because you get a cute ingame pet for the cost of 2 pints of beer at the pub/ 2 McDonalds meals / part of a month of WoW/ 1/10 of most of our cell phone plans, not to mention the good feeling you get for knowing you have helped, even just a little, a deserving charity. And if you buy it for other people for Christmas, you get a *great* inexpensive, easy to get Christmas present that you don't have to wait in line to buy and you spread that good &quot;I gave to charity&quot; feeling on to others as well.<br />
<br />
Also one should assume that only the Moonkin is going to charity, if the precedent set by the Pandaren and Lil' KT are any indication.<br />
<br />
Regardless, we get to see Capitalism and Democracy at their finest. Vote with your money. Love the idea of it? Buy it. Hate the idea of it? Don't buy it and make sure others don't buy it for you. They will keep making them as long as people keep buying them. Personally I love them. Cuts my Christmas buying by half, and even then I spend half as much on these as I would have to if I went out and bought &quot;real&quot; gifts, not to mention, no clutter, packaging, etc. There is nothing but win here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because you see itas getting a pet from giving money to charity which is what Acti... sorry &quot;Blissard&quot; wants you to belive which is incorrect.<br />
<br />
The purpose with thease &quot;charity pets&quot; is not to give money to charity. Sure it DOES give money to charity and that's a good thing but it's not because it's a good thing that Blizzard does this. You buy the pets with some kind of illusion that you did a good thing and got a pet for it when in fact you gave 5$ to Blizzard and an equal amount to charity. This Blizzard exploits as both a mean to earn money an as a PR stunt.<br />
<br />
You think they would have made the pets if the whole amount wouldgo to charity? The answer is no, not with Activision pulling the strings.<br />
<br />
Though we should not blame it all on Activision, it's not only their greedyness fault but the greedyness of the players. Would you have donated 5$ or 10$ if we count the total if you hadn't gotten a pet for it? You feels like you did something good when buying a pet or 10$ when 5$ went to charity then think like this instead, what if instead of the pet you donated 10$ dircetly to charity? Then you trully did a selfless act of charity but then again the people that play WoW aren't known to be selfless.</div></div><hr />

Again, there is no &quot;trick&quot;. Of course Blizzard is making money on this. I'm sure it's the point. Of course they're giving half of it to charity to ensure that more people buy it. It's a business. Most of the people who buy this are not suffering from the delusion that Activision's Kotick is really just a big softie under his shithead exterior. They are buying it because they just want it. The fact that half of it WILL go to charity is just an added bonus.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is not going to take all of the money and then NOT give half to charity.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is not going to take your 10$/Euros and then NOT give you the pet.<br />
<br />
There is no shell game being played here. People are quite knowingly spending money for a vanity item. Blizzard is making money. A charity is going to get a sizeable donation. There is no real down side. Don't like the idea of Blizzard making money? Don't buy or subscribe to their games.<br />

Activision Blizzard is a for-profit corporation. It is no secret conspiracy that they have some interest in making money, and if you're willing to accept the tenets of capitalism then there is nothing inherently unethical about that goal.<br />
<br />
There are a number of ways to provide additional incentive to purchase products, and a promise to donate some portion of proceeds to charity is one of those ways. There is no trickery, no conspiracy, no evil secrets; Blizzard is profiting and donating money to charity. The mentality that profit is equivalent to wrongdoing is childish.<br />

<br />
The Terms of Service prohibit players from purchasing in-game property with real money from third parties.<br />
<br />
There is no &quot;tricking&quot; people into believing that Blizzard is any more caring than anyone else. People might be dumb enough to believe that, but that's truly not Blizzard's fault.<br />
<br />
If people only want to donate to charity, then you are obviously correct in suggesting that they donate directly to charity. If people want a vanity pet, they're not going to get it from a charity. Perhaps they can buy the pet and donate additional money to other charities. The beauty of free will is that a person can understand all of this and make their own decisions without your implication that they are a mindless drone being &quot;tricked&quot; by the Evil Corporation.<br />

Or is your brain so undeveloped yet to grasp the idea of horde and alliance themed pets?<br />
Personally I'm not clear on whether there are three pets or two with one having two versions. Reading through the other comments I'm not the only one. I read the post you're quoting as meaning &quot;Both moonkin pets&quot;. It's possible that person is wrong (again, it's not clear), but it's hardly worth the level of RAGE you're throwing at it if they are. After all, the only other faction themed pets they're offered have been the gryphon/wyvern ones. You could get both in that case if you wished.

I get the whole &quot;big-head d'aaaaaaaaaaw cute&quot; theme, but it's been executed on a level that's overdone to the point of horrifying on the hatchlings. The eyes alone make them look like alien fish monsters. Worse than Onyxia's deformed hatchling.<br />

It is bullshit pay $10+ for something they already regularly add to the game for free then they ONLY give HALF to a charity. So they come off looking like the good guys while they line their pockets with something that takes them relatively no time to program. Seriously, they make mini-pets almost every patch. I'm sooooo sure they need that 50% for themselves, it's not like they get millions and millions of dollars every month to already make these minuscule tiny essentially do-nothing additions, no wait they do!<br />
<br />
Sorry blizzard, your greedy ways are not gonna fool me just because &quot;Charity&quot; is thrown around while you horde money for yourselves for doing nothing you don't already do, while morons who are amused by simple little bits think they are so good because part of what they wasted their money on went to a charity. <br />
<br />
If you (the reader/buyers of this &quot;charity&quot; farce) cared for charity how about you actually give an entire $10+ to charity and you can feel good about that, rather than being cheated out of money (to give to a billion dollar company) for the fleeting joy of one of 200 or so digital pets that you will ignore in the next year?</div></div><hr />

Were they talking about multiple or single hatchling(s) in the news post? I don't notice the 's' in a few occasions, basic reading comprehension allow an easy and logical assumption that the 2 hatchlings are faction themed. There is nothing unclear here at all, just people who have problems with reading or not reading at all, or just posting straight after they saw 2 hatchling screenshots. <br />

You might actually want to read the ToS.<br />
<br />
All ingame property is specifically stated to be owned by Blizzard so, in essence, they can sell whatever they want for real currency; it's their property. The ToS states that anyone or anything outside of Blizzard has no rights to ingame content and thus cannot sell those assets for real currency.</div></div><hr />

<br />
people only donate to charities they are aware of and are either personally invested in; because they had loose change and a tin was rattled in front of them; or as a side product of another transaction.<br />
I am aware of the charity blizz is championing, but I have no personal investment in it, there is no reason for me to donate money directly to this charity as there are others closer to my heart that would receive any unsolicited donations.<br />
<br />
the charity blizz is championing with this will receive donations they wouldnt have normally received and they will not have had to pay for this.<br />
<br />
How much money do you think blizz would help raise for this one specific charity if instead of the pets they had specific &quot;lets all give some money to charity day&quot;<br />
my guess is not as much as selling a pet. My guess is also that their investors wouldnt be all that happy if it appeared like blizz was turning into a charity organisation itself.</div></div><hr />

Making money drives companies to improve their products, and reduce costs so that products compete with one another, and consumers benefit. In this case, since it is Blizzard’s game world, they control everything in it, and they aren’t facing any competition from other MMOs.<br />
<br />
Imagine if you owned a Honda car and were only allowed to use Honda windshield wipers in your car. Not doing so would violate the EULA, and permanently ban you from your car. Since Honda doesn’t face any competition from other windshield wiper manufacturers, they can charge far more than they could if they actually had to face competition.<br />
<br />
In the above example a competing car company could say that their windshield wipers aren’t overpriced, and the cost of maintaining the car is greatly reduced, which could force Honda to lower their prices. Is Blizzard really facing any sort of competition at all from other companies in the MMO market? No. Blizzard is only able to charge as much as they are because they aren't facing any competition. I don’t agree with these practices, which is why I won’t purchase these pets.</div></div><hr />

because there are no other games out there and most certainly not any games they would sell items for real money that could be used in game, if there was we'd probably call it RMT or something like that.</div></div><hr />

The words you were looking for a fluffy care bear pet collectors. In most cases the more casual of players enjoying the game for the smaller values it offers.<br />
<br />
Actually. By hardcore gamer you can be hardcore at collecting: pets, mounts, alts, professions. or other things, lore, quests(loremaster is as hardcore as it gets IMO) PVP, arena etc. It's really only been in WotLK that people have only associated hardcore with raiding. Not really sure why. Been playing since 2005 so i've actualy watched definitions morph over time. It's quite fascinating.</div></div><hr />

This right here. What is their incentive to ever give us any more extra content for the fees we pay when morons buy these pets just because &quot;charity&quot; is tacked onto their money-grubbing ways? They will give us less and less while we (and idiots for even longer) pay for more and more optional things because they realize that morons will pay for things that they used to get for a monthly fee. As more morons buy into this shit they will divert more and more effort towards these money-grubbing tactics overall possibly (depending on how many people will jump in front of a bus for a company that will care less) killing the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
A lot of people are talking about how they are a company out to make money, and I agree, that’s a good thing. Making money drives companies to improve their products, and reduce costs so that products compete with one another, and consumers benefit. In this case, since it is Blizzard’s game world, they control everything in it, and they aren’t facing any competition from other MMOs.<br />
<br />
Imagine if you owned a Honda car and were only allowed to use Honda windshield wipers in your car. Not doing so would violate the EULA, and permanently ban you from your car. Since Honda doesn’t face any competition from other windshield wiper manufacturers, they can charge far more than they could if they actually had to face competition.<br />
<br />
In the above example a competing car company could say that their windshield wipers aren’t overpriced, and the cost of maintaining the car is greatly reduced, which could force Honda to lower their prices. Is Blizzard really facing any sort of competition at all from other companies in the MMO market? No. Blizzard is only able to charge as much as they are because they aren't facing any competition. I don’t agree with these practices, which is why I won’t purchase these pets.<br />
<br />
This right here as well. They take unfair advantage of their position. They charge extra for things that used to be already provided for a bundle (monthly fees) because they can. They are making more and more money but then they cry, &quot;we can't do everything&quot; and we wind up with an expansion only having 5 levels and Hero classes may well be a one-time-off thing. Yes they gave us a bunch with the whole world being redone BUT with the more and more money they make you think they could make expansions and stuff more exceptional but comparatively it is maybe only slightly better overall while they make substantially more money than they used to</div></div><hr />

This is ultimately the exact reason why I purchased the star-shitting sparklehorse mount: I was so sick of hearing assholes whine about how stupid it is that anyone would ever buy an in-game mount with real money, I deemed the prolonging of their own self-loathing disgust to be worth my $25.</div></div><hr />

Really 50% is fine as it is, we all know that is still going to be a pretty number. Hell maybe I'll get one too, depends on what Lil'Raggy can do. If the moonkin moonfire spams all critters near it though, I may change my mind :D.</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard makes more money off of this than they would selling it without the donation then good on them. At least a charity benefits even if their main motivation is to benefit Activision Blizzard. If you are going to buy the pet and see the donation as a sort of extra &quot;bonus&quot; to the purchase, then good on you. If, however, you are claiming to be only buying this pet because it's a donation to charity and to give yourself a false sense of righteous do-goodery, then either:<br />
<br />
a) Admit you actually belong to the first group - you just want a pet and you're lying to yourself about why you're getting it. <br />
<br />
or <br />
<br />
b) Don't get the pet and instead give money directly to charity. Because you know what's better than 50% of $10 in a charity's eyes*? Yes, you guessed it: $10. <br />
Then go and buy the crappiest vendor pet from a capital city (like a roach from UC or a moth from Exodar) and every time you summon it tell yourself &quot;Yes, this could be a mini-moonkin but I decided to go for pure alturism instead**&quot;.<br />
<br />
*which is possibly less than $5. I don't know about US law, but in many places what they would actually give is &quot;50% of $10-admin fees&quot; or &quot;50% of profit&quot;.<br />
** Also, don't read anything about whether or not pure alturism can actually exist or not - it will only depress you XD</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doing crazy things for pets has always been part of WoW - people will spend hours and hours killing raptors or whelps of variouus creeds, hunting down Macaws, running repeated instances. You know what some other people are doing in the same time? Working. I could farm the sprite darters in Feralis for days and not get a sprite darter pet...or I could farm my office for a couple of extra hours or so, still have time to do things I actually find fun in the game and spend the money to be guarenteed to get all the stuff that Blizz has on their pet store. Now, I don't like pets and overtime makes me come out in a rash - so I wouldn't do either of these things....but let's not pretend that doing the latter is any more crazy than doing the former.<br />

If you buy the moonkin everyone will tip their hat for your donation but if you just so happen to like Rag's model better then you're an outcast like all the sparkling pony owners.</div></div><hr />

This is a win/win situation for EVERYONE involved.<br />
<br />
Make-A-Wish get money.<br />
<br />
Blizzard earns some and gets a tax write-off.<br />
<br />
And pet lovers get a pet.<br />
<br />
Everybody's happy.<br />
<br />
Get over yourself if you think this is money invested in a stupid way. You don't see the people that want to buy pets bashing you for whatever you spend your money (be it a new car, a new tennis racket, new football shoes... all of the above even though the old ones were just fine). If they want to spend money on a pet in WoW so be it it's THEIR money NOT YOURS. The fuck do you care?<br />

I don't understand why they aren't including charity for the Rag pet.<br />
<br />

<br />
It's good business, because a lot of people will end up buying both pets. And more people will buy Rag than would if they were to release them seperately. It's embedded in the human brain. I'll do something for charity (with a side dish for me) and then I'll do something just for me since, you know, I earned it.<br />
<br />
Basic psychology. It's a subconcious thing and it works everytime. All good business is worked around it. Same goes for the specific positioning of items in a supermarket. There's a strategy behind everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the record, I'm not going to buy them because there's a charity donation attached. I would have gotten at least one of them anyway because I enjoy collecting fun pets, and these two look great. I can afford it, and so I will. Regardless of what you are trying to insinuate, this does not reflect in the least on my intelligence. The only thing you can reasonably infer from this is that I have the extra pocket money to spend on it. This is absolutley no different than the rest of you buying ANYTHING for entertainment. Oh, this is only pixels? So is every computer game you've ever bought. You pay 15$ every month for one. Get. Over. It.<br />
<br />
While on the subject, the &quot;I pay 15$ a month and derp derp derp&quot; argument was old and flawed before it even started. Millions of people are paying that. Blizzard DOES add new content to the game on a semi-regular basis without charging you extra. You are one person. If you want the game tailored specifically to how YOU want to play or what YOU want, then unsub and go start a gaming company and make your own. You are not a precious snowflake.<br />
<br />
I'm done arguing about this. The fact of the matter is some people just have to piss all over everything to prove how &quot;awesome&quot; they are. You are the reason most online games have an Ignore function.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nibelheim</div><div class="date">2010-11-10, 07:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Definitely cute enough :) <br />
<br />
<br />
I think the only thing that annoys me about the whole &quot;50% goes to charity thing&quot; is not on Blizzard's end but on certain of the buyers' end. <br />
<br />
It certainly has interesting side effects. The sheer marketing value that the charity tag has attached to it is quite huge, but secondary effect is probably more powerful. A lot of people won't like paying cash for a pet, but if you make them feel as though they're doing a good thing, a lot of them will open their wallets. There's nothing bad about it, it's just people seem to have this need to justify their purchases, as though spending their money is a bad thing.<br />
<br />
Tempted to buy Lil Rag myself, but he's a little on the large side :o Perhaps if they made him a bit smaller :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only subconscious evidence is the heckling you get whenever you purchase anything with real money for a video game that also doesn't contribute to charity. Consider the miniscule overhead on a digital item, they should just release everything with a portion going to charity and they would make more money off sales since they have no cost to recoup on a piece of code.</div></div><hr />

You say, everyone with their own opinion and expressed concern or judgment over others is someone you would ignore? Damn, your world must be all fluffy bunnies and carebears, everybody holding hands and singing songs together. Now that's disgusting. <br />
<br />
It's time to realize that people have different opinions, an open discussion forum is for people to be able to express their opinions, just because you don't like what others have to say about this is not making them paranoid. Actually you seem to have more problems with the fact that people are not so happy about this situation at hand, therefor they are disgusting people and should be put on ignore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nobody is shocked that blizzard is making money as a company. People are shocked that such marketing techniques are used by one of the biggest if not the biggest gaming company to get more profit in.<br />
<br />
Either full 100% of that hatcling goes to charity, or none and find that simply giving a few million every year without any PR promotion is more noble than the current process.</div></div><hr />

Well, they are a company. Simply giving money away without telling anyone rarely made anyone a profit. It seems a bit silly to me to try and find anything noble in these situations or debate over the purity of intentions :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LolToon</div><div class="date">2010-11-10, 08:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So let me get this straight.<br />
<br />
People I don't know, people who never known me, people who sit behind a computer, seem to think it's alright to try and dictate how I spend my money, live my life, play my game?<br />
<br />
Well wouldn't it be boring if everyone in the entire world had their exact same opinion. I mean then we'd have no fast food joints, no soda. No sugary foods. We'd only ever eat organic, there'd be no beef, pork, chicken or fish. We'd all either be snobs or kiss asses to the other guy. No one would ever have friends, true friends, because they would either be as judgemental and as much of an ass as the next person or they would think themselves to good for current company and just try to dictate the others actions.<br />
<br />
Wow, isn't that a wonderful world to live in.<br />
<br />
<br />
So to troll- yes I plan on buying the moonkin hatchy while it gives 5 bucks to charity, because my last 5 bucks for the panda helped generate a fair penny for the last charity. And you know what? It made me feel good that the money I donated helped to add up to that.<br />
<br />
Also, I own sparkle horse. You may roid rage and scream and all that, but until you pay for MY life, until you pay for MY game time, until you are married to ME or have a reason to own me like a slave or servant, you have NO right to act like I'm a Twilight fan because I want to spend my money on pixels rather than pizza and a beer!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Judging and dictating are 2 separate things. And I shall do so as I please. <br />
You strike me as someone who is furious about others being able to judge you and have an opinion, over the internet even.<br />
Also no one ever said everyone should have the same opinion, so why you interpretate it in this way is mind boggling. <br />
<br />
If you are so outrageous, that I allow myself to judge others based on what I think and what their actions are, then you are pathetic. <br />
You can disagree with me, come with arguments, have a different opinion and put it a manner that fits and I shall respect that. However you preferred to go the opposite route and just call out troll. Nice approach.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Duh, a useless bit of pixels that they would have probably made anyways if this PetStore didn't exist? Yay -duh- I'm giving to charity and probably getting less in my game overall for doing it! Yay! duh-&quot; -Probably a generous portrayal of anyone dumb enough to think they are doing a good thing with this &quot;charity&quot; where blizzard greedily siphons off half the profits<br />
<br />
You are paradoxical. <br />
Because there's a pet store and people buy pets, we get less &quot;content&quot; in the game. On the other hand, if there wouldn't be a pet store we would still get the same pets and even more content. <br />
I understand your logic, I really do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly.<br />
<br />
Company A says &quot;Let's give everyone Toy X&quot;<br />
or Company A says &quot;Let's give everyone who pays $5 Toy X&quot;<br />
<br />
The same amount of content exists, some has simply become dependent on out-of-game resources.<br />
<br />
It's the way the industry is headed though (look at DLC), because it works. People don't want to miss out on things which are now suddenly &quot;extras&quot; :)</div></div><hr />

You fail economics forever if you think the moonkin just sprang into existence from nowhere and cost nothing to make, advertise, administrate electronic distribution of and so on.<br />

Or you're someone who doesn't think anyone should be allowed to profit from anything, which means you will end up being too self-righteous to work anywhere and just live off the dole all your life.<br />

Lol, me furious about others having opinions? If this was true I'd lock myself away in a closet.
