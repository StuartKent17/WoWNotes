Algalon Preview by Wraith<br />
Wraith (http://wraith-guild.net/) (EU-Ysondre) defeated all the hard mode encounters (10-Man Ulduar) required to access Algalon, the hard-mode only boss of Ulduar. Below are a few screenshots of the fight, you can also check the Algalon the Observer (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=850) page for a few more details on his skills. <br />
<br />
Thanks again to Wraith (http://wraith-guild.net/) for the screenshots.<br />

<br />
Knowing as little as we do at this point, and having great examples like Sarth3D to base guesses off of, it's JUST as safe to assume it's still incredibly difficult on par at LEAST with 25, if not harder. We don't know. Either way, Wraith deserves as much credit as they can get. GJ guys, eager to see progress and what this fights all about.</div></div><hr />

Wow, how long is this going to take people to bring down. Max you have seven hours per week to try this guy spread out over the entire week. Makes me wonder how long it will take to walk back/rez/rebuff between wipes. I'm starting to agree that this guy will destroy raids/guilds while he feeds off our tears.</div></div><hr />

10 man or not they did all the hard modes in one week without having full or even close to full ulduar gear. That's hardcore in my book.</div></div><hr />

You seem to forget how fucking hard the 10 man hard modes are. Mimiron's harder then the 25 man version, imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I would imagine that they did it in BiS naxx/OS/maly gear, so that would be pretty equivalent to full 10 man ulduar gear like the fight is supposed to be tuned for. Unless we have another 10 man Sarth 3D on our hands.</div></div><hr />

Its nice and clean, just what I like to see. :)<br />
<br />
EDIT: Also, its a tiny detail, but I think they mean Nefarian and not Vaelastraz.<br />
<br />
<br />
Update - Algalon seems to despawn after one hour of fight. This is most likely the same mechanics as Vaelastrasz allowing raids to try it only one hour each day.<br />

Bullshit reply ftw. The guy is right. This is nothing else than retarded Sunwell gates. If you get to him first killing the bosses on hard-mode you should be allowed to raid till you kill him, not some crap timer for other guilds to catch up.

Amazing. Not only have you not faced him, but your QQ is about a mechanic that in every conceivable way makes him more difficult, because you must start fresh every day and get only 3 chances to down him.<br />
<br />
This means you can't 'practice' for 15 straight hours. You must be GREAT, you must be on the fucking BALL every single time you face him, because you have to face him fresh each day.</div></div><hr />

mmmh, thats not the most convincing. <br />
im not writing off the 1h limit as a bad idea overall, but its just a little hoop to jump threw. <br />

but in the end it will keep the fight more exclusive and will cause more QQ from noobs.<br />

It's still not at all similar to the Sunwell gates. Those were barriers, nothing to it. No getting to see the boss behind them, period. The hour time limit just assures that you can't wipe against him until your eyes bleed out, perfecting the fight to twitch-reaction proportions. Every time he resets, a group trying to kill him has to make a pull go flawlessly if they want to beat him.<br />
<br />
Awesome imo, I'll never get to dream of possibly beating him, but this makes me happy nonetheless.<br />
<br />
<br />
And what if this time limit of 1Hour a day was just so that this encounter stay for the &quot;casuals&quot; only. That would not give the advantage of &quot;big&quot; guilds which have 15H straight to get tries on him. And this limit would only be for the 10 man version .....<br />

Did you seriously just imply that the hour time limit is intended to make Algalon casual-friendly? Or did I drink too much vodka?</div></div><hr />

The 25 should be harder right now because it should need Ulduar 25 gear.<br />

Its still a great achievement though, noone else has done it yet, and they have a good headstart on Algalon 10 and probably 25 if they are trying that too next week :)<br />

<br />
Naxx 25-man gear is ilevel 213. Only ilevel 226 items drop off Kel'Thuzad. Other ilevel 226 items come from 25-man Sartharion 2-drakes up, and from 25-man Malygos.<br />
<br />
All items that drop in 10-man Ulduar are ilevel 219. The &quot;hard&quot; modes drop ilevel 226 items, and the 10-man hard mode weapons I believe are ilevel 232. (25-man hard mode weapons are ilevel 239, whereas normal 25-man is 232.)</div></div><hr />

Let me make sure I understand a couple things here:<br />

1) After completing all the &quot;Hard&quot; modes, Algagon appears and only stays for 1 hour?<br />
<br />
2) Does this mean you have 1 shot and if you fail to either get to or down him in that 1 hour, you'll have to repeat the entire &quot;Hard&quot; mode process again next week, just to get him to appear?</div></div><hr />

The thing is this rewards people being on fucking point at the start. You can't fuck around and just wipe it, you can't just practice so much until it's obvious what to do. No, you've got a time limit. <br />

<br />
It has nothing to do with making it artificially hard. Everybody here has been QQing so much, Algalon is already full, and it's made him very fat, so he's only going to be able to fight one hour per day before he has to sit down and take a break.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully he is nearly impossible with this current level of gear. It would be nice to have to wait for an entire patch before he goes down, but I don't think that's going to happen.<br />

<br />
Let me make sure I understand a couple things here:<br />
<br />
1) After completing all the &quot;Hard&quot; modes, Algagon appears and only stays for 1 hour?<br />
<br />
2) Does this mean you have 1 shot and if you fail to either get to or down him in that 1 hour, you'll have to repeat the entire &quot;Hard&quot; mode process again next week, just to get him to appear? <br />
<br />
<br />
1) &gt; You have to complete the Hard Mode for Iron Assembly, Hodir, Thorim, Freya and Mimiron (this one is really hard) to get an item like malygos key.<br />
<br />
2) &gt; Since you keep the key, you can make him spawn as soon as you wish (you just have to kill leviathan &amp; deconstrutor to acces the room)</div></div><hr />

I don't get your point. People aren't asking for unimaginitive ways to cockblock guilds. After Naxx, people who were actually good at this game wanted a challenge, a real hard boss that took perfect execution like Archimonde. And no one is QQ'ing about Algalon not being this, as he most likely is extrememly hard. I think they are more bothered about the fact that when they are at the point where they are fighting Algalon and have all hard modes sorted, 1 hour is all you get. Then it's back to having no content for the rest of the week, just like when we all cleared Naxx, OS and Maly in one night.</div></div><hr />

you are the nub here. this is the worst form of cock block since BWL. that has nothing to do with hard or gaining gamining value . they just want to give the illusion that they made an encounter that will last for a while, its pathetic and alot of guilds quit wow when they did it to BWL<br />
<br />
<br />
so you guys think that trying an encounter 1 hour/week is hard? lol.</div></div><hr />

This game is based off some +10 point shit ass 'achievements' which means jack shit, maybe you get a recoloured mount, or meaningless text added by your character name, and it's summed up by saying: Lich King expansion.<br />
<br />
So, more of this please. Icecrown should contain more Algalon based encounters. And it should be encouraging to see top guilds downing algalon on hardmode, running around with epics which noone else has, gives value to gear - and the main goal for most players is to achieve the best gear possible. Get it?<br />

Just stop bitching. If you want easymode, go play Tetris on level 1.</div></div><hr />

thank you for an intelligent objection :)<br />
<br />
It's kind of more about where you put your perspectives at. But using your logic you can also say that it's VERY likely that the QQ'ers that I mentioned in my post are not the same QQers in this thread.<br />
<br />
What my real point is that people will QQ no matter what Blizz throws at them heck, they could probally make a option of removing the 1H time limit and getting the achievement 'LOL I downed Algalon after raiding him 19 hours a day' or keeping the 1H time limit and getting the achievment '1hour a day 7months...FINALLY!' and the same people who QQ'd that the Tiers made them look like F***in clones of each other would QQ that 'it's not unified' or something like that</div></div><hr />

Imagine preparing for that 1 hour for a long time with detailed planning and preparation only to have the server fail on you. It would be much better if they made it something like a one 3 hour period per week, or maybe even a set number of pulls per week. That would be enough to get a good night's attempts in, but would make it impossible to throw yourself at the encounter for 10 hours a day 4 days straight.</div></div><hr />

The thing is this rewards people being on fucking point at the start. You can't fuck around and just wipe it, you can't just practice so much until it's obvious what to do. No, you've got a time limit. <br />

What is measured in an exam? Your perfomance. You have to provide a particular amount of work in a given time frame.<br />

Let's bring this to the WoW level:<br />

skill = sucess in raids / time spent raiding<br />

What's wrong with that? It's the closest thing to a real skill check you'll ever get in an MMO.<br />

Damn straight it's a challenge. You have to be on the ball from the word go, no wiping 10+ hours until you kill him. If you fail to kill him properly in the allotted time, then you fail for that week. Optional boss is not only optional, but uber hardcore. Gogo Blizz. Just because he has better loot doesn't make it progression, because unless his loot table is fucking MASSIVE, there will not be a slot upgrade for every class from Algalon.</div></div><hr />

2. A boss, optional or not, is progression to me<br />

IT IS OPTIONAL. If you down it, it shows that your guild has insane skills, no more running into a door until it breaks. This way everyone has to be ontop of their game.<br />

He made a point: 1h per week is just an artificial way of increasing the time it takes to down Algalon. It's not difficulty or challenge (like ZA run) and it's not fun. Id prefer real difficulty, where you really have to train, instead of a 1h attempt each week, thats just lame.</div></div><hr />

Blizz has to stop ruining other specs because of one spec. Simple solution: Put a medium/deep holy talent that allows exorcism to be used against players, that way you stop ret from using it but don't punish people who enjoy the 37/0/34 spec for pure fun and versitility. <br />

Just a dose of thought would reveal this fix that will work for everyone, keeps ret from being OP and allows the shockadins to still have fun with such a jack of all trades spec. <br />

The problem here is this, really:<br />
If everybody in the raid knows all the tactics and executes them right, then that's it. Boss is down. One day, boom, dead boss, it doesn't matter than you wiped 15 hours to do it, all you have to do is get the tactics correct once to kill him.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the only way to counter a boss dying because of perfectly executed tactics is total RNG attacks from the boss, which Blizz has thankfully drifted away from. RNG attacks that instagib random members of the raid are far bigger cockblocks than having only one hour per week to do it right.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Most people will consider Ulduar fully cleared when Algalon is defeated, myself included.

What are the other options? Cockblock resistance gear? Cockblock mat farming? Cockblock doors so you can only get to phase 1 this week, then phase 2 next week? Cockblock RNG damage that kills random raid members to make a successful kill based more on luck than skill?<br />

An hour-per-week timer is about as close as we will ever get to a real, true skill-check, because you can't just wipe on him for hours on end until he goes down. You gotta do it right the first time, or you don't get to do it. As another poster said, this is really no different from the one-hour per week time limit to do a bear run in ZA.</div></div><hr />

I have one trivial question:<br />
<br />
Is'nt it already hard enough to get into there, in front of him ? Doesn't it already require a couple of times to manage the hard mode requirements to get the key. Remember that they have just buffed much hardmode encounters in ulduar.<br />
<br />
I see this 1 hour challenge like en extra reward... a (maybe?) well tuned boss you will only see for some effort. hey, it's ok...<br />
<br />
<br />
btw. it seems even a bit logical (sure, logic isn't rly a big component in the game^^) that he, the messanger between azeroth and the titans, doesn't want to play with u a couple of hoars. - he has to send a message, and u have to stop him ^^</div></div><hr />

Well said.<br />
I like that there's a one hour timer on Algalon, especially since there's a server first achievement and title for the boss.<br />
Zerg recruiting to have enough members to raid longer than guild X is no longer a requirement like it has been all WOTLK.<br />
Conquerer of Naxxramas, Obsidian Slayer, Magic Seeker, all based on leveling faster than X and raiding longer than guild X, the two ulduar server first achievements finally involves some skill instead of just pure time and it's gonna make the race a lot more fun instead of a chore.<br />
We'll probably see the timer removed shortly before the next raid instance is released, but for now I really do hope they keep the timer as it is.</div></div><hr />

All the 'Cockblocks' you mentioned are attempts by blizzard to forcibly lengthen the content by making people do things besides raiding in order to beat the boss. That is bad design. Raiders should have to raid to beat a boss. Nothing else.<br />
<br />
Restricting it to an hour a week is as pathetic as the SWP gates were.<br />
<br />
<br />
An hour-per-week timer is about as close as we will ever get to a real, true skill-check, because you can't just wipe on him for hours on end until he goes down. You gotta do it right the first time, or you don't get to do it. As another poster said, this is really no different from the one-hour per week time limit to do a bear run in ZA.<br />
First: Boss =/= Mount. They are similar, but as similar as a lump of clay is to a diamond; each has their uses, but one is vastly more valuable than the other.<br />
<br />
Secondly: The time restriction does not force players to be more skillful in order to defeat him. The guild that gets the world first kill on this boss will have done all the research possible (maybe even waited until several extremely-hardcore guilds have failed the hour time limit) then goes in with a pre-planned tactic and executes it.<br />
This does not make the encounter more difficult. This only makes it last a few weeks longer than it normally would.<br />
<br />
Thirdly (after reading a few other replies): It is blizzard's job to make a skill-check boss. That is the challenge their designers face. To normal people, like me, Razorscale and Ignis are a challenge. The purpose of Algalon the Observer is to be a challenge to the hardcore. From what I gather Yogg-Saron was actually challenging to the players who faced it and wiped on it for hours even when they finally got him down. Just because a boss was defeated within 48 hours of it's public release does not mean it was badly-designed. Adding artificial factors like &quot;one hour a week&quot; to a boss is their way of saying &quot;we're going to drag this out as long as we can&quot; and that is trying to make the content last longer than it actually should.<br />
Purely because blizzard is trying to do this: I hope Algalon is one-shotted.</div></div><hr />

ya pre nerf muru kj they were hard with out the one hour per reset thing. Now what if algalon is harder(which i am sure he is going to be) than muru + the only one hour per reset=a much more difficult encounter. as i said before its a challenge just like the bear runs in ZA to kill him before the time limit is up or better try next week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's also were my idea the post before you, might actually be quite nice. As you then will be able to fight him more then once.. but it will be harder each time but you can still fail and learn and try next week, when his strenght will be normal again etc.<br />

I would be perfectly happy to spend 5 hours a day, every day, for a week trying to learn the tactics for Algalon (assuming we made some progress over that week). Even if we never got passed 60% I would be prepared to do that in order to one day kill him.<br />

Definitely. However, the 'race' is part of what the complaining is about.<br />
This is a vast generalization and is probably not true. Right now I'm only complaining about the 1-hour-per-week restriction on Algalon. I don't expect to have any other complains about Ulduar.<br />

Right now the only thing I see that should be complained about is the 1-hour-a-week restriction.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand how you can say &quot;Why not just make an incredibly well tuned encounter with all new abilities and never before seen mechanics that would just be near impossible to beat for a long time&quot;<br />
<br />
The fact is, they can't. This game is too old, the best players are too experienced. Without putting something such as this time-lock on a boss, these encounters would be beat within the first week by the top guilds. Which, by most of your standards, means that it's easy and this game needs to be harder. So they give you an encounter that requires time management and insane skills. I don't think you've even begun to think about what this brings to the table. This will force guilds to be on their game 100% of the time while learning it. They'll need to think quickly about how to deal with his abilities because they know they only have a little longer to attempt him. They won't able to brute-force the boss for 18 hours to get him down. The guild that can adapt the easiest and fastest will be the first to kill Algalon, rather than the guild who spends the most time. <br />
<br />
You know how all of you guys have been complaining about how Blizzard caters to Casuals all the time? Well for once they're making an encounter for the Hardcore and all you do is whine. <br />
<br />
I imagine Algalon as the Water God from Madagascar 2. Rather, instead of sacrifices it's yours tears that he is full of.<br />

<br />
I agree the exorcism nerf was needed for ret in pvp. However, the nerf was shortsighted as it effected the rest of the class as well, not just the intended target.<br />
<br />
When Wrath came out, Shockadin was ended because of the Seal and judgement of righteousness change/nerf. It ended what was a favorite spec for many paladins, as it allowed you to raid heal, pvp damage, heroic damage, pvp heal, solo anything, the whole time allowing you a caster size mana bar to do those various roles at once without being intsa-OOM. It was a jack of all trades spec, but master of none. It was a very fun spec and personaly the most fun I had in wow.<br />
<br />
Then came the change to allow exorcism to be used against enemy players. This, for players like me, was a salvation as it took the place of judgement of righteousness as the ONE-TWO punch that made shockadin fun and brought the spec to life. For a week it was a blast playing this spec again and was looking forward to pvp again and increased solo capability. I also spent hundreds of Stone keeprs shards, 105 heroism badges, 30 WG marks and thousands of honor to get a shockadin pvp set going. <br />
<br />
Then came the next day in which a ninja nerf came out taking away exorcism yet again, without any notice whatsoever, right as several paladins on my server were setting up arena teams based around this fun hybrid spec. (37/0/34 or 33/0/38) and had already spent considerable resources getting ready. <br />
<br />
The target, Ret Pvp, was hit but also ruined other specs such as shockadin and even prot pvp to some degree. The solution to the ret burst was shortsighted and not well thought out. A better question is why after trying to squash ret pvp deeps since xpac release they would give ret another instant cast big damage ability in the first place. <br />
<br />
FAIR SOLUTION:<br />
<br />
1) Make a talent in the holy tree around the 25/30ish area allow exorcism to work on enemy players. Such as subsituting this in plce for the consecration mana cut in Purifying Power. That way you keep Ret from taking it yet do not nerf the innocent bystander, the shockadin. It would also allow raid healers to defend themselves better if you play on a real server and not a Care Bear one. <br />
<br />
2)Bring Seal and Judgement of Righteousness back to the way it was used in Burning Crusade as far as damage percenage and scaling factor. Ret dosen't use it, and it would still give the one-two punch necessary for a shockadin. This solution would still be a nerf to shockadin because judgement would be the other punch instead of having exorcism and judgement, but it would work just fine. <br />
<br />
Both of these solutions are very quick fixes and could be made in a hot fix next tuesday maintenance, just as fast as the nerfs came. Both solutions keep the intended target (Ret) under control without destroying the rest of the class. <br />
<br />
My only request is for the decision makers involved to not just ZOMG NERF things without thinking of ways to do it without collateral damage to the other specs,. Especially after only one week with no warning, with a problem every wow player saw coming. Even more frustrating is it nerfs a spec collaterally that wasn't taking anyone's raid spots or arena titles anyway, just a blast and favorite fun spec for many players. <br />
<br />
Thanks for your time.</div></div><hr />

Gratz to Wraith to have unlocked it so fast (to bad im not on Ysondre anymore).<br />
<br />
I WANT to see him in game just once... doubt il ever be able to do it. But he is still AWESOME, gratz Blizzard for this, real WOLTK expension start a 3.1 (3.1.1 tomorow &gt;&lt;) if you ask me. Naxxramas was juste a joke to make us wait. Can't wait to see Icecrown Citadel if they managed to make something that gorgeous for the middle tier raid of the expansion. <br />
<br />
<br />
And to all of those who QQ about the 1 hour timer, just start by unlock him and try him before QQing like 5 years old childs This timer will probably be nerfed/remove before most of the people even unlock him. So get over it.<br />

<br />
A boss, optional or not, is progression to me. Beside, I thought Algalon would have better loot? Thats progression. The real point here though is that a time limit of 1 hour per week is just stupid, is not a challenge and makes something takes ages more than it should for no reason. Its a cock block.<br />
<br />
<br />
So much ignorance. So much bullshit. So much QQ. You people just dont get it. For months now, since the realease of WoTLK, players have been whining about the &quot;eazy&quot; mode of the game . So Blizzard makes ONE encounter, who is optional btw, difficult. Besides probably being the hardest boss so far in WoTLK they also put in a timer. For weeks now, we have gotten small teasers here on MMO-Champion about this so-called raid-destroyer. The one thing that caught my eye the most was; He feeds on your tears. He already does that. He feeds on your damn QQ. Cry me and Algalon a damn fucking river.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a: get a boss thats hard<br />
b: give to the raid one hour / each week<br />
<br />
If you think about a bit, let say, blizzard give one hour for yogg saron each week, noone would have been killed him yet, and everyone would say &quot;omfg its impossible wtf nerf hack cheat&quot;<br />
<br />
If you go on this line, Algalon cannot be seroiusly hard boss, probably would be possible to faceroll him like yogg saron with lot of trys, but with this move, they can avoid a fast cleared instance, they can repeat themselves &quot;silence till u cleared ulduar&quot; etc etc<br />
<br />
But in my opinion, its not a hard boss. IT something like a blizzard helping to the boss from background, like if one random boss would always go for the healers first, if you give a limit, when you can try the boss, you dont make him harder, you make him look harder, and thats two different story.<br />
<br />
ppl can say, yes yes, but those guilds worth the kill, whos can use that 60min the most wisely, thats right, but it dosen't change the thing, that Blizzard make look the boss hard, and not itself the boss hard</div></div><hr />

In my statement of fact, you have not yet faced Algalon, just like the rest of us, and cannot assert how hard or easy he is.<br />
<br />
If the facerolling he just gave the first guild to reach him is any indication, however, he should be more than enough to stomp you back to your groundhole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He made a point: 1h per week is just an artificial way of increasing the time it takes to down Algalon. It's not difficulty or challenge (like ZA run) and it's not fun. Id prefer real difficulty, where you really have to train, instead of a 1h attempt each week, thats just lame.<br />
<br />
<br />
Think again... its exactly the same mechanic as timed ZA, but focused on one boss. Your raid ID had 1 shot at a timed ZA run per week. You either executed properly in that one hour each week or you failed and had to wait for reset to try again. <br />
<br />
How is that different than the Algalon hour? The added difficulty is clearing the hard modes to attune for the attempt... not that it matters too much unless it takes the raid 6 days and 23.5 hours to finish the attunement. Its going to be one hour on Algalon no matter what raid day you get to him.</div></div><hr />

Yep, absolutely.<br />
<br />
It's pretty worrying how the only argument people seem to have for this is 'LOL HE FEEDS OFF YOUR TEARS QQ'. That's great. That doesn't make this mechanic any less stupid. It doesn't make the boss any harder and especially not any more fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is worrying is how people don't seem to understand precisely why it does increase the difficulty - with such a minimal window of time to do fight attempts in, you must have your strategy totally worked out before pulling, and then must execute it all the way through and compensate for any and all variations that might come up during the fight. You can't just smash your head against him for umpteen hours until he goes down, you need to get it right the first time around. It demands peak skill from every member of the raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If killing bosses was a matter of 'smashing your head against him for umpteen hours', then perhaps you would be right. However, as Annoying already said, that's just not the case.<br />
<br />
It doesn't change the difficulty of the actual fight in the slightest, it's nothing more than an artificial way to frustrate and annoy people.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's a boss. He's hard. He's progression.<br />
<br />
That'd be like eating a Thanksgiving dinner, only to find out there's no turkey because grandma decided it was &quot;Optional&quot; and that just the potatoes, corn, and gravy would be good enough this year.<br />
<br />
He was released with the instance, toted as &quot;The Raid Destroyer,&quot; and the Hard Mode Only boss that you can only get to by completing other bosses hard modes.<br />
<br />
If you say &quot;Optional&quot; you may as well say Ulduar as a whole is &quot;Optional&quot;. WoW as a whole is &quot;Optional.&quot; You can choose to play or not play.<br />
<br />
I guess my point is... Stop saying he's &quot;Optional&quot; to try to shut the QQers up. They'll whine, you'll whine, people will whine about the whining whiners.<br />
<br />
I, for one, am pleased about the one hour per week thing... Seeing &quot;Yogg Saron DOWN!&quot; 30-some hours after the patch hit is boring. I look forward to waiting out the world first kill. It'll be done by the guild with the most skill(and maybe a little rng luck). It's exactly as one poster pointed out... You learn a little and chip the block a little farther each week, not smash yourself against a wall waiting for it to crack.<br />
<br />
I'm personally hoping the 25-man version is VASTLY different than the 10 man version of Alagon, that way big guilds can't just attempt one version over and over and carry the knowledge to the other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's nothing like Vael back in bwl, cause vael was blocking out 6 remaining bosses, algon doesnt block anything. He's extra. It's also not a progession cockblock, i didn't see people cry about viscidus as much as this. Because peolpe could clear the rest of the instance. And so you can in ulduar.<br />
<br />
Why can't blizzard do what they want, what if they promise people 10 bosses but decide to do 1 extra that's almost unkillable (weither the factor be time, difficulty or a combination fo both). Who are you to decide it should be easier ? Let the &quot;elite&quot; raiders have something exclusive for once. Blizzard has already adapted enough so that multiple &quot;level&quot; of guilds can complete the instance. And no i'm not a hardcore raider, used to be but ive played both casual and hardcore and this 1hour time limit wouldnt bother me at all.<br />
<br />
If you don't agree with the way Algalon was implemented it's probably because you will never kill him being held back by cripples in your guild. Suck it up.</div></div><hr />

&quot;If you have worked hard this week you may try the turkey now. But only a tiny piece of it and in one minute the dinner will be over. So better hurry up and try to get the full taste of it.

On the other hand, if it is just temporary block made just to delay the world first -crowd from clearing all current content too fast, then it will be lifted after some time has passed and it has done its job of delaying the content clear.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jeffemming</div><div class="date">2009-04-22, 11:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What is worrying is how people don't seem to understand precisely why it does increase the difficulty - with such a minimal window of time to do fight attempts in, you must have your strategy totally worked out before pulling, and then must execute it all the way through and compensate for any and all variations that might come up during the fight. You can't just smash your head against him for umpteen hours until he goes down, you need to get it right the first time around. It demands peak skill from every member of the raid.<br />
As has been said before me, yet in nicer terms, this argument is predicated on you being a retard.<br />
<br />
If you're spending 15 hours on a boss it's not &quot;banging your head against him,&quot; it's learning what the boss does and how to effectively deal with it. The first few guilds who attempt him probably get very little information from each attempt. Beyond that, with a 1 hour time limit, you don't have TIME to talk about each thing and parse through combat logs to see how much damage each thing is doing, etc. That week is pretty much devoted to doing what you thought would work before you went in.<br />
<br />
I've never been in the position of having to learn each ability a boss has, or extracting the data from the game files, but I can't imagine formulating a strat is something really anyone commenting on this thread has had to deal with. I'd be interested to see what Xi would have to say about this if he were still leading DnT, given his rant on C'thun's impossibility (though clearly impossible and a fixed time limit are different).<br />
<br />
As has also been said, it's pretty unfair to the guilds who reach him first. There's going to be a point where the encounter is cracked and people know all of his abilities, how to effectively avoid them, and then the 1 hour resets really start to matter. That's when you can dedicate your skill to flawlessly pulling off attempts, but even then it's pretty much reliant on no latency issues. Do you know how many guilds have been put out of Immortal contention because of unforeseen and unpreventable disconnects/lags? I'm not even talking about the server as a WHOLE but the individuals. That's 25 ways to ruin your reset. This isn't the best medium to expect &quot;pixel perfect jumps.&quot;<br />
<br />
The last point that NEEDS to be made is that the horrifically flawed assumption that the same people who are complaining about the bosses being &quot;too easy&quot; and &quot;too hard&quot; are the same people. Do you guys have any grasp on logic? There may be some overlap, but christ, you're really making yourselves look dense when you say things like &quot;First THEY complain about X and then THEY complain about Y.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You keep saying that word. I don't think it means what you think it means.<br />
<br />
The definition of this slang, as I understand it, is when someone or something prevents you from getting laid, i.e. a little sister who won't go to bed when your girlfriend is over, or a stupid, loud, drunk friend who comes bothering you everytime you're hitting on a girl at the bar. <br />
<br />
This is not a cockblock. Hell, playing WoW in-of-itself can be a cockblock. Having your friend tell a girl you're talking to that you play WoW all the time is a cockblock. A mechanism in said game that makes a particular victory more difficult to achieve is more of a 'How determined and skilled of a nerd are you?' check. <br />
<br />
The '1 hour a week' thing. Yes, its intended to make it so that it takes longer for Joe T. Average Raid Guild to complete it. It's also intended to make it far more challenging, in that instead of just being able to wipe on it for hours at a time until you figure it out so that you can just hit the buttons in a particular order without looking like Dragon Quest, you actually yes, need to be on your A-game and it will take weeks to work it out, not days.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: It's not a 'cockblock'. Those saying it is have never encountered a real one in their lives, on account of there being no potential for ass in their life to have thwarted. Also, Algalon looks fucking awesome.</div></div><hr />

so you guys think that trying an encounter 1 hour/week is hard? lol.<br />
<br />
<br />
1 weeks ago we had 1k posts of QQ saying BWL toke like 3 or 6 months to be cleared and ulduar had 12h (without hard modes). Now the BWL nightmare is back QQ ll start? give me a break!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
now since all these top guilds have the same chance to go for the world first kill of algalon what is funny to me is that they are going to be super secretive about there fights i think<br />
<br />
if they are any serious at all about world first...because since you only have a small window every week to get the world first you need to be 95%+ on every part of the fight and you are basically going to be making up a strat at the same time...if you find a strat that is very close to working then you aren't going to tell anybody if nobody finds out your special strat. on the fight<br />
<br />
idk that's just the way i see it panning out...personally though i'm gonna up the time it takes ensidia(still my first choice{alongwith everyone else} to get world first on algalon) about a month to take him down...</div></div><hr />

There's nothing flawed about my argument. My primary argument was with the use of the term 'cockblock' in regards to the Algalon encounter's time limit. This argument is sound.<br />
<br />
What I didn't include in my argument about the time limit on the Algalon encounter (which I would have, if I thought people like this could read more than 2 paragraphs before something shiny distracts them) is this:<br />
<br />
This time limit on Algalon is designed to yes, prevent the 'World First' from happening too soon, but also, to seperate the great from the merely good. What this encounter will do, set up this way, is give the World's First Kill achievement to the group that is not only the strongest, but also the most skilled and least affected by latency guild out there. In short, if those who achieve getting to Algalon are akin to the Marines, The World's First'ers will be SEALs - the baddest of asses.<br />
<br />
It would be awesome, if for a change, when groups get to this encounter, they keep all the strategy they learn to themselves, instead of spreading it all over the 'net, where any chump can just read up on it and apply it to their raid... <br />
<br />
EDIT: Clarifying a bit of a fail on my armed forces reference. I think Marines are totally badass. However, I think SEALs are the baddest of asses.</div></div><hr />

if there would be an encounter where people would wipe 24/7, sharing all tactics but still fail on it, I'd call it an hard encounter! this is just a waste of time, please stfu with the &quot;ITS OPTIONAL&quot; bs, there is content, you want to clear it, you pay for the game and want to play it when you want with all aspects...<br />
<br />
blizzard cleary failed at making the encounter HARD itself, they probably need more time to tune it before removing the time limit, like they did it on vael in BWL, which most ppl wont remember, because they still wiped on razorgore back then.<br />
(the gates didnt open if you still managed to down vael back then, just to show you thats its just a poor way of making things hard. and the timelimit will change 100% if the encounter is proper fixed...)<br />

<br />
It's very simple... Here's a hypothetical.<br />
It's Tuesday, and the raid timers have just been reset. Your group has cleared to a new boss. We'll call it Boss A.<br />
<br />
Boss A: No specific time limit for attempts at the encounter during this reset, but is very difficult and there are no posted strategies available, and you want to take it out.<br />
<br />
You wipe. You have initial strategy based on what was seen.<br />
Wipe #2. You have additional input.<br />
Wipe #3 - You've gotten further now based on your first 2 revisions, into the bosses' next phase, and have new information. (this IS a hypothetical.)<br />
Wipe #4 - et cetera. It has now been an hour. You are able to keep going with this progression, or do something else, you can come back to it tomorrow.<br />
<br />
Boss B - Algalon. 1 Hour timit limit per week.<br />
<br />
Wipes #1 - #4 are the same. But it ends there. You cannot try again tomorrow, but will have to clear all that content again to get to it, and apply what you've learned to next week's raid.<br />
<br />
This is brutal. Yes. Blizzard frankly and boldly says Algalon will feed on your tears. It is evident; Al will need weight watchers from the wah in this thread alone. I just don't see it as a cop-out on Blizzard's part, like so many seem to - I see it as what it is; a hearty challenge. It means you will have to have a core group of people dedicated to the cause of downing this boss, that you will need to analyze every encounter you do have with the boss in order to optimize your strategy, that you will have to royally own in order to be the first in the world/on your server/etc to take him down. Algalon is supposed to be hard-mode all by himself - like being tied to a tree that is then set on fire. The time limit is like someone tickling you as you're trying to escape from this. What a confusing way to die.<br />

It is learning, but it's brute force learning. This is the difference you don't seem to understand. Not being able to use pure trial and error, makes the encounter harder. Imagine you have a test in school and you can take it as many time as you want. But another student only gets one shot, who has it harder?<br />

Do you know how many guilds have been put out of Immortal contention because of unforeseen and unpreventable disconnects/lags? I'm not even talking about the server as a WHOLE but the individuals.

<br />
It's like the people who are complaining refuse to acknowledge that the hour limit makes it harder. It does. Let me repeat that in bold<br />

THE HOUR LIMIT MAKES THE ENCOUNTER HARDER!!!!<br />
<br />
Perhaps you don't like they way it makes it harder. That's an legitimate opinion. I don't like that just because a guild has 25 instead of 10 they should see harder content. But it would be silly for me to not acknowledge that it is indeed more difficult to get 25 people working together then 10.<br />
<br />
<br />
seriously, you guys suck badly. if you think a hard encounter is made by testing it once a week you fail.<br />
<br />
If you don't think that giving players less time to do something doesn't make it harder. Then I don't know how to explain it to you.<br />
<br />
It's like trying to guess a password in 3 attempts as opposed to infinite. One is harder then the other.</div></div><hr />

Grats, you're doing the exact same thing.<br />
<br />
Look, this boss CAN be killed in an hour. At most lets say he takes 20 mins to kill, that gives you 3 intense fun filled tries.<br />
<br />
I would imagine he isn't even possible to kill in current gear. You would need to be outfitted in the gear from all the ulduar hard-mode bosses (whatever ilvl that is) to even have a shot at him. Which means it would take a few weeks of running Ulduar to even be able to down him if you had unlimited time.<br />
<br />
This week my guild tried the new Vault boss for the first time. We had just about 25 minutes to down him as that's what was left on the battle timer. We finally did it with 3 minutes to spare.. and let me tell you the satisfaction was amazing having only limited time and actually downing him.</div></div><hr />
