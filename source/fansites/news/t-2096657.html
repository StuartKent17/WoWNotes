Patch 7.1 - Darkwater Skate<br />
The Darkwater Skate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/142398-darkwater-skate) is a new aquatic mount coming to the Darkmoon Faire in Patch 7.1. It is sold by Galissa Sundew (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/55103-galissa-sundew), who uses Darkmoon Daggermaw (http://www.wowdb.com/items/124669-darkmoon-daggermaw) as a currency.<br />

Class Feedback and Solo Play<br />
one dev plays fire mage, so that has to be uber strong, no dev plays elemental shaman so we pretend that specc doesn't exist. etc<br />
<br />
Considering the WoW development team consists of hundreds of people, it is very likely that there is at least one person on the team playing your class and spec. I think a lot of people are misinterpreting, or even twisting, what Ornyx has said.<br />
<br />
While the developers have their own philosophies, vision and game design in mind, they ultimately want the end product to be something that players will enjoy. This does not mean that any feedback to the contrary will be disregarded. Even from as early a stage as when we enter Friends &amp; Family testing with our products, the products can change quite significantly based on the feedback received. However, if the changes would compromise the overall vision, then the developers may disagree with making those changes. That doesn’t mean that they don’t care for, or appreciate, the feedback.<br />
<br />
To use the restaurant example that comes up quite a lot in this thread:<br />
If the developers were chefs, they wouldn't want to open a restaurant serving food that they would not be willing to eat themselves. However, they are only human and sometimes a dish isn't served to perfection, a mistake gets made, or a dish needs a little bit more preparation than others. Sometimes a dish simply requires a little bit of salt…<br />
<br />
To tie this back into the ongoing concerns about class balance, we've recently received some information about philosophy and potential changes for Outlaw Rogues and Havoc Demon Hunters.<br />
<br />
However, if your class and/or spec isn't mentioned there it doesn't mean that we are ignoring you. We're collating all the feedback we're receiving and forwarding it on. I realise it's frustrating to be left waiting but please understand that if we receive any information we can share with you, then we will of course share it with you.<br />
<br />
WQ´s are great, but they stop progressing at 850, Crafting is great, but it also stops progressing at 850 + it requires mythic dungeons, HC dungeons don´t offer progress, LFR doesn´t, non rated BG doesn't ...<br />
<br />
There are so many things that don´t work, as you guys don´t put effort into them. You serve them to your playerbase in such a way, that they must get the impression, that you don´t care about them, but only your own kind - the raiders and mythic dungeon players, as this content is what you do as well and therefore put lots of effort into.<br />
The re-design of Kara, damn it´s great, but it´s not accessible by the majority of your players, therefore they can never see how much work went into it and this is a problem.<br />
<br />
What your team needs is a casual, who does not raid or do these dungeons, someone who is telling you every evening in the office, that he has nothing meaningful to do. I am sure this would change things to the good.<br />
We have some new content coming in Patch 7.1 tailored toward solo-play (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/20324478/patch-7-1-preview-new-adventures-in-the-broken-isles) as well as some changes coming to non-rated PvP (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/news/20324477/pvp-rewards-in-patch-7-1) that should make it feel more rewarding.<br />
<br />
With the recent changes to emissary caches to give gear more in-line with rewards from World Quests, it is possible to get up to a gear level comparable to that of mythic dungeons without even setting foot in a mythic dungeon. You still have chances for those rewards to Warforge or Titanforge and be on the same level as rewards from higher difficulty Mythic Keystone dungeons. In this regard, gear is more accessible than ever before.<br />
<br />
We've been seeing a lot of requests over the years for more organised smaller group content, this originally took the form of Challenge Modes and has since transitioned into the current Mythic Keystone system. Base mythic dungeons are fundamentally designed around a level of communication and co-operation that automatically match-made groups often lack.<br />
<br />
Organised group content that requires commitment should have a reward that correlates to the investment required. This is why higher difficulty dungeons and raids have a more consistent chance of providing a more powerful reward when compared to hoping that the 830 World Quest reward will Titanforge up to 860+, but either way no matter which content you do, there is still a chance that you're going to get an upgrade.<br />
<br />
Karazhan holds a special place in many players’ hearts because it's an iconic location in Warcraft lore and was one of the first truly accessible raids for players in terms of the number of players and co-ordination required, even when compared the 20 man versions of Zul'Gurub or Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj in classic WoW.<br />
<br />
At BlizzCon, and through talking to fans, I've often heard stories of friendships and guilds that were formed and blossomed as a result of Karazhan. By making Karazhan a mythic dungeon it allows us to attempt to re-capture that spirit of Karazhan by promoting more organised, smaller group, play again.<br />
<br />
Like I said in this thread (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17613763578?page=3#post-50), I don't think it's inherently bad for World of Warcraft to offer solo-experiences, but on the flipside I don't think it's inherently bad for the game to offer organised small group activities either. One of WoW's strengths has always been the breadth of content if offers for different playstyles.

Elemental Shaman Concerns<br />
I've also gathered concerns from this thread (among others) and sent them to the development team with a round of questions on our goals/philosophy for Elemental. <br />
<br />
Once I hear back from them I'll share what I can. Thanks for your patience in the meantime! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/777812-elementals-just-want-dialogue-part-2/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20749717575?page=30#587))<br />

Youre talking about giving Spriests choice in 100 Talents tier? Meanwhile literally no choice for Hunter talent trees.#LetsTalk<br />
I believe I mentioned the lack of choice/options in the Barrage/Sidewinders rows for Marks; which others concern you? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/787320980804890624))<br />
<br />
Raiding<br />
Then Blizz deciding raiding was too expensive and worked to fix it. Being &quot;Raid Ready&quot; isn't a new thing like you suggest.<br />
BC still had chain-potting with no one-per-combat limit; and in 2.0/2.1, elixirs stacked with flasks. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/787325269212295168))<br />
Anyway, I don't think we disagree. As said in the Q&amp;A, if the market still looks like this in a month or so, that's a problem. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/787325460514471936))<br />

PvP<br />
will pvp season end with 7.1 arrival?<br />
No, Legion Season 1 will not end when 7.1 launches on Oct. 25th. https://t.co/a3P0uIo4FB (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/787299938174545920))<br />

Hidden Things<br />
Still cant believe this community figured out Kosumoth. That was the one I thought would take the longest. What did you think of it? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787119324058128384))<br />
The first person in each region that unlocked the final Kosumoth orb had their name announced to the region. Did you notice? Was this cool? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787120872498749440))<br />
<br />
Will you guys ever do another secret based around spirit form and wandering the world dead?<br />
I hope not (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787387417493766144))<br />
<br />
Holiday Events<br />
Any way you could scale holiday events? Want chances at goodies, but all my alts are still 100, not the 110 needed to participate.<br />
a very good idea, love it! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/787127602406240258))<br />

Pet Battles<br />
Could you tell (or hint) us whether or not this mini pet is in the current live game? and if not, will it… https://t.co/dMCZiqYYq7<br />

its a huge hint that legion will have only 2 tiers just liek wod - jsut with first tier much more spread will february (nighthold) and next out of raid gear will come when next tier lands - untill then it will be one huge rng bonanza - and 3/4 of people leaving game due to it still being raid or die</div></div><hr />

as a casual player, its never been easier to get into raiding. or mythics. or mythic + dungeons. this is the most accessible xpac to date, and its still not enough? at what point do you just say, &quot;go play skyrim?&quot; (or any other single player game?) its an MMO. it favors group content.

<br />
Thats exactly what I have been saying, so far 2 hard to get mounts (morgoss/kosu) now an easier one. All water based, these serve no purpose outside of a water themed area. Being that we are in the Lost Isles, it only makes sense that we gotta do some underwater stuff. With all the underwater beauty to discover in the ocean floor areas, it would seem to be a waste to go through the trouble to add the tropical lushness and ships and not have anything down there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although I want to say yes with all the ruins and such that are dotted around the coastline of the Broken Isles that look like something should be there but unfortunately these mounts are really underwhelming once you get to actually using them. They move way slower than most water walking/swimming speed buffs that you can get in WoW and coupled with the fact that you're still drowning whilst using them is disappointing. I mean I spent time farming for that Mount from Margoss and once I was able to buy it, I was really annoyed that it was slower than Swim Speed Potion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/6372-swim-speed-potion) and even slower than my usual swim speed.</div></div><hr />

The answer to many casual players isn't here take some RNG rolls and waste your time getting 830 WQ items to titanforge to 850+ (for the 10% item that actually have the proper stats), you might log on for an hour or two a day, for months with no progression but we dont care seems to be blizzards statement, that's fine but you will see a major decline in subs, it's already happening, because that shit just isn't fun as a casual player.<br />
<br />
Give us something like valor to upgrade our existing items 5 ilvl at a time, something we can actually progress on, yes it will take alot of time to upgrade all the gear, but sure beats RNG that have 0,0001% chance of rolling anything useful, this way you actually dont feel fucked over everytime you log off after a play session.<br />
<br />
Put a hard cap on the upgrade level (fx now with legendaries @ 895), at say 870, the special snowflake mythic guys will still get higher gear, but at least gives the rest of us something useful to log in to the game for, personally my time atm is CIV6&gt;WOW because the RNG on RNG on RNG on RNG in wow just killed my desire to log in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The comment was that progression stops at 850... If you don't progress. There are mythic and mythic + dungeons, which are the next step in the progression, if you are looking for small-group content.<br />
<br />
If you are looking at LFR, there is Normal raiding.<br />
<br />
At some point, interacting with humans becomes part of the 'difficulty' that needs to be overcome.<br />
<br />
Now, as the expansion develops, if there are are not newer and 'higher' quests, dungeons, crafting, and raids, there will be a legitimate beef. As of right now, there is not.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
He's right, they need someone standing next to their desk reminding them that raids are not the only way to entertain people over time, and that &quot;getting lootz!&quot; is not the only way to provide content. <br />
<br />
It's funny, though, because they almost always come out with new quest hubs in content patches, and the very next patch features a 'new' 5-man dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
... You do realize that there's only one raid out, right? So, if I've beaten the raid, am I just left with 'die'? I have beaten it on Normal. So, what now? You can't really say heroic, because you've stated above that you don't consider increased difficulty to be 'progression'.<br />
<br />
Further, if you're not just looking for upgrades ('fat lootz'), why does hitting an ilevel matter? You've either done all the dungeons and world quests, or not. In an ideal world, every content patch would release with a quest hub, 5-man, raid, PVP feature, and crafting patterns. Alas, we don't live in that world. The game can't be all things to all people at all times.<br />

If that's how you play the game, well, yea, your desire to log in is going to crater.<br />
<br />
If, instead, you play because:<br />
<br />
1) Playing the game is fun...<br />
2) You enjoy spending time with your friends...<br />
<br />
You'll be just fine.<br />
<br />
Just curious... Do they have a 'valor' system in CIV 6 that allows you to upgrade your gear, or do you just have fun playing the game?<br />
<br />
(Super duper life secret: If you worry about 'progression' in real life, you can save video games as a time to just have fun.)</div></div><hr />

It's the same nonsense people tell everytime, maybe because even casual players don't want to waste their time? better items means less time spent killing xyz outside raid content, hell they could even make the items useless in the current raid instances for all i care, news flash even if casuals get good 870 items they wont be competing against you guys in mythic raiding / mythic 5+ dungs.<br />

<br />
It gives a feeling of progression of your characters power, not progression as raiders are thinking, the progression for me isn't now you can do HC/Mythic or Mythic+ dungs, for me it means i can now progress faster on all the stuff i do besides raiding/mythic dungs, the mindset is completely different.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

I have been in many guilds as a casual/casual hc raider, it's always been the same, you have a small groups of 5 people that always plays together, they have their own sub cliques within the guild that always do the same things together, so you are left with pugging to get any 5m content done.<br />
<br />
I'm not a super social guy, i don't find it fun to constantly trying to kiss people asses in the off chance of getting in a small clique, i just want to spend my time playing the game, there is truly no one in any of the guilds i would consider friends, friends is what i got in the real lífe, we just have different perspectives of what an MMO means, and such is life.<br />

Dude - go play Skyrim. You're basing your opinion off of one individual experience. Player interaction is apart of the WoW experience. There's not much point in playing an MMO if you refuse to engage with others. There's a ton of other games appealing to that market, don't try and force WoW to change to that model. If you're playing a solo experience, iLevel hardly matters because things dealing with a one-on-one experience only scale with level, not gear. So who cares if you guys' cap out with 850 gear? Stop trying to convert the game. It's always been about raiding, and now Mythic pluses make a smaller atmosphere even better. Your experience with &quot;the cliques&quot; just sounds like you're upset about raiding.</div></div><hr />

Funny I spent a few years climbing the ladder in guilds, got to damn near the top in Cat, server hopping/faction changing, only to watch that melt down/merge evolve later.<br />
<br />
I'm back at my old wrath guild, which will end up top 75 yet again. I'm not great friends with most of the Mythic team, they came years after I and the HLK 25 days and I were gone. But... there are a few of we &quot;retired raiders&quot; from the old days there, as welll as a Now/NewlyHusband and wife I raided TBC with, on a different server before they were &quot;together. <br />
My neighbor and friend down the street and his son still hardcore raid on another server, I'm buddies in RL but not in game. <br />
<br />
I ran into my old ex hardcore GM as he was casually questing, we real IDed and ran some stufff together. <br />
I'm sure when Kara drops I'll cobble together a 5 man team, comprised of my Old Wrath GM, the couple I raided old Kara with back in TBC and some new friends in guild. <br />

In short I'll spend my time with people I like being around, not some ego maniacs, and not putting in 200 wipes a night, and that's fine. Gear is just a means to an end, but getting there is the fun part.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To phonetically spell IPA [zan], you use &quot;zahn&quot;, not &quot;zhan&quot;, which is the phonetic spelling of IPA [ʒan]. I've never heard anyone use the /ʒ/ sound (found in words like &quot;azure&quot; or &quot;leisure&quot;) when saying Karazhan.<br />
<br />
The options should be:<br />
<br />
Kah-ra-zahn (first and last vowels rhyme with &quot;far&quot;)<br />
Ka-ra-zan (first and last vowels rhyme with &quot;van&quot;)<br />
Ka-ra-zahn (first vowel rhymes with &quot;van&quot;, last vowel rhymes with &quot;far&quot;)<br />
Kah-ra-zan (first vowel rhymes with &quot;far&quot;, last vowel rhymes with &quot;van&quot;)<br />
<br />
And there's really no correct pronunciation, because different dialects of English will use IPA /æ/ or IPA /a/ regardless of the original pronunciation, even for loan words. See any Canadian or Brit saying &quot;pasta&quot; or &quot;mazda&quot; or &quot;taco&quot; (they use /æ/).</div></div><hr />

&quot;Karazhan holds a special place in many players’ hearts because it's an iconic location in Warcraft lore and was one of the first truly accessible raids for players in terms of the number of players and co-ordination required, even when compared the 20 man versions of Zul'Gurub or Ruins of Ahn'Qiraj in classic WoW.<br />
<br />
At BlizzCon, and through talking to fans, I've often heard stories of friendships and guilds that were formed and blossomed as a result of Karazhan. By making Karazhan a mythic dungeon it allows us to attempt to re-capture that spirit of Karazhan by promoting more organised, smaller group, play again.&quot;<br />
<br />
re-capture the spirit for 20% of the players..<br />
and the rest is out, because its a mythic only content!<br />
<br />
this statement show the lack of reality what players are the most in wow are.</div></div><hr />

Also, the differences are so minor that it doesn't really matter. Chalk it up to regional accents, just like in the real world.</div></div><hr />

Because the 80% of players that doesnt do lfr normal raid myth+ o can't myth dung due to no LFG, are fucking trash.<br />
<br />

Also 3/4 of users that post in this thread about &quot;lack of reality from blizzard&quot; are prob lazy fat ass that miss the good ol days of WOD with free epix while gathering herb from garrison. #such immersion</div></div><hr />

Can't imagine why anybody wouldn't be interested in that. Such gems of personality just waiting to be uncovered...<br />
<br />
Not sure why a valor-type system would be such a threat to raiders but holy hell does it seem to raise hackles. Like a pile of vipers fanning their hoods and hissing.<br />

You talk like mythic dungeons are hard. They're really not. We (very casual raiding guild) were clearing mythics with no real issue at 820. Try them, nowhere near as hard as you might think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No they're not hard, but even though I've been running them I do wish I could skip past the pre-made garbage. Most of my current group works night shift so only available on weekends. My old team is raiding in the evenings when I'm on bc they're in a different time zone. So I've found myself being solo during the week. It's not a problem so far with the amount of things to do, but it could become one if we get another content drought. Sure I can pug, but realistically the only toon that gets an invite in a timely manner is my healer. Starting a group solo as a DPS often ends up being pointless.</div></div><hr />
