Thanks to your help testing WoW Classic, we’ve fixed many additional reported bugs since the Beta ended last month. To really ensure that these fixes are all functioning as expected and prepare the smoothest possible launch in two weeks, we’ve just re-opened our closed beta realms for additional testing of WoW Classic.<br />
<br />
All testers who previously had access to the closed beta are now able to log into those realms. Characters that were previously created on the beta test realms were removed, and level 40-character templates are now available. The level cap has been increased to 45. Characters in this range will find level-appropriate quests to explore in zones such as Stranglethorn Vale, Swamp of Sorrows, Dustwallow Marsh, and Desolace.<br />
<br />
As before, please use the in-game Bug Report button to submit issues encountered while testing. If you need more text space to explain an issue you encountered, please take it to our WoW Classic Support and Bug Report forum (https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/c/wow-classic/support-and-bug-report), which is now open for new threads.<br />
<br />
This final closed beta test will end on Friday, 16 August.<br />
<br />
Thanks in advance to everyone who jumps in to test WoW Classic and help us prepare for its worldwide release on 27 August at 12:01 a.m. CEST!</div></div><hr />

Agreed. No amount of Beta testing will fix what is a fundamentally archaic, slow and broken game. <br />

All I know is I did 1-10 undead priest on stress test this weekend. Every level felt like an accomplishment and I went through 2 levels grinding just getting my wand made.<br />
<br />
I did the same this on a live priest yesterday, took me under and hour and went so fast with so little effort it was boring to me. <br />

<br />
There's still &quot;work for it&quot; approach, it just doesn't apply as much to leveling and leveling only after so many years.<br />
<br />
Get excited about that? Knock yourself out. Others stopped finding leveling this journey of mystery upon getting their X(X)th alt to max level.<br />
<br />
Never underestimate just how delusional Classic flaggers are with their &quot;This matters in Classic but has been REMOVED in Retail!!&quot;-approach though. Apparently, we're literally prevented from meeting people, having fun and feeling rewarded all at the same time. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

BFA is like having sensory overload with a ton of instant gratification while Classic is more of a slog that actually feels rewarding once you manage to achieve something, be it a new abillity, gear or even new relationships. <br />
<br />
I don't hate BFA, I've played it quite a lot, but retail is just not for me anymore - not with classic released.</div></div><hr />

I dont understand how it is such a hard pill to swallow that not only CAN they exist together, they will rely on each other. <br />
<br />
There is no harm in having classic as an option attached to the regular sub, this will help keep subs steady in content droughts as people or even who guilds could go back and progress through old raids. And sure, many are looking forward to classic don't want to do retail, and that is fine too. Stop being cheap asses complaining about a sub fee when you are getting, in my opinion, the one thing pservers could never offer. Security for your stuff. Not gonna wake up tomorrow and find your server been shut down.</div></div><hr />

How the heck is Classic going to mitigate content droughts when it is in its entirety a literal content drought?<br />
Classic's content is finite. There will be no new content patches and there is no mystery because we know everything there is already about Vanilla.<br />
The game is in perpetual stasis. Where nothing will change and nothing matters. (And classic fanboys have the nerve to call BFA a hamster wheel. Psh!)<br />

Only difference was back then they gave free gametime compensation for the occasion of bad server performance. And tickets were actually answered by GMs not pre-programmed robots and interns from 3rd world countries.</div></div><hr />

I feel bad for him. he's been posting pretty much vehemently anti-classic stuff for weeks to antagonize others, and more than anything just comes across as a very insecure youth or a BFA player who has no faith in the product so has to attack the other.<br />

<br />
It'll have roughly I'd say a 1 year lifespan with it's planned content release schedule. It's a perfect companion for the 6 month tiers of BfA, if people are happy playing retail 6 months currently in 8.2 doing the same Neck Essences/AP/Daily grinding on mains/alts until the next patch that's fine but how the hell can people stomach doing that idk.<br />
<br />
Most people should have like another 7-8 weeks until neck level 70 which is the cap and essences apart from rank 4 (cosmetic). There really isn't much to do after that except farming mounts/pets if that's your thing.<br />
<br />
We have the 15th anniversary event then I'd expect 8.3 early/late December to early January.<br />
<br />
It's an option to jump into it or as others will do either take a break or play another game but it's there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People still play old games. Take a look at the remastered games that came out in the last 3 years. What about GOG? They're doing very well. The entire notion that Classic &quot;sux because old&quot; is rediculous. The classic super mario bros. aint shit just because it came out in 1985.<br />
<br />
Oh right nearly forgot! Usually people don't go to subforums for things they despise - might wanna look into that.</div></div><hr />

You just have to learn to filter out the trolls. Anyone saying BFA is better than classic right now either didn't play an expansion before WoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
People hating on BfA just shows the sheep/bandwagon/kids who are posting tbh. Sure, BfA hasn’t been the best but it’s been no where near as bad as WoD or Cata. It’s just a middle of the ground expansion. People jumped on the hating BfA bandwagon so early on though that now it’s honestly getting so old, and comparing it to Classic and saying it’s better is utterly ridiculous. Classic by no means was the best version of the game - the best version of the community i’d say though. Classic was severely flawed and severely bugged, but I’m glad that Blizzard and putting it out as it’s own experience because people (most of whom didn’t even play it) can see what an absolute shit show it is to play at times. I’m sure the “give TBC servers” (tbc being an actual terrible expansion) floodgates will open soon enough though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Any expansion is actually better than Classic. The game now is better, in a thousand ways. Probably not specifically the way you want it to be, but it is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going slightly OT of that but I honestly believe that is simply to be the case that it was 15 years ago rather than anything to do with the actual game as the attitude of people in general and especially the younger generation (to me) has changed dramatically irl and it shows throughout online expression too.</div></div><hr />

They will stay right? Cause I made 3 and I can't make additional characters for this &quot;new&quot; test. And I don't wan't to lose the names/characters I made.<br />
<br />
Closed Beta is only till Friday so like 3 days and it has a seperate client, sepretate servers. It's only available to those that were invited to the previous Beta and because it's short they won't invite any more people. You don't have to worry about your 3 characters, they are gona stay until you delete them, as I said Beta has different realms.</div></div><hr />

This whole &quot;Closed Beta&quot; is a joke, the sole reason it exists is to generate hype through streamers. Better call it streamer demo..</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the thing with retail is the leveling is tedious. Tedious in the sense that from the moment you create a brand new character until the moment you hit level 120, nothing in the world stands a chance against you. You are an absolute god with borderline cheat codes enabled just by existing. Level 10? Charge into 4 mobs and aoe them down in any spec on any class. Same thing at level 54 or 92 or 110.<br />
<br />
In classic leveling is tedious and much much much slower, but the reward and challenge makes that slog enjoyable. Reaching level 10 took hours, but those hours required me to pay attention and think about how many mobs I can potentially pull and survive, how much mana and HP Ive got, do I have pots if needed. Its still not HARD, but its at least engaging. <br />
<br />
I think that the concern with max level content is accurate, a large % of players will tire of the raids after a few runs because they have in fact done them a billion times before and the mechanics are farrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr easier to manage than todays game, but thats okay...why not just stop caring about who is playing what version and enjoy whatever youre doing?</div></div><hr />

Apparently, we're literally prevented from meeting people, having fun and feeling rewarded all at the same time. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
It's not that you're being prevented from (in this case), meeting people, it's that almost all organic demand to come together in grouped content is gone. There's no incentive from the player to ever talk to other people, or make any meaningful connection and the game has scaled back almost all of that over the years.<br />
<br />
You can stop and talk to people, but more often than not, you won't get anything out of the game for doing that, while in a classic environment, if you made friends with a mage, you now had a MAGE friend, which will net you a bunch of benefits. Now, don't get me wrong, people arent social because it nets them benefits, but it does create a feedback to in this case, mages that there is a meaningful thing to gain from social interaction with, and as a mage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to ask one question but 1st a note I did NOT play vanilla didn't even know the game existed tilll tbc, i didn't enjoy leveling there i found it over done tbh, i still find leveling boring today i enjoyed all of the expansions after that, baring that in mind is there any appeal for me to try classic other than the &quot;try it to see if you like it approach&quot; <br />
<br />
back to the topic seems they are trying to iron out so last minuet bugs that they want to make sure are gone be4 it goes live i wish the classic players would appreciate that as i wish they did that with retail. now with classic coming out i wish the classic players that want to<br />
stay in their game form the past will leave retail alone and stop trying to make it like classic</div></div><hr />

I don't know if this is true or not, but there's a stark difference in how BfA treats social interactions and how it organically occurs vs how classic does it, evidently a lot of people favour the latter over the former.</div></div><hr />

Nah, you made a new question that is much easier to answer.<br />
<br />
The reason Classic players are salty about BfA is because they're offered a choice between playing a game designed like Classic WoW - i.e. the kind of game they fell in love with - and letting go of 15 years of content.<br />
<br />
Classic players brought themselves into this situation, however, by rightly not trusting Blizzard to be able or willing to deliver a similar kind of experience for modern WoW, but it still sucks that Blizzard decided to repeatedly mess with WoW's core design pillars to the point where it essentially stopped being WoW, and therefore what they thought of as WoW was no longer playable.<br />
<br />
Glad to have been of assistance.<br />
<br />
The reason for why BfA players have a problem with Classic is a lot less clear... Are they afraid everybody's gonna switch to it? That would be a real shame, wouldn't it?</div></div><hr />

I think a lot of BfA players are unable to see the appeal of playing a 15y old game, with slow playstyle and no new content in sight.<br />
<br />
No one is angry that people choose to play something else - We are just stuck in an endless &quot;No U&quot;-argument. <br />

The open stress test only tested the starting areas. This test lets you create a geared level 40 so they can test out higher level content. I'm in it now and just created a character. They even give you 4 12-slot bags and a mount [Reins of the Striped Nightsaber]</div></div><hr />

It's actually perfectly clear. There are ppl who don't like BfA and there are ppl who love it. Then there is classic, there are ppl that just play it and there are ppl who feel the need to also shit on the current product. Before Classic those ppl had no attack surface but now they do.

<br />
I think it just feels that way because the &quot;streamers&quot; have such visibility. I'm sure Blizzard is not discounting the streamers, which give visibility to the content, but there's far more other people playing this that are not streamers. Also, I wouldn't be surprised if they do another open beta &quot;stress&quot; test before release. I would, if I were them. No reason not to give more people access to it, if nothing more than to test the load.</div></div><hr />

It's probably that. I bet they actually planned to slowly raise the lvl cap but interest really died down and they projected that there wouldn't be a rise in viewers if it just carried one. So they ended Beta and now after a cooldown period they restarted it.</div></div><hr />

The classic crowd aren't the ones acting super insecure and going off on insulting tangents; that is the BFA crowd on this site. WoW classic reddit, definitely has what you're saying, but on mmoc... it's heavily biased towards BFA and the BFA fans are SUPER toxic towards the pro classic crowd.<br />
<br />
The difference is... the BFA crowd attack the GAME in it's current state, which is 100% acceptable. the BFA crowd seems to insult the classic PLAYERS as much as the game, and that's not acceptable. IMO<br />

You shit on theirs.The cause of the frustration for Classic players is really, really simple. Blizzard changed classic WoW into retail WoW, which is in a completely different genre, causing a game like classic to become unavailable. This obviously upset them, and we saw what happened then. Now a significant portion of them are still upset, even if less so, because they are being told that they can choose between a 15 year old game and a game they don't like. Ideally, they want Classic WoW carried into the modern era.<br />
<br />
We're not parading around hating on people who like live, we're hating the gameplay design of live, just like they are Classic, but the difference is that Classic can be entirely ignored, whereas Classic cannot get new content for their favourite game that they pay a sub fee for, so they will pay for content updates for live without getting anything for themselves, which cannot be ignored.<br />
<br />
These people, myself included, won't stop moaning about this until we give up or Blizzard tweaks live just a little bit or we get a new server type that lets us do that. Classic+ would be great. Then it's reciprocal, and the moaning stops.<br />
<br />
But even then, you might as well get used to the idea that these two communities are irreconcilable. They are not playing the same game, and they don't want to, but the branding overlap is so massive that they think they are.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">justandulas</div><div class="date">2019-08-14, 12:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The cause of the frustration for Classic players is really, really simple. Blizzard changed classic WoW into retail WoW, which is in a completely different genre, causing a game like classic to become unavailable. This obviously upset them, and we saw what happened then. Now a significant portion of them are still upset, even if less so, because they are being told that they can choose between a 15 year old game and a game they don't like. Ideally, they want Classic WoW carried into the modern era.<br />

They have hinted at Classic+ several times, using OSRS as the example.<br />
<br />
The guy who's in charge of classic has repeatedly said he'd prefer a classic+ approach after it's all said and done, but that they are too far off from that atm and haven't decided between classic+ or TBC/WOTLK servers (easy money)</div></div><hr />

You must be blind, theres like nonstop whining about bfa from classic fanbois.<br />
<br />
Insulting BFA the game is fine, but insulting BFA players is not. Most classic players will insult BFA because the state of the game is not good in our eyes (IMHO, it's the worst wow expac ever. the only time i stopped playing, and if i wanted a diablo 3 mmo i'd be playing diablo 3)<br />
<br />
on the other hand, many of the pro BFA crowd are quick to lob insult grenades at classic PLAYERS and fans, and that's unnecessary on both sides.<br />
<br />
Some people prefer a wow that's more ARPG than MMO RPG. You legit spam buttons as fast as possible like playing Diablo3. <br />
<br />
Some of us prefer a WoW that's more traditional MMORPG over quick ARPG loot mechanics and systems. I'd prefer my wow be more EQ than D3<br />
<br />
to each their own, insult the game fine but there's no place for personal attacks</div></div><hr />

You are being pathetic. hermansen is completely correct with that statement. You're literally hating on people because of their personal preference in a video game.

The answer is no you're not. This is the mentality I don't understand with people like you. You're hating and down right toxic to people who think Classic will be better than retail for what ever reason.

There is no harm in having classic as an option attached to the regular sub, this will help keep subs steady in content droughts as people or even who guilds could go back and progress through old raids. And sure, many are looking forward to classic don't want to do retail, and that is fine too. Stop being cheap asses complaining about a sub fee when you are getting, in my opinion, the one thing pservers could never offer. Security for your stuff.

<br />
They put a lot of time and effort into a game that people are abandoning. No one in classic cares if you did a mythic +25, got Gladiator rank, or got the mount from a raid. They go from heroes to zeros. I'd be mad too. <br />
Not to mention, if classic is as popular as it seems, it WILL take resources away from retail, no matter what Blizzard says. I already see people demanding some of the newer BGs be ported into classic, and if Blizzard thinks theres money in it a few months down the line, they might very well go for it.</div></div><hr />

We don’t like Bfa, fine, but notice how we aren’t insulting bfa players just the game? Learn from that. Insult classic all you want but when you insult the players, you come off as a petulant little child insecure about bfa <br />
<br />
If you’re so secure in bfa, then you have no need to post here at all<br />

But your childish pouting reveals that classic is looming large for your guild, friends, and bfa as a whole <br />

It will have a huge technical debt, that they'll be fixing after release.<br />
It will be full of bugs 100%, the trick is to hide them all from users eyes.<br />
<br />
as an example:<br />
My boss wants me to release an app full of bugs with a few screens not working, cuz he promised his boss a set deadline and his boss promised to his boss... So i have to &quot;fake&quot; completeness, piss on quality of the code and just make everything look like it's working.<br />

When people say BFA is &quot;broken&quot; they are talking about the fundamentals ..

It's kinda funny because for years we've been told &quot;no one wants vanilla, learn to love modern WoW which is designed for players who don't like original WoW (lol)&quot;<br />

and now that we have vanilla returning; there's nothing but bitterness and anger from some loyalists towards retail and it comes across as the most insecurity i can remember in gaming.<br />

<br />
Firstly ashmongold nor any of the streamers are in this thread spewing their toxic shit. I'm not denying a good majority of people on classic have been hating - contradicting - being elitest - or the fucking term I hate purist. What I am seeing in this thread is you being toxic to everyone. People have stated their opinion on why they think X and you've pounced on them. When you've given any sort of justification it was;<br />
<br />
<br />
Not nearly as pathetic as the insane amounts of delusion that permeates the minds of Classic fanboys who think that outdated trash is still good in 2019.<br />
<br />
So now you've admitted to literally taking your shit out on people because of their personal preferences and what other people (streamers) have said in the past. <br />
<br />
Yes some classic fans like I said are toxic with retail, but that works both ways. As you're proving yourself right now. As for attacking modern games? Are you high? There's literally weekly posts of people bashing CoD, Destiny etc. for literally just being on the launcher, let alone anything else. <br />
<br />
And lastly, I did tell you I have a problem. I called you pathetic. Which you are, also it's you who is the hypocrite not us. I don't give a flying fuck if you prefer retail, classic or a modded private server playing as the master chief with Thomos the train mount. You're being toxic for the sake of being toxic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sensa1</div><div class="date">2019-08-14, 03:39 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That statement is a bit of an Oxymoron, coming from a Classic fantard.<br />
<br />
We get it you don't like Classic and/or Classic Fanboys. But guess what? There was absolutely no reason for you to comment in this thread to begin with because it was news about a version of the game you don't like to begin with so it really doesn't concern you. But no, instead of taking the high road and ignoring the thread completely, you purposefully came to this thread to crap on Classic. The toxic back and forth was entirely predictable and probably what you wanted to occur. <br />
<br />
I don't comment on Retail WoW news / threads that don't pertain to me. You want to know why? I won't be playing Retail despite having access to the game from my subscription. <br />
<br />
Over and above your completely toxic childish behaviour the real reason you should just grow up and stop crapping on Classic at every opportunity is that Classic may benefit Retail in a variety of ways:<br />
<br />
1) during content droughts in Retail instead of your friends and guild mates unsubscribing for months on end they may stay subscribed and casually dabble in Classic by levelling a few toons. That's a fairly likely scenario for a lot of players and actually part and parcel of the reason Blizzard decided to do Classic. And even if you. personally, don't want to dabble in Classic during Retail content droughts the fact that many might means they are also more likely to be around to dabble in Retail and continue to do dailies or even raids once a week, while dabbling in Classic helping to keep your server/version off the game alive. That's a win for Retail.<br />
<br />
2) the Retail Classic dabblers and returning players like myself who will only play Classic will be contributing to significantly higher revenues for Blizzard. Since Classic has minimal development costs some of those extra revenues may be put back into Retail which would be a win for Retail players.<br />
<br />
3) Blizzard, depending on a variety off factors, might introduce some elements of Classic gameplay to Retail to broaden it's appeal and/or make it a better game which might be enough to attract players like myself back to Retail. Again, this is another potential win for Retail.<br />
<br />
So, there are 3 possible wins for Retail. Logic would dictate the Retailers should be happy to let the Classic Fanboys have their little playground back because in most scenario's Retail benefits from having Classic around. <br />
<br />
So grow up, be happy for us, and play the game you prefer.</div></div><hr />

There are ppl who don't like BfA and there are ppl who love it. Then there is classic, there are ppl that just play it and there are ppl who feel the need to also shit on the current product. Before Classic those ppl had no attack surface but now they do. And what do you do if you are offended by a person who shits on your beliefs? You shit on theirs.<br />

100% false. Private servers have been a thing, with up to 100k active accounts collectively ...Claiming that before papa blizz released vanilla there was on contention is asinine and you CLEARLY dont follow the game.<br />
<br />
The biggest SPIKE was when WOD came out. Some people left in cata and MOP but the classic servers BLEW UP when Wod came out.<br />
<br />
That was the true changing of a guard at Blizz.</div></div><hr />

Which makes sense because the middle of WoD is when Jay Wilson and the Diablo 3 team were moved to WoW... and since then, we've seen the complete Diablo-ification of WoW<br />
<br />
It isn't even the same game as vanilla, hell i barely consider them the same genre personally.<br />
<br />
One is a traditional MMORPG, one is an MMO ARPG similar to Diablo 3 with other players</div></div><hr />

<br />
I express the same sentiments to you, dipshit.<br />
<br />
<br />
When people say BFA is &quot;broken&quot; they are talking about the fundamentals .. The fundamentals of classic wow ARE in tact....thats the point..maybe when your over the age of 16 you will understand this concept, until then enjoy your 45 min BFA session followed by 6 ours of tugging on boys dicks playing fortnite.<br />
<br />
Gotta love the irony when someone with the grammatical competence of a preschooler calls me a 16 year old.<br />
Maybe you wouldn't have flunked school if you spent more time studying and less time playing games.</div></div><hr />

Their agendas being fueled by toxic Youtubers/Streamers like HeelvsBabyface and Asmongold who make clout by constantly shit talking Retail and its playerbase. So don't tell me that I'm the one being pathetic, you flaming hypocrite!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Of course I do. But I also don't have to pay $15 a month in order to play them. It's not my fault that you are too stupid to see you're being ripped off.<br />
Sure, you also gain access to Retail with the subscription. But the Classic Zealots have expressed quite often they have no intention of going back to it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure those oldschool gamers don't attack modern gamers nearly as much as the Classic fanbase have. And as Nnyco said. &quot;You must be blind, There's like nonstop whining about BFA from classic fanbois.&quot; But of course. Your heads are still stuck all the way back in 2004, so you haven't noticed.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When the Classic fans stop being toxic about retail, I'll back off. You only have yourselves to blame for this backlash.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Rotted and justandulas. If you've got a problem with me then say it TO me instead of circlejerking each other like a bunch of pathetic cucks!<br />
<br />
Bro<br />
<br />
Are you fucking 11 years old.<br />
<br />
A few retarded points to cover.<br />
<br />
Paying 15$ for 2 games, when YOU pay 15 bucks for 1 game is a ripe off? okay you are mentally handicapped since you cant do the math on those gains .<br />
<br />
Asmon can be cringe , an as far as i know AZ talks about how Warcraft lost the journey and is a tab collection game ( Prove me wrong ) <br />
<br />
Basing your opinion on something based on who hates/likes it is ALSO a mental handicap . <br />
<br />
Are you American? because 75% of the world hates your country ...but i bet you dont hate it..<br />
<br />
Id be careful with who you call a hypocrite...because your epidermis is showing BAD.<br />
<br />
NEXT POINT stop saying toxic....its over used and people like you devalue the meaning of TOXIC in correlation to Criticism . Its like how the word RACIST is losing its value because if you dont say HI to a Native American woman as she passes you RACIST..<br />
<br />
Thats what you sound like kid.<br />
<br />
Retail is flawed....the NUMBERS fucking show it..yet you want to call the people who want the NUMERICALLY better product to fuck off? <br />
<br />
Jesus Christ your intellectual dishonest is telling..Enjoy living alone in BFA i might see you for 9.0 when the devs stop fucking up the product that USED to be good.<br />

<br />
The guy who's in charge of classic has repeatedly said he'd prefer a classic+ approach after it's all said and done, but that they are too far off from that atm and haven't decided between classic+ or TBC/WOTLK servers (easy money)<br />
<br />
Do you have a source on that? I might be wrong but I seem to recall the opposite, that there are no plans for Classic+ and that it is unlikely, while TBC/WotLK is a strong possibility depending on Classic's reception.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are undecided and said during a PC gamer interview i believe (i'll try and edit in the link for u, ill hunt it down after i post) that they are undecided between Classic+ and TBC/Wotlk servers and that both are on the table and dependent upon wow classic's success. (EDIT: Kolvarg https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2019-07-29-a-big-wow-classic-interview-in-the-lead-up-to-launch)<br />
<br />
it could still go either way at this point. The cheap thing to do would be tbc/wotlk servers and i'd expect that if classic bombs, but if classic does unexpectedly well (it will) then i won't be shocked if they take the classic+ approach.<br />
<br />
At this point, they are undecided so there's nothing concrete one way or the other yet. They are still kinda in wait and see mode with both options (Classic+ and tbc/wotlk servers) being considered.</div></div><hr />

People like dark dont understand the FUNDAMENTAL difference between classic and Retail . HE just wants to make a straw man of my points and focus on a spelling issue or something, rather than rebuddle the argument .<br />
<br />
if this was between classic and legion i feel LEGION was a better game than BFA. While i enjoy classic for the journey, grind, and an actual BEST IN SLOT LIST. I see the merits of systems like legion. BUT BFA screwed it up and everything is a random number generator activity . Thats not for me.<br />
<br />
I tried to point out if we look at the data on sub counts, CLEARLY BFA and WOD are not the most popular versions. yet people like dark say that if you CRITICIZES his love, you are being Toxic.<br />
<br />
Literally the mentality of a man child who lives with his parents.<br />

Legion was 10x the game BFA is. Legion was about as good as Diablo-WoW can get, IMHO. BFA was never going to match Legion's quality, but i didn't think it would make me long for the days of WoD either lol.<br />
<br />
I feel bad for dark tbh. he is either a child, or someone who's fundamentally mentally insecure about BFA's future vs classic that he has to rage and troll constantly to make him feel better about BFA. Almost like someone trying to convince themselves they like something.<br />
<br />
BFA is almost designed for people who dislike vanilla-wotlk era WoW, and that's fine... if someone likes diablo wow more power to them, but it isn't for me and i prefer my WoW to have that vanilla flavor where progression MEANT something. Where we played more than &quot;just the patch&quot;. Where each patch didn't bring a new &quot;season&quot; where every bit of expac content prior (including the raids) are made insignificant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For anyone wondering , he was the post i got reported for..notice the LACK of physical violence and attacking a person arguement here <br />
<br />
<br />
- You are an idiot if you dont understand the PHYSICS of flying in a 3 dimensional space, vs traveling in 2 dimensions. Content boring and bland? it wasnt(nor should it be) designed for you to start quest - fly to top of skybox-fly STRAIGHT LINE WITH NO OBSTACLE IN YOUR PATH- land move in a 10 yard radius - and fly back to the top<br />
<br />
<br />
Send me your email so i can send you 2 videos. 1 of land travel - Vanilla, the other flight travel - End of WoTLK.<br />
<br />
IF you dont see the difference in barrenness you are a lost cause.<br />
<br />
This is the most stupid statement i have EVER seen and im in the pro flying camp. But i still understand you no longer see 40+ people riding across the landscape...why, ,because there is no need to travel in a group ( PVP server) or on land ( flying) The only place with a population is a PVP hub or capital city. At the start of legion u could go to any random zone and see alot of people. Which literally puts the WORLD in to warcraft...<br />
<br />
Get the fuck outta here <br />
<br />
Try again with your fail logic. Put the bible down and look at numbers, you are mathematically incorrect<br />
<br />
Go play Aion if thats the game you want. WoW clearly is not for you.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
was a being a dick...yes....is that a crime...no....is threatening someone with physical harm a crime...yes....MMO-Champion SUPPORTS Crime.<br />
