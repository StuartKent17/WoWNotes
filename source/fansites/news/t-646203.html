In the next few days we’ll be releasing a minor bug fix patch to version 3.1.1. This sort of patch is very small in size, and we use them to fix specific issues that can’t be hot-fixed. Most patches require a lengthy testing procedure before release, but because this change is focused solely on a client tooltip, its testing process can be accelerated to resolve the issue as soon as possible.<br />
<br />
In 3.1.1, the paladin ability Exorcism cannot damage other players, but the player game client does not display this change properly. Patch 3.1.1a will fix the tooltip to display the appropriate text; it also displays an error message when a player tries to use it against other players.<br />
<br />
While we have not done many minor bug fix patches to date, we do plan to use them as appropriate in the future to resolve smaller issues rapidly, rather than waiting for a full patch. <br />
<br />
Just as an update. We will be releasing the minor bug fix patch 3.1.1a during tonight’s maintenance period. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Not a lot of activity from blue posters lately ... It definitely looks like developers are busy fixing stuff left and right. <br />
Noblegarden (See the guide (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=52100.0))<br />
Hard Boiled (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=2416)<br />
So you just need to find another player with the stick to head down to Un'goro so you can cast it on each other and both get the achievement. You could also just head down during a busy time of the night and look around for people - I'm sure there are a number of other people down there who won't mind cast a branch on someone. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/20/16474334222-regarding-the-noble-title.html))<br />
<br />
Shake your Bunny-Maker (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?achievement=2422)<br />
It may be hard to track down certain individuals, but that is why the event isn't just one day anymore and you have all week to find them. I noticed some of these particular gender/race combinations happily enjoying their time in the spotlight outside a bank and clicking off the ears every time they popped to help out as many people as possible. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/16474154504-shake-you-bunnymaker.html))<br />
<br />
Too many people doing the Noblegarden achievements<br />
Don't forget that you have the rest of the week to complete these achievements. If it was super easy to get eggs then that takes away from it being an egg &quot;hunt&quot;. Overall I've seen a lot of players completing everything for this rather quickly so it doesn't seem out of reach at all.

Reasoning behind the Exorcism nerf?<br />
I say &quot;we think&quot; and &quot;we feel&quot; a lot because there is no machine that you plug data into that returns which abilities or specs are OP or not. There are humans making these decisions and I freely admit that it is largely a subjective call. That doesn't mean we make decisions randomly or without evidence, but it does mean that you aren't always going to be able to &quot;prove&quot; that X is overpowered or Y is underpowered. It's all pretty relative and subject to the way that the designers want the game to work.<br />
<br />
We don't generally provide numbers to justify our claims because we are the ones empowered to make the changes. This is not the same thing as the data not existing. We do ask players for numbers when they make claims that we should change something. When you are asking us to change our minds, you have to offer some evidence why we should.<br />
<br />
All of this is really begging the point though because we have answered pretty clearly why we nerfed Exorcism. It sounds like you just don't like those answers. (Which is fine, because as I admitted, it's subjective.)<br />
<br />
Many players would disagree with you that Retribution is underpowered at the moment, and a lot of players would argue that the spec needs more nerfs. When a lot of players disagree with something that you offer as blindingly obvious, you should at least stop to ask yourself why it is not blindingly obvious to them. Sure they could just hate your spec and want to see you fail. That is one explanation. It isn't always the only explanation.

Reflective shields and fast attacking classes<br />
Reflective shields being so much stronger versus fast-attacking targets is something we would like to address. It's fine that it's a good defense against them generally speaking, but it has become a little too extreme where you can blow yourself up against something that was designed to be more of a small bonus, not a hard counter.<br />
<br />
We're not sure a ppm (proc per minute) implementation is the right way to go in this case, because that might be too generous to the fast attackers, making it too easy for them to just disregard the fact that there is a shield. But there is probably something in between we could come up with.<br />
<br />
Please don't respond with &quot;I CANT BELIEVES THEY'RE BUFFING ROGUES.&quot; It's still a problem, even if it affects a class that is currently doing quite well in PvP. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/16473973884-one-small-pvp-change-id-love.html))<br />

100 per 90 minutes? I had 100 in 30, just find a town where it's not that busy and make sure you look everywhere. Every barrel, under every couch, cart or table. I've seen people walk in front of me and miss 3 eggs after eachother because they just didn't look in those harder to find spots.

Lol, this is one thing I can easily believe. Rogue is THE PVP class of Blizzard. In TBC restodruids where everywhere and paladins suck in any form - but rogue were Ok. In WoTLK palas and dk were dominating, but they have made all their best to get rogue back to top quite fast - and rogue &quot;currently doing quite well in PvP&quot; - which means purely dominating with priests at every spot. <br />
That's very funny to see those two class comments one after another. &quot;a lot of players would argue that the spec needs more nerfs&quot; - sure thing, I even have couple of ideas:<br />
1) your healing spells cannot be cast on yourself, if you have PVP on<br />
2) your hammer of wrath cannot be cast on enemy players<br />
Go ahead, Blizzard, nerf palas more. <br />
And, as a matter of fact, probably &quot;some players&quot; things retri palas need nerf, but *all* players I was talking to but rogues and priests thinks rogues need to be &quot;doing in pvp&quot; not THAT well. But I bet, there will be no rogue nerf. There will be more pala nerf. <br />
Seriously, if you want to PVP in WoW - roll rogue. This is THE PvP spec - from time to time Blizzard would buff something to follow up with continious half a year nerf, but rogues will always be Ok.</div></div><hr />

Would be OK if the nerfs they did to suport the use of exorcism reverted back too when fighting another player.<br />

Yeah of course, going offline in wow at midnight makes you a kiddy, I knew! It's not like I have to get up at half past 6 in the morning and work 9 hours a day and therefore I go offline before midnight. No I go offline because I am a kiddy.<br />

To be honest, this is probably the easiest meta there is.. You sit in one zone for an hour, then travel to like 5 places and you're done. Atleast we didn't have to go all over like for valenties.. etc....</div></div><hr />

<br />
And this isn't even very game-breaking or difficult to do. <br />
<br />
I, and most likely the rest of the rogue community, would thoroughly appreciate it if reflective damage such as thorns, Retribution aura, and damage shield would be normalized, or at least have a short internal CD per attacker (like 2 seconds or something, even with increased damage if such a CD was implemented) <br />
<br />
Just in case I'm not clear, here's some arbitrary numbers: I hit a target about 15 times in 8 seconds, I deal 6000 damage and take 3750 damage. A class with a 2-hander hits the same target about 4-5 times in 8 seconds, dealing 6000 damage and taking 1000 damage. <br />
<br />
I'm not saying the damage from these attacks is &quot;too much&quot; or anything, and I don't want anyone to think I want these skills to be nerfed in the total damage they're capable of against enemies on average. <br />
<br />
I just don't like how these kinds of buffs/auras hurt rogues more than any other class due to how many auto attacks we throw out over the course of a fight. It can be very frustrating to fight an opponent and deal as much as 50% of my total health to myself. They deal much more damage to an attacker based on the number of times they hit, which for rogues, is a lot more than most classes (perhaps even every class).<br />
<br />
In response, all I can say is...<br />
<br />
Really?....Really?...Are you serious?<br />
Rogues are owning in arenas, in fact they have always been viable in arenas to one degree or another. Most of the classes with reflective shields that were listed have not always been viable in arenas in the spec necessary for getting access to the reflective shield in question. <br />
<br />
Two classes mentioned, Warrior and Priest, have reflective shielding properties that have to be talented, for priest it means a heavy investment in the Disc tree, and for Warriors it means they are prot. Warriors wear plate, and 99 times out of 100 they get sapped and or CC'd right off the bat to force them into either trinketing or waiting out the CC, either way a prot warrior in arenas is reduced to nothing more than a harassment tool against opposing teams casters. Priests have always gotten owned by rogues, and rogues almost always try to eliminate their easiest target first to finish the fight fast (scratch that, if the rogue isn't terribad he/she will ALWAYS kill a priest first).<br />
<br />
The reflective shield damage is the deterrant to this happening. If not for that shield the priest in question mounts virtually no offense (even though its a defensive mechanism) on a rogue. I am of the opinion that a reflective shield should not be handled with a nerf to the shield or a CD being placed on the damage, but it should fall on the responsibility of your teams healer instead. Healing has almost been deprioritized away from arenas in all but 5's at this point, in favor of higher burst damage capability. Twos and Threes is a dps race, the reflective shield makes you think about your strat instead of a rogue just saying &quot;Priest...KILL!!!&quot;</div></div><hr />

The problem is that it's hitting people for using one hand weapons faster than those that would use a two hand weapon. This isn't a rogue-specific issue. It also affects, to a lesser degree, hunters, warriors, and deathknights if they so choose to use one-handed weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you ever played vs a team consisting of retibution paladin and a healdruid as a rogue ? For every hit i land i get around 500-600 dmg thrown back in my face... which is more than most of the auto attacks do on a druid in tree form btw. It seriously isnt funny just dying to dmg reflects in a matter of 30-40 seconds without even taking any dmg from any other source.<br />
<br />
Dont even get me started on what happens if i decide to hit the retibution paladin as then it wont only be ret aura+thorns but eye for an eye as well (20% dmg reflect on all critical hits). This is just insane and as mentioned before just not a fun or good game design.<br />

<br />
I understand and respect where the poster is coming from regarding his reasoning behind nerfs in general even if I disagree and wonder why retribution has been the whipping boy for years. Despite this, I understand the thinking behind why they nerf.<br />
<br />
The problem I have is not with the nerfs themselves, it is the collateral damage they have caused. When something is nerfed purely for pvp, sometimes pve suffers badly. Or a nerf meant for one spec really hurts others. This collateral damage is the worst problem. <br />
<br />
I am not sure if it was intentional to take away shockadin at release of wrath with the judgement of righteousness nerf or not, but the exorcism change brought it back in full force and for people like me who loved the spec for its pure fun and versatility factor (even though it was not a viable dps or even pure healing class). <br />
<br />
Then the exorcism change to nerf ret, had its hardest effect on a class it wasn't intended to nerf in the first place. <br />
<br />
Sounding like a broken record on this I am sure, But I propose two simple solutions that could be hotfixed as fast as exorcism was ninja stealth nerfed. Change purifying power to allow a player to use exorcism on a player instead of decreaing mana cost of certain holy spells. That way ret dosen't have it but shockadin remains. Or simply bring back judgement of righteousness to its previous BC form, ret never uses righteousness anyway. Both solutiojns are simple, hit the correct target (ret) and mitigate the collateral damage impact.<br />
<br />
Again, it isn't ret nerfs that concerns me, it is how such simple ideas and thoughts can stop such collateral damage and they are totally ignored. Shockadin was just used as an example.</div></div><hr />
