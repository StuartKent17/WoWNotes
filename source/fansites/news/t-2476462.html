Patch 8.2 Features<br />
<br />
There are no new Allied Races in Patch 8.2. The team will add more where it makes sense, and entirely new races (non allied races) are still better added in expansions rather than content updates.<br />
Mechagon is smaller than Nazjatar, but still has a lot of content. It is slightly larger than the Timeless Isle.<br />
<br />
Story in Rise of Azshara<br />
<br />
Azshara has plans and has a role to play in the faction conflict. There are events that the players will not expect.<br />
We have just come off of a major battle between the factions, and so the faction conflict will continue for the foreseeable future.<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
The team wants to see more class representation in Mythic + and the MDI and will consider this when adding affixes in the future.<br />
There are no plans to add a fourth spec option to existing classes in the near future. Another spec would add a lot more complications to someone learning the game.<br />
In the future the team wants to make the existing specs more distinct from each other, with noticeable strengths and weaknesses.<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
<br />
There could be more bot AI brawls in the future as seen with Comp Stomp.<br />
It would be hard to imagine a WoW 2.0 not in Azeroth, however, the team can change the world drastically such as adding the sword in Silithus.<br />
<br />
Development<br />
<br />
Ion admits that one of the flaws of BfA's start was the fact that all the new features did not blend together in a cohesive manner. For example, the Order Halls of Legion were directly tied into the story and your Artifact Weapon, whereas this is not the case in the latest expansion.<br />
The team continues to read and value player feedback. They read almost everything, but also realize that not all players are on social media.<br />
Players often feel like silence means that the team is not listening. This is not the case. They actively discuss a lot of the topics presented on the forums, but don't want to announce changes until they are certain it is the right direction and considers the wider audiences. A good example of this is the problems of Warforging/Titanforging. The team actively discusses it, but want to find a satisfying solution for all audiences.<br />
They are reluctant to implement systems for leveling used in Guild Wars because leveling up and character progression/strength is a core experience for RPGs.<br />
They definitely want to get to a place where every level up means something again.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quartermaster's Bounty and Warlord's Trophy<br />
Is there any word on the fix to the reward for this quest? The breakdown of the Season 2 Rewards advertised that the quest would reward a Warlord’s Trophy, not the Battleborn Sigil that it is now. It would be nice for the reward to be updated to reflect what was advertised, given there are many out there that burned Bonus Rolls just to accelerate the process of acquiring it, and that there is even less control over PvP gear than there is PvE gear.<br />
We apologize for the confusion on this. The intent was for the reward to be a Battleborn Sigil when you turn in the 10 Quartermaster’s Coins, but we had it listed wrong in the Season 2 blog post. The blog has been updated and I wanted to confirm that the Battleborn Sigil reward is correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean a fun one that has events included while levelling? And if character strength was a core thing then you wouldn't have this bs scaling tech. Must be tough having to admit that there is competition with more fun levelling eh Ion?</div></div><hr />

How could anyone, in their right mind, think that the reward for investment (regarding the Battleborn Sigil) is anything close to acceptable? What a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because RPG elements are worth SO much to them. Totally reasonable approach. Let's make the whole game soloable and remove every sort of long-lasting character progression every other month, good idea - but touching leveling is where you HAVE TO respect RPG features at all costs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I should have been more clear. I like basically everything else about WoW. The classes, the questing, the world, the feel, even the UI and supporting systems. I just don't know who still gets excited about gear drops these days. Wouldn't world first races be cooler if everyone started on an equal footing? I don't know... I just can't get excited about gear any more. It just feels like a chore after 14 years?<br />
<br />
I understand this might be a less popular opinion. But I feel like there 9873948543 different ways to make this feel like a meaningful RPG without just adding levels and adding item levels. There's comes a point where I don't really need to feel like I am still &quot;gaining power&quot; ... it's just silly! Let me customize my character more (better talent trees and horizontal progression; as well as cosmetics) and worry about keeping up with the Joneses less. Just my opinion. :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see your point. It might feel that we never get anything &quot;new&quot; since the recipe for each xpac is pretty much the same. Its new zones, quests etc, but more or less the same thing. For Blizzard to do the changes you talk about, it would require alot from them. Also, theres alot of people that dont like the way gw2 plays, dont forget that(I liked it btw).<br />
<br />
I have just realised wow is not supposed to be played alot like in the &quot;old days&quot;, probably for the best for me personally lol. So I just unsub from time to time and come back weeks or months later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, but there is no reason to have the cap raise every expansion since mobs scale artificially now and can just be made slightly harder in newer content, it is just a time gate in general to have a level cap considered progression.<br />
<br />
I was just saying artifact weapons themselves as a concept is better than leveling, they literally had an alternate solution to character progression that was not connected to leveling, but decided that keeping leveling in was a good idea even though it is super arbitrary when you don't get new talents or spells connected to it.</div></div><hr />

So isn't that patch with the most world content so far?<br />

Depending on how the content gets staggered, it might remain so. Since Blizz is allergic to putting a raid and a dungeon into a single patch, I can't see them adding a both Mechadon and Nazjatar into a single update.</div></div><hr />

Agreed. All these new races, best thing to do would bring out new specs. Cause making a 5th Arcane Mage or 8th WW Monk just doesn't seem that interesting</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm still not on board with this philosophy. Specs don't need to be classes in themselves. Let me finish off a target with a quick fire blast as a frost mage, or throw up some dots while on the move as a destro lock. I much preferred when classes had access to 99% of their class abilities and specs just made one section of them stronger, of course with a few big spec specific abilities. Strengths and weaknesses is also hard to actually nail down. I'd argue MoP was the expansion where classes were the most well rounded at everything and I loved it. If we have to choose between good aoe or good ST, then that's a really unfun choice to make because the game is designed around doing both, and I'd rather the distinguishing factor be who did their rotation better than who kept swapping talents. If the weakness of a class/spec is that it's slow and easily locked down, it's hard (for me) to ever have fun playing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know where people got the idea that every patch would have new allied races.<br />
<br />
I think there were a few things. There is a perception that Allied Races are not new races and therefore are easier to implement ... and since they are easier, they should just add as many as possible.<br />
<br />
There is also that &quot;ArtOffLoop&quot; animation that had been datamind that led to a lot of sites basically confirming certain races as the next to be added. This definitely fueled the fire.<br />
<br />
Finally, during Blizzcon there was a &quot;What's Next&quot; section and slide dedicated to just mechagnomes. Even now that seems like a weird to present that information unless they would be a playable race. I mean... every patch adds new creatures... but they never get a page dedicated to them like that. bad move by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Well, it's nice of him to admit that, but i don't recall anyone complaining that the new features didn't &quot;blend&quot; - the complaint is that the new features stank on ice. <br />

He's been saying this so long, but he and &quot;the team&quot; don't have enough credibility for anyone to listen. <br />

<br />
Players often feel like silence means that the team is not listening. This is not the case.

A good example of this is the problems of Warforging/Titanforging. The team actively discusses it, but want to find a satisfying solution for all audiences.<br />
<br />
Players want feedback too, Ion. You don't have to announce sweeping revamps only, you can get on social media and at the very, bare minimum acknowledge that you and &quot;the team&quot; are aware of the issue and are discussing it. That goes a long way towards quelling riots and tantrums, and it's astounding to me a person in your position, with your YEARS of experience dealing with your customer base, you don't get that, or refuse to get it, or pretend not to.<br />

And, they want things to HAPPEN, which a lot of the time, doesn't happen. You and &quot;the team&quot; have taught players that the only way to get changes or even just a fucking acknowledgement that there's an issue is to throw temper tantrums. Treat people like children, don't complain when they ACT like children. You have forums. You have social media. You pay slobby slackers with awful poodle hair treatments to &quot;manage&quot; the community. FUCKING USE THEM. And use them for more than slouching in a chair telling players they're wrong. <br />
<br />
You keep prattling on and on and on and on about &quot;doing better&quot;, and &quot;communication&quot;, and &quot;discussion&quot;, but...nothing changes. And, you keep making the same fucking boneheaded mistakes, or you dig your heels in and turtle on dumb issues. <br />
<br />
More and more, I feel like these puffball interviews and Q&amp;As are just for feeding your ego, so you can slouch in a chair and ramble on and on, navel gazing at great length about the subtle challenges and nuances of game design, while enjoying the smell of your own farts. I don't get any feeling that you have any interest in real, effective and meaningful discussions or communication with your customers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depending on how the content gets staggered, it might remain so. Since Blizz is allergic to putting a raid and a dungeon into a single patch, I can't see them adding a both Mechadon and Nazjatar into a single update.<br />
<br />
Blizzard must have found their anti-allergen medicine, then, as both Patch 7.2 and 7.3 had a dungeon and a raid in them.</div></div><hr />

Mechagnomes would probably still fall into allied race territory for 8.3. Unfortunately. <br />

<br />
Level cap is just an excuse to keep the game time gated to a minor extent.<br />
<br />
A level increase is needed to reset your stats every once in a while.<br />
<br />
If they keep the game on the same level cap, your secondary stats would just hit ridiculous numbers after a while. And that's not good from a balance perspective.</div></div><hr />

That's ridiculous. They can and do reset stats whenever they feel like it. They just hide it now with their idiotic behind the scenes black box ilvl scaling.<br />
<br />
They could do it out in the open at the start of an expac. They like levelling because it's time consuming, easy to make, and serves the portion of the playerbase that for whatever reason finds the &quot;story&quot; during the questing experience to be entertaining.</div></div><hr />

This too makes no sense as either a race is allied to the horde or alliance or not and really wouldn't depend on how much they like any one member of either side.. but eh, making sense doesn't matter as long as they are grabbing up player time with cosmetic nonsense.<br />

Dark Iron dwarves, Kul Tiran humans, Light forged Draenei are called &quot;allied race&quot;, because they are a sub-race of dwarf, human and draenei? <br />
Then why is void elf an allied race? it is a sub-race of high elf? but high elf is not even a playable race. Why isn't void elf a &quot;totally new race&quot;?<br />
<br />
The definition of an allied race is generally a race that's a reskin of an existing race. Every new race that has been added (Blood Elves, Draenai, Worgen, Goblins, Pandarens) used completely new models and animation rigs. All of the allied races, with the exception of the Zandalari and Kul Tiran, have used the same model and rig as an existing race. Nightborne use the Night Elf model, Void Elves use the Blood Elf model, Maghar use the Orc model, Dark Iron use the Dwarf model. Even the Zandalari and Kul Tiran reuse a *lot* of the animations from the Troll and Human models, respectively.<br />
<br />
The reason this is important is because allied races take substantially less of a time investment from the art and animation teams, which means they are far more practical to implement on a patch-level timetable. Entirely new races take an order of magnitude more investment by the creative-types, and thus are only really practical when implemented on an expansion scale. The alternative, if they implemented them in point patches, would be sacrificing art time investment in new zones, dungeons, and raids, which means less of that content released. So would you rather have a new full race, or an allied race and an extra continent in the content patch?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not if you contestualize it in 2004-2005. First of all remove the concept where only raiding matters, then consider for a moment all possible and perfectly viable builds useful in world content, dungeons and pvp. Then add a pinch of my hyperbole, served on a platter and you got it right ;)<br />
<br />
Forced into roles was an heritage, not positive one, mostly corrected by TBC onwards, with its peak in WotLK (probably). What's missing today, in my opinion, is that player ingenuity is not encouraged, but removed from the game, bit by bit, until total omogenization is the only thing you can get: tank, healer, melee, ranged. 4 classes with different particle effects.<br />
Gone are the days of hunter pet tanking (not heroic raiding, but in normal on some fights? Yeah), dps with backup healing role, and many other things. Everything has an enrage timer, so a few survivors can't bring home a fight if half the raid does something stupid (Heigan dance is the first thing coming to my mind).<br />
<br />
I'm not saying &quot;vanilla was better&quot;, because they are two different games in almost every aspect, what I'm saying is that modern WoW has too many things done wrongly, badly, etc.</div></div><hr />

Vanilla had shit class design. Spamming a single ability and being forced into certain roles. There were no real options that you speak of.Design concept was excellent, problem is that it was just a frame, the dawn, still not enough decorated/formed idea. As for roles, problem as a whole is less directly in classes design, but much more in flaw of &quot;role&quot; items = stats and characteristics + encounters design had limitations due to technical issues. Ie classes design wasn't main problem in this case, and if you still haven’t enlightened it after all these (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2462079-If-Blizzard-had-reverted-to-the-old-talent-system?p=50744025&amp;viewfull=1#post50744025) discussions (not without my participation), then I sincerely feel sorry for you.<br />
<br />
You still forget that system is much larger (https://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/2476128-Class-design-was-best-during?p=51037737#post51037737) than just &quot;class design&quot; and very sensitive to any changes in it, since its elements are dependent on each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
do you know what the alterrnative is to unique classes with more class focus then spec? You gonna only play restro because the other two gonna suck.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is a reason why other mmos doesnt have specs the way wow does, was a big mistake from the beginning. Especially the ones with multiple roles</div></div><hr />

Pretty much.<br />
<br />
It's a shame because if they brought back stats like Dodge, Parry, Armor Penetration and a few others (NOT HIT) then Reforging could be quite useful.<br />
<br />
Only really stopped being useful because they ended up dumbing the game down to 4 stats.<br />
<br />
As for Titanforging. RNG has no place in the quality of gear. Even ESO with gear upgrades lets you basically have a 100% chance if you gather enough of the easy to obtain upgrade materials (Epic to Legendary requires a bit of work though). But with ESO you can still CHOOSE to take that chance or spend a little extra time to guarantee the quality upgrade. <br />
<br />
Something WoW should take lessons from imo.</div></div><hr />

Reforging was literally THE best thing that they gave us to have a little more control over our gear, it was flawless and perfect.. but that would lead players to obtain their desired gear alot faster / obtain any random item and then reforge that item to replicate stats to their desired gear which would lead players to &quot;not have a reason to keep playing&quot;. I understand this move from a marketing standpoint, make the reward system more casual friendly with more rng in it... but they're hurting good chunk of core players with this system, by &quot;core&quot; i mean not casuals who don't just jump around from mmo to mmo when one gets boring, but hey.. they're looking at their &quot;DATA&quot; and casual player % is much higher than semi-hardcore / hardcore player % so they're doing everything to please casuals, again, totally understandable from marking standpoint, but you'd just never expect blizzard to get that cheap<br />

I'll only speak for myself, but previously one of my biggest motivations to do well in logs was to compete with other players who played the same class, at the end of a raidtier we would all have almost exactly the same gear and we would have almost perfectly balanced environment to compete with each-other.. now? once you're above certain skill level ( which they dumbed the skill-ceiling down for every single class btw ) the performance only depends on how lucky you are with the procs ( thanks to azerite garbage ) and how lucky you've been with tf gear.<br />
This is a subjective point of view, i get that.. but removing TF or adding a cap to it and reimplementing reforing to the game literally won't hurt anybody, but please alot of players who are competitive</div></div><hr />

how does reforging allow played to obtain their desired gear alot faster?<br />
all it does is allow players to take random peices and go &quot;eh i will reforge it to be better&quot;<br />
<br />
also idk if you know but reforging was super minor, like... really minor, the literal only reason it was there was to optimize hit/expertise, but it did work for other stats, the amount of stats you got to switch was pretty pitiful.<br />
<br />
also you do know reforging was only around for 2 expansions right? this was not some pinacle mechanic that had always been in the game, it was introduced to fix a problem, and once that problem was removed, was no longer needed</div></div><hr />

Well, right now i have about 3-4 420 and 425 items in my bags, but i still use my 400's instead because for some classes secondary stats are more important than primary one, any questions? Reforing will always be needed, because it's more than obvious that different classes require different secondary stats to operate optimally and it's just a tool to reduce an effect of massive rng and huge disappointment<br />
<br />
To answer your question about hit/experice, i absolutely loved minmaxing that particular aspect of the game, you didn't have everything handed to you, like you have now. That was the whole process of having least amount of extra secondary stat points in hit and expertise, you'd work around your items and you'd finally end up with perfectly balanced gear for your current ilvl and that was actually satisfying ( for me at least ). Now ? &quot;hmm i have 400 ilvl wrist with perfect secondary stats... but i just looted tf 425 wrist... and thanks for the free veiled crystal, because fuck you and fuck your class requirements</div></div><hr />

Exactly.<br />
<br />
When you got a Mastery trinket but had a good proc for your class you could re roll a bit of it to Crit or Haste.<br />

But of course Reforging would mess with Blizzards &quot;MUH DIABLO 3 RNG&quot; philosophy so don't expect to see it any time soon.</div></div><hr />

hmmm? i would love to see a single class that 425's are weaker then 400's<br />
<br />
also idk if you know, but reforging did not change 100% of a stat, it only changed a small amount, so no those 425's would not suddenly be better then your 400's if this is true.<br />
its only 40% of one stat</div></div><hr />

You know what i don't actually understand? It's totally fine if some people don't care about reforging and titanforging, they don't think it's an issue and they don't have a problem with it, they view it as a random pleasant surprise to casuals and stuff like that, fine.. but why are they against the change then? like if you truly don't care, why are you against the change which wouldn't hurt anybody, but probably give another reason to keep playing for players who's been here for more than a decade. I don't wanna sound like one of those &quot;I'm just waiting for classic&quot; guys, but i am... and i've been here since the times when alterac valley still wasn't in the game</div></div><hr />

<br />
can you link me the higher ilvl items you have that you havnt equipped?<br />
their names and ilvl<br />
<br />
so 420 belt<br />
425 ring<br />
425 wrist<br />
425 boots<br />
<br />
<br />
also yes your belt is stronger because it has a socket, and a socket is worth 15 ilvl, so 5 ilvl difference with difference of BIS stats sure<br />
boots is only 10 ilvl again.<br />
<br />
and again reforging would simply make it &quot;that thing that is only abit worse, is now abit better&quot;<br />
which comes with the issue of &quot;oh this item is bad for me here you can- oh wait i can reforge it, nvm&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
the issue with reforging is it EVEN MORE removes BIS by<br />
&quot;Oh hey you BIS is this item? weeeeeellll I need it cause i can reforge it to be better for me so..&quot;<br />

<br />
no it wouldnt, cause somethign that is 5 ilvl higher but has the 2 worse stats for you still wouldnt be an upgrade, cause 1 stat able to swap 40% would not be enough. also higher ilvl has NEVER meant &quot;100% upgrade&quot;<br />
<br />
back in vanilla and tbc a ring of +frost damage that gave plus 100 frost damage, is not an upgrade for my +10 shadow damage ring cause its hgiher.</div></div><hr />

And upgrades weren't necessarily about just doing the highest difficulty of content. There were outliers which were fun to get.</div></div><hr />
