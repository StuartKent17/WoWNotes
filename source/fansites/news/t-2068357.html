Chris Metzen (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Chris_Metzen) is leaving Blizzard to take a break and spend time with his family. We wish him the best and will miss him!<br />
I had just turned twenty years old when I started working at Blizzard. Seems like a lifetime ago. Guess it was. Those first few years were the start of a very grand adventure for me, one that would take me around the world, introduce me to thousands of wonderful geeks just like me—and ultimately shape the course of my adult life.<br />
<br />
Of course when I started, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I had no idea how to make games or build entertainment products.…<br />
<br />
But I had an insatiable passion for ideas. For stories. For heroes.<br />
<br />
My only real training before joining Blizzard was the long-running D&amp;D campaign I had with my closest friends—Sam, Mike P., Daniel, and Mikey C. (you know who you are, boys…HAMRO!). Building ideas—vast worldscapes, characters, and plotlines with my friends was my first great love. I lived for it. It was a safe space amid the tension and change of some rough teenage years. The grand refuge of D&amp;D was a glorious meeting of minds and imaginations where I felt I truly belonged. <br />
<br />
It was a space where friendship and imagination were inextricably linked. <br />
<br />
The sharing of ideas on the fly, the crazy, unexpected turns other players would take—it stretched our imaginations in ways we’d never have dreamt of on our own. I loved how roleplaying through adventures taught us so much about each other—and, more often than not, ourselves. Imagining together helped us make sense of the crazy world we were growing up in. It made us stronger together. <br />
<br />
I wouldn’t really understand the depth of it for many years, but I had learned an important truth from my friends back then: <br />
<br />
Creativity is relational. <br />
<br />
Looking back at my years at Blizzard, I see now how profoundly this idea has shaped my career. I see how profoundly my friends and coworkers at Blizzard have shaped me as a person. <br />
<br />
For nearly twenty-three years I’ve had the very distinct privilege of shaping worlds and building games with the brightest creative minds in entertainment. I’ve walked with giants (and stood on some giants’ shoulders, too). <br />
<br />
In short, I’ve had the time of my life. <br />
<br />
I pretty much had the coolest job ever—but the truth is, sometimes it was really hard. Building games with dozens of brilliant, passionate alpha-geeks with their own red-hot instincts and perspectives can be pretty tricky. Coming to consensus about certain design decisions, story motifs, or courses of art direction takes a lot of communication, patience, and “give and take.” It stretches you. Sometimes it wasn’t all that pretty. But engaging with your teammates and collaborating through the potential quagmire of all that creative tension is where the real magic happens. <br />
<br />
It’s not just the decisions you come to—or even the final shape of the product you craft.… It’s bigger than that—and infinitely more important. True collaboration builds trust—and trust is the basis of all lasting relationships. With trust you build more than just a great product. <br />
<br />
You build a TRIBE…that can build anything. <br />
<br />
A family of craftsmen.<br />
<br />
That’s what Blizzard has been for me. My second family, through all of life’s ups and downs, it’s always been there. The great, geeky backdrop of my life. I don’t just mean “the job” or even the creative mission—but the people. The people who over and over lifted me up, believed in me—and pushed me to find my potential as both an artist and as a leader all these years. <br />
<br />
To my Blizzard brothers and sisters…I wish I had the words.<br />
<br />
Everything just sounds…trite. <br />
<br />
All I can think of is…<br />
<br />
You helped me believe in myself and achieve every one of my wildest dreams. <br />
I am forever grateful to you. <br />
<br />
I love you all with everything I’ve got.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
And to all of you out there in Blizzard’s vast gaming community—those of you I’ve had the pleasure of meeting in person and all of you around the world I’ve only heard about—thank you. <br />
<br />
Thank you all for letting me be a special part of your community. For letting me belong with you. We’ve shared countless adventures together and I’ve always been overwhelmed and humbled by your passion for our games as well your commitment to each other. Thank you for all the BlizzCon hugs, smiles, handshakes, and stories over the years. You will never know how much you’ve all touched my heart and inspired me to give my all into this craft. <br />
<br />
With that said, I’ll try to get down to the point, here. I’ve come to a turn in the road. A new, far quieter chapter in my life looms ahead. <br />
<br />
I am retiring.<br />
<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
Hangin’ up my guns. <br />
Clockin’ out. <br />
Takin’ the last gryphon out of Stormwind. <br />
You get the picture. <br />
<br />
Crazy, I know.<br />
<br />
It’s a massive change for me, but it’s one I’ve been looking forward to for a while now. It’s ironic given the fact that things have never been better or more energized at Blizzard. Just this year alone has been incredible. <br />
<br />
Legion’s arrival. <br />
The launch of Overwatch. <br />
The Warcraft feature film.<br />
<br />
I’ve never been more proud of Blizzard and the quality of its products than I am now. It’s remarkable that even after all these years we can still reach new heights and take the world for an amazing ride. I believe Blizzard’s future is brighter than ever. <br />
<br />
I won’t lie—it’s going to be really hard stepping away from these worlds that I love. But I’m content that I’m leaving them in the hands of the most passionate, talented, and dedicated craftsmen ever assembled. <br />
<br />
I can’t wait to see where Blizzard’s worlds go next—and to experience them first-hand like everyone else does. As a fan. As an adventurer. Right back to the start. <br />
<br />
That’s just so cool…<br />
<br />
The reason I use the word “retire” is because I’m not going to some other company or starting up new projects or anything remotely like that. It’s been a long, amazing stretch of years. Now it’s time to slow it down. Rest. Lay around on the couch and get fat. Well, fatter.…<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I’ll be focusing on the one thing that matters most to me in all the world—my family. They’re the core of my life and the source of my deepest joy and inspiration. In addition to raising our two little ones, we recently welcomed our new baby into the family! Being home with them all, having time and space to really live…to love my wife with all my strength…that’s my career now. <br />
<br />
And I’ve never been happier.<br />
<br />
Ever. ☺<br />
<br />
Peace out, y’all.<br />
<br />
I love you all.<br />
<br />
I’ll see you online.<br />
<br />
Chris</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think he'll still do voice overs though, generally doesn't take much time to do (they wrap voice over movies in less than a week nowadays).<br />
<br />
I don't see Thrall dieing yet, it would be a bit too much overkill in legion.</div></div><hr />

WOD didn't look bad couple of weeks into the xpac. It did 2 years later.... <br />

Overwatch might actually be the reason he is really quitting. Cause he can see that WOW is not getting the support needed to keep up anymore. Fact is... the game hasn't for the past 5 years and more and more cutting corners will become aparent now.</div></div><hr />

I really didn't expect to see this for a long time. Metzen gets a ton of shit, and I never really understood it. You could definitely tell that this guy was incredibly emotionally invested in what he did. I found him to be inspiring. The dude clearly loved what he did. This (https://youtu.be/op-5E1zJ94Y?t=13m53s) video really highlights it for me.<br />
<br />
I have to imagine that he had known he was leaving for a good while now, I mean, he clearly felt a string connection with Thrall and if I remember correctly he as much as said that Thrall was supposed to mirror him in a way. We should have seen it coming when we heard Thrall was settling down and passing on Doomhammer. Pretty poetic. Don't get me wrong, I never really liked Thrall all that much and wish he died fighting Garrosh. It would have really given us a reason to kill him. I really like Metzen though and will miss his presence at Blizzard. Enjoy your retirement :D</div></div><hr />

As much as I like to mock Thrall 'Green Jesus' Metzen, the guy in general is great and someone who I've always liked at Blizzard. Can see he's very emotional about the products he works on, and obviously means how the passion causes friction at times. And even beyond all that I can quite easily understand his position and why he's leaving, it's for a very personal reason and, to me, the thing that is most important to someone, their family.<br />
<br />
Hope he enjoys his time with his family, and hope he still exists somewhat. I don't doubt Blizzard will ask him to do some Voiceovers for Thrall in the future, or potentially appear at a Blizzcon. Still, a legend of Blizzard and wish him all the best.</div></div><hr />

1. I wish the same for em :')<br />

2. I...idk. Maybe...thrall..is...done. Maybe he's retired....just like metzen. Wait a minute, thrall lost his powers, metzen didn't work on legion much, and when thrall retired his shamanism to go hang with family, metzen retired from blizzard to hang with his family....<br />
<br />
Oh shit, Is...is...is thrall...metzen...in...game? :O<br />
<br />
Well, makes sense anyways. Also, when thrall same the mantle of his lead towards us champions, thrall gave his mantle towards guys like ion, and alex, and all...<br />

Jesus, legion was foreshadowing this...maybe?!<br />

Yeah agree with this. Thrall was his avatar, glad to hear he is taking a break with his family but doubt this will be the last we see of him unless there are underlying health issues.<br />
<br />
Men like him get bored being away from the action. Family is great but when they're all at school you find yourself getting bored and wanting the fast action back</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's going to go insane from boredom if he doesn't find something to do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit: that being said, Warcraft has been a part of my life since I was 6 years old, and him leaving Blizzard really does feel like a loss, even though I hated his obsession with Thrall. I remember being inspired to draw as I looked at his artwork in the Warcraft II manual, he's had a big impact on me artistically.<br />
<br />
It's a big hit, but I feel like Ion and Dave have a good grasp of where to steer the ship.</div></div><hr />

Can I kill you...cause....how dare you? Metzen never appealed to just 12 y/os, he appealed to the GEEKS! He was never a developer, he was a lore god, and a blizzard god in general. He was what made lore good, and he is what made us geeks...GEEKS!<br />
<br />
Hell, you could even call him the unsung hero of the fucking world of gaming, that is...if you could even call it just the WORLD of gaming, it's so massive.<br />
<br />
No, METZEN WAS THE GOD! He was the one that made the universe of game RISE with power, he was the one...that made...this..world. And for that, he shall always be...the goku of gaming. :D<br />

He supervises to an extent, but it's been a very long time since he wrote or planned anything.<br />
<br />
The guy's got kids and is getting pretty old, I can't entirely say I'm surprised he's retiring, given how much he's stepped away from the spotlight over the last few years.</div></div><hr />

And I disagree with those saying that things will drastically change without him, considered how Metzen remained more and more on the sidelines during all these years (especially when it comes to WoW). On that regard, things slowly changed already.<br />
<br />
Nonetheless, he still was the face, heart and soul of Blizzard, its most prominent flag. Which means you're going to miss him just for what he was and represented, regardless of any supposed consequence on Blizzard itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I could say I hope, but I'm sure that someone, possibly many, will say the same about you in your life. If you don't have anything constructive or positive to say, maybe sit back and calm your misplaced anger. I hope you will put something as big as he did on the table of life after you leave. <br />

Metzen hasnt really been involved with the writing since Overwatch. He already made a statement a while back about him moving towards Overwatch and such, so he didnt really have that much of a presence in terms of Legions writing. He was already uninvolved with a lot of things in terms of WoW.</div></div><hr />

This is exactly how I feel. As a kid flipping through the Warcraft 2 booklet, seeing the story and drawings and always seeing &quot;METZEN '94&quot; or whatever year on the writing, I knew who he was without knowing who he was. I don't know how much he had his hands in these days but Blizzard wouldn't be where it is without him. He's a true hero. DE END.</div></div><hr />

Probably not a lot, honestly. For one, at least the next two expansions are surely already planned out by now.<br />
<br />
But even ignoring that, Metzen's direct involvement with WoW has been fairly minimal at least as far back as Mists of Pandaria, and he wasn't even especially involved in Overwatch, which is really Jeff Kaplan's baby.<br />
<br />
It may feel like a changing of the guard, but the fact is that the torch was already passed some time ago.<br />
<br />
Also, while he's retiring, I don't think I'd be surprised if he still shows up from time to time. I'm sure he'll be around at Blizzcon and will probably still lend his voice to Thrall from time to time, when needed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That said, if they continue making Thrall a giant wuss I'd rather they just put him out of his misery. I hate seeing a great hero character, the main character that brought me to WoW, languish in lore hell like he has since Cata. <br />
<br />
Aside from Thrall, I'll really miss Metzen. I don't give a shit about the emo twats that love to rag on him, he has always been the heart of Blizzard to me. One only has to watch the reveal of Legion compared to the other expansions to see the difference in passion and excitement. He will be sorely missed and never truly replaced.</div></div><hr />

Is that right? Kosak didn't seem that involved in Warlords, to me. He was barely around during that expansion. Don't even remember him being on the BTS DVD. Mists of Pandaria was all Kosak, though, and I personally felt his passion shine through in that one.</div></div><hr />

You realize he's also the one who made everything you came to love in the first place right? WC3, Classic/BC/Wrath, that was all him. Show some respect.<br />

I think y'all are overestimating how much WoW is Metzen these days. The team is huge.<br />

To say this indicated Legion has &quot;tanked&quot; is probably the most trollish, facetious and ridiculous thing you can possibly say. It's successful by anyone's measure.<br />

Lots of things happening lately, that is for sure. But Blizzard has come a long way over the last few years.

That likely means anyone else he voiced will likely either be killed or quietly retired, too. So guess that means Thrall won't have more story in later patches unless it's unvoiced and Varian likely won't be a fel corrupted raid boss later unless they pre-recorded lines or Metzen comes back to voice them ... or they find a soundalike.</div></div><hr />

Of course they could just get a new voice actor, or kill the character...I am going to think with the recent trend of killing off characters thrall is next.</div></div><hr />

I'm really, really surprised he's stepping down. I'm sure he'll maintain some sort of status within the company, and along with his stocks and &quot;created by&quot; royalties I'm sure he'll be financially stable for years to come.<br />
<br />
I can guarantee you with 100% certainty he does not get any royalties. This isn't a rock band. Everything he wrote for Blizzard, Blizzard owns, completely. <br />
<br />
No doubt he has fat stacks, with his stock options, salary and bonuses. Plus, his wife works. He may have gotten a fat check for writing the movie, though. And, he MAY make some money off the movie profits, if there are any, as he was a producer.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
This is big. Metzen was the story guy. And their new franchise guy. But, I can see him being burned out - 20 years on the same characters and settings has to get boring after a while. And, I can also see him getting a taste of movie writing, and book writing, and I can totally see him coming back in a couple years as more of a real writer, and not doing anything game related. I think we'll see him again, one way or another. <br />
<br />
He's got a resume like no other, he's designed shipped some of the world's biggest and most successful games, and widely respected in the industry. As Kevin Smith says on his podcast - big bucket of win there. Monster career. <br />
<br />
He's lucky - successful, married, new kid, probably plans for more, can buy a house anywhere and spend a couple years trying out all the games he never had time to play, movies to watch, books to read. I envy him! <br />
<br />
So long Metzen, and thanks for all the murlocs!</div></div><hr />

<br />
This was definitely unexpected. Wish him luck. He seemed like a pretty cool dude.<br />
<br />
Possibly part of the reason they killed Varian, but Metzen hasn't voiced Vol'Jin for a while, Dave Fennoy had been doing the voice since Mists IIRC<br />
<br />
I'll definitely miss Metzen though, especially come Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although, I've felt for a long time that his style of storytelling was getting real old, and I'm optimistic that this will be an opportunity for some new blood to rise up and steer WoW story in a &quot;better&quot; direction. Fingers crossed!</div></div><hr />

Thought the same thing. He's stepping away from WoW and Thrall's story has long been done. It's time he either fades off into obscurity or becomes cannon fodder.<br />

I wish Chris all the best in his adventures forward.</div></div><hr />

Oh please, nobody played for the story which Metzen had a hand in. Everyone stayed for the amazing gameplay and polished mechanics, which Metzen did not do. <br />
<br />
He was a Creative Designer, not Lead Designer, not quest, world, dungeon or raid designer. Metzen was a small cog in the machine, but was one of the faces of PR for Blizzard. Which is why he got so popular.</div></div><hr />

Chris Metzen (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Chris_Metzen) is leaving Blizzard to take a break and spend time with his family. We wish him the best and will miss him!<br />
I had just turned twenty years old when I started working at Blizzard. Seems like a lifetime ago. Guess it was. Those first few years were the start of a very grand adventure for me, one that would take me around the world, introduce me to thousands of wonderful geeks just like me—and ultimately shape the course of my adult life.<br />
<br />
Of course when I started, I had absolutely no idea what I was doing. I had no idea how to make games or build entertainment products.…<br />
<br />
But I had an insatiable passion for ideas. For stories. For heroes.<br />
<br />
My only real training before joining Blizzard was the long-running D&amp;D campaign I had with my closest friends—Sam, Mike P., Daniel, and Mikey C. (you know who you are, boys…HAMRO!). Building ideas—vast worldscapes, characters, and plotlines with my friends was my first great love. I lived for it. It was a safe space amid the tension and change of some rough teenage years. The grand refuge of D&amp;D was a glorious meeting of minds and imaginations where I felt I truly belonged. <br />
<br />
It was a space where friendship and imagination were inextricably linked. <br />
<br />
The sharing of ideas on the fly, the crazy, unexpected turns other players would take—it stretched our imaginations in ways we’d never have dreamt of on our own. I loved how roleplaying through adventures taught us so much about each other—and, more often than not, ourselves. Imagining together helped us make sense of the crazy world we were growing up in. It made us stronger together. <br />
<br />
I wouldn’t really understand the depth of it for many years, but I had learned an important truth from my friends back then: <br />
<br />
Creativity is relational. <br />
<br />
Looking back at my years at Blizzard, I see now how profoundly this idea has shaped my career. I see how profoundly my friends and coworkers at Blizzard have shaped me as a person. <br />
<br />
For nearly twenty-three years I’ve had the very distinct privilege of shaping worlds and building games with the brightest creative minds in entertainment. I’ve walked with giants (and stood on some giants’ shoulders, too). <br />
<br />
In short, I’ve had the time of my life. <br />
<br />
I pretty much had the coolest job ever—but the truth is, sometimes it was really hard. Building games with dozens of brilliant, passionate alpha-geeks with their own red-hot instincts and perspectives can be pretty tricky. Coming to consensus about certain design decisions, story motifs, or courses of art direction takes a lot of communication, patience, and “give and take.” It stretches you. Sometimes it wasn’t all that pretty. But engaging with your teammates and collaborating through the potential quagmire of all that creative tension is where the real magic happens. <br />
<br />
It’s not just the decisions you come to—or even the final shape of the product you craft.… It’s bigger than that—and infinitely more important. True collaboration builds trust—and trust is the basis of all lasting relationships. With trust you build more than just a great product. <br />
<br />
You build a TRIBE…that can build anything. <br />
<br />
A family of craftsmen.<br />
<br />
That’s what Blizzard has been for me. My second family, through all of life’s ups and downs, it’s always been there. The great, geeky backdrop of my life. I don’t just mean “the job” or even the creative mission—but the people. The people who over and over lifted me up, believed in me—and pushed me to find my potential as both an artist and as a leader all these years. <br />
<br />
To my Blizzard brothers and sisters…I wish I had the words.<br />
<br />
Everything just sounds…trite. <br />
<br />
All I can think of is…<br />
<br />
You helped me believe in myself and achieve every one of my wildest dreams. <br />
I am forever grateful to you. <br />
<br />
I love you all with everything I’ve got.<br />
<br />
Thank you.<br />
<br />
And to all of you out there in Blizzard’s vast gaming community—those of you I’ve had the pleasure of meeting in person and all of you around the world I’ve only heard about—thank you. <br />
<br />
Thank you all for letting me be a special part of your community. For letting me belong with you. We’ve shared countless adventures together and I’ve always been overwhelmed and humbled by your passion for our games as well your commitment to each other. Thank you for all the BlizzCon hugs, smiles, handshakes, and stories over the years. You will never know how much you’ve all touched my heart and inspired me to give my all into this craft. <br />
<br />
With that said, I’ll try to get down to the point, here. I’ve come to a turn in the road. A new, far quieter chapter in my life looms ahead. <br />
<br />
I am retiring.<br />
<br />
Yup.<br />
<br />
Hangin’ up my guns. <br />
Clockin’ out. <br />
Takin’ the last gryphon out of Stormwind. <br />
You get the picture. <br />
<br />
Crazy, I know.<br />
<br />
It’s a massive change for me, but it’s one I’ve been looking forward to for a while now. It’s ironic given the fact that things have never been better or more energized at Blizzard. Just this year alone has been incredible. <br />
<br />
Legion’s arrival. <br />
The launch of Overwatch. <br />
The Warcraft feature film.<br />
<br />
I’ve never been more proud of Blizzard and the quality of its products than I am now. It’s remarkable that even after all these years we can still reach new heights and take the world for an amazing ride. I believe Blizzard’s future is brighter than ever. <br />
<br />
I won’t lie—it’s going to be really hard stepping away from these worlds that I love. But I’m content that I’m leaving them in the hands of the most passionate, talented, and dedicated craftsmen ever assembled. <br />
<br />
I can’t wait to see where Blizzard’s worlds go next—and to experience them first-hand like everyone else does. As a fan. As an adventurer. Right back to the start. <br />
<br />
That’s just so cool…<br />
<br />
The reason I use the word “retire” is because I’m not going to some other company or starting up new projects or anything remotely like that. It’s been a long, amazing stretch of years. Now it’s time to slow it down. Rest. Lay around on the couch and get fat. Well, fatter.…<br />
<br />
Seriously though, I’ll be focusing on the one thing that matters most to me in all the world—my family. They’re the core of my life and the source of my deepest joy and inspiration. In addition to raising our two little ones, we recently welcomed our new baby into the family! Being home with them all, having time and space to really live…to love my wife with all my strength…that’s my career now. <br />
<br />
And I’ve never been happier.<br />
<br />
Ever. ☺<br />
<br />
Peace out, y’all.<br />
<br />
I love you all.<br />
<br />
I’ll see you online.<br />
<br />
Chris<br />
<br />
See, they are all leaving.<br />
<br />
We all thought that WoW was dying. It's actually Blizzard, that is dying.<br />
<br />
I guess that is why Thrall gave up the Doomhammer.<br />
<br />
Who's gonna voice him now? <br />
<br />
Is that why Varian died? Is Thrall gonna die, too?</div></div><hr />

<br />
To this day I still do not get the Green Jesus moniker. I've asked on numerous occasions, even to my own guildies and it's always &quot;Dragon Soul&quot; or a vague non answer. <br />
<br />
So he turns up in Dragon Soul and gets used as the conduit for the Aspects to kill Deathwing. So what? He doesn't actually do anything, he just holds the Dragon Soul more or less, the Aspects do all the work. I mean what other Shaman is there to use, narrative wise?</div></div><hr />

A man quits after 20 + years of creating quality games. This man will go down as being part of one of the greatest games of all time. This is not even on par with undercooked food. The difference between us and metzen is that we all played metzen's game... he made it.

<br />
As much as I'm sure there's already &quot;Sinking ship WoW is dying posts!&quot; all over by now, I think it's pretty obvious this has been planned for quite a while. From the way Chris has stepped back from public appearances and any kind of WoW-related interview in the past couple of years (he's even not talked about Overwatch much at all since Blizzcon), to the way Varian was killed off and Thrall was written out of the story and given an emotional passing of the torch ingame to go spend time with his family instead of continuing to serve the Earthen Ring...<br />
<br />
It's quite sure that this has been in the works for a while and that he's leaving on good terms. Talk shit about him plenty but still, gonna miss this gaming legend! Take care Chris.</div></div><hr />

Besides, didn't Chris work on other things than WoW for quite some time now? <br />

I wish I could retire (yes, I truly believe that's what he's doing) at the age of 42.</div></div><hr />

Normally I'm not much into conspiracies but when big names start to leave like that and start a new company it tends to mean some kind of a conflict in the company.<br />
When you're in positions like &quot;Senior VP of X&quot; and &quot;Director of Y&quot; there's not much room to advance or grow besides take over as CEO or found a new company.<br />
<br />
Moreover, a company like Blizzard doesn't have a ton of room to innovate or create new IPs. If you want to do something that isn't WoW, SC, Diablo, or Overwatch, you'd have to look elsewhere. And after well over a decade working on those properites, I don't think it's any surprise that some of those people would want to move on and try something different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Idd. I wonder if that little guy is aware that there are companies still going strong and producing the same products despite the entire roster of founding fathers dying from old age decades ago... Not that Chris was a founder, but still.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one can replace him, no one should try to. <br />
He was indeed the heart and soul of Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I saw Metzen talk at a couple blizzcons, and have always been a critic of the writing in the game. Ret-continuity, shoddy fact checking, Red Shirt guy exists because of the writing team and scope of this project. I actually always got the impression that Metzen had just worked on this too long, he was done, checked out, and needed to do something else with his life.. This just kinda confirms my suspicions. I don't think he wasn't a huge fan, enthusiast for his team. But I think he's been putting it on for a while. I'm happy to hear he's got a new avenue for his entire attention/ entire affection. <br />
<br />
I think we're just witnessing a change of the guard you guys. This is a team with the best talent in the world, who create content so good that you will work for peanuts to just put them on your resume. Everyone is there to do the best, and the guys who've been around 20-25 years are probably just out of gas for orcs and humans you know? Nothing wrong with that at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Trumpcat</div><div class="date">2016-09-13, 05:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Chris Metzen's passion and ideas inspired millions of people and filled many lives with great emotions and memories. Blizzard's games and Warcraft in particular, since its earliest chapter Warcraft: Orcs &amp; Humans have illuminated my childhood. Before gameplay, mechanics, graphics, there was the story that captured my imagination. <br />
<br />
Chris Metzen created some of the best stories and characters we have in entertainment today, not because of their intricate complexity, but for their overwhelming appeal. The only one I can compare Chris Metzen to is George Lucas.<br />
<br />
And now that his task is done, he can take his place, among the legends, of the past...<br />
<br />
I also cried.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but he already said that he's intent is to still do Thrall's voice.</div></div><hr />

I met him in 2010 at BlizzCon and he was a man of epic mind. We've talked for like, five minutes or so about everything Blizzard and I remember how enthusiastic he was, how laid-back he was. A true mastermind of Blizzard. Sad to see him go, but family always comes first. He will be missed.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, i don't personally care much about of these news.<br />
<br />
But if it means we really could get rid of thrall, fuck yes!</div></div><hr />

Or maybe he's just retiring because he's able to. I hope it's not the first, but either way I'll miss the guy.</div></div><hr />
