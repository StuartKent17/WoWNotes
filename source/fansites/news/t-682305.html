PvP starting gear in Cataclysm easier to obtain?<br />
The fourth question, about the availability of starter gear in PvP, is something we are working right this moment on improving for Cataclysm. Players tended to view the Lich King starter gear as either tedious or a distraction while at the same time they were able to get high item level weapons from PvE. Those two factors contributed a lot to the very short matches we had in the first season.<br />
<br />
We know players need some minimum level of resilience (say somewhere in the 300 - 500 range) before they feel like they can survive long enough to do anything. We need to make sure players generally aren't stepping into Arenas or BGs without it. <br />
<br />
[...] I think 1000 is probably the point where you really start to feel like you aren't going to die at any given second. But that's okay as long as it is reasonably attainable. We offer resilience on gear largely as a reward. It's a good milestone when you realize that the gear you have worked to obtain is now keeping you alive. It's comparable to a raid that has trouble on a boss until they get enough of the right gear, at which point they now stand a good chance to beat him. In other words, if we didn't want players to have to work to get resilience, we'd just make it a passive damage reduction aura in Arenas and BGs.<br />
<br />
But I do agree the starting sets of resilience gear in LK were unattractive given the investment it took to get them. To use my raid example above, you shouldn't be facing the boss in greens either. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21626553659-shadow-priests-general-pvp-and-40.html))<br />

Patch 3.3 Dungeon System Questions<br />
Will the random heroic search have the option of excluding certain heroics (i.e. oculus?)<br />
You do not have the option to exclude specific Heroic dungeons, however, if you've already run a specific Heroic dungeon that day, it is less likely to be randomly selected for you. <br />
<br />
Will players still need to purchase keys to queue for TBC heroics?<br />
All standard requirements for entering a dungeon will remain. For instance, if you log into the game just after patch 3.3's release and queue for a Random Heroic dungeon, you will not be selected for the Icecrown Citadel Pit of Saron or Halls of Reflection wings unless you've cleared your way through each preceding wing in order to unlock the next wing (i.e. you must clear Forge of Souls for Pit of Saron, and Pit of Saron for Halls of Reflection). <br />
<br />
- I've heard players will no longer be saved to heroics. Does this mean we can farm Champion's Seals?<br />
Heroic lockouts still exist. The only difference is that the Random Heroic option will ignore lockouts. So if you've run every single Wrath of the Lich King Heroic dungeon in a day, you can still choose the Random Heroic option to continue running them. You can do this as often as time allows since this option will ignore lockout timers. As I said above though, the Heroic dungeons you've run the most that day will be less likely to be randomly chosen by the system. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21626383487-new-lfgtool-questions.html))<br />
<br />
Downranking<br />
I've addressed the downranking issue enough that you can probably find a good explanation for why we nerfed it.<br />
<br />
The big problem with downranking was it propped up coefficients at the expense of everything else. It wasn't just that the lower ranked heals were cheaper. It was that the higher ranked heals just didn't have much to offer because the coefficients so completely trumped the flat points of the spell. The part of downranking that was choosing the cheap, small spell over the big, expensive spell was compelling, I'll grant you. But the part of it that was ignoring new spells because high spell power (or + healing back in the day) gave the lower ranks such great legs was just problematic for many reasons.<br />
<br />
I agree that we need to make sure every class feels like they have the choice between big and small heals, and that may mean adding new heals to Cataclysm. On the other hand, priests have say Flash Heal and Greater Heal now but don't necessarily use them equally. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/21627632910-healing-in-cata--blizz-post.html))<br />
<br />
Useless/Overpowered healing sources - Lightwell and Replenishment<br />
I don't think Lightwell means non-healers don't care about their health. Lightwell means they aren't willing to take a huge dps hit (including losing targeting) to get it. Most players will use Healthstones in my experience. They just don't feel like they offer that much currently because the healers will be able to cover them. <br />
<br />
[...] I know Replenishment is a popular bogeyman, but we don't think Replenishment itself is the problem. It's just a generous source of regen at a time when there are many generous sources of regen. We'd more likely to nerf everything than just Replenishment, because we like having player power grow so much when you're in a group. <br />
<br />
[...] I'm not sure Replenishment even makes sense in its current incarnation in Cataclysm. Once all healers like Spirit, then Replenishment could just boost Spirit-based regen. But this is something we haven't worked completely through yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/21627632910-healing-in-cata--blizz-post.html))<br />
<br />
Mana pool management = Caster DPS vs. Healer<br />
When you think about the actual experience though the difference comes down to more damage nearly always being better while healing has a target, beyond which more healing isn't necessary because everyone is at 100% of their health. Overhealing exists as a concept, whereas overdamage does not (except in a few isolated fights or when threat is an issue). In a very coarse sense, damage is about as going as fast as you can while healing is about hitting your target -- damage is a 50 yard dash, while healing is playing darts.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, most healing rotations aren't terrible complicated because they can't afford to be. If you had to get up e.g. 3 periodic spells and self buffs before you could even do your job, then a lot of time players would be dead before you could ever get around to actually saving their lives. Having a long ramp up time would just kill healing.<br />
<br />
So the healing game ultimately becomes more about using the right tool for the job. If someone takes a little damage but isn't likely to die, a hot is a great idea. If someone is about to die, you might need a very fast spell or even a cooldown. If a lot of players take damage at once, an AE looks attractive. If you know you won't be able to cast for awhile (maybe you're moving) then again something with a duration like a hot or shield is the ticket. And so on....<br />
<br />
Mana efficiency is ideally part of this calculus. If mana doesn't matter, then either your highest healing-per-second spell or your fastest spell (depending on the situation) is always the best choice. Increasingly in LK, it's just the fastest spell that wins because of the nature of incoming damage. If mana doesn't matter, then you aren't trying to hit the bullseye I described above because missing the bullseye (overhealing) has no consequence. If you use the proverbial bazooka to kill cockroaches, then who cares?<br />
<br />
Many long-term healers (and I'll include myself in that) enjoy healing because you feel smart when you do it right. Part of that &quot;smartiness&quot; is using the right tool for the job. It's a different approach to the game than say a mage or warlock uses however. To some degree it's hard for me to understand how you like healing if you don't like mana management. :)<br />
<br />
Now, in much of the above, I'm describing an ideal situation. Mana generally matters a lot less in Lich King for healers than we'd like, so instead of challenging healers to hit the target we just challenge healers to keep as many darts in the air as possible. If you miss even a single GCD, then it's possible someone is going to die. That doesn't feel like smart playing to many players. That feels like whack-a-mole.<br />
<br />
Now don't jump to the opposite extreme and assume what we intend for Cataclysm is for healers to stand around a lot and regen. What we'd rather see is that say a Holy priest uses Renew in some situations, Flash Heal in others, Greater Heal in others, CoH in others, and so on. Furthermore, we'd like to see more coordination among the healers (again because the risk of going OOM exists). That doesn't have to mean talking on Vent, though it could be that too. It could be as simple as assigning more targets or roles for your healers instead of just &quot;You heal the tank, everyone else heal the raid.&quot;<br />
<br />
In addition, once the group learns that healing mana matters, then individual survivability matters more too. Health stones, pots and even bandages do something. An avoid-damage ability like Barkskin or Dispersion is an interesting part of the dps toolbox instead of a PvP-only spell. Standing in fires is dangerous rather than just sloppy playing. Avoidance on tanks is more attractive because being the guy who requires tons of healing can be as much of a liability as the guy who dies from big boss hits.<br />
<br />
Yes, the risk is that the game becomes so stressful for healers that it's not fun for them. But I think healing can definitely be stressful now, and in a physically exhausting way instead of a I-need-to-make-smart-decisions-quickly way.

Are pets going to scale for 3.3?<br />
If we can get it in. On a technical side, the implementation just ends up being a little different for every stat.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that pet scaling isn't essential to good damage. It's only essential for keeping your pet's damage growing at the same rate as your damage, and by extension keeping your total damage growing at the same rate as other classes. There aren't going to be 3 more tiers of content for Lich King, so it only gets to be an issue if other classes scale so much better that they leapfrog you in Icecrown / the final PvP season. <br />

Why can't warlocks have stackable shards?<br />
Technically we have trouble altering inventory space in existing characters, and that would especially be true for the shard bag. We can do it, but it's a pretty high risk change when you consider all of the things that can go wrong. For that reason, we'd prefer to do it during an expansion when we have plenty of time to solve any unforeseen problems that arise.<br />
<br />
On the design side, we'd prefer to unveil new mechanics that all work well together rather than make changes now that we'd just turn around and undo. What I mean is that we don't want to sideline soul shards even more for the next few months to the point where locks, especially newer ones, sort of forget about them only to bring them back in a big way for Cataclysm.

Let's explain a joke, makes it more fun (/sarcasm)<br />

Anyway I think it refers to next patch, where you can't roll need on gear you can't use or isn't useful to you when forming a pug through the new system.<br />

So he ran to a weapon trainer and got back before the looting was done and could roll need on the pointy thing.<br />

Theres no way a new shard system will be implemented before Cataclysm, and i even have suspiscion it wont even be ready when Cataclysm launches.<br />

There is evidence from Blizzcon that they already have some of the system ready. The problem is the amount of work that needs to be done to ensure the current system, which they will dump come cataclysm, will work with the existing spells, talent trees, balancing aspects, soul shard bags, etc....<br />

Yea, i would say it is a very lengthly and difficult process to achieve. I'm not saying it is easy to do, but i am saying it is difficult and time consuming, which is why i dont think it will be ready for Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Ah well though, maybe ill be proven wrong, the sooner it is done the better it will be :)<br />
<br />
But you can understand that 3 years of waiting (with a 4th year of not seeing it change and not playing Warlock), kinda makes me doubtful it will ever be ready ^^ (Ive heard them say they are working on a new shard system a million times already)</div></div><hr />

Anyway I think it refers to next patch, where you can't roll need on gear you can't use or isn't useful to you when forming a pug through the new system.<br />

So he ran to a weapon trainer and got back before the looting was done and could roll need on the pointy thing.<br />

I don't think I fully comprehend the thought that they can't make soulshards stack. Having absolutely no knowledge of programming, it doesn't seem like it would affect item id in terms of spells looking for them, it would just affect their maximum sack number from 1 to X.

They were referring to all the 2h classes running around with Betrayers at the start of season 5 because the PvP weapons sucked.<br />
Also, it's not supposed to be a &quot;high ilvl weapon&quot; but a starter one for arena...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Initially they wanted the soulshards to be &quot;named / unique&quot;, showing a reflection of the creature / player that you drained from it. That was way early in the alpha/beta stage though. Some shards could have a different color/aura and strength.<br />
<br />
But yeah, they should be easily able to make them stack now.<br />
And could even attach a &quot;Unique(40)&quot; flag on them to limit the number they can allow locks to gather at one time.<br />

No way, programming is easy! This shard business is a Blizzard conspiracy; everyone knows that private servers function flawlessly. Blizzard just doesn't know how to program and won't admit it. And they hate warlocks!<br />
<br />
OT: I LOLed at DLC. And I really like the &quot;whack-a-mole&quot; analogy for current healing. Taking this post in conjunction with the general idea that blizzard wants to buff health pools, potentially weaken heals in a relative sense, and improve healer cooperation, I think I will like the direction healing is going.<br />
<br />
Re. PvP vs. PvE balancing: The smartest thing I've ever heard was the bit about adding a damage reduction aura in BGs and arenas. Too bad it was being used as an example of what they don't want to do.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Peacemoon</div><div class="date">2009-12-07, 04:18 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ghostcrawlers text on healing is very informing. As someone who has played healer for 8+ years in MMO's, I have to say I agree with him. <br />
<br />
The difference between a good healer and a bad healer should be the ability to choose the right spells for the correct moment as well as manage your mana. I miss the days when bad healers were OOM straight away from spamming ineffecient spells at the wrong time. <br />
<br />
These days however that element of skill has been eroded and yes, I do feel healing in WoW has suffered greatly. Especially in 25 man raids its become more about reaction times and spamming ability then actual intelligent and precise healing. Its more about trying to get off a spell before the &quot;competition&quot; then it does actually healing properly. 10 man healing is more fun and interesting granted, and 5 man healing ofcourse is a chore because how easy the instances are.<br />
<br />
On top of this, Blizzard really need to balance the healing classes. Compared to how finely tuned tank classes are, healers are horribly inbalanced. Both in terms of mana regen and healing output. All healers should be capable of tank and raid healing, given the right talents. That is my opinion anyway.</div></div><hr />

The fourth question, about the availability of starter gear in PvP, is something we are working right this moment on improving for Cataclysm. Players tended to view the Lich King starter gear as either tedious or a distraction while at the same time they were able to get high item level weapons from PvE. Those two factors contributed a lot to the very short matches we had in the first season.<br />
<br />
We know players need some minimum level of resilience (say somewhere in the 300 - 500 range) before they feel like they can survive long enough to do anything. We need to make sure players generally aren't stepping into Arenas or BGs without it.<br />
<br />
There is a simple solution to all this, that would fix PLENTY of other very annoying issues that corrode PvP and PvE scene. It's by removing resilience as a stat on items, and just making it a stat you gain through itemlevels. This fix would get rid of the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP players lack of interest in raiding 25man content<br />
Hard entry to PuGing PvE content with a very non-optimal gearset, bench the resi guy and take the guy that does more DPS<br />
Lack of itemization for PvP oriented players<br />
Botting in battlegrounds, since you could choose to PvE for your items if you dislike playing battlegrounds so much<br />
Outdated insignias<br />
Low resi, high damage pve/pvp set compilations fastening the already fast pace of arenas and PvP in general<br />
<br />
<br />
Those are just to name a few. It's been &quot;either/or&quot; and &quot;them vs. us&quot; for too long in WoW. I'd rather have both PvE and PvP in the same package, as I greatly enjoy both. The arena rewards themselves and battleground rewards could be also slightly lower itemlevel compared to the highest obtainable PvE items, much like they are now. You could get a 245set through arenas, where the PvE hardmode rewards would still be very tempting being 258ilvl, and now you could actually have a shot at getting to raid that content with not being at such a gear disadvantage with your resilience/stam itemisation madness.</div></div><hr />

Even saving me that 1% of the time would be nice if it weren't for the fact any of my cooldowns were thousands of times more effective than it. As it is, I just bind /use Healthstone to one of my cooldowns and ignore it. There's just no way to use it effectively as a tank.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole idea of scaling resilience from 0 to some arbitrarily large number as progression through arena does not seem that effective. While it's not a problem for people who've already met the 1000 resilience mark, it's always been a huge annoyance for the fresh blood. That annoyance is keeping a lot of exceptional players from even trying.<br />
<br />
- A strictly balanced, extremely easily obtained regulation set (all slots) with a lot of gem slots.<br />
- Resilience always hangs around the 1000 mark. (May go up or down by a little bit depending on gemming and enchanting.)<br />
- New arena rules set in place by the Azeroth Arena Commission stating that all athletes must be wearing the regulation gear.<br />
<br />

Why can't warlocks have stackable shards?<br />
Technically we have trouble altering inventory space in existing characters, and that would especially be true for the shard bag. We can do it, but it's a pretty high risk change when you consider all of the things that can go wrong. For that reason, we'd prefer to do it during an expansion when we have plenty of time to solve any unforeseen problems that arise.<br />
<br />
On the design side, we'd prefer to unveil new mechanics that all work well together rather than make changes now that we'd just turn around and undo. What I mean is that we don't want to sideline soul shards even more for the next few months to the point where locks, especially newer ones, sort of forget about them only to bring them back in a big way for Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21626543512-a-technical-question-on-shards.html))<br />
<br />
The excuse of the technical difficulty is bullshit. Let me tell you from a person, who has spent some time with so called &quot;wow emulators&quot; or &quot;free wow server implementations&quot; (and i mean the technical aspects, like programming and database maintenance): To make shards stackable, it is enough to change 1 variable in the item definition (something like &quot;stackable=1&quot; to &quot;stackable=20&quot;). There are zero unforseen consequences or difficulties to that.<br />
<br />
Let me explain it more detailed:<br />
A) At the moment player1 has 15 shards in his bags, or to be more precise, he has 15 stacks of 1 shard in his bags. If he tries to stack them, it won't work, because of their restriction of &quot;stackable=1&quot;, so they occupy 15 slots.<br />
B) Now the stacking limitation of shards is set to &quot;stackable=20&quot;.<br />
C) What happens to the inventory of player1? Nothing. He still has 15 stacks of 1 shard, occupying 15 slots. The only difference is, that if he now tries to stack the shards, he will be able to.<br />
<br />
Why would blizzard feel the need to mess with the inventory of players? I don't think that any warlock would be mad, because he has to stack his shards manually one single time after the change is made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What exactly is the difference between Hunter's ammo and Warlock's Shards? ::)<br />
<br />
Ammo does exactly this which Blizz do not want to do. Mess with player inventory all the time. No wonder they want to get rid of it (along with quivers and ammo pouches).<br />
.<br />
Rather silly GC or any other Blizz representative did not say exactly this about Hunter's Ammo. &quot;Due to messing with player inventory we would like to change the ammo mechanics to something different. It's awkward mechanics and it causes unpredictable server lag on massive scale due to unforeseen bad coding on our part.&quot; ;)</div></div><hr />

Why can't warlocks have stackable shards?<br />
Technically we have trouble altering inventory space in existing characters, and that would especially be true for the shard bag. We can do it, but it's a pretty high risk change when you consider all of the things that can go wrong. For that reason, we'd prefer to do it during an expansion when we have plenty of time to solve any unforeseen problems that arise.<br />
<br />
On the design side, we'd prefer to unveil new mechanics that all work well together rather than make changes now that we'd just turn around and undo. What I mean is that we don't want to sideline soul shards even more for the next few months to the point where locks, especially newer ones, sort of forget about them only to bring them back in a big way for Cataclysm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21626543512-a-technical-question-on-shards.html))<br />
<br />
The excuse of the technical difficulty is bullshit. Let me tell you from a person, who has spent some time with so called &quot;wow emulators&quot; or &quot;free wow server implementations&quot; (and i mean the technical aspects, like programming and database maintenance): To make shards stackable, it is enough to change 1 variable in the item definition (something like &quot;stackable=1&quot; to &quot;stackable=20&quot;). There are zero unforseen consequences or difficulties to that.<br />
<br />
Let me explain it more detailed:<br />
A) At the moment player1 has 15 shards in his bags, or to be more precise, he has 15 stacks of 1 shard in his bags. If he tries to stack them, it won't work, because of their restriction of &quot;stackable=1&quot;, so they occupy 15 slots.<br />
B) Now the stacking limitation of shards is set to &quot;stackable=20&quot;.<br />

<br />
The difficulty isn't in making the shards stackable, it has to do with soul shard specific bags. They actually talk a lot about how difficult it is for them to alter that sort of thing. Its also given as the the reason that they can't replace or change the size of the original backpack we start with at level one.</div></div><hr />

i really dunno. i've just talked with a gm and *seems* they plan to remove that achievement. but i'm quite suspicious, i dont trust him too much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They learn from their mistakes, so its not odd to not have that happen this time.<br />
Just from a designer/bugfix PoV they either have to release this week or next year.<br />
Having a release next week would be to close to the major holiday season (and thus people going on vacation etc) to ensure that gamebreaking buggs get fixed asap etc.<br />
<br />
With the gating they already bought themselves more time, since the Arthas fight wont be seen on servers for months and its not unlikely to have 0 unlocks in 09 at all actually.<br />
Im 99.9999999999% positive it will be released this week, even if no &quot;hints&quot; to such a release happened yet.</div></div><hr />

Makes me wonder why we can't make that sticky into a global announcement of a sort.<br />
