Even as the 'last resort, nothing short of the apocalypse could make it later' date, it's sad to see them thinking it could potentially be that far off. And here I was thinking 1 more full PVP season would be longer than they wanted to wait... I don't think the ICC tier WITH the ruby sanctum update was that long, and they even admitted they took too long to get Cataclysm out after that one. December 20th 2014 would be ruinous.</div></div><hr />

It says on the site itself..<br />

Sure, but you're forgetting that SWTOR still has an active player base, which took players from WoW ;). And why would one want to play a game from 2004 with enhanced graphics while they can play the top notch games?</div></div><hr />

Most of the MMORPG players obviosly are not this type of person, who cares about graphics the most. In fact, the reality, that WoW is still the strongest mmorpg is the evidence, that rpg players care about graphics really little. <br />

<br />
That's why we can't have nice things.<br />
<br />
I can't believe they are pushing the pre-order when they state: Expected release on or before december 20th. I guess, we should pre-order our StarWars Episode VII movie tickets, because, it's soon coming up, and it CAN'T BE BAD right?

That said, yeah, not worrying about the 'on or before' date. They listed that just as sort of the last-ditch 'HQ melted, devs have plague, we're being attacked by armies of rabid badgers, but it WILL be out!' date. They'll get it out late June-July I feel, assuming no actual disasters. (I'm pretty convinced of this since I think the higher-ups at Activision-while they don't really get involved in the development, I DO think they'd get involved in the shipping-will start to and lean the hell on them if it seems like it'll take them another damn year to shove something out the door and tell them to ship it the hell out the door, NOW. Can't say I'd be sad to see that, I think Blizzard might need a push this time to get something out on a sensible timeframe. They'll already be kinda late in June-July, just not disappointingly so.)</div></div><hr />

Oh come on, this expansion was a pile of garbage since they announced it at Blizzcon.

<br />
Not impressed at all. The only thing that seems to be increasing lately about Blizzard is the cost of their products.<br />
<br />
I am one of the biggest Blizzard fanboys you might ever meet. If you read the tone of my past posts you'll see I blatantly defended Blizzard in every way, no matter how outlandish their ideas were or bad moves they were prepared to do. But now for me this might be the drop that overflowed the glass. <br />
<br />
I don't want to pay more for something that might have even less content that the previous instalments.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oogly</div><div class="date">2014-03-10, 05:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The early release for prePURCHASE and ofc the price hike is yet more indicative of Blizzards financial obligations to continue to turn a profit for their investors even with diminishing revenue streams (overall sub losses trends for the last few years). <br />
<br />
They cannot from a marketing point of view over saturate the Blizz store with a new shiny pixel mount every 2-3 months anymore, and expect continued high levels of purchases from players willing to pony up the cash. Eventually even the die hard loyals will get fed up of yet another mount being shoved in their face each financial quarter. <br />
<br />
So this financial quarters marketing gimmick is getting revenue from pre purchases of an expansion that has no confirmed release date and is not even in beta yet. In addition to the revenue they squeezed out from the Iron Skyreaver, which may not have sold as well as they had initially hoped. I wonder what it will be next quarter if WoD does not indeed ship before the end of June (almost a foregone conclusion at this point).</div></div><hr />

For all u people bitching at the price, why not get a JOB, un-sub for 1/2year and play another game, rob some old woman or ask ur mommy to use her credit card again<br />
<br />
How about you think for once and realize perhaps people arent complaining about the price because they cant afford it, but because the price for an expansion has increased this time and so far feature-wise isnt even remotely justifying that increase?</div></div><hr />

Not impressed at all. The only thing that seems to be increasing lately about Blizzard is the cost of their products.<br />
<br />
I am one of the biggest Blizzard fanboys you might ever meet. If you read the tone of my past posts you'll see I blatantly defended Blizzard in every way, no matter how outlandish their ideas were or bad moves they were prepared to do. But now for me this might be the drop that overflowed the glass. <br />
<br />
I don't want to pay more for something that might have even less content that the previous instalments.<br />

Expected Game Release Fall† of 2014<br />
†Spring for Regions in Southern Hemisphere<br />

They put that date there as the definitive 'will not release later than' date.<br />
<br />
December 20 is the last day of Fall. I don't know where they mentioned Fall 2014 as a release window, but it sounds like they are using the December 20 date so they can potentially release it that late and still have released in Fall 2014 and not be liars (technically).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well I can start by saying that people will buy it, the same reason goes for why WoW has remained subscription based while SWTOR went F2P within months of its release. <br />
<br />
It's the basis for running a good business, if people are willing to pay for something then it justifies you charging for it. However if the public aren't willing to pay or lack interest in your product then you make it cheaper in the hope of attracting them.</div></div><hr />

Release window is &quot;Fall 2014,&quot; so they set the date as the last day of Fall. Because you need to have a date before you can accept pre-orders or pre-purchases. It's a common practice done by pretty much every retailer before a release date is nailed down.</div></div><hr />

I'm a poor ass student with loans out the ass and I can swing a 10 buck difference no problem. At least it isn't 60 like console games now. It was only about time, cool thing called inflation, rather them charge 10 bucks more for the xpac than raise my sub fee. <br />
<br />
As for release date oh well, not like I can do anything about it. Doubt it'll take until December though.<br />
<br />
It's not about the difference, it's about the message behind it. The shareholders need to see profits, and with WoW's descent in popularity those profits need to come from somewhere. 10 bucks a players might not be a great difference for the vast majority of players, but they know they can get away with it, much like they got away with mounts and now they will with paid boosts.<br />
<br />
Soon you'll (we'll) be paying for each tier as a separate addon and the concept of expansion will die. Mark my words. (and ofc the tier prices won't drop to reflect that)</div></div><hr />

The price is rather steep, and no doubt it will be even higher for E.U, as usual.<br />

Biggest shock to me is the proposed release date, what the hell are they smoking. They can't really afford another long period of no new content in WoW, it's madness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it has to do with the Level 90 Character Boost, I have no intentions of using it and I'd rather not pay extra for it. I know it's just $10 bucks, but considering they'll be raking in mad dough from people using the $60 service over the course of the next several months, I fail to see why everyone else has to pay more.<br />
<br />
Also, they always set the release date as &quot;on or before sometime in December&quot;. It gives them a wide birth without having to commit to a set date. Obviously, it'll be out long before that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sadly anything after june in my eyes is a failure in terms of release date. I am suspecting sept release. The problem is they have said they are further along than mop at the time of blizzcon. Yet by now we had an idea of when the beta started for MOP. still no date for WOD beta and its almost mid march. If the release isnt by August my sub will most likely be gone for good. A year of Siege is stupid especially considering they said themselves that it takes too long between final tier and new xpac and they plan to fix it.</div></div><hr />

I don't think anybody thinks the date is set in stone but it's not encouraging is it. If they would have said on or before September then I'd be a bit more understanding but giving themselves the best part of 8 1/2 months of already old content is ridiculous. If the game was going to be this far away we should have had an extra patch, it's bullshit that they have time to add cash shops and character boosts without adding new content to the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are the only one to blame here. If you buy the games when they actually come out, instead of preordering a game months before its release, you wouldn't load your credit card. Why not buy the game when they come out or when you plan to play them, not only is it more responsible &quot;financially&quot; (yes that's only $50), but it also doesn't give Blizz money up front. BTW, if you go to the restaurant, an expensive one, try to avoid paying up front, because if you end up with a crappy experience, you will only have yourself to blame for that too. Don't pre-order movie tickets that just announced its first teaser too.</div></div><hr />

I'm just not sure I see it being worth 50 bucks, if it had a new race or class, or, even a lot more dungeons and starting raids or something, but there really isn't anything that I see justifying 10$ extra. The extra 90 is whatever, since I have most characters at, or very close to max level, but adding to the cost for the bonus 90 is nonsense. Need to offer an option that doesn't include the 90 IMO.<br />
<br />
Yes I'm griping about the rise in prices, and yes I have a job. I can't see why it should cost any more than previously is all. Thought the 90 was supposed to be a freebie. Ohhhhh well :p</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every company pre-selling a product is legally obligated and required to provide a release date for it's product. This is why Game Stop and any other retailer will pull a random date out of their ass which is more often than not a far cry from the actual release date of a game you pre-order from them. This does not mean it's going to come out as late as December 20th. It doesn't say anything at all about the development progress or actual release date.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is the point I'm making, we're all going by what Blizzard has told us so no reason to take it as gospel, after Blizzcon I expected 3rd quarter (July/Aug/Sept) release but had already lost any hope of that happening. Fortunately Steam sales and PS+ have given me a whole library of games I have yet to play.<br />
<br />
For the record I've had an active EU subscription since release in Feb 2005, on top of that I've also had a second (always active) subscription since early 2008. They've both been on three-month rolling subs and both will next renew in early April, this though is the first time I've really thought about freezing both accounts. <br />
<br />
It's not some kind of personal protest since I'd rather play a polished WoD than a rushed out release, right now I just don't have much enthusiam for the next expansion and now seems as a good a time as any for me to maybe take my first forced break away from the game. What I mean by that is that I've taken breaks in the past but since the accounts have been active I always had the choice to log in if I wanted. So I'm being completely selfish here but all these delays... well for me they could all be a blessing in disguise.</div></div><hr />

Happens with so many games. Most AAA games are being sold for 60 dollar aswell as 60 euro, while 60 euro is quite abit more than 60 dollar. It's just major companies taking advtange of the stock exchange, while screwing the customers.</div></div><hr />

Sadly once it's started, you can't convince them otherwise. It was obvious the 20th wasn't the finalized date, people overreacted as usual. It was no different than if Gamestop had the release date of Dec 31st, 2014 as release. A hardened date won't be announced til it's about 3 months away from actual release.</div></div><hr />

Every expansion to date has been $40. There's no justification for them to raise it to $50 now. If we went by quality of the content seen so far, this is worth about $5 of TBC's $40.</div></div><hr />

It's not about the 10$, It's all about paying something for what is worth and to me like many other players, WoD is not adding more than MoP (imho even less) thus it should not be worth more.</div></div><hr />

Console games still cost the same as they did 8 years ago. Has nothing to do with inflation.</div></div><hr />

Considering we pay a rather hefty sub fee every month + cash shops + past expansions it's rather insulting for them to increase the fee...</div></div><hr />
