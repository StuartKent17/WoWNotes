<br />
All world bosses are now Tap to Faction. This new system offers every eligible player of the same faction that engages a boss the chance to earn loot. Under the new system, players will only be able to earn loot from each world boss once per week, but bonus rolls apply. Bosses will now respawn more frequently as well.&quot;<br />
<br />
Finally they listened to stop people from being prude.</div></div><hr />

I did not catch the lightning forge on my first look-through. Thank you for pointing this out. That, along with world bosses tapping to faction, the changes to the farm, and eternal flame getting a nice buff, I'm looking forward to this patch.</div></div><hr />

Those Monk changes look great.<br />

<br />
I look forward to seeing what that Lightning Forge can churn out. With my horrible luck of attaining a weapon even from LFR, let alone MSV normal which I've cleared a dozen times, I hope there's a decent 2Her that can be crafted.<br />
<br />
I have a feeling they'll be either ilvl 476 or 483, immediately inferior to the new raid weapons... kinda like those crafted weapons learned from the Molten Front.</div></div><hr />

ALSO:<br />
<br />
It seems that this patch will be a combination of Isle of Quel'danis (realm progression,) Ulduar (raid size,) and ToC (daily faction grind.) But with Dinosaurs.<br />

Blizzard are making a serious attempt to streamline things for the better. Not to mention improving PvP without effecting PvE so much (the Warrior's Shockwave change = brilliant).<br />
<br />
Lots of Monk changes. I think that's great, moves us a bit more away from Rogues and makes us a bit more unique. Though I see no downside with the WW shadows - unless their AI is dumb, that's a 20% damage buff straight up.<br />
<br />
And Elemental Shaman are finally getting Shamantic Rage, a small self-heal from Flame Shock, lower cooldown on Elemental Mastery... Times are good. Let's hope Elemental PvP is fun again and I might actually go back to it!</div></div><hr />

Looking at that blue post the new daily hub seems like a kind of rebirth of Isle of Quel'Danas in how you had to do dailies to finally open up Sunwell. And maybe if reading right Throne of Thunder could be like that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And are some of you daft? Design shift because of the Wrathion head enchant? Puh-lease. Regular head enchants from factions were removed because the first thing you did at 85 was to put on some fugly tabard and run 5mans over and over until revered.<br />
<br />
Only thing missing is a set of 5mans, but there are many new scenarios. It's possible that they don't want to add new 5mans because it creates the funnel effect, new 5mans has to have greater loot, so people are funneled into those as soon as they meet the gear criteria. Who did anything but HoT dungeons in 4.3?<br />

Rogue changes seem very nice as well. Especially the 30y teleport on openers.</div></div><hr />

I get that TFB was a bit overpowered (if the stars were in complete alignment. Let's be honest, the QQ about TFB was ridiculous) but the other nerfs on top of that seem pretty damn harsh. Instead of making other abilities more attractive they've blasted the good ones into the same obscurity the other abilities are in. Second Wind is good, but it wasn't so good that anyone worth a damn in pvp couldn't kill us. And lowering the rage cost of ER to 30 does not make it comparable in the least. Also, Shockwave literally requiring 3 targets to be balanced is an absolute joke. It might have some decent use in BG's but even then, it's only making the ability as decent as it used to be. It'll be pretty useless in Arena, now. Are we going back to the BC days when a healer would have to dote after us to make us viable? And why nerf the Death from Above glyph?! That hurts our PvP and PvE output. The charge tier is now pretty good all around so cudos on the Warbringer change.<br />
<br />
Blizz, you said you don't like seeing people make cookie-cutter builds out of your new system and I love that ideology, but you don't fix it by making all those popular abilities just as bad as the ones we're not picking. Players who pick these abilities are doing so because they are usually the clear choice in whatever form of play they partake in so you need to bring the others up a bit to compensate, not cut them down. How about give ER some temp damage output (3-5%?). If you're going to take away some of our AoE/burst/rotational output with the DFA glyph, how about giving that back to us in some other form, like, more damage to a high-cost instant attack? My main concern is my PvE output taking a hit by that. This glyph made Heroic Leap a rotational ability which I found to be quite fun. You beta tested Mists with this in mind so now, without it, our dps will suffer.<br />
<br />
Sorry if this sounds whiny but these nerfs seem excessive in the current metagame. The rest of the patch notes make me pretty excited. I won't quit or stop playing my warr despite these nerfs. We've been through this many, many times. It's still early and untested so I'll take it with a grain of salt, but still - better to get my 2 copper in now than later.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully the second color is the easiest to obtain for a non pvp focused player. Also when I read there is an unlockable ship yard I immediately though of owning our own ships. A pipe dream but what wow needs is some good old fashion sailing. Maybe it gives us a deep sea fishing area.<br />
<br />
5.2 sounds pretty awesome. The zandalari war party sounds like the scourge invasion. But with trolls. Sort of dynamic events all the time. So instead of deathwing attacking a zone its a bunch of stuff you can actually fight. Awesome. 5.2 can't come soon enough and we haven't even got to experience the stuff.</div></div><hr />

I am glad to hear Fire is getting a minor buff in aoe with the changes to glyph of Inferno Blast.<br />
Invocation Talent change is great. The uptime will recover for the 10% damage loss imo.<br />
Arcane will be still viable as it didn't get any nerfs. The only thing Arcane Mages will have to change is the playstyl as it will be much harder to maintain 6 charges up at all times with the increased mana cost in AB and Scorch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizz loves to back pedal<br />
<br />
There is no back pedaling going on with the head enchants. They removed them because people complained about having to grind out rep for more or less no reason than to get the head enchants that were pretty much required equipment.<br />
<br />
These head enchants are part of the Wrathion quest chain. If you're not working on your legendary weapon and think that suddenly NOW you have to start working on it because the quest has a head enchant then A) your priorities are really, really, really weird and B) you're not in any position for the head enchant to make one bit of difference, anyway.<br />

They've already said they're not getting rid of the daily quest rep for the ones currently in game, so there's not going to be any retroactive rep changes, but they've added a new way to get free rep(Farm &quot;dailies&quot; to grow a particular crop on your farm) on top of your dailies and the new rep is only gained by killing mobs inside the new raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could make a solid case that every one of those is the worst set ever. I've never seen a tier be so ugly from start to finish. I usually just assume an armor set isn't for me because people a whole lot more talented than I am put a whole lot of work into the art for the tier sets, but this entire tier is just awful. The Druid set is decent in a &quot;haunted forest&quot; sort of way, but I wouldn't wear any of the tier sets as they are now.</div></div><hr />

There is no hate I can assure you, I love the game and I love the company, I am just wondering where the innovation is to come from as last few expansions have featured very similar dynamics and it would be nice to see some changes to you know.. the world of Warcraft? I think next expansion they will admit they strayed too far off the path and that they will return to the roots of the game (and this is why we play right?) because I don't see it any more. I and many others continuously do not like the direction they are taking the game in and it's a fair viewpoint which all are entitled to seeing as we spent so many days, months and years in the game.</div></div><hr />

It may be due to that indeed :-)<br />
<br />
You are 50% correct, if a group from your faction starts to attack a world boss, you only need to whack away on it too, and you will be able to receive loot (Once per week) and you don't have to be in the group which &quot;tagged&quot; the boss<br />

In my opinion, no class should have more than two major cooldowns. It just gets annoying. As enhancement I've got 5 DPS cooldowns (including Heroism), which is ridiculous. (I'm speaking of PvE) Add to that all the situational totems you may or may not have to use. And that's with taking minimum amount of active talents. I liked how assassination rogues only had Vendetta (and the overall simplicity of the spec, too). Got slightly annoyed when they added three new cooldowns. That being shadow blades (can't remember name), group stealth and improved stealth. Granted, I won't have to use the latter two a lot, so not all that bad, I thought. Now we're gonna be &quot;forced&quot; to deal with Preparation as well. Those abilities are just awkward. A cooldown to reset cooldowns? Why not just reduce the cooldown of the spells?</div></div><hr />

the other really cool thing about the new Isle of Q dailies is that the progress is shared by the realm, which means even if you hate dailies, people who like them (like me) can open up the rewards for you anyway.<br />

I think ive seen it a few times now that they have no intentions on adding any during MoP, they want players to progress with Raid Finder now to catch up :/<br />

Um.. no, they weren´t talking about heroic dungeons, they were talking about new valor gear with every patch. There won´t be full sets of valor gear introduced, if you need to catch up, you are supposed to run LFR.</div></div><hr />

I kinda disagree. For people who don´t raid other than LFR, they do a lot of heroics to cap VP, and they ARE old and very very easy. If we add another level of LFR gear onto our characters, current heroics are going to be soloable. Already with heroics I tell my healers to just dps, as a bear tank I don´t need heals on most of them.<br />
<br />
There is a lot of content in this patch so I can´t complain, but I would have liked to see 3 heroic dungeons that maybe drop blue ilvl 483 gear.</div></div><hr />

considering chaos bolt has been nerfed once already, and now this is twice. On top of Blood Fear nerf, soul leech nerf, and felhunter nerf, I think it is safe to say that Blizzard at least follows its trend of nerfing warlocks.<br />

Relevant to this, the weapons from Molten Front were superior to T11 reg weapons, but not as good as T11 heroic, so bearing that in mind, I'd presume the new weapons to likely be something around i-level 503, halfway between reg and heroic. Or at least as good as the weapons from the later T14 content, at 496, making them a half step better than the MSV reg weapons.</div></div><hr />

Going back to the old model where you have to progress linear through the raids from release of current expac?<br />
That's the plan. We have older Raid Finder tiers now to provide the necessary gear.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's plans for going back to the TBC raiding model had even been stated before that, but unfortunately I'm unable to locate the post.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Regarding Heirlooms<br />
- Do we have to get a complete new set of Heirlooms or are they upgrading current ones?<br />
They're basically the same items, but will go up to 85 instead. Blizzard is not upgrading the old 80 versions, so you will have to buy the heirlooms again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
when blizzard can nerf pvp without hitting pve we raiders will stop crying<br />
<br />
<br />
I actually have to agree with this, it's ridiculous how a proper buff to PVE cannot happen without a flood of tears about burst damage, heals or OP tanks. While I understand that stuff is annoying I cannot help but scoff because when WoW was launched PVP outside of World PVP did not exist. So I find it ludicrous that they try to &quot;Balance&quot; PVE around a mini game that they decided to try and integrate into the game.<br />
<br />
Yes PVP has a huge following now, yes it's becoming fairly popular but it doesn't change the fact it was an addition like pet battles yet the only difference is pet battles doesn't mess up the main focus of the game by causing nerfs due to massive QQ. They need to stop trying to keep the two blended and separate PVP and PVE as much as possible. From the skills you can use while &quot;Flagged&quot; for PVP clear down to the servers them selves. They also need to add in an option to opt out for auto flagging like they have in rift. Sure you can't attack guards but that is a small price you pay for not having to worry about getting flagged by some moron who decides to flag and stand on top of an NPC just to get you flagged and killed.</div></div><hr />

Speaking as someone who plays Alliance on a Horde dominated(89% to 11% according to WoW Census, which is usually right give or take 4-5%) realm, I think it's an awful idea. I've never even SEEN Galleon(who this change is obviously intended for, as well as future Galleon-type world bosses. Seeing as Sha respawns every 15 minutes and nobody gives a crap about not tagging him anymore) up, but the very idea that I could be questing in the area and run up and hit him with one ability and die, then let the group do all the work and kill him so I can collect my epics is just dumb.</div></div><hr />

I am glad to hear Fire is getting a minor buff in aoe with the changes to glyph of Inferno Blast.<br />
Invocation Talent change is great. The uptime will recover for the 10% damage loss imo.<br />
Arcane will be still viable as it didn't get any nerfs. The only thing Arcane Mages will have to change is the playstyl as it will be much harder to maintain 6 charges up at all times with the increased mana cost in AB and Scorch.<br />
<br />
A spec that is about mana getting increased mana cost on it's nuke and you can say with a straight face that it is not a nerf? Seriously lad you are hilarious.</div></div><hr />

I agree. After millions leave we can get past this foolish design paradigm and move onto something better hopefully. Then you can go on to agree with that decision to and tell players who don't like it to leave. Blizzard is the luckiest company in the universe.

Yeah, because Cataclysm showed us how long players last when every patch makes you almost instantly ready for the new tier. When factions were nothing but an ugly tabard. When 5mans gave you everything you needed to progress.<br />
<br />
If this, scenarios, factions that matter, reasonably gated valor items, lesser charms, tier LFR, is foolish design and doomed to fail, then I'll just acknowledge that players no longer want WoW to be anything like an MMO, they want to farm 5mans, clear one raid then stand in their respective major city. They don't want to progress their characters, more than reaching a weekly reset or valor limit.<br />
<br />
Because doing dailies now and then is so horrible. With actual rewards too, not only some ugly mounts a la BC factions, where no one but hardcores had any decent looking mount, gee I wonder what made people do those stale dailies that never shifted.<br />
<br />
No Tony, millions will not leave due to MoPs design. But they might do it in time because the game is older than the mental age of some forumites. Aimed at no one in particular.<br />

I dont know what do you want with MAGE class. At the beggining you put the mage on top... and NOW... Well we've just seeing nerf and nerf and nerf. <br />
<br />
In resume we have:<br />
<br />
1. Invocation --&gt; losing spell power with 25% to 15% damage and 50% less passive mana regeneration ...<br />
2. Scorch --&gt; Additional cost of mana incriese to 3.5% ...<br />
3. Frostbolt --&gt; No longer increases subsequent Frostbolt damage ...<br />
4. Arcane Blast --&gt; Increased mana cost to 1.6667% ... <br />
<br />
I saw many ppls talking about the fire mage nerf and a comment that we should try play as arcane/frost mage and pratically forget fire, BUT with this, I'm thinking what do you want when you nerf the mainly and pratically unique skills that the Mage use, even Fire, Frost or Arcane?</div></div><hr />

That was all needed to stem the bleeding from the gaping wound Tier 11 caused with its attempt to re-institute artificial gating by social stratification. And frankly it worked. People aren't going to be satisfied with Mogu Karazhan and LFR. It's going to happen all over again.</div></div><hr />
