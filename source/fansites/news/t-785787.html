The design for combat resurrection effects has changed a good deal for Cataclysm, and we want to make sure players are clear on how spells like Rebirth and Create Soulstone now function. Rebirth has a 10-minute cooldown and Create Soulstone has a 15-minute cooldown. On raid boss encounters, you can only use one of these combat resurrection spells (so one Rebirth or one Soulstone) per attempt for 10-player raids. For 25-player raids you can use three forms of combat resurrection per raid boss attempt (so three of any combination of Rebirth and Soulstone). The count is incremented as soon as a player accepts a resurrection, so one can always choose not to accept if he or she wants someone else to get the resurrection instead. There is no equivalent of the Sated debuff (which tracks Bloodlust/Heroism usage), but you will get an error message if you try to resurrect too many players, and we might add tracking to our raid interface if there is demand for it. Outside of raid content, you can use as many battle resurrections as you have available.<br />
<br />
For those of you currently participating in the World of Warcraft: Cataclysm beta test, please note that this functionality may not be fully implemented as of yet. If you notice combat resurrections are not currently functioning as explained here, this is just a heads-up about the updated design intent behind them. <br />
<br />
Unless Soulstone is being changed, why does the harder to use combat rez (that being Soulstone, since you have to predict ahead of time who to Soulstone) have the longer cooldown?<br />
One thing we're considering with Soulstone is making it possible, in addition to its current functionality, to be cast on a dead player to give them the option of joining the living again. <br />

New Community Site Live Preview<br />
Looks like we won't be the only one with a new design this week. The new community site is live and is very similar to the one launched with Starcraft 2.<br />
http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/27607270963/new-community-site-live-preview/]Many[/url] exciting changes are coming to World of Warcraft with the upcoming Cataclysm expansion, both in-game and out. We're excited to offer you an early look at the new World of Warcraft community site, which will soon become the prime gathering spot and source of information for players on the web. You can read more about the transition from our existing website to the new one in our original announcement: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=27387366608&amp;sid=1<br />

<br />
Completly disagree. This change was need, as raids with only 1 lock and 2 druids were really penelised compared to one with 4 druids and 2 lock.<br />
<br />
Battle rez is too powerfull at his current state (the number of times will killed the boss only thanks to a healer being Brez is good example of that)</div></div><hr />

So if a reg fight is actually requiring brez to get through it, i don't think we should nerf brez but rather examine what is causing this to be required in the fight.I mean if brez was that important they would be dished out to every healer like normal rez...THEN they would have cause for legitemate concern.</div></div><hr />

I've been a bit worried about that too. Soon we might end up with the same abilities for every class: /cast &quot;damage bolt&quot;, perfomrm &quot;melee attack&quot;, /cast &quot;heal spell&quot; or /cast &quot;threat ability&quot;<br />

<br />
Your on track in the first part, its too stop stacking the deck. If a fight requires a brez to get through it then the fight is not tuned properly. A brez should be for fixing screw ups, not a requirement to finish an encounter. Like, someone's computer freezing or such.</div></div><hr />

Armory was really slow for me, but the new site is fast and the design improvements look great.<br />
<br />
Probably one of the reasons they are making the change with combat res is what many high end raiding guilds would do. They would have everyone in their guild level a warlock alt till they got soulstone so they could each have one for their H LK attempts etc.<br />
<br />
As far as homogenizing, a lot of it is needed. First off, 10 mans are supposed to be tuned for having every buff/debuff available, so now you aren't gimped because you don't have a Shaman and miss out on heroism etc. Same with combat res, now if your only Druid dies, the lock can (hopefully they change it to this) pick him back up. Making many of the buffs/debuffs overlap does not change how your class works, so stop crying that the sky is falling. A Mage is still nothing like a Warlock.<br />
<br />
The only 2 places things are much closer now is tanking and healing, and it is a good thing. Guilds can focus on player skill instead of what class they play (to an extent). You shouldn't be gimped because you don't have a holy pally or a disc priest because they should all be able to fill the same roles, yet their playstyle and flavor is different enough that you don't feel like it's playing the same class.</div></div><hr />

Only unique left is disc priest with shields nobody else can bring to raid. Tanks were similar during WotLK, but if everything will work as Blizzard promises in Catalsym, they will be the same class with different textures and spell names. Yes, you may feel different by controlling warrior and DK, but as healer or rl I'll see you just the same class. It sucks so hard, I may even try Star Wars then it'll get to the public :)</div></div><hr />

Sometimes we used up to 10 in one fight. Strategy like to kill person with Professor's plague and rez him was awesome. And that was a part of the game. Less possibilities = more common friendly.<br />
<br />
If you are specifically using brez or soulstone to get around a mechanic in an encounter, whether or not Blizzard intended you to do this, is one thing. Its another for hardcore guilds to bring in 10 druids and 15 warlocks (exaggeration I know) to their raid so that they can ignore stupidity while learning the fight. This also goes for pugs and bad raiding guilds who only were able to get down Sindragosa after using 4 druids in their 10 man.<br />
<br />
I can see the argument that it's homogenizing by only being able to use one soulstone OR brez, but if they only locked out one of those spells then these aforementioned groups would just stack the other class even further.<br />
<br />
It's a blow to both casual and hardcore raiders, but honestly after how easy it was in WotLK to not be held accountable for your actions, I welcome any change that makes the bad players in a group more obvious.</div></div><hr />

It probably doesn't. Since Ankh is a self res only it's much harder to abuse. (Queue the stacked ten man raid with all Shammy healers and DPS ;-))</div></div><hr />

Second if you are dieing and needing Brez's all the time, it means your doing something wrong and you to change up your strat... There has been plenty of times where we have had to kill a boss with 1 less, so it shouldn't be that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
And if your talking about class uniqueness, from what I see Warlocks and Druids are the only ones &quot;still&quot; with BRez. So thinking that this is to make things more &quot;bring the player&quot;, your kinda wrong on this. It just means you have to make sure you do better then you are, instead relying on that Brez. God knows how many times in raids I hear the leader give out BRez assignments BEFORE the raid begins because we either aren't ready for the fight or we just don't know what we are doing...<br />
<br />
So I personally think its a great idea, and people should do there part rather then doing something like pull hate, or stand in fire. A lot of the raids have that one moron that doesn't seem to grasp the fight and hopefully this will make him try that much harder.<br />

No and no. All Your arguments are wrong. The change has nothing to do with raid composition in terms of tanks,dps and healing, but in terms of classes stacks. And knowing when to save your cooldowns for is something that fits perfect in the game mechanics. The armor type example is completly bad, that is been changed for loot distribution purposes, nothing to do with homogenization. Learn to play, then be good at, then try and post again.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, especially the armor thing. As a guild officer, I got tired of being involved in battles between plate users and leather users over loot. (The worst was a pally healer who had LOST the roll and wondered why he couldn't have the gear, thinking we were denying him it because it was leather.) And there is no homogenization involved in knowing you have a limited number of chances to recover from a mistake via battle rez, it actually encourages skill and thought. My raid leader has a bad habit of firing off battle rezzes for the first DPS who dies, instead of saving it for a time of greater need, because it's so readily available. This isn't about homogenization at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would prefer it be:<br />
<br />
10m - single brez, single soulstone<br />
25m - two brez, two soulstone<br />
<br />
Because if you think about it, the soulstone is better when you are learning an encounter and the Druid(s) may already be dead. <br />
<br />
Just my opinion.<br />
<br />
Also, as per the Shaman Ankh: I am very surprised this wasn't included. Being a Resto Shaman I can certianly see how the other healers would see our Ankh as an unfair advantage. I'd rather have them add restrictions to ankh per raid fight than nerf the spell to the point is useless. However, compared to brez and soulstone it does have a fairly long cooldown, and would not be availiable every attempt (even every other attempt would be iffy).<br />
<br />
As per homogenization: I am okay with most homogenization of common tools, but I am not a fan of when an active spell/ability is equal to a passive one. I have pretty much stopped dropping any totems except for Healing Stream in raids. There is no point to the others, the other classes use them for virtually free (battle shout, horn of winter, arcane intellect's new %sp increas, etc.</div></div><hr />

They are getting to the point that they might as well just say screw it you pick you race and then choose Tank, melee, ranged DPS, or heals... <br />

Yes, as many of you have already noticed, we've started these forums with a clean slate in regards to forum suspensions and bans :)<br />

However, we will take posting histories into account if we need to consider a future suspension.<br />

This statement was brought on by a cap on the number of brez per attempt? This is a talent that only gets used when things go wrong, Its should not impact a raid much to any greater extent that just making another boss attempt won't cover. if you need to brez more then 3 people its more then likely having the extra 1+ brez off cooldown are going to be useful for your next boss fight/attempt anyway...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
and the person who has the soulstone might not die, so that argument is a wash. It's better to have a set # of battle rezzes rather than a number for each type. The soulstone makes you determine who will get the battle rez before the encounter, the druid battle rez lets you determine who will get it after the fact. <br />
<br />
So you can still soulstone your 'YOU MUST STAY ALIVE' targets ahead of time, and if something unplanned happens, you can druid rez, if you have any available. Blizzard's solution is a good one, it gives plenty of flexibility while still preventing abuse via class stacking</div></div><hr />

Wow, their new site is awesome. They've integrated the armory, and you can actually see reforged gear.<br />
<br />
Example: http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/bronzebeard/chasingsol/advanced<br />
<br />
Can't see the point of a dedicated armory site anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
How do you get that shadowy effect on yours? Mine looks bland compared.<br />
I believe characters, whose models weren't yet cached by the site, are displayed with this effect.</div></div><hr />

First off its bad because most guilds farm hard content with at least 1 or 2 battle rezzes mid-fight, its just part of the game for people to make mistakes. On the other hand, its VERY GOOD because it teaches people not to make those mistakes and imo weaves out a LOT of the casuals from downing content a long time before more hardcore players. Also it should be 4 rezzes for 25 man and 2 for 10 man. who doesnt have that one dps that dies mid-way through the fight, u brez him/her, then a healer dies and no brezzes left. 2 just seems about right for 10.</div></div><hr />

It sounds needlessly complicated, and I thought with Cata blizzard wanted to get rid of everything needlessly complicated and obscure numbers. Plus, I never saw combatresses or soulstones as OP for the past few years, the proper use of them was exactly what was making it exciting and fun (that includes the decision to use or to not to use because of the long CD). I mean just get rid of the mechanism alltogether instead.<br />
<br />
That said, how will soulstones work in Cata? Like they do today? Because I mean today they're always on the wrong person anyway. Soulstone the healer who keeps dying every time and he's bound to survive the next 5 tries but you'll have another healer die instead now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is setting a limit to prevent a raid group from stacking the group with battle rezzes &quot;systematically killing casual play&quot; as you put it? If you're in a self-labeled &quot;casual guild&quot; that employs this method just to scrape by on regular endgame content then I have news for you, you're not in a casual guild, you're in a bad a raiding guild that's stacking rezzes to overcompensate for poor play and error mitigation.<br />
<br />
Funny how it's mostly the same crowd that complained that &quot;Wrath was TOO EASY&quot; that is whining now that Blizzard apparently has the pendulum swinging the other way with Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

Have you seen what they're doing with tanks? They all might as well be the same thing. And Death Knights don't have a tree choice anymore. And unless you're an elemental shaman, the dps rotations are getting really convoluted.<br />
<br />
I liked the days when it was more rock-paper-scissors. I loved kiting paladins with ranged classes until they got the stuns and ranged attacks...</div></div><hr />

/agree. Raiding with a 'lock and druid resulted in soulstone being put on the druid(s) 99.9 percent of the time because the droods could b-res. With the limited number, that's not going to be the case anymore. well...at least in 10mans.</div></div><hr />
