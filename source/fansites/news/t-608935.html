Update : Registrations for MLG 3v3 Tournament in Orlando (http://www.mlgpro.com/2008pccircuit/index) on July 11/12/13 are now open ! More about it in an upcoming news. The tournament will feature a full 32-team double elimination tournament, with three-versus-three teams competing for $31,500 in cash and prizes, including 3 HP Blackbird 002 Gaming PCs valued at $3000 each.<br />
<br />
We definitely have a LOT of stuff today, Patch 2.4.3 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=8979.0) is still being tested on PTRs and Blizzard plans to add premade characters to them in the near future. <br />

PTR 2.4.3 FAQ and Premades<br />
Hortus answered a few questions about the Patch 2.4.3 on PTRs (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=8979.0) and also confirmed that premades are on the way. <br />
Premades<br />
Yes we plan on having premades for this test phase. No I do not know when they will be available. Post about them will be deleted.<br />
<br />
Season 4<br />
This test phase is not intended for testing Season 4. Season 4 gear was already tested in a previous PTR phase. According to Eyonix post in the general forum Season 4 will most likely be available on the retail realms well before 2.4.3 goes live.<br />
<br />
Authentication update<br />
The PTR authentication servers were updated today June 18th. This means that if you account was active today you will be eligible for the PTR. Likewise the password your account has today will be the only password available on the PTR. If your account is not Burning Crusade enabled as of today you will not be able to use Premade characters when they become available.<br />

Amount of items dropped by Eredar Twins &quot;increased&quot;<br />
The Eredar Twins just had a difference of opinion that has been resolved. They will now drop the version with the increased number of items regardless of who dies first. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=7116579218&amp;pageNo=2&amp;sid=1#20))<br />

Will the price of lvl 60 ground mount be lowered in the future ?<br />
We have no current plans, but of course anything can change as we get closer to launching Wrath of the Lich King. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=7116400066&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#7))<br />
<br />
Curse of Elements changes<br />
This change isn't intended to add new functionality like Nature and Holy but simply combine the spells instead. In the future it's possible we will make additional changes to Curse of Elements along these lines, but we will have to wait and see. Right now we don't plan to plan to change things up too much but combining the spells felt like a good improvement to try out for patch 2.4.3. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=7116639528&amp;pageNo=4&amp;sid=1#78))<br />
<br />
WotLK Alpha Accounts can't access PTRs<br />
Thanks for the report Elzix. It looks like accounts flagged for the Lich King Alpha can not see the realm list, this caused me quite a bit of confusion myself. We'll look into it, but you might have to limit yourself to Northrend for this testing phase.

Can you get a refund of your lvl 40 mount if you bought it before the patch ?<br />
As with most changes to the game, we will not be offering refunds for any characters who purchase, or have purchased a standard mount prior to patch 2.4.3. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=7116599648&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#13))<br />

40 man raid in Wrath of the Lich King / Arthas Encounter<br />
We currently have no plans to add a 40-player dungeon into Wrath of the Lich King. We fully anticipate making the 10 and 25-player dungeons and raids challenging as a part of their progression. <br />
<br />
You can say what you like about whether or not a 10-player dungeon is truly challenging if you wish, but they take coordination and require each player to play their role to their best ability to succeed.<br />
<br />
When it comes to whether or not Arthas will be epic enough, we are working to maintain the epic feel of the encounter and have been discussing ways of doing this that should be appropriate. One idea that has been talked about was whether or not it would require a 25-player group to defeat Arthas before it ever opens up to 10-player groups.

The Midsummer Fire Festival Begins<br />
Each summer, the arrival of the Midsummer Fire Festival (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/events/midsummer/) signals a time of merriment and a chance to revel in the hottest season of the year by lighting celebratory bonfires across the land and sharing in what the elemental spirits have to offer. This year (beginning tomorrow and continuing until July 5), the festival features some brand-new events, quests, and prizes, including a special summoned boss for groups of high-level players. Learn more about the new Midsummer Fire Festival content in our updated page (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/events/midsummer/), which also includes a new screenshot gallery (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/events/midsummer/gallery.html). Once the event begins, submit your screenshots of Festival fun here (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/community/submission/screenshot-form.html).<br />
Below is a part of the guide from the official site with a few improvements. <br />
<br />
Type: Holiday Event<br />
Date: June 21 - July 4<br />
Location: Azeroth and Outland <br />
<br />
Tending the Flames<br />
Across Azeroth, brilliant bonfires have been lit to signify the hottest months of the year. The chosen Flamekeepers are eager to ensure they continue burning long into the days and nights of the celebration - and they seek the aid of able explorers in doing so. Traverse the land and delve into dangerous dungeons at their behest. You may return hot, sweaty, and a little sooty...but these spiritual guides understand well the need to reward adventurers beyond the promise of &quot;enlightenment.&quot; <br />
<br />
Burning Blossoms<br />
[item=23247] are the currency used for the Fire Festival and are used to purchase seasonal reward items from Midsummer Suppliers and Merchants. You can collect [item=23247] by completing quests, including the daily quests that are part of the festival. Using them near a Fire Festival Bonfire also grants a temporary but useful buff to your character, or reignites an extinguished bonfire - but consumes the blossom in the process.<br />

Ahune, the Frost Lord<br />
One of the main additions to the Fire Festival this year is a new summonable boss. Level 70 players can undertake this questline that takes you to the Slave Pens to seek and defeat Ahune, the Frost Lord. Ahune is a special summonable boss, similar to the Headless Horseman, that is only available during the Fire Festival. Luma Cloudsister, located just inside the Slave Pens, directs your party to where you can find and defeat Ahune - and loot his special rewards. The loot in Heroic mode is more powerful than on normal mode and includes epic items. <br />
<br />
Lord Ahune (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=25740) is a new Headless-horseman-like boss, you will be able to fight him during the Midsummer Festival (June 21 - July 4) and after a small fight he might reward you with a few epics. This is a daily quest and you'll be able to summon him once a day just like the Headless Horseman.<br />
<br />
Phase 1 - The boss spawns two types of adds and you can't really damage him, just take care of the adds and after a minute, Ahune will go into phase 2.<br />
Phase 2 - Ahune submerges (ragnaros-style) and its Frozen Core will spawn, that's when you attack him ! After some time Ahune will emerge and you'll have to fight adds for one more minute, etc ...<br />

End of Arena Season 3 - Reward Requirements<br />
More information about season 4 rewards and gear requirements can be found in this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=8672.0).<br />
With season 4 coming on June 25th, we want to remind everyone about the requirements for individuals and teams to be eligible for the end of season rewards.<br />
<br />
Teams will need to meet both of the following requirements to be counted and considered as potential recipients of any rewards. A team that does not meet these requirements will not be counted, and will not be factored in to the reward distribution percentages. The requirements for a team to be counted are as follows:<br />
The team must have played at least 20 games during the season.<br />
The team must have at least one player that has played in 20% or more of the total games for that team.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If a team is counted and is able to receive rewards, the requirements for a player on that team to be eligible to receive them are as follows:<br />
The player must have played in 20% or more of the total games for that team.<br />
The player must have a Personal Rating that is not more than 100 points lower than the Team Rating (your Personal Rating may be higher, however).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Good luck to all of those competing for top honors! <br />

<br />
That means there is one, and precisely one, class in the entire game for which it does absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Obviously +35 Agility is probably better anyway. But still…it hurts being left out again, just like with the Zul'Aman charms.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just like hunter scopes do precicely nothing for melee. As soon as scopes boost melee damage you can start to complain about imbalance.</div></div><hr />

I can guarantee you every hunter here would take two ranged mongoose enchants over two 20 agility enchants. As soon as there is a non-passive enchant on melee weapon that activates on ranged attack you can start to complain about imbalance.</div></div><hr />

info on deathfrost: IT APPLIES TO BOSSES<br />
and it got a 50% procchance, 8s duration, 20s internal cooldown<br />
holy carp, we were happy when we found that out.. 15% slower melee-attacks or spells on any raidboss you want</div></div><hr />

<br />
Put out enemy fires for 10 Burning Blossom.<br />
Honor allied fires for 5 Burning Blossom.<br />
