<br />
Think its more because brawlers guild isn't a instanced thing so they wanna limit the amount of people doing it at any given time do to the fact people would be waiting hours to have there turn.....honestly think they should have just made it instanced or phased and maybe when you walk in you get a random person to watch with multiple queues per phase or something.</div></div><hr />

It bothers me that Blizzard is nerfing blood dks in this way. I've been asked to do RBGs a few times and carry the flag. I've had a lot of fun with it. It concerns me that they are basically going to stop my viability as a flag carrier in rbgs/bgs etc. I don't really see this being the solution. Maybe reduce the blood shield that you get but not the healing. I just think it's a knee jerk reaction to a lot of whining.</div></div><hr />

Demonic Gateway's duration has been increased to 20 15 minutes, and it will no longer despawn if the Warlock moves too far away. In addition, this ability can no longer be used in any capital city.<br />
<br />
A New Major Glyph has been added: Glyph of Supernova. This glyph will cause the Warlock to deal 10% of his maximum health to all targets within 5 yards for each Burning Ember he had when he was slain.<br />

All of these notes have strikethroughs that are missing.</div></div><hr />

You mean people who pay the same amount of money every month, for the content blizz is developing. those people.<br />
<br />
<br />
The brawlers thing is a nice idea, it won't work. It's blizz's way of avoiding using a decent spectator mode (something guild wars 1 [all those years ago] did fantastically well).<br />
<br />
So it'll be one fight at a time rather than phased (although the mobs will be phased in and out - which lead to a few breaks and bugs in it on the PTR).<br />
<br />
-yawn- if i wanted to see guilds watch their own members measure their **** size. I'd go down to the pub.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean we live in a world of youtube, why would we want to watch that anyway. Considering it's a new faction... i don't know the black auction house is a nice addition but in this instance... nah... this will be changed. Blizz caters for the masses not the few wannabe no lifers whose only experience of women is from a book they borrowed from their moms</div></div><hr />

Actually, that makes some sense. Maybe it's a daily rep grind that in the end a NPC will invite you or you can OPTIONALLY buy it from the bmah? That might be cool if its something like that.</div></div><hr />

You must have missed the deep freeze, frost bomb and ring of frost nerfs then? And when were mages able to cast 7+ pyros in a 5 sec (soon 4) stun? Don't talk when you know 0...

NOPE, you're making up things that they never mentioned, as invites being a bypass, when the notes specifically state that's the ONLY way in.<br />
And Guilds have guild money and people loaded. They can control who get the invitation of BMAH and who their people invite. So, YOU missed the point. Player Guilds will control the entrance to the Brawler's Guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Short term, it'll have a positive affect on those who cannot join. The regular Joe who isn't wealthy or in the right guild won't have a chance to compete for the Realm First achievement and will keep the queue times low because of this. However, it won't be like this forever and eventually more and more people will gain access, increasing queues, and creating more community frustrations for Blizzard which will either lead to more locations such as Arenas or implement a phased system. <br />
<br />
Either way, most are mad about the immediate problem of gating content to the fewer wealthy players rather than the long term situation of everyone accepted to the Guild getting screwed by the current structure of this feature.</div></div><hr />

Yes the path notes say invites off the BMAH or from SOMEONE within the guild are the only way in but please show me where it says the word 'players' and I will agree with the rest of you that such a system is a bad idea, because it is, but right now I believe that the way people believe it will work is not the system they plan to have.</div></div><hr />

For me, the Brawler's guild is one of the main features of 5.1. Yet, there might be a change i can't play it... <br />
I understand that Blizzard wants to make content avaiable for different type of players, but why lock out a whole group of players for content that they pay for? <br />
Why don't you make it somehow like you did with the raiding difficulties ( Raid Finder for Casual Players, Heroic Raiding for Hardcore players) offering the Casual and Hardcore different modes, fights and rewards. <br />
And if the problem is long queues, make it time based or something, like you can queue once in a few hours.<br />
Off course there is not much information yet, but doing anything with the Black market sounds like challenging against big guild moneymakers, AH players and people that buy their gold. There ain't no Brawling skill in that! :P <br />
And while in the end more people can pay the invite it still makes no use for others to wait for content like this. It's what the solo aspect of the game was lacking- Challenge(apart from soloing old raids and dungeons), and that Challenge can be found in the Brawler's Guild. So, why do you let the players wait for content while it might risk canceling a subscription? (sorry for grammar)</div></div><hr />

I think Feng is the only 100% single target fight. Gara'jal is if you're staying outside all the time. Elegon has like a few seconds of worthless adds, and Spirit Kings has a few spells which needs targetting, like the skull and the arrows. I haven't gone into the Heart of Fear yet, but isn't Zor'lok and Ta'yak purely single target?<br />

<br />
I don't think it's going to work that way. That would defeat the entire purpose of it being an exclusive thing. It would seem that the invitation to it is character exclusive. This Brawler's Guild, like the Challenge Modes, isn't intended for everyone to be in i don't think, at first anyway.<br />
<br />
When it says &quot;invitation by someone in the guild&quot; i think it means by an NPC that is part of it, i don't think it will be as simple as having a guild member in your guild that is in the Brawler's Guild passing out invites. I think it's going to take some form of &quot;achievement&quot; type thing that will be &quot;noticed&quot; by an NPC in the Brawler's Guild and you'll get an invite in the mail.</div></div><hr />

pretty sure an invite from someone within the guild means the brawlers guild, not sure if this means a player in the brawlers guild or an NPC in the brawlers guild.<br />

You don't even know if you have to actually pay large amount of gold to get invited stupid!

It says &quot;on the BMAH,&quot; not &quot;at the Tavern in the Mists,&quot; pretty obviously means buying it.<br />
What &quot;or by invitation from somebody within the guild&quot; means is anyone's guess. Could be quest chain, could be rep, could be invites from other players that get price gouged. But apparently you know exactly what it is and everyone else is an idiot</div></div><hr />

But, uh, what's the spread between 1st and 16th? I mean, SOMEONE has to be first and last, and they all have to be spread somewhere. if the difference is 1k, who cares except for idiots? If the spread is 20k, then I would agree,<br />
