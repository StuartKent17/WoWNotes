<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cirque</div><div class="date">2011-05-04, 11:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why Blizzard insists that acquiring aggro should be fun is beyond me. It's not. Maintaining aggro should be the goal, not acquiring. I don't want to make the raid suffer so much more when I tank adds on Maloriak just because Icy Touch doesn't outthreat healers, they're immune to death grip and, next patch, rune strike won't even help me build some solid short term threat to at LEAST get it away from near the boss before I can work on it. Not to mention the amount of damage I take extra for the class that I am and the stuns I have not. x.x And what's worse, once you finally have them in place you can snooze off again because you don't need to work for your threat after that, just for your survival by hitting death strike or however your class works.<br />
<br />
It's just.. Yeah. It's like they're completely lost with their threat thing. It's become one huge experiment that changes every patch. For every class. I'd like to be tank as main, but at the same time I'm really glad I'm not with how clunky it feels now with this whole &quot;threat at start is a bitch, threat later on in the fight is /afkfest&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, I think they did the same thing with bear tanks and simply compensated with increased damage on the abilities. So, hopefully, we'll get increased damage which would be nice anyway.</div></div><hr />

It's only in Frost spec. As it triggers from dodges and parries (I think both).<br />
Only in Blood spec is it fully available, it'll keep it's threat in that one.</div></div><hr />

Rune Strike now scales from 18% of AP, up from 15%. No longer causes a high amount of threat.<br />

For DKs, it's Frost spec only, do not worry about it.<br />

<br />
No, Rune Strike is considered a Frost ability, even for Blood Tanks. The &quot;Frost&quot; in the patch notes just denotes the category of spell it is, not the presence that is affected.<br />
<br />
It would seem that Blizzard has changes in mind for all tanks on how they generate threat. The question is if Blizzard wants to address tanks currently not having to stress about aggro management at all, or if they have other plans to help tanks maintain more aggro in the next tier of raiding where DPS will be even more bamf.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't mean its Frost Spec only. That means that the spell is in the Frost tree, which Rune Strike is.<br />
<br />
All Rune Strikes are losing the threat modifier.</div></div><hr />

This. Honestly, they could be doing something as simple as removing the wording &quot; ... causes a high amount of threat...&quot; from ALL spell tooltips, without actually changing the threat generation of the abilities. This is dataminded stuff, we have not seen whether the actual spell has been changed or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is why there should be some type of test before people read PTR datamined patch notes.<br />
<br />
The damage for these abilities was greatly increased, so the bonus threat was no longer needed. They are not adjusting our threat, just how we get it (from upfront damage now)..... also, more than likely this is just a tooltip change and the bonus threat has already been removed. That happens a lot.. they make some background change, put the tooltips don´t get updated in time, and then when they do get updated, they are taken out of context by people who only read datamined ptr notes.</div></div><hr />

Shield Slam is a tooltip update. It does not provide bonus threat on live. Rune Strike is a nerf but you get extra damage. Lacerate is almost certainly a tooltip change too.<br />
<br />
And for the record, bonus threat = extra threat on top of the +200% modifier you get in Defensive Stance, Blood Presence, Righteous Fury and Bear Form. Shield Slam will (and currently does now) still give triple its damage as threat if you're in Defensive Stance. Rune Strike is currently giving x3.75 of its damage as threat on live and this will be modified down to triple its damage as threat because bonus threat on some abilities is annoying and means your damage has to be nerfed to compensate (Hence why Rune Strike is being given a damage buff)<br />
<br />
DKs are the only tanks being hit by this nerf but you should all still be fine. Warriors are not being nerfed.</div></div><hr />

rune strike is a frost spell, not frost spec only.....<br />

No, Rune Strike is considered a Frost ability, even for Blood Tanks. The &quot;Frost&quot; in the patch notes just denotes the category of spell it is, not the presence that is affected.<br />

It would seem that Blizzard has changes in mind for all tanks on how they generate threat. The question is if Blizzard wants to address tanks currently not having to stress about aggro management at all, or if they have other plans to help tanks maintain more aggro in the next tier of raiding where DPS will be even more bamf.<br />
<br />
yes, this change seems weird to me. as experience told us, tank threat are normally fine on the 1st tier of expan. And dps significantly scales better with tier progress. It only makes aggro much harder if they remove threat ability in firelands (next tier). <br />
<br />
generally, i dont like specific ability with high threat, removing those, and buffing tanks overall damage or buff blood presence/defensive stance/bear form threat maybe a better mechanism solution</div></div><hr />
