With patch 7.3 on the horizon, we thought it was time to share some updates to combat animations for several casting classes. Similar to what we did with the melee classes at the launch of Legion, these updates are all about priests, mages, Restoration and Elemental shaman, and some additional refinements to Restoration druid casting animations! Weâ€™re also continuing to work on even more enhancements for additional classes at a later point in development.<br />
<br />
A little over two years ago, we set our sights on revamping combat animations. The team has wanted to renovate it somehow, but what exactly does that mean? To determine the answer, our development leadership put together a small group of people to come up with a prototype of what we thought could use some cleaning up. You are currently experiencing the fruits of this work with the new melee animations. Our final goal was to create new melee moves that would make the game feel better, but not change how the game was played. During this prototype phase, we also came up with a plan for casters, but didnâ€™t have time to put it into production until now. Letâ€™s dig into some of the things we did.<br />
<br />
WoW has grown a lot over the last decade, and after we took stock of our combat pacing, it was clear that we needed to deliver a much tighter and more responsive experience for every button you press. Back in the days of simply chain-casting Frostbolt, it didnâ€™t really matter how much time it took your character to go from precast to missile launch. Today, you have a suite of spells at your fingertips where cast times have sped up and split-second decision making is key. To help the way the game is currently played, we wanted more timing consistency.<br />
<br />
Keeping this split-second decision making in mind for the new cast animations, we found a sweet spot between game play responsiveness and striking, weighty animation. The punchiness of our new animations were working so well, we decided to revisit our original cast animations with a fresh eye on what we had learnedâ€”while keeping the style and uniqueness of the classic cast animations for every race. The only thing we touched was the time it took to hit the cast pose since, in the live game, each raceâ€™s cast timing is different. This ensured that every spell cast with our new class animations or our iconic racial animations had the same punchy and responsive feel.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, our main goals remained the same for our next chapter in updating combat; retain the individuality and identity of what came before, pay off epic moments over the course of a battle, and update the game as seamlessly as possible. If we did our jobs right, it should feel as though it has always been this way. Our work should blend into the background so you can focus on melting, smashing, cursing, crushing, igniting, stabbing, purifying, and exploding your foes into unfathomably tiny bits. - Adam Kugler, Lead Class Designer<br />
<br />
With animation, the first things you might notice are all new caster ready idles. Currently, after you cast a spell, the character goes back to their stand animation. For this revamp, we wanted to create distinct idles that conveyed the personality of the caster much like how a melee class does while holding two swords or a giant, two-handed axe. This was tricky since class fantasy is very personal and no two people have the same idea on how a mage or shaman should stand.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
We also looked at what we could do with spells that had a cast time. Currently, directed and omni (area of effect) spells loop as the spell builds up before firing. These are distinct animations we had no intention of removing, but to fit the idea of a spell building up, we thought a strong, progressive motion showing the character pulling magic from the ground or gathering it from the air would look cool. So thatâ€™s what we did with the new precast animations. Again, class fantasy was a factor with thisâ€”how exactly does a shaman pull magic from the ground?<br />
<br />

<br />
We also created a bunch of quick, single-handed animations to add variety to instant spells. These look especially neat as you run around casting with your right and left hands. Beefier spells now have stronger straight arm moves, while curses fire with a flick of the wrist. - Kevin Rucker, Senior Animator<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/ITnk3WLAIxI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
The next step for revamped animations was revamped spell effects to go along with them! This was a tricky undertaking, especially for iconic spells. The goal was to pay homage to the originalâ€”but in some cases, we needed to completely reimagine the spell. It gave us a chance to define what each kit of magic should look like and with higher fidelity than what was possible in classic WoW. With that in mind, we aimed to work our way towards snappier, more modern spell effects without trampling too much on sacred ground. Overall, we needed the combat for casters to look and feel more exciting and rewarding while keeping a unique visual identity for each class and spec.<br />
<br />
For example, with the Blizzard spell, we kept all the same elements of the original, but brought them in line with more modern effects. We also defined what makes this frost mage-like (wispy, magical, precise) as opposed to shaman frost (naturalist, elemental, realistic) or death knight frost (bitter, aggressive, sinister). This is a good example of an homage spell, where we wanted to keep the intention of the original spell.<br />
<br />

<br />
With Arcane Missiles, on the other hand, we reimagined what it could look like. We kept the iconic structure of five bursts of four missiles, but got creative with the rest. What should a mageâ€™s Arcane magic look like? Chaotic firecracker-like sparkle explosions? We think so!<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/i2nFMCg_GDg?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
The effects revamp effort was all about the balance between paying homage to the original feel and reimagining everything. How do we breathe new life into each spec, but make sure we retain the core identity? How do we build a tighter, more cohesive class fantasy around spells players have been casting for 12+ years? How do we make sure all these fancy new effects donâ€™t tank your graphical performance? It has been a long, careful balancing act between what we, as artists, want it to look like and what you, as players, want it to feel like. Weâ€™re psyched about how it turned out and we hope youâ€™re equally psyched to run around casting your improved spells! - Sarah Carmody, FX Artist<br />

We hope you enjoyed this behind-the-scenes look at the new caster visual updates. We had lots of fun creating all these animations and effects and look forward to hearing your thoughts on them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know about everyone's desire but I know from my main Shadow Priest one of the main spells for the spec describes itself as <br />
<br />
<br />
Raise your dagger into the sky, channeling a torrent of void energy into the target for (880% of Spell power) Shadow damage over 4 sec. Insanity does not drain during this channel.<br />
<br />
but none of that channeling with the dagger happens. So in that instance I wouldn't mind seeing the weapon involved.</div></div><hr />

I think they're moving away from this though, more so all classes cast the same, and not race. Monk is probably the biggest example of this, I can't really comment on the DH.<br />

and nothing really new like implement weapons, or side effects to cloth, etc. only changed spells and gestures. either you go for &quot;lets do it all new and great&quot; or you go for &quot;keep what ppl love&quot;. but the middle of it destroys what ppl loved without adding really great stuff to the game. totally the wrong (halfassed) way in my oppinion.<br />
<br />
horrible. but maybe thats the way it goes.<br />
<br />
or its just all marketing shit, they halfassed polished the shit to have something new and call it a day and an improvement. bigger patch, bigger patch notes. yeah.<br />

<br />
factual this is the real reason behind the changes. when you play wow for a long time and look at what they done over the years, most of it wasnt for the players, but for the devs. to build up a wow that is easier to maintain and develop. A LOT of things (also a lot of that so called QoL changes) where done with obviously streamlining stuff or make stuff easier and more consistent to handle for the devs. most of the time the stick some &quot;look at the cool things we done for you&quot; at it and ppl are to blind to realize. thats my oppinion. and i read and played A LOT. but many ppl look at it from another point of view. so at the end its all oppinion and taste.<br />
<br />
Edit:<br />
for some strange reason forum quote the wrong thing. its not possible to quote the right one, this here:<br />
<br />
I've wanted new and updated caster animations for so long, but I am so so SO disappointed with this. Now every fucking caster is going to be stood around all looking exactly the same in that really goofy pose with their hands up, casting the same way. I hate that my Priest is now going to have to stand around looking stupid with her hands up. I just cannot even comprehend who at Blizzard thought this was a good idea.<br />
<br />
If I'm wrong and I'm misunderstanding this then great, I hope that is the case. Bitterly disappointed.</div></div><hr />

maybe the QQing about things they dont like ? maybe some day, after playing 8 years or so, you really loved this new anims comin with 7.3. and then, in 2025, they change it to somewhat completely different. lets assume you dont like it. are you sure you dont write this into a forum that is used for stuff like that ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
All mages have that slouch now it seems. They've all turned into orcs! Not really sure it will look great on other races. Have a feeling it will look odd on a female draenei because their back is arched so far back to begin with. Sort of like how that orc standing up-right for the shaman casting animations feels odd.<br />
<br />
Overall though, I'm happy that they didn't force weapons to be incorporated into most casting animations (keeping them to artifact weapon abilities). Something tells me with the variety of shapes and sizes that WoW has for it's weapons, you'd get odd clipping issues, or they'd have the limit the shape of weapons in the future to avoid clipping.<br />
<br />
Incorporating weapons into casting would just feel like a low-budget FFIV, tbh. Enough games do that, and WoW's casting has always just been from the caster.</div></div><hr />

I'd venture a guess and say it's because warlocks have the most new spells out of the bunch so a lot of the animations are already relatively up to date. <br />
<br />
As for things that need to be updated, goblins and worgens are hurting for an update.</div></div><hr />

I have seen comments that for some people their &quot;immersion&quot; when playing their character is strongly affected by casting animations.<br />
If blizzard did create content that suits your specific whims, it wouldn't suit someone else who would want something else.<br />
<br />
Plus a case of different staff doing different things.<br />
These need not be the same staff involved in everything else you would rather they did instead.<br />

Personally I am not too fussed about casting animations when performance on my system is comparable to a toaster.<br />

sorry i been playing for 10 years already. And this animations change are welcomes. The game animation are super old. What you feel is call nostalgia, is a common disease this days on the internet. <br />

Haven't tested it, but I doubt they would have removed them. I think it's sad that some (namely the shadow priest's artifact ability) were designed to use their weapon, but never did.<br />
<br />
<br />

Filler spells still use the racial casting animation. Depending on how often your class spams their filler, you'll get varying amounts of usage.</div></div><hr />

Final Fantasy games do a good job with any kind of spell. lol<br />
<br />
I still feel like it doesn't really fit WoW outside of special cases such as artifact weapons, or if the class fantasy was based around the weapon or style of fighting, like monks using their fists instead of their weapons. Or how frost DKs use their runeblade to throw out Howling Blast or Blood Boil; it fits the class and what their weapon means to them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless they go the FFXIV route and forever lock classes to a single weapon type I doubt that will ever happen because it'd require too much from the animators. A Black Mage in FFXIV can only ever use a staff; a Shaman in WoW can use a staff, dagger, axe, mace, fist plus there's shields, tomes, orbs ect for offhand... even if you go the &quot;lazy&quot; route and just do fist, 1h, 2h and ignore the OH entirely... thats still 3 casting animations for each spell.</div></div><hr />

Gandalf almost never does any actual magic though. I mean unless you count magic enhanced vaping as spellcasting... And in HP only some spells can be cast without wand. And dedinitely nothing that shoots stuff. Tbh, using weapons for casting makes sense. Weapons were always huge contributors to one's magical powers in wow. Kinda weird for such powerful item to be just a cosmetic thing.

Also, if we accept the premise of weapons making us this much stronger just by the virtue of sitting on our backs, imagine what we could achieve if we could channel the magic through them.<br />
<br />
The day they include weapons in our casting animations is the day I stop playing casters. Casting with hands just looks so much better to me, so if they ever change that I'm done. Unless they make it optional which, knowing Blizzard, is highly unlikely.<br />
<br />
And yeah I know some specs already have a spell that is cast through a weapon, that's why I don't play those specs, because it looks clunky and awkward (looking at you arcane).<br />
<br />
I'd much rather casters had a &quot;hide weapon&quot; option.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Does that mean that all races will now have the same casting animations, and they'll vary only from class to class and not from race to race anymore?<br />
<br />
As has been mentioned, the race specific casting animations will stay for filler spells (Frostbolt, Fireball, Lightning Bolt, Smite, etc.), it will be larger spell casts that have these special animations.<br />
<br />
Of course, mileage may vary from spec to spec on how often you'll see the racial casts.</div></div><hr />

Or removing an awful idea (Soul Effigy) that they already tried once before on Mages (Prismatic Crystal) and replacing it with something useless (Death's Embrace)?

New demon models of which you only ever get to see 1, since every spec is pidgeonholed into using 1 pet, overhauls to our class and resource that NOONE was asking for and that were only done to accomodate giving Meta to Demon Hunters. I'm fine with waiting a bit for the new animations, but Locks got 0 response to their alpha/beta feedback and we started the expansion as a broken mess, Demo is still unplayable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Originally Posted by Blizzard (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1069649-patch-73-new-combat-animations-its-magic/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/20946579?page=1#1)) <br />
With patch 7.3 on the horizon, we thought it was time to share some updates to combat animations for several casting classes. Similar to what we did with the melee classes at the launch of Legion, these updates are all about priests, mages, Restoration and Elemental shaman, and some additional refinements to Restoration druid casting animations! Weâ€™re also continuing to work on even more enhancements for additional classes at a later point in development.<br />
<br />
A little over two years ago, we set our sights on revamping combat animations. The team has wanted to renovate it somehow, but what exactly does that mean? To determine the answer, our development leadership put together a small group of people to come up with a prototype of what we thought could use some cleaning up. You are currently experiencing the fruits of this work with the new melee animations. Our final goal was to create new melee moves that would make the game feel better, but not change how the game was played. During this prototype phase, we also came up with a plan for casters, but didnâ€™t have time to put it into production until now. Letâ€™s dig into some of the things we did.<br />
<br />
WoW has grown a lot over the last decade, and after we took stock of our combat pacing, it was clear that we needed to deliver a much tighter and more responsive experience for every button you press. Back in the days of simply chain-casting Frostbolt, it didnâ€™t really matter how much time it took your character to go from precast to missile launch. Today, you have a suite of spells at your fingertips where cast times have sped up and split-second decision making is key. To help the way the game is currently played, we wanted more timing consistency.<br />
<br />
Keeping this split-second decision making in mind for the new cast animations, we found a sweet spot between game play responsiveness and striking, weighty animation. The punchiness of our new animations were working so well, we decided to revisit our original cast animations with a fresh eye on what we had learnedâ€”while keeping the style and uniqueness of the classic cast animations for every race. The only thing we touched was the time it took to hit the cast pose since, in the live game, each raceâ€™s cast timing is different. This ensured that every spell cast with our new class animations or our iconic racial animations had the same punchy and responsive feel.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, our main goals remained the same for our next chapter in updating combat; retain the individuality and identity of what came before, pay off epic moments over the course of a battle, and update the game as seamlessly as possible. If we did our jobs right, it should feel as though it has always been this way. Our work should blend into the background so you can focus on melting, smashing, cursing, crushing, igniting, stabbing, purifying, and exploding your foes into unfathomably tiny bits. - Adam Kugler, Lead Class Designer<br />
<br />
With animation, the first things you might notice are all new caster ready idles. Currently, after you cast a spell, the character goes back to their stand animation. For this revamp, we wanted to create distinct idles that conveyed the personality of the caster much like how a melee class does while holding two swords or a giant, two-handed axe. This was tricky since class fantasy is very personal and no two people have the same idea on how a mage or shaman should stand.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
We also looked at what we could do with spells that had a cast time. Currently, directed and omni (area of effect) spells loop as the spell builds up before firing. These are distinct animations we had no intention of removing, but to fit the idea of a spell building up, we thought a strong, progressive motion showing the character pulling magic from the ground or gathering it from the air would look cool. So thatâ€™s what we did with the new precast animations. Again, class fantasy was a factor with thisâ€”how exactly does a shaman pull magic from the ground?<br />
<br />

<br />
We also created a bunch of quick, single-handed animations to add variety to instant spells. These look especially neat as you run around casting with your right and left hands. Beefier spells now have stronger straight arm moves, while curses fire with a flick of the wrist. - Kevin Rucker, Senior Animator<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The next step for revamped animations was revamped spell effects to go along with them! This was a tricky undertaking, especially for iconic spells. The goal was to pay homage to the originalâ€”but in some cases, we needed to completely reimagine the spell. It gave us a chance to define what each kit of magic should look like and with higher fidelity than what was possible in classic WoW. With that in mind, we aimed to work our way towards snappier, more modern spell effects without trampling too much on sacred ground. Overall, we needed the combat for casters to look and feel more exciting and rewarding while keeping a unique visual identity for each class and spec.<br />
<br />
For example, with the Blizzard spell, we kept all the same elements of the original, but brought them in line with more modern effects. We also defined what makes this frost mage-like (wispy, magical, precise) as opposed to shaman frost (naturalist, elemental, realistic) or death knight frost (bitter, aggressive, sinister). This is a good example of an homage spell, where we wanted to keep the intention of the original spell.<br />

<br />
With Arcane Missiles, on the other hand, we reimagined what it could look like. We kept the iconic structure of five bursts of four missiles, but got creative with the rest. What should a mageâ€™s Arcane magic look like? Chaotic firecracker-like sparkle explosions? We think so!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The effects revamp effort was all about the balance between paying homage to the original feel and reimagining everything. How do we breathe new life into each spec, but make sure we retain the core identity? How do we build a tighter, more cohesive class fantasy around spells players have been casting for 12+ years? How do we make sure all these fancy new effects donâ€™t tank your graphical performance? It has been a long, careful balancing act between what we, as artists, want it to look like and what you, as players, want it to feel like. Weâ€™re psyched about how it turned out and we hope youâ€™re equally psyched to run around casting your improved spells! - Sarah Carmody, FX Artist<br />

<br />
We hope you enjoyed this behind-the-scenes look at the new caster visual updates. We had lots of fun creating all these animations and effects and look forward to hearing your thoughts on them.<br />

Casters should have race-based idle animations instead of class-based ones. Just like melee ones do.</div></div><hr />

It's the VOCAL members of the class which don't like the changes, not everyone (just playing devils advocate here, get tired of all the &quot;everyone who plays say X about the class&quot; when the only people they have heard that from are other vocal people. Not everyone expresses their opinion openly (my job role has taught me this very quickly!!!!!)<br />
<br />
In regards to the animations, I think they are long overdue. Warlocks I recall were mentioned at the beginning of all these changes of being delayed due to the animation changes they want to make taking more time. I dare say these will come out with monk and paladin updates as well, which as a caster/melee hybrid probably need more work to make the animations flow (enhancement has a simile issue as well but shaman animation seems to work well with this).</div></div><hr />

You're objectively wrong there, because whether or not they're good is completely subjective. On a vacuum, I do find them to be rather well-done and interesting, with the mage ones being my favorites, though, as I mentioned earlier, my gripe is that it means that casting animations are slowly becoming more and more class-specific than race-specific.<br />

<br />
^^This is why we want spells to use our weapons.<br />
<br />
To be clear, I don't think anyone in this group (The &quot;we want spells to use our weapons&quot; group) means that we want to actually swing our weapons and fight with them, the way a warrior does, that would be silly.<br />
<br />
What we want is for our spells to sometimes be channeled through our weapons. This has also never made more sense than it does now during Legion given the artifacts we carry. I know that; at least in my case, it feels a little silly for Aluneth to be nothing more than a glorified talisman to my mage. Considering the lore behind the weapon itself; it would make much more sense to me if my mage used Aluneth to channel and focus arcane energy and then fired the blast from the head of the staff rather than leaving it on her back. <br />
<br />
And to be honest? I'm not even so sure having some casters use the weapons themselves in the attack would even be entirely bad either in some cases. Shadowpriests and Aff Warlocks come to mind here. It's a damn shame when I see a warlock running around with the soul harvester decorating their backside, and little else. <br />
<br />
Personally I would even take it a step further and have the weapons involved in many other animations as well; again not all; as then it would just feel saturated. The shaman is probably the best candidate for alot of these: Imagine if the cast animation for chain lightning had them raise their weapon, get struck by lightning, which they then redirected at their target by pointing said weapon at them. <br />
<br />
Shadowpriests I could see having some sort of animation where they cut themselves as a sort of ritual price (thinking of something like the dragonage blood magic shtick).<br />
<br />
Hell, Paladins; does your toon ever actually open that book you carry around? <br />
<br />
It's nitpicky, sure. But I don't know I like little details like that. Or maybe I just wish my mage would swing her staff around during combat &quot;because Gandalf&quot;.<br />

<br />
<br />
Oh don't worry, warlocks will get new animation. But we will first need to give our Infernals to mages, Voidwalkers to shadow priests and soulstones to death knights, because it fits their class fantasy way better. Our new class fantasy will be new casting animations that will be made few days prior to 8.0.0. release. This will include an update skull for Agony cast, a little purple cloud on Corruption and one more imp (that's visible only 50% of the time) on Hand of Gul'dan. Our casting animation will include: <br />

Demon Hunter swooping from the skies and ripping a metamorphosis form from from us every time we cast a demonology spell<br />
And when we want to cast a destruction spell, a fire mage will appear, we will bow to him, and he will cast our spell for us (if you have Flames of Xoroth some of his spells will sometimes be green, but that will change on every patch deepening if Blizzard forgot to update them)<br />
<br />
<br />
What if they let you cast enslave demon on demon hunters, and instead of a fire mage appearing and you bowing to them; you just flat out got a new spell &quot;Summon Fire Mage: Opens a portal through the twisting nether, ripping a randomly selected fire mage with an item level similar to your own from wherever they are, including instances, to do your bidding. Cast again to gain direct control over the fire mage.&quot;</div></div><hr />

And this animations change are welcomes. The game animation are super old. What you feel is call nostalgia, is a common disease this days on the internet. <br />
<br />
I can actually see how much effor they put to generate different animations base on classes that make more sense that race animations.<br />

<br />
The issue is they removed race identity, that's why they don't fit those. I mean that's the issue besides the animations being basically overexaggerated dances moves more fitting of a pop band's back up dancers. Specially the druid ones. Go to the PTR and spam rejuv to any song from Nsync. It will fit perfectly. I've literally done this.</div></div><hr />

Nope, pretty sure they are in the same patch as the dance studio.</div></div><hr />

they don't look like they're from Runescape is a good reason to start with.</div></div><hr />

What's with this obsession over casters using their weapons to cast? You want something like that, pick up a Death Knight. We're not melee and our weapons should only ever be stat sticks.</div></div><hr />

Gandalf uses his staff when casting spells and he looks like a BAMF. Aside from literally being a stat stick, what is the aesthetic reason for the weapons to just sit around and do nothing?<br />
<br />
Slam a staff into the ground for an AoE. Read a heal from a tome, or charge it through an off-hand and unleash it. All of these would add uniqueness to the game, and give these items something to actually do.<br />
<br />
Cause you know, we can't have things that do nothing in game *Cough*Pet Battles*Cough*</div></div><hr />

You're trying to use Gandalf as an example but what you fail to realize is that he comes from a world with low magic. He spent virtually no time at all casting spells of any sort and while the scene with the Balrog was neat, it's a terrible basis for an argument as to why we should be using our weapons to cast spells. There isn't a reason nor does there need to be one. In fact, most games I have played the spellcasters never use their weapon as a conduit for their spells, it's almost always a &quot;stat stick&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Warlocks were garbage in EN, and middle of the pack at best in NH (until 7.2 when they broke aff which was after progression). <br />
<br />
----<br />
<br />
You guys member when they took most of the iconic warlock animations at handed them out to everyone else when this xpack started, reverted the only affliction animation to the vanilla version instead of the WoD one, and then put us last in line to get animation updates? I member.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So we just ignoring facts now?<br />
<br />
Nyth - top 5 (#1 caster)<br />
Ilg - Middle of the pack<br />
Renferal - top 3 (#1 caster)<br />
Ursoc - top 5<br />
Dragons - #1 (#1 caster)<br />
Cenarius - top 3<br />
Xavius - top 3<br />
<br />
As for NH top tier progression is a meaningless metric, it's all about class stacking.</div></div><hr />

They only placed ghouls in the DK one, and that makes sense.<br />
Demons in the warlock and demon hunter one.<br />
all theo thers use training dummies (from what i know)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I cannot understand how anyone likes these, they are objectively terrible. Hope we can at least have an option keep the better old ones, but doubt it. Stop fixing what ain't broken.<br />
<br />
I don't think you know what objectivity is.</div></div><hr />

Don't joke about that; Blizzard will do it. :(</div></div><hr />
