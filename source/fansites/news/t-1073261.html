Ever wondered which pets or mounts you're missing and where to get them? Time to get Collectinator (Download (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/collectinator)). This is a simple to use addon that will help you figure that out.<br />
<br />
You open the addon on the pet or mount page in your spellbook by clicking scan (top right). This will determine what pets or mounts you currently have and what you are missing. Once Collectinator is open you can also click on the top left icon to switch between pets and mounts.<br />
<br />
In the filter menu you have options such as faction, known/unknown, drop type (instance, raid, quest, crafted, mob drop, achievement, vendor &amp; pvp) as well as include or exclude special/world event, collector's editions and the WoW trading card game. You can choose to filter BoA, BoE or BoP, select by how rare the item is and what expansion it comes from. You can also search by name if looking for something specific.<br />
<br />
Expanding the item shows the location, including co-ordinates and a mouseover will select the item and shows more detailed information.<br />
<br />
Whilst you've got the item highlighted you have the following options - add/remove this item from your ignore list, link the item into your chat and with TomTom (http://www.curse.com/addons/wow/tomtom)integration - the option to add the item to the map and mini-map for tracking. <br />
<br />
Whether you're looking for a cool new pet or mount, a serious collector working towards Littlest Pet Shop (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/5875/littlest-pet-shop/) or Mountain o' Mounts (http://db.mmo-champion.com/a/2536/mountain-o-mounts/), or looking ahead to pet battles in Mists of Pandaria (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1062458-Mists-of-Pandaria-Pet-Battles-Blue-Posts-Fan-Art-Curse-Weekly-Roundup), this addon will make it easy to find those pets and mounts.<br />

New Lore: Lor'themar Theron Story Now Available!<br />
Blizzard Entertainment is proud to present the latest entry in the &quot;Leaders of Azeroth&quot; short story series: In the Shadow of the Sun! (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/leader-story/lorthemar-theron/1)<br />
<br />
Lor'themar (http://www.wowpedia.org/Lor%27themar_Theron) was not any surer of his thoughts by the day Aethas was scheduled to arrive. As he made his way through Sunfury Spire to the front hall where the archmage would appear, Halduron stopped him, holding out a small bundle of soft crimson wool. Lor'themar took it and held it up as it unfolded, beholding a regal golden phoenix upon its field: the Silvermoon City tabard.<br />
<br />
&quot;No,&quot; he said curtly, shoving the garment back at his friend.<br />
<br />
&quot;You should wear it,&quot; Halduron pressed.<br />
<br />
&quot;What does it matter?&quot; he answered, striding forward. &quot;Anyone in the service of Silvermoon may bear it.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;It is the symbol of state,&quot; Halduron called after him. &quot;You are the head of state. You should look the part.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;I am the regent lord,&quot; Lor'themar said, continuing to walk away. &quot;Not the king.&quot; <br />
<br />

Wowhead may not be able to, but the armory can. It'll list what mounts and pets you still need, also the ones you currently have.</div></div><hr />

However.... Addons can get outdated. So generally the armory is the better option. http://www.warcraftpets.com/ is the exception though, better for small pets. But no proper alternative for mounts yet that ive seen so far. Perhaps this addon will serve, for now.</div></div><hr />

After the armory update the addon is mostly useless. a 2nd monitor or even alt-tab a bit will give you the same results and in almost the same timeframe.The only pro is that Collectinator actually correctly lists all the pets. The armory has a bunch of bugs tagging some quest companions as buyable from Nalesette Wildbringer (to make it clear, that's a stable master and doesn't sell pets).</div></div><hr />

The fact that this addon has been around since 2008 might have something do with it.<br />
Predating the Armory addition by a long way.<br />
Also filtering options which put the armory to shame, and the ability to set a waypoint in tom tom or similar directly from the entry for the pet/mount for vendor sold ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
Collectinator, eh? Sounds similar to Ackis Recipe List (which is outstanding btw), but for pets and mounts. Brb... downloading<br />

Ackis is one of the authors/contributors on that addon also, hence the similarity.</div></div><hr />

I'll second the suggestion of Rarity as a companion/alternative to Collectinator. It previously existed as &quot;Bunny Hunter&quot;, so if you used that addon, it can import all the data you recordered there, as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know it wasnt written by blizzards staff.<br />
What bothres me is that all the other leaders so far got NEW stories about events after wrath, Belves got Recycled content.<br />
its a good story, but its in the wrong timeframe, and its not NEW.<br />
<br />
Rest of your post is trolling imo<br />
<br />
<br />
More recycled content, this time not even in the game!<br />
<br />
iknorite? lol<br />
its just a bit of a piss off that all the other races get really neat, in depth stories about the changeover from wrath to cata.<br />
Belves get a fanfic story (Even though its a GOOD STORY, dont get me wrong here) that they decided to slap into cannon.</div></div><hr />

What bothres me is that all the other leaders so far got NEW stories about events after wrath, Belves got Recycled content.<br />
its a good story, but its in the wrong timeframe, and its not NEW.<br />
<br />
Rest of your post is trolling imo<br />

Umm... let me correct you it is not a good story, it is terrible... It added nothing to the plot, not like there is much of since cataclysm. It's sad to see what wow has become since they replaced the original writers.</div></div><hr />

Why would i want to alt-tab and pain myself by checking the crappy site. I like that it's in game, with more features then armory.</div></div><hr />

The number of downloads says otherwise.</div></div><hr />

They change new pet additions maybe. I doubt they change the way you obtain pets ingame right now. Unless there's a blue source wich says otherwise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And this makes it easier to simply click a button in game, without having to minimize and search links in the WoW armory, especially since at times it gets laggy as hell.</div></div><hr />
