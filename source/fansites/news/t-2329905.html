Not really - most expansions have pretty much described the expansion. If the title does that - then the title is fine.<br />

So this is going to be some stupid faction war that I don't support again? Lovely. <br />
<br />
I think the worst part about this is the fact that this should have just been a patch in Legion. They started the story of the faction war and then just dropped it. They promised ToV to be the resolution of the Stormheim story which... it wasn't. I think when they announced that, everybody's thoughts immediately went to Sylvanas and Genn and not Odin being freed from the Halls of Valor. I think very few people actually cared at all about Odin being trapped in the Halls. We got nothing more with these two and it feels like they're just going to force it down our throats now. I hope they come up with something cooler than just this. Like... MoP was annoying, but they at least had the non war stuff in there first. <br />
<br />
But I guess we'll see what happens in a few hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the US when you apply for a patent you just fill in a field or two denoting who the Trademark is to be trademarked under.<br />
In NZ you actually need to register a RealMe Login and an IPONZ account before submitting that application.<br />
<br />
That means not only does it need to be logged into a registered user account before you can apply but a Real ME logon is a government login that requires manual registration before you can use it (https://www.realme.govt.nz/what-it-is/verify-your-identity/)<br />
<br />
That in itself makes me believe this one was legitimately applied for by AJ Park on Friday sometime (NZ Time). As a faker would not of been able to get a RealMe Login registered under AJ Parks name &amp; address . The trademark office would of looked at the fact that the application was coming from a different RealMe ID and IPONZ account then what AJ Park normally uses and gone &quot;Yeah right mate&quot; *DENY APPLICATION*</div></div><hr />

The real question is not if the title is good, but will the expansion be good ?<br />

They also were not rediculously vague and able to be applied to literally every expansion. Every expansion has been a Battle for Azeroth</div></div><hr />

<br />
So this is going to be some stupid faction war that I don't support again? Lovely. <br />
<br />
I think the worst part about this is the fact that this should have just been a patch in Legion. They started the story of the faction war and then just dropped it. They promised ToV to be the resolution of the Stormheim story which... it wasn't. I think when they announced that, everybody's thoughts immediately went to Sylvanas and Genn and not Odin being freed from the Halls of Valor. I think very few people actually cared at all about Odin being trapped in the Halls. We got nothing more with these two and it feels like they're just going to force it down our throats now. I hope they come up with something cooler than just this. Like... MoP was annoying, but they at least had the non war stuff in there first. <br />
<br />
But I guess we'll see what happens in a few hours.<br />
<br />
Why does it have to be a faction war? <br />
<br />
We just stopped the legion, who wanted to destroy Azeroth to stop it from being corrupted by the void. There could be some politics with sylvanas/proudmoore etc. But even Mists of Pandaria had a larger force behind the main villain. We'll probably see the old gods and their followers (Azshara) make their move now. To act sooner would have meant being caught in a three way battle with the burning legion and likely the destruction of the planet. More so than just some land conflict, this would be a battle for the world-soul of azeroth. Seems like a fitting title.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's time to reunite Horde and Alliance, and exterminate undead (both npc and playable race).<br />
<br />
The biggest single bad guy ever is Sargeras, and even if the Old Gods' physical strength is a mere fraction of his might, the threat they are posing is not to be neglected..</div></div><hr />

Lich King was a battle for Northrend<br />
BC was a battle for Draenor<br />
Legion was a battle for Broken Isles and Argus<br />
WoD (see BC)<br />
<br />
etc<br />
<br />
Point is - Battle for Azeroth 'promises' something far grander.<br />
<br />
Whole lot of derp coming off of that gnome head of yours.<br />
LK was not a battle just for Northrend. Just b/c something took place there, doesn't mean it's restricted to only that area. Do you honestly believe LK would have just never left his snow globe? He was going to unleash the scourge on all of azeroth, just like he started doing in the pre event. As for legion, see previous statement. Same thing. They weren't just going to take over and sit on some islands. Next time actually think before you type</div></div><hr />

That's a good point! Faction vs faction expansion would not make much sense, as there would not be a winner due to all the crybabies. <br />
<br />
Or maybe it starts as a faction vs faction with no conclusion, as suddenly a new big baddy comes that wants to eat Azeroth itself. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Why do people assume &quot;Battle for Azeroth&quot; means that Azeroths denizens fight each other? Battle of Britain was not fought by the British amongst each other either. They defended their home against an outsider.<br />
<br />
While I'd say the title might be misleading if you have nothing left, and that it could be a faction war expansion, I doubt it. It will most likely be an outside main villain with some faction positioning and strategic snatching of resources.</div></div><hr />

I sincerely doubt that &quot;Battle for Azeroth&quot; = a battle between factions, not with all the foreshadowing of Void and shit. It's probably more in the literal sense, that we'll &quot;battle for the survival of our world&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And the pre-expansion book for Warlords had a long and complicated trial for Garrosh that was supposed to deliver him to justice, how did that turn out? To judge the contents of a book by one chapter and how it will develop is pretty naive. Otherwise the Lord of the Rings is a 3 volume book describing how Hobbits celebrate their birthday. <br />
<br />
It makes sense for Sylvanas to make a move on Stormwind. She got her... ascension, or whatever she planned in Stormheim, denied, now she looks for other ways to drastically increase the UD population. They are still dying out lorewise, aren't they? Not many other kingdoms to attack.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it isn't a faction war expansion, or starts out as one, but it would be rather weird. So far, the last expansions all lead into each other more or less seamless.<br />
<br />
The denizens of Azeroth just witnessed their Planet getting stabbed by a giant fiery demon in the sky. Literally. To go on with &quot;Meanwhile, Orks vs Humans again!&quot; makes little sense, at least to me. <br />
<br />
Let's just patiently wait out the next few hours.</div></div><hr />

Battle For Azeroth signifies the Horde + Alliance + Void (in the form of Old Gods) battling to gain control of Azeroth, now that it is clear she is a titan capable of being influenced still. Each faction has a leader lusting after the power of the Titan in order to &quot;protect their people&quot;, &quot;crush their enemies&quot; and so on. This is why the horde and alliance will be the main focus of the expansion, with breaks to deal with Old Gods.</div></div><hr />

That's exactly why a faction war is pointless. Because those same people will be rioting and mass unsubbing if their faction &quot;loses&quot; and Blizz won't risk that. When you have half the player base on each faction, you can't piss off either one of them, thus everything has to be &quot;equal&quot; and a stalemate. Which makes for an incredibly boring, pointless and predictable story. Thus the &quot;faction war&quot; has gone NOWHERE in 10+ years, and will continue to go nowhere in a MMO as Blizz won't risk pissing off half their player base by wrecking one factions cities/making them &quot;losers&quot;. We already know neither faction will win, so it's a pointless waste of time till Warcraft 4 (which will probably never happen).</div></div><hr />

If this is real, it will be Cata/Mists/Draenor all over again. Couldn't sound anymore boring. Especially if this results in another Garry tier. As much as alliance fanboys want to kill Sylvanas she's more interesting left alive. It's always been one of the few things I've liked. That someone who has fallen pretty hard and is basically full blown evil now is still alive and kicking and annoying Alliance. It be pretty hypocritical to make her the main bad and give Jaina the moral high ground when she's basically Sylvanas 2.0. Who knows, maybe there will be a twist and Sylvanas will be redeemed and Jaina turned into the big bad and our first raid of an Alliance character. I mean it's only fair. Siege of Stormwind when?</div></div><hr />

<br />
so what if it shuts down? it's a game, not a life style. people don't revolve their lives around a game. well, others, not those like you, who actually thinks he can get to someone over a game shutting down. back to your corner</div></div><hr />
