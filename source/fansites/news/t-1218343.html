As promised, we wanted to give you all an update on what we’ve been working on with regards to the cross-realm zone feature. Just to recap, cross-realm zones are meant to improve the leveling experience by increasing the amount of people in the same zone together, while also allowing you to quest with your Real ID or BattleTag friends. It’s a complex feature, and there are still some technical issues that we’re continuing to work to address. We’re committed to further refining the system so that it provides the best possible gameplay experience.<br />
<br />
This is an update on the technical issues we’ve been working on and some of the progress we’ve made. <br />
<br />
Time Zone Jumps<br />
<br />
Right now we have a three-hour time zone differential limit on which realms can be mixed together. This is intended to reduce day/night jumps from occurring when crossing CRZ zones, as well as time zone jumps that may cause world events to end earlier than intended. We agree that the day/night jump can be jarring, and planning for last minute turn-ins for events can be difficult and frustrating.<br />
<br />
We’re still discussing how to best approach this situation. One of the ideas being floated around is potentially changing how regional time zones work on a very fundamental level. It’s a change we’ve been discussing for quite a while, and perhaps the CRZ system provides the catalyst to go ahead and make it. We’ll keep you updated as we consider the best solution.<br />
<br />
CRZ Transition Lag and Performance<br />
<br />
There are still some tech-related quirks that are being hashed out, including framerate hitching when crossing into a CRZ zone, reports of performance issues, and resource nodes/NPCs/players disappearing. We’re still investigating each specific cause and working to smooth these types of issues out.<br />
<br />
We also continue to see some reports that people are being dismounted when crossing borders. Single-player mounts should not being doing this, so please post any details in the Bug Report forum if it continues happening. There are technical limitations preventing multi-passenger mounts from holding separate characters when crossing a zone boundary. Unfortunately, this isn’t something that we can quickly or easily fix.<br />
<br />
Despite a few lingering technical issues, we’re happy with how CRZ is populating the leveling areas with other players, and helping to once again foster MMO social experiences in the 1-85 content. The process for tuning CRZ is of course one that’s ongoing, and we’re committed to continuing to work on it and iron out any remaining issues as quickly as possible. If you do have bugs to report, please provide details and the reproduction steps (if possible) on the Bug Report forum (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/1012660/). Providing detailed information helps tremendously, and when possible, add your report to a relevant thread before creating your own.<br />
<br />
Thank you again for your feedback. We’re continuing to monitor reports and we’ll provide updates as they become available.<br />

I'm not quite sure Blizzard understands what &quot;improve&quot; means. Giving us a wider variety of mounts used by players from other servers to cover up mailboxes is not an &quot;improvement&quot;. Dalaran lags almost as bad as Stormrage now that there's a few dozen servers worth of players stacked up in there now.</div></div><hr />

By and large, people group with those they already know, so all CRZ does for those not grouped is provide unwanted (on PvE anyways) competition. I'm just glad my Monk is now in Pandaria so the performance glitches will stop annoying me for now unless I go pet hunting.</div></div><hr />

Also killing world bosses cross realm should make you eligible for loot because trying to find Galleon on my server is annoying (Obviously it should still only be lootable once a week</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also this is WORLD of Warcraft. A MMO which once prided itself on the persistent and immersive world it created for players to experience. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but I am not the only one who finds the whole &quot;framerate hitching when crossing into a CRZ zone&quot;, &quot; technical limitations preventing multi-passenger mounts from holding separate characters when crossing a zone boundary&quot; and &quot;resource nodes/NPCs/players disappearing&quot; more than just a little JARRING. This undermines the entire experience you aim to create and to think of it as just a few &quot;tech-related quirks&quot; is a gross understatement.</div></div><hr />

In this game every other player out there is your enemy while questing and will always be as long as &quot;tagging&quot; will work. It is a horrible, horrible thing, tagging.<br />

Just my two cents but I do believe a lot of players agree.</div></div><hr />

I'm all for CRZ, it's a brilliant move by Blizzard and nice to see they will keep it going on the development front, whatever that entails.. Let's see it in Pandaria.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. I got used to that mining in Uldum. My main issue is The Rare Spawns which should be realm specific - and all the glitches. I fly my friend around a lot while we are playing, EVERY single zone we cross into, she'll get dismounted, and it'll take a minute or two for the zone to completely load, for her to mount again, only to repeat the process every zone.</div></div><hr />

My friends and I all have toons we like on different servers and this allows us to play together without having two or three people re-roll toons just to work together. I also like how there are people now in the world.</div></div><hr />

It's not just you. CRZ blue posts never address the actual social and community concerns, just the stuff we already know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which would be a poll made a million times already. People like CRZ because they like to play and interact with other players, and not feel like a single player game when leveling. Technical issues aside, it's one of the best things to happen to this game in a long time.<br />
<br />
However, there has been absolutely no valid feedback against CRZ. Again, technical issues not included, since they are getting fixed as we write. &quot;'m getting ganked more&quot;, &quot;People are stealing my nodes&quot;...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would understand if they made CRZs with level brackets (like battlegrounds) but a single lvl 90 hunter standing on the Dark Portal, waiting to oneshot any low level player going around doesn't seem like something any game would want to be about.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">tusker</div><div class="date">2012-10-30, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">CRZ is fine and all, but if you're on a low pop server, it just makes [some] things worse.<br />
<br />
The economy on a low pop sucks, but if you want to farm anything old-world it's much more difficult with CRZ. At least on other higher pop servers you have an economy and AH that actually is stocked with items. In the past, since the low pop server had a crappy AH, you could actually get mats and other things on your own. Now, low pop basically has the worst of both worlds...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correction: the wants of the people who only whine about it. <br />
<br />
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias<br />
<br />
The people who are whining about CRZ are NOT the majority of players. Most people who like the feature makes no comment on it whatsoever, as they're busy enjoying the game as it should instead of whining and wasting their own time about a feature that's only going to improve the more iteration is done on it.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the moment most of the bugs and timezone issues are ironed out, I doubt people would even notice CRZ.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ramaniscence</div><div class="date">2012-10-30, 07:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone complaining about CRZ is, unfortunately, missing the point.<br />
<br />
For the most part, CRZ are doing exactly what they were intended to do, and well: Create a more unified WarCraft community. They've increased and balanced World PvP on a faction v. faction level, and they've brought life to zones and servers that once felt dead. This is a GOOD thing.<br />
<br />
The majority of problems you are experiencing are inherit problems with the game itself: Griefing, ganking, general player v. player harassment. WarCraft does nothing to discourage players from attacking characters that are a drastically lower level than they are. Some people like that (people who're a high level) other's don't (people trying to level lowbies), whether or not it's right or wrong has no simple answer, but it's clear the amount of ganking and low-level griefing has obviously risen drastically along with zone population. Maybe every town needs level 90+ guards, maybe there needs to be a kind of dishonorable kill system re-introduced, I don't know, but that problem does NOT lie with CRZ.<br />
<br />
The same thing goes for questing, quest items, quest mobs, mining nodes etc. There is nothing to discourage griefing by stealing mobs, etc. It's easy to say &quot;deal with it&quot;, but that's not necessarily the best response. (also winning the Stranglethorn fishing competition was never supposed to be easy, esp. on a PvP server.)<br />
<br />
Cross-realm zones are essentially working as intended and you are experiencing World of Warcraft in the way that it was originally intended; a way that you may not have experienced in a very long time, if ever. You are now realizing that World of WarCraft itself, NOT CRZ, is broken. Hopefully Blizzard will address this on a GAMEPLAY level rather than just removing CRZ, because I believe that would be a huge step backwards.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also to be fair, CRZ is a huge experiment and the level of data needed to determine how it would turn out is essentially unattainable without live testing. In order to bring everything back into order, as I said, they're going to have to make HUGE gameplay change, and I think that's a good thing. What we're experiencing now is a huge inconvenience, but a necessary evil. I view it as an incomplete improvement that is a sign of better things to come.</div></div><hr />

If they want CRZ to foster social experiences, let us trade cross realm and let us use friend lists cross realm without the added complication of battle tags. Possibly finally let us send heirlooms across server when fixing this.</div></div><hr />

Right. But game should give you tasks of different difficulty. PVE is piece of cake. Going raids, dps'ng, rolling epics - it's kinda boring. 90 lvl foe is an extremely difficult task. More differences in game - more fun.</div></div><hr />

If your friend is too low level they cant always fly themselves. Also its nice when you are doing it with your boyfriend, he can go make a drink while I fly us to where we want to go. Sometimes its nice to fly together.<br />

No, you're missing the point. The point isn't about stealing. It's about opportunity. Outside of PvP servers (which I purposefully don't play, because I don't like being griefed) people are angry because where you were previously by yourself, leveling at your own pace, suddenly you have 10s of people crammed into the same place. It's an artificial gating device as insipid and anger-inducing as the Golden Lotus gate, or using both Valor and Rep grinds to buy a single item.<br />
<br />
It's also a quality of life issue. I have absolutely no issue if you and your four friends from five different servers want to party up and quest together. That's great - huzzah, mutual happiness. I do have an issue with Blizzard just blatantly telling me, with no chance of opting out, that I am going to have to share my low population server with 100's of other players, but not have their high population resources available to me. That affects my quality of life. To the point, that if Pandaria had started CRZ, I wouldn't have bought it. As it is, I'm leveling my monk primarily through dungeons. It isn't fun.<br />
<br />
Competition isn't the bees knees to some of us. Competition breeds hatred, hatred leads to canceled accounts. I chose a low pop server so I could interact with people on my terms - and yes, if I wanted to quest or archy or farm in solitude, I could. Now, I can't.<br />

With all due respect, if you wanted to play a game by yourself with limited interaction with other people, perhaps World of WarCraft was not the best choice for you. <br />

<br />
Guild Wars? Neverwinter Nights? Second Life, even really. There are, and have been, plenty of games that give the kind of gameplay you're looking for. WoW was not intended to be one ever, unfortunately</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mackeyser</div><div class="date">2012-10-30, 07:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone complaining about CRZ is, unfortunately, missing the point.<br />
<br />
For the most part, CRZ are doing exactly what they were intended to do, and well: Create a more unified WarCraft community. They've increased and balanced World PvP on a faction v. faction level, and they've brought life to zones and servers that once felt dead. This is a GOOD thing.<br />
<br />
The majority of problems you are experiencing are inherit problems with the game itself: Griefing, ganking, general player v. player harassment. WarCraft does nothing to discourage players from attacking characters that are a drastically lower level than they are. Some people like that (people who're a high level) other's don't (people trying to level lowbies), whether or not it's right or wrong has no simple answer, but it's clear the amount of ganking and low-level griefing has obviously risen drastically along with zone population. Maybe every town needs level 90+ guards, maybe there needs to be a kind of dishonorable kill system re-introduced, I don't know, but that problem does NOT lie with CRZ.<br />
<br />
The same thing goes for questing, quest items, quest mobs, mining nodes etc. There is nothing to discourage griefing by stealing mobs, etc. It's easy to say &quot;deal with it&quot;, but that's not necessarily the best response. (also winning the Stranglethorn fishing competition was never supposed to be easy, esp. on a PvP server.)<br />
<br />
Cross-realm zones are essentially working as intended and you are experiencing World of Warcraft in the way that it was originally intended; a way that you may not have experienced in a very long time, if ever. You are now realizing that World of WarCraft itself, NOT CRZ, is broken. Hopefully Blizzard will address this on a GAMEPLAY level rather than just removing CRZ, because I believe that would be a huge step backwards.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also to be fair, CRZ is a huge experiment and the level of data needed to determine how it would turn out is essentially unattainable without live testing. In order to bring everything back into order, as I said, they're going to have to make HUGE gameplay change, and I think that's a good thing. What we're experiencing now is a huge inconvenience, but a necessary evil. I view it as an incomplete improvement that is a sign of better things to come.<br />
<br />
Your response makes much more sense with respect to PvP servers. I actually think that CRZ may be a GOOD thing for them.<br />
<br />
The problem is that CRZ is actually creating tremendous incentives on PvE servers for anti-social behavior. I'm on Gnomer, a 3rd rate PvE server, and frankly, the ONLY time I've ever seen self interest this bad was the first two days of TBC launch in Hellfire Penninsula. And again, during that time, there were tremendous incentives to behaving badly towards one's own faction. <br />
<br />
I'm actually more likely to help a hordie (I'm alliance) than an alliance on my server because most horde on our server still respect the &quot;don't steal nodes/herbs/mobs. I've been shown more respect and courtesy from the opposing faction in the last two expacs than by MY faction and it's not even close. <br />
<br />
And that experience is not unique on PvE servers. Intra-faction rivalries and a complete lack of respect for other players (because there still seems to be some semblance of opposing faction respect) means that my antipathy is generally reserved for OTHER Alliance. <br />
<br />
And that is where CRZ comes in. CRZ creates fertile ground and incentivizes the worst behaviors and without that cross faction rivalry, PvE servers become Douchevilles. I mean, you can't ask for help with an elite or rare. That ally is more likely to try and pull mobs to you so you'll die and then tag the mob for himself. <br />
<br />
I think CRZ is something that should be built for PvP servers. For PvE servers, it's been horrible. And much like Blizzard stinks on ice at balancing classes with both PvE and PvP in mind, I firmly believe that they will and have stunk on ice balancing CRZ with PvE and PvP realms in mind. PvP realms are seeing a renaissance (for those that enjoy world PvP) whereas PvE realms are becoming less fun by the day. <br />
<br />
In the end I think PvP realms will be a winner in all this, but since I don't think Blizz can create content more compelling than its player's capacity to behave badly toward each other, I think CRZs will crush PvE realms and in the end will be seen as an example of what not to do. <br />
<br />
CRZs already make the world feel less contiguous than it did in Vanilla. I mean, that lag might as well be a short load screen...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except this &quot;massively multiplayer&quot; thing they are insisting on with CRZ is artificial, these cross realm players might as well be NPCs that gank and take nodes/quest mobs. Sure you can have a little conversation in /1 or whatever, but these cross realm people are nobodies and they're gone forever after you leave the zone, there is no repercussion if they are the rudest person you have ever met in your life, because going into trade chat and warning your server about them is laughable.</div></div><hr />

Well again, this is more something that is a gameplay issue. WoW has a bad history of really not having a good solution for over-populated zones. The way the system works right now was just not built to sustain every zone being full of active people. That's on a questing, gathering, rare-mob hunting level game-wide. You should not have to group up/interact with other people in order to progress in the game as a whole, however interaction with other people is an inherit gameplay mechanic of an MMO and should be expected. ie you should expect to have to compete for nodes, quest items, and rare mobs to some extent, but not to the extent we are experiencing now. As I said the system really doesn't do anything to encourage WORKING TOGETHER as it does for being a complete asshat.<br />
<br />
There's lots of things they could do to &quot;fix&quot; things, but most of them have their own trade off:<br />
-Put smaller, stricter caps on players per zone. But what happens if everyone from every zone invites other people over? What happens if it's unbalanced as far as high-level people getting in?<br />
-Prioritize low-level people. This would help, but then could low-level people invite higher level people to either help them powerlevel OR to gank other people in the area?<br />
-Remove cross-realm zones/merge low-pop server. This would either go back to the barren zones we have now, or angry people on low-pop servers that wanted to keep things low pop.<br />
<br />
I'm sure we'll see any number of these things implemented in some degree, but I would rather them fix the problem with a system that encourages this type of gameplay in favor of one that encourages teamwork and community. A lot of people have mentioned GW2, and I think that's a pretty good example of this kind of thing done right, but isn't something that fits tooo perfectly into WoW's model.<br />

People played WoW because they wanted to exclusively 40 man raid. People played WoW because they wanted to farm achievements on a level 1 character. People felt that they should be the ONLY ONES to experience high level raid content because they EARNED IT and no one else should. Just because they were all possible under the gameplay mechanics present, does not mean they were playing the game as it was intended. All of these people, like you, paid to play WoW.<br />

I agree with this wholeheartedly.<br />
Whilever you have to compete with your fellow faction members for spawns and mobs and nodes and everything, seeing more people around is only going to be seen as annoying, not beneficial.

Yea, people like it because now they can play with their friends...but other than that all it does is create a congested leveling experience where people have to sit in line trying to get quest mobs killed i.e. zangarmarsh. Not to mention it puts a damper on the economy because not only are people hard pressed to gather resources now, but the resources are being spread out onto multiple auction houses. i.e. fel iron ore now is not only being split horde/alliance, but multiplied with the amount of servers meaning less resources and more frustration for everyone.<br />
<br />
but yea..best feature ever implemented by blizzard hands down....lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
your argument is flawed.. &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
Nobody has numbers on who wants CRZ to stay and who wish it to get lost. And blizzard is not going to do a poll for it. So everything you say with &quot;majority&quot; is simply a thing you pulled out of your *peep*. There is no proof who like it and who hate it, so far only the people who suffer because of ganking/griefing are complaining looking at threads. <br />
<br />
If you are on a PVP server its your own mistake. You knew this was what a PVP server meant and you got what you deserved.<br />
<br />
For the rest yes they have to fix a few things:<br />
<br />
&gt; Nodes need to be server bound<br />
&gt; rare pets/ npcs / mobs have to be server bound.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aqua</div><div class="date">2012-10-30, 08:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No, you're missing the point. The point isn't about stealing. It's about opportunity. Outside of PvP servers (which I purposefully don't play, because I don't like being griefed) people are angry because where you were previously by yourself, leveling at your own pace, suddenly you have 10s of people crammed into the same place. It's an artificial gating device as insipid and anger-inducing as the Golden Lotus gate, or using both Valor and Rep grinds to buy a single item.<br />
<br />
It's also a quality of life issue. I have absolutely no issue if you and your four friends from five different servers want to party up and quest together. That's great - huzzah, mutual happiness. I do have an issue with Blizzard just blatantly telling me, with no chance of opting out, that I am going to have to share my low population server with 100's of other players, but not have their high population resources available to me. That affects my quality of life. To the point, that if Pandaria had started CRZ, I wouldn't have bought it. As it is, I'm leveling my monk primarily through dungeons. It isn't fun.<br />
<br />
Competition isn't the bees knees to some of us. Competition breeds hatred, hatred leads to canceled accounts. I chose a low pop server so I could interact with people on my terms - and yes, if I wanted to quest or archy or farm in solitude, I could. Now, I can't.<br />
<br />
It obviously doesn't matter to you whose gameplay this interrupts, but please, for the love of Elune, don't put words in the mouths of us who are forced to endure this abomination with no recourse. Complaining to Blizzard falls on deaf ears - there are plenty of people who feel that shouting at the side community is their only chance to vent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hello. This is an MMO. We're glad to have you aboard but for the love of god please know what you're supposed to be getting into. <br />
<br />
Look my realm was quiet, sleepy and unpopulated. I'm on a very quiet Medium (on the best days) realm. And yeah I could farm anything without interruption, quest for DAYS without seeing another soul, and /emote to myself to no one around with no one to point and laugh at my stupidity.<br />
<br />
Y'know what it feels like? A VERY boring single player game. And if I wanted to play that there's nigh on thousands of great alternatives to playing World of Warcraft. If you garner hatred over people being dickish in games then I'm afraid you need anger management issues and might need to just deal with your fellow man because back when the game was fresh and interesting to everyone, we all had to deal with everyone, and you know what? Friendships were forged. Guilds who are still going 8 years strong have seen their origins because YES they were forced to deal with each others shit first.<br />
<br />
So good. I'm glad they're falling on deaf ears because this feature may end up prolonging the game life for less antisocial people. Features I could think to improve the mechanics are 'realm invites' You only get maybe 1 a month, but if you really like playing with someone you can invite their character to your realm and start forming a guild with others.<br />
<br />
I hate to tell you but most of WoW sees the entire game as one big contest. And competition is their life blood. And... yeah if you look at it, it is. Weather you're competing on lower brackets or the highest pinnacles, it's ALL competition. Part of why WoW thrived the way it did was the hardships of pushing through it with other people and I'm sorry it's been thrust back on us with such suddenness that some of you are in shock and indignant but...that's just the way the world works unless you're a sociopath with 8 locks on his doors and running through 9 credit-cards to fuel your internet connection.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I'll let you in on a little secret. I don't even talk in my GUILD unless someone talks to me specifically. I'm THAT shy. So if I can face up to just having to quest and play and farm with others, you can damn well toughen your shell up matey and go out and make some new friends or enemies.<br />
<br />
<br />
The issues with resource availability are just not an issue, the nodes re-spawn at a rate of being farmed, as they always have. Just... join in and you'll yield about the same amount you always have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why add functions to a game that cannot function with things that were supposedly a benefit... aka two person mounts.<br />
<br />
I agree, the dismounting of passengers when crossing borders is incredibly frustrating. When someone asks me for a ride somewhere my initial thought now is &quot;Hell no!&quot;, because it takes forever when you add in finding them again, picking them up, waiting for them to rez if they get killed because of it, etc. Before MOP my same reaction to this request would've been &quot;Of course!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fix it Blizzard. If there were issues with this function of CRZ it should've never gone live until fixed. Breaking two seater mounts is unforgivable.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ganush</div><div class="date">2012-10-30, 08:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Everyone complaining about CRZ is, unfortunately, missing the point.<br />
<br />
For the most part, CRZ are doing exactly what they were intended to do, and well: Create a more unified WarCraft community. They've increased and balanced World PvP on a faction v. faction level, and they've brought life to zones and servers that once felt dead. This is a GOOD thing.<br />
<br />
The majority of problems you are experiencing are inherit problems with the game itself: Griefing, ganking, general player v. player harassment. WarCraft does nothing to discourage players from attacking characters that are a drastically lower level than they are. Some people like that (people who're a high level) other's don't (people trying to level lowbies), whether or not it's right or wrong has no simple answer, but it's clear the amount of ganking and low-level griefing has obviously risen drastically along with zone population. Maybe every town needs level 90+ guards, maybe there needs to be a kind of dishonorable kill system re-introduced, I don't know, but that problem does NOT lie with CRZ.<br />
<br />
The same thing goes for questing, quest items, quest mobs, mining nodes etc. There is nothing to discourage griefing by stealing mobs, etc. It's easy to say &quot;deal with it&quot;, but that's not necessarily the best response. (also winning the Stranglethorn fishing competition was never supposed to be easy, esp. on a PvP server.)<br />
<br />
Cross-realm zones are essentially working as intended and you are experiencing World of Warcraft in the way that it was originally intended; a way that you may not have experienced in a very long time, if ever. You are now realizing that World of WarCraft itself, NOT CRZ, is broken. Hopefully Blizzard will address this on a GAMEPLAY level rather than just removing CRZ, because I believe that would be a huge step backwards.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also to be fair, CRZ is a huge experiment and the level of data needed to determine how it would turn out is essentially unattainable without live testing. In order to bring everything back into order, as I said, they're going to have to make HUGE gameplay change, and I think that's a good thing. What we're experiencing now is a huge inconvenience, but a necessary evil. I view it as an incomplete improvement that is a sign of better things to come.<br />
<br />
Tho I agree with your post, the problem is that CRZ has taken away the ability of the individual to choose a realm that is relatively free of these issues. Like it or not, some realms were much better behaved than others and the player had some choice in where and who they played with. CRZ has basically eliminated the choice of players as to which realm and thus which social environment they choose to play on, because Blizzard has taken away that choice. You could play on Realm Lovefest and get randomly paired with realm Griefstorm and their is nothing you can do about it.<br />
<br />
All that said, I have had no issues with CRZ personally I do understand a lot of the concerns. I believe Blizzard does have to be willing to clamp down on all forms of griefing and harrassment with stiffer repercussions as well as better define what entails griefing if CRZ is really going to work out well.</div></div><hr />

I have been questing in Hyjal and instead of seeing 1 or 2 people around, I was seeing quite a bunch, it made the game feel more alive, but yes, questing could be crowded at times, and gathering especially in Outland and Northrend is a pain in the ***, I had to level jewelcrafting and engineering recently and that was painful.<br />
<br />
One 90 monk tried to gank me unsuccessfully, but I knew the risks when I leveled on a pvp server. I've been ganked prior to CRZ, it just is more present on servers where there was a faction imbalance before.<br />
<br />
But it's how the game should have been from the start, and how it should be played.. you have that amount of people right now, and I don't see people complaining about the zones being too crowded.</div></div><hr />

I haven't stepped foot in a raid since mop launched. Dunno if I will. I despise dungeon and lfr groups but at least with them I never have to see them again. For an organized raid team I have to put up with the Whiney selfish gear hog every week complaining every kill that he didn't get his loots. <br />
<br />
Crz is same. Just last night I had some 39 rogue pestering me to go kill the Orc warlock that he had failed to gank multiple times. Upon informing him to fight his own battles bc I didn't feel like flagging myself to one shot a lowbie he proceeded to run around killing battle pets as I approached them. <br />
<br />
Childish behavior such as that is what ruins this game. It's turned me very anti social and lately I find myself doing stupid stuff like pet battles and mount farming instead of heroic raiding like I used to.</div></div><hr />

You have a very skewed view on the lore of this game lol. Lord Garithos and the rest of the warcraft 3 alliance challenge your definition of &quot;Noble&quot;. Honestly &quot;Racist&quot; fits much better. Now I can't deny that GARROSH'S horde is dreadful.... good thing I'm a loyal member of THRALL'S horde and am simply waiting the return of my real leader. Horde is way more honorable than all but 2 of the races the alliance have......

<br />
Genocide is unforgivable. Mass oppression of the poor and downtrodden, that's unforgivable. Breaking a perk in a video game is mildly inconvenient. Temper your rhetoric. ;)<br />
<br />
I've read through this thread and I'm not sure how I feel about CRZ now. I'm not leveling an alt in a CRZ environment, so I haven't really had that experience; but I have been spending a lot of time in low-level zones with my 90, going after Pet Battles achievements. (I don't have any opinion on the PVP side of things, because I'm on a PVE server; I'm terrible at PVP and don't enjoy it.)<br />
<br />
All that said, the arguments I see here in favor of CRZ all seem to be saying that &quot;it's what Blizzard intended&quot; (that is, more highly populated areas rather than barren player-free wastelands). So far the only specific benefit touted is that you can play with your friends from other zones (CRG, or cross-realm grouping), but I don't think that should be lumped in with automatic zone merging (AZM), since those two features could certainly be separate.<br />
<br />
So far, I can't really see any benefit to AZM, since Blizzard's stated motivation (to increase the outdoor population) so far doesn't seem to be benefitting anyone. Or at least, virtually no one is saying that they're enjoying seeing more people in previously low-pop zones. I haven't noticed higher populations in any of the zones I've been doing Pet Battles in; in fact, honestly, I can't remember seeing a single person out in the world the entire time, except maybe once in Westfall. Oh, and once in Blade's Edge, where someone jacked the critter I was about to fight ;)<br />
<br />
Maybe it is what Blizzard intended, but I don't know that AZM is having the effect Blizzard said it would. The game doesn't seem to be more enjoyable by having more people randomly wandering around, because either there aren't many more people (like I said, I'm seeing virtually no one out in the world in pre-MOP zones), or there's so many people that it's suddenly changed the feel of the game. Yeah, maybe nobody had any right to expect that the low-pop no-competition gameplay we all got used to would remain the same as it always was, but the effect has been to upset a lot of the players who enjoyed it.<br />
<br />
For my part, CRZ has had basically no impact on me, except for two things, which are no more than minor inconveniences:<br />
<br />
1) The framerate hitch when I switch realms (which lasts less than a second each time it occurs—before I even have a chance to realize something's wrong, it ends).<br />
<br />
2) The time zone changes confuse me when I look at the clock and see that it's suddenly much later than it used to be. Takes me a second to realize that it's just a different time zone.<br />
<br />
Both issues have been recognized by Blizzard. I've seen no personal benefit from AZM, but aside from the above minor inconveniences, no personal detriment either. (CRG has been loads of fun, though.)</div></div><hr />

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias<br />
<br />
The people who are whining about CRZ are NOT the majority of players. Most people who like the feature makes no comment on it whatsoever, as they're busy enjoying the game as it should instead of whining and wasting their own time about a feature that's only going to improve the more iteration is done on it.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the moment most of the bugs and timezone issues are ironed out, I doubt people would even notice CRZ.<br />
<br />
The same can be said about the people who don't like it. But they keep trucking along anyways and don't say anything. You have no proof who isn't and who is in the majority for the discussion of this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
CRZ is two separate things: automatic zone merging (AZM) and cross-realm grouping (CRG). There's no fundamental reason why they both have to be allowed. Everyone loves CRG; a lot of people hate AZM and almost nobody, so far, has demonstrated any particular benefits to AZM. Blizzard's claim that the intent is to increase outdoor population is plausible, but the practical effect seems to have mostly been to make a lot of people angry and not benefit anyone in particular.<br />
<br />
Right now I'd be in favor of retaining CRG and getting rid of AZM.</div></div><hr />

Yes, yes it did. I just went and found several mobs in 1-60 and Cataclysm (80-85) level zones that have the &quot;!&quot; multi-tag thing. I found an article from January 2011 talking about multi-tagging, but the forums won't let me post it as a hyperlink yet:<br />

I'm not sure I see the issue with that, it sounds akin to running around unflagged with someone flagged for PvP. Unless you mean that the ganker could not attack a healer they could not see?<br />

Either way, I could see it being handled the same way - you engage with someone with CRZ on, it's forced on for you, similar to a PvP flag. You go solo and keep to yourself, it stays off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The handling of CRZs has been the one thing that's really shaken my confidence in Blizzard as developers recently. It's horribly bad game design for a product like WoW in it's current incarnation.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">SumoSizeIt</div><div class="date">2012-10-30, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">How about no? That goes against the point of CRZ. If you don't like to be ganked go to a pve realm. If you don't like to play with other people, then go play some single player game, mabye try diablo 3.The problem is that you're projecting your interpretation of what it means to be an MMO or PvP realm on someone who may have a different interpretation, and no single person is correct.<br />
<br />
There are other ways to play with folks other than questing alongside of them, and before CRZ players were able to chose a realm based on the activity level of the PvP or PvE communities. One can hate getting ganked by 90s and still enjoy the challenge of being ambushed by someone their own level now and then, or they can be the type that thrives on a good corpse run while a group of max level players teabag their body, or somewhere in between.<br />
<br />
PvP interests are not so black and white, it's more than just picking a PvP or PvE realm. Before CRZ, people had the choice of realms with varying degrees of casual/hardcore, ruthless/honorable communities, and everyone could find a community that fit them. Now we're all tossed in together, and suddenly people like you are insisting that others are playing the game wrong after having enjoyed their unique community for nearly a decade. You're no more correct in your interpretation of PvP and MMO than the rest of us - it's all a matter of opinion, and CRZ should account for the interests of more than one segment of players.<br />

Well, I can understand why they wouldn't do that, same reason they don't want questing in raids.

<br />
They do, actually. Since when farming (ore, herbs, battle pets) you merge onto another server, the competition for those node increases, making farming more time consuming and less fun since there is basically triple to quadruple the number of people farming the same stuff you are. Now if I could just be left alone to farm on my own server without other people bothering me I could get the tedious farming over and done with and then go back to doing other stuff.<br />

We shouldn't be forced into MMO in every single aspect of the game because WoW has never been THIS immersed with multitudes of people in every area.. When I am out soloing (farming, questing, taking screenshots of my assend against a sunset) I WANT TO BE SOLO.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard undermined the levelling process long ago by making it so I can't go wrong if I fall asleep at my keyboard just as long as I keep a number key pressed. Getting rid of mob tagging could hardly make it less trivial and would get rid of lot of aggravation. What is the use of CRZ bringing more people in the levelling zones if that's the last thing we want to see because of game design?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're horde. You got CRZ disabled.<br />
Some other horde (B) on your realm is nearby.<br />
Horde B has CRZ active.<br />
<br />
Horde B gets attacked by someone from another realm.<br />
<br />
So no, it's not the least similar to running around with someone who's PvP flagged on a PvE realm, in the CRZ case you'd literally be watching your realm-kinsman die, and you can't even see the player attacking.<br />
<br />
Allowing CRZ just undermines the whole purpose. Sure, I can understand that people wants to turn it off for some reasons, like being safer while leveling or gathering without seeing someone from another realm snatch it, but no, this is a feature that should never be optional, and most likely never will be either.</div></div><hr />

Now i have to deal with twirps who cant handle a fair fight and (if you're a hunter) deal with the same BS spawn rates on rare pets with triple the amount of people camping them.

<br />
The people who are whining about CRZ are NOT the majority of players. Most people who like the feature makes no comment on it whatsoever, as they're busy enjoying the game as it should instead of whining and wasting their own time about a feature that's only going to improve the more iteration is done on it.<br />
<br />
Honestly, the moment most of the bugs and timezone issues are ironed out, I doubt people would even notice CRZ.<br />
<br />
Nope. Sorry buddy boy but that's just not true. See everyone I know in the game hates it. Not just dislikes it but doesn't really care, but actually hates the living crap out of it and complain constantly in gchat and realid statuses. None of them go to the forums. None of them come here. You just blindly thinking that because millions are out there playing the game and not complaining on the forums doesn't magically make them love crz. Maybe in your make believe world all inside your head, but the rest of us are centered in reality. <br />
<br />
Now go ahead, you can come back and claim everyone you know loves it. Doesn't really matter. You can tell by the forums what the people in the game feel. It's a lot like political polling or nielson ratings. Sure you're not getting every single persons opinion on it, but you're getting a percentage. And based on that you can tell what everyone thinks with a small margin of error. Based on the complaints, people hate crz and they hate daily rep grinding. That's a fact. It's not 100% sure. But it's enough that Blizzard should smarten up and listen or they repeat what happened in Cata. They were stubborn back then too and paid the price for it.</div></div><hr />

I mean there must be SOME reason you play an MMO, it can't just be, &quot;so I have an audience to show off my mounts and gear to&quot; is it? It seems like that is literally the only use people have for other players these days. &quot;Help me get my gear and achievements, and then worship me as a god as I sit on your mailboxes and bask you in my radiance.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and you can group cross realm with out CRZ so you can play with your friends so...<br />
<br />
False. Grouping cross-realm to quest together was not an option pre-CRZ, even with realID. You could only run instanced activities. Now you can group with people even without realID, outside of instances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's what this is all really about. People that *should* be on PvE realms are playing on PvP realms and haven't realised they made that mistake because Blizzard had made them almost exactly the same for so long (especially on realms like &quot;Thaurissan&quot; which was like 10+:1 in the horde to alliance ratio).<br />
<br />
All the other issues brought up will be solved in time but this &quot;problem&quot; will persist.<br />
<br />
I admit that I haven't played a lot recently (still got an active account but haven't played in any CRZs) but in theory this is *exactly* what an MMO should be (and will be from here on forwards if Blizzard sticks to their plan). It needs work but will pull through in the end. It's not a fundamentally flawed idea.... like real names on the forums!</div></div><hr />

MMO means playing with other players to achieve same goals. MMO doesn't mean playing against other players to achieve same goal unless it means some PvP activity (and WoW is primarily PvE-based game).<br />
<br />
When you do some 5-men, you play with other players to achieve same goal. When you go to mining node you play against other players to achieve same goal. When you have to wait in queue for mobs or barely see resource nodes or rares, it is not you, it is because other players are playing against you.<br />
<br />
With CRZ, thus whole overworld is against player, and not only just other faction, but multiple realms at once. People don't play games to stare at queue, wait for mob respawns, etc. If you enjoy such grieving kind of &quot;competition&quot;, you might have some serious problems you are not really aware of.<br />
<br />
But to embrace the sad truth, Actiblizzard won't remove CRZ. It allows them to cut expenses on hardware multiple times. They don't care about players' feedback on CRZ.</div></div><hr />

Before CRZ no high level would stay in Marshal's Refuge Ung'oro just in case a lost lowbie will show up. Now there probably are 10-20 low lvl chars of the opposite faction. I dont mind the quest competition or world pvp when engaged by similar level chars, but when a high lvl just comes and stomps you .. that is unpleasant.<br />
<br />
Yesterday I got to Area 52 with my lvl 67 shadow priest .. there were 3 lvl 90 alliance killing everyone. Instead of getting the quests I just did 3 dungeons and I'm 68 ready for wotlk and whatever awaits there. :) So basically instead of making people get back to the world, you are encouraged to spam dungeons.<br />
<br />
But I doubt they will remove CRZ, because it's a solution for them to use less hardware to host all zones on every server even though there is no one there. Before you had 50 Silithus areas on 50 servers for maybe 30 people ..now you can have just one. Maybe downscaling people to the level of the zone as done in GW2 would solve some issues. Then at least 2-3 lowbies can kill a downscaled <br />
lvl 90.<br />

In the end its just a necessary evil on your way to level 90. You just got to suck it up and do it.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, so now our server is full of strangers, but it's still dead and we can recruit none of the people we meet while leveling to our guild. So we have been forced by a dead server to drop 25 man half way through cataclysm to 10 man. And now there is still no solution.<br />

<br />
If Blizz want to continue having it here is some things wich would make people more happy abt it: get the spawn rate of materials (flowers and mines) and some rare spawns and mobs up and/or make the CRZ only for cross realm lvling in groups with the real ID or gamertag.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ofcourse. I've been playing on a PvP Realm since I've started playing World of Warcraft. The Cross-Realm Zones feature has been implemented to enhance leveling experience, which is - to be honest - totally bullshit, all I can see is level 90 characters everywhere, ganking low level toons.<br />
<br />
First of all, if they really want to improve the leveling experience, why don't they just share the zones with characters from other realms between the zone's advised level +- 2 levels for example.<br />
<br />
Secondly, some idiot kills me and I get there with my level 90 character. Even if I find him, most of the time they know how to abuse the system and when they get low on hp, they just disappear - in the middle of the zone, I was like &quot;Huh...?&quot;.<br />
<br />
This feature really needs to be revised, I have never ever been camped by high level noobs so many times like now. And no this is not PvP, even a 1 year old could kill a low level player with a level 90 character...</div></div><hr />

Yes, it's absolutely sensible for a company whose goal is to make money to not listen to its customer base. I really hope they drop something like 2 million subs the quarter after MoP release.<br />

As for the people who like CRZ, I frankly think you're trolling. I know *NO ONE* who likes CRZ. I know a few who appreciate the ability to group up with people across realms and quest, but the whole picture of CRZ, not so much.</div></div><hr />

This confuses me. You're playing an MMO. Perhaps single player games are more your style..?<br />
<br />
I mean there must be SOME reason you play an MMO, it can't just be, &quot;so I have an audience to show off my mounts and gear to&quot; is it? It seems like that is literally the only use people have for other players these days. &quot;Help me get my gear and achievements, and then worship me as a god as I sit on your mailboxes and bask you in my radiance.&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
False. Grouping cross-realm to quest together was not an option pre-CRZ, even with realID. You could only run instanced activities. Now you can group with people even without realID, outside of instances.[/QUOTE]<br />
<br />
I play an MMO to play with people i know in groups not hordes of people running amok. and there is very little benefit to group questing. unless you call having to kill 2-5 times as many mobs for the drops you all need &quot;Fun&quot;. but to each their own. I guess the Real ID / Battletag grouping was only for instances prior to MoP and I was incorrect in that information and thank you for informing me. <br />

Almost temped to find a high population Alliance PvP server just to move a 90 there to kill horde so the whiners who wanted world pvp get as much as they can manage :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
First, Phase higher level players, so there's a similar bracket to each zone as for BGs. this way, People 50 levels higher than intended for the zone can't gank lowbies. its bloody frustrating to be down in ungoro or Blasted lands and get camped by a 90 in greens that i KNOW i could roll on my main, but because of the distance from portals and such he can fly off before i can get down there, or before any of my guild members can get there. im sorry kids, GANKING a lvl 40-50 on your 90 is about as close to PvP as a MMA Fighter Slapping around a kid is close to a fair fight.<br />
<br />
And second: Make This CRZ stuff completely OPTIONAL.<br />
<br />
MY biggest peeve is Blizzard stated CRZ was to help lowpop servers when it does just the opposite. it hinders low pop servers and spreads people friom high pop servers out. and since i cant raid with the CRZ people then it does nothing at all the PVE scene.</div></div><hr />

I sure am. My server isn't dead or dying. My server is one of the original 13(14). We were doing just fine before being tossed in with a bunch of scrubs. From 2am PST until 6am PST, they were MY nodes. Now I am having to compete for fish, ore, battle pets, herbs, etc. I hate it.

<br />
My single grief with CRZ (I don't play on PvP servers) is having to fight other players from other servers for resource nodes.<br />
<br />
I don't mind fighting people from my server for nodes. If I wanted to farm lower level resources before CRZ, I'll either do it on off-hours or check the AH. Now both aspects are far more difficult with CRZ:<br />
<br />
1. Off-hours with CRZ? Good luck, even without time zone differential, you will never find an hour of the day when people aren't out there farming.<br />
<br />
2. The AH is now either over-inflated with lower level resources that are way too high priced (because they're far more rare now with CRZ), or there just isn't any because people aren't willing to fight CRZ to farm those nodes while leveling, etc.<br />
<br />
Again, I don't mind fighting people from my server for nodes. Because I know that either a) that person might later sell it on the AH and I'll be able to buy it from them or b) they're just there to farm up materials to level their skill and the server benefits from it. Either way, the node fighting benefits the server I'm on in some way (even if very minor). With CRZ, node fighting now means that the dude who just beat me to a node or snarfs it from underneath me while I'm fighting a nearby mob has just disappeared, and I'll never see them or the resources again in any form.<br />
<br />
CRZ is a huge negative to server economies.<br />
<br />
Replace resource nodes in this post with rare mob spawns, and it's basically the same argument.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crbrearley</div><div class="date">2012-10-31, 04:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm sure they'll eventually copy Guild Wars 2 and have no more fighting over resource nodes, mobs or quests. Makes leveling far better and you actually are happy that others are in your area.<br />
<br />
That would certainly help. I'd like to point out that the population in MMOs has always, to me, been a serious detriment. An absolute neccessity, since without raiding and PvP the game would dry up fairly quickly. But when I see GC talk about &quot;everybody ganking a single mob doesn't seem heroic&quot;, I cannot help thinking about my first reaction to MMOs. &quot;This can't make any sense at all. I play these games to feel heroic. How the hell can you fell heroic when there's 10,000 heroes around you?&quot; <br />
<br />
MMOs work despite, not because, of the group elements and the most successful MMO, Wow, emphasized a solo leveling and content. It made forming groups with strangers much easier for a group of people who are often anti-social in real life. I don't think having more people in a zone plays to the strength of this game.<br />
<br />
Making things difficult on a PvP server is hardly a problem from blizzard's perspective. If you really hate it, you'll probably switch servers or level a character on a PvE server and transfer. That's more money to them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niroshi</div><div class="date">2012-10-31, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If Blizzard would allow even normal mobs to use the tagging system of the larger quest mobs, say the Behemoth from the GL dailies, then the entire competition aspect of the CRZ would disappear. As someone who responded to me earlier said, yes, this would mean you could technically get a bunch of dudes together and AoE things down. I don't really consider this much of a problem, though, since we're really talking about a matter of convenience. In this case, I'd say get the game's annoying mechanics out of the way.<br />
<br />
One of the interesting things in Guild Wars 2 that Blizzard should consider copying for the remainder of this expansion, or at the very least their next expansion, is the atmosphere that a small change in philosophy like the above can bring. Rather than have a group of 20 people all trying to kill 12 Mogu in a fairly small area, competing and stepping all over each other with growing frustration, you would foster a somewhat more helpful community by removing the arbitrary restrictions that are built in to the way tagging works. If it's beneficial for a person to stop and help someone kill something, they'll do it. If it's not they won't.<br />
<br />
Most of the leveling quests aren't really designed to be a smooth experience with more than 1-2 people in the area, spawns are very slow and mobs are generally limited to far less than you need to complete your quest when more than one person is there. In this respect the entire CRZ was a bad idea, and I really hope it's refined before they implement it any further. It's nice to see people running around zones again, but when that comes with once again fighting for nodes, mobs, and items to simply complete quests, it feels less like an enjoyable trek down memory lane while leveling a new toon and more a constant exercise in frustration when you see even an allied faction character.</div></div><hr />

If you are one of the people who enjoys WoW because it's a multi-player game, then this will seem like a terrific feature. If instead, like me, you're one of the people who plays WoW in spite of the multi-player aspect, then this change is in the wrong direction. (Myself, I'd prefer an option to go into a completely instanced world.)<br />
<br />
Blizzard has got to be careful about the balance. Both sorts play WoW. Both sorts provide revenue for them. If they go fully down one path or the other, they make one segment of the player base considerably more happy, but may completely alienate another segment. They've got to (for financial reasons) continue walking a like where everybody is pretty frustrated, but not quite frustrated enough to actually quit.</div></div><hr />

With the removal of (virtually) all group quests, there is no reason for grouping.<br />
If we still had group quests, and HARD elite quests, then groups would be a good idea, and for that CRZ is exellent.. However, with solo-play being faster than group (due to xp penalty in groups) there is no reason to group with anyone else.<br />

<br />
You're playing WORLD of warcraft, Yes you experience a emersive world with quests and creatures and story, but it also brings another aspect, people. It's true that you will find people playing with their guildies and friends 90% of the time in low level zones if they want to be grouped, but I had a long day of boring labor one night, i was tired of working and just wanted to level my warrior, I found some nasty group quests in grizzly hills, since it was late at night and my server has been &quot;dying&quot; I would normally never ever ever get a reply in grizzly hills general of someone willing to help, nobody in my guild was on so i gave it a shot, thanks to CRZ there was a level 78 paladin in the area who easily helped me with the level 74 quests.<br />
<br />
It's examples like that which made me grow to really like CRZ, cool story bro or not, It's something that I found very useful.<br />
<br />
-I also enjoy the outskirts of Orgimmar, and Silvermoon, There's lots of dueling and pet battles that go on, where on my server there may of been 2 or 3 duels max out there, ...in cata...<br />
<br />
-People bitch all the time that &quot;VANILLA was THE BEST EVARRRR&quot; &gt;.&gt; You do realize that in vanilla there was a massive amount of ganking, Personally i enjoy it, it's mean, it sucks, but in the end its a passage, you get picked on til max level, you get gear, you go beat the guys ass if you ever see him, or you kill low levels of the opposing faction as payback. Sorry blizzard decided to listen. Maybe next time someone cries for Vanilla to come back we'll get unconnected flight paths.<br />

Also CRZ is awesome. Don't play on PVP realms if you can't handle it.</div></div><hr />

I now find myself leveling &quot;more efficiently&quot; by waiting 10minutes to queue for a dungeon that it is to go out there and hide from being seen by level 90's that will gank you over and over again like theres no tomorrow. <br />
<br />
This has to be the idea with the best intention and worst outcome blizzard has ever implemented. <br />
<br />
Blizz should look at taking similiar servers with a simliar make up and merge those, instead of merging a highly populated horde PVP server with a highly popoulated Alliance PVP server. I joined this highly populated alliance server to raid and it just happened to be a PVP server, so i think its not so bad, cause its mainly alliance. Then blizzard comes along and merges it with other highly populated horde servers and the end result...nobody enjoys leveling with horde and alliance bringing their lvl 90's to pawn lowbies.</div></div><hr />
