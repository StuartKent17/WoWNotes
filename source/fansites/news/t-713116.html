Zarhym announced that the new Battle.net integration will be integrated to the game before the release of Cataclysm. It could explain why we have to wait so long for Patch 3.3.5 and I guess it means that we won't see the Ruby Sanctum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/ruby-sanctum-info-compilation-preview/) before the release of Starcraft 2. <br />
This is exactly what we are working on implementing with Battle.net and real-life friends. You'll be able to add friends at the Battle.net account level and talk to them while in-game whether they're on the opposing faction, a different realm, or another Blizzard game entirely. This is coming prior to Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
[...] No one outside of your faction on your realm will be able to communicate with you unless you accept their friend request, or they accept yours. You will still have your normal World of Warcraft Friends list, but we'll be adding in the ability to have Battle.net players on your Friends list as well. The characters on your Friends list will allow the same communication functionality which exists today. It's only when you've confirmed someone as a Battle.net friend that you can take advantage of the additional communication features.<br />
<br />
We'll get more into that soon, but it's safe to say in advance that you shouldn't accept a Battle.net friend request from anyone you don't know, similar to Facebook or other social networking media.<br />
<br />
Along those lines, will it be possible to un-friend people from this list? Just because I accepted them as a friend at one point doesn't mean I'm interested in giving them info on me for the rest of my time with Blizzard.<br />
Definitely. <br />
<br />
I'll probably have to wait until then for an answer, but just in case: Does the Battle.net communication methods include private chat rooms with several friends at once? (And, even more specifically, persistent ones that will be autojoined upon logging in?)<br />
Private chat rooms are something to consider for the future of the system. Initially you will be able to invite up to five friends into a conversation.<br />
<br />
Please add the option to ignore someone's entire Battle.net account as well. I for one am sick and tired of ignore listing someone only to get bombarded with &quot;f**k u&quot; tells from 5-10 level 1 alts.<br />
We would like to do this in the future, but it likely won't be ready at release. You can block a Battle.net account, but that won't block all characters on that account's World of Warcraft license from messaging you. It's a technical limitation between the two systems which we'd like to overcome in time.<br />

Cataclysm Badge and PvP Point Changes Clarifications<br />
Here are some clarifications to some common concerns we're seeing:<br />
<br />
So this means that at some point I'm encouraged to stop playing because I know my current valor will convert to hero and I'll have a huge stockpile of points which I can then just use to buy the set I'd be after anyway.<br />
Our basic model throughout Wrath of the Lich King has been that you can get the shiny hotness now, or wait until it “goes on sale” next tier. In this example the set one would be after would be the old set and everyone else would be pursuing the new set.<br />
<br />
People should have to progress through more than just two tiers!<br />
They will, just not at the 4.0 stage. All we’re really doing with the badges is removing the need to keep adding new types every tier, which proved confusing.<br />
<br />
What is the valor total cap? (a little more than double the highest item point cost?)<br />
We haven’t made that determination yet. It will be something in line with how Honor works today; that is you can save up for expensive things but can’t have so many points that you can just rush out and get everything all at once and be done.<br />
<br />
What is the valor weekly cap?<br />
We haven’t made that determination yet. We want to pick a number such that you don’t feel compelled to complete all of the content every week just for points if you choose not to.<br />
<br />
What's the system/time between when a new raid is released and points are converted?<br />
Probably almost simultaneously. The points will be converted before new loot appears on the vendors.<br />
<br />
Why are rating requirements being removed?<br />
The current system has a touch of the rich-get-richer syndrome where players who lack the ratings can’t get the most competitive gear and feel like they have no hope of competing. Better players will still gear up much more quickly because they will have more points to spend. Rating requirements on, for example, weapons was pretty unpopular in the community.<br />
<br />
And won't this bring back the issues of people gearing weapons through PvP for raiding?<br />
PvP equipment spends a chunk of its budget on resilience so it’s always going to be sub-optimal for PvE compared to equivalent raiding gear. We don’t mind players using PvP gear in PvE (or vice versa) as long as it’s a stepping stone towards getting more appropriate gear.<br />
<br />
Why not have a 'heroic' equivalent for PvP gear?<br />
We are still tweaking item levels, but the basic concept is that there is the current season and there is the previous season. In this first season there is no previous season, so we also have to provide the “Honor gear.” That is supposed to be roughly equivalent to the pre-raiding tier that you’ll want for PvE before you begin raiding.<br />
<br />
Essentially all of the PvE changes together seem aimed to disincentivize 25s, is there some reasoning as to why 25s are no longer being encouraged?<br />
Our goal through Wrath of the Lich King was that players could choose 10 or 25 as a personal preference. We think we missed that mark though. Because 25s still provided more powerful rewards, it felt like that was the “real” raiding, and 10s were what you did on off-nights, or if you just couldn’t stomach the logistics of recruiting or pugging 10 more players. We know there are a lot of players out there who just prefer to raid 10s but felt like we didn’t deliver on our promise to let them just raid 10s. The Cataclysm model is to let players raid 10s or 25s as they see fit. There are advantages and disadvantages to both raid sizes. The larger raids can feel more epic, yet the smaller ones tend to have less loot drama because there is less competition per item that drops. The smaller raids in some sense are more hardcore, because there are fewer opportunities to include novice raiders or folks who just aren’t carrying their weight.<br />
<br />
We understand that changes like this can cause social upheaval and we didn’t make the decision lightly. The community was similarly concerned when we removed 40-player raids (and we literally did remove those; today we’re just offering an alternative to the larger raids). We think there is a non-trivial audience of players who prefer the 25-player raids and we’re going to continue to support them. We tried many different raiding models in Wrath of the Lich King with regard to Heroic modes and lockouts, and rest assured that if we don’t like how the 4.0 raiding game evolves that we will revisit it for 4.1.<br />
<br />
The term 'points' is not RP enough for PvE<br />
This is a legitimate concern and something we struggled with. On the other hand, one of the problems we kept running into with the current badges was granularity -- you can’t offer half a badge the way you can offer 1, 3 or 5 points. Depending on your perspective, you can argue that your character “earning”; valor for defeating an enemy makes more sense in the game world than the dragon having all of these badges on its corpse. <br />

AE'ing your way through instances<br />
Right. You shouldn't be AE'ing every pull in the Cataclysm version of Naxxramas, at least until the Cataclysm version of Ulduar is available.<br />
<br />
Players were wiping in the heroic dungeons more, up until they had all of their easy Naxx loot, at which point they could blast through the heroics.<br />
<br />
There will still be some AE pulls. AE pulls are fun and they give you a chance to use some different abilities. But what we want is variety so that you actually stop to think about whether the next pull requires single-target, CC or AE (or some mix) rather than doing the same thing every time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401906536/we-will-still-be-aoe-nuking-heroics-in-cata/))<br />
<br />
Healing Spells<br />
Spells need to be distinct in order to have a reason for players to cast them. If spell A healed the same and cost the same as spell B, then what is the point of B? Spells without cooldowns generally can't be as powerful as spells with cooldowns, or else you would never have a reason to use the latter. It would be easy to make a 1 min cooldown heal that was overpowered. It would also be easy to make a 1 min cooldown heal that was useless. The challenge is in making that spell something you're happy to cast when available, and ideally not the second it's available but when it's the most useful.<br />
<br />
I know some players can't see beyond &quot;nerf!&quot; and there's not much I'm going to be able to do to change their minds. Other healers will hopefully understand that the goal is to make healing more interesting and fun for them by letting them choose which of their many heals to use instead of having one heal that can solve so many different problems. Sometimes you literally need to heal 5 or 6 players at once to prevent imminent death. Perfect job for WG / CoH. Not every situation falls into that category though and in those cases where it's just several players below 100% health, the smart AE heals don't have to be the only option there.

Worgen/Troll Cat and Bear Forms<br />
We're working to get unique art for worgen and troll druid cat and bear forms. As with the current races' cat and bear forms, these two forms for worgen and trolls should feel unique to each race, but still not stray entirely from cat and bear forms. That's the current plan anyway. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401527225/the-worgen-troll-druid-thread-to-end-them-all/))</div></div><hr />

We had one ten man group near the top of progression, one not terribly far behind, and one ambling along at their own pace. Those three combined to form some bad 25s, as 12-15 good raiders could not carry 10-13 poor ones. Most of us really had no desire to run 25s, myself included, but there was always that one piece of gear that was so much better that we felt the need to attempt them.

You lost your friends over gear? :S I think it's a pretty stupid argument that you are forced into 25 man raids because they drop better gear. Gear that you don't even need to do what you want to do. Gear that trivializes (for a part) the content that you want to do.<br />
<br />
And if half your guild wants to do 10 man and the other half wants to do 10 man and 25 man then you should split up or arrange something. They can't force you to do 25 man raids. And if they would kick you for not joining the 25 man raids then they are not good friends anyway.<br />
<br />
Get that beta started. I want to see!</div></div><hr />

Basically the cross faction thing is for people like me who will be playing both Alliance and Horde so your guildies or friends from one side or the other can contact you regardless of faction, server or blizzard game. Actually I am almost 100% sure that they are creating a Steam like application in which you can chat to your Battle.net friends anytime you want to whether in a game or not.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like my last guild. Ultimately, it gave me a sour taste for 25 man raiding... especially considering I was always the one switching rolls to suit the needs of the 25 man (I played a druid for the longest time, switching between tank, heals, or DPS as needed to suit raid comp). <br />
<br />
6 or 7 of us ended up leaving a couple months ago when it got just unbearably stupid, and we've just been trying to relax and enjoy ourselves until Cataclysm when we'll probably start recruiting. It is funny though, we pick up 4-5 people from another guild to split the raids, and we're already further progressed in ICC with this 10 man mix group than we were with out old guild &quot;progression&quot; group.</div></div><hr />

It could explain why we have to wait so long for Patch 3.3.5 and I guess it means that we won't see the Ruby Sanctum before the release of Starcraft 2. <br />
I thought we would get Ruby Sanctum in two months or so..... and Starcraft 2 around Xmass (more or less at least). Now I have no clue what that means. Will we get SC2 THAT soon, or Ruby Sanctum will land after New Year...... and what with Cata release date ? O.o<br />

They are catering to people who like to PvP and PvE, currently if you want to do both you kinda have to pick one and stick with it becasue of the rating system unless you want to spend like 5 hours a day every day playing WoW to do both well. It's definitely a casual change but it also helps in PvE when weapons drop the least and people like me who have 8 80's and want weapons that arent blue pieces of garbage (especially for the classes who do damage based on weapons) This helps get a foothold in PvE as well as PvP.</div></div><hr />

Its not about getting rid of it, 25 man is great if your guild can do it, its a guild choice, Cataclysm is 100% geared towards guilds and less pugging. The Guild talent trees reflect this as well as the shared lockout. They want 10 or 25 man to be a guild choice.</div></div><hr />

There is no choice. Ppl will take the path of less resistance. If 10 man is where you get loot fastest and easiest ppl will go there and if 25 man is where you get loot fastest and easiest ppl will go there. Tuning it so it the difficulty is the same is impossible.</div></div><hr />

I think its becasue once we all move onto the next set of raid gear with the new 10 man, the 25 mans previous raid tier is still going to be looking good, so if your guild has gotten lets say 50% of their upgrades from the new 10 man they can go back to the old triers 25 man and still get useful stuff out of it and it will be a little easier to handle with the new gear. That is just one of many reasons this could be helpful, so people don't pass up doing older content as much.</div></div><hr />

Healing, tanking, and dps will all be quite a bit more difficult, you wont see any roflpwning shit off the bat this time, especially with the reintroduction of CC, even if the 10 man is less resistance it still is going to be a hell of a lot more challenging in Cat.</div></div><hr />

But with the direction we are going, I´m not really suprised if they actually take 25man away and instead focus on the 10man.</div></div><hr />

Now gear isn't an issue (or excuse)... skill will rise, those without will be easily exposed regardless of what they have for gear. If you are better you will still have your titles, ratings, mounts and whatever they add in as &quot;cosmetic rewards&quot;. Not to mention you will also gear out a lot quicker with higher ratings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
tl;dr same loot from 10 and 25 = less dev time on loot and more on important game-making/breaking changes.<br />

Gear that you don't even need to do what you want to do. Gear that trivializes (for a part) the content that you want to do.<br />
<br />
And if half your guild wants to do 10 man and the other half wants to do 10 man and 25 man then you should split up or arrange something. They can't force you to do 25 man raids. And if they would kick you for not joining the 25 man raids then they are not good friends anyway.<br />
<br />
Get that beta started. I want to see!<br />
<br />
<br />
I wasn't really the one going after the gear. There weren't enough folks to raid 25s without those of us who didn't really want to run them (most of us being officers, and therefore forced by conscience to go &quot;for the good of the guild&quot;). There was no kick imminent, the guild broke up mainly because we were bleeding people who wanted a free ride through 25s and a lot of personal drama that ensued. Had 10s been viable as a gear progression path, the issues would likely have either never occurred or been ignorable.<br />
<br />
But they weren't. Frankly, neither were 25s. If you strictly ran one or the other, you'd have holes in your gear, slots where an item from the other raid is preferable to the one you have. And it does go both ways, as in the current tier there are bracers from 10 mans that beat any from 25s for me. Trinkets, especially, will oftentimes be completely useless on one tier and perfectly itemized on the other.</div></div><hr />

The whole idea of arena is competitive pvp... you should enjoy it for the competition, the fun of beating other teams and showing you are better, because you enjoy pvp etc. Not purely because u want gear... Why do you think the best arena teams fight so hard to get gladiator title? They don't get any gear for doing so.</div></div><hr />

Why would you think SC2 is coming out that late? The beta for it has been going on a few months now and it's getting close to wrapping up. Just look at the various gaming news sites for the last couple weeks and Blizzard has been releasing tons of info on the game, including whole ingame movies from the single player campaign and even released one showing off a whole mission being played thru...<br />

It'll be an early Summer release. And I still expect Cata to come out in September.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't worry me in the bit, what's it matter in the end, hardcore world first style guilds will still field 25s and won't care about normal mode crap, this just allows more access by groups of dedicated friends to do what they love and not rely on 15 other people to show up or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True. Requirements are needed period. If there are no requirements then all PvP people will HAVE TO go PvE Heroic Raids to get their weapons since it will be 1 tier above it. If there are no rating requirements their will not be a tier 2 PvP weapon which is a fail.</div></div><hr />

It will take far more BGs to get a piece of gear. Triumph badges are the ultimate form of welfare, yet there's actually people that don't know that and still think PvP is the way to get easy gear. <br />
<br />
And the man that thought PvP gear should have ratings is gone (Tigole, Mr.Low-Self-Esteem). He didn't want people gearing up through PvP and having big shoulder armor (which he thought showed off the size of your dick), so he wanted ratings implemented to stop it.

Yea... cuz skill is based on the number of hours you stand in front of a PC...<br />
<br />
FOR GOD SAKE the Arena concept is brilliant, You do not need to stay hours and hours and days in front of a PC to get in top PvP you need to win the minimum of 10 games per week. In order to win you must play in a good setup (true not all setups work) but more than that you need to be GOOD.<br />
<br />
Last season I got to 2.1k on Rogue, Mage , Resto Shammy. Is it a excellent Setup ? NO but hell we played games and won them! And when I mean win games I don't mean doing 100 hours per week of PvP and get 50% victories like old days BGs. I mean a total of 200 games in a entire Season and win a huge chunk of them.<br />

<br />
FOR GOD SAKE the Arena concept is brilliant, You do not need to stay hours and hours and days in front of a PC to get in top PvP you need to win the minimum of 10 games per week. In order to win you must play in a good setup (true not all setups work) but more than that you need to be GOOD.<br />
<br />
Last season I got to 2.1k on Rogue, Mage , Resto Shammy. Is it a excellent Setup ? NO but hell we played games and won them! And when I mean win games I don't mean doing 100 hours per week of PvP and get 50% victories like old days BGs. I mean a total of 200 games in a entire Season and win a huge chunk of them.<br />
<br />
Just my 2 cents,<br />
<br />
Shockamos, Grim Batol<br />
100% true.<br />
Free for all concept is fail. PLayers dont want it, pve players dont want it, pvp players dont want it. Player who is better (better=better skill, who know how play char, who have better guild / team or whatever) deserve better &quot;gear&quot;, better dps in raids or more kills in BG. Rest of players have MOTIVATION for playing.<br />
<br />
Mindless farming HC for emblems or farming BG for emblems (in cata) and buying gear without rat. req. is so booooooooooooooooooooooooring.<br />
Maybe time to leave wow and focus SC2 ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they had the same level loot but didn't share a lockout, you'd have people geared up and done with the dungeon in a week.<br />
<br />
There is now going to be a dedicated progression, you only do 10s or you only do 25s. You wouldn't be able to &quot;learn the fight&quot; on 10 man before going into 25, as for one, they would wipe just as much in 10s as they would in 25 since the difficulty will be tuned tighter and for two you wouldn't be able to grab 8 25 man geared folks to train the two people by outgearing the fight.<br />
<br />
And let's face it, if two people are killing your 25 man encounter, you have bigger issues.</div></div><hr />

The current system has a touch of the rich-get-richer syndrome where players who lack the ratings can’t get the most competitive gear and feel like they have no hope of competing. Better players will still gear up much more quickly because they will have more points to spend. Rating requirements on, for example, weapons was pretty unpopular in the community.<br />

<br />
But finally the raid setup looks greats.<br />
<br />
I think the goal of the 10/25 man raids is perfect, and I don't think it will be like now with 10 man being the easier version of 25 man, personally I think 10 man will be more punishing on tanks/healers at least.<br />
<br />
But if gives the option at least, that if you can't manage a 25 man that week, that a 10 man is available, for the same reward.<br />
<br />
Still, one issue I am far from convinced on is rated BG's. I don't think there is a value in &quot;rating&quot; puggers, since you will get lucky morons killing for the sake of killing with no idea/effort put towards winning.<br />
<br />
One last thing on PvP weapons, this game is meant to be approachable from any points, its why people still play it, they can take a break and come back after 6 months, and it takes them &lt;a couple of weeks to get up to speed. That's good, provides healthy competition. While anyone whining about &quot;bad&quot; players getting good weapons in pvp is quite foolish, are they afraid of being beaten by &quot;bad&quot; players? (maybe only the top 10 teams should be allowed to use pvp gear, and all the people who have no chance at gaining rewards, having no chance at gaining no rewards)</div></div><hr />

We are still tweaking item levels, but the basic concept is that there is the current season and there is the previous season. In this first season there is no previous season, so we also have to provide the “Honor gear.” That is supposed to be roughly equivalent to the pre-raiding tier that you’ll want for PvE before you begin raiding.<br />

<br />
You have to think like a developer, not a player. <br />
<br />
As a player, you are thinking &quot;is it so bad that I can earn gear faster if I run both raids? Nah, not really.&quot;<br />
<br />
The developer has already thought this through though. They set the bar (aka, the price of the items) for gear acquisition somewhere around the highest rate. What this means for you is if you do NOT run both raid types, do your heroics, and do side raids that offer the top emblems, you aren't gearing as fast as they planned for you too. They are okay with people gearing slower than they should, but NOT faster, because that burns out the content faster and burns out players faster.<br />
<br />
By introducing caps on points and putting the raid IDs into one, they establish a much lower bar. They can set prices lower on items. Instead of getting stressed that you didn't get your 10 man raid done one week and are now behind in gear, you can relax more. The game is supposed to be a fun thing to do with friends, not a stressful experience.<br />
<br />
In the current system, you aren't getting ahead by running multiple versions of the same raid, you are falling behind by not. The falling behind feeling is what the majority of the playerbase feels when they only have a couple nights a week to play.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ComputerNerd</div><div class="date">2010-04-28, 04:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">One thing I wish for with this whole valor/honor point system is that they visually represent with a reputation bar like UI element. This allows me (and others ofc :D) to visually see how close/far their points are to the cap. Small change and minor benefit but a helluva lot of aesthetic improvement.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is an interesting possiblility, one which was long overdue for the honor cap.<br />
There are ofc likely to be broker/fubar addons and similar which will provide that function in the form of x/y points, but a built in indication of the progress towards, and of the actual cap would be nice.<br />
<br />
On a side note, the points were described as not very roleplay friendly, but then again neither were emblems which exactly matched the number eligable to loot them.<br />
A 10 man with 8 people would be 8 emblems, not the usual 10 where 2 just disappared and so on. 2 disappearing emblems which would otherwise be distributed to random members would be a nice incentive to run a raid with smaller numbers, besides less loot competition, achievements, and something to compete for other than gear once it is overgeared.<br />
Then again having multiple emblems in the first place or 1 lootable head for each person with a quest did not exactly make roleplay sense either.<br />
The entire concept of the loot is even worse, so I think those who don't like the points over emblems are being hypocritical over it considering a large dragon can drop loot which happens to fit someone in the raid, is of no actual use to said dragon, and it happened to carry round a large empty bag, seemingly for said loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Completely avoiding the question much? <br />
<br />
<br />
Hardly what I would call avoiding the question.<br />
As raid/dungeon content goes up in effective difficulty due to gear requirements, we do not get that in seasons because it does not make sense.<br />
PVP gear as tiers does not make sense either, where the season from which gear was the &quot;good stuff&quot; does make more sense in terms of a progression of the gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it really that big of a deal that players can get extra emblems / points from doing 2 raids a week? I think not!!!<br />
<br />
Not a case of the extra emblems, though that was an unfair advantage that bigger guilds had, offering them a means of furthering the gap between tham and anyone else with smaller numbers.<br />
You should gear up faster and better because you earn it, not because there are more of you.</div></div><hr />

To add someone here he has to confirm (like Facebook). This is the one that will work cross-game and cross-server in WoW. Shows your real name because it's meant for your REAL friends.<br />

<br />
I agree to a certain extent, but the same standard is not applied to PvE.<br />
<br />
With heroic modes of raids, there is a two-tiered system to the item level you can obtain. This is not leaving with Cataclysm and it will mean that if all pvp gear has no rating requirements, and the quality of the PvP gear is on par with normal modes, than players who obtain heroic quality PvE gear will have an advantage over equally skilled PvP'rs. <br />
<br />
This oversight diminishes the integrity of the &quot;even playing field&quot; that they are attempting to create with the removal of rating requirements. If you ask me it's either:<br />
<br />
ALL: Remove ALL PvE gear from competitive PvP environments - rated BGs and Arenas)*<br />
or <br />
NONE: Keep the two tiered PvP gear system as it currently stands, allowing rating requirement weapons to be of heroic quality.<br />
<br />
* This would have to be accompanied by a wider selection of trinkets and accessories for players to itemize for their spec.</div></div><hr />

I did few arenas in my life, but this change is retarded. Actually if you are a good and skilled player in arena you get rewarded with a shiny armor and so on. In Cata if you are a skilled player in arena you'll get rewarded with a shiny armor and so on, if you are not so skilled player you will get a shiny armor on so on later than skilled players?<br />
<br />
Not only they gave welfare equip for pve purpose, now they will give for pvp too? I hope i'm mistaken but i think Blizzard is trying to give every player the same stuff without putting much effort. You'll know you will get rewarded regardless your skill with the same equip of better players sooner or later...<br />

Only question remaining is, why. Catering to that fraction of &quot;strict 10 man raiders&quot; who cant sleep at night horrid by fact that 25 man raiders get better loot?<br />
<br />
Simply sharing the lockout would have kept people separate. 25 raiders couldnt use 10s to practice, nor could they rolfstomp 10 mans in 25 gear and talk about &quot;10 mans are way too easy&quot;. (While 10 man raids are inherently easier on most encounters.).<br />
They wanted to battle gear inflation? That with above makes announced change a &quot;elegant solution&quot;, but still, it could have been done otherwise.<br />
<br />
10M Tier 11 iL 300<br />
10M HC Tier 11 iL 304<br />
25M Tier 11 iL 308<br />
25M HC Tier 11 iL 312<br />
<br />
10M Tier 12 iL 313... and so on.<br />
<br />
It can all be same loot with different stats to ease the design. And they have to design and test and fine tune 4 different encounters anyway, 10M, 10M HC, 25M, 25M HC... no matter the gear they are different encounters number wise.<br />
<br />
Anyway, keeping iL separation from 10M normal to 25M HC gear to 14 or 16 at most, we could end Cata with 5 tiers of gear ending up iL 380. Tightening it to 10 or 12 (and maybe making 10M HC = 25M normal) 5 tiers of gear end with iL 360</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason 10s feel easier than 25s is because they arent balanced appropriately (They say they will) and you can use better gear from the 25s to roflstomp them. I do feel 25 should have a worthwhile incentive other than it &quot;feeling more epic&quot; because thats just a lame excuse in itself. I believe its a lot more difficult to find 24 people in the first place and to rely on each and every single one of them the do their job correctly than just relying on 9 people in a 10m. What is even more difficult is trying to coordinate with and strategize with 24 other people vs 9 other people in a 10m encounter.<br />
<br />
Another thing that separates them for a few fights is the distance requirements and spacing needed for some encounters. It is a lot easier to find a spot in a 10m for Saurfang than in 25m. <br />
<br />
Will the maps scale with raid size? <br />
<br />
I really like the way raiding is now because its all I've known since I started raiding 9/2009. I love how 10m can actually help your gearing by being able to find something that has the exact stats you want that might not be available in a 25m encounter. (Reforging hopefully solves this issue) <br />
<br />
I really hope Blizz can find a better incentive to doing 25m content other than the opinion of it &quot;feeling more epic&quot;. I'm pretty confident they will though =)<br />

Make legendary items available to 25m only<br />
Vanity awards (Ironbound Protos etc.)<br />
Force attunements for 10m but not 25m<br />
Add extra bosses to 25m with same tier level items<br />
Add small bonuses to gear (procs or effects)<br />
Add unique changes for the content (25m LK vs H25m LK Frostmourne room)<br />
<br />
<br />
It really appears the main concern 10m raiders and Blizz have are the loot differences between differing player size in raids,<br />
IMO just add more cool shit to 25m and ppl will at least be satisfied.</div></div><hr />

If it works one way, it likely works the other.<br />

You're probably going to consider this rude, so I'll apologize ahead of time.<br />

AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAAAHHAAHA<br />

Prices aren't going to go down one goddamned red cent. They're only going to go up. The fact that games on STEAM are the same prices (barring sales) as they would be in a completely physical package should tell you that right there.</div></div><hr />

Please add the option to ignore someone's entire Battle.net account as well. I for one am sick and tired of ignore listing someone only to get bombarded with &quot;f**k u&quot; tells from 5-10 level 1 alts.<br />
We would like to do this in the future, but it likely won't be ready at release. You can block a Battle.net account, but that won't block all characters on that account's World of Warcraft license from messaging you. It's a technical limitation between the two systems which we'd like to overcome in time.<br />
Hope this will be included asap nothing is more irritating than some jerk whispering you for 2 hours on different alts cause you killed him :-X .</div></div><hr />

This is a legitimate concern and something we struggled with. On the other hand, one of the problems we kept running into with the current badges was granularity -- you can’t offer half a badge the way you can offer 1, 3 or 5 points. Depending on your perspective, you can argue that your character “earning”; valor for defeating an enemy makes more sense in the game world than the dragon having all of these badges on its corpse. <br />

Lol, what?<br />
<br />
PvE doesn't care about &quot;RP&quot;.... We care about points.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only reason 10s feel easier than 25s is because they arent balanced appropriately (They say they will) and you can use better gear from the 25s to roflstomp them. I do feel 25 should have a worthwhile incentive other than it &quot;feeling more epic&quot; because thats just a lame excuse in itself. I believe its a lot more difficult to find 24 people in the first place and to rely on each and every single one of them the do their job correctly than just relying on 9 people in a 10m. What is even more difficult is trying to coordinate with and strategize with 24 other people vs 9 other people in a 10m encounter.<br />
<br />
Another thing that separates them for a few fights is the distance requirements and spacing needed for some encounters. It is a lot easier to find a spot in a 10m for Saurfang than in 25m. <br />
<br />
Will the maps scale with raid size? <br />
<br />
I really like the way raiding is now because its all I've known since I started raiding 9/2009. I love how 10m can actually help your gearing by being able to find something that has the exact stats you want that might not be available in a 25m encounter. (Reforging hopefully solves this issue) <br />
<br />
I really hope Blizz can find a better incentive to doing 25m content other than the opinion of it &quot;feeling more epic&quot;. I'm pretty confident they will though =)<br />

<br />
The whole point is allowing players to do what they want and giving reasonable rewards for similarly tuned content. If you give super special rewards to people who do 25s, then no one will want to do 10s. 25s have more people, so all they need is a slightly bigger reward (2.5 times gear, slightly extra &quot;valor points&quot;). They're trying to strike a balance between incentivizing 25 mans and making it the only option. Putting legendaries in 25 mans would pretty much make it the only option. <br />
<br />
Putting in legendaries that start as quest drops from hard modes would be much more reasonable than as drops in normal 25 man play. Legendaries should be legendary.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceara</div><div class="date">2010-04-28, 09:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why are rating requirements being removed?<br />
The current system has a touch of the rich-get-richer syndrome where players who lack the ratings can’t get the most competitive gear and feel like they have no hope of competing. Better players will still gear up much more quickly because they will have more points to spend. Rating requirements on, for example, weapons was pretty unpopular in the community.<br />
<br />
And won't this bring back the issues of people gearing weapons through PvP for raiding?<br />
PvP equipment spends a chunk of its budget on resilience so it’s always going to be sub-optimal for PvE compared to equivalent raiding gear. We don’t mind players using PvP gear in PvE (or vice versa) as long as it’s a stepping stone towards getting more appropriate gear.<br />

:/ In the game world, wolves carry daggers around and bears carry chestpieces. Maybe Blizzard haven't realised this yet. And they get confused in their own lore and I swear bits of lore in places are even just missing completely. They don't care about us RPers and Lore-fans. :c<br />

Worgen/Troll Cat and Bear Forms<br />
We're working to get unique art for worgen and troll druid cat and bear forms. As with the current races' cat and bear forms, these two forms for worgen and trolls should feel unique to each race, but still not stray entirely from cat and bear forms. That's the current plan anyway. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24401527225/the-worgen-troll-druid-thread-to-end-them-all/))<br />
<br />
<br />
And, even though I did expect it, I still find werewolves with bear and cat forms kinda weird.</div></div><hr />

Of course it is easy when you're running it with one tier higher than you're supposed to... but I remember clearly that firefighter, yogg saron with 1 keeper, algalon, anub'arak heroic and so forth were pretty nice and rewarding fights when you finally managed to beat them.<br />
<br />
Also, to all those that think that 10m is always easier than 25m, i wish to recall you OS 3 drakes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Am I tripping here when I think that the majority of RAIDERS prefer 25-mans, not only because of the loot, but because of complexity and synergy between classes? Being the only rogue in raid kinda sucks tbh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is now going to be a dedicated progression, you only do 10s or you only do 25s. You wouldn't be able to &quot;learn the fight&quot; on 10 man before going into 25, as for one, they would wipe just as much in 10s as they would in 25 since the difficulty will be tuned tighter and for two you wouldn't be able to grab 8 25 man geared folks to train the two people by outgearing the fight.<br />
<br />
And let's face it, if two people are killing your 25 man encounter, you have bigger issues.<br />
<br />
<br />
What an absolute load of rubbish! People atm can do 10 and 25 man and do they get all loot within a week? NO!!!<br />
All I am saying is compared to now, instead of making it really hard to get emblems/points by sharing lockouts why not just make it a little bit harder by having same loot in the raids but don't share the same lockout. Really seems pointless killing off 25 man raiding and making it a lot harder to gear up!</div></div><hr />
