Patch 8.0.1 Hotfixes - September 14th<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
Substantially increased the drop rates for the various bonus rewards, such as transmog items, pets, quest starters, and mounts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Player versus Player<br />
<br />
Starting next week, earning 500 Conquest in a week, regardless of the status of your weekly Rated PvP quest, will also make you eligible for a weekly PvP reward chest. It is strongly recommended that you complete a Rated PvP quest this week to ensure your eligibility for the next chest.<br />
Weekly Conquest rewards now display the correct item level inside PvP instances.<br />
All ranks of Battleborn Sigil and Warlord's Trophy should now function as intended and are usable on any Dread Gladiator's item of lower item level.<br />
Fixed a bug that made it possible to receive a lower item-level item than intended from PvP bonus rolls.<br />

ground or flying mount?<br />
Kua'fon. i finished his quest line and got the achievement. but as it turns out, it's only a ground mount, even tried it in orgimmar. i want to know if thats how it's supposed to be, or is there some sort of bug? because it would be much cooler if it can fly. P.S, can the zandalari exalted mount fly? or is it only a ground mount as well?<br />
As the yellow flavour text on the item says, poor little Kua'fon never did learn to fly... No soaring through the skies for him! The Zandalari Empire Pterrordax is a flying mount though. Enjoy your new dino mount. (Blue Tracker[/b] (]Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17623892622?page=1#2))</div></div><hr />

<br />
And how do you propose Ion fix an issue that he inherited? Faction imbalance in raiding has been this drastic since Highmaul/BRF when the ratio was 78/22, which was before Ion was even Lead Encounter Designer let alone Game Director. The issue resulted from horde racials being better for PVE at the time Blizz switched raiding paradigm to the Mythic focus, pushing for harder difficulty. Top PVE players switched to Horde to gain marginal benefits 4 years ago, and players since then have gone horde because they want to play with the top PVE players, who are mostly horde.<br />
<br />
Blizz has actually worked to try to reduce the power imbalance that horde racials had caused, but they can't exactly force guilds to switch back to Alliance when there is no incentive to. Guilds won't faction change unless there is actually a power skew in one direction, which is what caused the historic shift to horde. <br />
<br />
You want faction power balance, which we are actually closer to right now btw, but also want even Horde/Alliance ratios in PVE. The latter can't happen unless Blizz buffs alliance racials to be better than horde (thus encouraging guilds to switch), which obviously prevents the former from happening.</div></div><hr />

because it's purchasable with gold now through the b.net tokens?<br />
although if they weren't absolute misers they've offer limited-time free-use of the services from time to time to try and balance this out.<br />
you know, the same way they offered free realm transfers in the past to try and balance it out.</div></div><hr />

because many of them were originally one then went the other because of fucking pushing into world top helps draw new quality players.<br />
so you assuming they don't have less then min/max mythic friends back on their prior faction is disingenuous.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh yes his species is known to fly, but it is rather common for birds to not learn or be able to fly.<br />
however in nature those ones are the ones that usually go... splat...<br />
