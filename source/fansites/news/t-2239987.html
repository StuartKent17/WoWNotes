That statement alone, all by itself just dictated the outcome of the first mythic kill, meaning...'who cares' we already etc. and so on. Not to mention the care factor of cinematic concerning 'talking over' which I agree was very unprofessional but it shows the entire care factor of the entire game, &quot;We got our face time with first kill&quot; is all that matters, *shrug*</div></div><hr />

Let's take legal matters out of the equation.<br />
<br />
You can't personally see (proc this cinematic after defeating kiljaeden) this cinematic because of x or y.<br />
Someone else can and shows it to you in whatever quality they happen to record it in.<br />
These people are doing those that want to see this a favour by allowing them to see it.<br />
<br />
Then people (that have not been able to see this video in the proper &quot;channel&quot;) whine about the quality or disturbances in said video.<br />
It's super, super sad.<br />
<br />
Comparison is about stringing both subjects together, ofcourse there are some things that they don't share with one-another.<br />
Otherwise why compare them in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Wrong. Cinematics are always encrypted until the first boss kill triggers it's unlock.<br />
<br />
The only time where it wasn't encrypted was nighthold and that was due to a mistake on their end.<br />

All the other cinematics have always been encrypted, unless Blizzard didn't care.</div></div><hr />

and it has only been a few hours since servers went live so<br />
also ever heard of encryption, literally the game did not have the cinematic (saying it an easy way) until somone got the kill<br />
<br />

<br />
Teleport a giant full fel planet near another planet using only a Felshard (not really a felshard), and Azeroth suffers no harm of the gravitation change and fel energies of Argus... well Blizzard, that was really stupid.

<br />
it was the sargerite keystone, a super powerful artifact, also it didnt happen instanrtly, you can see the space warping as it takes for fucking ever to happen<br />
also no we would not feel the change right away, and no the planet is still super far away, just it is now visable...<br />
<br />
<br />
just cause we can see the sun does that mean we should be burnt to a crisp by its fire?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Velen touching Kil'Jaeden's forehead makes me think that the light granted the Eredar one last vision that perhaps the future was not yet played. With Argus incoming, there is still hope.<br />
<br />
Too bad we didn't get to see Kil'Jaeden on our side. Would've been badass.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it was Velen showing that he forgives him. I think deep down somewhere both of them still care about each other. Kil'jaeden wished he had the faith that Velen has.</div></div><hr />

I thought it was cool that blizzard used this as his plan has finally come to transition. <br />
<br />
The only thing I don't get, is argus classed as part of the nether? This looks like we actually kill him for good as he is saying his sort of goodbyes. I was under the understanding that unless killed in the nether he would come back. That's why mythic archimond was in the nether. What we can expect of mythic Kill'J too??</div></div><hr />

It may see forced but being the Deceiver and all, usually you find that people do the exact opposite's very well like Robin Williams was depressed for years but could make everyone laugh and hide it so well.<br />
<br />
Makes the Argus patch a little more obvious and to me Sargeras being in it seems less likely now but who knows! <br />
<br />
Also, I know people are associating it with Dr. Who and such... But basically this is exactly how the Dark Portals prior worked just visually in game was lacking, back then it couldn't show it through the graphics which set a standard and why it wasn't modernised.<br />

archimondes mythic phase death is canon, he's dead.<br />
<br />
and kil'jaeden died near argus, heavily fel saturated places have the same effect on demons as the twisting nether.<br />
besides that, his ship warps through the twisting nether to get to different locations, it being connected to it wouldnt be a surprise.</div></div><hr />

It makes perfect sense actually. If you think of it in a coldly rational way, no power on the cosmos could defeat Sargeras. KJ just made the call that whatever he might do, Sargeras would win, so might as well join him.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;The only way to kill demons permanently was to slay them in the Nether, or in areas of the Great Dark saturated with that volatile realm's energies.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Chronicles Volume 1 pg. 23&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Demon souls are tethered to the Twisting Nether and as such, even if a demon dies in the physical universe, their spirit will return to the Nether where they will reform once again. To truly destroy a demon, the creature must be killed in the Nether itself, in places where it bleeds into mortal worlds, or in areas saturated with fel energies. Demons normally delight in inflicting suffering, spreading corruption and destroying all that is good. Mortal beings can be turned into demons themselves by being infused with fel energy, the dark and corrupting essence wielded by the Burning Legion.&quot;<br />

Velen touching Kil'Jaeden's forehead makes me think that the light granted the Eredar one last vision that perhaps the future was not yet played. With Argus incoming, there is still hope.<br />

Too bad we didn't get to see Kil'Jaeden on our side. Would've been badass.<br />

i was pretty sad, i felt bad for kiljaden as this paints him more of like how elisande was &quot;i had to, to save my people, it was join him or die, i did not see the possability that we could beat him&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
like kiljaden and elisande both chose to join sargeras/the legion because they could not see them as being able to fight back and had to join, it is a tough situation, yes he was a bad guy, but from what it seems, like elisande, he was forced, i am sad we had to kill elisande, during beta she lived and helped us</div></div><hr />

<br />
mythic is cannon over heroic, but archimonde for example people like to say died in the nether but no he died on draenor<br />
cinematic shows him on draenor, and his body you loot is on draenor, meaning just before he dies he teleports back to draenor, stopping you from perma killing him<br />
<br />

Stop using Bollywood scenarists as your script writers.<br />
Who came up with the fancy idea of 'reformed KJD'? The derp that stole Velen's son and turned him against the father for the sole purpose of petty revenge? Are you absolutely out of your minds? You took the most sinister, vile and overall antagonistic character sans Sarge himself and turned him into a whiny kid. Have you absolutely no decency?<br />

It may see forced but being the Deceiver and all, usually you find that people do the exact opposite's very well like Robin Williams was depressed for years but could make everyone laugh and hide it so well.<br />
<br />
Makes the Argus patch a little more obvious and to me Sargeras being in it seems less likely now but who knows! <br />
<br />
Also, I know people are associating it with Dr. Who and such... But basically this is exactly how the Dark Portals prior worked just visually in game was lacking, back then it couldn't show it through the graphics which set a standard and why it wasn't modernised.<br />
Not to mention... the whole planet in the sky thing has been around forever because you know... the Moon itself hangs around and shows it's existence for the past several thousands years!<br />
<br />
Less Likely? I think it's more likely that Sargeras will be there given what Kil'Jaeden says &quot;I never believe Sargeras could be stopped. Perhaps you will prove me wrong&quot;.</div></div><hr />

cinematic shows him on draenor, and his body you loot is on draenor, meaning just before he dies he teleports back to draenor, stopping you from perma killing him<br />
<br />

<br />
My thoughts on this are similar. We'll have to see if more information comes out. I actually hope KJ isnt considered dead for good, since he's, imo, a really big charecter that would have gone down pretty pathetically. Im still looking forward to the day we battle both KJ and Archimonde. Just my thoughts though.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, you can bet. I hope it will be unlocked for everyone at some point, imagine new player levelling and suddenly there is new planet on the sky.<br />

Oh and I'd like to see them justify the planet-sized portal out there. I mean... guys? The gravity? Can you into it? Do you know the consequences of an object of planetary propotions SUDDENLY appearing right next to the existing one? Given that that large portal allows physic objects and radiation of all sorts to pass through (which it does, cause we can actually SEE Argus through it) the gravity fields are immediately established between these two planets which will lead to the imminent Azeroth orbit shift. Which in turn will bring us quite a handful of obvious consequences. And I won't even bother mentioning the moon of Azeroth casually floating through that portal eventually.<br />

<br />
like kiljaden and elisande both chose to join sargeras/the legion because they could not see them as being able to fight back and had to join, it is a tough situation, yes he was a bad guy, but from what it seems, like elisande, he was forced, i am sad we had to kill elisande, during beta she lived and helped us<br />
<br />
Exactly! It adds a lot to the characters, I think. Good guys that ends up making hard choices, sometime out of despair. That makes them, as you say, the bad guys -- but they're not evil. That's what makes them such interesting villains. And Kil'Jaeden, saying to Velen that perhaps &quot;he could prove him wrong&quot; felt like perhaps, for a little moment, that he and Velen's relationship went back through time - right before Sargeras' made the pact with the Draenei. It packed quite a punch.<br />

This again. This argument for archimonde's fate got old real fast.<br />
<br />
In one of the dev interviews it was said that archimonde did indeed die in the twisting nether and so cannot come back. BUT, the dev did continue that &quot;we could change it in the future&quot;. <br />
<br />
So until the said &quot;change&quot; occurs, Archimonde is dead for good. Please stop being ignorant and bringing the cinematic up time and time again. They cannot design a cinematic based around mythic encounter because it wouldn't make sense to the LFR/Normal/Heroic crowd given the boss fight they encounter. Compromising on the cinematic from the mythic raider perspective is completely fine given how small that part of the raiding community is.<br />

A bit off-topic but I believe it was not a vision that Gul'dan saw but a memory. It's not the first time he's being abandoned. During his desperate state, he tried to touch elements but unable to do at the very second as we saw in Harbinger shorts. Now, before his final demise he again tried to touch to Sargeras' power, yet the history repeated itself. His eyes didn't reflect a vision but realization and memories.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so wahts the odds that we blow up argus in the end ?<br />
<br />
Remember that we have the guy who blew up the entire Nathreza on our side.<br />
<br />
<br />
I dunno, I think it's a bit crappy that Kil'Jaeden all of a sudden admits he wanted something else, for a guy that mercilessly hunted down his former race for over 10000 years, that's a bit of a lame turn. <br />
<br />
Before his fel corruption, they were like brothers. I believe as Archimonde willingly accepted Sargeras' &quot;gift&quot;, Kil'jaeden felt betrayed by Velen when he and the exiled ones left him alone with Sargeras knowing that he and the Eredar alone won't have a chance against the dark titan and the rest of the Burning Legion, and that's why he hunted the Draenei for thousands of years across the stars. For Kil'jaeden and the Eredar on Argus, they had no choice but joining the Legion, or be easily destroyed by Sargeras.</div></div><hr />

By the way, does this count as an actual death (i.e. he's killed in the twisting nether or whatever), or should we expect to see him again down the road revived? Assuming Sargeras just doesn't revive him for lol reasons anyways.<br />
<br />
So makes you wonder, who will be the final boss? I can't see it being Sargeras on Argus unless they're really going to push it as a space opera with void god battles, Archimonde again as a final boss similarly would be kinda lame considering he's been one before. Guess they could yank something out of their ass and make a new super strong eredar villain seeing how that is their home world.<br />
<br />
Didn't you see Argus? It's split open like an egg. The final boss--or one of them--will probably be a Dark Titan.</div></div><hr />

it was the sargerite keystone, a super powerful artifact, also it didnt happen instanrtly, you can see the space warping as it takes for fucking ever to happen<br />
also no we would not feel the change right away, and no the planet is still super far away, just it is now visable...<br />
<br />
<br />
just cause we can see the sun does that mean we should be burnt to a crisp by its fire? <br />
<br />
Well, gravitational waves do travel at the speed of light, so if you can see it, you get affected by the gravitational pull, but considering its not physically there, but only behind a portal, it should be fairly safe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The Exodar. I thought Velen told his people to get the Exodar fixed, they were going home? But that would take thousands of years. So it had to be some sort of portal, it's the devs favorite deus ex machina solution to everything. Illidan just pulled a Wrathion, but to a different planet. <br />
<br />
Interesting plot twist, but it feels unsatisfying after months of waiting for the next chapter in the story. Okay, so Argus is in the sky. Now what? We build a fleet of spaceships and invade? Is Sargeras there? The last I recall, nobody is sure really where he is. And it's now easier for the Legion to send more troops to Azeroth. <br />
<br />
Seems like this creates more questions than it answers. The payoff needs to be a lot bigger now. They've been building towards opening the tomb from day one in Legion, and now...the story really hasn't changed, other than KJ being dead. (They had to redeem him. They always have to redeem bad guys.)<br />
<br />
I'm less certain where they're headed now, after seeing the cinematic. Bold move, Cotton, lets see how it plays out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh and I'd like to see them justify the planet-sized portal out there. I mean... guys? The gravity? Can you into it? Do you know the consequences of an object of planetary propotions SUDDENLY appearing right next to the existing one? Given that that large portal allows physic objects and radiation of all sorts to pass through (which it does, cause we can actually SEE Argus through it) the gravity fields are immediately established between these two planets which will lead to the imminent Azeroth orbit shift. Which in turn will bring us quite a handful of obvious consequences. And I won't even bother mentioning the moon of Azeroth casually floating through that portal eventually.<br />
<br />
But - okay, Billzord Inc. were never too smart in terms of physics. I'm inclined to let this one slide. Magic and whatnot. Fine.<br />
<br />
Yes because you perfectly know how those Portals are working. Demons / Titans that can create rocks that opens a portal to wherever you want in the universe can perfectly set this portal not to convey gravitational waves.<br />
<br />
Maybe this portal is a giant OLED screen that shows you what is on the other side and when you touch it it teleports you there.<br />
<br />
You don't know, you're not a Burning Legion Engineer, as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Plus, in real life, Mages don't exist, neither do Blood Elves, nobody lives up to thousands of year, and when you die, well you die. If you're into that kind of real stuff, you should be playing GTA V instead of WoW, maybe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Sargeras has cocooned himself in Argus and is in a very weakened state.<br />
2. Somehow N'zoth will manage to jump outside of Azeroth through the new rift and land on Argus.<br />
3. N'zoth will infect Sargeras and turn him into a Dark Titan.<br />
4. Next expansion will be all about Void Lords etc.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Evangeliste</div><div class="date">2017-06-21, 08:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Less Likely? I think it's more likely that Sargeras will be there given what Kil'Jaeden says &quot;I never believe Sargeras could be stopped. Perhaps you will prove me wrong&quot;.Yeah but who said he was actually in Argus? It is a seat of power for Burning Legion but we were also led to believe for a long time the Pantheon were still wondering space but recently were confirmed to be actually dead, the cinematic doesn't exactly have Kil'jaeden saying &quot;Oh, he's in that, there&quot;. And the previous cinematic it wasn't confirmed he was speaking to Sargeras either it was simply again suggested and logically agreed upon.<br />
<br />
It's player theory that Argus is Sargeras based on Azeroth being a Titan and nascent, it's quite a logical approach once again but till we get there we have only assumptions. It's not been confirmed by any source by Blizzard yet. We don't know if they will pull a fast one where Sargeras isn't actually there - we just assume he is. I personally assume that Blizzard will be dirty tricksters from their track record, and he is less likely there. <br />
<br />
When you have Drak'Thul on Broken Shore saying &quot;Legion are not your enemy&quot;, makes you wonder what they have planned because Void lords are Sargeras's enemies as much as ours. Fire be purged - Sargeras is purging the void and corruption and wants life to be reset, Void Lords want Chaos. We as players are piggy in the middle.</div></div><hr />

You have the same misconception like many people on this forums..mixing up the fantasy and fable...the first one have rules (hell, sometimes even magic have scientific approach) usually those general rules, laws are the same like our real Earth (gravity, breeding, life support requirements (not specified, but usually oxygen, water, food) the races are bipedal humanoids most of the time (in western fantasy at least..in eastern...bit different) etc.) The fantasy world have it`s own background (May i suggest Raymond E. Feist Riftwar series? One of the best fantasy books ever...and ofc the rest of his bibliography:D Or David Gemmel and his Drenai Series? Another masterpiece especially the Waylander arc)<br />
In fables anything might happen without any logical explanation, no background for the &quot;world&quot;, no deeper connection with anything.....<br />

<br />
Retconning is all they do nowadays<br />
How is this in any way a retcon? It just explains that Kil'jaeden's motivation for initially siding with Sargeras was fear of the Legion, and that his anger towards Velen stemmed from jealousy of not just his gifts, but his will to defy Sargeras. Unlike Archimonde, who was just thirsty for power and had no particular grudge against Velen.<br />
<br />
And we already know that Sargeras started the Burning Crusade because he was trying to &quot;reboot&quot; the universe, for fear that the Void Lords would corrupt a nascent Titan and conquer reality completely. He would rather destroy everything, with the hope that the conditions to rebirth the universe should occur again someday, and that reality might be remade without the threat of their influence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, it's kind of shitty that an orc wasn't there to witness Kil'jaeden's fall, since Kil'jaeden was ultimately responsible for their corruption.<br />
<br />
Bolvar should have been present during the fight, so that Ner'zhul could speak through him and deliver some final insult to Kil'jaeden. Kil'jaeden realizing that he was defeated by Ner'zhul would have honestly been a more fitting end than Velen giving him peace. It's a nice moment for Velen, but Kil'jaeden didn't deserve any sympathy after everything he's done, regardless of his motivations.</div></div><hr />

Yeah my &quot;worry&quot; was that it would stay for a limited time like the blue dragonflight in SW after someone got the legendary staff or the sky in Dalaran after handing in the Algalon quest item.

Agreed! That would indeed have been really silly.<br />
<br />
But thankfully we can enjoy the sight of Argus for a while now and then we can start taking bets whether:<br />
<br />
1. It'll stay like that.<br />
2. It'll get blown up and be fragments of planet in our sky.<br />

Good guys that ends up making hard choices, sometime out of despair. That makes them, as you say, the bad guys -- but they're not evil. That's what makes them such interesting villains. And Kil'Jaeden, saying to Velen that perhaps &quot;he could prove him wrong&quot; felt like perhaps, for a little moment, that he and Velen's relationship went back through time - right before Sargeras' made the pact with the Draenei. It packed quite a punch.<br />
<br />

Yes because you perfectly know how those Portals are working. Demons / Titans that can create rocks that opens a portal to wherever you want in the universe can perfectly set this portal not to convey gravitational waves.<br />

Of course, laws of physics should be respected. But we're talking about a magical portal. Not a wormhole. Argus is not physically here.

if gravity goes through portals, wouldnt the size of the portal be irrelevant. if there were to be problems, those same problems would happen with a person sized portal and a planet sized portal. hell if gravity goes through portals wouldnt a portal from azeroth to azeroth fuck things up as well, suddenly two large masses are next to each other through a portal.</div></div><hr />

Oh please this is pure nonsense, Warcraft (long before World of Warcraft existed) was always tongue and cheek references to everything the creators think is cool, everything but the kitchen sink thrown in, no technical information about how anything works at all and a thin story to glue it together. This is no different. There has never even been an explanation in the games about where say magic in the universe of wow comes from or how beings learned to acquire it and use it, let alone how portals work or how any magical device works. Things just are and that's it. Even chronical hasn't covered any of this type of thing.<br />
<br />
Also no people, Archimonde and Kil'Jaedan are pretty fucking dead. At the very least for sure, no question about it, they are never going to pop up again as some kind of big bad. That tends to be the case with huge lore characters once they have been made into raid bosses, with few exceptions. Especially not with a cinematic video shown when you have killed them.</div></div><hr />

Only it doesn't. You see a fancy xplosion. You don't see an actual death of a character. Given that Billzord deemed themselves capable of casually reviving Illidan for lulz and moneys, what are the odds they won't do a typical &quot;I had a hearthstone&quot; excuse later on? I am most definitely not willing to bet against that one. Especially not with this tendency of Hollywoodisation. They stopped giving a damn about their own lore back in late 2010 with Cata and this mockery went from bad to worse ever since.</div></div><hr />

Oh ffs, stop it. He's dead. Get over it. <br />
<br />
You're grasping for straws here, the whole entire point of the scene is he's about to go down and take everyone with them.<br />
<br />
It's obvious from the dialogue alone.<br />
<br />
You don't get back up from that, there's no story worth telling where a villain character like this literally dies in a giant explosion but he's going to come back and it's like what you did before didn't even matter. It's finished it's done, the goose is cooked. Besides, it requires some kind of ritual to bring back these sort of powerful demons they don't just instantly get a new body or something.<br />
<br />
And frankly I'm not interested in debating you on the quality of wow's story, especially not if you somehow think it was at some point in the past &quot;way better&quot;, and especially especially not due to the fact that you don't even realize the only thing Ghostcrawler ever designed in wow was parts of the game interface and your posts indicate you're still raging about him.</div></div><hr />

Actually if Kil'jaedens final phase was in the Twisting Nether. He is dead. Period. Demons die permanently in the Nether. Like Elementals and their Plane. That's why Ragnaros and Al'Akir are dead.<br />
<br />
So again if that cinematic is confirmed to be taking place in the Twisting Nether. Kil'jaeden is gone.<br />
<br />
Archimonde was just confusing because of all that Alternate Universe rubbish. Although apparently didn't the devs say it was the same Archimonde or something and he's dead now as well because of the Mythic only phase?</div></div><hr />

They can easily turn this into an event that they have to solve, a questline to establish some kind of gravity field with the help of magic. Ignoring the physics (which ARE present in WoW, obviously) is the worst route. Doing something about it creates content, and satisfies people with at least a brief education.<br />

Escalation can be an easy trap to fall into in fiction(especially TV shows and video game sequels/expansions), but it doesn't always have to happen. Things don't HAVE to be a cosmic threat or even a bigger threat than the last guy. They just have to be a threat to your character(or the protagonist in other fiction). Your character could still be killed by a kobold or boar. Signs point to the Naga being the next big threat, and while they're not as big a threat as the Burning Legion... they don't have to be. They just have to be a threat.<br />
<br />
Supernatural is a good example of this. For years it was getting sillier and sillier trying to dream up the next big bad that they had to fight against all odds to avert the apocalypse for the eighth time. Then they put that on pause for a season and had them fight another group of Hunters that wanted to expand and push them out of America. The season with the British Men of Letters is the best season that show had for almost a decade, because it wasn't some overpowering cosmic threat that threatened all of creation that showed up as soon as they beat the last overpowering cosmic threat that threatened all of creation. It was just a bunch of guys trying to kill the protagonists.</div></div><hr />

I would be happy AF if that would be true. A decision to kill a certain character must not come easily, and any character's death should be permanent. However, as we all may possibly know by now, Billzord Inc. fails to comprehend this. Hence the Archimonde v2.0, Illidown v2.0, KJD v2.0 and inb4Lichking v2.0.<br />

Okay, so Argus is in the sky. Now what? We build a fleet of spaceships and invade? Is Sargeras there? The last I recall, nobody is sure really where he is. And it's now easier for the Legion to send more troops to Azeroth. <br />
<br />
<br />
In Chronicles it is stated that Sargeras would take millennia to reach Azeroth from across the Great Dark. He has been using the Well of Eternity, Avatars, Aegwyn, Medivh and other means to create portals into Azeroth as a way of expediting his arrival, since he wants to destroy the titan's world soul before it's born.<br />
<br />
Illidan ended up doing exactly what Gul'dan was trying to do at the Nighthold, a portal between Azeroth and Argus for Sargeras to go through. It seems Illidan wants to get on with it and take on Sargaras himself once and for all. It's like Azeroth has been hiding behind the fence with Sargaras banging it down, then we all of a sudden just open it for him and say COME AT ME BRO.</div></div><hr />

Given the previous cinematic showing his uneasiness with Sarg before -- I think he genuinely suspects Azeroth (and her heroes) stand a chance. Previously he'd thought they stood no chance but failure after failure may have shown him they really can stand. Unlike his counterpart -- he is actually smart and thought he was on the prevailing side.</div></div><hr />

i dont see a single soul talking about those things, BUT MUH GRAVITUUUUU!<br />
<br />
should i also mention that fire usually needs oxygen to burn, yet we see a lot fire and explosions happening on the demonic space goat generals space ship.<br />
or that we shouldnt be even able to move by all weight the we are carrying with us.<br />
<br />
like really, the only race that would be at least somehow be able to walk wearing this:<br />
are probably the tauren.<br />
