<br />
Yea. I gave up on mine after 7.1.5 went live and i figured that nothing much will change for Rets. Overall, they are solid spec with well built mechanics, its just that damn Crusade.<br />
Obvious design issue from the start, take a buff that is Retri built (and balanced) around for ages and give it an option to be uber powerful on top of which you add to mediocre Artifact Weapon a upgrade to its duration.<br />
<br />
Netherlight Crucible, new RNG grindfest, Tier 3 upgrades are RNG and always for our Bronze slots (4/4 traits) so theres a chance that you get an WotA upgrade too. <br />
<br />
I wonder.. How may classes will grind specific Relics and hoping that Netherlight Crucible T3 gives them upgrades for same specific traits?<br />
<br />
EDIT: Is that... a nerf to Prot Warriors Damage? O_o</div></div><hr />

<br />
Holy shit, I hope not. It's already going to take me a year to catch up to the current max.<br />
<br />
The Prestige system, while good on paper, is one of the worst grinds I've seen in the game. If the rewards are Legion-only, as I suspect they will be, it's the only grind in the game that gets worse as time goes on instead of easier or staying the same.<br />
<br />
A person starting a week after the expansion launched could get to and maintain max-Prestige without too much effort each day, but a person starting six months later has to make up that extra time in BGs and the like. There will come a point long before the expansion where a new player literally won't be able to get to max Prestige before the expansion is over, even if they are willing to put as much time in as someone who started in the first week of the expansion.<br />
<br />
I don't mind how long it'll take to hit max Prestige, but they either need to keep the rewards in after Legion and just keep adding new rewards indefinitely if they want to continue with it, or make some kind of catch-up mechanic if the rewards are intended to be available only during Legion.</div></div><hr />

Earlier prestige levels are already faster.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first is faster. The rest aren't. That knocks maybe two weeks off a year's commitment. The addition of another four levels, let alone more, far outpaces that. Unless you mean 7.3 made a few more early prestige levels faster.<br />
<br />
Even then, especially since I'm at Prestige 6 or so already, past that point, it doesn't help and I have a linear grind to go. Again, if the rewards are Legion-only, I can't catch up if they add many more levels, despite being willing to put in as much effort as people who started earlier.</div></div><hr />

Man if you still play Ret you really are a masochist.<br />
<br />
You're just gonna ignore everything else that got buffed significantly though? Keep in mind that right now 7 ranks of WotA is almost impossible to achieve with high relics unless you're blessed by the RNG gods to give you 2 Holy relics with that trait. Currently, I'm running only level 5 and that's 32.5 secs of Wings.<br />
<br />
With the new build letting you basically reforge relics and the possibility of pushing to 8 levels, getting to 35secs of uptime (instead of 40secs if the trait would have stayed the same) isn't really even a nerf. It's more a question of keeping it at reasonable uptime because Crusade really is damn broken. It's still (at max traits) going to be more than my current uptime by 2.5 secs. So no, playing Ret isn't masochism. The rest of the changes are really big to buff us across the board.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you guys seen it? If any of you play a shaman i ask that you see it if you can find the time, the new casting itself looks really cool with all the build up BUT the spell itself is much smaller than the one we have live currently...it also doesn't have the &quot;lava splash&quot; that falls on the ground after you cast it.<br />
<br />
Now, i know it might seen like such a small change for some ppl, but i do believe it takes away from the fantasy of the spell, they made so many upgrades to it throughout the years, it would be a real shame to take them away now.<br />
<br />
They could add the casting and build up and just leave everything else as it was imho...what do you think?</div></div><hr />

New lava burst animation at 2:23 watch?v=R7BvpCKpAqA<br />
<br />
The casting itself is pretty nice...but the projectile is smaller than the current one, it also doesn't have the &quot;lava splash&quot; effect...<br />
<br />
Pls help raise awareness to that fact, it isn't enough to shrink our dmg, they had to shrink our spells too &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
When we get a lava surge proc it gets even worse since we don't see the casting animation, the projectile is smaller and we get no &quot;lava splash&quot; =(</div></div><hr />
