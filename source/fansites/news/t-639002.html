[EU] Patch 3.1.0 PTR Testing - General Vezax<br />
General Vezax will be tested on European PTRs on Monday Night, March 16, starting at 19:00 CET. Streams and loot/abilities updates will be available as soon as the testing starts, for more info please check the news post of the latest PTR testing (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=42807.0). Check also the Ulduar Loot List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=43832.0). <br />

<br />
Changes to the encounter in this testing phase<br />
Health has been increased from 25M to 30M in 25-Man, from 6.3M to 7.7M in 10-Man. <br />
The add spawned during the fight now has 8M HP in 25-Man. (Up from 2M) <br />
Aura of Despair (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62692) now also reduces melee attack speed by 20%.<br />
Profound Darkness (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63420) now lasts 3 minutes instead of 1 minute.<br />
Corrupted Wisdom (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=64646) is now applied as an undispellable debuff after you judge once and seems to reduce the healing by roughly 75%, this will only affect you if you have the Judgement of the Wise (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=31878) talent. &quot;Your insight into Judgements of the Wise is corrupted by General Vezax's Aura of Despair, hindering your ability to heal.&quot;<br />
The energy field created by Shadow Crash (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63277) now lasts 20 seconds, up from 15.<br />
Searing Flames (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62661) now affects all enemies within 100 yards, up from 20. <br />
<br />
Abilities<br />
Health - 30M (25-Man) / 7.7M (10-Man)<br />
Shadow Crash (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63277) - Fires a shadow missile at a target, dealing 11310 to 12690 Shadow damage to all enemies near the impact point and knocking them away. After impact, leaves an energy field that lingers for 20 sec, increasing magical damage dealt by 50%, reducing healing done by 50%, and reducing mana costs by 30%. (10-Man (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=60833) - 5655-6345 damage)<br />
Searing Flames (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62661) - Deals 13875 to 16125 Fire damage to all enemies within 100 yards, superheating their armor and reducing its ability to protect them by 75% for 10 sec. (2 sec cast time, interruptable)<br />
Surge of Darkness (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62662) - Empowers the caster with dark might, increasing physical damage by 100% but reducing movement speed by 50%, for 10 sec. (Self buff on Vezax, you have to kite him around the room while the buff is up, lasts 10 seconds)<br />
Aura of Despair (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=62692) (Prevents mana regeneration from nearly all natural sources. Aspect of the Viper, Judgements of the Wise, Shamanistic Rage, and Spiritual Attunement remain at least partially effective. Also reduces melee attack speed by 20%.) is active throughout the whole fight, the only &quot;normal&quot; way to regain mana is to use potions. You can also destroy the crystals flying in the room, they will drop a green cloud on the ground and will restore your mana, they will also damage you for an equal amount of health points (1000 Mana regen = 1000 Damage), this buff stacks and will regen more and more mana (and deal more damage as well) over time. The hard mode version of the encounter require you to not use these clouds<br />
After Vezax spawns the 8th crystal, he will also spawn an add with 8M HP (25-Man) / 2.3M HP (10-Man). This add will repeatedly cast Profound Darkness (http://ptr.wowhead.com/?spell=63420) (Inflicts 500 damage to all enemies, and increases Shadow damage taken by 10% per application. Stacks up to 99.) and stack it on the raid, 20 debuffs means you will get 200% more damage from shadow spells (including Shadow Crash missiles from Vezax) <br />

Raids &amp; Dungeons - Hard Mode<br />
Ulduar has a ton of bosses. While I'm sure some players would love for us to deliver an instance with that level of content every month or so (and throw in a 5-player run to boot!), it's not in the cards, at least not for the next couple of years.<br />
<br />
Instead, what we tried to do with Ulduar is offer a lot of different ways to play the encounters. While the progress-oriented guilds may clear it quickly, we hope that some of the hard modes will offer them a lot to chew on. All of the players who are somewhere between barely being able to clear the instance and the &quot;world first&quot; crowd should be able to find a comfortable difficulty level as well. <br />
<br />
Your old model towards end game was a success, it brought you eleven million players. <br />
Most of whom never had a chance to finish a raid. They didn't get to see some of the best art in the game, hear the unique music or voice over, or in many cases even see the villian at the end of their quest line. From a production POV, instances are very expensive. It seems an odd choice to lavish all that attention on such a tiny percent of the player base.<br />
<br />
At the same time, we know there are players who love a challenge and are willing to do almost anything to beat a raid-destroying boss provided they also have a shot at the best loot. They don't want the instances to be over too soon. They like banging their head against the wall.<br />
<br />
And so hard modes were born. We tested the water a little with Obsidian Sanctum. We're going full bore with Ulduar. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15657790557-will-31-be-a-success.html))<br />

Raids &amp; Dungeon - Raid Composition<br />
As you well know, assuming you read the thread, this was a case of a class or spec wanting a unique buff to guarantee them a raid spot. It wasn't enough to bring *a* buff. They wanted a unique buff such that their guild would say, for example, &quot;We have to take a Retribution paladin or we'll be really behind.&quot;<br />
<br />
In BC, you &quot;had&quot; to have warlocks to bring Curse of Shadows (never mind that it mostly helped the warlocks) and you had to have a 2 or more Shadow Priests as a mana battery. The list of who you had to bring was so inflexible that doubling up (and in some cases even finding room for one player) was prohibitive. Ret is actually a great example. Their dps was fine, if they were in the right group and had all of the right buffs to prop up their damage. Problem was by the time you put those other 4 characters together, the Ret was the only person benefiting from those buffs and your dps would generally be higher with a rogue in that spot instead. Since the Ret dps in the caster group would be bad, there just wasn't much reason to bring the Ret at all. (Now there are exceptions and clearly Ret paladins did get to raid some of the time, but most Sunwell-level guilds know exactly what I am talking about.)<br />
<br />
Rather than just nerfing buffs to such a degree that you don't actually notice a power increase from being in a group, we spread all of the buffs around to multiple characters. Because there are no (or very few) unique buffs, you shouldn't have much problem finding someone to bring a necessary buff, even Replenishment, and honestly unless you are doing hard modes, you can probably do without a few of those buffs anyway. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/15668071380-gc-says-replenishment-nerf-inc.html))<br />
<br />
Healers - Spirit regeneration and healing in Ulduar<br />
That was partially because OFSR was so potent back then. Honestly, we're not trying to recreate the MC days or healer rotations, though I can understand if some of you are nostalgic for them.<br />
<br />
In Ulduar, you should run out of mana if...<br />
<br />
1) You don't have enough gear for the instance.<br />
2) You aren't playing the encounter well enough.<br />
<br />
If you have good enough gear and good enough skill and aren't standing in fires and are kiting adds correctly and doing all the right things, then you aren't designed to run OOM.<br />
<br />
The reason we wanted to nerf regen is that having infinite mana was allowing too much of a buffer on those two factors (it allowed for too much &quot;slop&quot; in organization and execution). Take Saphiron as an example. When mana regen is very high, the dps can sit in the blizzards for a little while because the healers can just heal through it and make up enough mana when they get a clearcasting proc or are running for ice blocks (because OFSR regen was so good). In previous tiers of content, the guild probably would have had to farm the earlier bosses for several weeks to get enough gear to have a chance at the final few.<br />
<br />
Now Naxx was designed to be easy, and Ulduar isn't going to be a lot harder. Hard modes on the bosses though are designed to be very hard. That means being inefficient with mana has to be a liability instead of a tool used to make the content less challenging.

Death Knights are too good<br />
Death Knights are too good in 3.0.9. We think they are in a better place in 3.1. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15671261989-no-you-are-wrong-about-death-knights.html))<br />
<br />
Tanking with different specs<br />
Our intent is not to force DKs down one tanking tree any more than they were before. It's cool that Frost tanking is getting more attention, but I think the jury is still out on whether one build is so much better than another one that players feel that they have no options. We'll give the community a chance to chew on all of the changes (more are coming, though mostly for dps DKs) and see if our opinion changes.<br />
<br />
Since Unholy slightly emphasizes avoidance, Frost slightly emphasizes armor and Blood slightly emphasizes health, it's also likely that some builds will be more useful on some encounters compared to others. That isn't necessarily what we're going for, but it's a likely outcome, and again as long as the delta isn't too huge, it should work out fine. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15673100740-are-dk-tanks-being-pidgeonholed.html))<br />
<br />
Scent of Blood<br />
Some DKs felt like they were runic power starved for Rune Strike and other abilities while tanking. Others said it was their avoidance that was the problem and still others have no problem maintaining threat at all.<br />
<br />
If you need runic power, Scent of Blood is for you. I wouldn't consider it nearly as mandatory as something like Anticipation for a tanking build. But we'll see what the community ends up doing.<br />
<br />
I have tanked in the game a lot, and I have found cookie cutter builds to be less mandatory than the forums and articles often suggest. Certain *talents* are mandatory, but you nearly always have a few extra points to get what you want, depending a great deal on your gear and the group you run with. If you have great healers and never die, then you probably don't need as much survivability. If you have amazing and impatient dps, then you might want to emphasize threat more. Again personal experience here, but I have also found many tanks to be more reluctant to swap out gear per encounter than they should. Good tanks often swap out their rings, trinkets etc. from fight to fight. Again, just throwing that out there since I know the DK class attracted some players to tanking that have never tanked before. Your mileage may vary.<br />
<br />
Regardless, the talent was pretty lackluster with its current numbers. We nerfed it back in beta when DKs had so much rp while leveling that they just spammed Death Coil. Enough has changed that that may no longer be a problem, and DK leveling is pretty easy regardless. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15673100401-scent-of-blood.html))<br />

Changes to Savage Defense in 3.1<br />
Actually, a big part of the change was because druids pointed out, correctly, that getting better gear wasn't as fun for them as other tanks because so few stats were relevant to their tanking, coupled with the fact that we don't itemize strict druid tanking gear. Getting more parity among tanking classes was a bonus in this case, because we probably could have done that in other ways.

Spirit on mage gear<br />
Mage gear has a lot of Spirit on it that doesn't help them much at the moment. We want to improve that. We are not going to turn mages into a class that stacks Spirit at the expense of all else, and we're not going to let Spirit provide &quot;free&quot; dps to mages that elevates them above the average dps of warlocks -- unless they are far below warlocks now, which does not seem to be the case. If you think it *is* the case, please provide some data or math so we know where you're coming from.

<br />
Glyph of Mirror Image in 3.1<br />
The Winter's Chill effect being applied to Mirror Image is supposed to be just a little extra bonus. I wouldn't at all depend on it to keep that crit bonus up. I don't know how you could. <br />
<br />
[...] The Mirror Image glyph is currently at 1% with a max stack of 5 per target but you get 3 mages and they spam a lot of Frostbolts, so probably you will get a 5% buff on top of the 5% you may already have as as mage.<br />
<br />
But with Mirror Image's cooldown, you're probably not going to have this buff up very often unless you really stack mages. It's not intended to be a new unique raid buff, just a little bonus to casting Mirror Image. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15659709642-10-scorch-buff-and-the-mirror-image-glyph.html))<br />
<br />
Improved Scorch nerf<br />
The buff was just too potent to be something that offered benefits to the entire group. We want you to be more powerful in a group, but we are trying to rein in buffs that are so powerful that you feel like you have to cancel your run if you don't have them.<br />
<br />
Even though we chilled out the magnitude of some of the buffs and debuffs, once groups started gearing up, things like dps and mana regen just went through the roof, largely because of these shared benefits. We'll make sure Fire dps is still where it needs to be even with this change. (Source (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/patchnotes/test-realm-patchnotes.html))<br />
<br />
You feel like a static 10 percent to crit is too much for the duration of the entire fight, but not if we get lucky and have our MI apply it for ~30 seconds if they manage to live?<br />
Well, sure. 10% all of the time &gt; 5% some of the time. I don't foresee groups stacking mages with the Mirror Image glyph so they can keep it up 100% of the time like some kind of Bloodlust rotation, but we;ll see.<br />
<br />
As I said in a related thread (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15673101076-lol--imp-scorch-too-powerful.html), it's possible the CoE debuff is too good as well. If you are choosing between player A and B for your tenth spot, we'd much rather you base that decision on who is the better player, not who brings the better buff.

Paladin Changes<br />
We think Protection needs Spiritual Attunement for obvious reasons, so we are making it a deep Prot talent.<br />
<br />
We don't actually like Holy and Ret having SA. It makes their mana regen depend too much on the encounter specifics. On fights like Patchwerk, they have no mana from SA. On dragon fights, they have a ton. That makes it hard to tune on our end because they are either starved in the first case or drowning in the second case.<br />
<br />
We want to tune Holy through Illumination and Ret through Judgements of the Wise and let Prot use SA. All 3 can Divine Plea, but Prot can do it more often. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/15661689639-spiritual-attunement-removed-on-ptr.html))<br />
<br />
Spiritual Attunement<br />
Spiritual Attunement is a great mechanic for a tanking paladin who needs the mana and gets it from taking damage. For other paladins it just complicates balance. On Patchwerk you get no mana from it as Holy / Ret and on Sartharion it gives you just a ton of mana. So you're either bone dry on one fight or drowning in mana on another, totally depending on raid damage.<br />
<br />
The best knob we have for tweaking Ret mana return is to up Judgements of the Wise from 15% to 20% or whatever it needs to be. (Holy has Illumination.) <br />
<br />
GC... you do realize that everyone in the paladin community is taking this as a promise you will buff jotw, right?<br />
Such is my lot in life. We need to get some numbers for Ret mana after all of these changes and make a call at that time. I was just pointing out that we have plenty of knobs to tweak to balance the class without SA.<br />
<br />
Remember, the goal here is not to nerf Ret mana. It is to make it more stable instead of varying wildly depending on the encounter. While encounters will always be different to some extent, when you look at the mana provided by SA on different fights, it can be pretty extreme. Ulduar balance is going to be tricky because we want the normal encounters to still be accesible to most raiders while the hard modes need to be balanced on a knife's edge. Having so much variation is just going to get in the way of that.<br />
<br />
The Seal of Blood glyph will most likely have to be changed to accomodate this change. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14132379462-ret-paladins-and-spiritual-attunement.html))<br />

Rogues in PvP<br />
We think it is closest to point 4. We like where rogues are in PvP in terms of damage and utility, but other classes are doing too well. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15671261973-rogues-fallen-so-far-so-fast.html))<br />

Doomguard changes and Affliction DPS balancing<br />
If you mean do we forget that players have the Doomguard out on some fights, no we don't do that. We don't say &quot;Yep looks like warlock dps is perfect&quot; only to have someone else say &quot;Dude, he had the DG out then!&quot;<br />
<br />
This may seem obvious, but it must not be because after we announce a nerf, you'll always see a slew of posts that crop up. &quot;Dude, did you forget we do bonus damage against cats?&quot; (Now, there are bugs sometimes that artificially inflate dps numbers. Deep Wounds and poisons are two recent examples.)<br />
<br />
We do balance classes around the fact that they sometimes have abilities on a long cooldown. They are still abilities and you do use them. If it's a 10% dps increase that is up 10% of the time, then gratz, you have a 1% dps increase from that ability.<br />
<br />
Similarly, we don't just balance around one type of fight with one type of gear and one set of raid buffs. There isn't just a magic number that everyone is supposed to hit. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/15660811611-doomguard--a-simple-answer-plz.html))<br />
<br />
Curse of Elements too powerful?<br />
It could be that the CoE debuff is too powerful too. Crit however tends to have synergistic effects moreso than just +damage because it keys into a lot of class abilities that proc from crits.<br />
<br />
If anything, we might have to chill out the &quot;I need more utility&quot; stuff even more. As long as players are expecting raid slots because of their amazing utility then utility is probably still too amazing. You should get raid slots because you know what the blank you are doing, not because your buff is the awesome.

Unrelenting Assault in 3.1 and Shattering Throw<br />
This was basically where we were coming from. It sounds powerful, until you compare it to Pummel which stops all casting from that school and is off the GCD. Priests and druids have some instant heals which can work around the threat of the Overpower. Getting the bleeds off can also help.<br />
<br />
As with Shattering Throw, this is a new mechanic and we're going to have to monitor it closely to see how things develop. If the duration is too long or internal cooldown too short, that's the kind of thing we can adjust in a hotfix. Similarly, we can always buff as needed.

<br />
So what that most of them never finished a raid? They still had a huge world to explore, tons of dungeons and quests, not to mention pvp. Maybe most people never finished a raid because they just wanted to play solo or in smaller groups, rather than joining a big, organized raiding guild and playing on schedule? Obviously they enjoyed the game as it was since they kept playing.<br />
<br />
<br />
At the same time, we know there are players who love a challenge and are willing to do almost anything to beat a raid-destroying boss provided they also have a shot at the best loot. They don't want the instances to be over too soon. They like banging their head against the wall.<br />
<br />
And so hard modes were born. We tested the water a little with Obsidian Sanctum. We're going full bore with Ulduar.<br />
<br />
So they didn't learn from the failure of hard modes in WotLK? You don't get the same sense of achievement from it than you got from downing hard bosses previously. They tried it and it failed, just admit it and try something else. If they continue with achievements-as-content &quot;full bore&quot; is probably a good characterization of Ulduar.<br />
<br />
<br />
As you well know, assuming you read the thread, this was a case of a class or spec wanting a unique buff to guarantee them a raid spot. It wasn't enough to bring *a* buff.

The list of who you had to bring was so inflexible that doubling up (and in some cases even finding room for one player) was prohibitive.<br />
<br />
Building a working raid composition was a puzzle, but there were multiple ways to do it. Bosses in Sunwell were downed with multiple different compositions. What they're doing is dumbing down the game, they should just admit it upfront.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ret is actually a great example. Their dps was fine, if they were in the right group and had all of the right buffs to prop up their damage. Problem was by the time you put those other 4 characters together, the Ret was the only person benefiting from those buffs and your dps would generally be higher with a rogue in that spot instead. Since the Ret dps in the caster group would be bad, there just wasn't much reason to bring the Ret at all. (Now there are exceptions and clearly Ret paladins did get to raid some of the time, but most Sunwell-level guilds know exactly what I am talking about.)<br />
<br />
I was in a Sunwell-level guild and I know exactly the opposite was true. There was always a spot for a retri in our melee group since one was part of an optimal grouping. The problem was finding a competent retri to fill that spot. We tried a bunch of them, putting them in the optimal group, yet they failed miserably.

<br />
<br />
Except that it's a raid almost nobody ever got a chance to enjoy. Blizzard said this was a mistake, and they were right. They have corrected that mistake.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So what that most of them never finished a raid? They still had a huge world to explore, tons of dungeons and quests, not to mention pvp. Maybe most people never finished a raid because they just wanted to play solo or in smaller groups, rather than joining a big, organized raiding guild and playing on schedule? Obviously they enjoyed the game as it was since they kept playing.<br />
<br />
This is so horrifically untrue. There are people (myself included, all too often) that would love nothing more than a chance to raid weekly, with players that don't dick around... except that we can't create a big ridiculous schedule in the middle of the night, multiple nights a week, every week. I do not want to solo. I have soloed for 80 levels and countless hours or gold grinding, doing quests all over, and have done ENOUGH instances. I want to raid. I do not have the time available to me to sit back and not be invited to the very best content of the game because I 'have not raided with the guild for the past 15 weeks straight' or because 'my spec does not fit their optimal group DPS spreadsheet.'<br />
Thank God Blizz has made raids somewhat more accessable. The narrow-minded view that hard-mode kills that few people can honestly do /=/ equal accomplishment (despite the fact that you do in fact get epic rewards, higher ilevel items, MORE items per kill, and ultimately, a mount/title almost nobody will have) NEEDS to change.<br />

<br />
The difference there is, it's their job to be the shiz at soccer. WoW isn't my job. I will not 'train' multiple days per week on WoW, every week, because it is a game, something to do in my free time. I work two jobs, and have four college classes, to boot. It's a great night when I can kick back and enjoy the game I'm paying every month for. I pay the same as everybody else - I should have a chance to at the very least see the content, if I'm good enough.<br />
By this, I mean that my skill should be enough to allow me to go with my guild, or even a different guild as a filler, when I can go, and have a chance to experience the content, clear it without the 'hard' modes (unless we're feeling cocky.), and call it a day. Those with the available time investment have the opportunity to get a great deal more loot, gear up significantly faster than everybody else, and can grind themselves away at doing hard modes, or better yet, getting everybody to live through Algalon. Have fun; I don't hate ya for it. I'll most likely never get to kill Algalon, and I'll just have to live with myself knowing that. Somehow, I think I'll manage to sleep at night.<br />
<br />
What I hate is the 2-4% of the WoW population demanding that the most enjoyable, awesome, and amazing content be exclusively available to them, because they have the 'dedication' to spend hours upon hours at a time on WoW. Their dedication does not reduce the significance of their ability to outperform everybody else in WoW, but it's morally incomprehensible for them to demand exclusive access to the bulk of the game's content.<br />
<br />
Is Naxx too easy? Yeah, probably. But at least I got to see it. Is Ulduar without hard modes still gonna be too easy for a lot of the more hardcore guilds? Yeah, probably. But that's why they're so damn good. Blizz has to draw an imaginary balancing line that makes the raids possible for people who can't invest weeks wiping on one boss over and over again, while still somehow making them satisfying to those that would love nothing more than to end a night with a final victory and a 600G repair bill. If satisfying both of those groups sounds impossible, that's probably because it is.<br />
<br />
Ulduar balance is going to be tricky because we want the normal encounters to still be accesible to most raiders while the hard modes need to be balanced on a knife's edge. Having so much variation is just going to get in the way of that.</div></div><hr />

The game should contine to be maintained in such a way where every competent player can enjoy the content, without having to submit to a schedule. Everyone cannot get into the great raiding guilds and there arent enough people to sit arround and research strategies all day just to complete them. Blizzard has created a method for everyone who pays their money to them to enjoy. If you dont like it then stop playing and find another game to show off your &quot;no RL skills&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Your point would be valid if you are talking about World Cup Soccer on the playstation or X-box. I imagine quite a few professional Soccer players would feel insulted to have a WOW raid instance being compared to the ultimate tourney in their sport as an equal achievement. <br />
<br />
Also you can make quite a good living as a professional soccer player if you are good enough, just ask Beckham. Do point me toward the professional WOW player getting paid millions to join a raid guild.</div></div><hr />

Raids &amp; Dungeons - Hard Mode<br />
Ulduar has a ton of bosses. While I'm sure some players would love for us to deliver an instance with that level of content every month or so (and throw in a 5-player run to boot!), it's not in the cards, at least not for the next couple of years.<br />
<br />
Instead, what we tried to do with Ulduar is offer a lot of different ways to play the encounters. While the progress-oriented guilds may clear it quickly, we hope that some of the hard modes will offer them a lot to chew on. All of the players who are somewhere between barely being able to clear the instance and the &quot;world first&quot; crowd should be able to find a comfortable difficulty level as well.<br />
<br />
Your old model towards end game was a success, it brought you eleven million players.<br />
Most of whom never had a chance to finish a raid. They didn't get to see some of the best art in the game, hear the unique music or voice over, or in many cases even see the villian at the end of their quest line. From a production POV, instances are very expensive. It seems an odd choice to lavish all that attention on such a tiny percent of the player base.<br />
<br />
At the same time, we know there are players who love a challenge and are willing to do almost anything to beat a raid-destroying boss provided they also have a shot at the best loot. They don't want the instances to be over too soon. They like banging their head against the wall.<br />
<br />
And so hard modes were born. We tested the water a little with Obsidian Sanctum. We're going full bore with Ulduar.<br />
<br />
<br />
And there we have it folks, the end and death of Wow.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have it so wrong.<br />
<br />
They had an awesome model, when raids were first released they were imba hard and many people couldn't even clear trash. This brought such an epic and legendary feeling to loot that many people were intrieged and drove them harder to play better.<br />
<br />
When the first 10-50 guilds managed to complete the instance Blizzard would generally stealth nerf them and more guilds would trickle through to see end game content.<br />
<br />
More stealth nerfs would happen, until eventually pugs could farm them. As the level cap is raised with expansions, the last of the people would get to see content.<br />
<br />
Now blizzard has made everything wide open and accessable to everybody.<br />
Nothing is sacred, nothing is epic, nothing is legendary.<br />
<br />
They have shot themselves right in the foot.<br />
<br />
All making content easy to do is accelerate the process of which the game is dieing. People willl complete Ulduar and not bother playing again.<br />
<br />
What a load of croc this is.<br />
<br />
Give back sunwell difficulty and nerf the instance when the first few guilds start to complete it. Its miles better than this bullcrap &quot;lets pretend to make content last longer by giving it hard modes&quot; structure.</div></div><hr />

I say kudos to people who can do the hard modes, because they are hard. 3 Drake Sartharion may not be hard to people who have been doing it over and over (I remember this same argument back on old school Naxx, my server had the first atiesh as well as 3 guilds at the end actually farming the place. They had a druid in full T3 running around - I mean full T3, ring everything.) but 10 man maly has only been downed by 46 percent of the populus and 25 man maly has only been downed by 30 percent, if those numbers are anything indicative you'll seen even less who have seen 3 Drake Sartharion down.<br />

But it is just rumors. Until the 'Prince' officially speaks up I will discount those as internet rumors meant to enchance their 'prestige' among their fanboys. Even if true they are likely still far from the NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL, or Major Soccer leagues in pay scale. And still not a valid career option for most people to devote hours of training and pratice in hopes of landing a paying job later on.<br />

Clearly you are to narrow minded to understand it was a metafor. However, I will not try to change ur opinion nor do I care todo so. You are ofcourse entitled to it and I will not call you a &quot;moron&quot; for that reason. I am a little more mature than that.<br />
<br />
Now to my point. I do understand, and agree, with the &quot;normal&quot; mode and &quot;hard mode&quot; structure. That is totaly fine with me. However, the hard mode should REEEEAALLY be hard mode, like muru pre nerf. It is not! Blizzard have stated that they will never make another &quot;sunwell&quot; again. If they are going all out on hard modes Blizzard, why not make it REAAAALY hard?

There is a difference between REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEALLLLY hard and impossible.<br />
Sunwell wasn't cleared in a week because it was IMPOSSIBLE to do so. (gate system)<br />
<br />
Sartharion is easy. Sartharion 2drakes is hard. Sartharion 3drakes 10-man is REEEEEEEALLY hard.<br />

I have a feeling people are comparing WoW to other MMORPG's out there for some reason.. <br />
<br />
with every WoW expansion content level is reset back to leveling -&gt; &quot;entry level&quot; -&gt; &quot;raid&quot; -&gt; &quot;mid-raid&quot; -&gt; &quot;end game&quot;<br />
<br />
other MMO's expansions are just more end game content... their expansions = wow's content patches.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I get that feeling too, about the over-comparison of WoW to other MMOs. If you want a brutally hard MMO, play FFXI, for example. Or Everquest. Or any other number of brutal MMOs out there, Ragnarok is another. When you die, you lose experience. In some games, your epic equipment can break when you die. FOREVER. In Everquest, the enemies scale in power at LEAST twice as fast as your character - by the time you are level 20, if you aren't leveling with a partner, or two, then you will die, constantly. Raid bosses destroy guilds, rip them apart because nobody can touch them, and it often has little to do with strategy, and a lot more to do with luck and overpowered melee attacks, or special attacks.<br />
<br />
If that's somebody's definition of fun... then maybe they should go play those other 'fun' games. WoW has millions upon millions of subscribers, if it were all that hard, I doubt it would be so successful.</div></div><hr />

I do think that needing more people makes it harder, and requiring each of those 25 people to be skilled is important to raising the difficulty (rather than it was in the 40 man).<br />
<br />
I also think there is a misconception of what casual is/should be. Right now the time complete a boss/raid isn't/shouldn't be considered an issue (very minimal time commitment needed), however most raiding guilds raid 4-5 day a week which probably isn't considered casual. What I don't think casual should be is &quot;I pay to play so give me epic loot&quot;; Time commitment/skill should be reflected in the gear received/earned. Casual players should still have to have a certain skill level to earn loot. What some 'hardcore' players are saying (maybe poorly) is that Blizzard went from catering to them primarily to handing out 'free' loot to the 'noob' masses, while not providing them the same challenge. The hard-mode has yet to be a real challenge, and 30-40% is still quite high considering the 'old days'. This Hardcore group may just be griping/QQing, but there is a lack of challenging end-game content that in the past was always there.<br />
<br />
Yes, casual players should have a system to earn good loot, but don't you think time-commitment/skill should still play a role? Just because people are casual do they not want the challenge of a higher difficulty raid? I would like to see the difficulty of Sunwell (or something a bit less) for the casual player; having the ability to not reset instances based on Blizzard schedule would help. Doing the same instance, having the same skill, getting the same loot, but over a time schedule that is possible for me/my causal Guild to do. Why isn't this an option? Why is causal associated with easy? That isn't casual that is just lazy. I think Blizzard is guilty of equating casual with easy and in-turn has catered this game to the lazy.<br />
<br />
My little Rant:<br />
<br />
From some of the post up here I find that you like the level of difficulty of Naxx the way it is. However, there is little else out there to challenge those who want one. Blizzard has stated that Uld will not be much harder, besides the hard-mode; and this may still not add enough to end-game. <br />
<br />
I don't care if you identify as Hardcore or Casual, this game like any game should be challenging, that is what makes a game fun - the challenge of achieving a goal/receiving a reward. Getting the same reward without the challenge seems empty to me. I like learning the fights and taking time to progress. That is what is fun, and much funner than the eventual farming needed to get the rewards (gear). If I am not around for the learning process going into a farmed run is nowhere near as rewarding to me. I want there to be a good balance between content for Casual and Hardcore, yet with Blizzard it always seems to be one or the other.</div></div><hr />

It needs to be restated that there's a pretty obvious reason for this problem that you put forth. Blizz has their progression model, if not for the sake of simplicity, then for the sake of the sanity of the developers. They cannot insert both UBER EPIC HARD WITH HYPER LOOTZ in the exact same patch as early-progression-entry-level-raid. It doesn't make sense. Naxx is the entry-level-raid in WotLK. Ulduar is the next step. 3.2 is the next, Icecrown is the last. Blizz has attempted to placate the 'hardcore' with hard modes, because they can't actually insert hyper-difficulty raids yet, because of the progression model.<br />
<br />
Is it possible there is a better model than this progression? Other than releasing everything all at the same time, which just isn't feasible, I can't think of one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't Blizz will be able to satisfy everyone or even close to a majority of the customers concerning raid difficulty. Some people are going to be disappointed regardless of what they do. <br />
<br />
The fact the Raid instances are expensive to design will likely always keep them user friendly cause the bigshots that control the company will never like spending a lot of money on things that very few of their customers will ever bother with. They are more concerned with greater profits and not with a few feeling more 'prestige' than others. Call them greedy if you like but that's the nature of the corporate world. Without those bishots to provide funding you never would have had this game to start with.</div></div><hr />

The fact that you can, in all seriousness, even begin to equate those two activities is laughable. It's an MMPORG for god's sake, with an emphasis on G for GAME, and no S for sport. A closer analogy would be to say that if you arent willing to train multiple days a week, every week for it, you arent allowed to kick towards the goal, just pass the ball around. Why is Blizzard or the large base of players supposed to care if you can't fill your self-esteem quota from.... entertainment? Do you even see the personality flaw that implies?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This. I have basically quit because of Blizzards new &quot;Everybody gets free epics&quot; model Every guild did not have Kara down in two weeks, every guild did not get Gruul down in 3 weeks every guild didn't have Magtheridon down in 4 weeks, Every guild did not clear SSC/TK before Hyjal/BT Everyone did not clear Sunwell before Wrath, but their last system with TBC was quite well done.<br />
<br />
By steadily nerfing the content down hardcore players got the prestige of clearing these instances first and having access to things noone else had, but other players still got to see the content a few patches down the road. <br />
My guild progressed at the exact line Blizz expected casuals to progress. <br />
&gt;We took a few months and steadily worked our way through Karazhan and Gruul we did not kill Magtheridon.<br />
&gt;They removed the attunement for SSC/TK my guild started in and started killing bosses in there we went back and killed Magtheridon. <br />
&gt;They removed the attunement for Hyjal/BT my guild moved in and starting killing more bosses and after gearing for a bit went back and finished off Kael/Vashj <br />
&gt;We managed to kill Illidan a few weeks after sunwell came out. <br />
&gt;We managed to clear three bosses into sunwell when 3.0 came out. <br />
All told my guild which raids 5 nights a week Sunday-Thursday for 3 hours a night - no obligation to raid every night, fairly casual. Managed to see almost every bit of content in TBC. To me that was enough. I was never in that first line of players who cleared the game and had to wait on the next content patch for more, there was always that holy ground that was still ahead of me. <br />
<br />
Now My guild cleared Wrath in 3 weeks excluding hard modes*. I quit the game after 2 weeks of farming. I have beaten the game I'm done with it. I don't need a 100% complete all scenes unlocked etc etc, I was only addicted to this game because I couldn't win. And this is the wall I personally believe a lot of players have hit.<br />
<br />
*Which btw I don't care in the least about achievements they are just an annoyance, I don't need an ingame system that breaks the immersiveness level of this game to tell me that I have reached a predetermined achievement and thus have earned xx points which really don't affect anything. Eff that S#@t. If I earn an achievement it will be based on my own rating system of what an achievement is not what some crap system tells me. For instance, sneaking into Ironforge on my rogue and ganking 5 max level players before eventually getting caught by players while vanish was down. I knew that was an achievement for me I don't need or want anything to go BleepBloop you got 10 points for doing this. To me that just devalues the experience I had.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have been playing since early vanilla (not quite the start, about 1.3 or so), I have been playing casually for the majority of this, however I did get an opportunity to play with a raiding schedule for about 6 months through TBC with a raiding guild certainly not the best guild but they got some stuff done. The content I have seen is limited and I am hoping to eventually see End game content on at least one level cap. In vanilla the best I saw was MC, Onyxia and first boss of BWL, TBC I saw Gruuls, Mag, and a couple of SSC, Now in WotLK I have seen Archavon... Yes I know not even a 'real raid'.<br />
<br />
I am a good player and have been playing a long time with multiple lvl capped characters, my biggest issue is timezone, I am in Western Australia and am on an US server, I have tried on an oceanic server but the result was basically the same I play too Early for the US servers (start at approx. 4:00am server) but Too Late for Oceanics (start at approx. 11pm server), however I do on weekends get to be on late enough to coincide with some US players, but that's only if I can keep my eyes open that long. I asually play for 4 hour a night longer on weekends. I am reluctant to change to a european server as I pay for 3 US accounts and have all of the expansions for each.<br />
<br />
These issues are what some players have as obstacles and having the content have 10 and 25 man modes will hopefully help me &amp; others progress. I have since tried improving my PvP game to allow me to continue gaining skill and some relatively decent gear, but again I have another issue, arena. At the times I play there are very few other teams available for arena battles.<br />
<br />
I do believe that having the Hard modes available to the 'Hardcore' players should placate them somewhat, I also believe however that they can generate their own hard modes (eg. rogue tanking Illidan or 4 manning onyxia(when it was possible)).<br />
<br />
I don't really see how Blizzard can make things any more challenging without catering for the 'under resourced' as I like to call the capable/competent/skilled casual players or expending a huge amount of resources better employed in other gameplay areas.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but no. Blizzard expected you to complete those attunements. They started removing them once they realised casuals weren't just taking longer to get through content, they weren't getting through content.</div></div><hr />

I enjoy the game as is without the endgame content but I would certainly like to be involved in it.<br />

I also stated that the hardmodes should placate them somewhat not be the absolute solution to the problem. However I do understand the dilema of having such a good group that anything you face is easy mode.<br />

The whole point of the new system is that all types of players can enjoy the game. The fact that you say his opinion doesn't count for as much because he's less experienced shows that you don't get it. His opinion counts for the exact same amount of attention as yours does simply because you both pay for and play the game.</div></div><hr />

in vanilla the skins for weapons and armor were epic looking<br />
bc they got lazy and made pvp and raid look the same except for colors<br />
in wotlk they took the skins of old tier pieces and put them in<br />
<br />
as far as raid content naxx was fun...for a week<br />
and uldar not being much harder is not aot to look forward to<br />
<br />
when this game came out it was well done now that blizz has there players there is no need to keep up to the same level<br />
<br />
raids should be hard <br />
and they should take months to complete<br />
ppl want to log in and go to naxx to get there lootz and do no work for it<br />
<br />
and for this<br />
<br />
To be fair, we nerfed tanking and dps a lot in this patch too. Still, if the idiots stand in the fire, guild kick them. If you don’t have that power, then find a better guild. “Blaming the healer” is to some extent a social problem. There are plenty of healers who thought Naxx was way too easy and are eager for more of a challenge. They will find it in Ulduar, at least in the hard modes<br />

it is just ashame that blizz is saying uld is gonna be a joke as naxx was</div></div><hr />

<br />
renraiku - I understand your point, and I think that because of your odd circumstance you cannot experience the game fully. However, I think the point Vatigu is making is that if you were raiding with a guild 4+ hours daily you would see just how easy this game has become and how it requires no skill anymore, compared to when it did prior to WotLK.<br />
<br />
Fishdoom - the 'new' system isn't working. Everyone has the same epics, they are very easy to get, and so it now is only about time commitment rather than time+skill commitment (and the time commitment is very low). In the past it took a lot of time to progress through a raid, and the gear felt earned. If you can PuG it, then it is not epic. I think that unlocking/nerfing certain raids after most of the 'hardcore' players have past it is a fine way of allowing more casual players to access it. Having regen = infinite mana, is something that would make sense in an unofficial server, but to happen on a Live server is just lazy. Same for ridiculous DPS. I actually think Blizzard realizes it dropped the ball and now will have to slowly correct it (in order not to lose the mass 'ez-mode' loving community it has accumulated).<br />
<br />
Pryer - has hit it right on (along with Vatigu's first post) ^^. It should be about progression over time, not &quot;hand me my epic lootz please.&quot; All we can hope for is that the changes in 3.1 to Healing/DPS plus the little step up in difficulty for Uld will return balance and make things a little more like vanilla/TBC.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fantomspower</div><div class="date">2009-03-17, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It needs to be restated that there's a pretty obvious reason for this problem that you put forth.

<br />
Is it possible there is a better model than this progression? Other than releasing everything all at the same time, which just isn't feasible, I can't think of one.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, but my point is that in the past there was the same natural progression (the one you speak of) without the waiting period of patches (see Vatigu quoted below). Also, Blizzard even stated that the difference between Naxx and Uld is only a minimal step up in difficulty (so most will complete it quite easily/quickly). I don't know about you, but if I had to choose better/more content over the DK class, I'd choose content - and yes DK is taking up a lot of their efforts to balance.<br />
<br />
There have always been the 'uber-hard' raids to occupy the Hardcore group, balanced by lesser and many raids to occupy the Casual. However, what they are doing now is not casual; casual shouldn't mean easy, it means plays less. A base-skill level should still be required. So, for causal they should either require the same amount of time to get the best loot, but can be done over a longer period (instead of weekly), or get lesser, but still good loot, for the less time. This is assuming they still have some modest amount of skill. It takes very minimal effort to do some research to find ways to maximize your classes potential (the information is all out there, the hardcore players are not shy about helping out other players play better). <br />
<br />
Rant Time #1:<br />
<br />
Again, it goes back to being lazy and expecting something just because you pay per-month for it. No one is forcing you to play or pay or even buy the initial game in the first place. MMO's are time-sinks, WoW is an MMO, it doesn't matter if it is the most popular, it still is an MMO and should cater to the MMO crowd. Time = reward, assuming that time also = more skill (not always the case). Entry-raids are fine and needed, but if the gear in Naxx is entry and attainable by nearly anyone, yet at the same time is also the best gear available then it is not really 'entry' level gear, is it? <br />
<br />
There should always be a noticeable level higher for those willing to get it, even if that means spending more time. So, you can say they have no RL, but it is their choice to play WoW over other things. If you choose to do other things besides WoW then that is your choice, and I am sorry, but you shouldn't have access to the same gear if you are not willing or wanting to put in the effort/time. As I said I am all for equality, but people who just expect handouts shouldn't be catered to and that is what is happening in WotLK.<br />
<br />
&quot;Time is money, friend.&quot; Equally, &quot;Time is gear, friend.&quot; So if you have the time to work it out with the top raiding guilds 4, 5, 6 days a week then you have earned it. Trust me, you won't last long without skill running in those circles. Otherwise, sit back get what you can, enjoy your RL and stop complaining.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I am a good player and have been playing a long time with multiple lvl capped characters, my biggest issue is timezone, I am in Western Australia and am on an US server.<br />
<br />
<br />
I feel your pain, and I've seen your situation before, and even with Oceanic time zone, it doesn't help. So, I get your point, but I think if you found a server that would fit into you time schedule then you would would fit perfectly into the semi-hardcore or even hardcore category (playing 4+ hours daily) and probably be farming much of, or the lack of end-game content in WotLK. Vatigu, as casual/semi-hardcore player sees the changes from TBC, which had content for both Casual and Hardcore, to WotLK which is just set to easy-mode providing little additional challenge. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This. I have basically quit because of Blizzards new &quot;Everybody gets free epics&quot; model Every guild did not have Kara down in two weeks, every guild did not get Gruul down in 3 weeks every guild didn't have Magtheridon down in 4 weeks, Every guild did not clear SSC/TK before Hyjal/BT Everyone did not clear Sunwell before Wrath, but their last system with TBC was quite well done.<br />
<br />
By steadily nerfing the content down hardcore players got the prestige of clearing these instances first and having access to things noone else had, but other players still got to see the content a few patches down the road. <br />
<br />
My guild progressed at the exact line Blizz expected casuals to progress... <br />
<br />
...I don't care in the least about achievements they are just an annoyance... For instance, sneaking into Ironforge on my rogue and ganking 5 max level players before eventually getting caught by players while vanish was down. I knew that was an achievement for me I don't need or want anything to go BleepBloop you got 10 points for doing this. To me that just devalues the experience I had.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thank you. You seem to get exactly what I mean. It isn't about Hardcore vs. Casual, it is about the challenge this game used to have vs. the lack-of challenge it has now, and by the handing out of so-called epic loot to anyone. Ok, maybe 3.1 is addressing some of this, trying to maybe add some skill back into the game (more mindfulness needed for Healers, as now regen basically = infinite mana)... I can feel a rant coming, so without further introduction...<br />
<br />
Rant Time #2:<br />
<br />
However, homogenizing DPS by allowing hybrid-classes to do as much dps as other pure-dps classes is wrong. Certain classes should be able to out dps others - there should be a balance between buffs/raid-utility vs. overall-dps, why has this suddenly changed? Why was the game made to allow 50%+ spell crit? Who a Blizzard thought this would make the game better? What happened to proper scaling? I am just confused about what has happened to PvE, and maybe the community has changed, I don't know. I am just wondering where is the uber-leet raid instances that only the select few could do. I miss knowing that they are out there, waiting. <br />
<br />
Yes, the fact that Blizzard jumped on the Achievement band-wagon is quite lame. I felt just as much reward beating MC/BWL back in the day without the game telling me how good I am. The reward system should be ingrained into the gameplay like most games, and this whole Achievement concept is a step back towards the 'easification' aimed to the masses, thank you Xbox360. Anyways this is besides the point. <br />
<br />
Really though, what is the deal with DK? Why are they even a class? Looking on warcraftrealms.com DK are about 17%, yes they are new and fancy and many of them may just be 55, but you don't need to look at the numbers to notice this changes. Maybe WotLK is the shift to ez-mode, as reflected by the DK class and changes to PvE. Not to mention how the completely imba PvP. Oh, they're fixing that, well maybe they shouldn't have rushed it out the door? Or maybe it is just me. My/Our only hope is that 3.1 balances to DK will weed out those who actually want to play it, from those who just like playing the OP class-of-the-moment.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">RWeber</div><div class="date">2009-03-17, 10:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I will not 'train' multiple days per week on WoW, every week, because it is a game, something to do in my free time. I work two jobs, and have four college classes, to boot. It's a great night when I can kick back and enjoy the game I'm paying every month for. I pay the same as everybody else - I should have a chance to at the very least see the content, if I'm good enough.<br />
<br />
So you want to play casually, that's great. What's not great is you demanding that people who want to play more than you or are more skilled than you shouldn't have content.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Those with the available time investment have the opportunity to get a great deal more loot, gear up significantly faster than everybody else, and can grind themselves away at doing hard modes<br />
<br />
My old 3-day per week guild that got into Sunwell in TBC has been reduced to 1-day per week guild for months now simply because it takes one night to clear all the 25-man hard mode content. The progression time from start of raiding to seeing 3 drakes go down was less than a month. Is it too much to ask to have 3 nights worth of 25-man raid content per week? Is it too much to ask to have some progression content?<br />
<br />
There are two reasons for the current failure that is WotLK raiding:<br />
1) WotLK was released with half the raid content of TBC release. This is completely unforgivable considering Blizzard got Naxx into WotLK essentially for free just by retuning the bosses.<br />
2) Everything is tuned for people new to raiding, meaning people who have raided before find everything too easy.<br />
<br />
The &quot;hard modes&quot; are nothing but handicaps applied to the same content. It doesn't make it exciting and it doesn't give you the same sense of achievement you got from downing hard bosses before.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What I hate is the 2-4% of the WoW population demanding that the most enjoyable, awesome, and amazing content be exclusively available to them, because they have the 'dedication' to spend hours upon hours at a time on WoW. Their dedication does not reduce the significance of their ability to outperform everybody else in WoW, but it's morally incomprehensible for them to demand exclusive access to the bulk of the game's content.<br />
<br />
I've got news for you. All WoW content is the same: gear up -&gt; learn tactics -&gt; practice execution -&gt; kill the boss -&gt; gear up -&gt; ...<br />
It's the same from the very first instance to the very last raid. The real problem are the people who think that anyone ahead of them in progression is seeing something more &quot;enjoyable, awesome, and amazing&quot;. They're not, they just move faster than you because they've got more skills or time or both.<br />
<br />
What is &quot;morally incomprehensible&quot; is you demanding that nobody shall see more content than you even if they are more skilled and spend more time in the game. Everyone should have content, people with more skills and more time need more content, that should be obvious.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizz has to draw an imaginary balancing line that makes the raids possible for people who can't invest weeks wiping on one boss over and over again, while still somehow making them satisfying to those that would love nothing more than to end a night with a final victory and a 600G repair bill. If satisfying both of those groups sounds impossible, that's probably because it is.<br />
<br />
It's not impossible, they did it in TBC. In TBC content was brought in over tuned to give a challenge to people who wanted that, and then progressively nerfed to allow everyone to keep progressing. No need to draw any &quot;imaginary balancing lines&quot;, everyone had content.</div></div><hr />

Now to my point. I do understand, and agree, with the &quot;normal&quot; mode and &quot;hard mode&quot; structure. That is totaly fine with me. However, the hard mode should REEEEAALLY be hard mode, like muru pre nerf. It is not! Blizzard have stated that they will never make another &quot;sunwell&quot; again. If they are going all out on hard modes Blizzard, why not make it REAAAALY hard? I would even go further and offer a completely new tier set in hard mode, not only some slight upgrades here and there.<br />

<br />
You want a real challenge and something that's REALLY hard?<br />
Roll a warrior to level 80 and play him as Arms in 2v2 arena before 3.1 comes out.<br />
Team up with whatever healer you want using a blue weapon and grind to gladiator constantly facing DK/Pally and Hunter/Pally teams prior to the lolsurival stun nerf.<br />
<br />
I'd like to see the percentage of wow that has the ability to do that. = (<br />
<br />
And sure, maybe pvp or arena doesn't interest you and you refuse to play because it's unbalanced. Well there's your challenge. It's possible to do it, you just have to be lucky, amazing, lucky and also lucky. Lucky in the sense that a great healer would play with you as Arms, amazing because wtf there's an Arms warrior at 2400+, lucky in the sense that your battlegroup is terribad and lucky in the sense that you don't constantly run into DK and Hunters.<br />
<br />

if your guild can kill 3d sarth, you will clear every boss that has been tested on the ptr thus far with very few wipes. Especially since the strats are already well established before reaching live. We know nothing about a couple of the bosses but if the ones tested are any indication, clearing it in week 1 will be pretty fucking easy.<br />

Gotta love the casuals who now think since they can clear easymode content that they own the game. This is exactly the attitude that is fulmenting the &quot;Elitist&quot; outrage, a bunch of nobodies can roll DKs power through 25 man raid content and smash faces, sure it's fun but you forget your playing an OP class on Easymode content and god forbid you run into a player who knows what the hell they are doing. The real draw back from this is that there isn't anything to shoot for any more, it used to be that players would see guys in T1 before it was properly skinned and those guys would be the envy of the server. Everyone salavated over a Rag hammer or T-furry, even TBC glaves and T6 belts were the driving ambition of the mid range crowd to do better, now though any 4 year old can get full T 7.5. Why try to be better at the game when bare minimal effort reaps the same reward as the uber dedicated?<br />
<br />
Also I'd like to ask a question I'm suprised no one else has pointed out. If 10 man content was introduced as a method of casuals to see content that they wouldn't see in 25 man why does 25 man content have to be tuned to casuals? I mean whats the point of easier (3 drake sarth excluded) 10 man content if the 25 man content is plenty easy anyways? If you want to raid for the experience of killing bosses and lore crap do the 10 man if you raid for challenge and glory let 25 man be hard. Nuf said.</div></div><hr />

If you are unhappy with the game then I suggest cancelling your account and searching out something more challenging that will be to your liking. You would likely be happier. <br />

That means that they will base their business on American principles. In America (my country) money is King. Greed will always overpower the QQers. Blizzard knows that if you give more people a chance to get cheaper and easier than what &quot;hardcore raiders&quot; had to do in vanilla and some TBC to get gear, recipes, mats, etc..., then more people will pay to play the game. So what if &quot;casual&quot; players can get the same epics as &quot;hardcore raiders&quot; with less effort. That's how it will be. Get used to it or WoWquit. The fact is that Blizzard knows that for every one person that does quit, twenty-five will take his place. That's business. In fact, that's &quot;good&quot; business from a greed outlook. I for one like the fact that I can be equal without neglecting my Real Life. I like that I can do top raids without having to be in-game seventeen hours a day. This is why I continue to pay and play. I started this game with vanilla (1.7 I think it was) and have seen noting but improvement in the basic play of the game. So... if you have a problem with WoW then maybe you need to put down the mouse and do your homework.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
This isn't really news. I've been saying this for months. Hard mode is supposed to be hard. Regular mode won't be much harder than Naxx and will probably be on level with 2 drakes and Malygos. They want the majority of the player base to see the content now.<br />
<br />
As for the SWP dude. Its good for you that you made it to SWP but you are insanely wrong if you think the entire population didn't want to make it there. They all wanted to get there they just didn't want to put in 7 days a week raiding with people they couldn't stand outside of raids just to get there. They decided to just not do it instead. Every raid in this game (NOT HARD MODES) should be pugable and still doable. It should require 2-3 nights tops to clear all content if you know what you are doing. If you don't like that then WoW 3.0 is not the game for you sorry. If you liked WoW 1.0 and WoW 2.0 that sucks because the majority of those 11,000,000 players played because there was nothing else available. New MMOs are coming out every month now to try to rip the WoW title as best PvE MMO away and if Blizzard doesn't start catering to more than 10% of their players those games will succeed.</div></div><hr />

To me atleast it seems like it.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW is a MMO not a e-sport. I'm a player not an athlete. Stop thinking you need to work harder in a game to enjoy it. You shouldn't have to. The best games (maybe not the ones with the biggest player base) catered very well to all players not just 10% of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Its ok just wait 6 more months and that loot Algalon dropped that you only needed to make easier to kill Algalon will look like crap when the new tier comes out. Right there lies the problem with the hard modes, Blizzard is going to make that gear crap by the time most casual guilds clear the hard modes. Most hard core guilds will probably do the hard modes in the first month then take time off. Hard mode is a joke.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Their dedication does not reduce the significance of their ability to outperform everybody else in WoW, but it's morally incomprehensible for them to demand exclusive access to the bulk of the game's content.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are still fail players in server first guilds. Granted they are normally friends of the officers or are officers or are GMs. Look on the bright side, most server first guilds in one tier don't stick around to be server firsts in the next tier because once all the players have done it once they can't put up with the asshat leaders that pretty much forced them to get there so they just take the rest of the expansion off or start raiding on alts in other guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me quote you on that seeing Wrath has been the most successful expansion in the history of the game I'm sure its because the game is dieing.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard have it so wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
No you do!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They had an awesome model, when raids were first released they were imba hard and many people couldn't even clear trash. This brought such an epic and legendary feeling to loot that many people were intrieged and drove them harder to play better.<br />
<br />
<br />
No it drove people to not bother raiding because they didn't feel they could raid. It wasn't until the end of TBC that many people started raiding and that was after the nerfs. Before then the vast majority of the players didn't even bother trying to get into T5 or T6 because of bad experiences with that content. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
When the first 10-50 guilds managed to complete the instance Blizzard would generally stealth nerf them and more guilds would trickle through to see end game content.<br />
<br />
<br />
They weren't nerfed as much you would like to think they were. A lot of them weren't nerfed at all and what you call nerfs was really bug fixes. So 10 guilds out of 500+ beat their heads on the wall before they bled and they got lucky with the RNG to get that one time with fewer bugs and downed it. That doesn't mean it was a good system.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
More stealth nerfs would happen, until eventually pugs could farm them. As the level cap is raised with expansions, the last of the people would get to see content.<br />
<br />
<br />
You mean more bug fixes happened to fix the rather broken content. Pugs were doing T4 about 2 months after TBC came out. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now blizzard has made everything wide open and accessable to everybody.<br />
Nothing is sacred, nothing is epic, nothing is legendary.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is a game. I for one don't pay for content I will never see. If that became the case again I would go play WAR which is a much better game developed by a much better company that just so happens to not have a lot of PvE content. However, if Blizzard insists on the stupidity of raid lock out again to all but 10% of the population they will be about tied with WAR on PvE content and WAR has powned them hardcore in the PVP content so anyone that doesn't like raiding would probably end up playing WAR not WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
They have shot themselves right in the foot.<br />
<br />
<br />
No they have done what it takes to keep the majority of their player base. If you don't like then leave. They would rather lose 5-10% then 75-90%.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All making content easy to do is accelerate the process of which the game is dieing. People willl complete Ulduar and not bother playing again.<br />
<br />
<br />
You know these &quot;the game is dieing&quot; posts got old with UO and EQ. Both games are still doing just fine 12 years after the posts started getting made. WoW has 11,000,000 players so STFU about it &quot;dieing&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What a load of croc this is.<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree completely. Everything above this point in your post is a total load of croc coming from some hardcore player that can't stand to see his 1337 epics devalued. Here is a hint, much like live, THIS GAME IS NOT ABOUT YOU!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Give back sunwell difficulty and nerf the instance when the first few guilds start to complete it. Its miles better than this bullcrap &quot;lets pretend to make content last longer by giving it hard modes&quot; structure.<br />
<br />
<br />
Please do us all a favor and go play FFXI. Hell, they have a boss there that takes you at least 24 hours to kill. That should be just up your hardcore alley. We wouldn't have to listen to you whine about how hard it isn't when you probably whined about how hard it was in TBC and you would be able to experience truly hardcore raid content. Its a win for everyone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-03-17, 09:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hard modes are exactly what hardcore raiders want isnt it? A challenge? I mean you're not just around to show off your l33t armor and brag about how big your epeen is right? <br />
<br />
<br />
There in lies the problem. That is EXACTLY what &quot;hardcore&quot; players want out of this game. Why do you think &quot;hardcore&quot; guilds end up selling those titles after they have cleared everything. To buy the twilight vanquisher title on my server it cost 3000 gold. Back in the day, you could buy war bear from ZA for about 1000 gold. Its people like this that are the most vocal minority in this game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-03-17, 09:24 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I do think that needing more people makes it harder, and requiring each of those 25 people to be skilled is important to raising the difficulty (rather than it was in the 40 man).<br />
<br />
<br />
You would be so completely incorrect its not even funny. In a 25 man you can bring 5 people that are under geared and generally suck and still walk right through it. Try bringing 5 people that suck into a 10 man and see if you can get past the first boss. TEN MAN IS HARDER! <br />
<br />
Not to mention you can do every fight in Naxx25 with 20 people. You can do VoA25 and OS25 with 15 people. They just have to be geared well and not suck. The enrage timer on VoA25 is so completely retarded that if you have 10 geared and competent dps you will still come out 1 minute ahead of the timer.<br />
<br />
<br />
most raiding guilds raid 4-5 day a week which probably isn't considered casual.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most &quot;HARDCORE&quot; (by which I mean those that min/max still and expect their players to be top game and kick those that aren't and recruit those that are) raiding guilds raid 1 night a week and clear all content in about 5 hours. Most casual raiding guilds (those that actually accept casuals and bads) raid about 4-5 nights a week for about 3 hours a night. That makes it even more interesting when talking about hardcore versus casual/bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What some 'hardcore' players are saying (maybe poorly) is that Blizzard went from catering to them primarily to handing out 'free' loot to the 'noob' masses, while not providing them the same challenge. The hard-mode has yet to be a real challenge, and 30-40% is still quite high considering the 'old days'. This Hardcore group may just be griping/QQing, but there is a lack of challenging end-game content that in the past was always there.<br />
<br />
<br />
What these hardcore asshats fail to realize is that if you can tie your own shoes you can clear all end game raiding content if you care to do so in WoW and its been like that since WoW 1.0. 40 man raiding content WAS NOT HARD. TBC WAS NOT HARD. Wrath is not hard. WoW 1.0 had ways for casuals to get decent loot (MC and ZG could both be done with pugs in the group that were not even geared) and that doesn't even include UBRS and the quest systems to turn your dungeon blue drops in epics. In TBC badge loot was all epic and some of it was best in slot (even before sunwell) and it was given out freely to casuals.<br />
<br />
Most of these hardcore asshats are also whining about the lack of difficult encounters but they have yet to clear Maly25 on the timer, get the Glory of the Raider (Heroic) or get 3 drakes down on 25 man. If you ask them about it they say that achievements shouldn't make for harder content. I say if you don't want to do achievements then you shouldn't be asking for harder content because obviously you want the easy mode to begin with or you would have the achievements already.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't care if you identify as Hardcore or Casual, this game like any game should be challenging, that is what makes a game fun - the challenge of achieving a goal/receiving a reward. <br />
<br />
<br />
IMO, you couldn't be more wrong. In a normal video game yes it is the challenge that makes it more fun. MMOs are DIFFERENT. In MMOs its the people you play with that make the game. If you want to get your fun from a challenge then go play console. If you want to get your fun from doing content with other players then play MMOs. There is a huge reason truly hardcore gamers still see MMOs as a joke and that is because the focus of MMOs should be different then the focus of truly hardcore solo player games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Like it or not WOW IS NOT ABOUT YOU! Stop making absurd comments like this. No one actually cares about you. They care about the player base as a whole. That there is the reason people get tired of hardcore whine. Its all from players that think because they have done more than everyone else they are better than everyone else and everyone else should bow down before them. This is a game. If you think its about you the I don't want to know what you think about RL.</div></div><hr />

Why wont they just add survival talents to other trees if they want all 3 specs to be able to tank? A great mystery indeed.<br />
<br />
<br />
3.1 greatly lessened the viability of dk tanks while greatly increasing the viability of paladin tanks. Its not hard to see that the best trash tank and aoe tank after 3.1 will be the paladin hands down. They didn't need to make it so dks had issues tanking at all though. I guess dks and druids are just supposed to be dps after 3.1. Oh wait, they are getting nerfed their to because they are a &quot;hybrid&quot; that won't be able to tank.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daez</div><div class="date">2009-03-17, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you want to play casually, that's great. What's not great is you demanding that people who want to play more than you or are more skilled than you shouldn't have content.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think he ever demanded that. Its more like, so you want to play HARDCORE, that's great. What's not great is you demanding that people who don't want to stroke their epeen through a video game not be able to raid at all. Its not the casuals that are demanding a change in end game its the hardcore players. The casuals are happy being casual.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My old 3-day per week guild that got into Sunwell in TBC has been reduced to 1-day per week guild for months now simply because it takes one night to clear all the 25-man hard mode content. The progression time from start of raiding to seeing 3 drakes go down was less than a month. Is it too much to ask to have 3 nights worth of 25-man raid content per week? Is it too much to ask to have some progression content?<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG, Blizzard please don't force me to get a life. If you don't make me raid 7 nights a week I might have to do something productive 6 nights a week. Please don't make me do that. Is that pretty much what you are saying?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What is &quot;morally incomprehensible&quot; is you demanding that nobody shall see more content than you even if they are more skilled and spend more time in the game. Everyone should have content, people with more skills and more time need more content, that should be obvious.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is not obvious and its not &quot;morally incomprehensible&quot;. You need to redefine your meaning of that word. I would think demanding the ability to profit from the works of others is much closer to the true meaning of the phrase. Perhaps you missed that those casuals (90% of the player base) are PAYING FOR THAT CONTENT that you don't think they should be able to see because although they PAID FOR IT they didn't &quot;work as hard as you did to see it&quot;. You are a joke.</div></div><hr />

Like it or not the reason I phrased it the way I did is because I am not capable of speaking for others. I am not an elected official for semi-hardcore players, unlike you who seems to speak on behalf of everybody, even Blizzard representatives as to who they care about the opinions of. Now it is obvious you're just retarded and don't understand that I and many other intelligent people don't enjoy being spoken for without our consent I ask that you kindly STFU, and let others speak for themselves. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is I'm saying that my account is not being renewed when the current time runs out because Blizzard has made this game like an online version of Mario Party. An unchallenging collection of minigames even a chimp could eventually beat.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fantomspower</div><div class="date">2009-03-18, 12:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You would be so completely incorrect its not even funny. In a 25 man you can bring 5 people that are under geared and generally suck and still walk right through it. Try bringing 5 people that suck into a 10 man and see if you can get past the first boss. TEN MAN IS HARDER! <br />
<br />
Not to mention you can do every fight in Naxx25 with 20 people. You can do VoA25 and OS25 with 15 people. They just have to be geared well and not suck. The enrage timer on VoA25 is so completely retarded that if you have 10 geared and competent dps you will still come out 1 minute ahead of the timer.<br />
<br />
<br />
I am not commenting on the current state of the 25-man system. I don't want 5 under-geared people to be able to enter in the raid. My point is that 25 man should, key word, should be harder, while 10 mans be made easier. If you are casual it would be easier to get 10 people together at one time than it is to get 25 man. I am talking about the hypothetical situation that Blizzard could and I think should have implemented rather than the current system.<br />
<br />
<br />
Most &quot;HARDCORE&quot; (by which I mean those that min/max still and expect their players to be top game and kick those that aren't and recruit those that are) raiding guilds raid 1 night a week and clear all content in about 5 hours. Most casual raiding guilds (those that actually accept casuals and bads) raid about 4-5 nights a week for about 3 hours a night. That makes it even more interesting when talking about hardcore versus casual/bad.<br />
<br />
Hardcore, at first spend the time to beat the raid-instance. I don't know what guilds you are talking about, but I don't think there is any guild that just walks into a raid for the first time and clears it in one night. Also, in the past there are were many different raid instances to complete all the &quot;harcore&quot; guilds you are talking about do raid 4-6 days per week. You're telling me that in TBC Hardcore guilds cleared every raid-instance in a day? <br />
<br />
Casual people don't raid 4-5 nights a week. They are not casual if they do. Also, the many guilds that do raid 4-6 nights a week that require a minimum attendance are &quot;hardcore&quot; where casuals do not. The speed of progression of a guild that raids 4-6 nights with an attendance policy is not what defines &quot;hardcore,&quot; and hardcore doesn't even mean raiding, it is defined by time spent in game per-week.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO, you couldn't be more wrong. In a normal video game yes it is the challenge that makes it more fun. MMOs are DIFFERENT. In MMOs its the people you play with that make the game.

<br />
The social aspect of a MMO is an important part of the game and does make it fun, but the gameplay (RPG) aspect still holds to that of a single player game, and that means there needs to be a challenge. In a MMO however, teamwork is needed to complete this challenge. Without the challenge there is no teamwork and there is no point of grouping together. When you can PuG Naxx the idea of teamwork is thrown out of the window. I know that for myself and for most in my guild the fun is working together, yes working together, to overcome the challenges in the game. MMO aren't different at all, it just adds a social aspect of teamwork to the gameplay.<br />
<br />
I post to discuss, not argue. So I will not reply to any more of your posts that only try to argue. It is not about being right or wrong. We all have our own experience with this game, yet it is a game. In turn, we all have our own unique opinion base on said experiences.</div></div><hr />

Reading it i got realy disappointing yet again i learned nothing new.<br />
<br />
The real truth behind this all are ppl that are steamed with hate and envy waching &quot;us&quot; from some dark god forbiden hole for years<br />
thriving due too our hard work and actual skill too do something right (call it no life if you will i dont give a cent).<br />
<br />
And now what you do?!<br />
I tell you what you come out of that &quot;hole&quot; full of your self with &quot;EPICZ ZOMG GIFF :o&quot; that only in your head is <br />
/epic lvl 80=skill/ right ??? RONG!!!<br />
It is now that you show your true face,walking in towns with full epic gear TOTALY unbalanced showing what epic gear is realy too you,not a gear upgrade so you can show your skill in full light but a mere shiny thing with that great moto you all practise in PUG,s (if its not red it belong on my head :P)<br />
<br />
Stick with blue gear will you,at least that way you can say its not my skill its my gear am good you know :-[<br />
<br />
Game is NOT doing great,you cant see that now but in time ppl will stop playing if this continiues,why? cos there will be no chalange left even for those pokemons that actualy think mail box is there so you can sit on it.<br />
<br />
The real question is,if you have it all i mean all you want with minimal effort(this is for RL also) you simply lose interest in it.<br />
<br />
I just cant quote all post that i want too so i will tell this in general:<br />
All of you BIG real life macho mans,if you are what you say you are what the f..k are you doing on MMO posting....<br />
Let me tell you a litle secret,The skill for you too enter a good guild and too have a minimal skill in team play for raid is called?!?&quot;(what can it be) ok ok spell it with me S O C I A L skill.....<br />
<br />
And for what i have seen how you respond too posts ppl made,not that you dont have social skill MAN you lack basic communication skills.<br />
<br />
And with this i leave you,deal WITH IT dont cry a river or whine about how things are unfair :'(,for the love of god you cant deal with a GAME! i realy dont want too see you in action on some work!<br />
<br />

<br />
Sorry to break this to you, but the majority of hardcore gamers I've met don't give a crap what you think about them or their epeens. They're too busy worrying about their progress to stroke any epeens. Sure there are kids who are being carried through content that think their gear means something, but nobody cares about them anyway.<br />
<br />
I never said that only hardcore should be able to raid. Had you actually read and comprehended what I wrote you'd know that I was advocating the complete opposite: Everyone should have SOME content regardless of how skilled they are or how much time they spend in the game. NOT that everyone should see ALL content.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
OMG, Blizzard please don't force me to get a life. If you don't make me raid 7 nights a week I might have to do something productive 6 nights a week. Please don't make me do that. Is that pretty much what you are saying?<br />
<br />
So not only do you want to dictate how people play the game, but you also want to dictate how they live their lives? Arguments like this work especially well coming from someone posting in MMO forums.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That is not obvious and its not &quot;morally incomprehensible&quot;. You need to redefine your meaning of that word. I would think demanding the ability to profit from the works of others is much closer to the true meaning of the phrase.<br />
<br />
You would think wrong. Also it's completely irrelevant to the debate, nobody is &quot;profiting form the works of others&quot; here.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Perhaps you missed that those casuals (90% of the player base) are PAYING FOR THAT CONTENT that you don't think they should be able to see because although they PAID FOR IT they didn't &quot;work as hard as you did to see it&quot;. You are a joke.<br />
<br />
First of all, you are a joke for making up fake quotes. Second, I never did PvP yet by your definition I'm paying for it so I should be given all the current season's gear so I have a chance to see the PvP endgame. Everyone pays the same for this game and everyone should have something to do in the game. It does NOT mean that everyone should be able to see everything, that's absurd in a game this huge. That's just how flat rate pricing works, people who play less subsidize those who play more (in a sense). If you don't like it you should be calling for pay-as-you-go pricing.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roshnaks</div><div class="date">2009-03-19, 03:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Your point on the pvp and stuff is right but have some wrongness. Even though you can't access top levels of pvp with minimal efforts, the content is accessible at all times. It's sure people beeing carried on ( lack of skill / gear blah blah) is dull but as previously said, they pay for the content. What is really needed, ( imo :) ), is challenging raids and dungeons but accessible on differents levels of difficulty. That's what blizz seems to want to do with the hard mode. Although not getting the same level of gear, they get to see the game at least.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">amenchant</div><div class="date">2009-03-19, 05:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is one more example of comprehensives ppl have worl wide.<br />
So you &quot;PAID FOR IT&quot;(with caps so we all see you paid for it) and you anticipate by that all world should do as you want tham to do,tell me is that normal?<br />
<br />
Let me give you one example,lets say you want too learn too dance and you go too dance school and start you class,<br />
now dance school is realy expensive and trainer and other senior dancers are realy good muving too fast for you.<br />
And what you do,you dont try too learn what thay do,no whay should you make any effort too do that ffs &quot;YOU PAID FOR IT&quot; So you tell all of tham too slow down thay are no lifers cos thay dance all day and thay should &quot;nerf&quot; dance class(AHAHHAHA) cos you dont have skill too follow tham,and thay are all idiots cos thay are trying so hard pfff.<br />
<br />
You going too college or at least you did or you are yet too go,you will pay tham,will you tell collage profesor too STFU and give you A+ cos you payed for it(ok you will not have his knowledge(hard mode epic,s)but you will go troo all collage and see all grades(expirience content)whay cos YOU PAID FOR IT<br />
<br />
Now for those who will make joke of this and wach on it literally do as you please but try too look big picture of what you are saying.<br />
Saying I PAID FOR IT and not even trying too give your best makes you &quot;self-centred&quot;,&quot;spoilt&quot;,&quot;immature&quot; (i know this game is 12+) but still good luck with that standpoint in life you will have &quot;hard core&quot; ride for sure just what you want of wow.</div></div><hr />

And then they make us charge in combat (why not just move heroic fury over to arms?)<br />
<br />
This is stupid blizz.<br />
<br />
TY FOR TG NURF THOUGH. <br />
It is by far the best 51 point talent ablity in the game for ANY class. Its nurf is well needed, in fact imho it should be completly removed.</div></div><hr />
