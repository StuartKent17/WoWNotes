A tank’s job is to protect the group. A big part of that is controlling the enemy. A big part of controlling the enemy is staying alive. Tanks have a lot of tools to stay alive, and mastering those is a major component of learning to play a tank. On the other hand, some of these tools are on long cooldowns, and on some encounters they are intended for use at specific moments in the fight. Furthermore, staying alive isn’t the sole responsibility of the tank, because there will always be one or more healers present whose job it is to keep the tank alive. As such, staying alive can’t be the only thing tanks have to focus on.<br />
<br />
So, let’s back up a moment to controlling the enemy. “Control” includes things like positioning the boss, or doing specific things at specific times, such as swapping with an off tank. It also includes making sure the boss doesn’t attack anyone else. That’s where threat generation comes into play.<br />
<br />
If threat generation is too easy then the entire risk of the encounter drops. Newsflash: we don’t actually want encounters to be easy. We want encounters to be fun, and for most players, that includes both rewards and risks.<br />
<br />
We want tanks to care about the buttons they hit instead of just relying on auto-attacking to control their target. We don’t necessarily want very complicated tank DPS rotations, because as I mentioned above, tanks do have other things to keep track of. But we want their combat abilities to be engaging. Good tanks should be those who control, survive, and generate sufficient threat.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, when threat is too hard to maintain, it can be exasperating. Tanks get understandably frustrated when the game is asking them to do something but not giving them the tools to do it. The non-tanks in the group also become frustrated, because they feel throttled. It’s one thing when overcoming the boss is challenging. It feels worse when you know that another player is standing in your way, keeping you from achieving your top performance.<br />
<br />
We don’t usually want DPS classes to have to stop attacking in order to keep from generating too much threat. We do want players to pay attention. We don’t think it’s too much to ask for DPS and healers to wait a couple of GCDs for the tank to get the enemy under control -- we’re not asking for five stacks of Sunder Armor these days. What we really mean by proper threat management is knowing things like when it’s time to go all out, when it’s appropriate to use a threat-reducing cooldown, and most importantly, which is the right target to be attacking. I’m not trying to bash pugs here, but I am amazed at how often a nuker will pick a random target instead of the one being tanked, then blame the tank for not holding aggro (and then blame the healer when they die). In short, if threat is too easy, the game is boring. If threat is too difficult, the game is frustrating.<br />
<br />
How then do you guys (and the developers!) know when threat is a problem? Here are some handy guidelines.<br />
<br />
-- If a tank is trying to generate threat on a single target, and it runs off to kill a DPS class, that’s a problem.<br />
<br />
-- If a tank is trying to generate area threat on a group, and the tanked things are running off to kill healers, that’s a problem.<br />
<br />
-- If Vengeance falling off causes the tank to lose threat, that’s a problem.<br />
<br />
These problems can have a couple of causes. It could be a problem we caused, meaning that even an expertly-played tank has low threat generation because our numbers are undertuned. Or it could be that only an expertly-played tank can generate threat because you’re asked to manage too many abilities. Or it could be that Vengeance is the only thing allowing you to generate enough threat because the size of the buff is masking low threat generation from your abilities. It could also be a problem you need to fix on your end: if someone is nuking or cleaving a random target on a group pull instead of assisting the tank, that’s not the tank’s fault.<br />
<br />
Now, there are things we don’t like about threat as a mechanic. It’s fairly gamey as game mechanics go and we think there are probably better ways to communicate it to players. There are some mods that do a very credible job given the limited information we provide, but overall we’d like to present threat better since we’re asking you to take it seriously in the PvE game.<br />

<br />
This is by far my #1 frustration as a tank. I would say its about 20-30% of the trash packs that I will hit the main dps target with all my single target hits, hit my AE's to pick up other targets, and yet an offtarget ends up running off towards a DPS even though I've never even targeted that mob. I either have to try and taunt it and hope that it sticks long enough to get to me for additional threat or I have to running after it which just adds additional chaos to the mix.<br />
<br />
Also people with ranged silences have got to me more conscious about getting casters to come into the group. I don't know how many times I've had a caster sitting in the middle of a bunch of CC'd mobs casting at a healer/dps only to know that I run a real risk of breaking other things by running in after it. We are here to work as a team. We should know what roles people need to take in the group, but when it comes down too it in the end you're all in it together.<br />
<br />
#2 would be the people who queue up knowing they only have like 20-30 mins to get the run done and expect you to just fly through it will no regard for anything. Dungeons take time again...be patient people are still learning the fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agree 100%....I'm constantly having to move around and adjust because mobs decide that to hit me they need to run half-way through me...Or hitting me with melee attacks even though I'm obviously more than 8yds away from their hit box. Why am I losing threat on this mob to only realize the red text at the top says you're too far from your target.<br />

Oh do i ever agree with you..This is what blizz gets for litch king and basically handing loot out instead of making ppl earn their loot. As For threat yah i thing all those nerfs to tanks really made it harder on threat BUTTTTTT if ppl hold off on attacking the mob before or at same time as tank it can be handled pretty good. PPL just need to remember how WOW was at lv 60 and get used to the fact strategy is a must again and the days of zerging are over.<br />
DPS can't just be worried about being number one on the meters anymore .</div></div><hr />

I don't know how out dated my comment is going to be since I stopped playing Mid way through WoLK for my university studies... Having completed all Vanilla Raids and TBC Raids as a MT, I thoroughly enjoyed the threat factor for tanks. I seen it as my own personal challenge, to try and make my Threat per second higher every single encounter, Try and out do myself so that DPS could just go flat out...<br />
<br />
Knowing that there was pressure on me to generate threat, so other players could enjoy there class by zerging, doing what they do best, is what made it fun for me, and quite satisfying too!! <br />
<br />
I for one, enjoy the threat factor, I Can't be sure how true this will be when I re-activate my account for Cataclysm, but watching Streams, Videos, and Reading this forum, I can honestly say, it seems like the &quot;urge&quot; to play is coming back!</div></div><hr />

I know there is some kind of debuff now if you leave during a lfg instance. Something MORE needs to happen then just a debuff, the other night our group went through 5 tanks before a DK tanked the rest of the instance after the first boss.

Don't worry Jaerin, I've got your back on point #1. As the party healer I just let the character in your example die. Even if I know I can keep them alive I let them die. A smart player will understand what they did wrong and make the necessary adjustment (they call that learning), while the not-so-smart player will abuse you or me then drop group and we will get a fresh recruit who is hopefully smart. Agree 100% with point #2. Smooth and controlled is infinitely more important that fast and chaotic.</div></div><hr />

Moonkins and mages particularlly on the pull just do ridiculous threat where they have to backoff quite often depending on RNG (does heroic throw or first shield slam crit, or worse, didi get parriedon first shield slam). Later in fight it's complete none issue. For me a fight that stands out as annoying though is Maloriak. Tight berserk timer for entry level gear, and tank has to worry about positioning, threat, and interupts, all within first 10 seconds of pull. While dps aren't holding back cause they cannot afford it. i've had boss pulled off me more than once if i got a bad rng parry with first attack. Was it raid wiping? no, he's tauntable, just annoying. i still thnk vengence is a crap design that doesn't help with initial aggro, only maintaining it later fight. tank damage just needs to not be so ridiculously low for all non druid tanks since they cannot gear for threat/mtiigation at same time like druids can without sacrificing significant effective health. more mitigation to threat talents like armored to teeth, then throw out vengence cause if your damage scales with your stamina, or armor, then you won't fall behind dps as those states will crease at exponential rates just like the dps, eliminating the need to even have such a gimmicky vengence mechanic.</div></div><hr />

thats just retarded<br />
<br />
It's not as retarded as you think. The entire concept of threat and tanking is completely alien to 99% of games. If these bosses are sometimes thousands of years old and renown for their treachery and cunning, they won't care about a mere's mortal taunts and grandstanding. They will swipe at and crush underfoot whoever they please, in whichever order they please. The idea that casters and healers should not take direct hits is what's retarded.<br />
<br />
Dedicated healers are another awful concept. Even clerics in classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons fought with maces and wore chainmail. They get down and dirty and can take a licking!<br />

Anyways, I have no problems as a feral tank (which i presume is going to be nerfed for damage/threat output) generating threat and generally surviving.<br />
<br />
Stuff only goes wrong from a tank perspective when I mess up, though there is plenty of room for error between wiping and not. Tanking atm is slightly more interesting than Wrath, but I feel that after the little period of change in 4.0.1, everything is as easy as ever.</div></div><hr />

The entire concept of threat and tanking is completely alien to 99% of games. If these bosses are sometimes thousands of years old and renown for their treachery and cunning, they won't care about a mere's mortal taunts and grandstanding. They will swipe at and crush underfoot whoever they please, in whichever order they please. The idea that casters and healers should not take direct hits is what's retarded.<br />
<br />
Dedicated healers are another awful concept. Even clerics in classic Dungeons &amp; Dragons fought with maces and wore chainmail. They get down and dirty and can take a licking!<br />
<br />
This is exactly why I'm jumping ship when GuildWars 2 comes out. Threat is artificial and gimp. It's a poor simulation of how combat, even fantasy combat, is conducted.<br />
Wrong. Using your D&amp;D example, healers and other squishies were positioned at the back of the party so there was a reduced chance they take damage. The concept being that the high HP classes took the brunt of the damage. The 3 roles in WoW are fine.</div></div><hr />

And although there are still some kinks to work out, overall I'm enjoying how parties have to work around threat problems.<br />
<br />
I currently play a Frost DK and gearing up to go back to tanking, The main problem that I've faced atm is simply that it is very easy to do a lot of damage, and fast. This has always been a concern for me as a Frost DK. Yes other classes and specs suffer from massive burst threat as well, but it's brutally hard to control my threat across the board without dropping my DPS output my a large margin.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
During a guild run last night (normal Vortex, players lvl 83-85) we out level and out gear the place so it was just a fun run and I got time to play around with my burst and threat values.<br />
Our tank, an 85 warrior ilvl 333 (or there abouts) with backup from rogue TotT could tank every group fine, we used CC only on double adept pulls. But I found that assisting his target on the pull and dropping AoE after everyone else started would still see me forced to single target and changing to a fresh threat target every 10-15 seconds to ensure my threat didn't jump to high. More often than not, by the latter half of the pull I would have to drop my rotations completely and just auto attack or contend with pulling 1-2 targets from the tank.<br />
<br />
Yes I am an agro whore and like I said, we weren't doing a serious run so I went harder than I normally would. But since DK's have absolutely no threat drop abilities I've come to dropping tank abilities like Icebound during runs and Off Tanking 1-2 mobs. It works pretty well, but in pugs it's definitely not something I want to have to rely on since healers hate DPS pulling agro and I don't have the self healing of Blood to support it.<br />
<br />
Massive wall of text, sorry guys. But now that threat is more in line with how it should be, groups are going to have to be prepared for these kinds of problems. I for one enjoy the off tanking a little as I have the abilities to soak it, but not drop the threat. Frost DK's just have very unpredictable jumps in threat levels and this is going to happen more and more without a way to drop some agro, or the party compensating and assigning some off tank targets.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idletime</div><div class="date">2010-12-17, 12:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a simple rule when tanking in Pug normals and heroics, and probably the only way you will ever teach the lawlcrafters out there that routinely dps the wrong target and will be best for everyone. You simply have to teach some people how this game works, because half of them today came in after Wrath.<br />
<br />
1) Mark your target. Make a macro for the attack that you use primarily that throws up a raid mark and executes the attack. Icy Touch, Judgement, Heroic Throw, Rend, Mangle, whatever. &quot;Star is my target, assist me. Don't dps anything else.&quot;<br />
2) If people choose to continue using AOE (busting sheeps, saps, whatever) when asked not to, then use the Vote to Kick option.<br />
3) If people choose to dps whatever they feel like, do what I do. Give them a repair bill. Don't taunt it back until after it's killed that idiot. Negotiate with your healer that if someone pulls a mob without your mark off you, let them die. Eventually they'll rage quit. I had one persistent jerk get completely broken in one run, which I found hilarious. If enough people follow this simple rule, they'll either stop doing it, L2Play, or quit entirely. The more social you are, the better.<br />
<br />
Tanks also have to do their jobs however. LOS the mobs, position them properly, and face them away from the party so they aren't taking cone attacks to the face. Melee that chooses to stand with the tank dies, easy as that.<br />
<br />
There's nothing hard about tanking in Cata, it's quite easy. The hard part is getting people over the learning curve so some toughlove is in order.</div></div><hr />

I think a threat nerf needs to be done. Im a DK tank, the AoE tanking is abit hard. But its still to easy sometimes. And the Single Target Tanking. Wow, thats retarded. Im at around 5000 threat when the boss is done (If standing still most of the time). While the dps are at like 1000, maybe 1500. But when it comes to kiting Im usualy not that high over the DPS. But just enough to make sure boss isnt on the DPS. And for adds under boss periods I have no struggle there either most of the time. I have two taunts, makes it really easy for me. <br />

<br />
I’m not trying to bash pugs here, but I am amazed at how often a nuker will pick a random target instead of the one being tanked, then blame the tank for not holding aggro<br />
Amazed? Really? I don't think it's that hard to understand once you've played both roles.<br />
<br />
When you're tanking you're in the middle of everything, you're focusing entirely on the position and number of monsters you're engaged with. You pay attention to who's attacking what and tabbing through targets to hold threat. It's very fun really and it's what I enjoy about tanking.<br />
<br />
But when you're a ranged DPS at 40 yards, what tools do you exactly have for telling which target you should be attacking? You're nowhere near the center of the fight and you can't exactly change your camera point of view. You're stuck with watching the fight from the sidelines as you have to figure out which target to start sending your arrows or magic bolts at rather fast. <br />
<br />
These are the tools that Blizzard has implemented:<br />
<br />
1) Assist the tank.<br />
<br />
Assist allows you to acquire someone else's target such as the tank's. The problem with that is many tanks tab through targets to keep aggro so even when people assist the tank, they might just end up hitting that target the tank only meant to get a single Sunder on before moving on to the next target. Assisting the tank is not the ideal way of maintaining aggro especially since AoE threat was nerfed to the point where you can't tank groups by just hitting 1 button anymore. In fact, as a tank I barely keep the same target for more than 6 seconds as I tab target a lot to keep threat as a Warrior.<br />
<br />
2) Hit the target with lowest health.<br />
<br />
You can toggle the display of health bars above monsters to see how much health they have remaining and find the targets that are close to death. Killing the targets with lowest health helps the group a lot by reducing the damage output to the tank faster, but a lot of damage dealing classes rely on combinations and rotations and only switching to targets when they're low on health disputes their DPS a lot and makes the mob itself die even slower. The damage dealers need to be on that target from the beginning for it to have any effect. This also brings us to another problem: Monsters don't have enough health for it to matter. If 3 DPS focus on one target then that target will die before some classes can reach their highest DPS, so it's in fact more effective to pick your own target and kill that. How is that an effective design?<br />
<br />
3) Make a kill order using marks.<br />
<br />
A player can assign icons above the monster's head which can be used to indicate priority or special moves for the target such as &quot;kill first&quot; or &quot;sheep this&quot;. This is probably the only in-game method that actually works because it's trivializing the problem, only setting up marks for every group is both tiresome and annoying and usually falls to the tank as well. But if you don't do it, then we're back to trash not mattering and just AoEing your way through content.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem here is the trash. The only thing that decides whether coordination is necessary is if the trash is too dangerous to fight uncontrolled. Even if you hit random targets the tank can usually pick it up even if it's frustrating and the healer can usually heal through it even if it's draining his mana. As long as it's possible for the DPS to put the burden elsewhere, they will. Not because they're lazy but because trash is boring. That's why we call it trash. There's way too much trash in instances that's not moderately interesting. People level up in instances like Scarlet Monastery that favors pulling trash packs together and just AoE'ing the crap out of it. At the same time, there's no way for the DPS to really follow the tank's threat management because they're either too far away to actually see the fight or lack the tools to easily coordinate the group's attacks.<br />
<br />
In Wrath, the only thing that made coordination and crowd control necessary was if the trash either hit too hard for the tank to withstand the damage or had abilities that threw the fight into chaos. This worked when players stepped into heroics for the first time in their quest gear, and it worked when players stepped into a new tier of raid with new gear. The problem was never AoE threat or people attacking random targets, the problem was gear overpowering players to the point where the risk of death went away.<br />
<br />
In Cata, the only thing that has really changed is the tank's way of generating threat. Instead of encouraging teamwork by making focusing trash necessary, you're punishing the tank by trying to make it impossible for the tank to keep aggro (emphasis on try because I'm still AoE tanking the same way in anything but heroics). Aggro isn't the problem here and neither the solution. You have to stop being so incredibly lazy when you design trash. You just redesigned the entire old world and guess what? Trash is still trash! It's only in a heroic that you'll see otherwise, so it's not a freaking surprise when damage dealers step into their Cataclysm dungeons and don't know a dim about teamwork or crowd control because it has become a heroic thing only.<br />
<br />
They can't see the center of the fight. They don't have the tools to easily follow it either. You have to go out of your way and mark targets up to the point where it becomes too obvious. Here's what I would do if I were to encourage more teamwork:<br />
<br />
1) Give the players more camera tools. Seriously don't stick the camera just to the player's point of view. There are a few spells and abilities that can do this such as Far Sight and Eagle Eye, but make a default feature that allows you to toggle your camera to follow someone else's point of view like the tank's. This will make it 100% funnier for ranged DPS to follow the fight and pick the right targets.<br />
<br />
2) Health bars display above mobs health? How about threat amount? I use an add-on called Threat Bars to display health bars differently depending on how much threat I have on them, but this only works for avoid losing threat. There's no way of telling what targets have the most threat without actually tabbing through most of them with some threat meter add-on and then looking for the highest numbers. It seriously shouldn't be hard to tell what target the tank is generating most threat on without having to mark everything up.<br />
<br />
3) INCREASE the health and damage of ALL trash. There's no point in asking players to learn teamwork if it's NOT necessary. You're catering incredibly much to the undergeared tank player that can barely take any punishment through most leveling instances instead of just giving the tanks proper gear through quest rewards (which there is almost none of outside instances and crafting professions). Then reduce the amount of trash in instances with too much of it and allow players to maintain a decent time rate without having to spend forever clearing buffed trash.<br />
<br />
4) Make teamwork rewarding. I can't stress this enough. As a Warrior, I can Sunder my target to increase physical DPS so that physical damage dealers do more damage to my target. That's a great reason to attack the same targets as me! Except that I barely have ANY globals to spare when I'm tanking trash because I constantly need to hit Thunder Clap, Revenge and Shockwave on every cooldown as well as tab target when that's not enough. Give the tanks more and better tools for amplifying damage on their main targets so damage dealers should / will want to hit them over picking a fresh target to better do their job.<br />
<br />
5) Face that bad groups will fail and that's what they're intended to do. You can't create a learning curve if everything is face-roll. You really have to get to the absolute end of the game before players actually wipe over things like not using Polymorph or Sap to reduce the amount of damage on the tank. Give the players these tools early and force them to get used to it. Encourage players to play dungeons and get into the learning curve. Make the player's level a statement of his or her progress on that learning curve as well.<br />
<br />
It's NOT saying normals should be hard to get through, but it IS saying that damage dealers need a responsibility in the group when it's not challenging beyond the mashing of buttons. Having monsters that's better left crowd controlled is a great thing and having reasons to assist the tank is a great thing. The group environment should inspire teamwork, not just require a tank and healer for another joy ride. This is the problem with WoW's random dungeons atm.<br />
<br />
When I rolled into Outland I found a group of 67s and we decided to do some of the more difficult dungeons like SL where even though I had amazing gear, we still had to pull carefully and use crowd control like Death Grip to bring casters to the tank or a frost trap at the healer to protect him from the stealthing rogue patrols. It was absolutely an amazing experience and I didn't even have to hit 85 to get it. In the end of our runs everyone was incredibly happy and sad that they had to part way with such an amazing group knowing full well what an amount of boring trash they had to go through to be able to experience something like that again.</div></div><hr />

Heroics are very demanding that you CC correctly, pull correctly, heal correctly, have high DPS, etc etc. One missing link is often a wipe. A nerf to threat would probably be the straw right now for a lot of people... the DPS are required to do their absolute best and if they pull something on them in a heroic theres a high chance they are dead and the tank could lose threat on the other mobs trying to get that one back. My main is a prot pally and I really cant see any nerfs at all to instance groups making sense. My opinion is that tanks should probably do more threat and less damage. The fact that tanks aoe constantly puts them ahead of a lot of the DPS. Heroics would still be challenging if all a tank had to do was hit a mob once and keep threat forever tbh. If you dont CC the healer cant keep up with the dmg anyway. Even when you do CC the healer still has to spam heals because ill be getting hit for 30k by 2 mobs and the healer just doesnt have a 70k+ heal. Im usually around 140k hp and healers just cant fill that back up quickly. GC sounded to me like he wanted to put a &quot;Threat for Dummies&quot; guide into the game or something. I dont know how to make it much clearer than a screen flash with sounds and &quot;HIGH THREAT/ATTACKING YOU&quot; in big letters on your screen.</div></div><hr />

It is like four different development teams implemented taunts. By working like Paladin taunts I am referring to how Righteous Defense works, it requires you to target either the mob or who they are attacking. This makes it easy to use in a crowded area; like when walls tend to cut off PoV depending on your orientation; whereas the other taunts all require that you target the specific mob. <br />
<br />
In other words, make the tools we have more consistent between classes and easier to use. I am not looking for a similar taunt between classes though they have them, I just want them to work through the interface the same way. Target either the mob or its target and the taunt should work.</div></div><hr />

When TC is on cd or mobs are stun immune, you run around and do circles like if you were on drugs. You can hardly avoid hits in the back. And if then a boss decides to make a cone attack (3rd boss shadowfang for example), the drama begins.<br />
Threat is no prob at all. Marking skull for 1st tgt and you don't even have to cc (except of some cases of course)<br />
Using surv cds at the right time is not a problem. If you tried 1 or 2 times an encounter, you will know when its time for o-shit-buttons.<br />
Positioning and mob movement is an issue. But i don't whine about, i have to handle it and thatsfore i am tank.<br />
As far as i experienced cata heroics so far, saving healer's mana is the real challenge. Interrupt, whatever is interruptable and avoid the void-zones.</div></div><hr />

Oh, yay we have a needle and a little percentage number by the enemy portrait, that tells me so much! I know that an easy fix is to just use omen threat meters and I do, but I know hundreds of players who play this game with no addons what so ever. Dealing with paladin after paladin after countless paladin that didn't have pally power and would let like 1/4 to 1/2 of the raid go without blessings because he had no addons. I've met some really good players that don't believe in addons too(one of them was able to get to a 2300 rating with no addons. I salute him). Its a player choice and they can't just assume we all use addons and have omen as one of those addons. The in game threat indicator is really piss poor and really doesn't tell us much. I didn't mind back in vanilla wow because the standard blizzard ui was very bare and they had a lot of work to do and the treat meters back then were actually pretty good and accurate. I didn't mind back in BC because again, the standard ui was very bare and they had other stuff to do (though I really hated the times when omen and the other threat meters broke from patches and they wouldn't get fixed for weeks). I didn't mind in wotlk because threat wasn't an issue. Now in cata they have added a lot to the standard interface and they really have no excuse. They need to add a detailed threat watcher to the standard interface if they really want threat to be an incredibly important factor in PvE.</div></div><hr />

Using your D&amp;D example, healers and other squishies were positioned at the back of the party so there was a reduced chance they take damage. The concept being that the high HP classes took the brunt of the damage. The 3 roles in WoW are fine.<br />
<br />
Clerics had d8s for hit dice, wore the 2nd best armor category, wielded melee weapons, and could even use shields. So not only were they anything BUT squishy, but they couldn't hit anything in not on the front lines.<br />
<br />
Of course, warriors are supposed to take more hits. But that doesn't mean a mage should take NO hits. And that's all WoW is made of -- any non-tank can be 2-shotted, even 1-shotted by a boss. What's so bad about 50% of the boss' swings hitting the tanks and the other 50% spread out amongst the other raid members? Why is it all or nothing, all the time?<br />

Threat is stupid. No intelligent combatant behaves that way. We should expect more from our gaming experience.</div></div><hr />
