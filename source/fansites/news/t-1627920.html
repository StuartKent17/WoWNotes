This decade-spanning archive explores the history of WoW with the people who create it, collects stories from players around the world, and takes you into corners of Blizzard and the WoW community youâ€™ve never seen before.</div></div><hr />

Uh all blizz people still work at blizzard (shown in documentary) except Rob Pardo....also without that &quot;observation&quot; room there would be alot of server crashing,bugs,lag etc. How is it in any way an invasion of player privacy? they are monitoring how many people log into what server and when,and react to huge surges of activity,reacting to DDoS attacks etc. Stop making shit up please....<br />
<br />
OT- Loved the documentary,brought some nostalgia and memories,amazing piece of WoW history!</div></div><hr />

<br />
How else is Blizzard going to monitor 1 of the largest (game)server infrastructures in the world? <br />
<br />
Real-time monitoring of where people are logging in, to what server, are there any attacks(DDOS) or simple errors between the server and the player client.<br />
<br />
Also how is it invasion of player privacy? Blizzard is known to monitor stuff which 99% surely IS mentioned in the little text called &quot;Terms of Service&quot; you so blindly accepted without reading it.</div></div><hr />

Y'know how one of the Cata raids can net you the (temporary) title &quot;Slayer of Stupid, Incompetent, and Disappointing Minions&quot;?<br />
<br />
People like you describe should get that title permanently, minus the &quot;Slayer of&quot; and &quot;Minions&quot; part, and be unable to remove it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
eu takes raid testing WAY more seriously, and tbf the raid testing was really fucking bad. soooo many delays/bugs/untested encounters (like internally untested).<br />
<br />
but ion is just the best guy ever. you can't not love him, he's just awesome</div></div><hr />

<br />
Showing some of the cons was cool too, as someone who has never gone it's crazy to see how many people dress up and shit, so many people are so into it. Makes me think WoW will never die.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it takes a lot of dailies. They're also incredibly easy dailies that are several expansions old. It's not that difficult for even the most casual player to get that mount so long as they do a few argent tourney quests over a long enough period of time.</div></div><hr />

I'd like a Unicorn. Don't play Alliance so can't use it and the zhevra doesn't really cut it. I'm not exactly casual. Also, it'd be interesting to see why Unicorns are &quot;fucking stupid&quot; in a fantasy game. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

48:02. <br />
<br />
Just watch it? If they're talking about how they feel going forward and talking about upcoming events...well, I struggle to consider that as &quot;the past&quot;.<br />

almost certainly the realms are clustered, and pulling a blade like that means he is confident in the fail over. assuming they were up, and he wasnt just trolling.</div></div><hr />

Hell yes! I definitely had a lot more fun in UO than EQ. Mostly 97/98 before the Notoriety &gt; Fame/Karma changes and Definitely Pre-Trammel. Nothing like hiding with a friend outside some assholes tower waiting for him to recall in, stealing his keys, making copies and going into town to get random people to essentially be mercenaries to keep him and his friends at bay by letting them take whatever they can grab while ya loot the place clean. :)</div></div><hr />

I asked myself similar question midway through the film. And I gave myself an answer: Because those passionate, dedicated people did many things I disliked in passing years.<br />
And as a passionate and dedicated player, I feel my feedback is worth something for them.<br />
I don't get nerdrage for being nerfed by a patch, or losing this or that skill due to fat trimming or &quot;making game fun&quot;.<br />
I don't care about small things like that. I will find optimal path to be best at my role I can be.<br />
<br />
I get disillusioned and frustrated because I disagree with general direction game is going. And this frustration comes from love to the game. Anger is born from being powerless - and lets face it, we can't change the world (... of warcraft) - to protect what I care so much about.<br />
<br />
This film - while it was great to watch and hits all the soft places in geek's heart - is a PR-piece. Word 'Documentary' feels wrong, when applied to this.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, Chris Metzen would be first on my Zombie Apocalypse team. <br />
I geek out about WoD as much as any fanboy. I deeply care for games those guys made over the years.<br />
And that is why I am pissed off at Blizzard, and I will remain pissed off - because I don't think their choices benefit WoW as a game, as a community and as a franchise.<br />
But you know what? I might be wrong. <br />
I'd love to be wrong! Because if I'm wrong on this - their game will be better.<br />
And don't we all want that at the end?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, I ain't gonna lie, I had to choke back tears a few times as well.<br />
<br />
It's really hard not to get caught up in the emotion of folks like Metzen and Didier. <br />
<br />
When Platner shared the bit about watching the sun rise in the game with his wife, I lost it. <br />
<br />
Is this a PR piece? Maybe. But those guys are geeks and nerds like us, and while I may not trust the suits in charge of everything, I think the blizzard folks that appeared in the documentary are being honest about their motivations and desires. I really do think these guys care about making games people will honestly want to play. <br />
<br />
I mean when Metzen is sitting there saying 'Will they like it? Will they come and play with us?&quot;, I think that's right from the heart. <br />
<br />
It honestly wasn't until I sat and watched this that I realized how important Blizzard has been in my life. I remember having to work out phone schedules so a few folks I met from my BBS days and I could sit play Warcraft, and later, Warcraft 2 (No TCP/IP networking back in those days!). I remember our geek get togethers where we all hauled our systems over to a friends house for a weekend (because, you know, gaming laptops didn't exist back in those days), so we could have massive Warcraft 3 LAN parties. Alot of those friends went into Everquest with me when it came out, and then we all moved to World of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
Even today, I make new acquaintances and friends just because WoW somehow gets mentioned, and there's an instant kinship based on common interest, especially if it turns out that they're Horde players as well. <br />
<br />
My wife and I didn't meet because of WoW, but we shared similar interests (we met at DragonCon). She's a noob, probably always will be. One of those filthy casuals that I used to complain about. But I have a character that I only play with her. Now that our kids are getting old enough to actually play WoW, I have characters that I only play with them. We don't play in a group, so playing WoW with the kids and the wife is a one on one spending time with each other thing, because we spend time as a family pretty much all the time. Guiding them through and watching them get excited about content that I'd been done with years ago has been refreshing and some of the most fun I've had playing WoW. It's a little surreal when you're on a long car drive and the conversation from behind is something like your daughter (the middle child) educating our eldest on how he's playing his hunter wrong (she's right, he is), or how cool the pirate ship in the Deadmines is, or how they don't like Garrosh because he's mean and scares them. My eyes are of the old and cynical raider who's done the grind far far too many times. But seeing it through their eyes... reminds me of why I love the game in the first place. <br />
<br />
For all the mistakes Blizzard may have made, WoW and Blizzard games in general have been a pretty positive thing in my life. For that, I'm willing to extend them alot of grace and patience to give them the opportunity to fix their mistakes, and I feel that, for the most part, they have. They've been a major contributor as to why this heavily introverted alpha geek has been able to avoid the pitfall of having retarded social skills by allowing him to interact with other people of similar interests in a more or less safe (and fun) environment. <br />
<br />
For the Horde, brothers and sisters!<br />

I mean for Cata, sure Deathwing was an underdeveloped and static villain, the introduction of LFR was a bad idea in my opinion, the removal of all locks aside from random box drops made my rogue feel useless, the power creep made pvp a numbers game, leveling became trivial, I hated that Night Elves got the shaft pretty much everywhere from the Horde, Malfurion was overshadowed by Thrall, being tricked into attending Thrall's wedding (I prided myself in killing him for the Black Bear mount prior to that), and actually I just never liked anything Thrall in that expansion............ Still, I would have gushed about Vanessa VanCleef, that Demon Hunter easter egg, and the Rogue Legendary Dagger quest!</div></div><hr />

You can see in this movie that the guy is just a nerd at heart who wants to make awesome games that he and other people want to play. Sorry Chris, and thanks to you and all of the other developers/artists/everybody at Blizzard who makes WoW happen, I can't imagine life without this game, and I absolutely can't wait til Thursday!</div></div><hr />

That whole argument of &quot;It will cost you a raid tier&quot; - um if you could make MC in a week, why don't we have more raids again?<br />
<br />
I loved the documentary. It was pretty cool to see where the game came from.<br />
<br />
molten core was extremely simple compared to nowadays raids, the environment is just a cave and most of the mobs inside are just the same you can see outside but on steroids; ill bet that just doing the garrosh fight alone had taken them more than a week and probably 2 month to build all the rest and if a raid like molten core so simple and plain looking will be released today the sheer amount of rage will be unbearable.</div></div><hr />

It was brilliant. I think they found just the right balance really and it could probably have gone on easily for another hour. Some quite emotional moments too.. Chris Metzen in particular just seems to get the feels going.</div></div><hr />

All the memories and experiences that we have all shared in this time is amazing and I can only hope that Blizzard continues to craft this game with the same love and soul that they have clearly poured into it already. I won't lie, some tears did come to my eyes from time-to-time whilst watching this - really very touching.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaldriss</div><div class="date">2014-11-09, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That was like watching a graceful falcon flying through the air only to smack into a window with a bloody smear of guts and bile. Sadly half those guys don't even work at Blizz anymore and a lot of the stuff they claimed was really sketchy and reeked of revisionism.<br />
<br />
And was anyone else REALLY creeped out by the observation room? That's straight up NSA behavior and a total invasion of player privacy. Who knows where Blizz sells their info.<br />
<br />
youre trying too hard buddy</div></div><hr />

I generally love all kinds of behind-the-scenes-stuff. I love seeing the artists with their multiple screens and tablets, watching interviews with the composers, hear the designers talk about stuff, seeing the spaces where the people work and all that. It's inspiring. It's also nice to see all these different walks of people, all those players and how they share a common enthusiasm.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Quite frankly, I'm embarrassed. This being the primary game I grew up with, I've taken it more seriously than one should take a video game. Glad they made this doc, it was illuminating.<br />
<br />
i kinda agree, to an extent. i mean, our anger comes from being passionate about the game as well. it's out of concern for the game that we sometimes lose our cool, so i think it's understandable.<br />
<br />
anyway, it was a great movie. i love it when i can hear some history about my favorite subject ever.</div></div><hr />

It also made me wish I could be a part of this company that has so much love for what they do.<br />
<br />
I also hope it helps show people that Blizzard does care about their game, not just for money. Glad Blizz made it, made me appreciate them so much more.</div></div><hr />

Only interesting part was seeing server rooms IMO (lol) I just can't get into it emotionally. I've played this game since spring 2006 but could not feel ANY connection to players that were shown/talking. <br />
<br />
I did not find any depth either, it was just your average &quot;lol then we made cataclysm&quot; and you see some fast footage how Darkshore was changed. (in fact it made me think that darkshore was cata-upgraded first and then rest zones were rushed, just like new models, dwarves are good and rest are rushed etc.).<br />
<br />
Overall: MEH!</div></div><hr />

i am a dad of 2 kids, me and my wife met because of an mmo just before wow, we played wow too for years, i still do, i have and still make fun and good memories inside this game too, along in rl ofc :P. After doing raiding for the whole MoP, at almost hardcore level, i have to admit , real life, work, family made me play wow tired...But after this documentary, i remembered so many good times in the game, so many friends i made, hell with some we even met up close. i am from Greece and we met with friends from Norway and Holland and from balkans, i will play the next expansion, just for the friends, even if i have to stop sleeping hahaï»¿</div></div><hr />
