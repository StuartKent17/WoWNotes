you cannot use the phone app and be on the character/game at the same time if that's what you're attempting. I've had no issues on the galaxy s7.</div></div><hr />

You can have multiple authenticators. Download the authenticator app for your Android device and set it up.<br />
<br />
WoW Armory and the WoW Legion Companion apps can both import your authentication code automatically if you have it installed on the same device.<br />
<br />
<br />
It works fine on my tablet. Pretty barebones compared to the in-game interface, but it's functional and does everything as advertised. I feel like it could maybe use a little ambient music, since it's a bit stark with just the UI sound effects clinking and clanging.</div></div><hr />

Pardon me why I roll my eyes. In reality, the majority of computer users would benefit from the simplicity of an apple computer. It's a great (and very expensive) platform to check email and play interwebs. Gaming has been king on the PC for years. That isn't going to change probably ever.<br />

iOS vs android is personal preference. The vast majority of aviation related things are only found on an iOS. It's all I can use at work, but I use both iPhones and android phones for cellular service (domestic vs project fi international). Both are great platforms.<br />

That's a stupid remark. Any high end Android device costs just as much as iPhone devices. Paid €750 for my M9, which was at the time just as much as the IP6<br />

Android is only shitty for those that don't know how to fully utilize it. S-off, rooting and a custom rom brings wonders to it that are never possible on a jailbroken iOS device. I've had both types of devices and don't like at all how much handholding is happening on IOs compared to Android.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I enjoy aspects of both sides. Android due to the openiness, iOS due to the ease. Windows for gaming, Mac for programming. I work at a software company, and our developers too tend to program on apple devices. They each have their part, and I used to be heavily anti-apple anything, but now I enjoy both and just go based off preference of what I need.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The reason why Android has that statistic is because Android is running on way more phones than iOS.<br />
<br />
iOS only runs on Apple devices. Android runs on just about everything else. You can go down to Walmart and buy a $20 burner phone and it will probably have an Android OS on it.</div></div><hr />

Eh. I'm not in the habit of overpaying for products, even if I can afford them. With Apple you're really paying for the brand name, not the quality of the device.</div></div><hr />

Not US here, but it wasn't in my app store, I had to click the link on the webpage to get it to show. <br />

It is on the US and AU stores, it is how ever not currently available via search.<br />
<br />
1. Open safari on your device<br />
2. Surf to MMO-C<br />
3. Click on the IOS link.<br />
4. It will ask you to open in App store<br />
5. Say yes.</div></div><hr />

It works exactly as advertised. I had 40/50 mission items when I logged out last night. Logged into the app, completed the final mission. When I logged back into the game the quest was completed and ready to be turned in.</div></div><hr />

You can have multiple authenticators. Download the authenticator app for your Android device and set it up.<br />

Now find out the average - divide the Apple quantity by around 10 (versions) and then the Android quantity by around 20,000 (versions).<br />
<br />
A valid comparison:<br />

<br />
(P.S. I have my authenticator on my phone as well. When the app advised that it needed my code I got a notification at the top of my screen that a request to the authenticator had come in and I could hit &quot;Accept&quot; in the little notification area without actually having to switch over to the authenticator and back again. So maybe if you're having issues switching back and forth make sure your notifications are turned on.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am a user. I don't give a shit WHY something doesn't work.<br />
There shouldn't be any harsh 3D animation work involved. No reason why my phone should not be able to handle it.<br />
<br />
Spoken like someone who has never programmed an Android App or any other phone app.<br />
<br />
You know what would be great? All Android phones being on the same version of Android. Next, even if all Android phones were on the same version, the behavior between phones can be different. In the end, a lot of developers opt for maximum capability and skip over functions, algorithms, and features available in new versions. Android is a great platform, but it's got its problems. <br />
<br />
Also, unlike Apple, you don't know the underlying performance capabilities of an Android phone. Joe Bob in the Northwest Territories could literally hack together a cell phone platform, license the Android OS, and slap it on a machine that can't handle it. Apple takes care of this by having a minimum of variables.<br />
<br />
For your S5 problems, Blizzard went to route of maximum compatibility at the expense of using nice new functions older phones may not be able to handle. The question for you to answer is this: would you rather have the app now in a performance hogging way, or in 6 months with less performance issues as they tweak the code to take advantage of newer methods on more recent phones? You can have one.<br />
<br />
Apple and Android have their pluses and minuses. For Apple you get everything walled in very nicely. It's easy (once you nail OBJ-C or swift) to know how your app will perform across a wide range of phones. For Android you get tons of flexibility, but with that comes the wild west of providers and phones. Often you find yourself meeting at the lowest common denominator.</div></div><hr />

Hmm, it can only run kitkat at best? Sad to say for sure but there may be something in the SDK for lollipop that makes the program miserable to run on kitkat. Also, being bitter about something that isn't even part of what is promised with the purchase of the product is really entitled. I understand being sad about it not working with your phone, but it is what it is. I guess blame someone if it makes you feel better, but it will change nothing nor will anyone be sympathetic to it. And if it doesn't make you feel better... then you are really confused as to how to spend your time.</div></div><hr />

Not quite sure what you are complaining about. The app is showing you the world quests, which you know you have not unlocked. But you decided to go to that spot on your character that you know can't do them and it isn't there, and you are annoyed?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh I see. Well, I guess, that part of the app might be garbage. but being able to send your followers out from anywhere certainly isn't. Sorry it is so upsetting to you the world quest tab is buggy. <br />
<br />
I misunderstood earlier. It seemed like you were not even 110, going to where the app told you a world quest was, and then there wasn't. Because there wouldn't be if you hadn't unlocked them yet. So my bad in that sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On point, I’m hopeful that they fix the login mechanism. Currently any time I close the app, when I go back into it I have to manually enter my login/pw, and then go to my authenticator app and click approve, then come back to this app and log in. What a PITA. I don’t understand why it doesn’t work the way the Armory app works, given that they are both made by Blizzard and the Amory app is way easier to use.<br />
<br />
As far as the functionality of the app once you do log in, I like it! I’m surprised they changed their minds about letting us do missions and other things like that while not actually in the game, but I for one am happy to see it.<br />
<br />
And for the people complaining about the world quests (possibly) being inaccurate, who the F cares? You have to log in to do them anyway, so check your map at that point. Lol. Quit yer bitchin! ™</div></div><hr />

I'm not bitter. Mildly annoyed because I actually looked forward to being able to handle garrison crap, w/o having to log in but oh well. <br />
It's not as if the application does anything that is vital.<br />

Maybe that's why it's a completly optional feature that doesn't really add anything new other than being able to do a few things you can already do in-game just on a different platform? ...maybe?</div></div><hr />

I don't think this is going to be a thing. I can remember the most recent journey down this path: TLS 1.0. Google could have updated their security suites on older phones, but they opted not to. Nothing like a 'Cannot connect' to drive people to a newer platform.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bet it's a lot of fun to tinker, but I prefer for my smartphone to &quot;just work&quot; as I am not a smartphone aficionado.<br />
<br />
A big reason I play Blizzard games is because of the dual compatibility with windows and mac on their games. That being said I have used apple products on and off since 2002. A big reason was they &quot;just work&quot; which back then being illiterate in both and nothing but virus after virus on my PCs was a huge benefit to the switch.<br />
<br />
These days though, the &quot;it just works&quot; shtick is a little dated. They don't &quot;just work&quot; in fact they have just as many updates as windows does and just as many problems. Same with the phones. They have just as many problems and their own unfixable/ignored nuances.<br />
<br />
I find it incredibly annoying that each and every OS update comes with unnecessary changes to the UI in iTunes both on the phone and computer. The placement of the headphone jack, power button, power plug.<br />
<br />
It would be like rearranging the keyboard every time a new laptop comes around. Yes there is a scientifically proven more efficient configuration for the keyboard... IF you have never used a keyboard. But because it is so disruptive to existing users, we don't use it.<br />
<br />
Apple hasn't really been all that innovative for several years now. They aren't a driving force in technology and the release of new features on new products is actually a little behind the 8 ball.<br />
<br />
I think the only thing I have found is they have the cheapest in price PCIe SSD configuration for a while... if you really need that bottleneck opened up. (for that specific component... because you still have to purchase a Mac Pro to utilize it)<br />
<br />
I find myself sticking with it for the sake of familiarity. (for the things that don't change) Which admittedly is a bad reason for any decision.</div></div><hr />

When I logged back on my character a few minutes later, the progress had reset to 1/10 shards instead of the 9/10 it should have been at. 4 days 10h estimated for a ticket answer. Guess I won't have the third relic slot on my weapon anytime soon... Don't use the app for any campaign quest :/</div></div><hr />

Keep this on track, we are discussing the app. No one cares which phone is used more, it's not relevant, the developement is done. And that goes for the rest of you too, just talk about the app or some bans are going to be issued.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, okay..guess it is the programmers fault. Then again - shoot me for being old fashioned: Programms today still run on windows XP and I honestly believe we are littering the world already to a crazy extend - as long as my phone works (and it is indeed also still free of scratches and nothing broken), why should I throw it away and buy a new one.<br />

Yeah, I guess for some people it works...they would buy a new iphone because on their old they couldn't play Pokemon Go. Baffling to me. Should have bought Apple Stock in 1995 ^^</div></div><hr />

Also the one MOST important feature once you have completed your Class Campaign is missing: No way to manage Artifact Research. In cases where you can't access the game proper for a number of days, you will fall behind on Research. Orders take 4 days to complete and you can only have 2 queued up at a time, so worst case if you have an order popping just before you go on a trip longer than 4 days you will start to fall behind. I was going to bring my Surface with me anyway, but it is an odd decision, considering you can manage Order Hall Talents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yesterday I installed the new application on an iPhone 4 which has software version 7.1.2 (the latest) also installed. Here's what's happening:<br />
<br />
1: The Legion app installs and downloads - maybe an update?<br />
2: I select the EU region and the app restarts<br />
3: Click the 'login' button<br />
4: The green eye shows with the word 'connecting'<br />
<br />
Nothing else happens. The app stays like this. I left it like this for almost half an hour last night and this morning. No change.<br />
<br />
The iPhone 4 also has the wow authenticator app installed on it, but the Legion app isn't showing any message to enter a code - if one is required to use the Legion app? <br />
<br />
I'm not sure if this is because the traffic on the app is very busy at the moment or another issue? I'm also aware the iPhone 4 isn't the latest device out there, but the app store tells me the Legion app is supported for my device.<br />
<br />
I've tried reinstalling the app a few times and restarting the device. This isn't fixing the issue.<br />
<br />
Has anyone else got this issue? Did you manage to get the app working?<br />
<br />
Help?<br />
<br />
Many thanks</div></div><hr />

I've selected the region that I play in, which is EU. Still the same issue sadly. I know the iPhone 4 is an older device now, but it would be a shame if the app won't work on it. I was looking forward to using it.</div></div><hr />

Nice ad hominem there bud, but what does that have to do with anything? Stop waving your&quot;look how much money I've spent on my machine&quot; e-peen around and come back with an actual argument.<br />
<br />
Don't give me that, I know how the IT sector works, Macs are not terribly prevalent, or desired in most areas, or are you /actually/ arguing that Macs have access to all the advanced features of Linux? or that they have a prevalent use in high level IT fields? Never mind that Macs by their very design are inflexible and closed source, which is the anti-thesis of being a power user.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">teddabear</div><div class="date">2016-09-11, 12:21 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's simple. Macs are more trouble free and you can access Linux at will. Good paying IT jobs require fairly frequent use of <br />
Linux. Most of the virtualization solutions that aren't Hyper-V use Linux. Most storage solutions utilize Linux. Apps that include a built in web server always use Apache. People with those jobs don't have the time or inclination to mess around with some barely useful app that takes a lot of tweaking. When they are at work they are working and when they aren't they are doing something truly relaxing. Even if it's mindlessly killing mobs in WoW for an hour while they de-stress. Personally I have 10 PCs and 3 Macs because I am heavily focused on Windows Server but IT people with similar experience who's focus is with a different vendor always use Macs. <br />
<br />
Your mistake was focusing on what companies buy for their peons instead of what the experts use.</div></div><hr />
