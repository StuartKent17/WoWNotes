We’ve been thrilled to see how positively players have responded to Mythic Keystone dungeons since Legion’s release. However, there are a couple areas in which our original design for the system hasn’t quite matched up with how things have worked out in practice. In an upcoming 7.2.5 PTR build, we’re going to try out a couple of changes to how Keystone runs work.<br />
<br />
The first big change is that we’re getting rid of the depletion mechanic. We’d originally imagined that getting ahold of a Keystone would be more of a barrier than it is, but in reality, there are so many players participating that it’s generally not too difficult to find someone with a Keystone you’d like to run. In that environment, depleting a Keystone is more of an annoyance than anything else – especially when it happens for reasons outside of your control (such as a player disconnecting).<br />
<br />
Instead, we’re going to try the following:<br />
<br />
Completing the run on time will have the same results it currently does in 7.2: you’ll get a new Keystone for a random dungeon that’s 1-3 levels higher than the one you just completed, based on how quickly you finished. If you complete the dungeon but don’t make the timer, you’ll get a Keystone for a random dungeon that’s 1 level lower than the one you just used. If you don’t complete the dungeon at all, you’ll have a Keystone for the same dungeon that’s one level lower than the one you just used.<br />
<br />
The other thing we’re looking to change is the way that rewards are given at the end of a run. Currently, when you complete a run that upgrades your Keystone by 2 or 3 levels, you’re also given a 2nd or 3rd chest. This is because, when we believed that Keystones would be rare, we didn’t want you to miss out on any of the loot you might have collected from the runs you were “skipping.”<br />
<br />
However, because of this, players tend to look for lower-level Keystones that they can easily stomp through, instead of higher-level Keystones that are appropriately challenging for their gear and skill. That, in turn, affects who they’re willing to invite. AOE damage output is preferred over everything else, because the only concern is how quickly you can clear through easy trash packs. And gear requirements tend to outpace what actually drops: if you could find upgrades in a Mythic 6, you’ll have a hard time finding a group, because the Mythic 6 groups are full of players who are capable of clearing 10+ and are just looking for an easy 3-chest.<br />
<br />
With that in mind, here’s the changes we’re planning to test:<br />
<br />
You no longer receive additional chests at the end of a run for completing it quickly. When you finish a Mythic+ dungeon, the chest at the end will contain two items and an appropriate amount of Artifact Power. If you beat the timer, regardless of how quickly, there will be a third item in the chest. Keystones can still upgrade by 2 or 3 steps, so you can quickly get to a difficulty level appropriate for you.<br />
<br />
Our overall goal with these changes is to incentivize groups to take on dungeons where they know they’re likely to see upgrades, instead of preferring keys that are far too easy for them. Once the Tomb of Sargeras raid is available on Mythic difficulty, we’ll also increase the maximum rewards from Mythic Keystone runs to level 15.</div></div><hr />

What lol. Because you can't deplete the key anymore your entire issue doesn't exist. You do the +2, go in, do that run, get the loot from that, get higher? k do that, fail? well it's 1 key lower, try that. <br />
<br />
You'll always have runs to do, you won't &quot;Lose out on loot&quot;<br />

So for putting in more effort AKA getting 3 chests you now get less loot, so the incentive is to just take it slooooww and 1 chest every key now to get max amount of loot? brilliant designing right here.<br />
<br />
Doing keys fast won't get you less loot, you aren't losing loot. Time is the currency in this situation, not your key, because your key can't deplete now.</div></div><hr />

Do what? I don't see anything in there saying you can't finish it fast still. Just that if you finish it fast you don't get extra loot because you over geared it basically. If anything it'll encourage people to run Mythic +'s on par with their gear level. Also, if you finish a keystone fast you are rewarded with the extra time to do another one or get on with something else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To maximize loot though you'll want to do a +2 (3 pieces), +3 (6 pieces), +4 (9 Pieces), +5 (12 pieces)<br />
<br />
If you go fast you'll get +2(3 pieces), +5(6 pieces) and on top of that you miss out on chests for legendaries and BLP<br />
<br />
+2-+5 slow is 4 chests<br />
<br />
+2-+5 fast is 2 chests<br />
<br />
+2-+5 in 7.2 fast is 6 chests, unless they up the drop rate significantly for legendaries from M+ is a loss that way too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the loot, I don't see how this would change people running lower keys? CoS/Upper Kara get farmed because you can do up to +9 in under 15 mins quite easily. Unless there is a serious upgrade in AP drops I still see lower keys being used by higher geared players, just because people are more interested in their ap/hour than the difficulty really, and also there tends to be an abundance of 4-9 keys, once you get above 10 you start to lose people who can't be bothered with the extra affix.<br />
<br />
Also, is it just me or was the whole point of m+ to challenge yourself to go as quick as possible with your lower keys? Thats certainly how I thought it was supposed to work. Maybe it wasn't their design ideas but feels like they are fixing something that doesn't need fixing.</div></div><hr />

Wtf are you talking about. People don't have unlimitted time. <br />
<br />
If you have time, to do 9 dungeons in a sitting, do those 8 dungeons, so if you do a 2, then a 5, 8, 10, 12, 13, 12, 11, 12 (including if you failed a few there) you get loot from all those dungeons in your time, and skipped keys to get up to better loot, you lost nothing, because you did what you had time to do.<br />
<br />
Keys are not limitted anymore, time is, so time is the thing of value here, not keys. Understand?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Doomchicken</div><div class="date">2017-05-03, 02:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting changes. Definitely a positive no longer having depleted keystones. It felt really shit losing out on your keystone because of a power outage or internet outage, which while rare has happened to me a few times.<br />
<br />
Not so sure on the loot thing though. I can see it being a positive on the higher keystone levels where you're going to be boosting your keystone by 1 as it's basically free loot. It does kind of suck for those who are currently able to triple chest 10-15s though as that equals 3 less pieces of loot total.</div></div><hr />

+13? deplete 3 times - you just got a easier key for the same loot<br />
????</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">darkwarrior42</div><div class="date">2017-05-03, 02:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">To maximize loot though you'll want to do a +2 (3 pieces), +3 (6 pieces), +4 (9 Pieces), +5 (12 pieces)<br />

<br />
If you're only looking at the number of chests for a given range of difficulties, you are correct. <br />
<br />
However, the reality would be more akin to the following: <br />
<br />
Player A does +2 slowly, +3 slowly, +4 slowly, +5 slowly, gets 12 pieces of lower level gear. <br />
Player B does +2 quickly, does +5 quickly, moves on to +8 or higher while Player A is still working his way through lower level dungeons, gets higher level loot. <br />
<br />
And say Player B gets to +8 and fails to beat the timer... he gets 2 pieces of +8 gear (more valuable than 3 pieces of +5 gear), and now has a +7 keystone to do. Either he beats that and gets 3 pieces of gear and a +8 keystone, or he fails that one and gets 2 pieces of +7 gear (still more valuable than 3 pieces of +5 gear) and drops down to a +6 keystone. <br />
<br />
Your model is only more lucrative if both of the following hold true: <br />
-More pieces of loot are better than higher level loot (possible with lucky titanforges, but unlikely)<br />
-Nobody cares about time spent (impossible given how WoW players approach the game)</div></div><hr />

It's pretty clear Blizzard doesn't like players asking for 30 ilvl higher than what drops from the dungeons.<br />
<br />
I don't think that this will even lower M+ participation either but rather increase it now that keys can't be depleted and you can just run as many you want per week without having to find other peoples keys. This means people can actually just make groups instead of getting 24/7 declined from every group.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc7a136ec19d</div><div class="date">2017-05-03, 02:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they're making it even better to do Mythic+ over raids to get gear.<br />
<br />
Now, with these changes, if you deplete a key you still get TWO pieces of gear. If you get it in time which isn't very hard to do you get three pieces. <br />
<br />
Let's say you were gearing up now, you could deplete a +10, get two pieces of gear. Run the +9 that you get given for depleting and get 3 pieces of gear then run the +10/11/12 key you get and deplete it for 2 pieces of gear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onikaroshi</div><div class="date">2017-05-03, 02:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Wtf are you talking about. People don't have unlimitted time. <br />

<br />
Keys are not limitted anymore, time is, so time is the thing of value here, not keys. Understand?<br />
<br />
if you have time to do 9 dungeons now you get 27 chests at 2 items a piece, so 52 items.<br />
<br />
if you do 9 dungeons in 7.2.5 with the changes thats 9 chests with 3 items a piece so 27 items total.<br />
<br />
plus thats 18 chests less for legendaries so they would need to up the drop rate from M+<br />
<br />
the new way is way less items total, no ifs ands or buts.<br />
<br />
Very few people do these things to push, they do them to three chest and be done with it, the people who push, will still push in the new system, but this hurts people who do M+ for gear.<br />
<br />
They can keep the no depletion, that's cool, but the 1 chest thing is retarded and needs to go.</div></div><hr />

????<br />
<br />
The AP is definitely nice, but you're right in that if &quot;depleting&quot; a key works the same as it does now, if I do an Arcway+10, and get a BRH+13, I can go into BRH, quickly deplete it 3 times, and have a +10 ready in like 2minutes, for my group to continue farming gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
reducing change at lego by 2/3 (really the only reason other than AP we do carries)<br />
<br />
For us time is the commodity. The way these changes are, we will likely stop carrying pug keys and almost exclusively do 5/5 player guild keys. Which is a big blow to the casual players who look for these carries each week for the weekly chest.</div></div><hr />

Your argument was that people would do runs slower so their key didn't go up, don't change it now lmfao. <br />
<br />
But again, people are assuming it's 2-3 items split among a group of 5, rather than 2-3 each person (The system in place in beta, up until a few weeks before launch) <br />
<br />
We don't actually know yet, because it was worded terribly.</div></div><hr />

keys can not deplete anymore, if you're not in time, you can redo it in 1 lower difficulty. (3 items when in time, 2 when not)<br />

This just screws over a lot of casuals ... think at the start of the expansion they stated they want better geared people have at least some kind of incentive to play with lesser geared randoms (about runes and tf gear in lfr) and something along those lines for m+ dungeons too<br />

Nah just do the run normally and deplete a key if it's higher than 10 till its back down to 10 (or desired level)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onikaroshi</div><div class="date">2017-05-03, 02:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">keys can not deplete anymore, if you're not in time, you can redo it in 1 lower difficulty. (3 items when in time, 2 when not)<br />
<br />
So go ahead and farm your lower levels in stead of pushing as hard as you can and get more and better stuff for the same time investment.<br />
<br />
it caps at 10, why push higher? right now if you +3 a 10 key you get 3 chests and you can do that 5 times in your group for a quick 15 chests and 30 items.<br />
<br />
the new way means you get 5 chests in the same amount of time and effort, with 15 pieces of loot total.<br />
<br />
even if you want to maximize gear at the highest level it still kills the amount of drops</div></div><hr />

+13? deplete 3 times - you just got a easier key for the same loot<br />
????<br />
<br />
Is the bonus AP a joke though? Got 19 million AP last week in the chest (at AK level 31 at the time) for doing a +20 the week prior. I don't know, seems like a pretty good incentive to me to try and do some higher ones. Also keep in mind that the bonus AP will scale up to +30<br />
<br />
As for the loot yeah its a nerf for lower keys, but once you got up to the higher ones right now you could only +1 with the occasional +2 anyway, this will actually give you 1 more piece of loot at the very high levels than is the case right now maybe offering some extra incentive to actually do higher keys outside the bonus AP at both the end of the run and the weekly cache.</div></div><hr />

Sure but you will only do one high key unless you care about m+ score - and get less loot along the way compared to now (per time spent doing keys)<br />
and if you did +20 you surely at least 2chested up to about 18 - these changes will get you less loot once they are in</div></div><hr />

You realise, that wording you quoted, was the wording they used to describe it in beta when each person got two items right? <br />

<br />
Last thing we want is for these people to always be carried in the current welfare system.<br />
<br />
One player wants to be carried and four other players want to carry the previously mentioned one because he is letting them make use of his key. Perhaps it is the last thing you want, but it is not the last thing that thousands upon thousands want. Sometimes you have to think about the possibility that the thing that you want is also not something the vast majority wants.<br />

You're literally talking about preventing a group of five people from getting together in a game and playing it out they wish to. The result? Most casuals will give up on the system entirely and they'll be totaly alienated from the good ones.</div></div><hr />

Stop saying 2, it's 3. You can't compare a 3 chest run to a failed run. <br />

It's a 50% loss. If you couldn't complete the run in time beforehand, it was a 2 item now vs a 2 item then.</div></div><hr />

Current system is 2 pieces of loot per chest for group<br />
<br />
so 3 chests means 6 pieces of loot randomly distributed among everyone in group.<br />

with system they're bringing up this would be 3 pieces of loot for entire group.... funzies eh?</div></div><hr />

<br />
reducing change at lego by 2/3 (really the only reason other than AP we do carries)<br />
<br />
For us time is the commodity. The way these changes are, we will likely stop carrying pug keys and almost exclusively do 5/5 player guild keys. Which is a big blow to the casual players who look for these carries each week for the weekly chest.<br />
<br />
I'm sure Blizzard never intended for &quot;carries&quot; to become so prevalent in the Mythic+ system so far. <br />
<br />
&quot;Casual&quot; players having their keys carried every week has two glaring downsides:<br />
<br />
- RNG plays a big factor on player progression - those with desirable keys luck out, whilst the unlucky ones will not complete a level they desire for that week. <br />
- Reliance on 'carries' breeds laziness and extends the skill gap between top caliber players with the &quot;casuals&quot;. The system is clearly designed so that players should gradually do harder dungeons as their skill/gear improves, but the prevalence of carries means that the &quot;casuals&quot; simply seeks the easy method of getting geared up without a parallel increase in their skill level. <br />
<br />
Of course, adding a financial incentive would still attract carriers and this will bring M+ in line with how raid carries currently work, which is absolutely fine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Casual&quot; players having their keys carried every week has two glaring downsides:<br />
<br />
- RNG plays a big factor on player progression - those with desirable keys luck out, whilst the unlucky ones will not complete a level they desire for that week. <br />
- Reliance on 'carries' breeds laziness and extends the skill gap between top caliber players with the &quot;casuals&quot;. The system is clearly designed so that players should gradually do harder dungeons as their skill/gear improves, but the prevalence of carries means that the &quot;casuals&quot; simply seeks the easy method of getting geared up without a parallel increase in their skill level. <br />
<br />
Of course, adding a financial incentive would still attract carriers and this will bring M+ in line with how raid carries currently work, which is absolutely fine.<br />
<br />
Regardless of blizzard's thoughts about carries (&quot;i.e. they probably couldn't give a shit&quot;) hurting the casual playerbase which is the majority of their income from wow is not a good move.</div></div><hr />

reducing change at lego by 2/3 (really the only reason other than AP we do carries)<br />
<br />
For us time is the commodity. The way these changes are, we will likely stop carrying pug keys and almost exclusively do 5/5 player guild keys. Which is a big blow to the casual players who look for these carries each week for the weekly chest.<br />
<br />
Good. That way the lower geared people can do low level keys together, carry their own weight, aim to just finish in time instead of having an incentive to get carried to 3-chest, and earn their reward - instead of getting carried to it.<br />

Much better situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Removing depleting keys so now people will be less antsy about &quot;what if key depletes&quot; and it will suck way less if someone dcs / drops group. <br />
<br />
2. Removing incentive to speed run, so there will be less emphasis on overgearing and specific fotm specs that are good at speedrunning. <br />
<br />
3. Removing the incentive to do the &quot;boost your key&quot; runs, the whole boosting culture is disgusting. <br />
<br />
What I feel is missing: <br />
<br />
Rewards to actually do &quot;challenging keys&quot;, they take more time to complete but past 15 in 7.2.5 won't reward much except extra AP which can be obtained faster from different sources anyway. Nerfing zerging easy dungeons is only half of the issue, another half is actually adding proper rewards to doing something riskier, time consuming and more difficult, because why bother if no reward? <br />
<br />
Maybe for example every 2 levels you can beat above the cap you get an extra item from the chest?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Stanislav</div><div class="date">2017-05-03, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">by the time this goes into the game the cap is 15, best thing to do is have 5 geared players spam the 15 in time, and reset the next key till its 15 and run it. when you hit a shit instance you move on to the next key in the group.<br />
<br />
boosting is still going to be there for the reason that you dont always got a good instance in your group so you pug a key.<br />
but no more a group of 915's with streamer benefits eating up all the maw/cos keys in sight. <br />
<br />
the 3 items for group or individual, that is the big question, everyone here is saying per group but its not worded like that<br />
&quot;When you finish a Mythic+ dungeon, the chest at the end will contain two items and an appropriate amount of Artifact Power.&quot;<br />
this makes it seems you get 2 actual items, not 6 chances at gold and ap.<br />
<br />
only when the build is live on the ptr we can see if its a huge buff or a giant nerf.</div></div><hr />

im not sure a lot of casual players will see it that way. before they could easily get a carry for +10 for the week in no time at all... now they have to work for it most will probably quit or get frustrated by high ilvl requirements for pug groups and give up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are doing a 10+, you're 3-chesting it and there is too much time left, so you go away and do something else to make the timer drop just enough for you to recieve an extra piece of loot. This is what he meant.<br />
<br />
Because that doesn't make since, unless I'm missing something (and hey I'm usually clueless anyway). Why wait for the timer to drop? You'll get the same extra loot regardless if you wait till it's close to expiring or finish a hour early.</div></div><hr />

Seriously though, I like the first change regarding the depleted keystones but the second change plain and simple is a loot nerf and they know full well that it is, the AP is hardly worth running M+ for, I run it for the gear due to the itemization in Nighthold being less than desirable for my class.

Getting the dungeon you wanted for gearupgrades was already rare but at least you could 3chest<br />
And get a bigger chance at the item you want. Now its bassicaly, well if you want that piece, run even more dungeons.<br />
And that in an expansion that's already so timeconsuming. Gg blizz. And that doesn't even touch that the qq from the lower<br />

<br />
By &quot;work for it&quot; i assume you mean &quot;put in more effort&quot;. I agree, they will. And yes, i imagine there will be some players that won't like these changes because it will be much harder to find boost groups.<br />
<br />
But the whole boost group thing is not good game design. Good game design means that players get rewarded for their own effort/time/skill. It involves incentivizing players to improve themselves as players. Put in effort towards a goal, then get rewards when they reach that goal. <br />
<br />
WoW is an MMO. It's a game designed to be played together with other people. To put in combined effort to reach a goal. To face obstacles that you can only beat with the help of your peers - each carrying his own weight. Boost groups don't do this.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if the challenging level for an individual's gear+skill is +2 or +20 - normal or mythic raider (let's just... ignore lfr... :D). A player should go into group content with the understanding that his contribution matters. Boost groups don't do this.<br />
<br />
I've recently leveled up &amp; geared an alt. I used boost groups to get geared, mostly because it was easy. I'm not gonna say it was impossible to do low level mythics with appropriate-ilvl geared players - i could have just queued myself up and invite people of my own ilvl. The option was there to get boosted so i took it. But i would honestly have had more fun playing with appropriate ilvl players, each actually contributing, without the depletion-doom hanging over my head, and without the &quot;finish it 10-15 minutes early and you get more loot&quot; carrot.<br />
<br />
I honestly believe these are great changes. <br />
<br />
Like we both said, not everyone will like it. There are those that prefer the situation of not having to contribute to get their &quot;reward&quot;, over having to pull their own weight. To get boosted through content where they could just have easily gone AFK at the entrance. But giving rewards for something a player did not earn himself is not a healthy state.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ScrubRouge</div><div class="date">2017-05-03, 03:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So they're making it even better to do Mythic+ over raids to get gear.<br />
<br />
Now, with these changes, if you deplete a key you still get TWO pieces of gear. If you get it in time which isn't very hard to do you get three pieces. <br />
<br />
Let's say you were gearing up now, you could deplete a +10, get two pieces of gear. Run the +9 that you get given for depleting and get 3 pieces of gear then run the +10/11/12 key you get and deplete it for 2 pieces of gear.<br />
<br />
M+ might be better for gearing than raiding if you are wanting to gear around Heroic raid content? Def not mythic raid (assuming reward vs time)</div></div><hr />

With this change, I no longer need to look for players who outgear the content. Because<br />
1. my key will not deplete <br />
2. The chest at the end is guaranteed 2 pieces of loot, with an additional piece even if I beat the timer by 2 seconds instead of 10 minutes. <br />
This also means I can enjoy the dungeon without having to constantly look at the timer to see if I am 3 chesting it or 2 chesting it<br />

The average player will be hurt by this, your key may be limitless but your time is not, its over half the loot in the same amount of time, if you had time to run 5 dungeons today you could net 15 chests with 2 loot each for 30 loot averaging out to about 6ish loot per person.<br />
<br />
With the changes you still only have time to run 5 dungeons but you'd only get 3 loot per dungeon or 15 loot loot total averaging out to 3 loot per person.<br />
<br />
It's just retarded, most of the changes are good but the whole point of it appears to be a reduction in loot.</div></div><hr />

If your group is pushing a +25 key and fail, now you have to do a 24 key again and then attempt a 25 of a new dungeon (which may not be favorable). I have to assume at the top the guys pushing the boundaries of M+ do a dungeon multiple times before they finally complete their depleted key to move onto 26 and beyond.<br />
<br />
That's because you can probably count those guys on your fingers. When compared with the general playerbase, they are just a tiny fraction of it, you don't balance a system around that.<br />

1 Change is good, 1 change is horrible. No keystone depletion is wonderful, for those who had issues with leavers/trolls/etc. its a non issue for most people though. The loot reduction however is far from welcome. It's half the loot in the same amount of time, its ridiculous and I can't believe more people aren't outraged at it.</div></div><hr />

It's literally the reason why these keys exist. <br />

Randoms have nothing to offer now. For me, that's great, because 95% of the community is a failure... but as far as blizzard intention goes, they completely 180° this.<br />

<br />
Say you start with a +8 key<br />
Beat timer by large margin 3 drops +11 key<br />
Beat timer narrowly 3 drops +12 Key<br />
Just miss timer 2 drops +11 key<br />
Beat timer narrowly 3 drops +12 key<br />
<br />
your group just keeps running at the level it can and hopefully gets 2 or more good runs in a row to progress up a level, all the while soaking up loot and the level your capable of. Should fix a LOT of the current toxic behaviour with PuGs for Mythic+ runs and make them fun rather than a grind!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Their goal is to get people to run appropriate level M+ content instead of overpowering it. This gets you part of the way there, but not all the way. The last issue I see is that there's no incentive outside of AP to run anything past the &quot;cap.&quot; (10 now, 15 in ToS). And the AP gains at higher levels aren't really that great.<br />
<br />
I like the idea of what someone said earlier in the thread, that each 2 levels past the cap gives you one more piece of loot. This would bring back higher loot per run, only you have to do actually difficult keys to get it rather than speed running easy keys. Solves a major complaint (less rewards per run), though granted only for people capable of pushing those higher mythics.<br />
<br />
Also would be nice if drop rates were adjusted based on the time it takes to complete the dungeon, but that's probably too much to hope for.</div></div><hr />

The key was meant to be a &quot;currency&quot; for players.<br />
Anyway, as mentioned, the whole key thing is completely unnecessary now.

Its literally the biggest reason good geared players do dungeons below their gearlevel.<br />
Also, since 7.2 the availability of keys has gone down a lot already, and I only assumme<br />
This will make it even worse. I don't really care as I mostly run keys within the guild.<br />
But for people bound to the lfg tool, I assumme this will be horrendous. People saying oh yh good<br />
Change, I can run keys with people my gearlevel now etc. What do you think will happen when you wipe<br />
On a boss a couple of times, or if the highest key you manage to clear is a plus 5? You think this will<br />
Make the playerbase happy, when they could easily get any key boosted to plus 10 in the current<br />
System? I would think not.</div></div><hr />

With this, you'll only run any key for more than one chest if you missed a week and need to catch back up to where you'll get reasonable loot again. Other than that, you'll now hit your sweet point (where you know you'll get the chest and a good chance for upgrade) and bounce between 1 and fail chest for loot and AP. Group finder will be full of people looking to only complete the run, yes, but then they'll also feel like failing it next so they can come back for another key.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Case in point; I got a Cathedral of Eternal Night +14 I didn't even attempt last week because the higher-geared/skilled people in my guild didn't log on and a PUG was highly likely to burn it, if they even stayed to finish the run at all. Under the new system, if the run failed horribly, I'd at least get some loot and go backwards one level, not as bad a penalty as losing an entire keystone and ending my climb that week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do people honestly think now all of a sudden when i'm selecting people for a key i'm going to just grab whoever at whatever ilvl because of this? That seems incredibly naive when I can be more selective and grab 910+ by stretching it out over maybe an extra minute or two. But you only get 1 chest anyway so it doesn't matter! except it does.... <br />
<br />
in the current system it's very rare people give a shit about what the key turns into they leave immediately after looting, the faster you complete dungeons the faster you can begin looking for another 7-11 key you want to run. Obviously not everyone runs this way but I can't see anything but the vast majority of m+ runners in those brackets being those that hunt for titanforges.<br />
<br />
The depletion change is fine I guess, however I could see this being a major blow to the pick up group system, It will probably become way more comfortable for groups to game the system within their groups rather than seek external keys just bouncing between stones and depleting on purpose to keep the best possible loot curve.<br />
<br />
It just strikes me as blizzard changing the system for the sake of change well ignoring the actual perceived issue which is titanforging to begin with.</div></div><hr />

<br />
so for me there is not point running a +13 (the extra AP is rubbish for the difficulty jump).. ideal scenario is get a good dungeon on a +10, 3 chest it with guildies then de-level it 3 times back to +10, and rinse repeat. If the +13 you get is bad, use another guildies key.</div></div><hr />

No, it will get me (who currently pretty much only does M+ as DD in guild runs) to eventually play a bit in random groups. I have two tank alts and the highest I ever tanked was a +2 because the community sees everything below 3 chests as a failure.</div></div><hr />

Also keep in mind that the bonus AP will scale up to +30<br />
<br />
As for the loot yeah its a nerf for lower keys, but once you got up to the higher ones right now you could only +1 with the occasional +2 anyway, this will actually give you 1 more piece of loot at the very high levels than is the case right now maybe offering some extra incentive to actually do higher keys outside the bonus AP at both the end of the run and the weekly cache.<br />

There is no incentive to go over the max. Why spend more time doing a 18-20 when you can do 2-3 10's in that time?</div></div><hr />

You have never gotten 6 items from a mythic dungeon. What are you smoking? <br />

You have always gotten 2 sometimes 3. 2 extra chests are usually empty. This change is good and people were saying that the depletion mechanic should have been removed ever since the expansions release. It's too little too late most people have already quit the game.</div></div><hr />

There is no way in hell I see blizzard changing the reward from 6 pieces awarded over a group to 15.

So if you finished the dungeon within the time ! Is every player able to loot 2 pieces + 1. Or is the whole group gifted with in this case 3 pieces ?<br />
<br />
Its very important, because if every player is gifted with 3 pieces, I will totally quit raiding and spend my whole time in M+ lol<br />
<br />
Currently there are 2 pieces of loot per chest for the entire group so I would assume that implies 3 pieces total, so it's a 50% buff to people failing the timer or 1 chest, a 25% nerf to a 2 chest, and a 50% nerf to a 3 chest.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard already fucks over mythic raiding enough with their poorly thought-out Titanforge scheme. With summer approaching and another MMO (Final Fantasy?) potentially drawing people's interest away I suspect this will be one of the few times of the year where Blizzard actually pays attention and responds quickly to feedback.</div></div><hr />

Think about it, come on. If 80% of undergeared players get their keys boosted instead of doing them normally, and 20% run them normally, your pool is small, you have to fish overgeared players.<br />
<br />
But now that boosting will be killed off, all the undergeared players, aside from those with friends, will need to actually put effort in and join groups of other low-mid geared players to try and get gear. <br />

But it does change a lot, if you do a key now that you'd 1 chest, you get 2 items, in 7.2.5 you'd get 3 items. <br />
<br />
So if 15 is the cap, most groups doing it would 1 chest (getting 1 extra item) or in some cases 2 chest it, (only losing item). <br />
<br />
So groups getting gear, wouldn't be losing out on items.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, but the pool of high demand roles (tank/healer) will drastically reduce at any given level.<br />
<br />
Thus my point ... harder than ever to get an M+ run.<br />
<br />
I'm iLvl 900, and I've still yet to do a +10, mostly doing +6/+7 ... just due to lack of people. Soon I won't even get the +6/+7 as the tanks/healers will stick to the +10 etc.</div></div><hr />

This statement here seems to be very abusable. What prevents me of entering a M+ dungeon by myself, starting the run, leave the dungeon and reset it to decrease the level of my stone until I feel comfortable with the difficulty?

I agree, they will. And yes, i imagine there will be some players that won't like these changes because it will be much harder to find boost groups.<br />
<br />
But the whole boost group thing is not good game design. Good game design means that players get rewarded for their own effort/time/skill. It involves incentivizing players to improve themselves as players. Put in effort towards a goal, then get rewards when they reach that goal. <br />
<br />
WoW is an MMO. It's a game designed to be played together with other people. To put in combined effort to reach a goal. To face obstacles that you can only beat with the help of your peers - each carrying his own weight. Boost groups don't do this.<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter if the challenging level for an individual's gear+skill is +2 or +20 - normal or mythic raider (let's just... ignore lfr... :D). A player should go into group content with the understanding that his contribution matters. Boost groups don't do this.<br />
<br />
I've recently leveled up &amp; geared an alt. I used boost groups to get geared, mostly because it was easy. I'm not gonna say it was impossible to do low level mythics with appropriate-ilvl geared players - i could have just queued myself up and invite people of my own ilvl. The option was there to get boosted so i took it. But i would honestly have had more fun playing with appropriate ilvl players, each actually contributing, without the depletion-doom hanging over my head, and without the &quot;finish it 10-15 minutes early and you get more loot&quot; carrot.<br />
<br />
I honestly believe these are great changes. <br />
<br />
Like we both said, not everyone will like it. There are those that prefer the situation of not having to contribute to get their &quot;reward&quot;, over having to pull their own weight. To get boosted through content where they could just have easily gone AFK at the entrance. But giving rewards for something a player did not earn himself is not a healthy state.<br />
<br />
If they want this, they should return to the TBC model of normal + heroic and NOTHING ELSE. And just one raid difficulty per raid dungeon and NOTHING ELSE. Only this will stop the segregation of the playerbase into small groups with a more or less specifically tuned difficulty.<br />
<br />
And also remove this RNG stats and RNG upgrade crap. There is no sense of progression when a random WQ item can titanforge into a 900 thing. And there is no sense of progression if you cannot target a specific item but only have to hope that this time you will get the right stats.</div></div><hr />

I don't see anything in there saying you can't finish it fast still. Just that if you finish it fast you don't get extra loot because you over geared it basically. If anything it'll encourage people to run Mythic +'s on par with their gear level. Also, if you finish a keystone fast you are rewarded with the extra time to do another one or get on with something else.<br />
<br />
And how is that a reward if you can already do it? How is that an extra time? That would be the same thing as saying ok you can clear NH mythic in 2 hours from starting, GD will drop 40% less items because you over gear it, but look at the bright side, you have extra time to do other things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess that was the point? I think Blizz doesn't really think that being carried means playing the game. I think Blizz thinks that players should play their appropriate difficulty, meaning:<br />
- undergeared people should do low level M+. They shouldn't get gear they didn't 'earn' (by whatever standard)<br />
- geared people should do high level M+. They shouldn't farm lower level ones for 'easy' loot (= grind, time spent, but not effort). Nor should they boost people.<br />
This is why Blizz didn't expect that many people doing M+, because they thought a casual player won't do M+. They thought the casual player wouldn't be offered this 'boost' and therefore provide an endless supply of low level keys for high geared players. The causal player might have done his +2 and stop but why wouldn't he do his +9 if he gets 3-chests from a few runs for 'free'.<br />
<br />
The fact that humans in general try to get the most by putting the least effort in expands to the game is not a premise Blizz wants to understand. They try to 'fix' people this way. I sometimes wish it weren't so, that games would stay 'clean' of this human behaviour since the rewards aren't really tangible, but that's a hope long dead.</div></div><hr />

1) We no longer have a 2-3 chest timer, there's only 1 timer and 1 chest.<br />
<br />
2) The number of loot shared among the group is no longer 3 chests X 2 loot each chest but now 1 chest X 3 loot?<br />
<br />
1) The timer system doesn't change. But it doesn't give you extra chest/loot anymore. it will be always 1 chest. The result only determines your next key level.<br />
You only need to be in time to get 3 loot.<br />
<br />
2) In Time = 3 loot, not in Time = 2 loot <br />
<br />
This change makes low level key less appealing since you will get only half of the loot (3 instead of 6) but higher lvl keys you usually don't 3 or 2 chest wield yield more if you make it in time.</div></div><hr />

Carries were never, EVER Blizzard's intention for M+, and what you've just described - going in as a 5/5 guild group and doing content that is appropriate for your gear/skill level - is exactly what Blizzard wanted M+ to be. The only reason that this low-level M+ key spam is a thing is because they dropped the ball and heavily overincentivized quick, overgeared runs.</div></div><hr />

The system doesn't have a high pool of players because it's good or fun, it has a high pool of players because it has great rewards for content that players are way overgeared for.

<br />
The idea is that they want people do be participating in M+ levels that are relatively hard for them, which translates into M+ levels where they'd previously only be getting 1 chest. That's why the amount of items seems so low, but it's actually a buff in those kinds of environments.<br />
<br />
Remember, the only reason that multiple chests was ever a thing as because they expected keystones to be a more valuable commodity, and they didn't want people to feel like they &quot;missed out&quot; on something by having their keystone jump multiple levels at once.<br />
<br />
2-3 items for the group isn't that bad if you're looking at M+ items where it's probably going to be upgrades, as opposed to a deluge of quick loot where you're hoping for titanforges. That said, I wouldn't mind if they bumped it up to 4 pieces.</div></div><hr />

You do know it's 3 pieces in the chest, not 3 pieces per player right? So with this system, the group is getting half the amount of loot that you would have by 3 chesting the run.</div></div><hr />

Lol, you're a fool. <br />

It is on you, anyone can go do a +10, they just need to put the effort in to find a group. Others can find groups easily, why can't you? Clearly doing something wrong.</div></div><hr />

Ummm no, it's 2 or 3 items in the chest, not 2 or 3 items per player. so if you would have 3 chested pre nerf, you get 6 items in the chests (3 chests 2 items per chest) now, you get one chest containing g just 3 items for the group</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was 6 items for your group if you 3 chested.<br />
It is, with this change, 3 items for your group if you make it in time.<br />
<br />
Both situations, you can get loot or no loot. But first one had 6 loot.<br />

Now people will actually be incentivized to participate in the highest level of M+ that they can manage, which is perfect.<br />
snip<br />
<br />
Nope they aren't.<br />
<br />
People doing it for loot will now form a guild group of 5. Play a +10 in 3-chest time, go into the new dungeon, put key in, reset (x3), then play the next +10 in 3-chest time. Rinse, repeat. You now effectively have removed the need to rely on other people's keys, so you can purely farm in your own 5-man group. EDIT: for clarity, +10 is in today's world. If max moved to +15, then it's the same on that level.<br />
<br />
People doing it for prestige will still run high keys in their 5-man group. No change, except for maybe more loot for them, but mostly, they are the ones that don't need the loot anyway, except titanforged.<br />
<br />
People farming AP will do the same as the first group, just prioritize the &quot;long&quot; dungeons (HoV, Arc). The additional AP you get in higher keys is just not worth the additional time you spend on them.</div></div><hr />

I don't think it's elitist if you want to raid with people on your same level. If I'm overgearing a Raid, I certainly don't want to carry some low-geared people through a PUG, as this is just wasting my time. <br />
<br />
If you're complaining about these requirements, then either you are one of those low-geared ones that wants to be carried, or you're just too lazy to open your own PuG.</div></div><hr />

Are we still going to see the best loot drop at +10 or will we have any incentive to run higher keys at all?<br />
I'm asking this as a 2400 m+ player. If these changes go through and you continue to cap the ilvl at lower keys(Anything below 25) people will just continue to farm at the cap level.<br />
890 gear should be rewarded at +13ish difficulty. At +20ish we should probably see 900 gear. At +25 we should be seeing +910 or even 915 gear drop consistently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whats the point putting this custom 'ilvl requirement' per leader choice if the people you're bringing with are garbage ANYONE can be carried to gear.<br />
<br />
It's the one thing that's always annoyed me with phantom ilvl requirements made up by certain groups of &quot;Elitists&quot; as some call them there more to a player and their ability then ilvl. These caps is what stops these sets of players from getting gear in the 1st place..</div></div><hr />

Groups always wanting only overgeared players is an issue and may be reduced slightly by this change. Also I did not like that M+ basicly only revolves around going as fast as you can not as big. <br />
<br />
However it does make M+ very unprofitable due to the loss of bonus chests, while going fast at any difficult wont get you anything extra and the ilvl cap(+10keys) is already way below what many people are comfortable running fast. <br />
The idea to incentivise stronger groups to run higher key stones would be great, just that besides &quot;a feeling of accomplishment&quot; there is no reward whatsoever to run higher keys while there is also none in running smaller keys fast. <br />
Thus in my opinion while the change may result in fairer group avaibalility for lower keys and a partial &quot;encouragement&quot; to run higher keys the main thing, a proper reward or at least the chance of of one for running higher keys is still missing. <br />
<br />
The system was basicly &quot;taken&quot; from Diablo 3 which also favours fast runs over high runs for loot, but only to a point since there afaik at least higher difficulties has increased chances for e.g. ancient items which would correspond maybe to an increased chance for titanforged gear in higher keys which is missing.</div></div><hr />

Or instead of wasting your time you could just do a second dungeon ?<br />
<br />
Sorry to put some logic in here. But if you have 90 minutes to do some dungeon. Rushing them will still give you more loot because you'll run more dungeon than someone not able to 3 chests them...<br />

Your game time is not infinite, no matter how nolife you are. Doing more dungeon in said time will give you more loot, period. No point in &quot;waiting for timer&quot;.</div></div><hr />

No thx, instead we will just burst an instance as usual and go AFK for 5-10 mins before there will be several minutes on the timer and successfully complete the run. Now it will be this way for our group: 1 13+ - to recieve 10+ keys for the next week and 4 10+ for 4 chests. If we will want more we just AFK the timer so the key will upgrade no more than +1.</div></div><hr />

Usually you can BARELY make it to 3 chests, if doing 10+ or higher runs. Also, there are only a few long instances - usually it wont take more than 3-5 mins to upgrade the key no more than +1. Call it smoke break?<br />

Issue on Live : People are rushing through Mythic + like mad man, doing multiple pull at once, giving the healer hell. Zerg it is the only solution if so you can get 3 chest.<br />
How they are solving it : 3 Chest gone. You still get a tiny reward if you are the key user because you key get upgraded faster but for 80%, the mark is now just to complete the timer(3 gear instant of 2).<br />

Why are people keep talking like everyone get a key at the end of a run. They even used the world USED or like live where you only the key user get a new key.

However the 3 chest loss seems to be a bit shortsighted. There's now no reward for doing an amazing run. I've 3 chested some 14/15s and its a nice feeling to get the 3 chests. Now i guess we will be watching the timer to get the most keys. complete the dungeons just before timer runs out so you get the 3 items and 1 level upgrade on key for maximum loot and AP from 1 person key building.</div></div><hr />

I don't see how this would solve any of the issues mentioned in the blue post, the changes would actually make these even worse while also removing any incentive to play high-level keystones in time. The majority of players will still look for the most efficient way to play M+, meaning maximizing item gains with minimal time exposure.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, players who love M+ content need an incentive to play it properly. That incentive is getting an amount of AP and a number of high-level items that are appropriate to the time invested in gaining these rewards. By removing the additional items rewarded for completing a dungeon fast (+3), you also remove any incentive to run high-level M+ in time. It would take ridiculous amounts of AP to convince me that trying to get +3 in a +15 is worth it.<br />
The blue post states that the reward for doing an M+ in time (which honestly is the lowest expectation you could possibly have when running M+ dungeons) already bears the maximum rewards available. Like I said, &quot;more AP&quot; isn't convincing unless the amounts are insane - if they aren't, it'd be more efficient to run multiple lower keys in a row.<br />
<br />
Let's say +10 remains the item level cap, people would &quot;want&quot; to run +11, deplete it on purpose, get 2 items and a -1 key, do the +10 in time for +3 items and a +1 key, rinse and repeat. Why would I still want to run +15 or +17, like I do right now? Why would I still try to do my best in any M+ to play mechanics properly, to pull exactly as many trash packs as the current group can handle without risking a wipe? Why would I use flasks, prepots and buff food, like in a raid? There simply is no reason to play any key above +10 in time, there is no reason to use actual tactics, setup, or to challenge yourself and your (guild) group. And why would Blizzard want to create an environment that makes you want to purposely fail an M+ dungeon, because the rewards to do so are just a little less than what you'd get for actually putting effort into it?<br />
<br />
People here often talk about &quot;elitists&quot; and issues with being declined in the LF tool - but I'm sorry, that's not all there is out there. There are organized groups that have lots of fun going as high as possible each week. I, too, run M+ without the need to look for randoms, and we aren't boosting low keys, we play as many dungeons above +10 with all our mains and alts as possible each week. So yeah, we run +15 and above each week. All my friends and their guilds do the same. We all have fun with the challenge and we're getting appropriate rewards for those. With these changes, however, we'd all kinda lose something that's a major content for us.<br />
<br />
I honestly hope these changes don't go live as they are and that the responsible developers think about leaving an appropriate incentive for strong players to go as high as possible in their weekly M+ efforts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is essentially a feedback to the people that get timer anxiety, both in terms of no more depletion as well as no reward from pushing keys faster aside from being efficient with your time. These are probably the bigger demographics of people that play, and they are the people that are least likely to even get a +2 in an instance appropriate for them.<br />
<br />
The biggest issue with people spamming low key is still the lack of soft cap on WF/TF though, which is something they also don't want to touch from what i've seen. <br />
<br />
I think there are good changes but the really good players seems to be getting the short end of the stick here, again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's per person and the 2 loot items is only if you complete the run after the timer expires. If you complete it with any time remaining on the clock they're will be a 3rd item in the chest as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have always gotten 2 sometimes 3. 2 extra chests are usually empty. This change is good and people were saying that the depletion mechanic should have been removed ever since the expansions release. It's too little too late most people have already quit the game.<br />
<br />
Good Lord, its six per group, how hard is that to understand. Its going to 3 per group, so yes its a huge nerf that's not needed. And you go ahead and keep saying most have quit, all I see on a daily basis is most returning, anecdotal is anecdotal.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Swalload</div><div class="date">2017-05-03, 01:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To maximize loot though you'll want to do a +2 (3 pieces), +3 (6 pieces), +4 (9 Pieces), +5 (12 pieces)<br />
<br />
If you go fast you'll get +2(3 pieces), +5(6 pieces) and on top of that you miss out on chests for legendaries and BLP<br />
<br />
+2-+5 slow is 4 chests<br />
<br />
+2-+5 fast is 2 chests<br />
<br />
+2-+5 in 7.2 fast is 6 chests, unless they up the drop rate significantly for legendaries from M+ is a loss that way too.<br />
<br />
+2-+5 slow takes over 2 hours.<br />
+2-+5 fast takes less than an hour.<br />
<br />
That gives you 2 hour to do another 2 higher dungeons, meaning you get the same amount of chests, in less or same time, and it's higher ilvl. And more AP, and less boring.<br />
So the +2-+5 is in fact +2-+11 in roughly the same amount of time assuming you can handle +11 rather decently.<br />
<br />
Your entire logic is so flawed I don't even know how you go through life.</div></div><hr />

<br />
reducing change at lego by 2/3 (really the only reason other than AP we do carries)<br />
<br />
For us time is the commodity. The way these changes are, we will likely stop carrying pug keys and almost exclusively do 5/5 player guild keys. Which is a big blow to the casual players who look for these carries each week for the weekly chest.<br />
<br />
This is actually good point. I have not thought about it in that way. I guess it will mean less boosts, but it will also mean people will now be less demanding of ilvl to do the content? I know I will, it will not deplete baby!!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Demeia</div><div class="date">2017-05-03, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Carries were never, EVER Blizzard's intention for M+, and what you've just described - going in as a 5/5 guild group and doing content that is appropriate for your gear/skill level - is exactly what Blizzard wanted M+ to be. The only reason that this low-level M+ key spam is a thing is because they dropped the ball and heavily overincentivized quick, overgeared runs.<br />
<br />
Actually if you read the original Watcher quotes on this, they thought the key limitation would get people to take less experienced, weaker players because those people had keys. <br />
<br />
Personally, I just do one to get the legendary shot at the end of the week; my guild simply doesn't have people on at consistent times to do mythic+. I think perhaps they are imagining that a higher percentage of people expect to get loot from these dungeons. Dealing with Skittish is simply not worth the trouble to me. And the whole lfg system is soul-draining. Few things in WoW depress me more than looking for a mythic+ group. In 900 gear, it's hard to get 2s and 4s even if that's all you care about. This isn't particularly anyone's fault but I wonder if they are misinterpreting some of the data. Between legendaries, set pieces, there's not a lot of chance of getting an item that would be valuable to me even if I did high level mythic+ content. <br />
<br />
As for AP, they have completely succeeded in their goal of making it something I don't stress about at all; thus, something I won't be doing mythic+ for.</div></div><hr />

I think you miss the point.<br />
When I was levelling my DH I got from ilvl 800 to 900 in about 2 weeks without any help of guildmates or friends. Of course I got carried by higher ilvl groups in NH normal, then heroic. But I almost ripped my ass trying to do my best, I was always ready with all consumables and tactics knowledge, I didnt make a single mistake during those runs and stayed competitive. Also I NEVER insulted anyone who rejected me (99% people I whispered).<br />
Those low ilvl guys - I cannot say for all of them, but from my broad expirience they are not even trying to be competitive with higher ilvl guys, they do 200k DPS on a boss and complain if someone notice it like &quot;man, whats wrong with your DPS&quot;? If they get kicked they asspull a boss wiping entire party, leaving and in 5 seconds they are in a queue again looking for a new prey.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would you think it's per person? The CHEST contains two items full stop. Not two items per person, just two items. (with a third if you beat the time). If it was per person, that would mean the chest contains10 items which would be insane.</div></div><hr />

Let us focus on trying to get high times in 1 dungeon and only give us loot on the first one or something.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocada6ff965a</div><div class="date">2017-05-03, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My perspective is one as part of a group that is pushing very high keys. While I don't have the time to perfect every dungeon like some of us do, many players in my guild play beyond an M+ rating of 2k. We also boost customers through anything they are willing to pay for.<br />
<br />
The changes, as usual, have positive and negative aspects. For the sake of clarity, let's break down the incentives that are being touched here. There's AP, gear and M+ rating. Depending on where you stand with your character, these carry different weight. <br />
<br />
The issue of AP as a reward was already tackled to some extent by the changes to AP/time ratios. The system has become a lot more reasonable than it was during the time of Maw farming. The new changes will preserve the AP reward for higher keys, which is nice. However, with the adjusments to AP progression and the corresponding final weapon trait, things have cooled down a bit anyway. If this is different for the frontier progress raiders, feel free to correct this statement. I'm just not convinced that the addition of AP does much to incentivize people to do higher keys.<br />
<br />
Secondly, there's the issue of farming gear from M+. In a way, the changes adjust the curve, increasing the incentive to do higher keys for gear. Currently, there's a steep increase in the curve close to +10 and a hard drop afterwards. Since you can't increase the ilvl of the gear that drops, you can only make it more difficult for yourself. While that does not change in principle, you now have a much flatter curve around +10. This reduces the incentive to carry people for the sake of their key, but doesn't take it away entirely. It does, however, incentivize people to progress slower past +10 to get as much gear out of their keys with as little effort as possible. However, this shouldn't be a big problem. For one, since your next key is random you can't specifically target a dungeon to exploit the mechanic. People will still continue to chainrun keys where they need gear; there will still be CoS boost groups. Furthermore, since you can't cheese the system by intentionally depleting your key either, you can only use the mechanic to selectively adjust your difficulty. That's a good thing as well, because the incentive remains to complete the dungeon. There's no harm done if you reset to make your life easier. The worst that could happen would be that people don't go beyond 10 who are farming loot on a random basis. Seems familiar. <br />
<br />
Thirdly, this does nothing to the motivation of runners who push for the highest keys possible. In order to push keys you already need to have the gear to do it. If you don't have the gear, see point 2, make a +10 boost group. The motivation for people to do the highest keys has never been AP or gear, but M+ score on wowprogress. That won't change with these adjustments. What it will do, however, is to make it harder to push these scores. Previously, you could just bash your head against a +20 key until you managed to beat it, resetting it over and over again. That won't work anymore, which challenges the most motivated M+ runners even more. While it sucks to now have only one chance to pull of a perfect run per key, it won't have an impact on the competition because everyone plays by the same rules. It means that you can make even fewer mistakes if you want to be on top, which is just fine, but if you do make a mistake you'll at least still get a small reward for your time.<br />
<br />
tl;dr: Good stuff.</div></div><hr />

Are you 100% sure on that as what is stated in the Blue post is very vague on that part..<br />
<br />
&quot;:When you finish a Mythic+ dungeon, the chest at the end will contain two items and an appropriate amount of Artifact Power.&quot;<br />
&quot;:If you beat the timer, regardless of how quickly, there will be a third item in the chest.&quot;<br />
<br />
As you can see they are being quite vague on this part.. Only real way to know what is going on is to get onto the PTR and actually see if this is a per person or per group thing.. The other thing is depending on the item there is still the loot trade option either way have to see what those on the PTR are finding out..</div></div><hr />
