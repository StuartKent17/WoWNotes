Mage Tower Appearances<br />
The current plan is for the base Challenge skins to become legacy. However, if you unlock a Challenge skin in Legion, the other 3 tints should remain obtainable going forward (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1075242-mage-tower-becoming-legacy/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/17616984887?page=1#4))<br />

&quot;Tint&quot; means color, so as long as you have the first (ie. completed the mage tower for that spec), you can unlock the other color variants later.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They already get more stamina passively, compared to Warrior's. Considering Paladin's get a % HP increase from artifact traits, while Warrior's get a % Stamina increase. And then again, they don't have to choose between wet noodle DPS or relevant DPS.</div></div><hr />

With lego legs and DI it doesn't even take that much haste to reach 100% DS tanking up time. If you can't keep up DS you probably have no idea how to VDH currently.<br />
<br />
His post is hyperbole though. Equally geared and outside of meta VDH is still a good 1 mil or more hp behind bear, only has &quot;fairly close to DK&quot; self healing if fighting lots of mobs at once(on single target it's actually one of the lowest HPS tank specs in the game).<br />
<br />
With these health buffs to VDH and Prot Pal(along with the great set bonuses in both for antorus) I'm actually confidant this makes prot war dead last tanks though. Sorry mate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I seem to recall my warr alt has about the same HP as my paladin main tank, with 30 item levels below. I did take some talent with stamina if I recall right.<br />
The bear that offtanks with me has like 50% more health than I do on my paladin, so frankly 10% doesn't even cut it. And yes, the health does matter when you have CDs based on your health (like Ardent Defender).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Apart from the fact that Warrior's cannot block spells, and Paladin's can, have constant uptime on 12% melee damage reduction and have more passive damage reduction baseline? Yeah, not really. SotR reduces all damage, Warrior's just have high uptime on Physical blocks, which frankly sucks as Paladin's already block 10% more damage, which Warrior's only get through a trait (aside from the fact they can Crit block, which again does nothing against spells).<br />

That is exactly my point, Warrior's need to take the talent to get health that is on par, but will lack a lot of DPS and rage generation.</div></div><hr />

Warrior can have 100% uptime on block and also block way more damage ;)<br />
<br />
Ignore pain still exists...<br />
<br />
warrior can have 100% uptime on shield block (40/80% blockable damage reduction - some adds in ToS are doing magic melee hit that can be blocked)<br />
<br />
also with t21 and t20 we can probably push to 100% uptime on demo shout (20% damage reduction) and fucshittonload of rage and vastly reduced CD on last stand and shield wall<br />
<br />
also warrior doesn't really need higher HP if you play it correctly, expecting big hit, you will pool rage to get the meaty 4 mil absorb (that would put me to 11.5 EHP)</div></div><hr />

Seraphim would like to have a word with you, choosing between dps and active mitigation. <br />
<br />
<br />
Apart from the fact that Warrior's cannot block spells, and Paladin's can, Paladin can block spells... at the cost of dps or legendary slot (holy shield is a dps downgrade to blessed hammer). Warrior has spell reflect which you use when you want and not pray to rng that you actually block that spell you care about. <br />

I was born a warrior ! (my first ever class)<br />
<br />
The thing is, warriors can be equally good to any tank if played very well and propperly. also the top used tanks are getting bad/really strange t21 set bonuses (like bear or monk) while the less picked tanks are actually getting good set bonuses (warr, pala)<br />
<br />
To me, every tank are pretty much equal in terms of viability in mythic raiding but some of them requires way more effort and are more hardly punished by making mistakes while for example bear can be played with steering wheel and a mistake you make, won't instantly kill you</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is shield block better than DS? Average 30% parry w/ new tier on top of 15% base parry, with 35%+ physical reduction works out to a permanent 58% physical reduction. The only issue DHs had is that felclaws isn't parry-able, but it's blockable so there's no argument warriors are better for that. And DH's would have been fine if they made felclaws once a min instead of every 50 seconds so we could have fiery brand up for every one.<br />
<br />
I don't think DHs will be FotM, but they'll be very competitive unless they design tank checks to screw us over again.</div></div><hr />

Average 30% parry w/ new tier on top of 15% base parry, with 35%+ physical reduction works out to a permanent 58% physical reduction. The only issue DHs had is that felclaws isn't parry-able, but it's blockable so there's no argument warriors are better for that.

100% uptime, 40/80% reduction, I have 20% parry but as you said, it barely works on boss abilities, Also IP shields <br />
<br />
And warriors have more base armor</div></div><hr />

Yes, and DHs have 20% general DR from demonic wards to compensate on the armor, fiery brand etc. (I wasn't comparing the whole package, though yeah, you'd probably have to).<br />
<br />
With 40% block, which I believe translates into 40% chance of critical block with shield block up, you're talking about (1- (.6*.6) + .4 *.2), 56% physical reduction, slightly less than DHs. Basically, DHs should be taking the lowest auto-attack damage of any tanking class, and if they keep up the style of ToS, that'll matter quite a bit. If the rest of our toolkit works well for the fights, unlike KJ, DHs will be strong. Especially if they don't nerf the 4-piece, though I understand that's expected to happen.<br />
<br />
I think warriors will be as well, and I'd love to have half as much raid utility as the 3% leech. DHs do have a decently strong CD package though, which will be better with 4-piece, so there's some small potential DHs could end up being a stronger tank depending on how the fights play out.</div></div><hr />

Generally, warriors have 5% damage reduction with NL thunder trait, high uptime on demo shout (like 30 ish % on single target) that's another 20% and as for now, I have 10k armor (57,74%) <br />
<br />
Shield block is 100% to block and critical block chance is calculated from mastery (50-55% depending on my gear setup) that's generally 60% reduction<br />
<br />
Ignore Pain can alone in very high sustained damage go up to 500k hps (mind that you can't really overheal with it since it allways going down with damage)<br />
<br />
This all makes warrior THE BEST tank against physical (sometimes even magic) blockable damage. I tanked alongside every other tank class and every time I took less damage than any other class .<br />
<br />
I'm not really saying here that warrior is the bestest tank ever. As I said the top pick tanks are getting shitty/strange t21 set bonuses while lesser picked tanks getting really solid set bonuses (for pala, it helps with AM downtime, DH gets reduced meta CD, warr gets obscene single target burst and rage injection from it)</div></div><hr />

I think you're quite off base on that point. Perhaps you were cheesing things for damage since it's farm for you, but when I when I looked up a M Goroth log you took ~1.3 million damage per melee cast while I took 740k. That's quite a differential for physical blockable (and parryable) damage in favor of DHs, so the relative performance differences you've seen may have more to do with you being a very good warrior than class differences.</div></div><hr />
