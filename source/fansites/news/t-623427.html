We had a few words with Nymh (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek%27thar&amp;n=Nymh), the first player in the world to reach level 80 in Wrath of the Lich King. <br />

<br />
MMO-Champion: Hello Nymh, and congratulations for your level 80 ! Could you tell us a bit more about yourself ? <br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Nymh: I play a warlock named Nymh (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek%27thar&amp;n=Nymh) on the french server Drek'thar. I used to be the guild leader of Harmonie, a french top PvE guild who was among the first 10 guilds to kill Kil'jaeden in France, but we eventually decided to merge with the 2nd guild of our server. The result is Genesis, which was originally an pre-BC high level guild. In real life I'm 21 and currently employed, I took a few days of vacation for the release of the expansion. <br />
<br />
MMO-Champion: You reached the max level 27 hours after the european servers went online, that's pretty fast even if you spend all your time leveling ... Could you tell us how you achieved that ? <br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Nymh: The idea first came up when I saw this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=16919.0) from Jynxx (http://www.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Turalyon&amp;n=Jynxx). The idea looked nice and I decided to run a few tests on beta servers. It took about 3 hours to level from 78 to 79 and considering that it was one of the longest level, it seemed good enough to use this strategy to powerlevel at the release. <br />
<br />
The biggest problem was to find a spot with enough monsters to grind without too much downtime ... I spent some time on beta servers and eventually found the crypt in Drakil'ji Ruins (Grizzly Hills), I think that's one of the only place in Wrath of the Lich King where monsters repop in about 30 seconds, mobs here are also neutral and it makes grinding a little safer. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I also had to optimize my downtimes and decided to level with a healer out of party, Pavelomm (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek'Thar&amp;n=Pavelomm) was nice enough to spend the last 27 hours healing me without taking any XP and he obviously played a huge role in the process. <br />
<br />
When I reached level 76 I realized that my leveling speed was slightly lower than what I experienced in beta, I decided to change the template from the original post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=16919.0) and switched to something with 2 points in Shadow Mastery to make my DoTs stronger and the leveling a bit easier. (It usually takes 2 DoTs to kill a monster)<br />
<br />
MMO-Champion: The first level 80 was supposed to be Darus, a paladin who did some powerleveling in instances with Athene and a few other people and eventually got suspended by Blizzard at level 79. (and reseted to level 70 a few hours later) Did you hear about him ?<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Nymh: Yeah I had a few people monitoring other servers to give me updates about the situation here, I don't really know how Darus did that but I assume it will be hotfixed by Blizzard very soon. <br />
<br />
MMO-Champion: Is there anyone you want to thank ? <br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Nymh: Sure ! There are a bunch of people who helped a lot with my leveling. <br />
<br />
Pavelomm (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek'Thar&amp;n=Pavelomm) was nice enough to stay with me for the last 27 hours and managed to keep me alive for all this time!<br />
Pratax (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek'Thar&amp;n=Pratax) originally planned to level with me but couldn't be here due to last minute work obligations, he helped me a lot during beta when I was planning everything. <br />
Ardanell (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek'Thar&amp;n=Ardanell) / Bro (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek'Thar&amp;n=Bro) / Zhazha (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Drek'Thar&amp;n=Zhazha) were nice enough to run all the way to Grizzly Hills to teleport me to Ironforge and let me train my new spells without wasting too much time. <br />
Coralie, who was nice enough to buy me the game 2 days ago! <br />
<br />
And of course, the whole Genesis (http://www.guilde-genesis.org/) guild and all the players from Drek'thar-EU!</div></div><hr />

<br />
They went in to 5-mans, darus tagged all the mobs, then the 5 man finished them off. A GM previously told them it was a &quot;clever use of the game mechanics&quot; or something to that effect. Then when they actually used it, they got banned. That's the story, at least.<br />

He deserves to be the world first with the effort he put in, first in beta and then on his live server. Kudos to his mate for assisting for 27 hours straight with no benefit of his own. That's real camaraderie. :)<br />

He has screenshots of a GM on his realm confirming that there was a 0% chance he would get banned for using the mob tagging technique a different GM ended up banning him for. There is no excuse for banning him after that confirmation. <br />
<br />
Aside from that if you think about Nymh and Athene used similar exploits or &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot;. Both of them had a player or players helping them grind the mobs down outside of their party. Nymph had a player not in his party healing him as he tagged the mobs while Athene had players not in his party dps'ing the mobs instead. Theres virtually no difference as its players helping you defeat enemies while you get all the xp and they get none.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, actually, there is no excuse for the GM being as silly. Most players knew or ad least predicted that this was or would be a bannable offense, and that it was an exploit in the way tagging mobs works. Athene and his folks knew this for pretty damn sure, and went to find some GM who didn't - otherwise, why would they have asked in the first place.<br />
<br />
As shallow an achievement as this is anyway, the way Nymnh did it seems a lot more straightforward to me, even with the out-of-party healer. He at least went and did some back-breaking 27-hours of grinding shit to death. I rather support that than the people arround Athene...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Sorry but in my opinion you really didn't deconstruct any of my points to make a valid argument on why he should be banned and Nymh should not. It seems as though you just don't like Athene so you'd prefer to see someone else get a world first, which is fine but it doesn't make what I said any less true.</div></div><hr />

Personally I think if Blizzard are going to give achievements for world firsts the least they could do is level the playing field.

<br />
What are you -talking- about?<br />
You do not add all of the collected hours together to see how fast someone got to 80. That's like saying if you're cooking three of a specific food, and the directions are for a single one, saying &quot;Cook for 5 minutes&quot;, you need to cook the three of them for 15 minutes. Do you know what will happen with that? You'll have three burnt to a crisp pieces of food.<br />
You can not add up total hours like that, it's just dumb on all accounts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I thought the achievement was named &quot;world first to 80&quot; not &quot;most efficient way possible to world first 80&quot;. The entire point is to get there first and Athene's way took 10 hours less. Just hating for the sake of hating this looks like to me. I mean technically with that logic why not reward the first player to get to 80 entirely on rested XP. That would be UBER efficient and entirely unimpressive.</div></div><hr />

More serious though; Grats on having so good playmates that they sacrifice own leveling for other people. And to the method that god banned/reseted: People describe a method that was supposedly fixed a time ago, unless we are talking about entering same instance with multiple groups in which case the GM must simply have misunderstood the question when saying it was ok. <br />

<br />
But isn't this just another example of &quot;creative use of game mechanics&quot;, after all, he ran around for 10 levels getting all the XP while the rest of his 'group' got none.. hmm.. sounds familiar, isn't that the exact advantage Athene's group were giving Darus? He got all the XP while they got none? Ok there was more usage of the group feature in that example, more leaving/joining, but when Nymh said: &quot;I assume it will be hotfixed by Blizzard very soon&quot;, I dunno.. I just got a little angry tbh. As if he feels his method was perfectly OK and Athene exploited a bug.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd be more impressed with the first person to hit 80 who did just quests. None of this being healed by non parties stuff, or working a room that has a really fast respawn rate. If he and his healer had gotten XP, I'd be perfectly happy with that. That's how the game should be played. But I dunno, this just feels like another one of those glory records.</div></div><hr />

Athene though, he used and indoors exploit which shouldn't even work.<br />
<br />
Athene's pal got to 79 before ban and then rolled back to 70 = NOT level 80 in 13hours.<br />
Nymh did not use an exploit, did not get banned and he reached level 80 in 27hours = world first.<br />
<br />
Enough said! Nymh is simply the world first level 80.<br />
<br />
Gratz dude.<br />
<br />
[Edit]: Athene &amp; co was not entering an instance with 2 groups. there was only 5 people including Darus.<br />
First of all they enter the instance. Then Darus leaves the group and tag alot of monsters, Athene and the others who are still in the group kills the monsters and Darus gains 100% XP and all the loots. Then they invite him back again.<br />
<br />
Last time Athene did this was when he broke the world record from level 1 to 70 in 1day 2hours or something.<br />
A week after that they changed it so you didn't get any XP. And now the bug came back in the expansion it seems.<br />
That's a big exploit if you ask me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
MMO-Champion: The first level 80 was supposed to be Darus, a paladin who did some powerleveling in instances with Athene and a few other people and eventually got suspended by Blizzard at level 79. (and reseted to level 70 a few hours later) Did you hear about him ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Heh, owned.<br />
Hope they got a nice long ban for their efforts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's called griefing, and if they repeat it quite frequently you can get them banned for it.<br />
However, the blizzard GM would have to witness it in person while it's happening... which is pretty close to impossible.</div></div><hr />

My vote goes to athene... it wasnt fair as well but he was faster....<br />

the true wordfirst (for me) is someone who did it alone or in group but this isnt doable within 27h :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
in my point of view:<br />
<br />
Duras and friends was indoors leveling (instance) they where 6 ppl (first exploit) duras left grp and tagged all mobs without beeing in party and the other 5 ppl dpsed them down so duras got all the xp (second exploit) they uninvited a party member so duras didnt get teleported to his HS location (third exploit) and again they uninvited duras so the other party member they uninvited did not get teleported (same as the third exploit, so basicly, fourth exploit)<br />
<br />
and they asked a GM if it was legal or not, and if you ask a GM about that, u know its illegal..yes they got the respond &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot;, but do you all remember swifty? well he also asked a GM about his little trick, and also got: &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot; but it's still and exploit and blizz changed it as fast they could<br />
<br />
(link to swifty for those who don't know http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=26232)<br />
<br />
now, to my point of view of Nyhm<br />
<br />
Nyhm lvled outdoors..we was not in a party, but had a healer heal him when he was low on HP (no exploit, it's called friendship) Nyhm got all the XP for the kills since he tagged them and killed them on his own (can't see any exploit here) The healer got no XP for helping him (it's unfair but he did it on own free will)<br />
<br />
so basicly, no exploits for Nyhm..yes, same thing, but without exploits..<br />
<br />
so in my opinion, Nyhm is the real &quot;first to lvl 80&quot; for me..<br />
<br />
so QQ all u want Duras and friends fans, but your cheering on a cheater...</div></div><hr />

If I asked a GM if tagging mobs and having another party killing them for me is ok, and then proceed to do the above thinking that the &quot;yes&quot; from the GM is perfectly enough, then I would assume myself stupid. From reading just the GM's response there is no way of confirming that what he asked was clear enough to the GM. (They weren't simply using clever tagging, they did more)</div></div><hr />

Athene is the type of player that makes me embarassed to play wow. Sitting in his parents kitchen playing wow with his shirtless friend (lover?) shouting obsceneties and flashing a replica glock because that makes you cool apparently.<br />
<br />
Also what he did was clearly exploiting. It was considered exploiting when he did it to get the level to 70 record, and it was fixed.

<br />
2. Sure he was first to 80, but he cheated. He used a bug in the game.<br />
<br />
3. Its a big difference having a healer out-of-party, than cheating by having 6 ppl in a 5 ppl instance.<br />
<br />
4. My vote goes to Nymh. Not only because he got to lvl 80 first, wihout cheating, but when someone has to cheat his way to 80 hes pathetic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That I agree to. He was to vague in asking the question so he got a vague answer, so his own fault. As people keep saying, it was changed after he did the 1-70 way so why did he think it would be valid now?</div></div><hr />

<br />
they where 5 men in an instance--get that shit straight <br />
<br />
they used the invite an kick party functions as a way of allowing 1 member to get all the credit--the invite and kick functions are part of the game, they are nota bug, as some of you seem to think they are, and nowhere does it state that spamming invites and party kicks is a bannable offense.<br />
<br />
furthermore, they made an effort to contact a 'game master', now gms can do a multitude of things in the game, and they are in existence to maintain order. it seems perfectly logical that clearing a plan with a gm is enough information to go on.<br />
<br />
you may not approve of the methods, you don't have to.<br />
you may think athene is a fuckin tool, alot of us do.<br />
you may want to see him lose, w/e im not gonna judge you.<br />
<br />
but sweet flying fuck people, like him or not, i don't see how this is a real exploit!<br />
tagging mobs is tagging mobs whether you do it indoors or outdoors...<br />
at no point did they abuse a bug, there was no extra xp- only what the unit would normally allot to one player. <br />
there where no extra players in the instance.<br />

if anyone can come up with a reason/refute me, i am seriously impartial.<br />

shortened quote a bit!<br />
<br />
You fail to say anywhere that the exact plan was cleared with a GM, the question and answer seem vague at best to me.<br />
<br />
You seem to think that because an instance mob is tuned to give 5 players nice XP for everyone it's perfectly ok for it to give 5 times that XP just by leaving the party and tagging the mobs before the other party members do. You share the XP cause you share the work, so logically you should not get rewarded more for doing less. I bet blizzard never meant to make this possible. If it was people would have done it way more. Imagine if you could do it in a raid instance, those mobs would yield lots of experience points I'm sure...</div></div><hr />

All the GM says: You are indeed allowed to get your entire guild to help you level to 80 by mob tagging.<br />
He didn't said a word about mob tagging IN instances ...<br />
In my opinion Athene is just a bighead and a great way off being the best paladin ...<br />

Blizzard awards him 10 points, and may God have mercy on that thankless lock's soul. I know what he said. Saying a small something is about as good as nothing when you consider that this guy gets credit for world first and the other guy doesn't any achievements, let alone any experience...some random scrub is just level 71 and looks better than that healer!

<br />
Regardless of being an exploit or not it really makes you wonder &quot;What's the point?&quot;<br />
<br />
Getting to 80 and not knowing anything about mobs, quests, loot, places and lore?<br />
<br />
It sure is nice to log in and see Level 80 in there, but you tecnically have no gear, plus you dont have anyone your level to raid endgame with.<br />
<br />
Besides, being first level 80 in 13 or 27 hours (Athene and Nymh) in the world doesn't give you anything but an empty feel of self satisfaction, topped by the known fact of &quot;Now I wait for the others&quot;<br />

<br />
This is the way I get it:<br />
<br />
Nymh<br />
-I can´t find anything Illegal, Nymh didnt control both char as far as I know. The only thing might be the fast repawn rate at the location he was farming ,but how can we know that when we have never been there before? (I know it was there on Beta to, he should have asked a GM if it the respawn rate was normal tho.)<br />
-He had a healer so he didnt have to waste time on food / water, but used Life Tap insted, they where not in a party so Nymh got all the xp himself.<br />
-got to lvl 80 in 27hours.<br />
<br />
<br />
Athene (the way I got it)<br />
-He was inside an instancewith 5 people (not 6 as I thought in the beginning).<br />
-The reasons why I think he got banned is because of the Tagging and the inv then leave/kick. The inv /leave shouldnt be a prob, atleast I dont under stand why you should get banned for geting invited then leave groups XD. The tagging after WotLK was bugged / changed, because before WotLk you got xp on how much dmg you did to the mob, but now after you get full xp even if you only take 1% dmg and tag them.<br />
-got to lvl 79 in 13hours /17hours. (Im not sure)<br />
<br />
The way I see it is: Athene would have hit 80 1st if it wasnt for the ban, and Nymh would be the 2nd.<br />
We all know it was 2 GMs, one who said it was ok and noe who banned them, 1 of them most have made a mistake.<br />
The 1st GM: He said it was ok that Athene used his guild to help him get to lvl 80 by mob tagging (maybe a fan of Athene)<br />
The 2nd GM: He banned Athene for mob tagging or inv / leaving the team all the time, or maybe even both. (maybe some1 who dont like athene at all)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The way I see it Nymh thought the mobs in his area was suppost to spawn that fast, but should have asked.<br />
Athene was on the edge to get banned from who ever saw it, but should also had asked, and the GM should not ban him that fast, Athene sais &quot;wait!&quot; and was probebly going to explain what the 1st Gm had said.<br />
<br />
<br />

-got to lvl 80 in 27hours.<br />
<br />
<br />
Even if Nymh *HAD* &quot;controlled&quot; more than one character, Blizz has said NUMEROUS times that multi-boxing is 100% legit as long as the same person owns all accounts involved. For example, you could have one account, recruit-a-friend yourself a second account, recruit-a-friend yourself a 3rd account from the second, and 3-box yourself to 60 with triple XP the entire way on all 3 toons. 100% LEGIT.<br />
<br />
<br />
The bottom line here is simple: Nyhm worked really hard, his healer worked really hard, they made 80 first. Athene and his GUILD worked really hard, got caught with their hand in the cookie jar, and got stopped at 79. We know they were exploiting XP in instances, but we also know they were told it was &quot;clever use of mechanics&quot;... so until we see a Blizz Blue Post on the issue, the real question should be:<br />
&quot;What Did Athene REALLY get banned for doing?&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
Cite for this please? Seems to be working for me the same way it did in TBC and original. If you tag the mob first, you get the XP, period. If you get less XP when in a group with a higher level person it's because the XP for the mob is based on the level of the group, not the individual people.</div></div><hr />

To ppl that says Athene should be first, well he used a bug that was removed in old days after HE used it back then... Using a technique that was called a bug by blizzard years ago and that was fixed, but that got shipped back in WotLK is exploiting. He simply put up ticket till he found a GM that didn't knew about it and said it was ok. <br />

Agreed, ignorance of the law is no excuse. Something tells me that Athene wasn't really ignorant though. He was well aware after the 1-70 power level that the technique used was frowned upon and was fixed so it could no longer be used.<br />
<br />
Nymh's seems more legit for the fact that it was actually his spells that killed the mobs. Yes he had an outside healer but as someone else said it's not really an exploit just a healer being really nice.<br />
<br />
The main problem I see with Athene's group is that Darus tagged the mob and then went off to tag other mobs while others actually killed the tagged mobs. It wasn't actually Darus killing the mobs. Add in the invite and leave group mechanics used it just seems a lot cheaper and very questionable.<br />
<br />
In any event Athene is a douche (yes I know it's an act, the guy is still a douche and it's not funny.) Nymh has wasted 27 hours on something that will either people will never know about and won't even remember in 3 months (quick, without looking it up, tell me who the first to 70 was.)</div></div><hr />

Love this comment. And btw, it is an EXPLOIT, which means you use legitimate game mechanics in ways that they are NOT meant to be used. Having a healer outside group is ok, especially since Nymh killed the mobs by himself. I am disappointed tho :( (Quest leveling doesnt leave that unclean feeling ;)<br />

Blizzard awards him 10 points, and may God have mercy on that thankless lock's soul. I know what he said.

<br />
Nyhm had 1 person healing him as he dotted and killed everything. He did the majority of the work, just had a friend there probably for social and moral support, and to heal him to save down time (and tap back to full mana). Is this 'cheating', yes it can be perceived that way. Is it exploiting? No. Hell I MC Horde and heal them all the time with renew on my priest. There is no EXPLOIT in doing this. This happens a lot, or hell no one should ever ever heal anyone out of group or help them kill mobs again eh!? <br />
<br />
Like I said, cheating, maybe, but not an exploit.<br />
<br />
What Athene was doing can much more easily be considered an exploit. Why? Its toying with game mechanics more than just having a buddy follow you around and heal you. He had 4 other people helping him do his work. He helped tagged and Im sure do 20-25% of the damage on the mobs, but realistically he had 4 other people KILLING the mobs and being granted no XP for it. That seems much more likely an exploit than 1 warlock doing all the damage himself, and having a healer patch him up. <br />
<br />
Now honestly I can't say I was there either. I was in Queue on my realm until after these guys dinged lol... so its possible Nyhms healer was helping himkill things, but since it was outside an isntance Im sure that even cut into his XP, since you get XP based on the amount of damage you do in the world. In instances, I do not believe this is so, since he was able to drop group, have 4 people help him, they receive nothing and he gets full benefit. <br />
<br />
Who cheated more? They both 'cheated' to an extent, neither did it solo. Did Nyhm exploit? Not in the least that I can see. Did Athene exploit? Boarderline leaning to Yes, given he did it all in instances dropping and regrouping. Let alone, Athene would have had 'infinite' amounts of mobs just resetting the instance everytime they finished.<br />
<br />
Those are my thoughts. The 'more honest', or 'lesser of 2 evils' won this battle, and has the achievement to prove it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in my point of view:<br />
<br />
Duras and friends was indoors leveling (instance) they where 6 ppl (first exploit) duras left grp and tagged all mobs without beeing in party and the other 5 ppl dpsed them down so duras got all the xp (second exploit) they uninvited a party member so duras didnt get teleported to his HS location (third exploit) and again they uninvited duras so the other party member they uninvited did not get teleported (same as the third exploit, so basicly, fourth exploit)<br />
<br />
and they asked a GM if it was legal or not, and if you ask a GM about that, u know its illegal..yes they got the respond &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot;, but do you all remember swifty? well he also asked a GM about his little trick, and also got: &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot; but it's still and exploit and blizz changed it as fast they could<br />
<br />
(link to swifty for those who don't know http://www.warcraftmovies.com/movieview.php?id=26232)<br />
<br />
now, to my point of view of Nyhm<br />
<br />
Nyhm lvled outdoors..we was not in a party, but had a healer heal him when he was low on HP (no exploit, it's called friendship) Nyhm got all the XP for the kills since he tagged them and killed them on his own (can't see any exploit here) The healer got no XP for helping him (it's unfair but he did it on own free will)<br />
<br />
so basicly, no exploits for Nyhm..yes, same thing, but without exploits..<br />
<br />
so in my opinion, Nyhm is the real &quot;first to lvl 80&quot; for me..<br />
<br />
so QQ all u want Duras and friends fans, but your cheering on a cheater...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For Starters his name is darus not duras (who is from star trek)<br />
secondly there was not 6 people in the instance only 5<br />
so before you start spouting your BS get your facts straight</div></div><hr />

<br />
As an aside, I really don't think Blizzard should have put any of the 'first' achievements (except perhaps first kill of raid bosses). It just encourages people to do unhealthy activities. Also, those that can play Wotlk right when it comes out have an advantage (how long did it take your realm to have a first 450 skinner?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nymph - used a known game mechanic that, at most, is slightly unfair but perfectly legal. Two-boxing it with a priest on another account also would have been perfectly legal.<br />
<br />
Athene - used a known game mechanic that was beyond a doubt considered an exploit, as it was fixed in the past specifically for being an exploit, and accidentally reintroduced with WotLK.<br />

First of all... Can we say &quot;Wrath of Recycled Content&quot;?<br />
<br />
Secondly, you morons are arguing over two people that essentially used the same strategy, just different methods to attempt to reach 80 the quickest. However, what you all fail to realize, is that regardless who was partied with who, and who wasn't, is that both of the &quot;party assistance&quot; did was the same thing - generate threat.<br />
<br />
By Nymh's friend healing him (whether it was done in or out of combat, I'll play devil's advocate and assume both here), he generated threat on all of the mobs in which Nymh had &quot;tagged&quot; with his dots (Now I'm assuming he was healed in combat mainly to speed things up -- i.e. life tapping, dotting, and still moving while mobs continue to die, thus for the most part, no downtime).<br />
<br />
By Athene leaving a group after tagging the mobs, and his friends dps'ing the mobs down they did the same thing. They generated threat. Sure, the threat was generated by DPS, rather than healing, but both game mechanics generate threat, regardless.<br />
<br />
Now, let's think about this on a bigger horizon. What does threat generation do? It affects the outcome of combat. If your threat generation comes from DPS, then you're reducing the time that your said character (Athene in this case) has to sustain keeping himself alive (though I'm sure a healer was present in his case as well). If your threat generation comes from healing, you're increasing the time the character healed can sustain being alive (and in the warlocks case - increasing his DPS by consistently lifetapping). <br />
<br />
Whether they were grouped or not, all parties involved generated threat on the mobs that Nymh/Athene were tagging, so in short, they essentially did the same thing. The only difference, is that Blizzard does not penalize a character for being healed out of party by taking away an amount of experience (whether it is damage/healing done, or level based, or any other mechanic they chose to use to affect your experience gained).<br />
<br />
That being said, this argument is dumb and moot. Either neither party should have been penalized, or both parties should be, along with any other party that wishes to follow suit. Would the later be the best answer? Of course not. Just look at the bigger picture and realize both outside parties were affecting the outcome of Nymh/Athene's combat with mobs.<br />
<br />
That being said, World of Warcraft still continues to be labeled a terrible game in my book, starting shortly after the release of The Burning Crusade.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">v1ze</div><div class="date">2008-11-14, 07:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They didn't use the same tactic at all.

<br />
Perhaps you didn't realize he never told he was mob tagging IN AN INSTANCE in the message to the GM ?<br />
<br />
Think about it and stop complaining, Nyhm wins.<br />
<br />
<br />
So because Athene's exploiting was worse that makes Nyhm's exploit ok?<br />
<br />
The point for both is that they're gaining FREE XP where it's not intended by Blizzard. Therefore both would be considered an exploit.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what you're on about. You are saying that when I decide to heal a player I'm not grouped with, it's an exploit and I should be banned? That's not an exploit. It's a choice you make yourself, you're just being a very nice player. Congrats Nymh. <br />

<br />
I'm saying healing a player for 27 hours that you're CLEARLY partnered with but not starting a party to avoid the XP adjustment is an exploit. Knowingly and intentionally bypassing the XP adjustment is the EXACT same thing that Athene is doing. They were both ways of (ab)using game mechanics, as you put it. They're just going about it in a different manner.<br />
<br />
The basis for Athene's temporary ban MUST be based on his intent which therefore means Nymh is subject to the same penalties because his intent was the same.</div></div><hr />

He has screenshots of a GM on his realm confirming that there was a 0% chance he would get banned for using the mob tagging technique a different GM ended up banning him for. There is no excuse for banning him after that confirmation. <br />
<br />
Aside from that if you think about Nymh and Athene used similar exploits or &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot;. Both of them had a player or players helping them grind the mobs down outside of their party. Nymph had a player not in his party healing him as he tagged the mobs while Athene had players not in his party dps'ing the mobs instead. Theres virtually no difference as its players helping you defeat enemies while you get all the xp and they get none.<br />

<br />
They did not do the same thing. Nymh did all the damage to the mobs, where as Athene just tagged the mobs and the group killed it. *Big difference there, cause all Athene did as tag the mobs and didn't do nothing after that, he just sat there and watched his out of group party kill the mobs while getting full XP. *Threat does not play into XP gained. *Therefor threat has no play in this argument. <br />
<br />
Why is it a bug? Because hes getting full XP for just tagging them. *If he did it outside of the instance it he would get like 2 xp cause all he did was tag it. *Now lemme ask you, why do you get reduced xp for just tagging outside of an instance, but you get full xp for the instance? *Cause it's an exploit, and it has already been fixed prior to Wotlk. *It just happen to re-surface into wotlk.<br />
<br />
Now why did he do it when this bug re-surfaced? because he thought blizzard was going to honor this bug again like they did when he went from 1-70. *Obviously not smart; if blizzard fixed it already it means its an exploit, but he went ahead and did it anyways. regardless of the GM told them; blizzard &quot;FIXED&quot; the bug previously therefor making this bug an exploit. *Did the GM know they we're going to use the instance bug? No. Why did i assume the GM didn't know about the instance bug in wotlk? because it was supposedly fixed.* Second if the GM knew about the instance bug that resurfaced, he/she would have told them no you can't do that because it was fixed previously there for an exploit.* After that the GM would have contacted blizzard about the bug and blizzard would either keep an eye out for players exploiting the bug and give the players warnings, or blizzard would have attempted to patch the system so it can not be abused. Now if blizzard knew about the exploit it wouldn't have taken 13 hours to take action.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Chezzik</div><div class="date">2008-11-14, 10:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So because Athene's exploiting was worse that makes Nyhm's exploit ok?<br />
<br />
The point for both is that they're gaining FREE XP where it's not intended by Blizzard. Therefore both would be considered an exploit.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, they're not at all the same.<br />
<br />
If you've been around for a while, you'll remember many patches where Blizzard has adjusted how the xp is divided, but one thing has always stayed constant:<br />
If 100% of the dmg is done by people in the group, then 100% of the xp goes to the group.<br />
<br />
The bolded statement above has always been true. What has changed over time is the scope of &quot;group&quot;: <br />
<br />
At first, pets were not included, and hunters/warlocks were often receiving less xp that others. That was fixed early. Now pets are considered part of the group of their owner as long as the owner does at least one hit on the XP-bearing mob.<br />
<br />
Next, it came out that &quot;Thorns&quot; by druids were not considered group members. Any dmg done by thorns would reduce XP. Blizzard did not change this.<br />
<br />
After BC, warriors received &quot;Spell Reflect&quot;. It was discovered that spell reflect damage was caused by a shield, which was not considered a group member. It reduced XP for the warriors.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometime after the Spell Reflect issue came to light, some players discovered that grouping and ungrouping in instances was different than outside instances. It allowed people to receive credit for damage caused by players who were not party members. Most of these people calmly reported the bug to Blizzard, but once Athene learned of it, he started exploiting, and making videos with outrageous claims. The fact that he took credit for finding a bug that was already known really angered many players, and his videos touting his exploitation of the system were so bad they were almost unwatchable, yet he managed to gain a small (but vocal) following.<br />
<br />
Nymph, however, did all the damage required to gain enough xp to get from 60 to 70. Blizzard has always maintained that healing a target who in turn kills an xp-carrying mob does not count for the XP calculations. Dmg is the only thing that is considered for the xp calculations, so you won't lose any XP due to another player who ran by you and placed a HOT on your head.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nobby42</div><div class="date">2008-11-14, 10:25 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Powerleveling like Athene &amp; co did is indeed an exploit.<br />
But Nymh's way of powerleveling is not. Because the priest only healed him outdoors,<br />
Athene though, he used and indoors exploit which shouldn't even work.<br />
<br />
Athene's pal got to 79 before ban and then rolled back to 70 = NOT level 80 in 13hours.<br />
Nymh did not use an exploit, did not get banned and he reached level 80 in 27hours = world first.<br />
<br />
Enough said! Nymh is simply the world first level 80.<br />
<br />
Gratz dude.<br />
<br />
[Edit]: Athene &amp; co was not entering an instance with 2 groups. there was only 5 people including Darus.<br />
First of all they enter the instance. Then Darus leaves the group and tag alot of monsters, Athene and the others who are still in the group kills the monsters and Darus gains 100% XP and all the loots. Then they invite him back again.<br />
<br />
Last time Athene did this was when he broke the world record from level 1 to 70 in 1day 2hours or something.<br />
A week after that they changed it so you didn't get any XP. And now the bug came back in the expansion it seems.<br />
That's a big exploit if you ask me.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow. Thanks. That sounds like a real exploit to me and I think blizz did the right thing by not awarding Athene world first.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Accalon</div><div class="date">2008-11-14, 10:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">He didn't just tag mobs, he cheated in an instance to, where there is a bug. He got banned for a reason. Don't give him so much credit.<br />
<br />
<br />
I still don't see how that is cheating? This is like the multi-box argument. People complaining that clever use of game mechanics is &quot;broken&quot;. Who gives a flying rip that he used a way to get quicker experience, I guess he is just much more competitive than you all.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AHA...and here it comes.<br />
Guys remember the french dude who got 70 first when BC was released?<br />
He OPENLY admitted he had his guild help him kill mobs which HE tagged.<br />
All he did was attack each mob and then move on to the next, lettin the guild kill the mobs for him, giving him full xp since the mobs arent gray.<br />
Just google it, or search mmo-champion database...they got an interview.<br />
<br />
Did he get punished? No...<br />
<br />
Now the question should more be asked like this...<br />
Did Athene's group exploit something else they neglected to mention to us? Giving them that suspension and reset?<br />
I mean...they even asked a GM if their way of lvling was legit and got the response &quot;Clever use of game mechanics&quot;...Double moral much blizzard? So sad...<br />
<br />
In any case...imho, they were the first...not this nymf or whatever it's spelled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nymph or Nymf got destroyed to 80 btw, I totally agree.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You made a point and countered it in the same paragraph. You stated the purpose of healing a target not being involved for XP calculations is so you won't lose any XP due to another player healing you who is just running by. Therefore Nymph, knowing this, used this fact to gain full XP while essentially playing in a group of 2. If they were in a party, he would be losing XP even if the healer does ZERO damage. So you first say that the rule exists to prevent unintended XP loss and then state using this rule intentionally isn't exploiting the purpose of the rule. Which is it?<br />
<br />
For his situation, healing is just as important to his success as damage yet doesn't have the drawback of losing XP. It allows him to maintain his mana bar and reduce the time it takes to kill mobs. He can put 2 DoT's on a mob and move on to the next without giving a second thought to the mobs attacking him. He's almost playing with god mode on, infinite mana and hp, yet isn't considered exploiting?</div></div><hr />

I think Athene clearly did use a known exploit that was accidentally reintroduced and found a GM who didn't know much. I'm not going to put blame on a GM. New GMs get hired all the time and they won't know every single detail about the game.<br />
<br />
Athee may whine as much as he wants to but it won't matter. Nymh did it with hard work and rightfully earned the title of World first.<br />

If you want to see how he really behaves, watch &quot;IPower&quot; clips where they talk about random &quot;important issues&quot;.<br />

He doesn't really treat that girl like that.. it's for the series. They're all just friends somewhere in Europe trolling retards (that think he's serious) and providing sometimes funny, sometimes not, entertainment for those who care.<br />

Also, congratulations to the both of them. I think it's impressive both ways.. but I also consider Athene to be better at power-leveling.<br />

Go to www.worldofathene.com<br />
<br />
They have a 30 minute video explaining how they did it so fast.<br />

Also, stop whining about people being good at games being &quot;losers.&quot; Nymph says he's employed and Athene and them are extremely successful on the internet doing what they love to do.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clockmort</div><div class="date">2008-11-15, 12:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">They did not do the same thing. Nymh did all the damage to the mobs, where as Athene just tagged the mobs and the group killed it. Big difference there, cause all Athene did as tag the mobs and didn't do nothing after that, he just sat there and watched his out of group party kill the mobs while getting full XP. Threat does not play into XP gained. Therefor threat has no play in this argument. <br />
<br />
Why is it a bug? Because hes getting full XP for just tagging them. If he did it outside of the instance it he would get like 2 xp cause all he did was tag it. Now lemme ask you, why do you get reduced xp for just tagging outside of an instance, but you get full xp for the instance? Cause it's an exploit, and it has already been fixed prior to Wotlk. It just happen to re-surface into wotlk.<br />
<br />
Now why did he do it when this bug re-surfaced? because he thought blizzard was going to honor this bug again like they did when he went from 1-70. Obviously not smart; if blizzard fixed it already it means its an exploit, but he went ahead and did it anyways. regardless of the GM told them; blizzard &quot;FIXED&quot; the bug previously therefor making this bug an exploit. Did the GM know they we're going to use the instance bug? No. Why did i assume the GM didn't know about the instance bug in wotlk? because it was supposedly fixed. Second if the GM knew about the instance bug that resurfaced, he/she would have told them no you can't do that because it was fixed previously there for an exploit. After that the GM would have contacted blizzard about the bug and blizzard would either keep an eye out for players exploiting the bug and give the players warnings, or blizzard would have attempted to patch the system so it can not be abused. Now if blizzard knew about the exploit it wouldn't have taken 13 hours to take action.<br />
<br />
<br />
How you all cry &quot;bug&quot; is beyond me. There is no bug to it. Nothing was broken. Simply put, they changed the mechanic in which experience is gained. The big picture is about threat generation really, and you fail to see it Liguid. Healing generates threat. Damage generates threat. What does threat generation do? I'll repeat it for you -- it affects the outcome of a battle. They are the exact same thing if you take a look at the bigger picture. <br />
<br />
Nymh's healer friend affected the outcome of his combat by healing him while he is chain pulling mobs. Athene's party of guildmates affected the outcome of his combat by either healing him (assumed so, because you're probably not going to down elite mobs quickly without a healer), and dealing damage to said mobs. It's a simple concept called &quot;Tap-Leveling&quot; and was used for a the longest time. Player A Taps Mob, Player(s) B (C,D, etc.) damage Mob, or Heal Player A.<br />
<br />
If you can't fail to see it this way, here's another way.<br />
<br />
Nymh Taps Mobs A, B, C, and D with Curse of Agony and Corruption. As their life is dwindling away, Nymh starts to lifetap to regain the mana he used. Nymh's friend starts to heal Nymh, thus has been added to the threat tables of Mobs A, B, C, and D.<br />
<br />
Athene Taps Mobs A, B, C and D in an instance. Athene drops group, and is healed by Player A. Player A is added to the threat tables of Mobs A, B, C and D. Players B, C, and D deal damage to mobs A, B, C, and D (probably done by focus firing them down one by one) Players B, C, D are added to the threat tables of Mobs A, B, C, and D.<br />
<br />
What is different here? Nymh performed a tap-leveling concept in a world environment, while Athene performed a tap-leveling concept in a private environment, known as an instance dungeon. Is anything else different than that? Absolutely not.<br />
<br />
People can't continue to argue &quot;Who's Right and Who's Wrong&quot;, but that's not what it's about. It's about &quot;WHAT is right and WHAT is wrong&quot;. Frankly, Blizzard needs to get their double standards in check.</div></div><hr />

Same, a friend from the Beta said that there are quests that take you through this area.<br />
My guess, barring confirmation either way, is that it was not hotfixed, but instead requires you to be on a quest for them to either drop loot or give xp. Nymh probably started the quest and never turned it in. Again, IF my theory is correct. No data on Wowhead, Thottbot or Allakhazam. /sigh</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">The Man</div><div class="date">2008-11-15, 01:35 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It was only because of this golden post I happened upon that I had any desire to join this argument, as it wraps up pretty much every anti-Athene argument there is into one concise, objective, coherent and grammatically flawless essay that radiates apparent intelligence on the part of the author.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
okey..let me get this straight for you..<br />
<br />
in my point of view:<br />
<br />
Duras and friends was indoors leveling (instance) they where 6 ppl (first exploit)<br />
<br />
Lets stop there for now. Before we continue, lets make sure all readers can count up to the number 5. As common sense is rampantly becoming less and less common- (if you think this is ironic, just wait! There's more) - we must take great pains to ensure that all members of the argument are up to speed with the fact that there were only 5 people in the instance. <br />
<br />
First exploit: refuted.<br />
<br />
Lets continue <br />
<br />
<br />
duras left grp and tagged all mobs without beeing in party and the other 5 ppl dpsed them down so duras got all the xp (second exploit)<br />
<br />
I can imagine how difficult it is for you Nymph fan boys to admit just how similar Athene and Nymphs methods were, as almost your entire shaky argument is built upon this foundation. Let me outline the differences as slowly and accessibly as I can manage.<br />
<br />
Athene tagged mobs, out of party, before allowing the rest of his group to help him, in order to gain 100% experience while his group gained zilch.<br />
<br />
I hope I can now reasonably expect everyone to understand this concept. <br />
<br />
Nymph tagged mobs, out of party, before allowing his 'group' to help him, in order to gain 100% experience while his group gained zilch.<br />
<br />
POP QUIZ: What is similar about these two methods?<br />
ANSWER: EVERYTHING, except the names and locations.<br />
<br />
If the bolded and underlined phrases did not beat you over the head enough and make this obvious point any more obvious, and you STILL managed to get the wrong answer, please report yourself to the nearest cave, crawl in it, and die. You are not fit to reproduce. I need not explain why. If you refuse to comply, Darwin's theory of evolution will catch up with you eventually, God willing.<br />
<br />
Second exploit: refuted.<br />
<br />
<br />
they uninvited a party member so duras didnt get teleported to his HS location (third exploit) and again they uninvited duras so the other party member they uninvited did not get teleported (same as the third exploit, so basicly, fourth exploit)<br />
<br />
I don't know about the rest of you, but what I got from this part of his argument is basically a repeat of his first argument; &quot;Thou shalt not have 6 people in your group for an instance, by any means sneaky, underhand, or otherwise unwholesome and inappropriate for children.&quot; As all those who can count past the number 5 (see above) can attest to, there wasn't actually 6 people in the group, <br />
therefore...<br />
<br />
Third and Forth exploit: refuted.<br />
<br />
<br />
and they asked a GM if it was legal or not, and if you ask a GM about that, u know its illegal..yes they got the respond &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot;, but do you all remember swifty? well he also asked a GM about his little trick, and also got: &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot; but it's still and exploit and blizz changed it as fast they could<br />
<br />
To be honest, this took me more than a minute to properly translate. To think we have degenerated so far as humans as to have to translate our own language... but I digress. <br />
I believe the point that the poster is making, is that if you ask whether or not something is ok to do before doing it, then that must mean 'u know its illegal'.<br />
<br />
We could argue over how true that point is, but just let me refer you to a simple analogy I created, for your benefit. Maybe this will clear things up.<br />
<br />
<br />
Example 1A: Boy sees cookies on counter, boy takes a cookie, boy gets his ass beat by Mom and gets banned from Wow<br />
Example 1B: Athene sees advantage in leveling technique, Athene uses advantage to level to 80 fast, Athene gets his ass beat and banned from WoW<br />
<br />
Fair enough, however, a cookie goes to whoever spots the discrepancy here:<br />
<br />
Example 2A: Boy sees cookies on counter, boy asks Mom if it's ok to have a cookie, Mom says yes, boy eats cookie, everyone wins.<br />
Example 2B: Athene sees advantage in leveling technique, Athene asks GM if it's ok to use, GM says yes, Athene uses advantage to level to 80 fast, Athene gets his ass beat and banned from WoW<br />
<br />
I spotted the discrepancy first by italicizing it, cookie goes to me. 8)<br />
Athene was attempting to remove the possibility of being banned by making sure it was ok first. This does not imply that he knew his actions were illegal. He just didn't want to get his ass beat.<br />
<br />
And now, The Academy Award for Irony goes to:<br />
<br />
Nyhm lvled outdoors..we was not in a party, but had a healer heal him when he was low on HP (no exploit, it's called friendship) Nyhm got all the XP for the kills since he tagged them and killed them on his own (can't see any exploit here) The healer got no XP for helping him (it's unfair but he did it on own free will)<br />
so basicly, no exploits for Nyhm..yes, same thing, but without exploits..<br />
<br />
<br />
This quote is an entirely new type of verbal irony (which I coined myself); Stupirony: &quot;a figure of speech in which what is said is the opposite of what is meant (dictionary.com)... while the speaker manages to be blissfully unaware of how contradictory the argument is to him/herself.&quot;<br />
<br />
For the slow: he &quot;basicly&quot; contradicted himself by accusing Athene of the exact same things he praises Nymph for. All the while managing, I assume, to keep a straight face. Therefore, he has used the figure of speech, Stupirony. The stupid use of irony.<br />
<br />
To finish this argument, I'm going to paraphrase you:<br />
<br />
Athene had partners that healed when he was low on HP and helped him kill guys (no exploit, it's called friendship)<br />
Athene got all the XP for the kills since he tagged them and killed them on his own (can't see any exploit here)<br />
Athene's party got no XP for helping him (it's unfair but they did it on their own free will)<br />
So &quot;basicly&quot;, no exploits for Athene... yes, same thing as Nymph, but without exploits.<br />
<br />
&lt;/thread&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong. There was dps from the rest of the party. Athene was not the only one doing damage while 4 others healed him. If you believe that Athene did all the dps on his own then I have a couple bridges to sell you.<br />
<br />
The GM was asked in advance because Athene had a hunch there would be bugs in the expansion.......bugs that the GM probably thought were fixed (from the last time Athene exploited the game.) Mob tagging would not have been a perceived problem to the GM, that is why he gave the go ahead. The GM did nothing wrong. <br />

Athene took the risk and got slapped down for it.<br />

Athene was attempting to remove the possibility of being banned by making sure it was ok first. This does not imply that he knew his actions were illegal. He just didn't want to get his ass beat.<br />
<br />
..........<br />
<br />
Athene had partners that healed when he was low on HP and helped him kill guys (no exploit, it's called friendship)<br />
Athene got all the XP for the kills since he tagged them and killed them on his own (can't see any exploit here)<br />
Athene's party got no XP for helping him (it's unfair but they did it on their own free will)<br />
So &quot;basicly&quot;, no exploits for Athene... yes, same thing as Nymph, but without exploits.<br />
<br />
&lt;/thread&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
First, the scenario is more like this. Little boy wants a cookie before dinner, he knows his mom will not allow it so he does not ask her. Boy gets lucky when mom has to go to the work for emergency so senile Aunt Betty has to watch him for a few hours. Boy waits til mom leaves and asks Aunt Betty if he can have a cookie which of course she says whatever dear. Boy's mom gets home, finds out he ate a cookie when he knew it was wrong and beats his a$$.<br />
<br />
Also, as has been stated no they are not the same thing. One person simply tagged mobbed and touched himself while other people healed him and killed mobs. The other killed the mobs all by himself and had a healer keep him from dying.<br />
<br />
Note, personally I think both are &quot;cheaters&quot; but they are not the same thing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From Darus himself:<br />
<br />
well i think, that the mob tagging was legit. The reason why we got suspended might have been exploiting teleportation timer by leaving/rejoining. But im not sure its hardly like ive gotten an explanation =P<br />

The mobs respawned faster than intended -&gt; exploit. Rollback to L70 deserved.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Forumchibi</div><div class="date">2008-11-15, 04:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hah all who are saying Nymh used some exploit can just drop dead. He did all the work = killed those mobs. So what if he had a healer out of group? Out of group healing isn't an exploit. It isn't even a cheat.<br />
<br />
A) Nymh tags mob, does dps, mobs die, Nymh gets the XP. Healing wont kill mobs.<br />
<br />
Athene version is to exploit instance XP. XP is increased cause it's divided among 5 players, normally. Athene (or whoever was getting) got all the XP alone with this group leaving and rejoining.<br />
<br />
B) Athene tags mob, leaves party, rest of the party kills mobs, Athene gets 5 times the XP he should and he gets it alone.<br />
<br />
It's completely different to use out of group healer than out of group dps and/or healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can't have it one way and not the other. Nymh had outside assistance just like Athene did. If his friend was doing damage rather than just healing, he'd be just as guilty to you. How is it fair that he had extra survivability and zero downtime through heals, but if someone had been killing things it's wrong? It's a slower process, obviously, but it's still the same situation with the exact same result - you're still &quot;exploiting&quot; the fact that you can get fast experience solo, but with outside assistance. If he had had 4 people instead of 1 healing him against 5 times as many mobs because he can just DoT as much as he wants without a care in the world, and even mobs of a higher level, would that still be fair?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devidose</div><div class="date">2008-11-15, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just a point; If the method is using tabs in an instance, the person tagging would tag them solo, then have the group kill them, then rejoin the group. Otherwise:<br />
<br />
1: Tagging in a group means all the group benefits from rewards.<br />
2: Wait too long, get removed from instance. However it seems this wasnt WAI? Given it was something implemented after Athene did this previously, supposedly (There have been similar things when someone manages something due to loopholes: Azuregos solo kill by a Hunter in Resto Shaman gear for example). Due to this mechanism not working properly, this can be considered an exploit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlock was attacking outside non elite mobs, this gives 100% XP to a solo player.<br />
Athene was tagging mobs inside a 5 man instance, using a broken game mechanic, that it looks like they are the original cause of in the first place, to tag a mob, have a group supply the damage to take down 5M elites, resulting in boosted XP. This is so people still have a steady XP gain while doing instances. The XP gained from these elites is not meant for solo players, as it was received here.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Danjo</div><div class="date">2008-11-15, 05:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally i think the main question here is<br />
What is an exploit.<br />
In my opinion that is something they will fix in an upcomming patch.<br />
So if they will fix this &quot;problem&quot; it means it was fixed because it could be and in this case was exploited.<br />
<br />
Then on Athene's part he definatly made smart use of game mechanics. <br />
He asked a GM and got his approval which means BLIZZ approves.<br />
Blizz is responsible for the GM's.<br />
But i do think he made use of an exploit.<br />
His quick lvling 1-70 was that higher lvl chars cant help you. <br />
This time he got help from lower lvl'ed chars. Which would mean something totally different.<br />
<br />
So the only way to get a straight awnser on who is world first 80 is to see if they wil fix the way Nymh did it and the way Athene's team did it.<br />
If both got exploits Athene's team wins or the first who didn't use any exploit.<br />
<br />
That's the only question you should be asking yourself/blizz<br />
The rest is subjective speculation.<br />
<br />
So which one will they fix. <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, i'd like to enforce what others have commented on the healer. <br />
Didn't got the credit he/she deserved. I think that was a bigger achievement. Seeing someone lvl so easy to 80 while you get 0. Great teamspirit!</div></div><hr />

Blizzard laugh in your faces for not doing the same thing. It's clever use of mechanics. Sure one player is getting faster to L80, but it's not a whole group getting faster to 80. So who cares? <br />
<br />
Why Athene &amp; co got roll backed to 70 was because they used an exploit to reset the instance faster than intended.</div></div><hr />

Nymh did all the damage to the mobs, where as Athene just tagged the mobs and the group killed it. Big difference there, cause all Athene did as tag the mobs and didn't do nothing after that, he just sat there and watched his out of group party kill the mobs while getting full XP. Threat does not play into XP gained. Therefor threat has no play in this argument. <br />
<br />
Why is it a bug? Because hes getting full XP for just tagging them. If he did it outside of the instance it he would get like 2 xp cause all he did was tag it. Now lemme ask you, why do you get reduced xp for just tagging outside of an instance, but you get full xp for the instance? Cause it's an exploit, and it has already been fixed prior to Wotlk. It just happen to re-surface into wotlk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly if you dont know what you are talkin about you shouldnt be posting..<br />
<br />
1st of all, take 30 mins of your time to watch the video on how Athene got from 70 to 79.<br />
<br />
In the video He explains how the XP is gained by Mob-targeting, he says that the XP u gained by mob-targeting is based on the DMG u do to them, if u just hit them once and your party kill them u dont gain that much XP, He gemed his gear and enchanted his gear to &quot;increase&quot; his DPS to the mobs, he also points that both pallies had Ret aura to Increase his dps, he also used flasks, oils, food, symbols,drums,buffs to Increase the dmg he was doing to the mobs, he also said he had a &quot;wierd&quot; spec to do more dmg.<br />
<br />
For those who say that Nymh did a hard work to get to 80 in 27 hours and athene did nothing but mob-targetin u all wrong, they both tried hard but in dif ways, athene did a research of what mobs/instances gave him the most XP wich instances were faster blah blah blah, that seems easy but try to do it urself and realize that takes more time than just dot dot dot life tap dot run dot dot life tap for 27 hours.. <br />
<br />
To me Athene got the World first even tho he got banned while he was working out to hit 80..<br />
<br />
Take a look at the video he did and see what they did to make this happend... Its pretty impresive how they did it. http://www.worldofathene.com/records.php<br />
<br />
Athene friends Helped him to keep him alive and dps down the mobs wich they were elite and def not soloable.<br />
Nymh's Healer kept him in a god mode with full mana and full hp so he could dot all the mobs and never worried about anything.<br />
<br />
They both the same, the only dif is the name and how they did it<br />
<br />
&quot;At the end of the day its just a game and you dont own anything, Blizzard owns everything&quot;</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eneq</div><div class="date">2008-11-15, 06:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think we need to clarify the methods used, some already have tried to do so but lets do it again :)<br />
<br />
Method 1: Mob Tagging<br />
This is simply getting ownership of the kill while you are getting help from other players who dont get any gains from it. There is a slight difference in methods used to do this depending a lot on what kind of assistance one has, if one look at Nymh it feels he is doing most of the work himself but frankly thats just another way of saying that healers isnt important..<br />
<br />
Darius (Athene was not the one being leveled so stop saying Athene dammit), did only what was already done in the first to lvl70 scenario. Tagging mobs and having other players kill them, this method has been used for powerleveling a long long long time and has not been considered an exploit before.<br />
<br />
Method 2: Join/Rejoin group<br />
The bad thing about mob tagging is that you eventually run out of mobs so the downtime is an issue, now if this can be done in an instance where the clearing time allows for reset the whole time there would be no downtime (or you could use a forever respawning mob but thats more of an exploit imo).<br />
<br />
To do this however the tagger needs to be out of group and run into the teleportation scenario, but this isnt an issue as long as he rejoins before the time is up.<br />
<br />
Conclusion<br />
Is this an exploit scenario? I wouldnt think of it as such, its a clever combination of two separate game mechanics to reach a goal. Neither of these are exploits atm (although it would be fun to see them remove mob tagging altogether). <br />
<br />
I applaud Team Darius of their cleverness to come up with this method I only wished that you had continued submitting tickets overtime so you could have more GMs looking at it and being part of the GM side discussion. I assume they expected to be given a chance to respond before being banned but no such luck.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Eneq</div><div class="date">2008-11-16, 01:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I kind of disagree, if one compares this usage of the group mechanics to using an never ending respawn mob id consider the latter a bigger exploit.<br />
<br />
The join/leave method combined with tagging is ofcourse a missed scenario from the game developers but its there with the intent of buffering incase of mistakes so that buffer is an intended game mechanic. Never ending mob spawn is definitely NOT an intended game mechanic and thus would be def. classified as an exploit.<br />
<br />
Any case, I myself think that experienced earned outside of a group in an instance should be 0 (easy fix) and I also think that mob tagging should be removed xp should be earned on a damage ratio based on the damage done to the mob as well as the healing effort on any player part of the &quot;damage list&quot; for that mob and not tied into a group mechanic.<br />
<br />
ONLY when these powerleveling features has been adress will we ever see a TRUE leveling achievement.<br />

<br />
It's simple for the fact that Athene/Darus actually went to Blizzard to ask. In other words, he was warned about it previously and most likely told that they didn't want that kind of structure/leveling in the game. Why do you think he actually went to Blizz to ask? If he was completely sure, he would not have asked.<br />
<br />
He knew was doing something sketchy and most likely an exploit of the system, yet he did it anyways. Granted he did say he talked to a gm, but then he may have talked to 5 also and 4/5 said he couldn't but he went with the one who said it was okay. On that we'll never truly know, only that he now has his toon back.<br />
<br />
My question still stands though, I wonder how fast either Darus/Athene or Nymh could go if they had ZERO outside help. Those that have leveled up solo, without a pocket healer or use of exploitive, or clever use of game mechanics are the true powerlevelers and the ones that truly deserve the world firsts IMO.<br />
<br />
So I ask again, how fast did someone get to level 70 with realistically no outside help.</div></div><hr />

That is ONE group. Ever tried to enter the same dungeon with two different groups? What happens then is intended behaviour and everybody knows that :)<br />
<br />
Hmmm, well I wouldnt agree to this statement. The purpose of the instance is to set aside a game environment specifically designed to be handled by multiple players without having the gameworld issues with player competition. The complexity of the instance thus specify how many players are allowed inside it. <br />
<br />
IMO the number of players and separate environment is the key items here, now ofcourse Blizzard tied this into the group concept but thats more of a implementation solution that allows easier handling of the group mechanics (targetting etc etc).<br />
<br />
Also I am a bit vary of the multiple group statement in your comment, ofcourse by leaving the group Darus ends up in a &quot;world group&quot; or whatever one would call it but at no point where there more than the allowed number of players for the instance ie. 5.<br />
<br />
Anyway, no point arguing it all comes down to matter of opinion and I wouldnt be surprised if this was debated extensively within the GM community as well.<br />

Technically Darus was the world first. If you get technical and take into account either the athene team NOT getting banned and dinging 80 10 hours before Nymh, or banning Nymh the same amount of time.<br />

Out of group dps is wrong, it kills your targets a lot faster = faster exp.<br />
Out of group healing is totally fine, your target wont die any faster = the usual exp.<br />

No healing, you die instead of your target = no xp. WoW is retarded for making that kind of artificial qualification for experience.<br />

Bah. The REAL world's fist level 80 was the guy who did it all by himself without lame exploits.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Undisciplined</div><div class="date">2008-11-23, 01:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Been reading a load of posts, why does everybody think it was Athene that was the exploit leveller in that group? It was Darus the prot paladin. Athene was the healer in that 5 man group, getting no xp. So athene has nothing to do with getting to 80 first except that he helped Darus.<br />
<br />
As for what Darus/Athene did, calling it an &quot;exploit&quot; is debatable. Athene himself conversed with a GM BEFORE they started levelling, and this first GM said it was ok, and that it is allowed and is just a clever way of levelling. This means, that it is not &quot;cheating&quot;. After 15 hours, moments from when Darus was about to ding 80, a GM halted a boss fight (unless im mistaken) and explained how they will be banned, and without even letting them reply, banned them then and there.<br />
<br />
Athene has posted a video on Youtube explaining EVERYTHING. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibSWooWOiO0 <br />
<br />
IF Darus was allowed to ding 80, he would have been Level 80 in 15 hours, compared to Nymh's 27 hours.<br />
<br />
This subject is debatable and will be for all time. As Athene even points out in the video, in the end of the day, this means nothing and noone cares, even Darus, who I have personally talked to, doesnt care. At the end of the day Blizzard, as it is very nearly written in their Terms of Service, own you, they do not even have to legally give a reason why they ban you.<br />
<br />
So all in all, unlucky to Darus, Athene, Airbombas, Meatloaf and Slö for their efforts being in vain, but still doing an excellent job. And congratulations to Nymh for technically being the first level 80 in 27 hours.</div></div><hr />

I would have to say there are a lot of Athene haters out there but never the less there are some points I would like to make.<br />
<br />
1.The character Athene portrayed by the Ipower crowd is just that (ITS A TONGUE IN CHEEK LOOK AT PRO-GAMING WITH WoW AS ITS FOCUS)<br />
<br />
2.Both Athene and Nymh attempted the record with methods considered by Blizzards T&amp;C's to be exploiting the game hence by dictionary definition exploits were used by both characters.<br />
<br />
3.There was only 5 people in Athenes group not 6 as is constantly repeated in this thread you wouldnt see the sixth person in the instance.<br />
<br />
4.The Character that was been leveled by the team organised by Athene was Darus.<br />
<br />
5.Athenes team was clearly in the lead by at least a 10hour margin<br />
<br />
6.The fact that you flame Athene whilst congratulating Nyhm shows you are not impartial and cant even understand the basic principle of exploiting the game.<br />
<br />
7.Who currently holds fastest 1-60 1-70 60-70 world records thats right youve guessed its Athene<br />
<br />
8.Who will hold the world record for 1-80 my guess is Athene<br />
<br />
9.Why do people insist on flaming Athene when he clearly demonstrates a more indepth knowledge of the game and its mechanics that half of you guys put together without this he wouldnt have been able to achieved what he has.<br />
<br />
10.Quite simply put he is Merciless Gladiator Athene the best paladin in the world!<br />
<br />
11.This is for all you Yanks out there we do not give a toss what you think.Btw its not American english its just english that you cant spell<br />
<br />
And on a final note I take it none of you have ever helped a character that has allready tagged a mob to down it quicker because they are having trouble dropping it nah didnt think so<br />
<br />
Wanna know why they really banned him?<br />
<br />
Cause he lvls to 80 faster than their GMs can type /set 80!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Warlock was attacking outside non elite mobs, this gives 100% XP to a solo player.<br />
Athene was tagging mobs inside a 5 man instance, using a broken game mechanic, that it looks like they are the original cause of in the first place, to tag a mob, have a group supply the damage to take down 5M elites, resulting in boosted XP. This is so people still have a steady XP gain while doing instances. The XP gained from these elites is not meant for solo players, as it was received here.<br />

What are they going to do other than brag, i got to 80 first? there is no real point and this is a GAME, not a contest. If you people think they deserve props for finding the biggest exploit without getting banned or finding some sad fuck to help them for no reason other than wanting him to be first, is retarded. <br />
<br />
Level as you please, have fun with the game, hell just live. Grinding mobs for 27 hours straight is not leveling, its mindless, and if you think it means they are better than us, then i fear for the worlds survival.<br />

Anyway, just to add a point, if you're trying to call Nymph's approach an exploit (Which really, it isn't, but hey) i just went over to where he levelled on a crappy geared 70 lock, and noticed you could do the entire thing over and over as a lock without a healer at all, and virtually no down time. Anthene certainly could not do what they did with one player, while with Nymph's approach, you could. Makes me wonder why he didn't. <br />

You get it wrong. THey have Darus in a 5 man party, when he pulls the mobs he leaves the party, leaving them with 4 players in the party. He tags them alone and they DPS them. He then joins again so he dosent get booted from the instance.</div></div><hr />

That's the one I thought it was. That's obviously who leveling guides think it is too, because I keep seeing them use his Blood Elf character in their advertisements. The one that got to 80 was a female Human though, so I'm stumped :( The movie-maker Nymh doesn't seem like he'd be hardcore enough to try and get to 80 first, but that's just my thought.</div></div><hr />

1. The video was made by Nyhm not Nymh.<br />
2. The PL guild was not done by Nyhm there using his name and the look with out asking him, and he can do nothing because the name is not copy righted.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xinzo</div><div class="date">2008-12-07, 02:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Clearly there are some people that do not quite understand how mobtagging works.<br />
<br />
Nymh did NOT use mobtagging, while on the other hand; Darus did.<br />
<br />
~Mobtagging<br />
a cleaver use of game mechanics, allowing a player to hit a target first, to let it get killed by another player/players.. the first attacker gets the loot + a part of the xp (hence the term &quot;tagging&quot;), the person/people that killed the mob, also get a share of the xp, but no loot.<br />
<br />
Athene TEAM went into instances, they had a team of 5 people, Darus (the person being powerlvl'd), 3x dps and a paladin healer (Athene)<br />
What they did is: every time they engaged a pack of mobs, they kicked Darus from the group, allowing him to &quot;tag&quot; the mobs and the party would kill them. Then Darus would get invited back in the group, to prevent teleportation to the hearthstone's location.<br />
<br />
This is clearly different to the way Nymh leveled. he killed the mobs on his own. the healer was just there so Nymh could run around endlessly because of lifetap and dots, never oom + never low health.<br />
<br />
..either way, both can be interpreted as exploitation of game mechanics, or cleaver use of them.<br />
The fact remains, blizzard found Darus leveling way too fast, and got scared that the wow community might got disturbed by Athene TEAM and open a flamewar on the wowforums.<br />
The funny part about this all is. whenever a GM says that something is allowed, and a minute later after you executed whatever you wanted to do, a GM can ban you for which he just gave you permission to do. They will still be in their rights, since you agreed to the ToU and EULA. hell, they could even ban you because they felt like it, and still win the fight in court.<br />
<br />
So whether it was fair, or not fair.. or cheating/exploiting, or not.<br />
Athene TEAM technically could have became level 80 10 hours faster.<br />
<br />
<br />
just my 2cents.<br />

A few flawed statements there. Only the one tagging the mob get's exp, anyone not in the taggers party doesn't get anything.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">aiggan</div><div class="date">2008-12-11, 01:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Out of group healing isn't an exploit. It happens in Wow every single day. You could call it a friendly gesture, friendship or something. If I solo quests and aggro more mobs that I can handle, some random healer comes by and throws me some hots or something. Does that make me a cheater then? Obviously not.<br />
<br />
Out of group dps is wrong, it kills your targets a lot faster = faster exp.<br />
Out of group healing is totally fine, your target wont die any faster = the usual exp.<br />
<br />
<br />
I wouldn't call you a cheater or Nymh for that matter. If he was cheating Blizz might have stepped in and suspended him like they did that other guy. Being able to heal or help someone not in your group is a great part of the game. Drive by buffs and heals are great. I often felt bad on my Warlock that I could really only hit someone up with water breathing as opposed to a druid or pally who has many more buffs to share with the passersby.<br />
<br />
That was not the point I was making. Perhaps &quot;exploiting&quot; was the wrong term. <br />
<br />
However lets see how long it takes Nymh AND the healer to make it to 80 BOTH in the group. That is what I am pointing out. Of course it is faster to have a out of group pocket healer getting no XP following you around. That's no achievement. Its just taking advantage of the system.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sakuyarules</div><div class="date">2008-12-16, 10:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I consider anything that gets hotfixed by blizzard to be an exploit, and if anyone has been in the drakil'jin ruins lately the neutral mobs don't give exp anymore, and they also aren't lootable. <br />
<br />
Just wanted to reiterate this.<br />
World first 70 mob-tagged with his whole guild (or at least 40 people from his guild), albeit outside of instance.<br />
Athene's way of leveling was apparently hotfixed before, meaning it was an exploit. Nymh's way of leveling has since been hotfixed, meaning it was also an exploit.<br />
<br />
So in my opinion first person to hit 80 without out-of-party help is world first.</div></div><hr />

So someone who did it by tagging or by getting off healed shouldnt count as first lvl 80.<br />
<br />
Who made server first by mob grinding can be proud of having missed all the quest experience up to lvl 80. He missed great quests and new quest designs. It´s not the same experience to do all those quests with lvl 80.<br />
<br />
That considered such players should imho not be counted as the servers first lvl 80 because the only thing those &quot;players&quot; have achieved is to find people to help them doing theyr work (or a part of it).<br />
