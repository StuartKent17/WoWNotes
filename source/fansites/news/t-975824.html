With the final showdown against Deathwing approaching, we’ve been keeping a close eye on players' progress through the current Firelands raid content. Before patch 4.3 is released, we want groups who are working on Heroic-difficulty content to be able to get as close to Ragnaros as possible, and we want players who are tackling normal progression to be able to experience as many of the encounters as they can. To achieve these goals, we’ll be toning down the difficulty of both normal and Heroic raids through hotfixes in the coming weeks. In general, we plan to reduce health and damage of all raid bosses in both normal and Heroic Firelands by around the same percentage we brought difficulty down for the original Cataclysm raids when Rage of the Firelands (patch 4.2) was released.<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to seeing more groups of players face off against the Fire Lord in the weeks ahead. However, before we make these changes, we want to give everyone a final shot at the bosses at their current difficulty level -- so this is a heads up that we’re planning to apply the difficulty hotfixes beginning the week of September 19.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned to the Patch 4.2 Hotfixes blog for these and other live updates to the game as they happen.</div></div><hr />

They already cleared all the content a long time ago. If anything, they would welcome the change since it would make it easier to gear alts and make farm nights go by just that much quicker so they can do other things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, building a guild from 0 a month after Firelands starts means we shouldn't enjoy progression normally because heroics are too hard for the part of the playerbase its not aimed at? They can nerf normals all they want, makes chill/fun 10man alt runs faster and might be able to speed clear 7/7 now, but i really really don't see any reason to nerf heroics, first 6 bosses are already fairly easy.</div></div><hr />

This makes no sense. You can't have your cake and eat it too.<br />

If ICC was too hard, they could have turned off the buff. But then they would have go and farm gear? You realize that's what people have to do before the buff, right?</div></div><hr />

Is it just me or are they starting a &quot;listening and showing it&quot; policy ? First the questions about the classes, then this... Anyway, I don't really care about normal difficulty, it's actually a good thing it gets nerfed : it'll enable PUG's to run Firelands without any problem (even though that's already the case in most places). About heroic difficulty, people who didn't manage to dig their way through to Ragnaros yet get what they deserve... It's been a while now since most guilds, mine included, are 6/7. If you didn't manage to get there, then your guild/raid simply didn't show enough skills to do it, get it over with. I'm actually glad heroics are getting nerfed (as long as they don't nerf Ragnaros again), it'll just be an easier way to clean 6/7 on every Wednesday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could already see normal rag fairly easily, and nothing wrong with making it even easier, but why would anyone that doesn't care about progression would care about seeing heroic Rag or heroic modes? They are meant to be the real fight, the real challenge, but lorewise/skin wise/whatever they are identical to normal, normal is there so people ''see'' content, so why nerf heroics?</div></div><hr />

Most of the time, HC mode just adds a few mechanics and more health and damage, but Rag actually adds an entirely unique phase that transforms the boss in a unique way. Blizz probably just wants the players to see one of the most epic encounters they have ever designed the way it was meant to be seen: WITH LEGS!</div></div><hr />

<br />
My argument has, and always will be, where is the enjoyment in killing / working on something which is easy? When you nerf encounters so others can supposedly 'see the encounters', what you are in fact achieving is the opposite. People are not 'seeing' the encounters, they're seeing a boss which is stripped of difficulty, they're seeing a different boss.<br />
<br />
I don't really see why it needs to be nerfed further, all it's doing is just diluting the experiance for everyone.</div></div><hr />

Why nerf even HEROICs even before 4.3 PTR is up?!?<br />
If they indeed nerf them like they nerfed 4.1 normal modes, even terrible players will be running around in 391 gear.<br />
<br />
I hope they don't actually mean they'll immediately nerf heroics to the ground, and that there is some deep reason, like that they want to tune 4.3 tighter, and decided they wanted less incoming gear variance to be able to do that.<br />
<br />
And maybe it means 4.3 goes on PTR next week?</div></div><hr />

Yeah and before I get flamed for being part of the dominant elite let it be know that I am in a so called casual guild and still feel this is a bad move.

Same.

Most of the time, HC mode just adds a few mechanics and more health and damage, but Rag actually adds an entirely unique phase that transforms the boss in a unique way. Blizz probably just wants the players to see one of the most epic encounters they have ever designed the way it was meant to be seen: WITH LEGS!Which is exactly why they nerfed Heroic Cho'gall and Sinestra in 4.2<br />
Wait a minute, they didn't. And that was even bigger than Ragnaros, not just one new phase, but an entirely new boss. Not only it didn't get nerfed halfway across the tier, it was left alone even after Firelands appeared.<br />
So... what kind of logic is Blizzard using here?</div></div><hr />

You're wrong. Race is part of it, but the challenge to kill a boss, and then the exhiliration that you've done it, that's why people raid. Racing is a nice bonus.<br />
<br />
No serious raider will want an easy boss. <br />
<br />
A rag nerf would be uncalled for. They can do whatever they want with other bosses, though I find it stupid to nerf heroic. If heroic's too hard for you, then you should do normal, that's why there's the 2 difficulties in the first place. /shrug</div></div><hr />

That's exactly what I said earlier, I don't care about the first 6 bosses, I just hope Ragnaros won't get nerfed even more since it's the last piece of challenge left in the Firelands. <br />

And of course, nobody likes an easy boss and I'm always the first to pull off some nerdscreams after an important kill, but the sooner the boss is killed, the nerder they get.</div></div><hr />

This still doesn't make sense, they didn't nerf the heroic Cho'gall encounter just so people could see Sinestra. <br />
<br />
Everyone has another whole tier to get to Heroic Ragnaros if they really want to see the fight. In addition to this whole next tier, I'm sure there will be some sort of buff for 5.0 (before the next expansion comes out).<br />
<br />
I don't agree with the concept of nerfing heroic encounters, maybe it's selfish because we're only 4/7H, soon to be 5/7H and I'd like to down at least 6/7H pre-nerf. Downing Ragnaros before 4.3 comes out is a goal of ours, but as many people have said in this thread it won't feel quite right after multiple nerfs. <br />

Here's to hoping the nerfs to Heroic modes aren't too bad, or Blizzard backs off the idea all-together.</div></div><hr />

Normals ok, I mean they are to meant for people who just want to have fun and raid. Herorics have always been to me the challenge the Hard Core players want. At the very least nerf herorics when 4.3 comes out, not before. I don't even do the heroric raids and I am not a huge fan of the changes to them. I was glad when they announced the nerfs for the previous raid tier wasn't affecting herorics. Herorics to me is for the best guilds out there. This is why they get a extra boss or phase and as someone who raids casually. I don't mind they get that cool stuff and get a exclusive mount or something. For those who are raiding herorics and don't want them nerfed, it sucks to be you. It is just too soon to nerf. I understand if the content was out for 5-6 months, but not 2 months.

That sounds exactly right. Blizzard wants to move things along, so that by the time 4.3 comes out people will be very ready for it. They're only doing 3 tiers of content this expansion instead of the normal 4, and they still need to move things along to get everything wrapped up in time. Apparently not enough raiders had gotten through Firelands compared to what they wanted, at this point before the next patch lands. The nerfs to heroic mode are very strange though, given how they've set up the expectation for that difficulty of content.<br />
<br />
It is kind of amusing, how the playerbase shifts so much between &quot;the content takes too long to get here!&quot; and &quot;we need more time before the next content patch&quot;.</div></div><hr />

We don't need these nerfs. This will only serve to detriment the prestige and allure of downing bosses and progressing through content. Normals were an absolute joke from the beginning but were met with genuinely challengingly fun heroic encounters. This is an insult to raiders of every type.<br />
<br />
Normal mode raider? You're getting bosses handed to you.<br />
Heroic content progression? Your challenges are gone.<br />
Already finished the content? Your achievements have been devalued.<br />
<br />
Gear is the buff that raiders obtain to down the difficult content. Too hard for your group? You'll eventually obtain gear that others didn't have in order to down the boss and will still get the prestige of having downed the exact same boss as the other raids. By nerfing current content raids Blizzard diminishes the value and importance of gear, progression, and the general enjoying challenges that are raid encounters.</div></div><hr />

Well thankfully they dont have short sighted elitist dickheads like you working for them. Honestly people will bitch about anything. If you have already killed it then you have no room to complain or care. If you have not killed Rag yet then you obviously were not up to killing him when he was hard.

<br />
with 4.3 nearly here they want as many ppl to see the content as they can. It has been hard up till now for casuals.<br />
<br />
If u have not killed rag on norm or heroic by now obviously its cause you didnt raid enough or were not skilled enough.<br />
<br />
Depends on what ur guild was aiming for. Before everyone QQ make sure you have killed the level of the raid ut QQing about.<br />

So on one side you have ''big bad elitists'' asking that raiding is split in two distinct category. Normals, that everyone and their mom can casually enjoy and see the whole game. And Heroics, meant for dedicated gamers enjoying challenges. Everyone should be happy right? It covers most of the playerbase.<br />
<br />
Now what hotfixes will bring is, normals that everyone and their mom can casually enjoy and see the whole game...faster, and heroics offering no challenge to the part of the playerbase its aimed at.<br />
<br />

Its painfully obvious that many people haven't even come close to finishing the heroic modes. Why else would they touch heroic modes? Probably way less people than last tier reached the final boss. Obviously this is a much needed crutch for the players.<br />

2000 guilds isn't more than 40,000 people, which is a small number given the total number of subscribers. Whatever Blizzard expects, the number of people completing the content isn't enough. I know a number of guilds on my server stalled during T11, and the number of stalled guilds has only increased during T12. Many people playing the game are exhausted by Cataclysm, and this is an attempt to maintain flagging interest for the next two months.<br />
<br />
The problem is that for nearly a year now, people have been running into a wall after a year where progress was defined by ICC.</div></div><hr />

- People want faster patches, Blizzard delivers, then community whine and say that all their content is getting nerfed. <br />
- People say they want harder content, Blizzard delivers, then community whines when they can't PuG first tier content. <br />
- People say they want to get gear easier, second tier comes and Blizzard delivers, people whine that they nerf content too quickly and turn the game into a grindfest. <br />
- People say they want to live longer in PvP and want the insane burst damage gone, Blizzard increases health across the board and normalise armor and people whine when they die to a tank/healer/control based class/spec in 1v1. <br />
<br />
You're all really convinced that Blizzard is the blame? They're just listening to their customers. the problem is their customers don't know what the fuck they want because they have played the game that long that they are bored of it because they have played it that long and subconsciously think that they are supposed to keep playing it.</div></div><hr />

I understand that only very few have downed rag even in 10 man normal, and tbh the masses that have not (without out gearing the raid) still will not do it, it is a waste of time blizz and again another way to keep subs until 4.3 with bigger and better games coming out.<br />
<br />
You can't have your cake and eat it, and you need to find a way to balance raid content so that it does last with out feeling like a drag, and also (i guess) allow the casual's to raid too.<br />
<br />
but tbh what ever, thanks for breaking 4.2 raiding after what 3 months....</div></div><hr />

Im just about done with wow, I'll continue to play it but I'm almost positive that when Guild wars 2 comes out I will be going to play that if this continues.. World of Warcraft is just going to be like another Xbox game or Wii multiplayer(like Mario Party) where you can get any group idiots and kill bosses, that's not what this game is or was about, its about getting the best of the best to take down incredible bosses with great accuracy for phat lewtz so you can say you are awesome.. Whatever, though.. Blizzard needs money so what else to get more subscribers then to make everyone equal.. Inc RL Auction House, More Mounts on the blizzard store, free achievements, Gear Sets for sell from blizzard themselves.. Ugh, /facedesk permanently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
- People want faster patches, Blizzard delivers, then community whine and say that all their content is getting nerfed. <br />
- People say they want harder content, Blizzard delivers, then community whines when they can't PuG first tier content. <br />
- People say they want to get gear easier, second tier comes and Blizzard delivers, people whine that they nerf content too quickly and turn the game into a grindfest. <br />
- People say they want to live longer in PvP and want the insane burst damage gone, Blizzard increases health across the board and normalise armor and people whine when they die to a tank/healer/control based class/spec in 1v1. <br />
<br />
You're all really convinced that Blizzard is the blame? They're just listening to their customers. the problem is their customers don't know what the fuck they want because they have played the game that long that they are bored of it because they have played it that long and subconsciously think that they are supposed to keep playing it.<br />

Just because they are going to nerf, lets see in the future Deathwing (the longest fight some say), so bad it wont be fun anymore. I raid sometimes but not all the times. But i know i fun raid when i see it. Such as BWD, they nerfed the nef, omnitron, magmaw, and chimaeron fight so much im just like * the raiding. Blizz to you, sorry if im sounding rude, BUT STOP NERFING THE RAIDS! Do it if only like 90% of the population as completed it. But now when you nerf H rag people are going to feel like they acually ocmpleted it which is a little bull. i would like a challenge and i love the challenges in places such as BC. Go back to BC and get raiding ideas form that. If for some reason you guys, blizz, release a patch or XP on a renewal of pre BC and BC that will bring back SO many people to wow. People quit wow when you started nerfing raids, unless you want another 1mil subscribers to bail on wow.But who am i telling what blizz to do. just a little idea. P.S. IM LOOKING FORWARD FOR 4.3!!!!!!!:D</div></div><hr />

Their model was for normal modes to be the content the majority of the playerbase could see and the heroics for the people who were striving for a challenge. Now you could argue that this is so people can see heroic rag since that fight is significantly different from the reg and if that IS the case then they should just nerf the first 6 bosses and not rag since he was recently nerfed anyways.Just my 27 cents on the topic...</div></div><hr />

<br />
My perspective is not skewed; it's simply coming from a different angle when compared to you. The new stuff won't be out for months yet - it's not even on the PTRs for testing and you should know that a big patch testing will take at least a month or two. So now we have nerfed content for the next couple of months when there's still plenty of opportunity for my guild, and others in similar positions, to experience the game at it's most difficult (and subsequently, engaging). The normal raids were there to ensure as many people as possible could enjoy the content; fair enough. The heroic stuff was there for people to really work for it and for those that adore a challenge.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sicness</div><div class="date">2011-09-13, 12:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So just how many Heroic kills were they expecting after 2 months? There's almost 2000 guilds that are 6/7. They just nerfed Ragnaros. I'd say that quite a lot after such a short amount of time. If the problem is with normal, nerf that.<br />
I mean, seriously, some post around here make it sound like Firelands were out for as long as ICC and thus nerfing them without any sign of 4.3 is fully justified.<br />
<br />
For normal modes they have about half as many guilds clearing Firelands, just like tier 11 when it was current. So this nerf is understandable.</div></div><hr />

Why else would they touch heroic modes? Probably way less people than last tier reached the final boss. Obviously this is a much needed crutch for the players.<br />
<br />
No idea why its taken people months to simply beat Heroic Mode. If you were going to beat it you would have done it by now anyways.<br />
<br />
Why do you feel you have to complete all fights, the only real difference visually and major mechanic wise you get in heroic is an extra phase on the raggy fight, other than that it's the same as normal bar a few mechanics, so your not getting to see much more content, and by nerfing the challenging content that aims for the elitist players so all can get to experience that as well as normal you belittle the game for them hence giving them less content.<br />
<br />
Having all content designed / nerfed / made available to ALL players will kill the game as you have to make it for the lowest common denominator, which leaves no challenge nor sense of accomplishment for the majority of the player-base, if you feel there isn't enough content aimed at you then complain to Blizzard and have push them to add more content, not nerf other players content hence making less overall content.</div></div><hr />

I have some Heroic Firelands progression, albeit not a lot - maybe now we might actually get to Heroic Ragnaros; and who knows maybe even defeat him. And I'm not happy about it, because the challenge is gone, the prestige is gone. The sense of achievement has been taken away. Now I'll never know how far we could've progressed using current tier gear and difficulty. Sure, I might get a fancy title. But it's going to feel worthless.<br />

Not only does WoW not &quot;belong&quot; to any one person, it certainly doesn't belong to self-entitled freaks like you who apparently need this game to justify why they are still breathing. <br />

Nearly all the raid guilds who actually stood a chance at downing H Rag have done it. Only tryhards are mad, because they don't like being reminded that their best wasn't good enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Imo it's a sign of desperation to get players into Firelands since they're realizing that the &quot;difficulty&quot; is a bit over the head of most players. This has been one of the least received raid tiers in quite some time. It's easier and probably a better option as a business to reduce the difficulty on content the hardcores are already destroying and will continue to do so whether you nerf it 20% or buff it 20%, than it is to not have people see your content at all. <br />
<br />
I don't blame Blizzard so much and it's not their fault their playerbase are a bunch of unskilled whiners but they have to do what's in their best interest as a business. People will threaten to quit just to throw a temper tantrum like a child regardless of their decision. <br />

I'd say that covers the majority of the &quot;good&quot; guilds, no? All these guilds are obviously stuck on Ragnaros. Are nerfs to the other 6 bosses affecting these people at all? Doubt it, it'll make it quicker so they can get to Ragnaros faster for more attempts. Then it sort of spirals down to guilds with progress between 5 and 3 out of 7 on heroic. Sure, maybe it sucks for these guilds who are on the verge of kills, but, honestly, were they going to make it 7/7h anyway? I doubt that, at least not until t13 was out, which would have nerfed it in terms of gear regardless. It shouldn't be such a huge outcry!<br />
<br />
Now, granted, I think a 20% global nerf to the heroics is over the top, but 10% or so wouldn't really be so crazy, would it? Honestly, it just seems that the people who would have gotten the stuff cleared pre-nerf, have. Or should have. It's been over two months now, is it really that fun to work on one boss for that long? Yes, the final kill feels great, but it also is a pretty good burn-out. :/</div></div><hr />

Again, isn't this why we have normal and heroic content in the first place, to cater to both groups, normal can be made easy and heroic can be made hard, if your in between you probably won't clear both but you get to see all and get as far as you get in the hard version, can't think of a better compromise tbh.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much. The players complaining and acting like it's the end of the world probably aren't progressed to begin with. As stated before, everyone who's been farming this content since about the second week will proceed to do so whether they nerf it 20% or buff it 20%. You'd think they would be the most excited to not have to sit through the crapfest that is Beth Heroic again and instead get back to Rag progression.<br />
<br />
&quot;Casual&quot; players still aren't going to get far in Firelands even with a nerf. You still have to have some level of competency. A 20% nerf isn't going to stop players from spreading Torment to the raid, teach people to blow up Broodlings, how to turn Rhyolith, to get behind cover on Alys, etc.</div></div><hr />

I think boss encounters are boring, it's too much of the same, no shakeup in the system. Boss fights had been reduced to taunt rotations, add phases and the success of them is heavily based on whether or not people kill themselves.Deathwing sounds like a whole new way of presenting a boss... I think that's the sort of thing they need to introduce. It can't just be 'enter room, engage boss'. The scale of the fights seem soo small. I think back to games like Shadow of the Colossus and how epic the fights felt, if they could make the scale of the fights bigger, more unique, I think people will be more drawn into it.</div></div><hr />

you can watch vids for that shit, the nerf allows lesser geared people to raid content that i and others have busted our nuts to do and i think it is unfair on players with skill to reward players with lesser skill, they have their welfare epics ffs and t11 from normal hc's and t12 from normal hc's, untill 4.3 why nerf it and allow this shit to go on, unless you are scared to lose subs to starwars....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've been playing this game for just under 7 years now and the only tier that I didn't really get to experience was the tier 11 heroic stuff. I like that they are nerfing the content because it allows more people to either progress further with their raiding or even get more people into raiding. (Killing more bosses = enjoyment) <br />
<br />
As I'm sure you have seen 25man guilds have been mostly suffering greatly in Cata raiding because 1) 10mans are easier and 2) 25mans are harder to organise/recruit for because of some servers small raiding player pools. If this convinces more people to raid then I'm all for it. <br />
<br />
And honestly to all those complaining, learn to have a bit more fun. <br />
<br />
There is another reason too. Blizzard have probably tuned Deathwing's lair for a raid that is in full 391's. If people haven't been farming 6/7 HM for at least 4-5 weeks then they wont be geared enough.</div></div><hr />

I know on my server, there is only one 25man guild left. The other three guilds are struggling to get 25 but are stuck doing 10s the past couple months. But that is being too optimistic, these nerfs will make it so it's easier to carry the couple bads in 10 and make it less composition dependent.<br />

Btw, I'm fine with the nerfs since I accepted long and while ago that my server was not top tier and accepted being an &quot;average&quot; raider and raiding guild. No hate here man.</div></div><hr />

Aside from Ragnaros, anything that was remotely hard was nerfed within a few weeks, allowing the lobotomised masses to kill them and become deluded with their own ability. What is sad is that this sets a precedent for future content, that it is supposed to be a part of everyone's progression path, and not just those who are actually competent enough to defeat the real fight.</div></div><hr />
