Developer Interviews<br />
The developers are doing interviews as we get closers to launch, so here is a recap from a few more. Thanks to OMFGCata (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_yvb5XyGdi0&amp;feature=g-u-u), Convert to Raid (http://converttoraid.com/), and WoWInsider (http://wow.joystiq.com/2012/09/20/wow-insider-interviews-lead-quest-designer-dave-kosak/#continued). Keep checking back for more interview summaries, along with our own interview with Cory Stockton! <br />
<br />
Ion Hazzikostas - Lead Encounter Designer (Convert to Raid)<br />
<br />
The lessons learned from the Theramore feedback will be applied to the scenarios made in the future. <br />
A balance between showing the story and letting people skip it is seen with the event at the end of Dragon Soul that can be skipped if you don't want to watch it. <br />
Patch 4.0 had several 10 man bosses that were not tuned well compared to the 25 man versions, either much harder or much easier. Tuning got better over the expansion and lessons learned will be applied in Mists of Pandaria.<br />
Raiders liked the Patch 4.0 dungeons, but LFD users found them frustrating. Most people who are doing the heroic dungeons are now using the LFD tool, making it necessary to make the dungeons easier. This leaves Challenge Modes for players that want content that is harder. <br />
Challenge modes won't be coming to raids immediately, but the leaderboard aspect might be something to consider adding. There might not be a large enough group of players that are interested in timed raid runs that don't reward player power increases, but it would give guilds that have content cleared something to compete against other guilds with. <br />
LFR justifies the creation of more raid content when millions of players are able to see content. Only a few thousand people actually saw Kel'thuzad, but millions saw Deathwing. The reason Mists of Pandaria is starting with 18 bosses and adding larger raid tiers than we have had previously is because many players are going to see the raids through LFR. <br />
Beta was very successful, even without level 90 premades. Thousands of people participated in raid testing and provided feedback.<br />
The first raid will open one week after Mists of Pandaria launches, and the next two will open four weeks after that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cory Stockton - Lead Content Designer (OMFGCata) <br />
<br />
The Alliance and Horde both want Pandaria and the Pandaren on their side. <br />
The Jade Forest revamp was the result of feedback from a Strike Team. It wasn't clear why you were in Pandaria and what was going on, so the experience was revamped to make it much clearer. <br />
The smaller phasing you see in the world while progressing through the story does not actually put you in another phase, it just changes what you see. <br />
World Bosses are back because the loot, spawn time, camping, graveyard zerging issues are now able to be solved by new tech. <br />
More bosses per tier is the goal, as longer raids make for more LFR segments. <br />
There are a large number of players that enjoy crafting or aren't able to do raids, which is why the profession recipes like engineering goggles are still relevant even past the first content patch. The gear is still fun to make and useful for those players. It is unlikely that we will see crafted gear that remains upgraded and relevant throughout the entire expansion. <br />
Blood Spirit (http://www.wowdb.com/items/80433) is found from Disenchanting raid weapons and then used for crafting epic gear. It is there to offer an alternative to just Disenchanting some loot and getting materials for an enchant. <br />
The legendary gems are the start of a story that will last through the entire expansion. Every patch there will be a way to keep that legendary going and do more with it so that it is useful for a long time. It also takes care of the problem of previous legendary items lasting a year and being class restricted. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dave Kosak - Lead Quest Designer (WoWInsider)<br />
<br />
Theramore freed Jaina from being a peacekeeper and shows an important event in the war between the Horde and Alliance.<br />
Every new faction is a story to experience rather than a reputation bar to fill. Doing the daily quests unlocks this story.<br />
There is a little bit of Titan vs. Old God lore in Mists, but it is way way way under the surface.<br />
Wrathion has the best interests of Azeroth in mind, but his interests may not necessarily line up with our interests.<br />
It isn't likely that the Lorewalkers will be expanded upon beyond some things to collect in new areas in other patches. This all depends on player engagement and feedback though!<br />
There are lots of books sitting around in Pandaria, just waiting to be read. <br />
<br />

“Appear Offline” Option Coming Soon to Battle.net<br />
In the coming months, we're planning an update to Battle.net that will give you more control over your online presence when playing Blizzard games. Soon, World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, and Diablo III players will be able to select &quot;Appear Offline&quot; as one of their Battle.net social-status options (along with Available, Busy, and Away) for those times when they want to wander Azeroth by their lonesome, dominate the galaxy in radio silence, or slay demons in solitude. When you choose this option as your status, all of your Real ID friends, BattleTag friends, and character-level friends will see you as “Offline” in their friends list whenever you’re logged into a game.<br />
<br />
The “Appear Offline” status option will be added to World of Warcraft, StarCraft II, and Diablo III separately in future updates for each game. For Diablo III, we expect to add the feature in a patch after 1.0.5. For World of Warcraft and StarCraft II, we expect to add the option sometime after the release of each game’s upcoming expansion.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your continued feedback, and we’ll share more information on the availability of this new feature in the months ahead.<br />
<br />

Casters in PvP<br />
I'm showing how i started mage as fire for the first time in Ruthless gear, and how quick i learned how easy it is so inflic alot of damage to your opponents (i:e how to get a 100% proc on insta Pyroblast)<br />
Sorry, but I have to respond with this — On a non-moving target that is always in line-of-sight and does not put any pressure back onto you meaning you can go 100% offensive. It is also a good idea to keep in mind that level 85 balance is not indicative of what the balance will be at level 90.<br />
<br />
Is there a different set of abilities im supposed to use to cause damage to players that i can't see when im on target dummies? <br />
I feel that you may have misinterpreted my post. While it is possible to cast the spells mentioned while moving, you cannot guarantee a real target will always be in line of sight to maintain the highest possible damage output. When attacking a target dummy, you will also not have to be thinking about protecting yourself, crowd control or silences. This means you do not need to utilize defensive cooldowns or maneuver strategically. <br />
<br />
As can be seen from some of the posts above; simulations are good to base a theory off of, but they cannot take into account variables that occur when putting that theory into practice. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/236804-i-sincerely-hope/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5349616969?page=1#13))<br />
<br />
Rating Decay<br />
As has been said before, rewarding players for not actively participating in arena is something that we don't like. Players in season 11 were sitting on their rating due to its length and because they were waiting on Mists, but also while they would like to play arena more they feel there is too high a risk of losing the rating that they achieved. This is definitely a part of the system we feel can be improved upon.<br />
<br />
There has to be caution taken with changes to the rating system though. If it is made to punish people for not playing, it may end up punishing players for going on a holiday or being ill which is something that we would like to avoid as well. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/236754-rating-decay/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5348646490?page=1#7))<br />
<br />
Scenarios Feedback<br />
how about the fact that NONE of this is explained properly? we dont see rhonin die, we dont see how jaina survived and we dont see WHY it happened<br />
This is actually a concern the Developers addressed in a recent Developer Q&amp;A session over at the Best Buy site. Here is what they had to say:<br />
<br />
Q: The story of Tides of War is really interesting. I don't think players can get engaged if they have no idea what's happening, the bomb dropping is really anticlimactic. I felt a bit disappointed so little got included in the scenario. Was this because of lack of time, of developers or because you rather keep all that info in the novels.<br />
A: I've been watching the Theramore feedback closely, and this comment seems pretty universal. We tried to keep everything all in the scenario, to make it really self-contained, but not burden it with lots of story that you have to slog through every time you played the scenario. It's pretty clear from the feedback that people wanted more story. We should've surrounded the scenarios with more quests or explanations to help round out the story for the people who wanted to know what exactly was happening. Lesson learned!<br />
<br />
As you can probably get from this, we acknowledge that we didn't put in the level of context that people expected, and this is an important lesson we will keep in mind when working on future scenarios.<br />
<br />
We want scenarios to be repayable, so we are concerned about burdening players with too much story that feels mandatory to wade through, but we can of course see from all the feedback we got from you guys that is also an issue if there is not enough story. We realise that Theramore could have benefited from one or more one-time quests on either end of the scenario, perhaps it could even have been a part of a one-time quest chain.<br />
<br />
May I throw a quote to you? &quot;As with many things, if we can't do something right, we end up not doing it&quot;<br />
<br />
Obviously you did. And you never did anything worse since you decided to give shamans to alliance, and paladins to horde and bloodelves...<br />
First of all, we never said that we never make mistakes. We are only human after all, and to err is human!<br />
<br />
Second of all, what is right is entirely in the eye of the beholder. We do not think that Shaman and Paladins becoming cross faction classes was a mistake, but this of course is an entirely different topic, so let's keep that discussion out of this thread, shall we?! <br />
<br />
What I am trying to clarify here is that we’re trying to do things right and do our best to avoid adding things to the game that can be done better. Of course, if we realise that something wasn't done exactly right after adding it, then we will of course attest to that.

Quest For Pandaria, Part 1<br />
We just released the first part of Quest for Pandaria, a four-part novella set between World of Warcraft: Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
Reunited with her beloved uncle Chen and safely back home on the Wandering Isle, Li Li Stormstout finds it difficult to adjust to life on Shen-zin Su. After all the adventures and excitement of her journey to find her uncle (which you can read about in Pearl of Pandaria, a graphic novel that’s now available here (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/140122699X/) and wherever fine books are sold), Li Li yearns to see more of this amazing world just waiting to be discovered. But after everything that happened, and with all the grief she caused her family, running away again is something that Li Li just can’t do. Lost, sad, and dejected, Li Li is certain that she’ll never get to explore more of this magical world... until one day, the unexpected return of a pandaren most thought dead and the mysterious artifact he bears give Li Li a moment of hope — one moment that makes everything else possible.<br />

Only a few thousand people actually saw Kel'thuzad, but millions saw Deathwing. The reason Mists of Pandaria is starting with 18 bosses and adding larger raid tiers than we have had previously is because many players are going to see the raids through LFR.<br />
<br />
Interesting, it seems that LFR has become the driving force behind raid creation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was mainly for DKs, I believe... blood boil, and the DoT tics from Death and Decay and unholy blight could ALL trigger a gurth tentacle to spawn for each and every enemy they hit. So in essence, a DK runs into onyxia's lair, pulls a mess of dragon whelps, hits blood boil twice and boom... you have about two dozen gurth tentacles flinging spells around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also regarding story in scenarios - do all scripted story have to be intrusive? For example, what if during the initial harbour sweep, you'd have things continously running while you fight the lesser enemies - they are easy enough to not distract you overmuch, and repeated visits surely would have you see the things going on in the background. So instead of making segments, weave them together.</div></div><hr />

Not sure. But my thought while i read it is that warriors with the new weapons, armor, etc coming in mop scale a bit much compared to others. Maybe you dont see it right now, however.</div></div><hr />

I think this could be a a double meaning phrase.He probaly means that we wont see much Old God lore,but it could be a literal interpretation and we are going to face an Old God way below the surface of Pandaria</div></div><hr />

Combined with the big healer mana nerf it drove off so many players in our guild and other guilds we had to scramble to even field a single ten man for a long time. Eventually stealing a few from other guilds that imploded. <br />
<br />
As for invisible mode, about damn time. During D3 beta I was &quot;friended&quot; by a few people who now always see my online status regardless of personal choice. Blizzard blew it big time with their battlenet privacy setup. Worse, they were just plain arrogant in not admitting to the fact that it was being exploited by stalkers and the like. We had more than one person in our guild quit WOW over harassment because they could be tracked this way.</div></div><hr />

The smoke saves it though, that's pretty cool, I like it! but if you're using your cooldowns and get a lot of mutilates close together you're probably going to choke and blind half your raid with all of the smoke.</div></div><hr />

Why would they disable CRZ instead of fixing its issues especially when its a minor thing like the fishing tournaments that barely anyone will care about for months because everyone will be playing the new content?<br />
Taking out CRZ is like taking out LFG and LFR because some people dislike it......not gonna happen.<br />

<br />
Well, I guess my opinion is biased, just as everyone else's. But I still like the rogue set more than any other, guess I am just fond of asian-styled stuff. And the procs for rogues wins over pretty much every other proc. The smokescreen thing. Its very unique and very rogue-like. Unlike fire procs which many classes get. Still curious as to why some classes only get one proc while others get two, I see no reasoning behind it.</div></div><hr />

And that's pretty much what Challenge mode offer...<br />
<br />
You want to be fed ? Farm LFD<br />
You want some challenge ? Try improving your time in challenge mode<br />
You are really good at this game ? Nice, go for gold medal everywhere for your shiny challenge mog armor<br />
<br />
At least its' how I hope it will be. Can't wait to really test challenge mode by myself, hoping something really hard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Huge shoulders seems to be the thing for challenge mode sets. At least the ones Ive seen. Some of the procs are cool but the gear is too ugly to wear despite that.<br />
<br />
A few of the dev interviews lately had questions about &quot;hide shoulders&quot; so you think they would at least make some sets with small shoulders if they arent going to let us hide them. I guess not but I wish they would because I hate big shoulders. WTB hide shoulders.</div></div><hr />

I think it's cute people think challenge modes are hard.<br />

&quot;Raiders liked the Patch 4.0 dungeons, but LFD users found them frustrating. Most people who are doing the heroic dungeons are now using the LFD tool, making it necessary to make the dungeons easier. This leaves Challenge Modes for players that want content that is harder.&quot;<br />
<br />
That sucks, why can't we just have normal and heroic dungeons like we used to? LFD players need some goal to improve towards instead of just being spoonfed faceroll content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't worry, challenge modes will be getting a queue system too, and nerfed, if we know blizzard well enough, we can't have some one with gear other people can't get!.</div></div><hr />

it's a game, not a 10 year plan to give your life structure.</div></div><hr />

They ran a beta test on them the other day. 1st place was 15mins, 6th place was 30 mins, and first was still a few mins away from gold. So yes, they are hard and the odds of anyone here getting even one gold is very very low let alone getting gold in all the dungeons. So yes, complaining about gear you'll never get.</div></div><hr />

Cause finding a group when you are a decent player is hard (of course I don't talk about full gold medal, wich will need a dedicated group) ? Even the most casual player (for me casual = less time to play, not bad) can go challenge. It's time trial, means you have like 45 minutes (random number, depend on dungeon) to make it. No massive amount of time needed, no gear needed, only some skills and communication inside the group. If you don't want to do that, LFD is the only thing possible. You can't ask for something hard and at the same time no communication-aoe-spam-fest like LFD is.<br />
<br />
And don't hope that challenge mode could make it with random queu, it will of course lead to massives nerfs, like always when the mass touch something in this game (not a rant, just a fact actually).</div></div><hr />
