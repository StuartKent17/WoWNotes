Crucible of Storms - Blade of Xal'atath Follow Up Quest<br />
Upon completing the final encounter in Crucible of Storms, a follow up quest will be offered to the Xal'atath quest chain provided that you completed the previous parts of the chain (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8433-Crucible-of-Storms-Introductory-Quest-Chain-Live-Hotfixes-Rise-of-Shadows-Live). *SPOILERS BELOW*<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are Horde, the empty blade of Xal'atath will appear on the ground in Uu'nat's room after killing him. You are then given the quest The Black Blade (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/54683-the-black-blade) which has you bring the blade to Sylvanas. She says that the blade will be the compass that guides the Horde to victory and that the Alliance has no idea what it's up against. She claims that with the blade, they will shift the war in the Horde's favor once again.<br />
If you are Alliance, you will only see the image of where the empty blade of Xal'atath sat, and this gives you the quest The Missing Blade to warn Anduin of what happened in the Crucible of Storms. He is concerned that the blade has fallen into the hands of Sylvanas, and says it is clear by her actions that she doesn't fight for the Horde, but death itself. He says that they must stop whatever madness she plans to use the weapon for if there is to be peace between the factions.<br />

Vision of Perfection - Azerite Essence Feedback<br />
Thank you for all of the feedback on Vision of Perfection (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/297868-vision-of-perfection)—it’s an idea we’re also very excited about. As always, the first iteration of new abilities on a PTR have tuning that is somewhat preliminary. That’s especially true for this ability, due to the complexity of the effect and the large number of interactions it has. Our goal is to make it an interesting choice among the other available Essences, while preserving the concept of it. For this and the other Essences, there will be ongoing tuning updates in the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
On the specific issue of interactions between Vision of Perfection and other effects that trigger from or buff your cooldowns: part of what makes this Essence exciting is the opportunity to explore things like that. At the same time, if they occur at full value every time Vision procs, that may be far too much.<br />
<br />
Our initial plan is that, as a standard approach, the added effects or bonuses should be reduced in value, in the same way that the cooldown itself is reduced in duration. For example, if Recklessness is proccing at 40% effectiveness, Reckless Abandon should also provide 40% of its normal Rage value. There are some cases where this doesn’t work because there’s no way to “scale down” an effect—Summon Infernal will either stun or not stun when it lands. We’ll have to handle those cases individually.<br />
<br />
You’ll see adjustments to this (and likely some other items) in a future build of the PTR.<br />

Druid travel form (and things like it) do not benefit from the mount equipment. Only mounts summoned from that collection do.

And then what? We will end up with another warchief who will go batshit crazy or get killed. <br />
<br />
I’d prefer Sylvanas stay so no other horde leaders take the cursed seat of warchief and go lolbad or die. Like some sort of bulwark against bad plots.<br />

Just have the Horde get completely wiped out and force every player to reroll to Alliance in the next expansion.<br />

WE Don't kill her.<br />

Nathanos does.<br />

N'zoth tells her that he says he loves her and cares for her but all he wants is the mantle of Warchief. Maybe the voices can be N'zoth all distorted to sound like Thrall or Vol'jin or Varian.<br />

You mean the blade that can suddenly vanish from even the ones it was feeding power? If you haven´t read up on its story do so, and you will see it is a weapon that will only work for itself and its old god master (and doubt that changed even with the entity in another body).</div></div><hr />

She and Illidan are the two characters who actually make WoW lore worth following. If she was killed as soon as the 14 year old virgins wanted her dead there would be literally no reason to follow the lore. Name one interesting character with attitude that actually does something aside from Illidan who they removed and Sylvanas. They are all more boring than island expeditions and Warfronts combined. Thank god she is still alive and carries the whole WoW lore on her back at this point.</div></div><hr />

Thrall: Only the Lich King deals in absolutes. I will do what I must.<br />
Sylvanas: You will try.<br />
<br />
Anyone else see this transpiring?<br />
<br />
Sylvanas: Show me the power of the Old Gods, Garrosh. If you do that, I will finish what you started.</div></div><hr />

Sure, they’re baiting us down that road with lots of similarities but you can bet they’ll completely flip it on its head come 8.3.<br />
<br />
I agree but either way it's trash writing. That's some Rian Johnson shit to try to bait people like, &quot;Ooh doesn't this seem similar to what happened before? HA GOT YOU, it's NOT like before because I subverted your expectations at the last second.&quot; How about....just don't copy tired story elements in the first place and do something new? Hell, even the idea of her not being a big bad was already done in the lore with Illidan. Everyone thought he was a crazy demon freak and nope, turns out he was secretly the selfless good guy all along. There isn't much room for them to make a satisfying conclusion to this and the story in the meantime is boring and stupid anyway so what's the point?</div></div><hr />

The game was built on that concept from the very beginning, why suddenly there is a need for this to be changed?<br />
<br />
Because it's boring as fuck by now. No sane person want's the same story for 15 years.</div></div><hr />

If she was killed as soon as the 14 year old virgins wanted her dead there would be literally no reason to follow the lore. <br />
<br />
Why would her fanbase want her dead?</div></div><hr />
