Patch 3.3.3 introduced a couple of new mounts and I think it's time for a recap! 
 
Celestial Steed 
The Celestial Steed is probably the most impressive mount of his patch, it looks like a mix of Invincible and Algalon. I'm not really sure where this mount will drop for the moment but considering how cool it looks, I wouldn't expect it to be widely available.

Patch 3.3.3 introduced a couple of new mounts and I think it's time for a recap!<br />
<br />
Celestial Steed (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/75614/celestial-steed/)<br />
The Celestial Steed is probably the most impressive mount of his patch, it looks like a mix of Invincible (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7J3tAxFFjQ&amp;feature=related) and Algalon. I'm not really sure where this mount will drop for the moment but considering how cool it looks, I wouldn't expect it to be widely available. <br />

<br />
<br />
Blazing Hippogryph (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74856/blazing-hippogryph/) and Wooly White Rhino (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74918/wooly-white-rhino/)<br />
Both mounts are supposed to be TCG Rewards but as you probably know, Blizzard and Upper Deck Entertainment won't be working together anymore in 2010 and the future of the WoW TCG game is unclear. The Blazing Hippogryph (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74856/blazing-hippogryph/) was supposed to be a reward of the Wrathgate TCG expansion (UDI stated that Wrathgate Booster won't go into production) and the Wooly White Rhino (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/74918/wooly-white-rhino/) is currently a reward of the &quot;Icecrown&quot; TCG expansion. <br />
<br />
Even if we can't know what will happen with the TCG, it's pretty obvious that Blizzard has a plan and developers aren't adding more TCG rewards to the game just for fun. Just sit tight and wait for the official announcement. <br />

Crimson Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73313/crimson-deathcharger/) / Azure Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/c/39045/azure-deathcharger/)<br />
I'm starting to hate these mounts. A couple of days ago I pointed out that they were most likely a reward of the new Icecrown Citadel Quests (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/authenticator-accounts-hacked-icc-quests-crimson-deathcharger/) but I slightly changed my mind since then. If you go through the list of new mounts (http://db.mmo-champion.com/spells/777/?id__gt=73000) in the database you will notice that the Crimson Deathcharger is actually a &quot;summon&quot;, this property only applies to class mounts and it could be the sign that Blizzard just decided to be nice to Death Knights and wants to give them faction-specific mounts like Paladins. Once again, we will probably have to wait until the patch is live to figure it out. <br />

Tom Chilton, Game Director- 5 Year Interview<br />
In this interview, World of Warcraft Game Director Tom Chilton talks about the hectic final months leading up to the game’s launch, crafting an MMORPG for a wide range of play styles, and the ongoing effort to improve the game through expansions and content updates.<br />

World of Warcraft BattleCry Mosaic Complete<br />
Thanks to the combined effort of Warcraft players from around the world, we have reached twenty thousand submissions, and the final piece of the World of Warcraft BattleCry Mosaic has been revealed. Head over to the World of Warcraft anniversary site now and check out the complete mosaic, which can only be described by one word: epic.<br />
<br />
You can now look at the complete mosaic using the site's mosaic viewer, download the original artwork wallpaper, and of course view the legendary-sized mosaic wallpaper. And while you’re there, make sure to also check out all the previously unlocked content.<br />
<br />
Thank you to everyone who sent in their pictures to help us create a little piece of Warcraft history, and thank you to all our players around the world for your continued support. Lok'tar!<br />
<br />
Check out the BattleCry page now, as well as our our updated special Battlecry Gallery (11 new):<br />
<br />

<br />
The wallpaper is probably one of the best ever released by Blizzard, it includes 4:3, widescreen, and even dual-screen versions! <br />

Blizzard Voice Chat<br />
The Blizzard Voice chat is actually pretty cool, and has improved greatly since it was released. We do see it as a success. We're completely fine with players using third party voice chat programs. It was simply important to us that an option was available for those who didn't want to rely on a 3rd party voice chat program -- no matter their reasons.<br />
<br />
Additionally, there are a great deal more players who use it than you probably realize. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23425528064-questions-blues-always-dodge.html))<br />

Dual-Wield DPS itemization in Cataclysm<br />
We will be making one-handed weapons with Strength on them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425637887-dw-frost-dks-and-cataclysm-stat-changes.html))<br />
<br />
Hit in Cataclysm<br />
As I've said, it doesn't really work that way though. Say you need 300 hit (using arbitrary numbers here) and your tier set provides 250 hit and you get the rest from gems and jewelry. Everything's cool. Now a new patch comes out and your tier set has 230 hit. No problem. You get rid of some of the gems and jewelry. Now a new patch comes out and your tier set has 240 hit. Now you curse Blizzard every time an item drops with hit on it.<br />
<br />
In short, later gear has more of the same stat on it. When the stats are easily capped, the larger pools become hard to work around. I compared it today to playing Tetris with really large pieces. It's hard to make the puzzle work. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23425708130-hit-rating-in-cata-wont-be-fun.html))<br />

Unstable Affliction &quot;nerf&quot; in the latest PTR Build<br />
Tooltip clarification. Move along. [...] I will say that Unstable Affliction backlash being unaffected by resilience really feels like a bug. I don't see how it's a necessary warlock perk. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23425467578-ua-nerf-ty-again-ghost.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
And slapping in faction specific Deathchargers in? Isnt it a bit late for that?<br />
<br />
<br />
Somewhat, but look how late in the game they changed the 225 flight form for druids in BC. Before they actually put in flying 300 the birds at 225 looked the same. :&lt; <br />
<br />
I'm all for the faction specific. While I love my current mount, I rather lose it to faction colors than let some paladin run around on my class mount. Its crazy. That is unless they give us the epic form of paladin mounts/Warlock mounts as payment for stealing one of the best class mounts in game and giving it to every elitist schmuck out there.<br />
<br />
Yes, I dislike elitist raiders, not because they work hard at what they do, but because blizzard (and the raiders) think that only they should have access to the best mounts in game. You would think titles, achievements and the highest end armor in game would be enough. No casual guild is gonna get H ICC 10/25 gear, period.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Speaking for those OCD mount collectors out there, is is annoying that we leveled tailoring for the 2 tailoring mounts, droped tailoring for engineering for the two BOP pets, and the two engineering mounts, not to mention the BOE ground mount. Then to make back the thousands of gold we spend on those professions just for the mounts, we dropped engineering for a profession that could actually make gold (in my case JC). Now we find out that we are going to have to drop JC so we can level tailoring all over again, for this new BOP mount. <br />
<br />
Having to go back to tailoring wouldn't be as painful if I could start back at 450 tailoring, with all my old recipes stored away somewhere. They can do it with talent points, seems they should be able to do it with professions, the professions link in armory seems to support that they could do it, since there is a counter to all recipes for all crafting professions. If you toggled from JC to tailoring you would have your JC gems deactivate, just like using the cheap tailoring thread would deactivate if you toggled from tailoring to JC. This would make life easier for min/maxers, as well as people who like to RP, flying around on a engineering mount for a day.<br />
<br />
The current system of losing all your skill points, and all your recipes, seems to me to not be in line with blizzard's &quot;casual friendly&quot; motto.</div></div><hr />

Dual-Wield DPS itemization in Cataclysm<br />
We will be making one-handed weapons with Strength on them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/23425637887-dw-frost-dks-and-cataclysm-stat-changes.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Speaking as a DW Tank, this is fantastic, but I wonder about availability now. The only ways I see this working is allowing other classes to use DPS Str1h which means either Rogues, Hunters, and Enhance or Pal and War tanks. Simpler solution, honestly, would seem to me to allow DKs to receive 2AP from 1Agi same as with Str but strictly for weapon slots. We could wield Polearms then which are generally the territory of only Hunters and Ferals and DPS1h without needing new items.<br />
<br />
My most significant concern with DPS1H currently is the lack of comparable Sta. Equivalent iLvl DPS1h have almost half as much Sta as a Tank1h, and we lack shields. Compare 92+120 vs 47+47 (iLvL251, ICC10), or a difference of well beyond 100 Sta. Of course, with the change to providing more Sta for everyone this concern is replaced by the lack of AP, but why not solve this issue more directly if you do not want to better itemize? Maybe give us iLvl/2=AP for weapons? A tad higher than current so some adjustment should be made, but just a thought.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Paulkariya</div><div class="date">2010-03-04, 09:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Speaking as a fury warrior, I am a little excited about the prospect of going back to one handed weapons and having, well, furious attacks.<br />

That wallpaper is really nice :D If only the orcs ingame looked like Thrall does in that picture (i.e. standing upright :P). Still won't use it as a desktop background, though... I see enough (read: too much :p) of WoW as is, I'd question my sanity if I let my addiction take over my desktop, too... ;D<br />
<br />
EDIT: The Mosaic is just sick :O<br />
<br />
2. QQ, I need that Rhino Mount! Pleaso oh please Blizz, don't make it something only purchasable by RL money. :-[ I wanted a Rhino mount from the moment I saw them in Sholazar :P<br />
<br />
3. Each to his own, I guess, but I'm more than unimpressed with the Celestial Steed... It's just a reskin of the unique and supremely cool Invincible, and just looks &quot;wrong&quot; to me... ah well, I'm probably never gonna see it drop anyways, but even if I did, I'd rather pass on it. Same goes for the Fiery Hippogryph - it doesn't really look 'fiery' at all to me... I just don't like the constant recycling of old models with new skins slapped on :/</div></div><hr />

You see, this is how opinions differ. :) IMO, Velen looks bland and boring compared to the concentrated awsome that is Vol'jin and Cairne, let alone Thrall... :O Well, and Lor'themar is a Blood Elf, and as such is despicable regardless of haircut :P /jk</div></div><hr />

That horse had better not be another fucking TCG or whatever mount... They already got the coolest riding mount, the Spectral Tiger (on par with the no longer available Black Qiraji)...<br />

<br />
On balance I think Thrall Looks better than Varian, but the Alliance's other leaders look better than the Horde's. To be fair though, Velen is practically a demigod (however his status as a PvP boss is balanced, in lore he's like 15K years old and has been leading his people across the fringes of reality for 14K of those). Tyrande looks like she's pouting about something, though. All in all it's still a great piece.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you look carefully, the feeling is that Thrall is way more &quot;on the spotlight&quot; than every other there, even Varian looks like he is a little behind Thrall and not at his side as a alliance counterpart (more because Thrall looks taller than Varian).<br />
<br />
And even between the Horde members, Thrall looks more like a Leader while Varian looks more like a ally of the other alliance races (they're more &quot;equal&quot; while Thrall really stands out from the other Horde leaders).<br />
<br />
Lol.. and thrall not at the &quot;default curved Orc&quot; position helps a lot... lol</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Not really a good idea for the purposes of updating a database.<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
Because renaming the patch-3.mpq means your stopping all the data in that MPQ file to load.<br />
<br />
Which means that if Boub updated the database after doing this hack the database would be incomplete.<br />
<br />
So what's the point of going through all the trouble updating the database when you can't get it all?<br />
<br />
Especially considering the patch-3.MPQ is almost 300 MB ? That's a lot of data missing ... IMHO there's no point updating the database if you can't get it all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Because the faction leaders each represent their race. Jaina is more of an advisor in that sense. Varian already represents humans, no need for two. You can also look at Jaina as Varian's voice of reason. Either way she doesn't belong on that beautiful piece of art because she is in no way a faction leader in the sense that the others are. It would be like asking for Rhonin to be represented on that artwork.</div></div><hr />

What if, All the faction leaders, went into a battle, 5v5?<br />
Imo, that would be epic to watch :o<br />

<br />
And even between the Horde members, Thrall looks more like a Leader while Varian looks more like a ally of the other alliance races (they're more &quot;equal&quot; while Thrall really stands out from the other Horde leaders).<br />
<br />
Lol.. and thrall not at the &quot;default curved Orc&quot; position helps a lot... lol<br />
<br />
<br />
When you put it that way, i really looks like Alliance vs Thrall and some guards :D</div></div><hr />

Personally I say bring on more flying mounts that are not Dragons, really sick of Drakes and Dragons. My flying mount wish list is pretty much.<br />
<br />
1.) Eagle<br />
2.) Bat<br />
3.) Pegasus<br />
4.) Personal Zeppelin<br />
<br />
The Mosaic Art is amazing too! I hope they update all the faction leaders in Cata to have them Mirror the Images of them on the Mosaic!!!</div></div><hr />

Yeah your probably right, get all the Glory of the (Raid Goes Here) Raider Achievements and you get that makes sense, specially with it's relative closeness to Cataclysm release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which mount are you on bout? celestial steed? If so I don't really agree.<br />
I think flaming Hippogryph looks more suited to there, what have stars gotta do with the sanctum of the aspect of life (or the attackers of said sanctum)? <br />
That's more a Ulduar/Titan themed thing IMO.</div></div><hr />

The celestial Steed is a nice mount, personally I can't see why everyone is making such a fuss about it but everyone has their own tastes I guess, I would like the Blazing Hippogryph tbh.<br />
<br />
slightly off topic: Am I the only one who wants to see King Magni Bronzebeard do some more action in Cata? He's been sitting in Ironforge for years, the only action he got was in the Storm Peaks. Plus he's a very powerful leader, could be fun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which brings up the point: Ulduar = Sunwell? But... how?<br />
<br />
Alternatively, Blizz just put the mount from Uldum into the game files really, really early.</div></div><hr />

If I had to guess, those whose pictures were used in the Mosiac got the finished product way ahead of us, lol.

To comment further on the picture: <br />
<br />
-It really looks like Tyrande is &quot;looking&quot; at Sylvanas, Magni or Varian based on her pose and expression. Sylvanas looks like she'd been forced to pose for the group photo. <br />
<br />
-Varian, Vol'Jin and possibly Lorthe'mar are the only ones not holding their trademark weapon. You can see Sylvanas and Tyrande's bows in the dual screen versions of the picture.<br />
<br />
-Mekkatorque and Thrall are the only two actually looking straight ahead: Varian is looking at Thrall, see above for Tyrande and everyone else is looking in a different direction.<br />
<br />
-The in-game class equivelants of the faction leaders are Warrior (Varian, Magni, Carine and Mekkatorque), Shaman (Thrall), Priest (Velen), Hunter (Sylvanas, Lorthe'mar and Tyrande) and Rogue (Voljin).<br />
<br />
-Most importantly: The combined age of everyone pictured is OVER 9,000!<br />
<br />
-Not pictured but noteworthy: Krasus/Korialstrasz, Alexstraza, Rhonin, Vareesa Windrunner, Jaina Proudmoore, Bairne Bloodhoof, Garrosh Hellscream, Marfurion Stormrage, Tirion Fordring and Darion Morgraine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Die. I do agree that it is an epic picture but Varian is holding at least one of his swords.<br />
<br />
Also, maybe it's just me but I feel that Sylvanas should have replaced the faceless Blood Elf. No one really cares about him so it's only right he gets thrown off to the side.</div></div><hr />

But it's strange how Blizzard doesn't really take advantage of their lore characters that much. Sure King Chin got the limelight as of late because of the comic book and Thrall is like Metzen's baby, but the rest? When was the last time Voljin or Tyranda did anything?</div></div><hr />

I've been wishing they'd add rhino mounts to the game since I first saw their skins here on MMO before the release of Wrath.<br />

<br />
Yep!<br />
I reckon it'll be an Algalon drop, perhaps as the last VoA boss, or maybe just to give people a reason to farm him in Ulduar. The other hard mode last bosses all give mounts, why shouldn't he! <br />
Anyway, whatever it's from, I'll bet it'll be stupid hard to get, and a low droprate. I doubt it'll be a &quot;super raiding meta&quot;, it'll be too easy at lvl85 to steamroll each lvl80 raid and get all of them. I can't see them just handing those out.</div></div><hr />
