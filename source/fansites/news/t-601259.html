Cauldrons will be added in the 2.1.0 as new alchemy recipes, they're a bit like Soul wells created by warlocks but instead of giving you health stones, they will give you major resistance potions. I'd also like to point out the fact that the new resistance potions have a 2 minutes effect instead of the 1 hour timer on the old ones. <br />
And before you ask, nop, no Holy cauldrons. ^^<br />

Method interviewed on WCRadio + new radio-sketch<br />
Method will be interviewed on WoW Radio's (http://www.wcradio.com/) flagship show 'Blue Plz!' on Sunday 13th of May about their Lady Vashj kill and end-game experiences. You can join them for a musical preshow at 17:30 servertime (11:30 EST) with the live show kicking off at 18:30 servertime (12:30 EST).<br />
Listeners have the opportunity to submit questions for the interview on the WoW Radio forums, the thread for which can be found here. (http://www.wcradio.com/forums/index.php?s=cd5205e26e1099aa209cd72cf96e10e7&amp;showtopic=5760&amp;view=getnewpost)<br />
<br />
A satirical radio-sketch called Nubcake News has dealt with the issue of the supposed 'legitimate' World First, featuring such personalities as Kungen. The download can be found here (http://www.wcradio.com/archive/blueplz/worldfirst.mp3). Nihilum (http://www.nihilum.eu) are also mirroring the file <br />
here (ftp://ftp1.mousesports.com/mousesports/downloads/videos/wow/worldfirst.mp3).<br />
This is a followup to the 'We Heart Kungen' comedy skit that was featured a few week's back on WoW Radio and achieved huge viral popularity. The download for this can be found here (http://www.wcradio.com/archive/blueplz/weheartkungen.mp3).<br />
<br />
And as a small reminder.<br />
