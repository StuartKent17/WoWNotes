remember that its a work day in the middle of the day, and people can easily watch these later? also that they stream to not just twitch, there is 10k people watching right now also pvp is a minority compared to pve so of corse alot less people will watch</div></div><hr />

Mythic raid boss mounts arent. You can even go farm them after the content isnt relevant anymore. Why do you think its cool for my mounts to rot on characters I dont play but for lvl 20 alts to ride around on KJ mechano whatchamafuck? I earned my mounts tye same way. The point of letting pve ones be acccount wide is to shpw your accomplishment. How is this different?<br />
<br />
You guys have the stupidest rationale for stuff that shouldnt be an issue. You contradict yourselves constantly, and then blame us. If you can do it in pve, you should be able to do it in pvp. Quit gating skins behind rating and blocking alts from using mounts to make pvpers feel special. That ship saild back in tbc when i sold people shoulders rating, ans then you went and made it free tmog through tokens anyway.</div></div><hr />

Ugh, dont remind me of that heels guy. I remember his clickbait videos. Funny thing, when Legion solved &quot;no content&quot; problem that he shouted about, he just.. quit. It is obvious for me that he just feed on the negavity around WoW and with Legion launch his typical audience just lost interest.<br />

agreed, allthough this new system is better, its no where near as good as just &quot;get currency buy gear&quot; hell even for pve, icc/toc was prob my fave gearing system for pve, buyying your base teir by doing stuff ,then upgrading it from raid instead of just hoping to drop<br />

yeah there is mods perma banning, therei s alot of people making death threats and spamming &quot;hitler did nothing wrong&quot; but they are gone in milla seconds<br />
<br />
i think they should really just upload these to youtube, disable comments/rating, because there is no point to stream it, since they cant interact with chat because holy shit its horrible.... and therei s no benefit to it being live, this could be pre-recorded, and we wouldent know until something happens like an earth quake happens and it doesent show on the stream</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What's so bad about &quot;good players&quot; using abilities that &quot;bad players&quot; generally don't use? <br />
<br />
What's the point of removing abilities that create a skill cap/depth to a class in PVP(disarm trap, scare beast, bind elemental, etc)?<br />

Likely its on purpose. Holinka is rather known for hating and avoiding doing any of these QA. There was one he was supposed to be around for that he flat out didn't do when it came time for interviewing. Likely because they are usually followed with a great deal of hate from the community since Holinka is also rather notorious for getting blatant facts about PvP wrong. Like during the WoD human racial debacle he both defended the human racial as fine, and also was wrong on the cooldown of the normal freedom trinket (he thought it had a cooldown 30 seconds less than it actually was). Or when he streamed himself soloing teams on a Frost DK back when it had insane self healing, and defended this as good balance.</div></div><hr />

Thats common for all QA blizzard does. They very rarely answer anything that isnt a low ball question or something they've already answered. The QA is meant to give an illusion of caring and activity. Most of this QA was stuff we already knew or &quot;We're maybe working on it&quot;.

They very rarely answer anything that isnt a low ball question or something they've already answered. The QA is meant to give an illusion of caring and activity. Most of this QA was stuff we already knew or &quot;We're maybe working on it&quot;. The only time we typically get some good new information is the increasingly rare lore QA.<br />
<br />
isnt the obliterating not wanted pvp gear to turn it into wanted pvp gear known before? i dident know that<br />
i did know that the pvp mounts(not glad) becoming account wide but aparently alot of others dident, so thats why those chose to do that question i guess,<br />
<br />
also we dident know about them wanting to make like a pvp hub (like how people used to hang around the pvp vendors and talk pvp/duel) and think it would be cool to have duels that are done there to do pvp template/talents, this way we dont have to worry about templates/talents in duels causing exploits, also cool to have a place for pvpers to hang out, the underbelly is sorta like that? but its annoying as it forces fights instead of silly dueling</div></div><hr />

<br />
The PvP obliterating was known yes.<br />
<br />
The hub is something they just mentioned might be a good idea, didn't even say they were intending on implementing it. At most we might get it next expansion or maybe 7.3. <br />
<br />
Dueling templates is something that has universally been requested by the PvP community since launch. Their reasoning for not having it is entirely divorced from the reality. People don't tend to do a lot of duels to show off their gear. That is so stupid I dont even have a sufficiently powerful enough word to describe it. They do it to show off how good they are and/or practice. As it is now, someone dueling tends to win becuase their gear and people know it. Its why the old dueling grounds have largely died since Legion's launch. Theres no pride, no sense of accomplishment, in it. <br />
<br />
The QnA looks like glorified patch notes for someone whose been keeping up to date with 7.2 information. A lot of known, maybe not well know, but known none the less information.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the CRZ and sharding has done a lot to flat out ruin RPing on RP servers. That comment is rather infuriating to someone who RPs. Not only because its blatantly untrue, but if it WAS true they're telling none-RPers to go to RP servers to... not RP.</div></div><hr />

Previous season gear can be currently bought with marks of honor. <br />
<br />
Elite sets will require rating.</div></div><hr />

No, it fucking doesn't. CRZ sucks in every way possible and it one of the worst features added to WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you want to avoid CRZ and sharding, maybe check out an RP realm.<br />
Oh yeah? Let me grab those thousands of euro I don't have to transfer all my characters. Just remove CRZ instead. I also don't RP, and I know for a fact that RP players don't want their realms infested with tons of people that don't RP.</div></div><hr />

Right? lol.<br />
<br />
Statements like that are really the little indicators to me that show how out-of-touch and disinterested the current devs are.<br />
<br />
I mean this is pretty much the equivalent of a city with major infrastructure problems telling their citizens to go build a hut in the forest and live off the land to avoid traffic problems.</div></div><hr />

Do they honestly have to have Lore on there all the time? The community obviously does not like the guy, and he continously wastes time with his worthless opinions, we see this every single QA where he takes up at least 5-10 minutes to share &quot;his own experience&quot; <br />
These QAs should be rapid fire questions and then they can elaborate on the forums later on if there's a certain thing that did not come across that well.<br />
<br />
Dude, Lore's entire job is to tell us what Ion and Holinka really meant to say, by using his own experiences. <br />
<br />
Is it just me, or does anyone else want to light his cheap perm on fire?</div></div><hr />

You are a pitiful fanboy who only plays PvE , it's pretty disgusting that you would actually feel sorry for the guy who is ruining it for all the PvP'ers out there. For future reference just abstain from posting in general on the internet if possible . Thank you sincerely the PvP community !<br />
<br />
PvP is gone from this game it's merely a side mini-game ,watered down , template tweaks , removal of resil. , removing of stat choice , removing of PvP gear vendors . Everyone should just quit this turd and not just for this xpack. The PvE furries can have a ball now killing their scripted NPC's with those lackluster legendaries.</div></div><hr />

I this point, if you're still getting emotional about Wow PVP you either can't play a real game because of cost or computer / make money off of streaming or vested interest.. or you're just an idiot. Sorry man.. this thing is all but dead. And that is coming from someone who based on the rawest of percentages has likely played for a lot longer than you have, at a much higher rating than you do.</div></div><hr />

Actually I moved on from WoW 4 months ago but keep I keep reading news about it , hope dies last , im currently playing BF1 with college mates DLC drops in 2 days , Mass Effect Andromeda pre-ordered , premium trial starts in 5 days , im playing all of this at ULTRA settings on 2560x1440p , 144HZ. So all your assumptions just went down the drain right there ( sorry , assumptions just showed yourself you are the idiot ).<br />
<br />
And yea PvP is dead in this game and the season's face an all time LOW number in participation , there has already been a mass unsub exodus you will not see it on this website though since it's the last fanboy frontier outlet. <br />
<br />
Some of us are still hopefull that this turd of expansion will do a 180' and maybe atleast fix PvP which is in shambles.</div></div><hr />

ok, and if the only thing you care about (since you seem to hate anyone and everyone who does pve as you call them furries and imply pve is easy)<br />
then quit, you know pvp is shit, have no intrest in playing, and yes hope dies last but youve lost hope</div></div><hr />
