<br />
WotLK - Inscription on PTR ?<br />
Well, not really the whole inscription professions, but it looks like an inscription spell made it to the 2.4 Test servers : [spell=35043] ! Note that this is the rank 3 of the spell.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/demonicrunes.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/february/demonicrunes.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;a name=&quot;s3req&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Rating requirements will remain on Season 3 items<br />
Rating requirements will probably remain on Season 3 items even after the beginning of Season 4, but they will be lowered.<br />
Q: Will the ratings requirements be removed on the s3 weapons and shoulders next season?<br />
<br />
A: No, and this is new information as far as I'm aware, but the ratings will remain, however they will likely be lowered. Previously we had stated that the ratings would only apply to the current season's items, but that's no longer the current thinking or plans. As it stands currently the rating requirements will remain, but they'll be lowered as the new season's items are introduced.<br />
<br />
<br />
Arena tournament and team switching penalty<br />
It looks like changing members of your team during the 2nd stage of the Arena Tournament will get you a 150 Team Rating penalty.<br />
Right now on the TTR when you change members of a team the team rating is penalized 150 points. When the real Tournament Realm season starts this will only occur during the second stage of the arena season.<br />
<br />
<br />
Lag on Tournament Test Realm<br />
We can not put the vendors in instances because there is no instance server on the TTR. The hardware normally devoted to instances in normal realms is devoted to additional arena space for the Tournament Realms. As I've said before, the hardware and configuration for the arena realm is brand new. Please be patient while we work out the kinks.<br />
<br />
<br />
Incoming changes on TTR<br />
A few things are getting changed in TTR to make it more enjoyable for everyone.<br />
Based on observation and player feedback we will be making some changes to the TTR starting areas to make the NPCs more accessible to everyone. These changes may not make it into the next 2.4 PTR build update but they should definitely be in the following one.<br />
<br />
They're working on the changes right now, I haven't seen them so I really don't know what they're doing yet. And there is no intention of ever allowing world PVP on the Tournament Realms. These realms are for the single purpose of supporting the arena tournaments.<br />

Even tho Badges drop from every bosses now, Kara still is the most Badge/hr you can get.<br />
<br />
My guild clears Kara in about 3h30. So 3h30 for 22 badges...<br />
<br />
I pray for the day blizz implements a 'super-exalted' status, where no mobs are hostile to you... this way i wont have to tank Kara for the 3948th time :(<br />
<br />
Make 25mans give more badge than Kara, and ill be an happy man.<br />
<br />
(My guild is in TK right now, Al'ar just downed. Peeps still need badges for the current and upcomming rewards, so have 2 to 3 groups going to kara each week...)</div></div><hr />

15 badges per gem isnt gonna ruin your prospecting business budddy.<br />

Looking at the bigger picture here, One can see how they are making the previous raid only items and Raid quality gear available via Badge tokens in preperation for Bigger and Better things are on the horizon. Cough cough WotLK, sure may be months away, but this is deff a much better transition then they did with WoW to BC.</div></div><hr />

Get tier 6 gear.<br />
<br />
As for the original post, this sucks, really does. Taking away the last piece of &quot;pride&quot; a raider has. In the next few months there will be no more satisfaction from even trying the end-game instances. Personally i've been waiting for this patch for a long time, my guild and i cleared all the content many months ago, but this patch not only adds a new end-game content side, it also adds an alternative to end-game raiding. That's BoJ loot. Hooray for the so-called &quot;casuals&quot;.<br />

Allright, i will. Thanks for the heads up... ::)<br />
<br />
You'll get plenty of iLvl 154/159/164 items, which i never will.<br />
You'll get plenty of Sunwell Plateau, which i may get once i reach 80.<br />
That should cover your raider's pride.<br />
<br />
For my part, ill be enjoying Hyjal and if im lucky the first few bosses in BT with my iLvl 141 badge items.<br />

Cause conquering this content for your own merit means nothing....really if you guys think if your gear means anything to your fellow gamer, it doesn't. We all play for various reasons, so please stop thinking your having superior gear makes you so much better then other players. Just a heads up, if you continue on in life with this mind set you will constantly be let down.</div></div><hr />

Sry, but clearing Kara in 1:30h is not possible.<br />
<br />
We`re wearing T6, need 38 Minutes to the mount in ZA, but Kara under 2h is not possible.<br />
If WWS is correct we have the second highest Group-DPS recorded and our Kara-Record is 2:01:31h with two rogues wearing the gleves.</div></div><hr />

[/quoute] <br />
<br />
The gear is not an issue, i never did care about the gear, i never cared about it. Maybe you will never get the same iLvl items, but you will get equivalent items with Badges, or just buy the BoE reciepies which drop in Sunwell.<br />

Clear karazhan with mixed alts/mains a couple of times a week on my various chars, [color=red]each run ONLY takes about 1h20 to 1h30.<br />
<br />
Any T6 raiding guild, even bringing alts would not be spreading out a Kara run over a few days, but doing 1 night clears.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow that's a lot of badges to collect... I think I'm up to about 400 needed all said and done. I wonder how far I'll manage to get before WotLK.<br />
<br />
No, as pretty as these gems are, I don't think I'll be buying any. Too many other things that need badges. As for true raiders this sounds like a nice way to top off the gem slots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I already have all the epic patterns - just need gems. And since I'll still be raiding Hyjal/Bt when sunwell comes out, @ 2 badges per boss, thats 10 from Hyjal and 18 from Black temple (odd that Karazhan gives more isn't it?). though I imagine some bosses will give 3 badges.<br />
<br />
So once a week I get 30 badges. Buy two spinels for that, make some +12 spell dmg gem, sell for ~100G = profit. I am really not sure how the market will react.</div></div><hr />

15 Badges is alot. It may not seems so... But it is.<br />
<br />
Your tank gets a new pair of pants, 3 sockets in em (he just spent 100 badges for thoses).<br />
Does he have another 45 badges to throw away to gem em? ... Im sure he'll try to get the 100 badges Chest first. Another Gem needed in that btw. So he's up to 60 badges to gem his new stuff.<br />
<br />
I know *i* will hit the AH for some solid stars and will buy my empyrean sapphires later, when i have badges to spare.</div></div><hr />

Disenchant the BoJ Loot, worked quite well the last times I did it.<br />

<br />
I like the idea of having vendors for the gems. Though I wouldn't mind if the vendor would just allow you to swap gems, like tradeing a green for a red one. Anyways, somethig like the gems, really isn't anything special, doesn't give you any good looks, so I don't mind people getting the gems without paying 900g each.

It died a couple of patches ago ^^<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, what's the pride your talking about? Crafting high-end gems? Was it the only pride you had left? In that case, im 100% with you. Sad Day...<br />
Sad day when it became your only pride too.<br />
<br />
Just a little heads up, as a prot warrior, i can only get 3 pieces of BoJ Loot. Last time i checked on my toon's paperdoll, it had more than 3 slots. <br />
<br />
Do not worry, you won't see me tanking with a Bullwark of Azzinoth. <br />
Do not worry, you won't see me proclaiming ive killed Kil'Jaeden and im 2nd on my server.<br />
I'm too much of a 'casual' for that. <br />
<br />
So me having 3 BoJ pieces and (maybe if i can spare a few thousand gold to buy the epic goggles schems.) a tier2 pair of goggles... will that remove any of the remaining pride you had?<br />
<br />
Im not sure i get you Coocks. Don't think im trying to be a smart ass. I just dont get what you mean.<br />
<br />
And btw, about that term, Casual... we need a new one. Im raiding 4 nites a week, in a slowly progressing guild. The guild is important to me, ive made many internetfriends so to speak, there. Im willing to sacrify 'Seeing Kil'Jaeden dead' for those people. If Blizz gives me a few ways to see the inside of BT, im happy with it and it removes nothing from the fact that you cleared it ages before i will down Naj'entus. You did accomplish something i couldnt. Take pride in what you did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We`re wearing T6, need 38 Minutes to the mount in ZA, but Kara under 2h is not possible.<br />
If WWS is correct we have the second highest Group-DPS recorded and our Kara-Record is 2:01:31h with two rogues wearing the gleves.<br />
http://wowwebstats.com/hw442qfrodgvo 1:58 all but basement boss<br />
http://wowwebstats.com/ah2f1wlxym4e3 1:54 same as previous, sub-2hr clears are most definitely possible - so is Nightbane where he never stays on the ground more than 5 seconds between flight phases (first link).<br />
<br />
I can't really fathom knocking more than 5-10mins off that without flasking and potting up. Our average runs with 6-7mains and 3-4 alts are just over 2 hours. We chainpull as soon as everyone is buffed and don't stop until Prince is dead, and I'm sure other guilds match or beat our pace.<br />
<br />
ZA is just under an hour for 13 badges so it's about the same badges/hr in the end but you can run ZA 3 times some weeks.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that if all high-end raiders would go away, no one would be left to open the way to all the welfare gem/armour/weapon etc. vendors for you?<br />
<br />
That's an interesting thought, btw. Imagine all the raiders would leave the game at the same time, letting the scrubs behind who sit on their 500 farmed badges eager to turn them in for phat lootz.<br />
The loot they don't need, since they don't have the time to actually use it. But they want it nethertheless. And of course they always complain that raiders should only do it for the lore and fun to kill the bosses. *rools eyes*</div></div><hr />

<br />
How exactly do &quot;high-end raiders&quot; &quot;open the way to all the welfare gem/armour/weapon etc. vendors for you&quot;. Also what makes badge gear &quot;welfare&quot; gear in the first place, it takes work and time to farm badges. 500 badges would take weeks of farming even for those in guilds that can clear kara in 2 hours and whatever, why would players not deserve to be rewarded for it?<br />
<br />
It would make very little difference if all of the better-than-thou raiders left the game, they are only a small percentage of the players. The comment I quoted just shows how much this game has gone to some of their heads.... now we should thank the all mighty &quot;high end raiders&quot; for opening up welfare loot for us, GET OVER YOURSELVES LOL</div></div><hr />

Need new term for Casual. <br />
Casuals don't have 500 badges.<br />
I raid 4 nights a week, have 150 badges stacked. Casuals have 25 badges stacked and expecting to get their Icon of the silver crescent in a few weeks. I know, we have some of those, in my guild.<br />
<br />
Also, if im not mistaken, the badge vendor is opened by doing dailies (building the city) where the only thing the immortal essences opens up are the gates in sunwell.<br />
So all leaving at the same time would only mean that the gates would stay closed forever.<br />
<br />
And i do 'need' the loot (and have the time to use it), it'll help my not-so-casual-yet-not-hardcore guild progressing in Late Tier5, early Tier6.</div></div><hr />

Very valid point.<br />
I beleive blizzard is trying to do it in a progressive way.<br />
When the next content gets out, it's tunned tighter.<br />
Over time, they downtune it.<br />
If you are part of 'the good players', you get your hard content right away (when you need it!).<br />
If you are part of 'the less good players', you get your not-so-hard content a few months down the road (when you may need it, or may even not be there yet).<br />
<br />
Pleasing 9 million players is serious business :)<br />

<br />
How is that? Your 'good' players are already in your raiding guild, and your not doing anything w/ the 'less good' players anyways. <br />
<br />
HC Raiders will still be farming thier T6 gear, and still be running the other stuff w/ other guild members. Rarely do you see anyone in a T6 guide doing stuff w/ a pug.<br />
<br />
So, assuming you are right, and average skill goes down, how does that effect you in anyway? Skill level of your guild will remain the same.<br />
<br />
The days of catering just to the HC Raider is gone. Games are not play/pay-by-hour anymore. Companies like Blizzard no longer make more money from raiders then casuals so they cannot just cater to the HCR and still expect a large amount of fee's to sit on. Everyone pays thier $15 a month. And having content only for 2% of players is not good for business. <br />
<br />
Welfare epics doesnt take anything away from your achievements. You'll still be the person who has downed X and X months ahead of 98% of the other people. You will still be the people who were walking around w/ item level XXX months ahead of other people.<br />
<br />
2.4 is likely to be the last BIG update before WotLK. <br />
<br />
What Blizzard is doing is, letting an additional.. say 30% of players see content they wouldnt of seen before. Giving a hand to players, that pay the exact same amount of money, to help do things they were not able to do before. Helping those casual raiders go from T4-T5, or T5 to T6. Them actually clearing them is another story. <br />
<br />
Its basically the casual's last chance to progress, to see/experience these places before WotLK is out.<br />
<br />
Evening out the playing field in preparation for a whole new expansion takes nothing from raiders, as when WotLK comes out in 6-10months time, you'll still be wearing your T7-8 several months ahead of everyone. You'll still be the only ones who have done this/that of the new content. Its time let the casuals enjoy content that previously only 2% of people have been doing for months ahead of them.<br />
<br />
All this complaining has less to do with 'no reason to raid' then it has to do with 'taking away our supposed status symbols, aka item level'. E-Peen much? As big as your epeen is, its still 0's and 1's, aka small.<br />
<br />
Personally, I think its what you've done, what you've accomplished in the game that matters. How fast you've done this, how well you did in that, etc. Not what gear/items you have. The new badge loot takes nothing away from that.</div></div><hr />

Uh..I solo healed a kara full of T5 geared people and we cleared it in 2h 10min, and that was without a shadowpriest. We had a lot of downtime for me to drink and general bsing around, so I 100% believe he's clearing it in 1:30. In fact I'm a little concerned that you arent if your raid is as geared as you say it is, are you still bringing 3 healers?<br />
<br />
As for the subject at hand, I dunno why people are still freaking out about &quot;scrubs&quot; getting into instances they don't belong in or getting all this great gear for little effort. We're at the end of BC, Blizzard is purposefully doing this so they can shove as many people as possible into end game. Come Lich King it'll be all back to normal, and then a year later when Lich King is reaching its end they'll do this all over again and give out T9 level gear from whatever the new badges are and people will freak out again. The leader of the top guild on my server said it best I think when he said &quot;I've been clearing BT for months and I'll clear Sunwell way before any of these other guilds even get close to seeing Illidan...what do I care if they just now get to see Hyjal and BT?&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have six LV70 chars, most of the 90% epic. My main is in a 3/4 5/6 guild with Vashj at 15% yesterday. I also have two more chars at LV60+ (62 and 68). I also have char I do Arena with with a 1900 rating. How is it I'm not hardcore? <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I used to do the hardcore raid game before BC. We got halfway through Naxx before the expansion hit. That's certainly not cutting-edge-raiding, but it's not &quot;LOLZ SCRUB&quot; either. I DO know that many people I used to raid with before BC who were total scrubs (not realizing when mobs had an elemental shield reflected spells, getting boiled in acid at Heigan, aggroing neutral mobs at Twins) are now in Illidan killing guilds. Which is why I - as a restoration shaman for the alliance - never joined those guilds, even though I was asked several times without actually applying. That's restoration shamans on alliance for you.<br />
<br />
I don't even have the TIME to collect all those badges for &quot;BT LEVEL&quot; gear. I'm good enough to realize that Blizzard gimped the &quot;BT Badge&quot; gear intentionally - 2,5 fist weapons and 1,7 speed daggers, while okay, are hardly perfectly optimized.<br />
<br />
But guess what? I don't really care. I took my bar exam and passed in the top 15% a few weeks ago - WHILE raiding in a &quot;scrubby&quot; 3/4 5/6 guild and leveling a ton of alts. <br />
<br />
I guess it all depends on your definition of hardcore. Because if that means that I'm a LOLZ CASUAL EPIXX kinda guy - well, I'm gonna wear that &quot;tag&quot; with pride.</div></div><hr />

Casuals make up something like 60% of WoW's player base, you're QQ'ing because players are getting those extra 5 stats on their gems? So that makes you equal now? Last time I checked BT/Hyjal wasn't serious business. You have Sunwell, and you don't have to put in half as much time in to get the epic gems as casuals do, for the most part, most raids take a day and go into BT and clear it. Not to mention if you spend the time to go farm some trash you're set. The only people who are QQ'ing about this are A. People who were carried to BT/Hyjal. B. People who aren't good in the first place.<br />
<br />
Quit complaining because WoW is feeding epics to Casual players, you're retarded if you think that Blizzard hates raiders, they always give us something new (Aka Sunwell) while Casuals try to pick up on the slack.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, judging from the comments most of these people think guilds that are unable to kill Vashj or Kael right now are going to get new badge gear and BT gems and magically gain the ability to clear BT and Hyjal just because the attunements gone. If they can't even currently kill Vashj/Kael, then they certainly aren't going to get very far in there once they do get in.<br />
<br />
Now if all this gear was made available right at the start of TBC, then this would be a completely different argument, but this close to the end? Whatever, lol.</div></div><hr />

He's not going to be able to get these 100s of badges required for the T6 quality gear and epic gems. The only people able to get so many badges will already be onto the T6 content, and have good enough gear to clear heroics without batting an eyelid, have all 10-man raids on farm, and also be able to farm all the 25-man content. You hardcore endgame raiders will have so many badges you won't know what to do with them. You can get any badge gear you want, and you'll easily be able to get epic gems for badges. For us casuals, who will only do a couple of heroics a week, it will take us weeks to get even one piece of badge gear. If that helps us to get to some of the later content, I applaud it.

LOL Hardcore + pride do not mix. Time to get off your high horse and keep in mind that Blizzard cares more about the majority of players and less about the minority.

If you haven't gotten that far yet (meaning you won't have BT down by 2.4) then I'm sorry you suck too much to be a raider and too much of a whiner to enjoy playing the game for a responsible amount of time like a casual.</div></div><hr />

I always know when someone is good by their guild tag. I know that Guild A and B have cleared BT and do on a regular basis. I've never heard of Guild Z and therefore they are nobodies. You know who has legendary items and you know who rules the roost in PvP. Blizzard giving people Epics doesn't really matter at all. I do wish that Epics were not handed it out as much but it's a simple color change, simply make Karazhan give really good Blues for instance. Some loot, different color. It's all about aesthetics.</div></div><hr />

Quick question: Do you know how good someone is after you Inspect them or before? I'm going to say before because everyone has a floating name and guild tag above their heads. That's your reward. Knowing that you're in a guild that is better than the eleven billion others on your server or around the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only people that will buy these gems for badges are pre-MH guilds.<br />
<br />
All of us in MH/BT get them for free off drops...and if you're not yet in MH/BT you will still change your gear often so its not worth epic gems for that extra +1 stat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
i did not read all pages (yet)<br />
<br />
we're farming bt for like 3 or 4 months. now i just wanted to answer to one of the last comments: we got a lot of people in our guild that no one knows, we're not a raiding guild but a raid composed of 5 or more smaller guilds(with 2-3 bigger ones). so yes, it says something about me, but only if i have the right gear, otherwise i might be a twink or just some guy in this guild(friend, ingame-friend or else)<br />
<br />
on topic: for &quot;casuals&quot; it means doing 4 heroics to get just ONE gem - at least i think that's still a lot of work, worth one gem.<br />
<br />
i don't wanna start qq'in about anything, i just want to point out(like many did before me) that it is true that WoW is getting more &quot;easy&quot; or, let's call it &quot;open for everyone&quot;. <br />
my guess is that they's start similar with wotlk, making it hard and then tuning everything down in the end(well, we don't know when THAT will be), and that people who are/were searching for a challenge will/are get/ting disappointed, no matter how many or few they are.<br />
i'd just hope they put even more content in there. if there was more content(don't know myself if i mean 'raiding' or just everything around) it wouldn't be such a problem with the items then. would be nice if they made wow a bit more &quot;look around, watch, show your skill - like to make it form 59-60 and 69-70 you have a quest that makes you learn and use your class at the max. make items worth more again. doesn't matter if they're green or epic if they're good use.<br />
<br />
oh and then there's itemhunter-freaks like me who played d2 solely for the items...and do the same with WoW.yeh, i'm disappointed now.</div></div><hr />

/agree, i remember when i looked up to people in Naxx gear. they were the skilled people who could put in the effort to kill the high end bosses. i remember looking at BWL gear when i was in a guild that had no hope of even entering MC. <br />
<br />
now my druid got the gear to tank heroics and take little damage just from getting vindicator's PvP gear and a few easy badge runs. hell 2 of the pieces of vindicator's gear i had the honor to get before my druid even hit 70. <br />
<br />
do i deserve high-end epics for doing extremely little stuff pre-70(mostly doing a daily PvP BG and a few BG runs between leveling every day).<br />
<br />
IMO, no. now with S4 coming out, if i leveled up that same druid, i'd be able to get BT quality gear while leveling........<br />
<br />
it's not just badge gear, it's all the easy gear. atleast the badge gear requires skill to get..........nah can't even say that, i did a easy heroic with low skill people in my group. always love those warlocks who chain cast searing pain to do &quot;DPS&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">vexis58</div><div class="date">2008-03-04, 11:55 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This game will always be World of Casualcraft, stop QQing and find a different game if you don't like it. The other 90% of us who haven't seen BT/Hyjal yet will be happy to see this stuff. And hey, if the raiders quit, maybe Blizz will think about giving us some raid-difficulty heroic 5-mans to use all of our epic badge gear for. Magister's Terrace is a step in the right direction.<br />
<br />
And fresh 70s in dungeon blues aren't going to be spending their hard-earned badges on gems, they're going to be spending them on gear. There's enough gear upgrades for badges that by the time any casual player gets enough for all of it, the next expansion will already be out.<br />
<br />
I see this change as an opportunity for those of us who don't need the badge loot, we can use the extra badges gemming our gear, or even sell them for profit. One of the things my priest was angry about after 2.3 was that she had SO MANY badges, but nothing to spend them on. As an Alch/JC I didn't need nethers, and I already had gear from SSC/TK that was better than the badge stuff in 2.3. I love all the options they're giving us now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
4 heroics to get 5 gems in a sense. remember, you get badges, so do those other 4 people. that's one gem per a person. raiders on the other hand would have to wait for 25 gems to drop.<br />
<br />
not to mention then you have gems like pure blue gems that are only great for gems, and green epic gems which are relatively worthless. and then gems like crimson spinels which everyone wants and are the only gem anyone is ever short on normally. yea gems dropping from BT is nice, but you actually get to choose. IMO, i would be a bit happier if they made the badge gems BoP also so that they don't hurt the market of selling BT gems. would also be interesting if it was 15 badges for a gem &quot;bag&quot;, containing 1 random BoP BT gem. of course then you would also have to add in JCers to be able to cut gems through the trade window.<br />
<br />
as for the guild tag, yes it's worth a bit. it's nice to have the guild tag of the 3rd furthest Horde guild Server wide. but in the end some of the special things that raiders got just disappeared. looking at a PvP you can't tell them apart from a PvEr. the warlock T6 wings was totally ruined by a easy S3 helm that has the same thing. Other things like that have destroyed the few things that raiders get to show to others that we have the skill to conquer the content. sadly the only thing we have now is the satisfaction of seeing the bosses and beating them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I agree 100% with that. How can you people even mock on blizzard for doing this? Soon WotLK will come and your epics wont have any value anyways.<br />
And tbh, what would you all do without the casuals and what would the casuals do without the raiders? We all lift the game to what it is and personally i like it, if you dont like it then stop paying for your account and delete your charecters.</div></div><hr />

The bleeding edge raiders tend to forget there's a large &quot;middle class&quot; in WoW between true casuals and the hardcore raiders.

It's unfair to lump the softcore raiders in with the true casuals, as many of these people have the skills to excel should they cross over and go hardcore, but most prefer to be free of the stresses and drama that tend to come with the territory of hardcore raiding. It's these softcores that are being rewarded by Blizzard next patch. If they have the skills, but their gear isn't up to snuff, they can invest in gear that can bring them up to snuff with the members of a raiding guild that would be potentially interested in their services. True casuals will still be in their blues and world drop epics, as most don't care enough about gear to begin with to really make the effort to purchase these items.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well i meant that it is NOT worth as much as that one guy atop said.<br />
<br />
on the gems: we won't ever sell red/orange/blue, so it won't hurt the market anyway, because yellow and green are crap and will remain it(ok, they got a bit more worthy now that there's resi-ones).<br />
<br />
also, i totally agree with you in that the &quot;raider&quot; that was with vanilla wow [[edit:]]DISappeared(parts, at least). i just did not want to say it because it sounds like exactly the qq i did not want to do^^. <br />
did naxx back then(just got trys on sapph, never downed him, cuz of tbc). it was a HELL lot more of work. but i like it more the way it is today. have a flying dragon, get my set atleast much earlier. <br />
i think, you know, me, being a mage, i always wanted to become more &quot;powerful&quot;- yeah sounds dumb in a dragonball-like way, but that's what the game means to me, along with items that help me accomplish that. <br />
<br />
so it saddens me that there's not more/harder content for me to gain that power, knowledge over and of my char, and that there's people out there wo gain that power MAYBE with (much?, dunno) less effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I'm used to only read the news and some comments... but I really had to create a account to ask how exactly &quot;casual&quot; ppl will progress or do anything else without the ones who &quot;waste their life&quot; learning everything before us and writting all those strats in wowwiki, mmochampion, wowhead, etc...??? Well, really, I guess if you're here, it's because you read something about the game to learn something and play better (or at least gear better). And it's not only about raids. Those crazy stuff about skill rotations, etc... for you to read and try to do you job better in a group (dps, tanking, healing...).<br />
<br />
If we're talking seriously here, a &quot;casual&quot; would not have time (and even will power) to spent hours trying to learn the content (what about recording videos, writting strats, etc...?) for others (more casuals than this &quot;casual&quot;?) to read and progress too. That's why they're not the so called &quot;hardcore&quot;. <br />
<br />
Most ppl would just left WoW if sudently every &quot;hardcore&quot; raid ppl left just before WotLK hits. Nobody would wan't to be there paying huge repair bills, leaving the instances with 0 drops, etc... just to learn and teach the new 5-man/10-man/25-man and probably Blizz would finish the game or do some kind of &quot;raid with a GM&quot; promos...<br />
<br />
My guild is just starting TK and SSC. Downed &quot;Loot Bellow&quot; and &quot;Loot Reaver&quot;/Solarian. Going for A'lar. We do use those guides and strats.<br />
<br />
That reminds me of another thing that I still didn't understand. Why those &quot;titles&quot; should not be given only to ppl who actually did all those atunments when they were needed (and probably some bosses were harder)? That way the title would really mean something and would be a really detail to reward those guilds who put up effort in doing that. From what I've saw, Mag will be easier now and I'll be a &quot;Champion of Naruu&quot; just like the ppl who have a hard time doing it before. Weird. I think that the title should be awarded to everyone who has the atunment complete or part of it done when the patch hits live. That way would even look like a &quot;aq gate opening&quot; where those warriors finally opened the gates for reinforcements to come (like A'dal says when someone turn in the verdant sphere - strike the remaining kael'thas forces).</div></div><hr />

i m in a BT raiding guild,we started from scratch 6 months ago and now we are at phase 2 of illidan(the mofo is going down before next patch),while Archi is being farmed every week.<br />
i m playing a rogue and personally i think the new badge pants and the crossbow are the best items for the given slots for a rogue(i ll dare to say the pants are damn nicer than the t6 pants,and defo better than the shaddy dealers leggings).As for the crossbow,its just damn nice ,better than anything u ll find inside BT or MH for the given slot.<br />
So i ll just use my badges(which frankly i can farm like tons with my guildies,since we currently jerg all the badge giving content-gear and skill really helps on that) and benefit from them.<br />
Personally i dont care if the so called casuals get a grip on those as well(i ll have slain illidan!!),while in the meantime i ll have teh badges hot and ready for the vendor when he appears.<br />
<br />
And when all those casuals set foot and start wiping on naj'entus or supremus or azgalor(the previous bosses are piss easy),i ll be venduring inside Sunwell Plateau(where players of my skill are supposed to be when 2.4 goes live)<br />
<br />
All i have to say is Give me new content,i cant wait<br />

And who will make all the strats to kill the bosses for you then? You wouldn't be able to kill a single Karazhan boss without someone holding your hand and painting maps for you telling you where to stand, when to move and what button to push. Then you would have to wait for 1 year again until Blizzard adds more easy welfare epics for you obtainable by some stupid farming. Enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />

There are plenty of people who will raid and aren't loot whores to see content than non-raiders do not get to see. There are plenty of smart players who do not hardcore raid. They don't get world firsts but they get to see everything before it's &quot;too late&quot; (xpack). I know a lot of them come up with their own strat w/o spoiling it for themselves via the internets. There will always be strats, Blizzard would have to remove raids from the game before raiding actually disappeared because of these &quot;welfare casual epics&quot;.</div></div><hr />

In past you was able to buy them from guilds that sells them, and now you will be just able to get some alternative.<br />
Its like what you prefere - farm few hours and buy it for gold, or go farm badges and lose even more time and get it for badges.<br />
<br />
I also cant understand some whinning about those &quot;casuals&quot;. As HC raider myself i just accept and welcome new gear for them. I know that i will get better quality gear from Sunwell Plateua instance, so why bother. Also all new loot that you can get from badges isnt better then my currient t6. Its even more worse. Even with same item lvl...<br />
<br />
And i undestood long time ago that gear can give you something, but you will not get any skill from it.<br />
for example:<br />
You can spend 400 badges and equip your warrior so he will be able to tank archimonde... but you will get feared and raid will wipe becorse of you...<br />
<br />
PS.<br />
We had same &quot;gear buff&quot; patch before tbc with warlord gear for everyone, and then it became useless becorse of tbc release... so same will be with all this badge/crafting imba loot in WoLK...</div></div><hr />

<br />
YAY! You killed Vashj! Have a Gold Medal! We're downgrading that gold medal to bronze next patch.<br />
<br />
Think of it, there is no reason to give out all the items that were previously accessible to only those who do MH/BT. It's the same reasons that people use to describe &quot;why shouldn't casuals&quot;.<br />
<br />
When you raid, you compete against Blizzard's content team and yourself.<br />
<br />
Why shouldn't you get BT quality gear?<br />
It's not because other people cleared it. It's because you can not coordinate yourself to beat the premade encounters! If you don't accomplish anything, why should you get the rewards for it?<br />
<br />
This isn't PvP, where gear levels need to be kept similar to provide a competative progressive environment. This is about the rewards for accomplishments being handed out to people who didn't accomplish anything.<br />
<br />
P.S. &quot;Casuals&quot; will have nearly the same BoJ income as raiders, since the raid bosses will likely drop the same number of badges per person regardless of tier.<br />
<br />
P.P.S. I'm a semi-casual raider. We struggle with Kael and Vashj. We don't think it's OK for us to go into MH before those two are dead.</div></div><hr />

I only raid Karazahn, ZA and Gruul/Magdi, because our people are not Equiped good enough to start SSC and the BT/Hyjal.<br />
<br />
Why i think that blizz makes a good job and the adding new rewards for badges is good. Why it is good, because a causal raider as iam can skip the t4 rewards and get geared faster. Ok i will take the rewards when the drop, i will geht my s1 set than faster with 2.4.<br />
<br />
When i pick up the rewards for t6 content with t6 similar rewards, there will be faster to get SSC and Hyjal cleared and our guild can go temple. <br />
Iam a tank and my gear needs to be the best one, because iam standing there at the front and I tank the bosses ;)<br />
<br />
We are wiping at the moment at gruul and thats not fun. I start to pick up badges, but i will buy the gear but i need time. I can do 3-6 heroics a day, but not everyday. I had other things to do.</div></div><hr />

We're at the end of BC, Blizzard is purposefully doing this so they can shove as many people as possible into end game. Come Lich King it'll be all back to normal, and then a year later when Lich King is reaching its end they'll do this all over again and give out T9 level gear from whatever the new badges are and people will freak out again. The leader of the top guild on my server said it best I think when he said &quot;I've been clearing BT for months and I'll clear Sunwell way before any of these other guilds even get close to seeing Illidan...what do I care if they just now get to see Hyjal and BT?&quot;<br />
QFT.<br />
<br />
Also, hardcore players will be in Sunwell and have killed the first 3 bosses already when the badge gear comes out. Badge gear is only for a few slots and not really better than BT gear (except for a few classes/specs), which itself is lower than Sunwell gear.<br />
Hardcore raiders WILL have their unique status items (well, until S4 comes out).<br />
<br />
The one who might complain would be the raiders currently learning MH/BT, but even then (as a raid leader in a guild having just down Vashj for the first time) what i see is how those items are going to help us progress.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
So, you meant that there will always be someone to give the stuff for you in the end without you doing anything. Nice thinking.<br />
<br />
Someone that will help you progress and after that you bash those same ppl telling them to leave 'cause you don't need them for anything else.<br />
<br />
&quot;There will always be strats&quot; - If all that is left are ppl who can't commit themselves to spent hours trying to learn the encounters, how do you think &quot;there will always be strats&quot;? You mean that blizzard will start putting &quot;how to&quot; in their site? No. (well, the way things are going, probably yes).<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vilfort</div><div class="date">2008-03-05, 12:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No point in arguing with these so called &quot;Hardcore&quot; (Hardcore whiners more like it) Raiders thinking its WoW Armageddon. They have lived in their hyped up illusionary world and think this is real life and all their efforts and glorius gear means anything to anyone and Blizzard. they won't accept that this is Blizzards game, they wont be happy unless they think its World of Timecraft. Tired of listening to all your whines, and your bitching and your complaining. You fail to realize you are the biggest benefactor of these changes. I know so many Raiders that had this on farm the last few months and they are most friendly, helpful people. These true hardcore raiders could care less about these changes, cause they Know they have the most to gain from it. So those to you who complain. <br />
Now, I think we all agree that there should be a balance to this. What Blizzard is currently doing is making an effort less and less worth it. They've done this since TBC was released, and as some people said inhere they do it to make the casuals or semi-casuals keep playing. It will mean that they'll lose the huge group of players that are semi-hardcore, people that are in MH and BT by now after 8 months of hard work, but they'll keep the hardcore raiders, they always do. Why? Because the hardcore raiders are the ones that can afford to not care about this, they will still have superior gear etc. The semi-hardcores are the ones losing here. They might have worked on their char for 8-9 months and got a few pieces from BT and MH, and now they'll have to face people that couldn't get out of Karazhan getting equivalent gear. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
LEAVE! please do! don't let the door hit ya on the way out, you guys are what really brings this game down in the dumps. Blizzard, WoW and the rest of the gaming community don't need the likes of you. WoW not your cup of tea? enter common sense, move on try something else. But as always Common sense seems to be severely lacking with most people. <br />
Thing is, originally WoW was a game in which commitment payed off. So why didn't people that couldn't take that leave in the first place? But they didn't, they stayed and whined and even made their 12 year old kids play so they could whine with them. The game has lost its meaning by now. Cause unlike what some people say, there's more to a game like this than &quot;fun&quot;. It might be escapism (which is why I named my first guild just that), but if we spend 4-6 hours a day on something, we'd all like it to be somewhat serious. I mean, would the kids even play if there wasn't ppl to &quot;look up&quot; to? So please, oh please, if you don't want a game in which gearing up matters, play something else. The whole concept of this game (to gear up and overcome challenges) is not fit for people that only wants 100% fun - Blizzard are still trying to make it so, but they're simply making the game more and more shallow, in not to long it'll be so shallow that nobody wants to play, not even the ones that go around thinking that they don't want an effort to pay off - cause they'll wake up and find that even the fun goes away when there's nothing to work for anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
ProTip: There is a life outside of WoW, its Called RL and it does still exist and go on with or with out you. Perhaps you should try to re join society and learn to live with humans. Your WoW progression also does not matter in RL get over yourselves. <br />
<br />
Joining a guild is like joining a sportsclub or whatever. Nobody is saying that you must stop living because you play wow, it's perfectly normal to have timeconsuming hobbies. When u play footie, u wanna win too, don't you? Even if you're not playing for Barca...</div></div><hr />

Should I cry because little Tommy has a better Highscore in Super Mario Brothers than I do ? No, because it's silly.<br />
<br />
Same thing here. Who in their right state of mind cares what other players will get. Raiders got it first, raiders will get it first. And as time progresses, Blizzard enables easier access to whatever. Been so all the time, this will continue.<br />
<br />
It's not bad. It doesn't take anything away from you (unless you imagine something being taken away from you with this change, but then... see above, get real and realize this is a video game)<br />
<br />
If you feel you get cheated out of some imaginary value, then better quit the game right now, because the next expansion is nearing soon and believe you me, the first measly green gem that will drop in Northrend will probably have the same stats as Crimson Spinels do now. OH NOES! CASUALS getz the coolz stuff meant only for ME!<br />
<br />
Please don't throw all the raiders in the same pot. There are idiots on any level. We have content clear since October. I look forward to this change.<br />
<br />
For those not knowing what to do with these gems, let's look at it this way: If they are not BoP, then all your many BoJ's just have become quite some value, as you can certainly sell them in the AH then. And BoJ's will drop even in raidinstances come 2.4.</div></div><hr />

Yes this is true, but you forget somthing. The causal players are 90% off WoW TBC. Yeah there are 90% off. Some of the causals like me never been at the temple.<br />
Perhaps with 80 i go there to see it.<br />
I do not care if i get the first kill on Illidan or something else. But i want to see the content.<br />
I agree that the content is difficult, you need well geared people for it 25 off it.<br />
This is only a game and not real life, and the causals want to see some content. <br />
They are paying for the game as well as the raiders do. Blizz can lose some raiders, but not the causals. <br />
There might be 5% raiders the rest is causals and there are more than 90% of players are causals (ore semi causals). When you do nothing for the causals they leave the game. And this is the strategy blizz makes. They will that the causals will not leave, because they will lose very very much of money. <br />
<br />
This is only a game, and stop whining about that the causals getting something and the raiders not. The causals are paying the same fee.</div></div><hr />

It has become less special. Previously it was PvE raiding that got you the cool gear and now you can get mostly similar items by killing other players instead of raid-bosses.<br />
<br />
Either is cool really. Whatever makes you happy - play the way you like it. If you can't stand that then you play somewhere else. <br />
<br />
That they get gear thou doesn't really bug me. I don't PvP so what do I care about them. The only thing that does bug me a bit is that the game has become so totally unbalanced between PvE and PvP. Being PvE and meeting some PvP person out and about in the world and you are going to get creamed, with them stacked to the max with resiliance and stamina the pve persons hit, crit and dmg stats will be a piss in the ocean. Even while wearing T6/T6 equivalent gear I can't overcome that, mayby it's L2P factor but I seriously doubt that when all your damage gets mitigated to nothing and they have HP like a lv73 elite mob. That they get epic gems, gear for badges of whatever is really not a concern. It's the balance between the two that has become messed up that bugs me to some extent.</div></div><hr />

WOW has always been about achieving goals with a group of guildies/friends. Bliz has always been about giving you the options to achieve these goals by the means you decide are best for you. If you are guild stuck in SSC, the welfare rewards will give your guild a nice boost and help you see some more of the endgame content before the expansion hits. If you are in a HC guild and have been farming BT for months, what should you care about how others get to that goal? <br />
<br />
I'm in a guild with a nice raiding core currently working on Kael, and guess what, even if he isnt downed before 2.4 goes live, we still wont be going to BT or MH because most of us are in this for the challenge and the experience of clearing every dungeon and mastering every boss. And if you are a regular raider you should know that loot only takes you so far - getting decked out in BT quality welfare loot isnt going to give you an iWin button to down tough bosses.<br />
<br />
It seems people worry too much, with a bitter twinge of jealousy, about what other people do and how they do it - who gives a flying fuck about what others do? WOW is about how you and your friends enjoy progress through the game, nothing else should matter.</div></div><hr />

anyone who is actually a serious raider has had a year at level 70 to do what they wanted to do and farm serious gear. expansion time, baring the odd item it will all be &quot;reset&quot; anyway, so what the hell does it matter if i few more people who were never anywhere near your gear standard get a few upgrades before then.<br />

having better gear in wow than the person next to you in the bank does not make you special in some way, so be concerned about yourself and not generic hunter x.<br />

So IMO i like the idea of badge gear thats on semi par with t6 etc/bt loot. I was main tank of a very large guild for almost 10 months of BC and i hated seeing that ppl could get gear from badges/pvp/crafted that was better or equivelent to raid gear, But now i see for the most part why there doing it.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KCee</div><div class="date">2008-03-05, 04:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There is simple reason why people dont like epic gems for badges:<br />
<br />
epic gems are available for raiders who killed Kael/Vashj and something after<br />
<br />
epic gems are available for those who didnt killed Kael/Vashj but because of removing attunement they can farm gems from hyjal/Bt if they are able to make a raid<br />
<br />
epic gems are for anyone, go kara and get epic gems<br />
<br />
<br />
Epic gems were available for any casual that may of ebay'd gold anyways way before this patch ever hits live anyways. All they need to do is look on the AH.<br />
<br />
Whats the difference between farming 20 Primals in 2-3 hours to sell for 500g, and farming heroics for 2-3 hours for 15 badges? <br />
<br />
Only difference is there's no extra gold in the pockets of the HCR. I see no reason for the huge QQ.<br />
<br />
Gold in TBC is a joke anyways when you can make 120g+ doing 10 dailies a day, PER char.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devia</div><div class="date">2008-03-05, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hey! I'm sure many of us have played the old Warcraft and Starcraft games. Remember those times where you got so fed up because a scenario was too difficult to beat? Well, I'm sure we've all pulled out our strategy guide now and then and typed in those lovely little cheat codes and got free gold, free units, fast buildings, and even the famous &quot;God Mode&quot;. <br />
<br />
I remember doing this now and then and having fun with everything being easy, but then after a while I got bored of it and either played a different game or restarted without cheats. Why? Because there was nothing to work for, everything was free, so what was the point?<br />
<br />
Now I realize that things aren't exactly becoming &quot;free&quot; in patch 2.4, but everything will be extremely easy to get with just a bit of time commitment. In fact, I know I've played heroics where there is someone in the party who basically does nothing and gets &quot;pulled along&quot; by the rest of the group. And guess what? They get badges, therefore they get free loot.<br />
<br />
Now, I've been playing this game for 3+ years and unfortunately I've never been in a steady guild that could take on new content. I always have had bad luck with guilds falling apart etc. I'm telling you this because I've never been one of those people with the best gear on the server, but I still understand where these people are coming from.<br />
<br />
TO THE RAIDERS: Don't get too upset. You've spent a year being level 70 and pushing through all the new content, and people still realize and admire that. I'm in &lt;Fallout&gt; on BDF as a guild friend and I get tells all the time from people saying &quot;Wow...you're in Fallout? Man that's so cool - what are the req to get in?&quot; People will always admire raiding guilds. And guess what - when WotLK comes out all of your gear will probably be replaced by level 80 5 man gear. Then there will be new raid dungeons that you can defeat. It's been like this since the old days - MC became the &quot;noob&quot; dungeon once AQ40 and Naxx came out, and then PvP gear became easy to obtain that was better for PvE than PvP gear in TBC is. So, just hang in there!<br />
<br />
TO THE CASUALS: Yes, it's exciting that good gear is becoming attainable for anyone. You don't have to raid to get similar gear. You don't have to be good at PvP to get good PvP gear. But...when you have all that gear and those gems, what's there left to work for? Isn't the fun in a game the fact that you have to work at it to be rewarded? The only way to advance in this game past 70 is by getting better gear. If there was some form of alternate advancement (which inscriptions might make this plausible) then perhaps raiders wouldn't have the need to be worried about casuals getting gear. But please be understanding that everyone's only way to advance is gear. So if everyone on the server, good, bad, casual, and hardcore players alike all have the same gear? Well...what's the fun in that?<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long post. I hope this helps people to think about things in both perspectives a little more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On my server, Black Dragonflight, the epic gems are still difficult for the raiders in raiding guilds to obtain for all their gear. There are rarely any epic gems on the AH, maybe one or two throughout the course of one day. So in that case, up to this point pretty much just raiders have gotten a hold of them, and BDF is a pretty old server with lots of Hyjal and BT guilds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One or two a day, is still about 7 a week. More then enough for any casual w/ gold to slot thier 'rare quality gear'/'heroic epics' w/ epic gems within 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's ONE person...so like, 12 people getting epic gems in all their gear in 6 months (and by that time they would have replaced some gear and would no longer have epic gems every slot). And the gems that are being sold are almost always green or yellow.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Argobot</div><div class="date">2008-03-05, 05:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well my little guild rolled around in the dirt, AKA Grulls and first few bosses of SSC TK for a while, we all did heroics daily and stock piled points and stuff in pvp. In January we finaly killed Alar and then the new badge loot realy opend up a whole new world. <br />
<br />
We killed Kael for the first time last week, Downed him again this week, Vashj has been dead for 3 or so, now we're finaly getting the members apping to our casual guild and the gear (thanks to BoJ loot) to experiance MH/BT. the BoJ loot gave our tanks the kicker they needed, dps and healers all a boost. <br />
<br />
Now we're all MH attuned and getting ready to run in there and get our free BT passes of Rage tomorrow.<br />
<br />
We also know despite the skill levels of alot of our players we wish to remain casual, progression is fun but not the main goal. We started last year with TBC as an offshoot from the number one guild on the server, we were all tired of being done with progression before new stuff came out, hopefully this way with the badge loot it will help us maintain our fun slower pace and get through Illidan and Archemond, possibly even through Sunwell before WotLK comes out. <br />
<br />
We're not scrubs, but we arent hardcore. Keeping our paces slow the BoJ loot will let us see end game. And I think Blizzard as much as anyone wants the people that pay them to get to see the content they worked long and hard to make.<br />
<br />
So thanks Blizz for making it possible to see the cool stuff without being insane raiders.<br />
<br />
PS with a Pally tank and t5 it takes our best group of mains 2 hours and 5 minutes to get through Karazhan. <br />

<br />
Wow is not a car. WoW is only a game. Get a real life.<br />
<br />
Edit: Something else. You raiders think you are somthing better because you kill Illidan and Archimonde. <br />
But this is nothing, this is only a game. Killing something in a game shows nothing about you.<br />
Iam a raider too, but iam starting and i´ve another meaning of this.<br />
<br />
<br />
so what are you trying to tell me?<br />
sorry for the late response btw, I just came home from work half an hour ago (that's 7 pm in germany).. so much for my real life, but you already knew that I don't have none, right?<br />
<br />
The point is, you are not paying for epic gear. Paying for epic gear would be like buying an already completed game.<br />
You are paying for services, like gm support, running servers, new content, etc. There is no such thing as equivalence. Blizzard provides the options, it's up to you what you do with them. Everybody with a running account can raid and obtain phat lewts. <br />
<br />
Equivalence only hurts the game, for some reason people think that it's the way to go. For example, mage gets iceblock for free. All the morons start posting threads in forums, demanding that, for example, rogues should learn preparation from the trainer, warlocks soul link etc.<br />
Why?<br />
Because mages got it, too!!! Very good point, isn't it?<br />
Totally absurd. Maybe people realise this when the patch hits that's making every class the same with all the abilities/mechanics in the game. <br />
<br />
The next patch, because of so many nerf threads, every class only got autoattack.<br />
Yay, balanced game! But who will play it?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bandi</div><div class="date">2008-03-05, 07:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not sure why there are people out there that have a problem with this. Blizzard is just trying to make the current content more accessible for the current players before WOTLK comes out. Gems for badges isnt going to make or break current raiding. The new gear upgrades isnt going to make or break current raiding. Neither is gear that costs twice as much as current badge of justice rewards. People are still going to have to work for their badges because even though they can get more badges now, they still have to work to get them. <br />
<br />
What you have to keep in mind with this added content and easier access... There are still guilds out there that have yet to clear Karazhan. Not all realms are progressed as much as the older ones. The server I am from Azuremyst, has yet to clear BT. Though I hear that at least one guild on the horde side is up to Illidan now. Go Rebellion! <br />
<br />
Everything being added in this patch is just to get players more prepared for WOTLK. You guys that have BT on farm, you get to play around with Sunwell, and the rest of us MIGHT make it to SSC/TK or Hyjal if we are lucky before WOTLK. <br />

<br />
1) Why do raiders assume that non-raiders want to be raiders but for some reason arnt good enough to be raiders?<br />
<br />
2) Do raiders realise that some people don't want to be raiders and *gasp* dont enjoy raiding?<br />
<br />
3)Why is time spend raiding seen as any more valid that time spend doing anything else? <br />
<br />
I assume raiders enjoy raiding and get rewards, People who enjoy heroics do heroics and get rewards and PVP enhusiasts PVP and, hey guess what, get rewards. Why is this a problem and why cant the rewards be equal in value to the players in question? The monthly fee is the same no matter what you do.<br />
<br />
Ok thats actually more like 5 questions but I await the answers with baited breath.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Raiding takes 25 people who are skilled at their class, have to learn specific duties for specific encounters, know how to work well with others, and are required to buy pots, food, etc, spend 4-6 hours a night as well as 50-100g in repair bills. People who are bad and cannot get into raiding guilds due to lack of skill/poor attitude etc do not do this. People who are unskilled at their class can still PvP and do heroics and get pro gear. Why shouldn't raiders get gear that is at least somewhat better? If you just don't have time to raid then so what? Those who do have the time get a reward for it - perhaps something they have access to that others don't? Like epic gems perhaps. Even so, the fact that epic gems until 2.4 only drop in BT doesn't mean that no one else can have them, it just means that raiders will have access to the gems first, and non-raiders will have to pay a price to get them. And that money used to buy the gems goes to the pots...food...repair bills...that the raiders had to sacrifice in order to GET the gems...<br />
<br />
Why should 3 different groups of people doing 3 different types of playing (raiders, hardcore pvpers, casuals) all have access to the same gear?</div></div><hr />

I hear this over and over - why do you insist that non-raiders are &quot;bad&quot;. Maybe they don't want to raid - I have raided at L60 and it's just not my thing -I dont care who gets what loot in all honesty - but i do object to constantly being treated as some kind of second class citizen by the &quot;raiding elite&quot; . It is a choice to raid if you have the time and comitment - i have enough time to raid and am quite capable of playing my class thankyou - I just choose not to. <br />
<br />
And no - not the exact same kit, but the same level of kit - why not , why would you deny someone else some kit. It has no effect on you whats so ever. <br />

<br />

Yay, balanced game! But who will play it?<br />
<br />
<br />
I do not want to blame you. Iam playing the game for fun. I have 3 alt 70 and all are epic Equiped. Hmm.... Iam playing for fun, not for items. The items are a nice to have after playing fun.<br />
My Rouge and Druid are (most full) PVP Equiped, but i do not like pvp anymore, i do it every week for arena, but thats not the point. I love tanking and i love to be a group leader i love to get through the instance and get better gear.<br />
I like to test new bosses, with new taktik. I will try the 5er instance the magister without any guides, because i like to try how the bosses are how the mobs are.<br />
My best friends will go there with it and they want to try it too, they want to do something unusual.<br />
And I like to play with the people and like they say, you´re good. Thats sounds good to me, and thats fun for me to be a good skilled player.<br />
<br />
Compare raiders and causals do not fit, because this sucks. Comparing spells and abilities is not the same as raiding and pvp. Raiding is difficult yeah, but arena is difficult too, but thats not the point.<br />
It is not fair to compare the two kind of people. Different people have different meaning and different time to play. This is only a game and you should play for fun not for items. Have i mentioned that causals are ~90% off the wow players.<br />
Iam a semi raider, iam workin 6 days a week, and can only play in the evening. 3 days i can raid, the other day i make pvp and do other things or iam jobing/or do reallife get out ;).<br />
Iam want fun. Iam raiding heroics so much i can even look at them, but i doing them, for what? not for the items, my tank is allready epic equiped. Perhaps for enchanting or for the faction. Or perhaps for badges for new items.<br />
<br />
I think it is a good idea to get new rewards for semi-raiders likes me, why i think is so. Because i want to try Gruul/ZA this will get easier with new items. Iam working on the ZA rewards, and hmm this is not fair that ZA has been not out long, but who cares, i get the rewards because i like them.<br />
<br />
What you are loosing when the patch goes live?? Nothing you have t6 or other good gear and the causals like me will get the gear perhaps i 2 months, than you have finished sunwell. Hmm.. thats fair no, but i have not time for a full raiding, thats the point. I want fun, and not hardcore raiding for something. I like to raid but thats not the problem. I want equip for my time i do. <br />
I think blizz makes a mistake that the complete t4 drops by gruul/magdi.<br />
When they are perhaps more 10er instances i will go in the new one, but this is a problem i find out with BC.<br />
<br />
And many people have not much time too, and that´s another point. In WoW you need time. it doesn´t matter than i will have one epic in 4 weeks through arena. You can have 1 epic in one kara run once a week or the bagdes.<br />
And sorry but i have 200 Bagdes hmm i will buy something and get 75 bagdes again and again. And what do with 200 bagdes when you have everything??<br />
Perhaps buing a t5 or t6 piece will be nice for 200 bagdes. yeah i think this will be great idea, but or sorry the raiders will whine more about this. <br />
There are not many 10er instances and this is the problem. Our guild tries to take gruul/magdi but we havn´t enough motivated people to do it because i do not know RL perhaps?.-<br />
<br />
Perhaps you do not try to understand the causals, because you have close your eyes and do not seen anything. This is only a game and everyone who pays for it wants fun. Iam not paying for the epics, only for the fun, the epics is a nice to have.</div></div><hr />

You get a lot of skill there so you have the item which compares your new skill. You can be proud of it.<br />
Are you proud of Kara farming? lol<br />
<br />
Buy some items for badges, to progress faster is a good choice.<br />
<br />
But to be proud of what you have done, you only get this feeling from learning to kill the bosses in Raid instanzes You never where bevore or be a PVP owner^^<br />
<br />
<br />
Your are now a better player = You now have the right to get better equip!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
This was a fucking good system and everything goes right if we can just walk in this direction.<br />
<br />
You don't have the skill to work on greater things than Kara = you now get better equip!!!!!!!<br />
For what? For 3h a week! Be proud of this...lol!<br />
<br />
I will farm sometimes for the badges, to progress faster. I hope I can kick this items as fast as i can. So I do it not for myself, I do it for the Raid DPS. I am not proud to do this.</div></div><hr />

He starts with a cheap rusty car, learns how to operate it, and then learns what he can and can't do with it. He travels far, watches people drive, asks questions, takes some driver training and over time gets better and better. Over this time he also upgrades the car time and time again until one day he has a shiny high performance ride that is crafted with care and well maintained. People like to ride with Mr. X because he knows what he's doing, and has a nice machine.<br />
<br />
Mr.X then turns his focus to trucking, and of course isn't terribly good at it but he's seen people drive trucks before. He asks a few questions and uses his experience to figure some things out, then roars around and quickly searches out his upgrades, going from a cheap rusty truck to an amazing one that is crafted with care and well maintained much more quickly than with his car. People still like to ride with Mr. X, because he still knows what he's doing.<br />
<br />
Now Mr. Z has never driven before either, and is not very good at all when he starts. He also begins with a cheap rusty car, but simply fumbles with the controls and lurches around the block in first gear a few times, then is handed a high performance engine. He goes around that same block many more times, and much later has an entire high performance car. However, Mr.Z hasn't taken the time to ask questions or learn how to be a good driver, and often gets into crashes for silly reasons although he's picked up the basics. People don't like to drive with Mr.Z because although he has a nice machine and thinks himself a good driver, he's inept.<br />

I enjoyed playing with 40 other people back in the days of Molten Core. But now, I'm starting my own business and I formed a guild with my 3 brothers and sister in law. There are just 5 of us, and we like it that way. We live very far from each other so I see WoW as a way to hang out with one another again. But work has taken it's toll on my playing time, and having the opportunity to get rewards for my badges is a godsend for me and my tiny guild. We don't have the numbers to raid, and we don't really want them. We don't have the time to raid, but we all pay the same 15 bucks that every one else does, so why should we be excluded from seeing endgame content, or at least getting decent gear? I still have to farm for around 500 badges just to get all that I would need from the new loot, isn't that a lot of work? It definitely means I will have to farm heroics for a loooong time before I can see the fruits of my labors. Isn't that the same in terms of the money, time and effort invested by a raider? I appreciate Blizz going out of it's way to ensure that me and my fledgling guild can also enjoy the feeling of having high level gear. I won't ever see a Warglaive on my rogue, I won't ever see T6.

<br />
Pretty accurate aswell.<br />
<br />
<br />
I will be collecting badges on my Alt because the gear is so damn pro and i dont have the time to bring my alt through ssc/tk n gear her up.<br />
<br />
I will not be getting any on my main though, a few of the items are upgrades but i like to feel ive been rewarded for somthing when i get a new epic upgrade. The reward for clearing kara yet again should be half a turnip with &quot;same time next week&quot; carved into it.<br />
<br />
Giving these rewards out is not such a bad idea as it will give people a viable way to gear up a little faster and, provided they arnt a guild full of morons, progress a little faster and see the end game.<br />
<br />
But... for christ sake blizzard, at least make them a tincy wincey bit harder to obtain rather than saying &quot;here you go youve just farmed the easiest level 70 instance again have some t5 equivalent loot&quot;. <br />
<br />
Give people some satisfaction and pride when they recieve there loot, just in the hope that some of these &quot;casuals/scrubs&quot; whatever they are being called these days O.o actually want to work for there epics and not get spoon fed loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;epics cant buy you skill&quot; - Fact</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">baguette</div><div class="date">2008-03-06, 10:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why should 3 different groups of people doing 3 different types of playing (raiders, hardcore pvpers, casuals) all have access to the same gear?<br />
<br />
<br />
Because the &quot;casuals&quot;, I would estimate, are like 90% of all the ppl playing.<br />
Players = $$$$.<br />
Blizzard want´s $$$$. <br />
<br />
Problem is, most &quot;casuals&quot; have already full-geared 1,2 or even 3+ chars with 5man/badge/kara-loot.<br />
<br />
And therefore, they (Blizzard) need to create a reason for all those ppl to stay in WoW in the meantime before WOtLK.<br />
<br />
It´s kinda obvious, and this new thing with epic gems for badges just confirms it, it´s their try to make badges/5-man instances last a bit longer so ppl don´t stop play WoW.<br />
<br />
In the process, they give the few % of end-game raiding ppl a big slap in the face, but since everything is about $$$ they rather make the big chunk (i.e &quot;casuals&quot;) happy.<br />
<br />
Sad but true.</div></div><hr />

Iam not a real causal. I have time to play most everyday, but iam not have time to raid every day. Thats why i called me a semi causal. A player that have enough time to raid once oder twice/tripple a week, but do not have enough time to raid every day. I play everyday but make dailies or pvp. Timesink iam playing for fun.<br />
<br />
when you are working every day in the week, you have no time for raiding for extreme raiding. This makes me sad, but wayne ;)</div></div><hr />
