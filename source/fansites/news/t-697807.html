Official Notes Update<br />
The official patch notes (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23329393385-ptr-patch-333-notes.html) have been updated with more changes. Only the new changes are listed below.<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Holiday bosses (such as Ahune for the Fire Festival) will now be accessible through the Dungeon Finder.<br />
Players must use the Dungeon Finder or speak to special holiday NPCs in the world to queue up and access these bosses.<br />
Upon accepting a queue for any holiday boss, the party will be ported directly to the necessary area for confronting that boss.<br />
The previous summoning criteria for these bosses have been removed. Players can queue up for and fight each World Event boss as many times as they want for any standard loot that they may drop.<br />
All rare holiday items (such as The Horseman's Reins) will have a chance of being found in holiday-themed loot troves which will drop once for each player in the party no more than once per day, in the same manner that doing the Random Dungeon daily quest will provide a specific reward the first time it is completed in a day.<br />
<br />
Companion Pets<br />
The Pet Bombling and Lil' Smoky non-combat pets are no longer Bind-on-Pickup.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-death-knight/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Chains of Ice: The ability now innately applies Frost Fever to a target. <br />
Frost<br />
Icy Talons: The personal haste benefit provided by this talent is no longer exclusive with other sources of melee haste. This will allow death knights to always swing 4/6/12/16/20% faster when Frost Fever is applied. Windfury Totem and the party/raid component of Improved Icy Talons still do not stack. <br />
Unholy<br />
Unholy Blight: In addition to its previous effects, this talent now also prevents diseases from being dispelled from victims afflicted by Unholy Blight.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-druid/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?druid))<br />

Ferocious Inspiration: This ability is now an aura and provides 1/2/3% damage to all party or raid members within 100 yards and boosts the damage of Steady Shot by 3/6/9%.<br />
<br />

Slaughter from the Shadows: Now adds 1/2/3/4/5% damage to all attacks and reduces the energy cost of Backstab and Ambush by 4/8/12/16/20, up from 3/6/9/12/15. <br />
Waylay: The debuff from this talent can now be caused by Backstab in addition to Ambush and can be triggered by all hits from these abilities rather than just critical strikes, but the snare component is now 50%, down from 70%.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
probably is also for internal use only, meaning Blizz is planning on keeping track of who kicks people, and why, and even when. Chances are people will be warned if they are being too loose with kicks or if they are kicking someone right before the last boss, ie kicks in Forge of Souls last boss because of Needle trinket.</div></div><hr />

DKs depend on diseases far more than most classes. All of their damage is modified by diseases. As of now, DKs are doing pretty bad damage even with diseases.. no diseases is just ignorable.<br />
<br />
This change isn't passive. First you need RP and cast Death Coil every 10 seconds so Unholy Blight doesn't fall off. These changes are little compared to what is needed though.<br />
<br />
Unholy still needs dependable burst. Unholy has pretty nice constant damage, but that doesn't win arena matches, burst does.<br />
<br />
Frost needs Frost Fever undispellable. Probably put it in Endless Winter now since CoI putting up Frost Fever is passive now.<br />
<br />
Blood would need the most changes and would probably not happen this expansion. Probably the least viable spec in the game and would require a ton of work into it</div></div><hr />

I wonder if there are some, in some form, already. Either way, I was so upset at the one time I had to abandon. I felt really uncomfortable about it and was upset that I had done it. I was just about to enter a dungeon and got ganked. I didn't leave queue, cause I thought I'd make it back to my body in time, before the dungeon was up. And, I did, but I got ganked again. Paladin OPness for the win. And, the dungeon popped. I was having trouble getting back to my body, as it was fairly far away and in a cave. And, I felt badly, making the group wait for me. So, I just told them that I had been ganked and apologized, then left the dungeon. :( <br />
<br />
I don't even know what dungeon it was, since I couldn't enter yet, being that I was dead. So, I didn't abandon due to dislike for the specific dungeon or anything at all like that, whatsoever. I just didn't want to hold everyone up, while I did a corpse run. D: Now, I wish I had just left the darn queue. I hope that those sort of things are taken into account, with these stat trackers. I hope that they give a small cushion of times to abandon. Assuming that things do happen. Like, you enter and you're at Uni, but a firedrill goes off. Or, you spill something all over your keyboard and desk. Or, you get a knock at the door and it's important. Etc? <br />
<br />
I've only abandoned that one time, ever. But, I still feel uncomfortable about it. :(</div></div><hr />

Yes, unless they change the way the pet works, the only thing that made it exclusive to engineering was the BoP from crafting. There is no actual requirement for learning the pet itself.<br />

Unholy is the disease tree, its damage isnt just linked to diseases, it depends on them. Blood and Frost arent nearly as dependant.

I'll tell you when those clowns will be satisfied:<br />
Death Knight:<br />
) Stamina has been increased by 80%<br />
) Normal melee attacks cause tripple damage on all non Death Knight classes.<br />
)Chains of Ice doesn't cost Frost Rune, nor Runic Power. It is now spammable.<br />
)Due to being the Hero Class, Death Knight has a 90% chance to cause an Execute to the target's HP, killing 3 people at the same time, regardless of what HP the targets has.<br />
)Diseases has been changed to Physical debuffs, and each one of them cause a damage like what Curse of Doom does every 2 seconds.<br />
__________________________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________<br />
<br />
Paladins:<br />
<br />
)Bubble now lasts 5minutes, up from 12 seconds, and the melee attack penalty has been removed.<br />
)Added an interrupt for the Loladins, called Faceroll freeze: Has a 2 Seconds CD and Silences the target for 1 Minute<br />

<br />

True.<br />
<br />
But it's a free market, and if you look at the materials, you'll see most of them also require engineering to be made. Unless they're camping all the engineering vendors for Gyrochronatom's, Fused Wiring, and Big Iron Bombs, it's going to take more than 5g of your time to make them one. If you're accepting 5g tips for Choppers, or anything you craft for that matter, the problem lies with you or your server, and not the change itself.<br />
<br />
As for mass selling in the AH, that really wasn't my plan either, but as P.T. Barnum used to say, &quot;A sucker is born every minute.&quot; There is also something to be said about those who are willing to just buy it out of convenience, rather than farm Gnomeregan, or have jewelcrafters and engineers get some fused wiring, and then sit there while you craft each individual part. <br />
<br />
Hell, if i saw one in the AH for 100g i'd buy it without thinking. No need to look up &amp; buy all the individual mats, no need to waste time in trade or guild trying to find someone who can make it (assuming i didn't have an alt with the patterns already) and then no wasted time sitting by the forge, waiting on someone else to click the right sequence of buttons while they toke, smoke, scratch, fap, or whatever else they're doing while they make the parts.<br />
<br />
These are old world patterns after all, and the steps leading to the final product and the variety of materials to assemble each individual piece takes a while. The time to craft one of these Pets alone is greater than the time it takes to make a Chopper.</div></div><hr />

So lets see. <br />
<br />
Problem: Most guilds are using warrior tanks.<br />
<br />
Solution: Reduce paladin stamina by 3%. Increase DK stamina by 2%. Increase warrior stamina by 3%.<br />
<br />
I'm happy for my warrior toon but I can't for the life of me see any reason why warrior tanks need a buff right now. They are far and away the most used tank for endgame raids. Just strikes me as kinda odd that they would be getting buffed.</div></div><hr />

Oh definately not, we're still much sexier than our blue-eyed counterparts, however I do find the fact that blizzard seems un-willing to keep us in line with warriors (be it on top or bottom) rather annoying. After all, I raid with a warrior tank 90% of the time, I certainly don't want them to be weak. I just wish blizzard could keep the two classes balanced in terms of tanking.</div></div><hr />

dks need disease protection in every tree by tying such a great change to a 21 pt talent you have to give up a 51 pt talent or spec UH wich is already the best one .<br />
<br />
the y should have put it somewhere where every spec could have use it .<br />
<br />
<br />
As you already read from the other posts, Unholy spec is for diseases and shadow damage.<br />
Blood spec is for weapon damage and self healing.<br />
Frost spec is for dual wielding and frost damage.<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm really glad at warrior changes, 3% stamina is a pretty good change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
if we take a plate tank with 4K stamina after buffs, but before talents and without gunslot and 5K base HP (45K HP) and calculate for each tank:<br />
<br />
warrior: add 70 STAM from the gun (4070 stam) and add 9%, we get 4,436 STAM, or 49,360 HP.<br />
<br />
paladin: add 4% STAM, and 6% STAM: 4,409 STAM, or 49,090 HP.<br />
<br />
death knight: add 3% from VotTW (all tanks are blood) and 8% from frost presence: 4449 STAM or 49,490 HP.<br />
<br />
edit: this means that tank HP is balanced yet again. DK's still have the most, but warriors should no longer feel neglected.<br />

<br />
Get over yourselves, we may be the most used class, but thats because they were tanks back in vanilla and been with the guild for a long time. The guilds we are in have to work around our deficiencies to make the raid work, because we are friends. They rather us be other tanking classes, but we aren't. I sit out for paladins on certain fights because they do it better, and on other fights its &quot;ok&quot; for me to tank because the risk of me dying is lower and most likely we will still win. I am better geared, and more experienced then the other tanks in my guild, but my class is not as good as the others. <br />
<br />
After getting the nerfs to our mobility and our SS damage, its about time we got at least one good buff. Even in my current gear though, its only a 930 hp increase, but at least its a buff as compared to the many nerfs we have had since the start of wotlk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
How? It brought my single target threat up to 11k tps when I'm actually trying. It seems to be in line with other things.<br />
<br />
Think about it. We're less capable as aoe tanks. It's just harder to do, even if it is possible to keep up fairly well with paladins, I don't think Blizzard makes changes based on the high end of the community. It seems more ideal to buff based on the common player.<br />
<br />
And while the logic doesn't make sense because warriors are already awesome single target tanks, at least what we lack in terms of aoe threat and other tanking abilities, we'll make up for in burst threat. Awesome for dps races. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't mind seeing our threat single target nerfed. It's grossly unfair, and (in pugs) I'm pulling off the other tank (Toravon for example) with minimal effort. I can't even heroic strike when it's time for them to taunt. I take my hands off the keyboard to let them get threat.. And it still wouldn't be challenging for me to pull threat while I'm taking damage. Taking damage in any situation will quickly lead to an infinite rage scenario. Our threat is defenitely overpowered, I don't like not having to try. I was pulling threat off the druid I was tanking with in a Naxx undying run with a single shield slam.<br />
<br />
Nerf our single target threat.<br />
<br />
Reduce Thunder Clap and Shockwave cooldowns, buff Thunder Clap threat, decrease the damage caused by Shockwave for pvp balance. Buff Thunder Clap threat a lot. <br />
<br />
Our t10 shouldn't affect shield slam. It should be affecting our aoe threat and our dodge amounts in Icecrown. The prot t10 is grossly overpowered in a pvp situation. I'm not stacking block, at all. Given that, I have the 2 pc set bonus, and while tanking (in bt, but still an example) single target on Illidari Council, I pulled 4.3k dps. With glyph and shield block up, my shield slam was critting for 14k. My shockwaves are critting for 6-7k, making them invaluable to my single target rotation as well. Since 3.3, Concussion Blow and Shockwave became a lot more important to my single target rotation.<br />
<br />
I don't want to have to use this many abilities. I'm using a lot. It gets chaotic.<br />
<br />
I could give a shit less if I'm pulling 500 dps. If I'm pulling enough threat, it's working fine. They're not buffing in the correct direction though. Rage is a broken mechanic. I either have an infinite amount or I have none. If I'm not taking damage, I can't pull off anything. If I'm taking damage, I never have to conserve. It seems like if I'm more than half a second late on a Thunder Clap during an aoe pull, I lose threat. <br />
<br />
Warbringer nerf should only have affected player snares. Not mob and boss snares. It has given me problems more than you would think. And where I'm usually trying to run around and get everything hit, silenced and gathered for shockwaves and cleaving, a stun usually results in something dying.<br />
<br />
If it's at the beginning of the pull, that's the healer. And I don't think inevitable wipes are a game mechanic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why nerf concussion blow's damage? it's got a decent cooldown. A nerf was justifiable, but it feels like the damage was nerfed much more than neccesary. I would completely agree if it was on a 45(?) second cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Basically:<br />
Fix rage.<br />
Reduce Thunder Clap and Shockwave cooldowns.<br />
Nerf our t10 2pc.<br />
Nerf shockwave damage for pvp balance given a reduced cooldown.<br />
Buff all aoe threat abilities tps.<br />
Make demo shout useful again.<br />
There was too much of a bonus from concussion blow and shield slam threat buff. I don't think that having that much of an advantage is fun. Maybe I'm insane.<br />
Make warbringer remove snares from enemies and not players.<br />
Concussion Blow needs more damage or a shorter cooldown.<br />
Remove the range limitations from our shouts. When you have a warrior tank holding the boss, his buff isn't really going to reach the paladin tanking adds at the other side of the room.<br />
Thunder Clap needs a pretty large threat buff.<br />
That revenge buff is kind of retarded. Maybe i'm mistaken, but was it a tps or dps increase? I think it's dps... And revenge is an awesome pvp ability. Stack dodge. You have a stun with almost no cooldown, buffing the dps of it will once again make me awesome.<br />
<br />
<br />
There's a common misconception that warriors are in a great spot for balance in the game. I happen to think Blizzard is buffing the wrong places, and the spec needs a lot of work.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: changed my mind, don't like revenge buff.</div></div><hr />

Or less likely to run oom on Saurfang? Starfall change is very minor and won't address pve scaling issues with the haste and crit soft caps, but I guess a dps buff is a dps buff.

Warrior is not supposed to be a simple class to play. There is DK, or Paladin, or Druid tanks to play if you want simple, fixed AoE rotations and simple, fixed, single target rotations. WoW does not need another simple tanking class. It has three already. <br />
<br />
If ICC was not full of undead mobs then warriors would have no trouble competing with paladins on AoE threat there. Holy Wrath gives them huge burst threat off the pull, which then gets them proccing holy shield giving more threat. In fact, I would even say the shockwave stun works against warriors here, you spend the four seconds after your opening burst with no rage and no reflective shield damage to keep them hitting you. By the time that fades and you have spent four seconds autoattacking with no rage while the paladin / DK has had4 extra ticks of consecration or DnD plus 4 extra seconds to cast whatever abilities they want without rage issues they will have pulled aggro from you. <br />
<br />
Reflected damage in general is what makes AoE threat disparities seem a lot greater than they are. It turns a small threat advantage into a big one very quickly, when the mob is hitting you you not only cause more threat due to your reflected damage but you deny the other tank threat since he is getting no reflected damage. If they did nothing more than take the stun off of shockwave then warriors would find themselves a lot more competitive. Of course, it would kill shockwave as a defensive cooldown (and on trash pulls it is a fantastic defensive cooldown).<br />
<br />
There are also other things that you are probably not aware of. Watch how many times the paladin tank uses righteous defense to taunt 3 mobs off of you. A lot of tanks will spam taunt off of the other tank in the group.</div></div><hr />

+5% healing? If you take divinity, you're doing it wrong. All divinity does it contribute to overhealing. Grats on 5 wasted points.</div></div><hr />

Since recent Lay on Hands nerf. Guess how many cooldowns we can use?<br />
One, yes, that's ONE COOLDOWN.<br />
It's _either_ Lay on Hands _OR_ Divine Protection.<br />
<br />
They blame the recent stamina buff on Argent Defender, which is only a proof of healers not doing their job right.<br />
Ask ANY Protection Paladin and they'll swap Argent Defender for Last Stand or Shield Wall ANY day.<br />
<br />
<br />
As a would be tank I'm not so sure about that. Ardent Defender is pretty damn useful where Last Stand/Survival Instincts are both pretty crap. All three would suck if they did something like, say...apply Forbearance/a forbearance-like Debuff that prevented you from using any other defensive cooldown. Which then goes onto the other slight nitpickery...<br />
<br />
SHIELD WALL &gt; Divine Protection! Both skills are exceptionally similar and WOULD make things moot if it wasn't for the fact that Shield Wall doesn't apply a debuff that make a tank, the role made to take damage, more vulnerable to the elements then anything else for the next two minutes. Of course, the point is still rather moot since Shield Wall's is on a 5 minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
Conclusion: Complaining about cooldowns gets you nowhere unless said cooldowns are actually shit. Then it'd helps to try and reach a reasonable middle point since you're both doing the same job.<br />
<br />
Addendum: Paladin tanks do not take Divinity (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=63650).<br />

There is DK, or Paladin, or Druid tanks to play if you want simple, fixed AoE rotations and simple, fixed, single target rotations. WoW does not need another simple tanking class. It has three already. <br />
<br />
If ICC was not full of undead mobs then warriors would have no trouble competing with paladins on AoE threat there. Holy Wrath gives them huge burst threat off the pull, which then gets them proccing holy shield giving more threat. In fact, I would even say the shockwave stun works against warriors here, you spend the four seconds after your opening burst with no rage and no reflective shield damage to keep them hitting you. By the time that fades and you have spent four seconds autoattacking with no rage while the paladin / DK has had4 extra ticks of consecration or DnD plus 4 extra seconds to cast whatever abilities they want without rage issues they will have pulled aggro from you. <br />
<br />
Reflected damage in general is what makes AoE threat disparities seem a lot greater than they are. It turns a small threat advantage into a big one very quickly, when the mob is hitting you you not only cause more threat due to your reflected damage but you deny the other tank threat since he is getting no reflected damage. If they did nothing more than take the stun off of shockwave then warriors would find themselves a lot more competitive. Of course, it would kill shockwave as a defensive cooldown (and on trash pulls it is a fantastic defensive cooldown).<br />
<br />
There are also other things that you are probably not aware of. Watch how many times the paladin tank uses righteous defense to taunt 3 mobs off of you. A lot of tanks will spam taunt off of the other tank in the group. <br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, don't get me wrong.<br />
<br />
I don't want the class to be overly simplified. It just feels like my rotation is becoming way too long and that I'll be losing effectiveness. I enjoy having to think. I thought I was pretty clear on that. I like having to think ahead into a fight as to when I'm going to use an ability. It's nice to have to plan the fight out.<br />
<br />
<br />
But it does feel like there's a very small margin for error. If I mess up my rotation, it shouldn't affect everything. If my cleave is missing a target, I don't feel like it should automatically get pulled off of me. I should have more time to get to it while I'm tab targeting.<br />
<br />
Also, I forgot to add it but I think taunt mechanics in general should be changed. Glyph of taunt is practically mandatory... Taunts just shouldn't miss, or should be subjective to melee hit cap and not the spell hit cap. There's like a 17% chance for it to miss, isn't there?<br />
<br />
<br />
Once again, I don't think it's an intended part of design to really have much of anything mandatory in the game in that sort. It's like this whole Blizzard idea of freedom in talent builds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
warrior: add 70 STAM from the gun (4070 stam) and add 9%, we get 4,436 STAM, or 49,360 HP.<br />
paladin: add 4% STAM, and 6% STAM: 4,409 STAM, or 49,090 HP.<br />
death knight: add 3% from VotTW (all tanks are blood) and 8% from frost presence: 4449 STAM or 49,490 HP.<br />
<br />
Will doublecheck this later, don't have rawr at work.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, it's 101 STAM from the gun slot (Dreamhunter's Carbine (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=51834) is 65 STAM + 30 STAM gem + 6 STAM bonus). And more guns with better stats will be introduced in future. <br />
Anyhow, additional 400-500 HP don't seem to make much difference, at least for now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2010-02-25, 01:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">People complaining about the warrior buff:<br />
<br />
Get over yourselves, we may be the most used class, but thats because they were tanks back in vanilla and been with the guild for a long time. The guilds we are in have to work around our deficiencies to make the raid work, because we are friends. They rather us be other tanking classes, but we aren't. I sit out for paladins on certain fights because they do it better, and on other fights its &quot;ok&quot; for me to tank because the risk of me dying is lower and most likely we will still win. I am better geared, and more experienced then the other tanks in my guild, but my class is not as good as the others. <br />
<br />
After getting the nerfs to our mobility and our SS damage, its about time we got at least one good buff. Even in my current gear though, its only a 930 hp increase, but at least its a buff as compared to the many nerfs we have had since the start of wotlk.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly what warrior deficiencies are you talking about? My DK is my main and I have tanked pretty much every encounter in WotLK on her and on my warrior alt. I am main spec DPS but if, in the morning, our guilds MT (a warrior) decided to hang up his shoes and I was asked to take over as a full time tank I wouldn't hesitate in retiring my DK and going full time tank on my warrior. There is literally no comparison between the two.<br />
<br />
No other tank can chain physical cooldowns for 42 seconds in a row. No other tank has both health buff, AoE melee slow, AoE melee AP reduction and spell interrupts all rolled into one. Blizz have shown (Algalon and Anub) that they are very comfortable making instance end bosses that hugely favour block tanks. <br />
<br />
Shield wall at 60% damage reduction is the best damage reduction in the game. Last Stand at 30% increased health is second only to druids. Shield Block on most bosses is 30-50% damage reduction for 10 seconds on a one minute cooldown. If you really want survivability you can spec to, simultaneously, have both the biggest static health buff in the game and the biggest melee AP reduction in the game. <br />
<br />
The downsides? If you suck at using your cooldowns correctly you will die a lot. AoE threat is a bit trickier than it is for most classes. Warrior is in a fantastic place right now as a tank and has been all through every expansion the game has had. The only blip was versus DKs in early WotLK and you saw how quick Blizzard were to nerf them into oblivion (something they are only slowly being brought back from).<br />
<br />
The main reason that every guild should have a warrior MT though is that blizz are comfortable with a status quo where most guilds use warriors. The metric they use to judge tank balance is &quot;If most people are using warriors, tanking is fine&quot;. Anything that upsets that balance and sees any other tanking class coming to the fore is going to be very quickly dealt with. Warrior is the only complicated tanking class left. The others are much much simpler both in playstyle and in tools available. The fantastic thing about this from a warrior perspective is that if it means that Blizz can balance around a &quot;perfectly&quot; played DK, or Paladin or Druid since playing those classes at 100% tanking efficiency is reasonably achievable for most players. Warrior on the other hand has so many tools and tricks available that it has to be balanced around a less than perfect player. The balance point needs to be around a warrior who gets 80% or 90% right otherwise the vast majority of warriors simply can't compete with the much easier to master other tanking classes. The upside of this is that if you really know how to play as a warrior there is still plenty room to improve once you reach that point. The class has the highest skill cap.<br />
<br />
It is the one tanking class where if you fail it is because of you, not because of your class. This is very hard for some people to accept and want the warrior dumbed down to the same easymode style of play that paladins have, where perfect play involves two buttons for threat and one cooldown to watch. The good warriors don't care about that. They know that it is harder to get everything right as a warrior but they also know they don't have to. If you are getting most things right you will do just as well as that paladin. If you get nearly everything right you will do a lot better. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, don't get me wrong.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Like I said above, don't worry about the margin for error, warrior is balanced around imperfect play. That is what makes the class so powerful. The other three tanks are balanced around perfect play because, for all three, it is reasonably achievable. Since perfect play is pretty much impossible for warriors they have to be balanced around less than perfect play, which means that the closer you get to that the further you can pull ahead of the others.<br />
<br />
And yeah, taunt misses is a pain in the ass (especially when pretty much every boss in 25 man is basically made multi tank with the &quot;taunt right now or wipe&quot; mechanic). It's something like 7% hit chance from gear + glyph + 3% increased spell hit buff to never miss a taunt. On the other hand you nearly always have a 10 second window so you get 2 taunts before its a wipe. Even if that fails theres still mocking blow, or AoE taunt to buy you time for another, plus warrior has it pretty easy to burst out some threat right after a taunt so you will very rarely get aggrod back.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to use vigilance on my offtank for these fights. It doesn't feel like I have a choice, even though I'm relatively close to hit cap (256 from gear alone). I've had second tanks die recently because of taunt misses.<br />
<br />
I don't really agree with you on the fact that Blizzard favors Warriors. It's against anything of a stand point Blizzard has shown since Wrath was announced to have classes favored. And, we'd probably be op if we were favored.<br />
<br />
It doesn't feel like skill is a factor when I'm trying to pick up more mobs than I have cooldowns to gather together, or when I enter a heroic, and stay rage starved to the point where I can't attack everything immediately if Bloodrage was on cooldown at the beginning of the pull.<br />
<br />
Thank God for Warbringer, I use it to pull as many mobs as possible to get myself rage.<br />
<br />
But then I'm an infinite rage scenario which doesn't really feel fair.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors are either the best for the situation, or the worst. The same goes for druids. Rage is a horrid mechanic.</div></div><hr />

I wonder if there are some, in some form, already. Either way, I was so upset at the one time I had to abandon. I felt really uncomfortable about it and was upset that I had done it. I was just about to enter a dungeon and got ganked. I didn't leave queue, cause I thought I'd make it back to my body in time, before the dungeon was up. And, I did, but I got ganked again. Paladin OPness for the win. And, the dungeon popped. I was having trouble getting back to my body, as it was fairly far away and in a cave. And, I felt badly, making the group wait for me. So, I just told them that I had been ganked and apologized, then left the dungeon. :( <br />
<br />
I don't even know what dungeon it was, since I couldn't enter yet, being that I was dead. So, I didn't abandon due to dislike for the specific dungeon or anything at all like that, whatsoever. I just didn't want to hold everyone up, while I did a corpse run. D: Now, I wish I had just left the darn queue. I hope that those sort of things are taken into account, with these stat trackers. I hope that they give a small cushion of times to abandon. Assuming that things do happen. Like, you enter and you're at Uni, but a firedrill goes off. Or, you spill something all over your keyboard and desk. Or, you get a knock at the door and it's important. Etc? <br />

I've only abandoned that one time, ever. But, I still feel uncomfortable about it. :( <br />

)Diseases has been changed to Physical debuffs, and each one of them cause a damage like what Curse of Doom does every 2 seconds.<br />

Paladins:<br />

)Bubble now lasts 5minutes, up from 12 seconds, and the melee attack penalty has been removed.<br />
)Added an interrupt for the Loladins, called Faceroll freeze: Has a 2 Seconds CD and Silences the target for 1 Minute<br />

what is this shit? I mean, there's almost no mage that raides with fire....and moreover I've never heard the reason for this is &quot;fire draws aggro&quot;. but yeah, combustion cd reduce will fix it all ....</div></div><hr />

Anyways from the 5 or so pages i read, i cant believe nobody had brought up the natures grasp change for resto druids.

<br />
Ghostcrawler can start sucking every DK's dicks... most pityful blue ever, saying for months to DKs to L2P... and now what we get this change, I thought it wasn't needed...<br />
Btw last time I checked there is 24 DKs on SK-1000, impressive...<br />
<br />
<br />
About the hidden stats for dongeons, this is illarious to, I think it's just here to educate ppl... I remember one day I got DC 30sec (normally you can't kick a DC before 1min), at the second I got back in they kicked me... because the timer of 60sec was no more since I was back in the game, I was kicked like a normal player... and btw I'm a Tank... I also love the 30min deserter, coz I'm gonna use it, as a lot of fellow tanks I know too...the queues are gonna get longer and longer for everybody else, I love it! Coz this will make Blizzard realize how stupid this change is.... As a matter of fact, a player who has a high dongeon completition shouldn't have a deserter.... he should be immune, to kicks, I mean get over it the ppl who complete the most dongeons in a day are Tanks...and if they do complete a lot of them for every others 4 ppl linked to it, well they actually help the damn queue to empty...they should be kings, immune to kick, immune to deserter, it's their right to deserter a sicky dongeon with sicky ppl once in a while...<br />
<br />
Everytime there is a wipe, it's the Tank who takes the heat from the bad mouths and all, it's sick... there should be a &quot;no tank day revolution&quot;, people would learn to stfu, and play decently, and be gracious when the tank do the job... coz trust me tank is the most fucking boring role ever... the only good thing, is that you have a huge control over the pace of the dongeon, that's all... if everybody else around you suck, you take the blame...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2010-02-25, 05:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone who is saying a 60% shield wall is great might want to take a look at the glyph of shield wall.<br />
<br />
Reduces the cooldown on Shield Wall by 2 min, but Shield Wall now only reduces damage taken by 40%.<br />
<br />
The only way shield wall can get on the same field of Divine protection is by being glyphed which makes shield wall 3 minutes 40% and divine protection 2 minutes 50%. So now the paladin cooldown is better in every aspect. Warriors would need to talent to get 2 minutes 40%. So go ahead and give up a major glyph and two talent points and then you can bitch to us.<br />
<br />
To clarify a couple things before someone says them. No paladin tank will skip sacred duty so you can't count those 2 points the same way a warrior would have to spend 2 talent points.<br />
<br />
Secondly you can look at it this way<br />
<br />
50% every 2 minutes is better than 60% every 4(5) minutes 99% of the time<br />
50% every 2 minutes is better than 40% every 2(3) minutes 100% of the time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now please make a list of fights that require you to use shield wall more than once. Oh wait, there aren't any ...<br />
<br />
The reality is that 60% reduced once every boss fight is better than 50% reduced once every boss fight. The majority of fights that require cooldown use have a high damage phase. This is often an enrage at the end e.g. Putricide, Saurfang, Anub these fights it is a burndown phase and nobody gets to use their cooldowns more than once.<br />
<br />
Then there are fights with high damage spikes, Twin Val'kyr during Twin's Pact, Festergut, but these are always balanced in such a way that they don't come up more than once or twice per fight (and a warrior has two very good cooldowns). Nearly all are also physical damage, shield block is a fantastic cooldown against physical damage. With a pretty sparse 2000 block a warrior using shield block will block 4000 damage at least on every attack for 10 seconds and 8000 on 60% of those attacks, or an average of 6400 damage per attack. Even against a ridiculously hard hitting boss like, say a 3 inhale festergut that is hitting for 35k that is an 18% damage reduction. Against a more reasonable enrage where the boss is hitting for 20k it is a 32% damage reduction and only with a 1 minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
The biggest success for warriors has been in successfully perpetuating the myth that shield block is not worth mentioning as a cooldown. Why do so many bosses have unblockable specials? Easy, because shield block would trivialise those encounters if they specials could be blocked. <br />
<br />
Look, for example at a simple fight like Marrowgar. On 10 man marrowgar hits for about 10k to a tank just starting out there (in 232-245) level gear. Shield block when used on that fight is about 60-70% reduced damage ... for 10 seconds ... on a 1 minute cooldown ... with a very low 2000 block. At 2500 block shield block would be 80% mitigation against marrowgar. This is ridiculously good. Yet warriors will look at an ability like Anti-magic Shell, which is useful on, hmm, not a single fight in ToC or ICC and yell about it being overpowered.<br />
<br />
If your warrior is dying more often than your paladin, or your DK, or your druid on pretty much any fight in the game it is because he is not using his cooldowns, plain and simple. If he claims he is there is an easy solution. Make him macro a raid warning into his Last Stand, his Shield Wall and his Shield Block. It's easy, you just make a macro that says:<br />
<br />
#showtooltip Last Stand<br />
/rw LAST STAND USED<br />
/cast Last Stand<br />
<br />
At this point one of two things will happen. Either he will continue to die like a noob with nobody seeing any raid warnings or he will actually use his abilities correctly now he knows he is being watched and his death count will go way way down. The one big advantage clueless paladins have over clueless warriors is that ardent defender kicks in automatically to save their ass. A crappy paladin will be much more survivable than a crappy warrior. That does not make warriors as a class crappy, it just makes the class less forgiving of ineptitude.</div></div><hr />

Cooldowns aren't only used for high tank damage phases. They can be used for when raid damage increases and relieving work on the healers helps. Lets use festergut as an example. Say a paladin is tanking first. He could divine protection at 2 inhales and make life easier. By the time his turn comes up to tank a 3 inhale he will have it back. As for raid warning you seem to ignore the fact things happen in real time. When I am deciding to use a cooldown to save myself a healer is also deciding to use a cooldown to save me. We will both use these cooldowns at relatively the same time and that's it, the damage is done and they are both gone. As for why shield block isn't metioned you covered it yourself. For any situation where you need to use a cooldown shield block is not an acceptable cooldown.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Every two minutes a paladin can use talented divine protection.<br />
Every two minutes a warrior can use talented + glyphed shield wall, and glyphed last stand, and shield block twice.<br />
<br />
I fail to see how the paladin has any advantage here.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, in a situation where you only use your cooldowns once, like for example, if you were doing the intelligent thing and letting your healers heal you through two stacks and not glyphing and talenting your shield wall and last stand then we have the other situation. You both get healed fine through two stacks but when it comes your turn to tank three stacks the paladin has 50% damage reduced for 12 of the 30 seconds and is relying on ardent defender to carry him through the other 18 while the warrior has 60% damage reduced for 12 seconds, 30% increased health for the remaining 20 seconds and a further ~20% damage reduced for 10 of those seconds from shield block being up at the same time.<br />
<br />
If a warrior wants to turn his cooldowns into lesser cooldowns he can spam more often he has that choice. If the paladin on the other hand would like to turn his spammy cooldown into a better cooldown he could use less often then he can't do that. The warrior has flexibility. The paladin doesn't.<br />
<br />
And where do you get me saying shield block isn't a suitable cooldown? The fights in ICC all have blockable damage spikes. Even against attacks that can't be blocked (Gormak for example) shield block provides fantastic mitigation against any other hits that come at the same time. Don't put words in my mouth please.</div></div><hr />

I am saying big damage hits are not something you use shield block on because its either unblockable or it magic. You say he is relying on ardent defender like its a bad thing. Now he gets through the 3rd inhale without it procing and someone slips up healing after because its back to raid healing, shit, ardent defender procs and he doesnt die and your other tanks do. The fact is 2 talent points is a huge cost to reduce the cooldown by a minute to get it to a level where you can use it more than once. Glyphing it without a doubt makes it a worse ability but again is one of the only ways to bring it down to a level where you can use the ability more than once. I know algalon isn't current tier but he was a good example of this. He did a big hit every 1.5 minutes which means each tank had to deal with it twice. A paladin can deal with both by himself. A warrior can deal with 1 by himself if he isn't glyphed or none if he is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I could see it being a nice change if they made it 1 charge in 2v2, 2 charges in 3v3 and 3 charges in 5v5 or bgs. Or just make it snare the person who triggered it and anyone within 5 or 10 yards of them. The really funny thing is though, whatever they do with it will still be made an absolute joke of by blessing of freedom. Why would anyone care how often it gets applied when you are snare immune. <br />
<br />
As written though it is a huge buff in 2v2 where druids are already quite strong, and not as much as a buff in 3v3 and 5v5 where druids are a lot weaker. <br />
<br />
In fact, the real change they should make is to limit the total number of snares blessing of freedom can prevent. That is a change that wouldn't hit paladins all that hard in 2v2 where they are reasonably represented but would pull them back a notch in 3v3 and 5v5 where they are very much overrepresented. <br />
<br />
If they made Blessing of Freedom remove or prevent at most 3 snares that would be a much more interesting change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What big hits in ICC are unblockable? Lady Deathwhispers frostbolt is the only one I can think of offhand, but then a warrior can interrupt that ...<br />
<br />
And lets be honest here, at 3 stacks Festergut is hitting for 35k+. That means Ardent Defender is going to proc on the very first hit unless the paladin has 54k health. From that point on if he takes 2 hits in a row the paladin will die. Most people drastically overestimate how good Ardent Defender is. I went through my own guilds Festergut logs from the tries when we used a paladin tank. Ardent Defender procced once in all the logs I could find and he died from the next hit one second later.<br />
<br />
When AD procs it heals by up to 30% of the paladins health. The heal our pala got was 8.5k out of a health pool of, presumably 50k+ raid buffed at the time. Compared to 20 seconds of 15k+ extra health that a warrior would have in the same situation it doesn't even come close.

<br />
<br />
Argent defender, and the option to either LoH (in the rare rare case that there's no healer available and you're -definitely- going to die with the next hit), or to remove all debuffs with a cancel aura macro.. Oh don't forget you can divine sacrafice and cancel aura macro to make it cancel the sacrafice part and get a two minute 20% shield wall.. Also Argent Defender Scales. <br />
<br />
<br />
Now please make a list of fights that require you to use shield wall more than once. Oh wait, there aren't any ...<br />
<br />
You're confused me thinks.. <br />
<br />
<br />
Nearly all are also physical damage, shield block is a fantastic cooldown against physical damage. <br />
<br />
Actually being able to block with a modest chance and effect for most of the fight rather then 10 seconds every minute is even better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Easy, because shield block would trivialise those encounters if they specials could be blocked. <br />
<br />
And the fact that paladins could hit the point where they push normal hits off the table has nothing to do with it... /sarcasm<br />
<br />
<br />
60-70% reduced damage<br />
<br />
10k to a tank starting out... 60% is 6k.. Shield block doubles their BV..It will take 3k block value before shield block to mitigate that much.. If a warrior tank is running that much BV when starting ICC in progression then they're probably gearing for it.. And therefore bad.. + 3k SBV is past the SS DR point which just makes it pointless to stack altogether.. <br />
But pulling math out of your ass is fun..<br />
<br />
<br />
At 2500 block shield block would be 80% mitigation against marrowgar.<br />
<br />
Ummm.. 5k blocked off every hit..Is 50%...Not 80%... Which doesn't account for the single tick of cold flames tanks will take every time marrowgar spawns it under them so.. It's less then 50% altogether.. Oh and dodging / parrying more during that 10 seconds (during a 10 second time frame the chance that you dodge / parry / get missed can be 100%, in a 20 minute combat sample it's more likely to get normalized to your % chance to avoid but in short time frames it's more likely that 5-10 melee hits will be dodged then 100 melee hits will all be dodged..).. So in reality your number is miserably off.. Not to mention the paladins semi-static 30% increased chance to block which will may be up through the entire fight...<br />
<br />
<br />
It's easy, you just make a macro<br />
<br />
If a priest waits to see this macro then they're bad. They should hit it as soon as I need it..Which is the moment I should hit it as well.. So if we should both be hitting it at the same time.. How will the macro help? But yes I commonly do run this macro anyway, despite the fact that it doesn't become better then defender by any lengths. <br />
<br />
<br />
Every two minutes a paladin can use talented divine protection, Divine sac but cancel aura the sacrafice part, have argent defender go off when they need it (because why would a warrior use last stand if they didn't need it) and Holy Shield 7 times.<br />
Every two minutes a warrior can use talented + glyphed shield wall, and glyphed last stand, and shield block twice.<br />
<br />
I fixed that for you.. Also yes talents &gt; talents and 2/3 glyph spots..</div></div><hr />

Lady Deathwhispers frostbolt is the only one I can think of offhand, but then a warrior can interrupt that ...<br />
<br />
And lets be honest here, at 3 stacks Festergut is hitting for 35k+. That means Ardent Defender is going to proc on the very first hit unless the paladin has 54k health. From that point on if he takes 2 hits in a row the paladin will die. Most people drastically overestimate how good Ardent Defender is. I went through my own guilds Festergut logs from the tries when we used a paladin tank. Ardent Defender procced once in all the logs I could find and he died from the next hit one second later.<br />
<br />
When AD procs it heals by up to 30% of the paladins health. The heal our pala got was 8.5k out of a health pool of, presumably 50k+ raid buffed at the time. Compared to 20 seconds of 15k+ extra health that a warrior would have in the same situation it doesn't even come close. It is easy to concoct imaginary scenarios where AD saves the day but the reality is that for the most part, it doesn't. <br />

LoH is not a tank cooldown. In fact, if it's used on yourself, it NEGATES our tanking cooldown by giving you forearance. So, you'd have to use it when you already don't have forbearance, an don't plan on taking more dangerous dmg afterwards.... which is never in any realistic raid situation. Good try, but fail.<br />

You really have no clue how good shield block is, do you? <br />
<br />
Quick quiz. If a warrior and a paladin, both wearing a measly 2000 bv (mostly gained from strength on good tanking gear) tank a boss for 10 minutes with the paladin using holy shield on cooldown, and the warrior using shield block on cooldown, WHO BLOCKS THE MOST DMG?<br />
<br />
&quot;pulling math out of your ass&quot; is something you like to do as well, eh? Since you haven't done your research, I'll just answer this question for you. The warriors mitigates more damage through blocks. That's right, even though warriors don't block every attack, the combined synergy of shield block + critical block are BETTER than holy shield.<br />
<br />
Not the mention that in ICC, paladins don't block every attack anymore.<br />
<br />
Seriously, stop pulling math out of your ass.</div></div><hr />

The way the holiday thing is worded, it sounds like each player gets a personal holiday &quot;cache&quot; once per day off the boss which I guess avoids having to roll on whatever drops.<br />

Well, from what I can read, it's only a cache that can contain mounts and other rare items. But for example if you queue up for the same holiday boss more times each day, you can only get the (if we talk Love-festival here) epic necklaces.</div></div><hr />

Icy Talons: The personal haste benefit provided by this talent is no longer exclusive with other sources of melee haste.

A nerf was justifiable, but it feels like the damage was nerfed much more than neccesary. I would completely agree if it was on a 45(?) second cooldown.<br />
<br />
--------------------stuff-----------------------<br />
<br />
That revenge buff is kind of retarded. Maybe i'm mistaken, but was it a tps or dps increase? I think it's dps... And revenge is an awesome pvp ability. Stack dodge. You have a stun with almost no cooldown, buffing the dps of it will once again make me awesome.<br />
<br />
There's a common misconception that warriors are in a great spot for balance in the game. I happen to think Blizzard is buffing the wrong places, and the spec needs a lot of work.<br />
<br />
edit: changed my mind, don't like revenge buff.<br />
<br />
<br />
Concussion Blow's damage was nerfed because of butthurt frost mages in PvP who complained that prot warrior had too much damage for their level of control given that they couldn't be kited. So in typical blizzard fashion they not only nerfed our long CD burst...they tried to murder Warbringer at the same time.<br />
<br />
The only problem was that the nerf to Concussion Blow took a TPS button out of our rotation, and nerfed our DPS even harder when combined with the shield slam (once again...whiney frost mages) nerf at high gear levels. To compensate they took a look at what buttons we push for our filler (devastate) and hotfixed in a 20% buff.<br />
<br />
This had the (somehow) unforseen effect of removing revenge from our rotations on bosses because before, devastate and revenge were about even for DPS with a bit of a TPS advantage on revenge (hence revenge was above devastate in our TPS rotations). By adding 20% to devastate, not only does it end up doing more damage per GCD than revenge, it now does as much if not more threat. This makes revenge useless in its entirety.<br />
<br />
So they're going to add 50% to revenge across the board. In total, this should make it hit harder than concussion blow ever did. More than devastate does currently, and put it on par with shield slam (I hope) except it scales with your weapon rather than your shield.<br />
<br />
All in all, it's actually a pretty sexy buff. They basically turned it into a second shield slam DPS-wise.<br />
<br />
I don't see the 50% buff staying untouched. All they're doing is replacing one problem (shield slam crits) with another (revenge crits). I just hope the CD on revenge and it's opponent dependent nature even things out.<br />
<br />
Of course, a lot of Arena quarterbacks don't seem to understand the concept behind &quot;don't attack the dude with the shield and his DPS goes through the damn floor&quot;.<br />
Sounds kinda similar to &quot;don't stand in the fire&quot; and we already know how much trouble people have with that concept.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
10k to a tank starting out... 60% is 6k.. Shield block doubles their BV..It will take 3k block value before shield block to mitigate that much..

So in reality your number is miserably off.. Not to mention the paladins semi-static 30% increased chance to block which will may be up through the entire fight...<br />
<br />
<br />
You might want to look up critical block in the warrior tank tree. 60% chance to block double the amount. I never even mentioned dodge or parry? What are you on about? You are responding to things you imagined I said.<br />
<br />
Also cold flame ticks? You do know they can be 100% mitigated just by the simple expedient of moving your ass right? <br />
<br />
Again, it comes down to the typical warrior line, they take everything they have and try to conjure up a worst case scenarion where it isn't great and compare it to other class abilities in a stereotypical ideal scenario where they work perfectly. How many bosses in ICC hit for 35k? One ... for 30 seconds out of the entire fight, during which you are chaining cooldowns anyway. Yet if you ever see shield block mentioned by a warrior it is almost guranteed to be in a sentence something like &quot;Shield block lol, like blocking 2k helps when you are getting hit for 35k&quot;. They ignore the fact that in 95% of the boss fights you are rarely getting hit for over 20k, where even 2k is pretty decent mitigation, the 4k from a critical block is 20% mitigation, and the guranteed 4k minimum from using shield block is a very respectable 20% reduction for a very short cooldown ability, and thats even if your 60% chance to critically block never kicks in.<br />
<br />
You can't compare one classes worst case scenario with another classes best case scenario. It is being highly disingenuous to do so. You can't claim your 60% damage reduction is useless but a 50% damage reduction is overpowered. You can't claim that a chance to heal yourself for 30% is overpowered but a constant 30% increased health for 20 seconds is useless.<br />
<br />

How will the macro help? But yes I commonly do run this macro anyway, despite the fact that it doesn't become better then defender by any lengths. <br />
<br />
<br />
The macro will show the raid when the warrior dies because he screwed up. It is not to tell the priests anything. It is so the raid leader can see that the warrior is dying not because he has a gimped class but because he is failing to use his cooldowns correctly. Bad warriors die because they didn't use their cooldowns when they should have and then blame the class. If you had actually read my post you would see that is the point I was making.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I fixed that for you.. Also yes talents &gt; talents and 2/3 glyph spots.. <br />
<br />
<br />
Options &gt; No Options. Finding 2 talent points in the prot tree is easy, Imp Revenge, Gag Order and Shield Spec all being places where a raiding warrior can very easily take 2 talents to get Improved Specialisations. <br />
<br />
Being able to reconfigure your cooldowns from glyphs is far superior to having to respec. Your guilds inscriptors will make them for you at cost price, 1 or 2g each. I get them made a stack of 20 at a time. I can change my glyphs as needed, on every single boss in an instance for less than the cost of a single respec. <br />
<br />
Which of course is mostly irrelevent anyway because there simply aren't any bosses where the shorter cooldowns convey an advantage in ICC. The longer cooldown but bigger magnitude cooldowns are simply superior on pretty much all the encounters.</div></div><hr />

I honestly dont care. Engineering needs help. I replied to the other person because he was being a stingy jackass saying he'd only work for people of the same profession. And to that, i wonder how many enchants, gems, glyphs, blacksmithing belt or flasks he uses? And he is being a stingy bastard when it comes to lending out his profession to help others?

So lets see. <br />
<br />
Problem: Most guilds are using warrior tanks.<br />
<br />
Solution: Reduce paladin stamina by 3%. Increase DK stamina by 2%. Increase warrior stamina by 3%.<br />
<br />
I'm happy for my warrior toon but I can't for the life of me see any reason why warrior tanks need a buff right now. They are far and away the most used tank for endgame raids. Just strikes me as kinda odd that they would be getting buffed. <br />
<br />
It has been said zillion times.<br />
They are not buffing becouse of low representation, but becouse of disparity among tanks.<br />
Just becouse warrior is long term most used tank in most guilds have nothing to do with if he is or isnt in need of buffs/nerfs</div></div><hr />

<br />
thank you blizz for finally understanding the DK mechanism in pvp ,the only unfair part of this change (I'm not being ungrateful ,but as all DK players know all 3 DK trees have their damage big time dependable of diseases on target) is that is to deep in UH tree and the 2 other specs can reach it by sacrificing a lot from their main tree specc,anyway :<br />

You don't seem to understand that for an Unholy DK not having diseases on the target severely gimps your dps in pvp and was unfair since it is the main mechanic behind our dps. The DK diseases should have been physical effects in the first place like UB. I wonder if rogues will still be able to cloak out of them? :P</div></div><hr />

Could be for the retaking of Gnomeregan event...isn't there a quest where you have to drop bombs or such around the entrance? <br />
<br />
Yeah, the rocket mount could very well be &quot;Thunderflash&quot; - see below:<br />
<br />
Quest - Vent Horizon<br />
Objective - Use Pilot Muzzlesprock's flying machine to toss Radiageigatrons at the vents surrounding Gnomeregan.<br />
Description<br />
We thought that we could wait for the radiation to subside around Gnomeregan, but it doesn't appear to be getting better. If we want to take back our city, we need to make sure it's safe for our troops to enter. Take these Radiageigatrons, hop in 'Thunderflash' here, and toss them at the ventilation shafts outside of Gnomeregan. They'll report the radiation levels directly to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I reserve the right to QQ :)<br />
<br />
<br />
Because instead of stripping 3k HP away from you like they should've they stripped 1.5k away and gave 1.5k to Warriors and a little over 1k to DK. No, you don't have any right to QQ. Can't wait for them to strip Ardent Defender cheat death heal away from you too. Way more useful than Last Stand. It's not like paladin tanking is difficult anyway, You spam a 6 button rotaton. Other tanks actually have to pay attention to what's going on in combat and expend cooldowns accordingly. QQ is the reason Vitality was nerfed in the first place. IMO they should bring it back to 10% just like it was during BC. This change is just more proof they have no idea what they're doing and plan to undo whatever they feel didn't work out a few patches down the line. We're playing a paid beta. Get used to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unholy is the disease tree, its damage isnt just linked to diseases, it depends on them. Blood and Frost arent nearly as dependant. Plus there is also the fact that a disease buff in the disease tree just plain makes sense....and blizzard doesnt want every DK to have this ability baseline, they want you to sacrifice for it. Look what warriors have to do to get an MS, and be glad you at least have that much choice.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, Arms for MS or Fury for a lesser one...<br />
<br />
ops... two options... glad that blizz put a lesser option on a tree other than Unholy... oh wait...</div></div><hr />

This mount changes depending on your Riding skill and location.<br />
<br />
now obviously this means it's like the DK one, so if you have noob flying you get a 150% mount and if you have good flying it's 280%, but do you think it ALSO means if you have Super Pro flying, it can be 310%?<br />

now as to the location, do you think it'll be a Flying mount when you're in OL/NR, but a normal land mount in the Old world? so dependant on your location it changes. What would be superepicextremeawesome and would cause me to grind for this no matter WHAT IT TOOK, is if the model hadn't been released yet, because it actually WASN'T one model, but 2/3 etc, so when it changed based on your skill/location the model would change to, so it'd be a normal horse in the old world, but would then...

Currently, Life Tap scales with spirit, which means the more spirit you have, the more mana it provides, but also the more life it takes away. With patch 3.3.3, it will consider SP instead of spirit when calculating how much mana you are going to get (and also how much life you are going to lose). Check out wowhead's Life Tap, it has the formula on it: http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=57946<br />
<br />
This change will make Life Tap reward more mana, which is good, but it will also make it take more life away, which is bad (all of this assuming you have more SP than spirit, which you should have anyway, and also assuming the formula stays the same, just changing SPI for SP). If you are Affliction and have Improved Life Tap, that is probably a very good change for you. But even when that's not the case, I still think this is a good change. With the amounts of haste we are able to get nowadays, we cast more frequently and therefore lose mana faster. I'm finding myself OOM and having to Life Tap more frequently, even when the buff from the glyph is still up, although this depends a little on your spec and if you have mana efficiency talents. This change will probably prevent that. But we will have to be more careful, since Life Tap will take a larger chunk of our life away.<br />
<br />
This will probably also overhaul all the Dark Pact builds, since it will probably not be on par with Life Tap anymore in terms of mana efficiency.</div></div><hr />

What I didn't get is this. Is this the 20s ICD that was mentioned in an earlier blue post? Or does it mean that, after it is over, it can't be procced for 20s?</div></div><hr />

If they added something like this I'd expect it to cost big money to make and wouldn't be Engineering specific since they seem to be getting away from the Engineering specific pets and eventually mounts most likely. I'll enjoy being able to fly it in the quest that it's in for now, and if they add it in then awesome. Whatever they give us, whether it's primarily for us or not, I'll take it without complaining because they could just ignore it altogether and add nothing.<br />

They better nerf the fuck out of druid healing if they are putting 3 charges on that mofo.<br />
<br />
I'd rather put a cooldown to counteract it so that the healing in raiding doesn't suffer. Still, a boost to their survival ability is awesome if you play the class in pvp, yet if you don't you'll likely be complaining when they keep you stuck to the ground forever while they blast you from far away.</div></div><hr />

I got tons of money to buy crafted mounts, and for now I made exactly four bikes: for me, my wife and two of my friends, so— not the most profitable of professions ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
No offense to you guys about making the 2 person flying mount only engineering and I see that you guys hate that profession but I honestly believe Blizz would not make something as BIG as a 2 person flying mount only for a profession. Look at all the other professions, not ONE of them has something as big as a mount that only that profession can use. Blizz would not do something like that if you think about. Tell me one thing that any other profession can do that is huge and rare. All professions are for making money....that's it or items that can be helpful during raids, pvp, etc. or small things like a magic carpet or the engineering flying mount. I can't possibly believe that the ONLY two-person mount that will ever be in World of Warcraft could just go to engineering professions so either you guys suck it up and learn how to make money with engineering or switch :P All I really believe is that mount will cost BIG BUCKS $$$$$!!!!<br />
<br />
Even if it did go to engineering, which I highly doubt, it's going to cost a lotttttttttttttt of money. Look at the chopper, it's a lot of money and I'm pretty sure not all engineers even have it let alone other players with different professions.</div></div><hr />

From what I read is that it can only proc every 20 seconds. That is, once it procs, it starts a 20 second ICD that must run it's duration before proccing again. <br />
<br />
However, the one thing I find strange is with them buffing DP to 45 seconds in 3.3.3, this means we should be seeing DP up at all times (or very close to).<br />
<br />
That is, unless this change implies that after running the 45 second buff, there is a 20 second delay before it can proc again. <br />
<br />
Confuzzled. :-\</div></div><hr />

You even mention Flying Carpets. They are only craftable/usable by Tailors with 300+/425+ (regular/epic) skill. Or were you only talking about passenger mounts?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I, for one, won't be making them for any non-Engineers because they don't fucking deserve them.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, when engineers WHINE about how they can't make any money with the profession and then Blizzard gives them an amazing way to make money with the profession they can whine more?<br />
<br />
Have fun not making anyone without engineering any of the pets because other engineers will make them and make thousands of gold from selling them. They both have somewhat rare schematics, so this is going to be a gold mine for engineering.</div></div><hr />
