Mobs Level Scaling<br />
This is actually intended; we've done some work behind the scenes to make it so mobs don't instantly level and get harder when you ding. The idea being that when you ding from 104 to 105, you haven't had a chance to get 105 gear yet, so you're wearing 104 gear and now creatures have more health and do more damage.<br />
<br />
That's very wise. Addresses that concern quite well. how much does it lag behind though? If you gain 2 levels in a short period of time will mobs linger 2 levels behind or will the difference never exceed 1?<br />
I believe it's somewhere around 50% - and then it'll trigger when you complete a quest, hit a loading screen, or log out. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/410526-mobs-not-leveling-with-me/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743624869?page=1#4))<br />

Artifact Relics in PvP<br />
We are considering disabling relics in PvP instances (battlegrounds, skirmishes, arenas, and rated battlegrounds) due to way gear is handled in PvP in Legion. Item level will not have as much impact in PvP which throws off the balance of relic itemization.

Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Re WoW/RPGs, do you think race/class limits provide better lore than any conceivable combo and justifying lore to go w/ it?<br />
If I understand the question, I always felt held hostage to making races essentially cosmetic. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/723632698191810560))<br />
That includes concerns for power (racial bonuses), player agency (I want to be a gnome paladin), or lore. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/723632822854914048))<br />

It's not about the challenge but the counter-intuitive fact that dinging makes you weaker if the effect is not mitigated. If you don't want it, he told you how to turn it off.</div></div><hr />

Its not counter-intuitive if you level and your gear stays the same. That's how it's supposed to work. Some arbitrary time frame where 105 mobs fight like 104 mobs is pathetic hand holding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's based on percentages and not fixed numbers. so a level 100 and a level 108 will do different numbers but the Percent of health they remove will be equal, or roughly, obviously depending on balance of class, gear, but that's the gist. I actually prefer it this way much better than characters just scaling down to whatever zone, because when you scale down you are really OP, which kind of defeats the point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's more convenient to have mobs level with you, increasing experience gains and avoiding out leveling zones. The fact is, if you ding and start attacking mobs your same level in retail, it's the same thing. It's been that way from the beginning. Complaining about item level to mob power ratios is asinine. You could just suggest that you don't want mobs to level with you. That's actually what you're asking for. Or am I wrong; are you actually asking for mobs to get easier as you level? -_-</div></div><hr />

<br />
So the thing you attack will also do more damage ?<br />
So if some 101 level attacks something and a lvl 110 comes along, puts a low damage dot on it and drops aggro the 101 player gets raped by the add ?</div></div><hr />

So you mean no more help from higher level guildies? No more &quot;I play healer/clothie so I come back next level and do that harder group quest next level&quot;? Will then everyone play hunters and plate mele dps and visibly weaker solo classes will be avoided even more? I see this as big disadvantage. <br />
<br />
Some time ago I rolled paladin (gave up priest) healer because leveling with mele offspec was much easier (easy to solo group quests) than with priest. I hear Blizzard want to make us stuck with our main specs when we level and do dailies (not sure if that idea still holds after all feedback against it) so I started pondering if I should level by pure dungeons only. I dont want to go through doing quests on healer plus even worse with level scalling so you cant even do greenies. It was like that in BC and it sucked (yey wand spec). Ofcourse it is doable to level as healer and quest but it goes 10 times faster as tank or dps class. Anyone seen people doing solo old world raids in healer spec? Exactly...</div></div><hr />

You could just suggest that you don't want mobs to level with you. That's actually what you're asking for. Or am I wrong; are you actually asking for mobs to get easier as you level? -_-<br />
<br />
The whole point in having a level is to assign special improvements according to leveling progress (like, increasing number of skills and talent points etc.) and having a measure to the strength of your character relative to other characters and PVE mobs / bosses. That's why we have mobs with different levels which correspond to level requirement of a zone<br />
<br />
Mobs having flexible levels is nonsensical in this regard. They nullify the power comparison from player character to mob, but also nullify the power comparison from 2 player character with different levels in regard to that mob. It's OK for some scenarios (being able to quest as equal partners with different levels of characters) and not OK for others (asking one high level character for help because you cannot get a whole 5 man group together for whatever reasons). The approach has its uses - like not outleveling a zone if outleveling is seen as detrimental (can be a very subjective thing, though) - but it's not a godsend solution to all problems.<br />
<br />
I never understood the problem with outleveling a zone. I had either the goal of finishing a zone before I move on, because of storytelling, then I ignored the diminishing XP. Or I wanted to level ASAP, then I ignored finishing the zone (and possibly returned later to complete the quests).</div></div><hr />

So if some 101 level attacks something and a lvl 110 comes along, puts a low damage dot on it and drops aggro the 101 player gets raped by the add ?<br />
<br />
No. It always looks and feels L101 to you. His dot's effects will also look (to you) as if they were cast by a L101, because everything is a raw percentage scaled to your level's perspective.</div></div><hr />

That`s what disturbing me as well...It can be problematic, maybe not right at the start, but later...Hand`s down, as far I`ve seen, the questing is piss off easy, but still...If I`m lvl 105, my gf lvl 104 we can`t go together?

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">kaalta</div><div class="date">2016-05-03, 10:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically you will not feel your gear's strength in the new zones... I am 100% sure they are systematically destroying this game. <br />
<br />
We are forced to use these &quot;legendary&quot; (common) weapons... there is no alternative it is like garrison all over again.<br />
<br />
Level scaling system as I understand it:<br />
<br />
Say You are a level 100 in full greens, you have 500k HP, you go around and hit a mob for 10% of its health (Ignore the amount of health 10% represents for you). Then this mob hits you for 5% of your health (That's 25k HP).<br />
<br />
A level 110 in full greens with 1m HP (1 million or twice your health); He then hits the mob for 10% <br />
Then the mob hits him for 5% of his health (50k HP).<br />
<br />
Now suddenly a level 110 in FULL MYTHIC gear with 2m HP comes by and hits this same mob, and he takes 40% of the mobs HP.<br />
<br />
So a player 100 with level appropriate greens is as bad as a 110 with level appropriate in greens; A player 100 with level appropriate epics* is as good as a 110 with level appropriate epics.<br />
<br />
So TL;DR <br />
<br />
Everyone hits the mob for some % of its HP; The mob hits for a % of each individual HP. And while level does not improve your performance, (level appropriate) item quality does. <br />
<br />
*The level 100 with epics is only at his best while he remains at 100, once he hits 101 (and reaches 50% of XP according to the latest post) he is no longer using the best possible gear for his level.</div></div><hr />

I'm not 'asking' for anything, dimwit, I'm trying to explain what I think they're doing. <br />
<br />
And yes, right now if you level to 95 and go attack a 95 mob, it works that way. BUT if you level to 95 while questing among 94s or 93s, it does not.</div></div><hr />

Fuck off with the name calling. You're not explaining anything, you're just looking for an argument. Having mobs scale with you and *then* making them easier when you level is pathetic hand holding.

I didn't misrepresent what you said, you were defending higher level mobs actually getting easier when you ding. If you feel differently than that, then you should clarify what you actually want to say. Otherwise, just getting all salty because someone disagrees and you get nasty with them makes you look like a childish, selfish, Cata-baby.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JaceDraccus</div><div class="date">2016-05-04, 03:34 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn't misrepresent what you said, you were defending higher level mobs actually getting easier when you ding.<br />
<br />
I really was not. But I'm not sure I understand your point here in any case. Isn't a level 96 mob easier to kill at 96 than at 94? And a bit easier still at 97?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you feel differently than that, then you should clarify what you actually want to say. <br />
<br />
Ok. Here goes. I don't see a problem with having a brief delay in the scaling of mobs compared to players who have just dinged. It's no different than what happens now. You reach 95, level 94 mobs are a bit easier. Mobs higher than, oh, 97 or so should still be a challenge if not outright hard. <br />
<br />
But since most mobs will scale, there won't be a lot of mobs that much higher, if any. And overall I doubt the effect of this scaling-lag will be any different from now, when you move from fighting 94s at 95 to fighting 95s. Will you really even notice?<br />
<br />
<br />
Otherwise, just getting all salty because someone disagrees and you get nasty with them makes you look like a childish, selfish, Cata-baby.<br />
<br />
A) And you're not getting salty at Blizz because you disagree with them...?<br />
B) 'Dimwit' is 'salty' and 'nasty' on your planet? Aw, diddums, I'm sowwy I bwuised your ickle feewings.<br />
C) Cata-baby? Was... was that supposed to be... something? Anything?</div></div><hr />
