Patch 8.1 - Elite PvP Titles and Queue Times<br />
Patch 8.1 added new elite titles (https://www.wowdb.com/titles?filter-search=elite) rewarded from PvP.<br />
High PvP Queue Times<br />
We've noticed this increase in queue times as well, particularly for highly-rated players. We're currently investigating to find a fix, but this was not intended. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1074846320186208256))<br />
<br />
PvP Titles<br />
the PvP title NAME the Elite CLASS, added in 8.1 will this title only last for the season, or is a title for keeps, once its earned for said character/characters of said class?<br />
Elite titles are only active during the season in which they are earned. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1074826864235958272))<br />

Don Your Holiday Apparel—The Feast of Winter Veil Has Begun!<br />
The fine folks of Smokywood Pastures aren’t letting a little thing like war between the Horde and the Alliance get in the way of spreading holiday cheer—or gaining a bit of profit. Winter Veil has begun in Azeroth, and with it come all the fripperies, fineries, and delectable comestibles of the holiday.<br />
<br />
When: December 16 – January 2<br />
Where: Initial holiday quests can be found in Orgrimmar and Ironforge, but festive decorations can be found throughout the world.<br />
<br />
Let your spirit be light by stepping into one of the Giant Snow Globes* found outside of the Ironforge Bank, in Orgrimmar overlooking the Valley of Wisdom, or in the Broken Isles in Dalaran. It’s a truly transformative experience letting your inner Greatfather Winter helper out. A little /dance will spread the joy to those around you.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
The Abominable Greench is (still) a mean one, but we’re sure that once you’ve filled up on the fine foods and beverages from Smokywood Pastures, you’re bound to put a stop to his reign of terror in the Hillsbrad Foothills. The quest You’re a Mean One… is now available to players level 60 and up.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of holiday hats to be found on a variety of bosses from dungeons in the Broken Isles, Northrend, and more. You just need to decide which color hat you want. Will it be green or red?<br />
<br />
*May experience some shrinkage with use<br />
**Please /dance responsibly. Side effects include joy and laughter. Wait at least 30 minutes after eating Smokywood Pastures fine festive foods to avoid unpleasant side effects.<br />

<br />
Doesn't seem to come from the Stolen Present insofar as I can tell - might be a random gift from the ones under the tree (when they become available).</div></div><hr />

It will be from the presents under the tree. Last years presents are now in the stolen presents.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are a tonf of other specs that could use that smal buff way more. Blizzard will ALWAYS bend over backwards for frost. Sure, arcane is GREAT right now, and fire looks good (in PVE) but we can't have mages learning new tricks now can we?</div></div><hr />

<br />
you're a special kind of stupid aren't you?<br />
<br />
frost got massively nerfed this last patch, this small % buff was to help offset the massive reduction in power frost previously had, when you learn to read patch notes come back to me with this kind of asinine response, until then stop wasting bandwidth.</div></div><hr />
