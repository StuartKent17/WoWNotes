Everyone gets exalted eventually, the racial letting you hit it sooner isn't anything special -- now the only exception would be for people after the Paragon mounts, then it's handy as it's a constant grind out with Legion's rep. Beyond that, meh.</div></div><hr />

You’re crazy. Human rep racial is OP as hell especially when there are raiding benefits to hitting exalted quicker, getting flying faster and doubly OP for mount collectors. I’d take it over a lot of other facials in the game atm.</div></div><hr />

The Zandalari Trolls are the original trolls of Azeroth residing on the continent of Zandalar (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Zandalar). They have a rich history and a proud heritage. Zandalari society worships Loa (https://wow.gamepedia.com/Loa), animal gods and protectors. They also have a bond with the many dinosaur species found on the planet. The Horde are seeking to gain the trust of this tall-standing race to counter Alliance aggression.<br />

They actually make a lot more sense than any other race. Also remember that &quot;Paladin&quot; is just a Gameplay Class. Tauren Paladins aren't technically Paladins, they just use their gameplay as it is the closest match to their Class.</div></div><hr />

People say &quot;best for last&quot; but that's not generally very true with Blizzard. In my experience the things they reveal last for an upcoming expansion are usually rush-jobs - things they slap together at the last minute to make deadline. :(<br />
<br />
I really hope that is *not* the case for DI dwarves; I've been wanting since vanilla to racechange my very first priest character (a dwarf I tried to give dusky/ashen skin &amp; flaming orange hair) into a DI.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but they are called Paladins in-game and they have the spells and skills of Paladins. It totally ruins the immersion.</div></div><hr />

The classes are most likely placeholder. We already know DI can be pallies, but they weren't listed in the datamining. Chances are, they just have the same classes as normal trolls from now due to them being copied over.</div></div><hr />

I'm just let down they can't be neither monks, paladins or death knights.<br />

<br />
Blood elves would be a good fit, they have even had some NPC druids.<br />
<br />
Blood Elves can't shapeshift. The &quot;druids&quot; in game just cast resto spells, like Gilnean harvest witches. Due to their upbringing and race being the exact opposite of &quot;connected to nature&quot; they cannot control the &quot;beast within&quot; and would lose their mind as well as their human form if they ever attempted. <br />
It's why only the more &quot;tribal&quot; races and worgen (who have to control the beast as a necessity (a trick they learn from night elf druids in the starting zone in the first place, lorewise they cannot shapeshift before that part of the quest chain) can be playable druids. Blood elves are the opposite of everything a druid needs to be and should therefore be the last race in the game to become a druid.</div></div><hr />
