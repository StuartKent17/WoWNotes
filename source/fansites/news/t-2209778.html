&quot;Part of the reason is storytelling. The team is trying to create a global narrative, the forces of the Alliance, Horde, Legionfall, all building towards an event.&quot;<br />
<br />
Might be me, but from my point of view it's more like &quot;It's to keep you subbed so we give you little things every week to keep you going&quot;.<br />
Not saying I'd like everything at once or none at all, but they didn't get the middle ground and frustrated quite some people (not using numbers since I know people with throw their pitchforks at me for doing so).<br />
<br />
And what Touch of Anarchy said, the line he quoted became their standard &quot;to answer&quot; line to shut down any feedback.</div></div><hr />

When NH came out I believe I had 5. Now I have 11, and by the time the patch comes out I will probably have at least 13 or 14. It is a bit lame that people getting new legendary drops won't have to perform a task, but I may have to perform one up to 14 times. I am not asking for a free upgrade to all my legendaries, but I hope it isn't gated basically a week at a time like it was with this first round up legendary upgrades. It'd be a bit ridiculous if i had to wait 14 weeks to get all my legendaries to a maxed level where it would feel more rewarding to swap them around for different game play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If that is the case I would rather they just didn't make the challenges we got then. The whole reason everyone loved green fire was that it made you use all your abilities, including ones that most people forgot they had, to solve different mechanics and you couldn't just dps race down the boss. Instead we got generic and poorly balanced universal challenges that clearly took development time away from the rest of the Broken Isle. The end result being that Blizz spread themselves too thin, making both the challenges and the Broken Isle lacking in content and not living up to what they were marketed as.</div></div><hr />

They gated out this patch so long that it's clearly only to keep subs paying forever with little to no actual &quot;new&quot; stuff to do. I'm done. I've kept coming back, hoping it would get better, but it doesn't. They keep saying they've learned, but they haven't. Please don't give me the standard line about them being in business to make money. Because that's wrong. They are in the business to make games that their customers enjoy. And THAT will lead to them making money. The current WoW devs just don't get that anymore. Now it's all about the bottom line and not about letting people have fun anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You mean the concept of it they had since the beginning and that they stated in clear terms several times over the years? Yeah, if this is only news to you now, you probably shouldn't be playing video games. They said that was their intent the first time they implemented achievement based flying, they said they were happy with it, they said they were going to continue with it, and in Legion they said again that they wanted it to be available only after you've done the content that would be trivialized by it. You can only be so mad at Blizzard for your own stupidity.</div></div><hr />

How about acting professional? He is certainly allowed to hear the criticisms from players at large and dismiss them if he doesn't think they are valid, it's his job after all. That doesn't excuse being rude to your player base / customers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As far as i understood they, as a team, put a lot of effort into this, and they were too certain whole thing was a success. However, they raised the bar very high prior to the release, and did not get the response they expected from the community at all. Now it sounds like they don't really know what else to do. <br />
<br />
To me, he didn't sound much aggresive, but rather desperate and frustrated. Not really the attitude you want to see from a developer to be honest.</div></div><hr />

So you basicly lied on Blizzcon. What update do we want? How about undoin his death and bringing him back as he was the only revelant troll that there was?! And how about Darkspear racial leader? Oh right, it's trolls so who cares?! Let us see more humans and more elves.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stories are told in a way that makes sense for the narrative.<br />
<br />
They don't make sense since WoD! And Didn't in Cata too, and didn't in TBC. <br />
<br />
And to quote player from us forums :<br />
<br />
You made Sylvanas Warchief because &quot;Da spirits&quot; (meaning the Loa, who hate the Undead because they are unnatural btw) and then she ran away to enslave a Val'kyr Goddess because reasons<br />
<br />
You screwed Vol'Jin with entire Broken Shore scenario, you made his entire build up completely pointless, and you wasted your resources with killing him off, and that was one promising and balanced character. You totally obliberated troll racial lore in the process. And you have a guts to say that thing? <br />
<br />
Blizzard must really hate trolls. But the attitude of their employees is truly revolting.</div></div><hr />

Man I can't even start to count how much attention trolls got over the lifespan of this game. <br />
<br />
Vanilla had tons of troll shit. Zul'farrak, stranglethorn, zulgurub.... etc and much more.<br />
TBC had zul 'aman<br />
wrath had zul'drak which also had a dungeon<br />
Cata had horde trolls starting zone revamped. and 4.1 happened<br />
MoP. half a troll raid in 5.2. Zandalari returning and top of the cake, voljin as warchief<br />
WoD indeed had nothing really<br />

<br />
They don't make sense since WoD! And Didn't in Cata too, and didn't in TBC. <br />
<br />
And to quote player from us forums :<br />
<br />
<br />
You screwed Vol'Jin with entire Broken Shore scenario, you made his entire build up completely pointless, and you wasted your resources with killing him off, and that was one promising and balanced character. You totally obliberated troll racial lore in the process. And you have a guts to say that thing? <br />
<br />
Blizzard must really hate trolls. But the attitude of their employees is truly revolting.<br />
<br />
Don't worry. Rumor has it that 7.3 will include a troll raid.</div></div><hr />

Either they haven't revealed something yet, which feels to close to .2.5 to have that, or he was meaning something else when he said that and his wife's got crossed (hey, it happens).<br />
I was not a fan of the story telling thing. Like someone else said, I don't really care about the cinematics as they could show them for 1 side and not the other as much as I'm concerned; however, there's Troll resurrection/possession that could be covered with Voljin, there's the whole Horde not trusting Sylvanas thing which could make what trust they have in her weaker due to how she's been behaving. There's obviously more Anduin that could be shown. What about the neutrals? How's the Kirin Tor doing without Jaina and vice versa? Why hasn't Wrathion shown up, either in a supportive or demeaning role? Hell, he's the one who saw the Legion invading Azeroth and was trying to assist Garrosh with the Iron Horde. <br />
The point is, there's technically a lot that could be developed and wouldn't even take cinematics. Make in game quests or dungeons or even scenarios delving into these issues. <br />
His response definitely felt like a dismissal of some things players would like to see and loose end such that could be tied up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What!? That is the first time I've ever seen anyone talk bad about Cata's first tier. BoT and BWD were amazing. It's literally the only thing that was good about Cata. And Firelands? No thanks, that place was shit, the only interesting fight was Ragnaros and maybe Alysrazor. The rest were dull encounters, or dumb ones like Rhyolith. <br />
<br />
I'd like to see BoT/BWD as Timewalking for Cata. I agree with you for Ulduar with WOTLK, and maybe i'd say ToT for MoP. If they end up doing a vanilla timewalking, I would love to see them do AQ</div></div><hr />

Well, let's check the Blizzcon 2016 Q&amp;A:<br />
Q: Now that Vol’jin is dead and the Darkspear have no major lore characters, who leads the Darkspear?<br />
<br />
A: “How not to make this spoilery?” Afrasiabi asks. The audience tells him to just ruin it, he says no. He says there’s more to Vol’jin’s story in time.<br />

I was worried that they were going to have it as a once a year thing tying to the anniversary or something. But this is good. I'd add ICC for Wrath as, like BT, it's the iconic raid from that expansion next to Ulduar. The only problem being that Ulduar doesn't tie into the main story for Wrath, it was only a side store that tied into Northrend's lore, basically. For Cata it would either be Bastion of Twilight or Firelands, cause I'm sure no one wants Dragon Soul even though it might make more sense given Deathwing's the final boss. For MoP it's either Mogu'shan Vaults or Throne of Thunder as I feel both of those capture the feel of the expansion pretty well. And, let's be real, I don't think a lot of people are looking to do SoO again any time soon. And when they bring around WoD timewalking? Any of the three raids would work, I feel, but it'll probably be down to either Blackrock Foundry or Hellfire Citadel, as those are pretty iconic to the expansion. Even if HFC was out for a stupidly long time.<br />
<br />
Other than that, I feel like they're just making excuses for the way they're handling 7.2 going by the synopsis. Christ.</div></div><hr />

These are paraphrases of what was said in the Q&amp;A. That isn't what they said verbatim. They were responding to a question about them calling 7.2 the largest patch in WoW history. They were talking about how it probably was a mistake to say that because even though there is a large about of &quot;stuff&quot; and they put a lot of work in 7.2 (they said something like there is more voice over in 7.2 alone than all the voice over in MoP at launch) none of that really matters because A.) amount of work put in =/= amount of content available and B.) there is a lot of class specific content in 7.2 (12 class campaign, 12 class mount acquisition questlines, 7 different solo challenges) so most people will only see a small fraction of that if they only play 1 or 2 characters.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, Ion said that they don't plan on doing more class specific stuff in Argus. I hope this is true because overall 7.2 definitely does feel lacking (especially with these weekly farm quests).</div></div><hr />

I think it's great that players are able to play as a Fire Mage with only Fire spells in their rotation. It feels great thematically. Don't get me wrong, I loved it in MoP when Fire had access to Deep Freeze in PvP, it allowed them to set up some really powerful burst and gave the gameplay more depth. But I want Blizzard to achieve this without delving into the other specs' abilities.<br />
<br />
If people really want Frost spells back, I think Blizzard should provide a choice between having a few Frost spells or going full on Fire. Or maybe just tie Frost spells to utility, idk. Maybe they should have baby steps towards it just so they don't mess up balance.<br />

Wrath - all the raids I've farmed over and over. Maybe Naxx, so we can have a 3rd incarnation of it?<br />
Cata - Does Baradin Hold count? Seriously though, I did DS 38 times at the time so I'm not too keen on doing it again. Maybe Blackwing Descent. <br />
MoP - Throne of Thunder. I feel it's one of the better raids. But I also like Heart of Fear and Terrace of the Endless Spring. MSV not so much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The team would have wanted to add another couple light requirements to Part 2, such as donate to buildings or kill elites, something that you would have gotten over time.<br />
<br />
This one being the most, sack the fuckers. We've all done our fair share of seeing and experiencing the content without needing more - I really hope they dont take this attitude into the next expac. <br />
<br />
<br />
The invasion achievement being required for flying would have been annoying, no one wants to get up at 3 AM for an invasion<br />
<br />
No shit Sherlock, but that was clearly going to be the case before you released it, it should never, ever have gone live it's just sloppy. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are Artifact unlock challenge lines, class mount quests, artifact challenges, which took lots development resources. If you are only playing one character, you may only see 1/12th of the content.<br />
<br />
This shit right fucking here. I play multiple characters, so I see this other content, but I have no issue with people who only play one character. That shouldn't be a fucking excuse or an answer to a question when asked about why content feels lacking. That's just piss poo and not on in my book. &quot;You want more to do? Go do all of this again on an alt, some things change!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
The team learned from this and will improve in the future.<br />
<br />
Just do something like you did in Cataclysm in the fire planes, a leveling zone which got updated, which then got a brand new zone, with changing dailys and a fairly lengthy rewarding quest line, but one which completely wasn't necessary to progress or to anything. I know people complain about cata and those dailies were cycled through pretty quick, but its by far the best system we've seen so far. Could you imagine if 7.2 was like that patch as well as the class campaign and the content from BS in general? It would of been an immense patch<br />
<br />
<br />
What more would you like to see?<br />
<br />
This sounds sassy to me<br />
<br />
<br />
Heirloom upgrades are planned for Patch 7.2.5.<br />
<br />
It's about time, although a lot of us have our main character (and a fair few all classes) to 110 by now, might of been better to release these with 7.1<br />
<br />
<br />
If you are looking to fill a PuG, it would be awesome if you wanted to look for a specific class rather than just grabbing the highest item level player.<br />
<br />
This would be nice.... but to a degree. I hated pugging Nax in wrath because finding a priest for MC was a nightmare on my smaller server, even now with it being older content, Black Rock Foundry is a pain in the arse with the heart of the mountain. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are no plans to add Armies of Legionfall reputation to the invasions<br />
<br />
I understand why, but I disagree with it, you should get rep (even if its at the expense of something else) for completing them. Otherwise its like Legionfall saying fuck off, we don't care what you do outside of the broken shore <br />
<br />
<br />
What raid would you like to see for each expansion's timewalking event<br />
<br />
Molten core - Let people who can use Sulfurus and thunder fury get its apperance<br />
Nax - Ateish + Corrupted ashbringer (Yup, screw you pallies, I want it on my DK :p) same as the above<br />
Kara - I'd just like to go back to the original kara tbh, I've got a level 70 who raids it, but ever since the Wrath buff / nerfs on pre patch, it was just faceroll<br />
Uld - Let the healers have their mace appearance <br />
ICC - Shadowmourne appearance for those that can use it<br />
FL - Let the casters have the staff + fuck it, let the casters have the ability to change into the mount when they x mog it<br />
DS - Let the rogues have their daggers <br />
SoO - Reintroduction of the CM gear, Each boss has a chance to drop a CM gear token to redeem (Yea thats right I went there bitches)<br />
HFC - Reintroduction of the CM gear, Each boss has a chance to drop a CM gear token to redeem (Yea thats right I went there bitches)<br />
<br />
<br />
These chests still mostly reward the same thing, which is underwhelming. The team will discuss this.<br />
<br />
Again, this should have been noticed before it went fucking live. How did you think the player base would react to getting a chest that requires 5x the amount of work, across a length of what two weeks? for it to reward nearly exactly the same rewards. I appreciate its all bonus loot and they didn't need to add anything. But fuck me as it is, I think I speak for a lot of people who would prefer them not to have added them <br />
<br />
<br />
You won't be able to use weapon illusions on your Artifacts.<br />
<br />
And this is precisely why I don't use most artifact skins. I personally love mongoose especially on glaives, so I'm using the default stater zone ones. same with nearly every other character and spec I have. <br />
<br />

<br />
So the typical bandwagon ... people like WOTLK but wast majority can't actually say why.<br />
WOTLK was a great expansion BUT lets not kid ourself, it had one of the most atrocious &quot;timegating&quot; to date, which was limited attempts. Also rep grind for shoulder enchant, of which you could only get a certain amount of rep / day, with no catchup mechanism if you missed a day. People like to forget these thing were part of the game even in WOTLK, plus many more but these are the ones i can remember from top of my head.. <br />
<br />
By RNG i'm guessing you mean gear RNG, which helps out the wast majority of players more then it hinders the high end raiders/min-maxers. In wotlk there was no way in hell that you could get top end raider equivalent items as a casual, now you can.<br />
<br />
Not much to say about flying, vocal minority always cries about it but there is probably a bigger part of the community that doesn't care either way, which means that there is really no right or wrong choice, just preference. I for one prefer achievement gated flying BUT i would prefer the achievement to be attainable soon after you hit max level for said expansion.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to be confrontational but the thing is people like to think they know better, but in fact they have no clue what impact, some of the suggestions on this forum, would have and what would be good for the game.</div></div><hr />

wotlk grew the playerbase to 12 mil and it retained that until cataclysm.<br />
<br />
obviously, there are aspects of the game that are done better now. nobody is saying to bring wotlk back 100% getting rid of all new things. just bring back the majority of the game systems from that time.<br />
<br />
rep grinding was fine. if you put in the time, you got what you wanted, at your own pace. you put on a tabard and went into dungeons. that was the right way to do it.<br />
<br />
with gear, not everyone needs omega gear. the badge gear in wotlk was fine. i went out in my badge gear and killed 10s of cultists above the argent tournament grounds, gathering up huge herds of them. all in badge gear.<br />
<br />
the most important thing is that wotlk let you play the game at your chosen pace for the most part. if you worked towards something, you got it sooner than someone that might not have worked at the same pace as you. that is how it should be. if you want it, you should be able to go out and get it.</div></div><hr />

What is hindering you in doing that now, what can't you do at your own pace? The only thing I can think of is the opening of the tomb quest line (which is basically irrelevant fluff), but staggering that makes sense since opening up the raid now or when 7.2 was released would be a big blow to the raiding community.<br />

<br />
sons of hodir did have those iron things you could turn in.<br />
<br />
but as for what you can't do at your own pace, you can't really target any specific gear. just have to go do things and hope you get lucky. if this were wotlk, i could probably go buy the relic i'm needing right now(maybe not with a specific effect, but at least the relic itself). you can't do rep grinds at your own pace, you're stuck waiting on wq's. then the story itself, i'd rather have it all there and available, just hidden behind reputation and i could grind that reputation with a tabard or killing shit.<br />
<br />
this is where personal responsibility comes in. if i want to go out and exhaust every piece of non-raid, dungeon, or daily content i have, i should be able to do that. if i want to pace myself on the story, that should be an option. some people will naturally pace their selves on the story, just due to not having the time to play as much as me. but i got all the time in the world, and i would blow through the story asap if i had that ability.<br />
<br />
you just have to put out the word that here it is, this is how it works, if you blow through it and have nothing else to do that's your doing and you have no real right to complain.</div></div><hr />

Well IMO you can target gear better then ever with nethershards. The gear you could buy in WOTLK was way, waaaay more limited then what is available for you in legion. Rep grinding was better for the most part yes, but as i pointed out the mandatory shit like sons of hodir was just as bad as it is now (at least now its not THAT mandatory).<br />
<br />

Heh, do you actually think that would work with the current community?<br />
People have proven that they can't pace them selfs and blow through content unless it's gated some way. Timegating is probably not the best option but what is ? At least timegating currently dosent hinder you in anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you just have to let it be known that's the amount of story you're getting, and that's that. sometimes you have to just put your foot down and leave it at that.<br />
<br />
as for targeting, the nethershard vendor is damn good, a real step in the right direction. the problem is with the relic token, it gives you a random relic. it'd be better if you could choose which type of relic you want, iron, or blood, etc. <br />
<br />
credit where it's due, the nethershard gear targeting is damn good and close throwback to wotlk. but it could be a bit better.</div></div><hr />

Really ? 7.2 is barely live and it already had an ilvl bump , and this is not an RPG it's a MMORPG at it's core and gearing usually lasted for 6 months+ before you had to regrind it , not 3 months. Is legion your 1st expansion ? probably.</div></div><hr />

So you dont want ilvl increase with each raid? that makes so much sense. What ilvl bump did 7.2 have? And just as fyi I have been playing since early TBC.<br />

That shouldn't be a fucking excuse or an answer to a question when asked about why content feels lacking. That's just piss poo and not on in my book. &quot;You want more to do? Go do all of this again on an alt, some things change!&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Just do something like you did in Cataclysm in the fire planes, a leveling zone which got updated, which then got a brand new zone, with changing dailys and a fairly lengthy rewarding quest line, but one which completely wasn't necessary to progress or to anything. I know people complain about cata and those dailies were cycled through pretty quick, but its by far the best system we've seen so far. Could you imagine if 7.2 was like that patch as well as the class campaign and the content from BS in general? It would of been an immense patch<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This sounds sassy to me<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It's about time, although a lot of us have our main character (and a fair few all classes) to 110 by now, might of been better to release these with 7.1<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
This would be nice.... but to a degree. I hated pugging Nax in wrath because finding a priest for MC was a nightmare on my smaller server, even now with it being older content, Black Rock Foundry is a pain in the arse with the heart of the mountain. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I understand why, but I disagree with it, you should get rep (even if its at the expense of something else) for completing them. Otherwise its like Legionfall saying fuck off, we don't care what you do outside of the broken shore <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Molten core - Let people who can use Sulfurus and thunder fury get its apperance<br /> 
Nax - Ateish + Corrupted ashbringer (Yup, screw you pallies, I want it on my DK :p) same as the above<br />
Kara - I'd just like to go back to the original kara tbh, I've got a level 70 who raids it, but ever since the Wrath buff / nerfs on pre patch, it was just faceroll<br />
Uld - Let the healers have their mace appearance <br />
ICC - Shadowmourne appearance for those that can use it<br />
FL - Let the casters have the staff + fuck it, let the casters have the ability to change into the mount when they x mog it<br />
DS - Let the rogues have their daggers <br />
SoO - Reintroduction of the CM gear, Each boss has a chance to drop a CM gear token to redeem (Yea thats right I went there bitches)<br />
HFC - Reintroduction of the CM gear, Each boss has a chance to drop a CM gear token to redeem (Yea thats right I went there bitches)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, this should have been noticed before it went fucking live. How did you think the player base would react to getting a chest that requires 5x the amount of work, across a length of what two weeks? for it to reward nearly exactly the same rewards. I appreciate its all bonus loot and they didn't need to add anything. But fuck me as it is, I think I speak for a lot of people who would prefer them not to have added them <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And this is precisely why I don't use most artifact skins. I personally love mongoose especially on glaives, so I'm using the default stater zone ones. same with nearly every other character and spec I have. <br />
<br />
Besides those issues, they addressed quite a few things nicely<br />
<br />
Using profanities makes your remarks unreadable, or maybe you don't want your words be read.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Flurryfang</div><div class="date">2017-04-29, 04:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What timewalking raids would I want to see?<br />
All of them. Every single raid in the game today.<br />
<br />
Why? It gives players OPTIONS.<br />
Everybody has differing opinions on what raid was awesome, what raid was meh, and what raid sucked.<br />
We need MORE options, not less.<br />
<br />
If you want a matchmaking system to work, you can't do that. If you think that some people have hard opions about some of the dungeons in the random dungeon pull, be ready to see that explode 10 times more if you put a raid-instance poll together xD<br />
<br />
Giving too many options can lead to a bad experience, by splitting the community up in tiny small bubbles, that breaks very easily.</div></div><hr />

Legion is easily the best or 2nd best expansion this game has had. I don't really know what people are asking for anymore. If you're bored of the content, unsubscribe.</div></div><hr />

Right .... so why have you bothered to reply to it then? You know besides wasting my - fucking - time<br />

It was one of those interviews, where i just nooded along with everything said and had a few &quot;oohhh&quot; once in while. But again, it was good :D I understood all of his arguments and he gave some good insight into the hard work of making an online product, that is supposed to satisfy as many of its millions of players :)</div></div><hr />

Why the hell do they still keep saying patch 7.2 contains a raid?<br />
<br />
NO ONE CAN ACCESS IT!! IT'S NOT EVEN FINISHED!! Stop saying patch 7.2 came with a raid, because it's literally NOT there!</div></div><hr />
