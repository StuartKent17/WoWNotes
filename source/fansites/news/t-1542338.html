Faction Cities Moved to Ashran<br />
Mumper let everyone know last night that the faction cities that were originally supposed to be in Frostfire Ridge and Shadowmoon Valley were moved to just outside of Ashran. This has led to a long discussion on the forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1542025-Karabor-and-Bladespire-are-no-longer-our-Capital-hubs).<br />

<br />
Warlords of Draenor Beta Invites<br />
Bashiok answered (https://twitter.com/Bashiok/with_replies) a few questions about this invite wave on Twitter.<br />
<br />
<br />
Invites in this wave were targeted to WoW Veterans rather than being random. Not every veteran will get an invite in this wave.<br />
Both US and EU players were invited in this wave.<br />
PAX keys are not enabled yet.<br />
You don't need to be subscribed to the game currently to get an invite.<br />

Warlords of Draenor Alpha Characters Wiped<br />
If you had alpha access, you will find that all of your characters have been wiped. If you are in beta, you may be able to copy your Live account data and characters after maintenance is complete.<br />

<br />
While that appears to be the case from skimming the thread, forums represent a minority of WoW players and may not be indicative of a general consensus (most players overall may be indifferent)<br />
<br />
Also most of the discussion appears to be based on a gut reaction to the change rather than any kind of in depth analysis or reasoning.<br />
<br />
There are pro's and con's to the change, as with any change. Though the idea of such beautiful areas serving as our new capitals is certainly something to miss should they stay with this new design decision.<br />
<br />
I would personally like to keep Bladespire and Karabour as our capitals though I can understand some of the implied reasons for the change (They haven't given us much to go on other than a few tweets)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zorgen</div><div class="date">2014-06-27, 04:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what exactly are Bladespire and Karabor going to be now? There's no raids or dungeons located there and no cities so.. a simple quest hub? Seems like a lot of work to make those places just for a few quests.<br />
<br />
Also, we haven't seen anything at all for these &quot;new&quot; capital cities, does that mean the game is going to get further delayed so they can create new hubs from the ground up?</div></div><hr />

Don't like this. :/ I think people with current active accounts should get priority since we are obviously playing right now and not on a break! :c If someone has an inactive account they are probably too busy or bored with WoW to care about a beta key. :c</div></div><hr />

<br />
Giving keys to people who don't currently play gives another side of feedback. How can I put this without sounding rude... If you're still subscribed now you're probably either a very casual raider or the type that just goes along with whatever Blizz does. You're likely the kind of player whose feedback will be &quot;Oh, cool!&quot; whereas the ones who are not currently subscribed are more likely to find fault with the game I would imagine.<br />
<br />
Also, it's a ploy to get people who aren't currently subbed interested again. It may even make people who are not subbed sub as WoW is back in their head again.</div></div><hr />

I agree with the part of your post where you're saying that giving beta access to people with currently inactive accounts can be a great incentive for them to return, with which as a business decision I can totally get behind.<br />
<br />
The other part of your post, where you put the current active player base into two brackets, I just find it wrong.<br />
<br />
I'm not a casual raider, nor do I agree with everything what Blizzard does, I'm still paying the sub money. Why? Because I enjoy playing with the people I play with, be it whatever aspect of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thanks - see, I have no idea where Karabor is so when he says that the faction hubs are near murderville and you can hang out in Karabor (again, no idea what or where that is) if you want to, but the portals and vendors are IN murderville, I tend to think that the portals and vendors are IN murderville. Because that's what he said. <br />
<br />
I think/hope he meant that you can hang out in Karabor but the portals and vendors have moved to the new faction hubs which are on the outskirts of murderville but not actually in murderville. <br />
<br />
My confusion was &quot;there's nor forced pvp there&quot; &lt;-- sure, but is 'there' where the portals are? Imagine if Dalaran never hard portals to the old world, that you had to travel to Wintergrasp and go inside the keep to reach the only portals back. That's what I was unclear on.</div></div><hr />

There are a lot of guilds and individuals who are on breaks just waiting for the expansion. These folks tend to unsub until the xpac comes out. I'm sure Blizzard just wants to make sure to include those folks. There are likely other reasons as well.</div></div><hr />

Set up all your spells and keybinds then log out and back in. That should save your settings on the server.</div></div><hr />

Anyways, glad to see WoD finally entering beta stage. At this point, the earliest possible date we could see release would be mid-to-late September, or mid October in my mind. I'm leaning more towards the former, though, because I doubt Blizzard wants a year long content drought.</div></div><hr />

I was more excited about the Alliance one despite playing Horde but still; Come on Blizzard! Don't do this to us! Seriously, the idea of having the Black Temple as a city is one of the most exciting things for me regarding this expansion, seriously. Please please PLEASE re-consider this, I know that there's obviously more reasons to it then 'eh, we felt like Ashran would be nicer' - But whatever, the reasons are, i'm begging you to re-consider :/<br />
<br />
This is coming from someone who LOVES PvP (especially World), so if the goal was to get people into the world and take part in some World PvP, then please no. It's not worth it, I'm looking forward to Ashran but don't force me into it please, I really really really really REALLY really really want to explore these two cities :/.</div></div><hr />

I've played two or three of the betas - it's a lot of fun. You aren't making any of your characters better, stuff's really broken, they normally don't allow addons so your (my) nice comfy ElvUI isn't there, etc. It's kinda interesting but unless you LIVE to play on the PTR each and every time it's up, I no longer see the appeal.</div></div><hr />

I have an account ilve since week 2 of vanilla with no break, never bought any wow store BS (outside server Transfer and faction change, cause I'm weak). And I have the beta.<br />

Seems like it, atleast i've got access to beta and i've yet to buy WoD.</div></div><hr />

Same.. I was in vanilla beta when it was open, and been here ever since. Not once have I gotten an invite to any expansion. I got in the Hearthstone, and Heroes of the Storm betas tho =\</div></div><hr />

Your reading skills are atrocious.<br />

Your reasoning on the other hand, is absolutely batshit crazy atrocious and you need help.<br />

Ooh. An internet tough guy. I'm shattered.<br />
<br />
If you honestly believe that these boards would be the right place to &quot;beg&quot; for a beta invite, you don't understand how Blizzard's beta system works. In any case, there is absolutely zero reason to treat other posters badly in a thread that's comprised of very casual comments and isn't in any way meant to be (a) a place to try and get into beta - that's not how it works or (b) a serious assessment of how the beta selection process plays out.<br />
<br />
I certainly hope your day/evening improves. Take care, and good gaming to you.</div></div><hr />

OnT: Been playing since early -05 and I frankly couldn't care less about beta. It'll be buggy, unfinished and you'll just get burned out before actual release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What makes me wonder though is what does it take to be a &quot;veteran&quot;?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2014-06-28, 02:21 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ugh.. why did they have to mention vets.. now we will get a 20 page thread filled with everyone complaining because they are a vet and not in the game.<br />
<br />
Also, it is smart that they moved the hubs to the PVP zone. Their goal is probably to make it easier for people to get into the battle ( and thus larger battles)... which anyone who did Wintergrasp can tell you, they were awesome when there were dozens and dozens of people on each side.</div></div><hr />

To be honest I am on the fence with WoD. I really think I need some time playing it to decide if my time with WoW is over or not.</div></div><hr />

There were probably enough people in the WoW original beta who kept their accounts until now that they don't need to invite anyone else... I had it since mars 2005 and I havn't got a beta invite either!</div></div><hr />
