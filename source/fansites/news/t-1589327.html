Character copies don't work yet (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/337800-602-ptr-testing-has-begun/#post28), but you can use a template.<br />
We're in the process pushing the latest 6.0.2 PTR Build to the Battle.net app. You should be able to install the 6.0.2 PTR via the Battle.net app shortly.<br />
<br />
As a reminder, the Battle.net app is mandatory in order to play WoW, and all updating/installing will now go through it. If you don't have the Battle.net app, get it here! http://us.battle.net/en/app/<br />
<br />
If you have an older version of the PTR build, you may need to uninstall it if your version doesn't automatically update. In order to install the PTR, make sure the Region/Account dropdown box is set to PTR: Mists of Pandaria. Example Picture<br />
<br />
More troubleshooting steps can be found in this support article.<br />
<br />
Key things to note with this build:<br />
<br />
Build version is version 6.0.2. 18838. The Mac Version of the PTR client is not working quite yet. We hope to have it working in the near future, but I do not have an ETA at this time. Character Copy is currently down on the PTR. When we bring it up, it'll be via the new in-game option, found on the Character Selection screen. There is currently a known crash that occurs when changing to/from Windowed Mode while in game, or changing the Resolution in-game. We're working to fix that, although it may require a new build.<br />
<br />
<br />
As in previous PTR tests for the Expansion Patches, this PTR will mimic what your live retail servers will look like on 6.0.2 Patch day (as opposed to the expansion launch date of Novemeber 13th).<br />
<br />
This means that some restrictions will be in place compared to our Beta Realms:<br />
<br />
Level Cap remains at level 90. Tanaan Jungle, Ashran, and the other Draenor zones will not be accessible. Garrisons, new dungeons, and new raids will not be accessible.<br />
<br />

Tanaan Stress Test on September 10<br />
Join us September 10 at 3:00 pm PDT as we stress test the Tanaan Jungle starting experience! We’ll be turning the level 100 realms off during this test, and ask that you come make new level 90’s to help us put the starting experience through its paces. We appreciate the help, and your assistance here will help go a long way to ensuring a smooth expansion launch.<br />
<br />
If you have any feedback on the zone please post it in the Tanaan Jungle Quests forum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course it won't feature the new models, it's a pre-WoD patch and not WoD itself. Only the beta has the new models since they are testing all of the new expansion content whereas the PTR is only for the current expansion and upcoming patches for the same expansion.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure they said not terribly long ago that the pre-exp event / patch should hit in mid October, or about a month before the expac lands.</div></div><hr />

Mount Journal now lists all mounts that have been collected on the account. Ones that the character is unable to use will be displayed in red.<br />
<br />
Players can now designate a mount as favorite, placing it at the top of the collected mounts list.<br />
Summon Random Favorite Mount has been added, randomly summoning a mount that’s usable for the area from the favorites list.<br />
<br />
All flying mounts are now able to be used as a ground mount in areas that do not allow flying.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
About damn time!</div></div><hr />

Yeah you would think they would trim it down but who knows, but from what I have been hearing the cloak would be very useable till about 97 or 99 but that's just a guess.. And well they should of halved the amount of sigils secrets and runestones needed as well..</div></div><hr />

Leveling green? hardly,you need something higher item level then it (616 fully upgraded) + even then you have to count for 3 green stats,aoe + a gem socket,its gonna last till at least you're done with leveling,maybe even into hc dungeons</div></div><hr />

<br />
You could before. A few ways.<br />
<br />
1. Have alts saved to Yogg/LK, extend each week, have friend get your main and alt in same group, bam just do last boss.<br />
<br />
2. Thorim: Start encounter, tag first big rock dude in tunnel (don't damage), use speed pots/drums/etc to get back to room, start timer once the lightneing ball hits the entrance to hallway, at 18 seconds lay some AOE, get behind gate, kill rock guy, go up kill second rock guy, stay a bit away from thorim, let mobs from Arena come to you, kill all, speed in and tag thorim.<br />
<br />
3. Dreamwalker: be an engineer, cloak from BQ to Sind. Would count as the 3 tier bosses being killed and LK would open.<br />

The intro quest line perhaps? And yes i'm sure they put copy down on purpose.<br />
As for raiding there's a buff on the wod beta that scales you to appropriate ilvl, and such buff isn't anything new on betas / ptrs.<br />

I think that was their point. Engineering isn't exactly a big money maker. So aside from Jeeves it doesn't look all that appealing in WoD. No more pop deterrence, hit nitro, and clear all da bubbles on H Malk I guess. That was honestly fun. The other hunter and I had that down to such a science we were competing to see who go back to their spot first. Oh well. <br />
<br />
I dunno if I'll switch profs or not. We're still going to want to have access to Jeeves on progression. Guess I need to talk to the other engineers in the guild and see who's keeping it.</div></div><hr />

This is the first time a pre-expansion patch has failed to deliver fun. Not excitement, or hype, or amazing expectations. Just simple fun, I got none of it.<br />
None of the new things feel new, or interesting, or powerful.<br />
My geared-to-the-teeth fire mage feels like playing a level 30 character, not only in damage but also in the crippled feeling left behind by the removal of all the abilities it lost.<br />
The damage differential between level 90 pve and level 99 (level boosted in bg) pvp is so abysmal - 510k on a dummy, 20k on a player - that it feels like I'm playing a totally different game.<br />
<br />
And not to rail on bugs on the PTR too much, since the whole idea is to find and report them, but for all the talk about removing hit and exp as stats, my frost novas miss so much I wonder if the stat scaling was poorly done - spoilers: it was.</div></div><hr />

Is it just your frost novas or is it everything? I'm not on the ptr but if its everything its because they copied the raid dummies from Beta, which are effective level 103 (as WoD Bosses). You'll miss a fuck load if you're attacking a level 103 target as level 90.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The boss dummies are almost definitely upgraded to 103, since everything misses. As for pvp, novas were the most noticeable since they're aoe and their effect is pretty binary (root, no root), but in truth everything missed. Pet novas &quot;seemed&quot; to miss the most.<br />
<br />
In hindsight, it could very well be that, for some targets, roots had just DR'd a lot faster than I'm used to. It all feels so crippled.</div></div><hr />
