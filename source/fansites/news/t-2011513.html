<br />
Legion - Fishing Artifact<br />
Legion adds the Underlight Angler (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133755-underlight-angler), which has a tree of artifact traits (http://beta.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#9AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA) that gives you access to traits like:<br />
<br />
<br />
Undercurrent (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/201891-undercurrent) - Teleport to the nearest fishing node.<br />
Fishrender's Blessing (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/201948-fishrenders-blessing) - Become a fish when underwater, allowing you to breathe water and swim rapidly<br />
Surface Tension (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/201944-surface-tension) - Walk on water.<br />
Luremaster (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/201946-luremaster) - Increases duration of Legion lures and baits<br />
Bloodfishing (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/201945-bloodfishing) - Grants a chance to catch Blood of Sargeras (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/124124-blood-of-sargeras) when fishing in the Broken Isles<br />
Better Luck Next Time (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/201943-better-luck-next-time) - Grants a chance to catch boots when fishing in the Broken Isles<br />
Fishbane (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/201952-fishbane) - Increases autoattack damage done to aquatic beasts<br />
<br />
<br />
Prerequisites<br />
<br />
Bigger Fish to Fry (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/10596-bigger-fish-to-fry) - Catch all of the rare Legion fish<br />
The Wish Remover (http://beta.wowdb.com/achievements/10722-the-wish-remover) - Fish up all of the coins from Dalaran's fountain<br />
Fishing skill at 800<br />
<br />
<br />
Acquisition<br />
<br />
Soon after meeting the prerequisites, you will fish up the Luminous Pearl (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133887-luminous-pearl)<br />
You then take the Pearl to Khadgar (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/40960-luminous-pearl).<br />
Khadgar gives you a pat on the head (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/40961-the-dalaran-fountain) and tells you to put in in the Dalaran fountain.<br />
Nat Pagle appears in the fountain with a quest for you (http://beta.wowdb.com/quests/41010-fish-frenzy), sending you to a Val'sharah scenario to look at the fish frenzy going on:<br />
<br />
Kill Murlocs - Slay all of the murlocs on the island.<br />
Fishing - Fish up the Gloaming Frenzies.<br />
Delivery - Give Nat your Gloaming Frenzies.<br />
What's below? - Fish up what's been disturbing the frenzies.<br />
Mglrrp - Slay Mglrrp.<br />
<br />
After slaying Mglrrp, Nat realizes that part of him would make a great fishing pole. <br />
The pearl you fished up is used as an Artifact forge (that doesn't appear to be working correctly right now).<br />
Leveling up the Artifact requires you to equip the Underlight Angler and catch rare fish that grant Artifact Experience (beta.wowdb.com/spells/221474-throw-back#related:used-by-item;_!).<br />

Weekly Legion Developer Q&amp;As Starting This Thursday!<br />
The time of the Burning Legion’s return is fast approaching, and as we begin our final preparations, we thought it’d be a good time to start up a new series of live developer Q&amp;A sessions!<br />
<br />
Every Thursday for the next several weeks, starting at 11 a.m. PT, we’ll be going live on Twitch.tv/Warcraft (http://twitch.tv/Warcraft) to answer questions submitted by the World of Warcraft community. Each week will feature a different developer, and we’ll be looking for questions that focus on their particular role on the World of Warcraft development team.<br />
<br />
To kick things off, we’re starting with Assistant Game Director Ion “Watcher” Hazzikostas. Ion is involved in nearly every aspect of World of Warcraft development, so for this session, feel free to submit questions on any aspect of the Legion expansion. You can do so by posting in this forum thread (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745075688#1) or via Twitter using the hashtag #LegionQA.<br />
<br />
We’re really looking forward to getting the chance to dive in and answer as much as we can, so we hope to see you Thursday at 11 a.m. PT! <br />
<br />

Warcraft Movie - China Box Office Update<br />
The Warcraft Movie slowed a little bit in China on Monday, with the total now at $163M (https://twitter.com/ChinaBoxOffice/status/742391460817952768). Jackie Chan commented (https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/jun/13/jackie-chan-warcraft-success-china-scares-americans-chinese-box-office-blockbuster) on the movie's success. <br />

damn they are really hardcore, i mean, it's not like you will do all the rare and the coin easily and quickly, hope the rare fish are not like those from others expansion where they are at 1 on 1000 ;s</div></div><hr />

We haven't covered it yet, but leveling fishing is easier in Legion. You get fish like Graybelly Lobster (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/133735-graybelly-lobster)</div></div><hr />

To be honest, I do like how the Fishing artifact will be rare. Could you imagine if everyone was running around with one, especially with that Undercurrent talent? Fishing pools will be a free for all.</div></div><hr />

I really dont get it why people think critics are objective. I just want you to check some of the recent movies in Rotten Tomatoes. Warcraft has shit critic review, but viewers love it. Other movies have better critic reviews but viewers think they are just average. (I dont want to mention movie titles to not be considered bashing those movies, which I havent seen yet)</div></div><hr />

I honestly think it's just because the cultures are different. Besides, sometimes it would be nice if people listened to film critics more, then people would stop giving Adam Sandler and Michel Bay millions of dollars for their crummy ass movies.<br />
<br />

<br />
There's also a difference between watching a movie to review it and just tuning out to watch the explosions. The Transformers movies are pretty much considered terrible movies by most people and get critically mauled, because they aren't well made. The writing is shit, the plot is crap, the cgi is over designed and busy as well fuck, the cinematography feels like it was filmed from the inside of a washing machine during fight scenes, the jokes are less than juvenile, the acting is bad and there's nowhere near enough focus on the Transformers themselves. <br />
<br />
But they make money hand over fist. I'm a bit of a grumpy bastard when watching films, and what I think of a film /tends/ to line up with that of the critics most of the time. And I can't turn that off, I watch a film and I will be analysing it, I can't help it. Watch a film in &quot;reviewer&quot; mode, and I don't just mean bash it, actually analyse it as you watch it. I still haven't seen it yet, but it seems to be loved by fans, hated by critics. I'm both. So I expect my opinion will fall somewhere in the middle. It's very easy to be blinded by something when you're just so goddamn excited. <br />
<br />
I loved MoS when I saw it in the cinema, but when I watched it on my laptop with my wife without the benefit of a surround sound system and giant screen, I realized how poor it was.</div></div><hr />

But... but... 'splosions and fart jokes are what make us uniquely 'merican. I mean, where would the MCU be without out us throwing our hard earned debt at it.<br />

<br />
Sure it's a grind, but fishing has always been a bit grindy. These pre-req should be heavy enough, that people who don't like fishing are not going to bother; yet achievable enough that the salty folk among us can get it in not too long of a time. <br />
<br />
Making it very easy to get has some big downsides. First of all, everyone will get it because it's easy to get and shiny. Second of all, it will make the fishing profession very shallow.</div></div><hr />

It is scary how much power critics opinions have over the viewing habits of US citizens.<br />
<br />
More people went to see Fantastic Four. I don't think it has to do with critics since critics were shitting on the Batman/Superman movie and people went to see it anyways. It has more to do with the cringeyness of it being a World of Warcraft movie in their eyes. WoW has a stereotype here that it's for greasy losers living in their mom's basement.

Yeah this profession drives people to botting. My last guild one of the guys had two fishing bots going 24/7 and I loved it. Our entire guild had free mats. The guild I'm in currently doesn't have anyone botting, sadly. If they made fishing fun I'd do it. It's aids the way it is now.</div></div><hr />

This exactly. Say what you will about vanilla tbc wotlk etc but they were making the game they wanted to make back then.

I like raiding. I consider the story for this game to be one of the shittiest I've ever seen. I do not read quest text, I skip cutscenes and couldn't care less about the lore. I just like playing the game. The movie looks awful. The dubstep trailers made it look even worse. As I type this I could easily go and get the movie for free on a website and I choose not to. Why would I pay for it? Because I play the game? They already have my money and the only reason they have it is out of plain incompetence from their competition.

As the scale is only to 5 not 100, 5/5 should really indicate somewhere around 80 to 100. Not entirely unexpected on a warcraft website. Was probably a resounding 65 for me.</div></div><hr />

&quot;People are stupid cause they didn't like the movie I liked&quot;.</div></div><hr />

&quot;I put words in peoples' mouths because I am bad at reading comprehension&quot;. There was absolutely no mention of whether I liked the movie or not in my post. Come on back, I can do this all day.</div></div><hr />

It's exactly what you said. Backpedal all you want. Not everyone likes the same things.</div></div><hr />

I threw it in the fountain and its now floating above it like shown above. Only problem is that Nat Pagle DID NOT spawn. Did they deactivate it for now or is this a bug? Wondering if anyone else has done it since the build deployed on the 28th i think it was?<br />
<br />
UPDATE-7/2/16- I logged on after the long &quot;World Server Down&quot; downtime and nat pagle was chasing me around Dalaran with the Fish Frenzy quest ready to go. I was able to complete the quest chain and obtain the Underlight Angler. If you'd like to see the final part of the quest being completed try finding it on youtube or private message me for a link. <br />
Thank you so much for the original post!! I've been wanting to test this since I first caught wind of it.<br />
<br />
At this time it is still incomplete. <br />
<br />
- The AP fish you catch do not yet add any Artifact Power like they are supposed to. <br />
- The &quot;Undercurrent&quot; ability does not seem to be implemented yet.<br />
- Because of the above issues, you are unable to start your trait unlocks or add any AP to the pole. It does not start with 100 like other artifacts. (I'm guessing they are still finalizing/working on the traits.)<br />
- Currently only one appearance option showing at the pearl(forge).<br />
