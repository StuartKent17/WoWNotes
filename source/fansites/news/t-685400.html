<br />
I might add a Cataclysm menu when I'm done with that. (Yes, I do realize that I'm starting to have a lot of menus here. I'm sure I'll eventually figure something out) <br />
<br />
Cataclysm Alpha/Beta Test<br />
Let's start with a small reminder: The Alpha/Beta Test of the expansion didn't start and anything saying otherwise is a scam from people trying to steal your account. Trust me, when an Alpha version of Cataclysm is available, you'll know about it. <br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Release Date<br />
The 2nd most popular question on my list, what's the release date of the expansion? We don't know. The only thing we know at this point is that Cataclysm should be released in 2010 but Blizzard didn't announce the exact date for the moment. Of course it never hurts to <br />
Preorder Cataclysm on Amazon.com (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0HKIU?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochaworofwa-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B002I0HKIU)http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=mmochaworofwa-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B002I0HKIU or anywhere else. <br />
<br />
<br />
Cataclysm - Guild Improvements<br />
Wrath of the Lich King made guilds slightly less useful, a decent PUG can complete a lot of the raid content and finding people to run an heroic dungeon has never been so easy. Cataclysm will change that and make guilds more interesting than ever! <br />
<br />
Guild Levels and Talents<br />
Your guild can now gain experience and levels, the maximum level being 20. Your guild will gain experience through different ways :<br />
<br />
Playing with your guildmates and killing a raid boss or winning an arena match where more than 75% of the group is from your guild.<br />
Playing alone also helps your guild, leveling your character, your professions, or even your reputations will increase the level of your guild as well!<br />
<br />
You won't be able to level fast just by recruiting a hundred of members, guild leveling is restricted and only the top 20 earners each week will increase the experience of the guild. <br />
<br />
Each level will reward you with a guild talent point, they can be spent to make your life easier in the game and will give you bonuses and abilities such as :<br />
<br />
Remove reagent costs from raid buffs. <br />
Reduce the cost of repairs. <br />
Increased gold drops from monsters or players that reward experience or honor.<br />
Summon your entire raid to a place.<br />
Resurrect your entire raid after a wipe. (30 min cooldown)<br />
Reduce the amount of rare reagents needed for professions. (Like reducing the amount of Frozen Orbs to craft a weapon)<br />
Automatically transfer a % of the gold dropped by monsters and bosses to the guild bank. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This is only a small preview of the talents and it already looks like a good reason to stick with your guild, but wait there is more! <br />
<br />
Guild Items and Guild Currency<br />
Guild experience will also be converted in a guild &quot;currency&quot; used to buy special items. These items are bound to the guild and you will have to stay in the guild to keep them, if someone leaves with a guild item it will just be returned to the guild bank. <br />
<br />
You can expect various item rewards from this system:<br />
<br />
Heirlooms<br />
Mounts and pets<br />
Professions Plans (Leaving the guild will unlearn them)<br />
Potions and Rare Reagents<br />
Guild Banners<br />
Guild Bank Tabs and Guild Talents Respecs<br />
<br />

<br />
Guild Achievements<br />
Cataclysm will also add achievements for your guild, the mechanics are the same as guild leveling you will need a minimum ratio of guild members in the group to complete them. They will be very similar to player achievements and you can expect things like :<br />
<br />
Completing a raid instance with your guild<br />
Crafting one (or more!) legendary items<br />
Become a Grand Master in every profession<br />
Become Exalted with all Northrend factions<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Looking for Guild<br />
Cataclysm will also make the management of your guild much easier. A new &quot;Looking for Guild&quot; interface will be added, it will give players an easy way to find a guild and give leaders an easy way to find new members. This new feature will let you recruit people based on a few filters based on various requirements. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/december/gamesystems_005_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/december/gamesystems_005.jpg) http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/december/gamesystems_006_small.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2009/december/gamesystems_006.jpg)<br />
<br />
Improved Guild Interface<br />
Tracking what's going on in your guild will also be made easier with a new interface. <br />
<br />
The Guild News will let you check everything that happened in your guild: boss kills, members achievements, new item loot, profession leveling ... It will come with different filters to let you find specific information.<br />
A new Roster tab will give you more information on your guildmates, you can see the professions of everyone in the guild and even check the list of their recipes to see if they can craft an item.<br />
The calendar will also let you invite other guilds to your guild events.<br />
<br />

Removing Oculus from the random dungeons<br />
There are no plans to remove Oculus from the random dungeon/heroic selection. We know some players have some issues with this dungeon, but everybody I know who has tried it since the 3.3 nerfs has felt that it is a fairly easy dungeon just maybe a bit long. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22050167041-random-dungeon-tool-and-oculus--a-plea.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-death-knight/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?deathknight))<br />
Dual-Wield as a Death Knight<br />
The death knight was always conceived as using both large two-handed weapons and dual-wielding one-handed weapons. The earliest notes we made on death knights had just a few requirements: wears plate, must have a tanking build, uses runes as a resource, controls undead minions, and has two-handed and dual-wielding trees. That has just always been our vision for the class.<br />
<br />
Yes, Arthas uses Frostmourne, but there are also characters like Thassarian who dual-wield. Some players prefer the faster swings of dual-wielding; and from an itemization standpoint it's nice for someone to use one-handed swords besides rogues. There aren't exactly a great number of dual-wielding classes. The rogue class is dedicated to dual-wielding, as is one shaman specialization. That's really it. Hunters rarely use their melee weapons and pretty much go for whatever gives the best stats, which is often the two-handed weapons. Fury warriors use the same two-handed weapons that Arms warriors do.<br />
<br />
We can't always make promises to those who defend a specific play style as their favorite that we'll make sacrifices to keep it viable. With as many players as we have there will always be someone who likes something a certain way and doesn't want to see it changed. There are still shamans out there who picked their class for its (now defunct) tanking niche. Some hunters liked Survival because it was the melee hunter.<br />
<br />
We wanted death knights to dual-wield. Making every tree have a dual-wield build wasn't working. One tree had to become dedicated and we thought Frost made the most sense. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21723849750-2h-frost.html))<br />

Spirit Beast / Wolf pets<br />
I know some of you were reading into my comments a bit much so I'll try and explain things a little more.<br />
<br />
The wolf is overpowered when compared to the other available pets, mostly because it buffs the master. Buffing all of the pets to that level would require a number of different changes to different pets and the chance that one of those buffs would be too much or not enough is reasonably high. When you have say 10 or more things all roughly equal and then one that is outside of that group, the one that’s outside is called an outlier. Defining it as the new normal isn’t smart game design and just like we do with classes, we are likely to nerf the single thing at the top than buff all the others.<br />
<br />
It might not be possible to ever get the pets completely identical (see comments below), so very competitive raiders will probably still only take the best one. But if the best one is only slightly ahead of the others, then it will feel more acceptable to some players to run with the pet they like. For most players, improving their own game will have a larger effect than picking the “best in slot” pet if they are comparable.<br />
<br />
As far as the Spirit Beasts are concerned, there are several reasons why they would make a bad “best” pet. There are not very many options to choose from and all of them require “farming”; a rare spawn that is more of a testament to blind luck than any kind of player skill. As we said before, there is no advantage to having a wider spectrum of pets to choose from if there is only one right choice.<br />
<br />
We have talked about literally making all the pet families identical and letting the player just pick one based on looks. That certainly homogenizes the game quite a bit, which is why we haven’t done it, but it would ultimately allow pet choice to be cosmetic.<br />
<br />
In the end, yes, we do want to get BM competitive with Survival and Marks. We even did some buffs in 3.3 to help them get there but the reason for my comments earlier is that we’d rather have two viable raiding specs than just one so Hunters as a whole are not in terrible shape. Eventually we do plan to get all 3 there. Just remember that when players obsess about 1% differences in dps you can understand why that task is pretty gigantic. There are probably more raiding BM hunters in 3.3 than in 3.2 and probably a lot more than there are Subtlety rogues (sorry for the example rogues, but you/we know it's true). It’s far from a dead spec. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22050165921-any-plans-to-buff-spirit-beasts.html))<br />

Discipline Priest<br />
It's definitely one of the strong points of the Discipline tree to be able to use shields for absorption, but players shouldn't view shields as the answer to every problem encountered. Discipline priests are still priests and have many other spells available to them. The absorbs aren't meant to totally replace the need to heal completely, and one shouldn't compare the amount a Discipline priest can absorb to the amount another healing class (or holy priest) can heal. Power Word: Shield is very powerful, not just due to its absorption effect but also due to the many benefits gained -- primarily through various talents.<br />
<br />
Greater Heal, Flash Heal and even Penance should still be cast as needed.<br />
<br />
In raids, we also think that far too many players want to put the healing classes into two &quot;big buckets&quot; -- tank healers (Holy paladin &amp; Discipline priest), and raid healers (Holy priests, Restoration shaman &amp; druids).<br />
<br />
We simply do not think that's granular enough.<br />
<br />
Discipline priests aren't supposed to be Holy paladins that rely exclusively on their absorptions instead of their heals any more than hunters aren't supposed to be rogues who simply stand at range.<br />
<br />
We think Discipline priests are in a pretty good place at the moment.<br />
<br />
As a side note, one thing we'd like to do is make changes to the game that allow healing meters to be able to properly identify absorptions. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/21724990358-sorry-in-advance-another-disc-priest-thread.html))</div></div><hr />

It's so very easy since 3.3.<br />
Either that, or the brain is playing tricks since hearing about the nerf and thinking it got alot easier even if it didn't.</div></div><hr />

Not that the instance was very hard to begin with, just maybe difficult to learn if you didn't manage to grasp the 3 (three!) abilities of at least one drake type.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't think the problems the difficulty, just people leaving before it even starts. Its already got that stigma around it, and the nerfing hasnt changed those opinions, so imo it should just get removed, otherwise you're forcing people who get it as a random and dont mind doing it to queue for another 30-40 minutes once half the party decides to quit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HolyLiaison</div><div class="date">2009-12-23, 09:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oculus is still annoying. Even after the nerfs certain people STILL have tons problems on the last boss.<br />
<br />
Yes I'm one of those people that leaves as soon as it shows up on my screen. I'll tell you that straight up.<br />
<br />
1) Mounting/Dismounting a ton to clear trash packs that take SECONDS to kill. They need to take a few of those out, possibly all of them.<br />
2) I hate &quot;vehicle&quot; fights. Gimmicks. That's just me though.<br />
3) The last boss is still too &quot;hard&quot; for people that don't know how to use the last two abilities your drakes get after clearing to the last boss. They really need to let the drakes have ALL their abilities from the get go so people can get accustomed to using those two abilities.<br />
<br />
Until then you wont see me in Oculus with a random PuG, sorry. I'll do it with guildies to help with achievements and whatnot, that's about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That makes no sense. So you'd rather patch out an instance than teach other players how to look beyond their own nose?<br />
I often had people with me who said &quot;gawd, oculus ... hate it x(&quot; and stuff, but after we went through the whole instance in about a half an hour they were like &quot;it's kinda cool :)&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it's not possible to patch out the ignorance or obstinacy of some players.<br />

I'm in no way ignorant. When I use the LFG tool I use it to grind out emblems as fast as possible. I don't need to take ages to explain how things work to people that don't know how to do it, I don't have to deal with wiping over and over in an instance I dislike if I don't have to. That's and OPTION I have. Like it or not I'll leave and gladly take my 15 minute penalty and pray I don't get Oculus again.</div></div><hr />

That IS ignorance. You just look for yourself, can't take 2 minutes to explain tactics or abilities and leave a group behind who can wait even longer.<br />

That's and OPTION I have. Like it or not I'll leave and gladly take my 15 minute penalty and pray I don't get Oculus again.<br />
<br />
<br />
It takes &quot;ages&quot; to read the descriptions of 3 skills?</div></div><hr />

I often had people with me who said &quot;gawd, oculus ... hate it x(&quot; and stuff, but after we went through the whole instance in about a half an hour they were like &quot;it's kinda cool :)&quot;.<br />
<br />
Sadly, it's not possible to patch out the ignorance or obstinacy of some players.<br />
<br />
Ignorance wont make it better, and patching everything out will neither.<br />

I LIKE to do Oculus. I don't like having to wait around for a long time extra in lfg because my groups left. Do you see the point? You cant teach people to do that. Theres no incentive for those people to run oculusm as they can achieve the same result in any of the other many heroics.

I fully understand what you mean, but as I said ... you can't just patch something out because &quot;some players&quot; don't like it. Leave it, live with the waiting time if someone leaves and hope that those who leave will experience, how easy this instance really is.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Sure it is, but thats not a real problem, unless a Tank or Healer leaves. There are bunches of damage dealers queued up for a random dungeon and will replace the left one instantly.<br />
<br />
As I said, people need to accept that the oculus is a joke as of today and a very nice and fast instance.<br />
They just need to jump over their shadows. I can understand that oculus was a pain back in the days, but ... look at it now. Seriously.</div></div><hr />

I doesn't matter how many 80s you have, it doesn't matter how many times you went through this instance.<br />
The goal is to success. No matter if you know those people or not, no matter if you watch at it as &quot;PuG&quot; (non-word of the year nominee?). You are not better than them. They might be &quot;noobs&quot;, they might be annoying. But they will end up same as you, leaving everytime they see Oculus.<br />

Sure it might be mean to leave people hanging, but it's also mean when people depend on someone to lead them through the instance holding them by their hand all the way through. It's not hard to figure out, people shouldn't have to hold their hand in HEROIC 5 mans.<br />
<br />
Either way, I never said the people I leave are always bad. I was just bringing up previous experiences I've had PuG'ing the place. I don't even look at the people in my group before I leave Oculus. They could be in full tier 10.5 and I wouldn't care. I just dislike the instance that much. Like I said in my first post my goal is emblems. As fast as possible. The fact I might have to sit around and help people through an annoying instance just turns me off to it completely. I'll take my 15 minute penalty to go do whatever and come back and queue up again once it's passed.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Syrek</div><div class="date">2009-12-23, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While the new guild features are great for raiding guilds in the &quot;standard&quot; sense, some problems arise on servers like mine. <br />
I play on a very small RP server. Raid groups are not guilds per se, they are just raid groups. Meaning, people stay in their own guild and manage the raiding activity through some forums. I know that the situation sounds alien for most people on here, but there's no way our members will leave their own guild, because they play the game from a roleplaying kind of view.<br />
When I see these changes however, I feel that it will be extremely hard to stay competitive with &quot;real guilds&quot; in Cataclysm while using the raid group system.<br />
<br />
One solution to this would be the option to stay in a guild and joining a second &quot;guild-like&quot; raid group. But I doubt that they will go through the troubles of implementing something like that.<br />
<br />
While if they do not, this may very well be the end of competitive raiding on roleplaying servers.</div></div><hr />

Anyway, Occulus is hardly long. It's just infuriating. The average pug does it in under 20mins now from the death of the first boss.<br />

Then Oculus is perfect for you. It's faster than VH since 3.3's nerfs. If speed is your concern, I assume you drop out of HoS, CoS, and UP (muchly due to unavoidable RP/events that force them to take much longer than an Oculus clear), right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wotlk's pve killed 5 good guilds of my server (my guild incuded) which were running Black Temple and doing Illidan before 3.0<br />
<br />
Just because there is no progressive content in wotlk and many old raiders are not interested in hardmode (cause doing the same boss in the same room with 1million more HP an half more damages is so much fun you know ...) it is nearly impossible to keep a good ol' guild alive<br />

Currently there are a few classes which can dual wield...<br />
There are classes who need strength (plate) and classes who need agi/ap (lether+chainmail)<br />
Since fury warriors use 2 two-handed weapons there is no need for stength based one handed weapons cept def and ... Death Knights?<br />
I mean currently DW DKs choose slow weapons with the highest DPS and ignore the stats and Cataclysm is gonna increase the 2 item type (Agi and Str) system...<br />
<br />
I know the hole &quot;Titan's Grip&quot; thing is very consistent with barbar / warrior classes in games but shouldn't DW DKs at least get some weapons designed for them or at least be able to DW 2handed weapons too?<br />
I am not saying &quot;BUFF DK PLZ!!!11 Needz moar dmg lol&quot; I just want fair itemization for the DK class<br />
<br />
Personally I like DW but since there are literally no weapons for it (with proper stats) I prefer a stable twohanded spec</div></div><hr />

IT'S SO EASY. Stop complaining and jump over your shadows, it's annoying how much crying you read about this instance.<br />
They did a well job by tuning it a bit down and let the drakes scale a bit more.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem with occulus isn't that it's difficult. It's boring. Too much mounting/dismounting on the dragons. <br />
<br />
And besides, it doesn't help that it's easy if 3 out of 5 players instantly leaves the group when they see it's occulus (happened to me BOTH times I got occulus yesterday). And since the tank was one of the people who left both times, it means you just sit around and wait.</div></div><hr />

Why not just merge guilds then? The only real reason I hear, for guilds in your situation, is that you have different social groups (or potential officer drama). Why not make a separate channel for each guild, and use guild chat as a kind of public inter-guild-chat?<br />
<br />
I somewhat agree the system is going to cause changes for guild alliances, but even dropping to 50% requirement means if one of your guilds can't fill half the raid, they're going to miss out. And dropping below 50% means mostly-PUGs will get the bonuses, which goes against the whole reason to implement it.<br />
<br />

You have no idea how boring it is to heal the majority of random heroics. If you're even mildly well geared, it's terribly tedious. Only other option is to end up DPSing to use some mana, which is inefficient and just as dull.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My favorite heroics at the launch of WotLK were Halls of Lightning, because Loken was the closest thing to a positioning check, and Oculus, because drakes were the closest thing to a basic ability usage check. Running those two instances with some people from highly progressed guilds taught me just how many &quot;high end raiders&quot; there are who think they're all that but turn out to be morons who only learn their own corner of the game and get lucky enough to find 24 other people who also learn just enough about their own corners of the game to carry each other.</div></div><hr />

See, that bolded spot, thats where I differ.<br />

For me the goal is to have fun. And personally, regardless of how insanely easy Oculus may be, I have never ever had any fun in the instance.<br />
<br />
I don't leave it usually (unless the group is insane fail, I have a limit on repair bills I'm willing to spend for some emblems in an instance I dislike intensly to begin with. I haven't hit that point yet, but am not taking the option off the table) but this in no way in an endorsement of the instance. I wouldn't shed a single tear if it were somehow phased out, and if they gave us the option of opting out of a single Heroic, it would go on my list as fast as could be. Not because of the difficulty, or deciding to help others being a pita, but because I hate the mechanics, gimmics, theme, and everything about the place. And mostly, because I play the game for fun, and have no fun there.</div></div><hr />

Whoa! What a turnaround from vanilla / bc.<br />
<br />
But still, there is a point when no matter how overgreard healer is tank can still die due to GCD. damage dealt, and RNG involved (lag, mob's attack streak, player choosing a &quot;wrong&quot; skill, or just bad positioning)<br />
<br />
Yesterday I died twice in Drak'Taron Keep. Dpser pulled patrol adds, while fighting the other group than I died to due &quot;healer&quot; lag. 2nd death was just really unnecessary as dpser sit down to close to exact this patrol group. After that it was a breeze and fast run. <br />
<br />
If you feel healing is tedious chance spec and try something different. <br />
<br />
About Oculus. It's not hard it just requires to pay attention, which is something no one at lvl. 80 is expecting. <br />
<br />
If you learn your class well, you dont need to pay attention you just click attack sequence mindlessly.</div></div><hr />

Depends why you think its boring. The instance can be done just as quick if not quicker than other instances, so it cant be because of length. <br />
<br />
I dont find any of the hcs interesting anymore due to having run them so many times. I get my enjoyment now from when the tank/healer are gearing up and its a bit more of a struggle. Keeps the mind going rather than just moving to the next aoe pack.<br />

<br />
- Oculus as a whole, despite being faceroll<br />
- CoT4 events<br />
- HoS event<br />
- Anub-Arak being dpsed for literally 2-3 seconds before submerging again.<br />
- HoR with crappy-geared random people<br />
<br />
Oculus is just a horribly designed instance - it already starts with these spread out range drakes which are incredibly annoying to tank. Then you have to fly around with a unfun vehicle that has a 1-button attack while somebody will unintentionally pull some of the trash drakes, despite elaborate flying routes. To add insult to the injury, that happens often when the rest of the party has already dismounted to clear a platform and you can't remount for God's sake because you're already infight. The final boss is also boring and lame, unless you're doing one of the drake's achievements, yet most random people still fail horribly in normal mode.<br />

Let's start with a small reminder: The Alpha/Beta Test of the expansion didn't start and anything saying otherwise is a scam from people trying to steal your account. Trust me, when an Alpha version of Cataclysm is available, you'll know about it. <br />

For connected talents, you usually have to have the previous talents maxed out before you can put points into them.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just because it's a mockup (I doubt it's a display error, as it seems to follow a 3 point talent 4/7/10% progression), but could this reflect a shift in approach to talent setups, either just guild or guild/character, where you don't have to max out a pre-req talent to access connected talents?</div></div><hr />

Yea, a system similar to TF2 assist would be pretty nice, maybe for the top 2 damage dealers and top 1/2 healers for those damage dealers or damaged targets of the killed guy.<br />

<br />
&quot;You can lead a horse to water, but can't make it drink.&quot; fits so well. I'm betting even if the developers gave the players a tactical literal nuke in the instance there'd people that would complain that you would need to aim it. At this point of the expansion's lifespan, where the gimmicks of the instance have been gutted in a informative and literal sense, there really is no excuse to fail at it.<br />
<br />
If you don't know what to do it's your fault for not doing any research/reading the manual. If you complain about others not knowing while knowing yourself then it's your fault for not pointing them in the right direction.<br />
<br />
That being said, this (http://www.wowwiki.com/Oculus) what I used when the instance (http://www.wowhead.com/?zone=4228) was new and actually took a least three people to complete. This (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_sense) also helps.<br />
<br />
All that aside:<br />
<br />
I wonder if this will mean there will be other ways to show guild colours. People have been wanting things like tabards for mounts or flags since forever. It's good to see the old system get a well deserved tune up all the same.</div></div><hr />

- Oculus as a whole, despite being faceroll<br />
- CoT4 events<br />
- HoS event<br />
- Anub-Arak being dpsed for literally 2-3 seconds before submerging again.<br />
<br />
Oculus is just a horribly designed instance - it already starts with these spread out range drakes which are incredibly annoying to tank.<br />
[..]<br />
somebody will unintentionally pull some of the trash drakes<br />
[...]<br />
that happens often when the rest of the party has already dismounted to clear a platform and you can't remount for God's sake because you're already infight. <br />
[...]<br />
yet most random people still fail horribly<br />

<br />
<br />
Well said. I love your list, that's exactly what needs to change about the old heroics to make them more FUN (the whole point of a video game, no?).<br />
<br />
I leave Oculus when I get it. I have 5 level 80 characters, there's no reason for me to suffer through the worst instance that Blizzard has created in a long time.<br />
<br />
What's most annoying about it is grouping with people who haven't done the instance before. Since it is so unpopular (rightfully so), it wouldn't be enjoyable even if I stayed when it comes up. Why? Because no one knows how to use the fucking drakes.<br />
<br />
I got Ruby/Sapphire Void on my main way back when this content was new, and everyone actually had to know what the fuck they were doing, so I don't have a problem now.<br />
<br />
You can't expect ANYONE to use the amber drakes properly now (alternating channels).<br />
<br />
Just get rid of the vehicles and let us use our flying mounts in Oculus and everything would be perfect.</div></div><hr />

We even did some buffs in 3.3 to help them get there but the reason for my comments earlier is that we’d rather have two viable raiding specs than just one so Hunters as a whole are not in terrible shape. Eventually we do plan to get all 3 there. Just remember that when players obsess about 1% differences in dps you can understand why that task is pretty gigantic. There are probably more raiding BM hunters in 3.3 than in 3.2 and probably a lot more than there are Subtlety rogues (sorry for the example rogues, but you/we know it's true). It’s far from a dead spec. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/22050165921-any-plans-to-buff-spirit-beasts.html))<br />
<br />
<br />
Excuse me? Blizzard did nothing for BMs in 3.3, don't lie to our faces like that, everything that was improved was either good for all specs or good for marks/sv, both of which need improving so very much.<br />
<br />
And please don't off-handedly dismiss it with that 1% crap, the difference is simply huge, we're looking at 15-20% in comparable gear versus Marks in a raid setting, I don't appreciate having to go to SV(since it's not as boring as MM) to even do well in a raid.<br />
<br />
Don't lie to our faces, and don't dismiss the concerns, when a spec switch, even in worse gear for SV, can put me in the top 5 and a switch to BM, in excellent BM enchanted/gemmed gear, puts me at...number 15 last time, then it's not a 1% margin and it's insulting to suggest it. <br />
<br />
God, last post they piss all over BM and then when the BM Hunters lash out they lie right to our faces and offer falsities, there's just no hope for this spec with their attitude towards it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone already mentioned that if you aren't in a guild that does everything themselves you get screwed.<br />
<br />
People who help level a guild get kicked or leave because of an issue don't get to keep their guild leveling features. I have left a few guilds after staying for a while because things just get stupid due to how the guild changes mainly due to leadership or I get tired of taking crap from idiots who think they are better just because they are a guild officer or the leader. Even now I get screwed because I can't take stuff in the guild bank with me that I helped get in raids and so forth.<br />
<br />
Guild leveling shows nothing of doing things outside of the game such as prepping for raids, knowing the fights and so forth which are a huge thing with a guild.<br />
<br />
Seriously instantly rezzing a raid after a fight, is it smart enough to do it with players in range of the boss or do we have to run back. This wold have been worth it in BWL and MC, but now there are graveyards right next to the instance entrance and teleporters to get you from point A to B. The only thing this is going to do is make the lazy sobs even lazier. They'll go o man I forgot the rez thing was on CD can you rez me.<br />
<br />
Only good thing about guild leveling is going to be cheaper repairs and no reagents for raid buffs (Seriously just bill me gold when I buff already reagents are one of the things I hate about this game, along with not being able to repair whenever and whereever, just because the game is based on fantasy doesn't mean we can't use technologies potential.)</div></div><hr />

QQ more. The point of a guild is to be a group that stays together and does things together and shares the benefit. You're thinking of it from an individual's point of view and, while that's understandable, the point of guild levels is for the GUILD to benefit. If you leave the guild for you own PERSONAL reasons, why should you keep anything gained through the GUILD?<br />
Also if rezzers really hate rezzing their own guildies that much, then just don't choose the raidwide rez &quot;talent&quot;. I'm sure there are other choices.<br />
<br />
Anywho, I was just wondering if I can assume the guild achievements will be retroactive. Any thoughts? All my professions and secondaries are already at 450 and I'd just like to know that it will count to the guild achievements. If not I'd be rather saddened :(</div></div><hr />

It shows nothing of the sort. I have 6 80s (Mage, Priest, Paladin, Warrior, Warlock, Hunter), with 9 distinct specs. I play all of them quite well. Taking the time to learn them is nothing to me.<br />

I despise vehicle fights. When I play my Mage it is because I am in the mood for a particular playstyle. (repeat prior sentence 8 times for each of the other class/spec combos I play). There is no case where a vehicle fight in any way matches up with what I want to be doing.<br />

I do just fine in vehicle fights. I just do not enjoy it. I will never enjoy it.<br />

I'm liking the new guild changes plus the LFGuild feature which should've been in the game since the start. Right now all we have is trade spam (WE HAVE 4 BANK TABS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO!) or advertising on empty realm forums where the same 3 forum trolls hang out.<br />

Automatically transfer a % of the gold dropped by monsters and bosses to the guild bank.<br />
<br />
You make this sound like a tax. IRC, this only works while in raid/group and it doesn't &quot;transfer&quot; but merely earns for the guild a % of what you earned. You earn 100g in a raid plus the guild bank gets 10% i.e. 10g. You still keep the 100g. Basically, the more you play together the more you earn for the guild bank. Nice bit of encouragement to stay in guild and play together. Too bad in 99% of all guilds, the members just ignore each other and the guild master begs for guild bank donations so he can buy a new mammoth mount. Also, in before made up statistics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm really tired of hearing this excuse, like raiding is the only way your guild can possibly level up. Did you whiners not read the whole description? Or did you just stop at raiding to start raging?<br />
<br />
-Killing Bosses with 75% of the group being your guild.<br />
-Winning arenas with 75% of the group being your guild<br />
-Leveling your Character/Alts<br />
-Leveling professions on your mains/alts<br />
-Gaining rep on your mains/alts<br />
<br />
So, even if you do joint raids with an other guild, that means you just half four other ways to level your guild. Stop complaining, the system will work and it will cater just as much to casuals as the rest of the past two expansions have, sunwell excluded up until the 3.0 patch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry, but I'll be the one to toss the Bullshit flag here...<br />
<br />
The ToC vehicle event lasts for what? 2 minutes tops and is over at the begining of the raid (and most people would be thrilled if they got rid of it, I know my first time in there after they instituted the Random LFG system, I got brought in before they killed the 3 champions but after the mounted fight, I thought they slipped a change in there on us, I was thrilled until they told me a DPS DC'd and I was the replacement.<br />
<br />
As for Ulduar, again, were talking about 1 out of 14 bosses. Less than 10% of the raid... much less actually, takes place in vehicles. And while a bunch of people disl;ike the vehicle part in Ulduar, they deal because it's such a tiny part of the raid.<br />
<br />
Now Oculus... you are on the drakes for a vast majority of the instance. And theres no payoff coolness once your done, just more vehicle crap and some more and some more. Ulduar pays your patience off by being one of the best raids period after your done with FL, and ToC, well, the vehicle part is insanely short at least.</div></div><hr />

So it's not really a &quot;long&quot; instance either.<br />
<br />
Not that the instance was very hard to begin with, just maybe difficult to learn if you didn't manage to grasp the 3 (three!) abilities of at least one drake type.<br />
<br />
<br />
I had a similar group, no one was really informed on how the instance goes, the tank didn't move especially fast, it was just me destroying every pull. We had an issue at one point with a rogue that could not find the third boss, when I said &quot;GO UP&quot; he went down, and vise versa, until I finally had to mount up, fly to the way bottom of the instance, swing my drake around him quickly to grab his attention and drag him to the boss. We still got it.</div></div><hr />

There are no plans to remove Oculus from the random dungeon/heroic selection. We know some players have some issues with this dungeon, but everybody I know who has tried it since the 3.3 nerfs has felt that it is a fairly easy dungeon just maybe a bit long.<br />
<br />
<br />
So Oculus is fine because it's &quot;fairly easy&quot;? How about making it fun? The bosses can commit suicide when I /threaten them, but I still won't run it unless it's a fun instance. In the case of Oculus I hate mounted combat, so I won't be running it no matter how easy and quick they make it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The ToC vehicle event lasts for what? 2 minutes tops and is over at the begining of the raid (and most people would be thrilled if they got rid of it, I know my first time in there after they instituted the Random LFG system, I got brought in before they killed the 3 champions but after the mounted fight, I thought they slipped a change in there on us, I was thrilled until they told me a DPS DC'd and I was the replacement.<br />

lolwut? Vast Majority of the instance...ok. Wait. You fly from the 1st boss to the middle ring (like 30seconds), you fly from the inner Ring to the 3 Platforms outside (again, like 30seconds) and you fly to the 3rd boss (lets say 40second). Oh yea I forgot, you fight the last boss also, which is like 3 minutes. Makes about 6 minutes for me, out of about 25 minutes for the whole instance. Thats the majority, allright.<br />
<br />
Face it: People that dont like OCC or vehicle fights in general are just either too lazy or too stupid to learn like 2 or 3 new abilities (which are self explaining by the help text.) Sadly, I bet it's mostly kind a) people are too lazy. <br />
<br />
Seriously, after 3.3 the EoT Rewards ARE basically FREE Epics already (You can get 20+ badges an hour easily with a decent group). What else do you want?? Oh wait, that are the same players that complain about content being too easy and wellfare epics at the same time. <br />
<br />
See whats wrong here?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The first boss is probably dead within 2 minutes of starting the instance and the time it takes to kill the adds / bosses between dismounting is even shorter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They aren't thinking about how overpowered the Guild Masters are going to be. What says thousands of people don't just start their own guilds now? This is totally going to ruin Guilds. Guilds already ruined WoW as it is, you're not allowed to play World of Warcraft if you can't get into a Guild. Oh, sure... you can Quest and grind meat in the basin or fish, or work on professions, or all that boring crap... but you can't actually do anything fun. You can't raid without a Guild. Have you pugged ICC? Do you even think it'll be possible full clear with random people? This is going to ruin WoW because EVERYONE is gonna create guilds now, GM's are gonna be everywhere.<br />
<br />
After a while, it'll only get worse, where EVERYONE just whores around this ONE guild, and if you're not in it, you're wasting your $15 a month.<br />
<br />
Look at raiding now, you gotta actually SIT OUT for half the raids because there's so many damn people online for raid day.</div></div><hr />

I must've missed something, most of these changes help everyone in the guild. I guess the GM could hoard all the guild items, but I doubt these items will be spectacularly powerful nor is such a GM likely to be able to accumulate many guild credits.<br />

This is an MMORPG. If you want to play alone, there are plenty of single player RPGs out there. It's a simple fact of nature that a team of people who train together for an extended period of time become much more effective at what they're doing than a random group of people. It's also more fun to be a part of a team that works well together. Thus we get guilds.<br />

Yes, I pugged ICC 10 man the first week it was out because I missed my guild's 10 man runs. It went very smoothly. ICC, just like every other raid, is regularly pugged in my low population server. If your server doesn't have pugs to every raid, then there's something seriously wrong with the place. Normal modes are designed to be pugged.<br />

This is not a problem with the game, it's a problem with your guild.</div></div><hr />

I guess maybe for 25man raid content. I have nearly all 10man achievements (well no dedicated insanity:( ) and no two people I raid with are in the same guild (and we are on guilds for social and RP purposes).<br />
<br />
Maintaining a succesful, fun guild is in my opinion the hardest task in Warcraft, far harder than getting all the achievements or being gladiator. Guild masters should get something special imo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know full well how to do the instance. I've done it many, many times across my seven level 80 characters. I just wont do it with random people I don't know. Not after some of the experiences I've had with people in that instance. Never again. Ever.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because it's any different than any of the horrible experiences people have in Azjol-Nerub, Ahn-Kahet, Culling of Stratholme, Halls of Lightning, Forge of Souls, Pit of Saron, Halls of Reflection, etc etc...<br />
<br />
Oh right. No, it isn't.</div></div><hr />
