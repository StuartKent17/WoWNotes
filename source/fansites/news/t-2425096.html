Artifact Knowledge Now In Effect<br />
Artifact Knowledge is now live! Much like in Legion, the amount of artifact power needed for your Heart of Azeroth (https://www.wowdb.com/items/158075-heart-of-azeroth) will begin to decrease week by week. <br />
<br />
<br />
When you log on today, you'll notice that both your current amount of azerite power and the total needed for the next rank has been reduced. <br />
This keeps the percentage that you were at towards your next rank the same while lowering the ceiling for that rank up. <br />
It equals out to be the same reduction as Legion, however, the numbers get smaller instead of larger so that they don't become ridiculous.<br />

Auction House Deposit Changes Now Live<br />
Blizzard has implemented the changes to address single stack materials on the auction house. This is to try and reduce the lag that has been occurring while they work on improvements on the engineering side.<br />
To address some issues related to the Auction House, we’re reconsidering how deposits—the refundable fees you pay to list your auctions—are calculated. This fee is based on the item’s vendor price, and for profession materials in particular, vendors offer very low prices, so these mats have a low deposit cost. Deposits are substantial on items such as BoE uncommon gear, gems, and so forth, but not trade skill materials (trade goods such as cloth, ore, leather, etc.).<br />
<br />
One thing we’ve identified as particularly troublesome is a large volume of trade skill materials being auctioned off in stacks of 1. Some addons make posting quantities of this size trivial to do, resulting in dozens, if not hundreds, of pages of auctions for a single item. As we looked at ways to change this behavior and improve the overall Auction House experience, we found that we prefer to avoid inflexible solutions such as caps on the number of listings a player can make, or increased minimum stack counts, which might interfere with many players' common gameplay habits.<br />
<br />
Our current plan is to increase the deposit cost of some profession materials on a per-stack basis, which should provide incentive for players to post items in larger stacks.<br />
<br />
Here's an example:<br />
<br />
<br />
Let’s say that a player is trying to sell 200 Tidespray Linen for 10g (gold) each. Today, each item has the normal deposit cost of 1c (copper), with a 1s (silver) minimum deposit, so 1 auction of 200 linen requires a deposit of 1s, and 200 auctions of 1 linen each adds up to a total deposit of 2g.<br />
Now imagine an additional 20% deposit added to the listing fee per auction. With an asking price of 10g each, that raises the deposit by 2g per stack. In the case of 1 stack of 200 linen, the total buyout price is 2000g, and the new deposit is 2g1s. In the case of 200 individual stacks, the new deposit of an additional 2g per stack brings the total deposit up to 402g.<br />
<br />
<br />
In either case, the deposit is returned to the seller if the item sells. Successful auctions aren’t affected by this change.<br />
<br />
Our goal is to give players some forewarning on this change, and to gather feedback. We’re putting together a list of the items that would be affected by this deposit change, which we expect to be limited to high-quantity trade goods. Furthermore, we’re deploying the change to the PTR first, so that addon authors can work through the change while we test it thoroughly.<br />
<br />
This change will likely be a temporary measure, as we’re also working to broadly improve the default Auction House in the future. It’s clear to us that many players use addons because they find the default Auction House interface inadequate. A temporary change to deposit fees will help with this in the short term, and we’ll continue to work on overall improvements to the Auction House for a future patch.<br />
<br />

We don't know what the final solution for the AH will be. This is merely a band-aid solution for now.<br />
<br />
And it wouldn't surprise me if it won't be enough to make a difference. The AH lag is quite insane.</div></div><hr />

Rift's AH doesn't have lag mate because barely anyone plays to use it. <br />

They also have less servers for the AH. The core reason is that almost all players only place a single stack of each item they sell, because buyers are intentionally avoiding small stacks, because it is too much of a hassle to buy 30 different auctions if you need 200 of an item.<br />
<br />
The technical details are very simple: if you have to work through a list with 20 items that is much faster than a list with 2000 items.</div></div><hr />

I'm hardly the expert on the auction house, but I'm not so out-of-touch with the game to understand that 400~ gold for 200 stacks of 1 is nothing.

It's a great thing, I hate having to scroll through millions of single items when i'm looking for a stack of 200 of something,.<br />
whoever keeps doing singles need to get strapped to the back of something wild,.<br />
<br />
I hope this puts a quick end to such auctions, severely reduces the total number of individual auctions, and reduces lag.</div></div><hr />

ya, well obviously it will be more profitable to sell larger stacks. however, I think a better fix is to have a minimum stack size for crafting materials ... like 5 or 10.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1/1000 to next level = about 10 AP items at 100 ap piece<br />
999/1000 to next level = 1 ap item at 100 to next level<br />
<br />
after today<br />
<br />
1/770 to next level = about 8 at 100<br />
769/770 to next level = 1 to next level<br />
<br />
It changes nothing but lower the amount you need to level. If you were 62% yesterday you will be 62% today but you will need around 30% less ap to level.</div></div><hr />

I know how it works... and what you said is exactly why its stupid. You LOSE AP you already collected, that is the issue. You drop from 999 to 769, that is a loss of 230 AP. It doesnt matter how much you need till next level, you lose what you already collected. <br />
<br />
If you didnt collect those 998 and waited till change, you would be getting 1 more level and 230 into next level, but now because you collected before, you still dont have level and you &quot;lost&quot; those WQs or missions or whatever you did to get it and cant do it again. That is extremely stupid way of doing things.<br />
<br />
There is no reasonable explanation for it either. Just lower the limit for level and level the neck and give us 230 into next level. Why is that an issue? It is literally punishing people who did stuff and couldnt get to the cap before, and rewards those that didnt do anything and waited. So damn stupid</div></div><hr />

You had to do something to get that 230AP... You lose mission, WQ, island expedition run or whatever... or if nothing else, time and effort. If you saved that time you wasted and did it after reset, you are getting level and then some! Yay, great system!!<br />
So yes, you are losing AP and time. It is quite obvious too. <br />

That was always the case with AK catchup, even in Legion. With the old system in Legion, you would get less AP today then you would next week for the same time investment. Thats just how catchup works. Now the system is just inverted, but its the exact same end-result.</div></div><hr />

No you're not because Tuesday is the reset day which is also the same day they apply the catchup. So you can't save those WQ's, expeditions, etc because you're losing out by not doing them prior to the reset. <br />
<br />
I was at 6962/22500 I believe and now i'm 6962/17538. <br />
<br />
If I was at 21000/22500 it wouldn't matter either because I'd still be 1-2 quests away from capping but my next Artifact level would require less as well.</div></div><hr />

Gotcha. So then my original would be the following then since the 6962 was my reduced number. After referencing the exact total for level 19 before the patch it was 22800 and not 22500.<br />
<br />
8911 / 22800 - 13889 to level.<br />
6962 / 17538 - 10576 to level. (After reduction)<br />

<br />
<br />
Thats not how it works... both missions and WQs. They dont reset on reset day. You dont have to clear them before reset either.<br />
<br />
I understand. But the amount required for the next level is still less than before regardless of whether our total AP is reduced. Look at my exact example above here. Are you going to hoard missions and wq's before each Tuesday reset so you can get a tiny edge? <br />
<br />
I'm 39% percent to my next level in both situations but now the last 61% only takes 10.5k to finish versus 13.8k.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Forget the numbers - they represent a fraction - your percent to goal. If AP were cumulative this would have mattered (as in level two requires level 1+ X). <br />
<br />
But each level is independent of each other. So by maintaining the same 62%, you’ve lost nothing. So think of it as “how much percentage did I work for”-</div></div><hr />

there is generally a weekly benchmark where players will be with 1-2 lvls of each other.<br />
<br />
I assume most people are around the 16-17 mark at the moment?</div></div><hr />

As for the ap change, its literally the exact legion system but inverted. Its always worth getting ap every week, but these early levels will matter less and less as each week goes by. I get that losing ap &quot;sounds&quot; counterintuitive but its much better to keep all the numbers sensible than the crazy that was legion with billions of ap.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TLH</div><div class="date">2018-08-29, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The big help to the AH is to change the UI, let people search based on &quot;minimum stack size&quot;<br />
<br />
So instead of seeing wave after wave of single sheets of tidespray linen, I can go right to stacks of 100 or more, or 200 if I so chose.<br />
<br />
<br />
This would encourage AH listers to stop listing single items at a time that most people would prefer not buying for large stack items like cloth. Is it so hard to just update the AH UI? This is the simplest fix in the world, why is this not already implemented?</div></div><hr />

<br />
More detailed math for people who like mathy math math.<br />
<br />
Assumed values for simplicity:<br />
AP per WQ = 50<br />
Rank 1 is 2000 AP<br />
Rank 2 is 3000 AP<br />
<br />
5 players here, player A, B, C, D, E to cover various points of a level.<br />
<br />
Player A - rank 1 at 100/2000 (5%)<br />
<br />
Player B - rank 1 at 1000/2000 (50%)<br />
<br />
Player C - rank 1 at 1500/2000 (75%)<br />
<br />
Player D - rank 1 at 1900/2000 (95%)<br />
<br />
Player E - rank 2 at 50/3000 (1.7%)<br />
<br />
Ok, so based on this here is how many WQ to level. <br />
<br />
Player A - 38 WQ<br />
Player B - 20 WQ<br />
Player C - 10 WQ<br />
Player D - 2 WQ<br />
Player E - 59 WQ (to rank 3)<br />
<br />
Today we have a 23% earned and needed AP compression. New values are:<br />
<br />
Player A - 77/1540 (5%) and needs 29.3 WQ to level (23% reduction in WQ).<br />
<br />
Player B - 770/1540 (50%) and needs 15.4 WQ to level (23% reduction in WQ).<br />
<br />
Player C - 1155/1540 (75%) and needs 7.7 WQ to level (23% reduction in WQ).<br />
<br />
Player D - 1463/1540 (95%) and needs 1.5 WQ to level (23% reduction in WQ).<br />
<br />
Player E - 39/2310 (1.7%) and needs 45.4 WQ to level (23% reduction).<br />
<br />
If you notice all spectrums had their effort needed to level reduced by 23%.<br />
<br />
Now, let's see what happens if you scale only required AP by 23% and leave earned AP alone:<br />
<br />
Player A - 100/1540 (6.5%) and needs 28.8 WQ to level (24% reduction)<br />
<br />
Player B - 1000/1540 (65%) and needs 10.8 WQ to level (46% reduction).<br />
<br />
Player C - 1500/1540 (97%) and needs 1 WQ to level (92% reduction).<br />
<br />
Player D - 360/2310 (jumped to rank 2 and now 15% into rank 3) with 39 WQ to level again.<br />
<br />
Player E - 50/2310 (2%) and 45.2 WQ to level (23.4% reduction).<br />
<br />
As you can see in this case the effect on leveling is heavily based on your current level within a rank. It is very advantageous to be close to a rank without going over. Player D here after reset would be a head of Player E which doesn't really make a lot of sense.<br />
<br />
Of course if you do not like catch up mechanicism than you aren't going to like this or the Legion system which was mathematically the same.</div></div><hr />

So if I put in 200 of 'Flower' but I only need 3, I buy 3 and the remaining 197 are still up for sale. Then no one has the need to put in stacks of 1, all problems solved.&quot;<br />

And that entirely sucks.<br />
<br />
For the AH, they should just allow you to sell stacks depending on what you physically have in your bags. Want to sell 2000 stacks of 1 ? Gotta split them manually in your bags before.</div></div><hr />

Sort of for holding emissaries. It depends on if you are consistently doing them or not.<br />
<br />
You can only turn in 7 emissaries per week as only 1 spawn per day if you are doing them consistently. You get a 2 day bonus week 1 and after that its the same.<br />
<br />
Example:<br />
<br />
AK (or azerite squish) goes into effect every Tuesday.<br />
<br />
Week 1 we only turn in Tues-Sat (5) and save Sunday &amp; Monday. This is our &quot;bonus&quot;.<br />
<br />
Week 2 we turn in 3 on Tuesday (bam phat AP), but we know in week 3 get another squish so we hold Sunday and Monday again. So we turned in 7 this week (Sun - Sat).<br />
<br />
Week 3 we turn in 3 on Tuesday again (more phat AP), but we know in week 4 we get another squish so we hold Sunday and Monday again. So we turned in 7 this week again.<br />
<br />
Repeat. You get 7 turn ins per squish level. You get a bump of +2 in the first week.<br />
<br />
Another person just does them daily. He missed out on the +2 bump the first week, but since then he also turns in exactly 7 emissaries per week. Technically every Tuesday he's a little behind, but we're talking small amounts here.<br />
<br />
Now if you only sporadically do your emissaries, and you happen to be doing them on Sunday/Monday then yeah you can squeeze a little extra oomph out of it. Is it a big deal? Maybe, I don't think so but others might. The key is it isn't a compounding gain every week by holding your emissaries.</div></div><hr />

I really doubted they would do that. Reducing how much is needed AND what you already collected, so we actually lose AP? Haha<br />
If you are at 0 AP, you lose nothing, if you are at 99%, you lose as much as they reduce how much is needed. Im sorry, i actually collected that AP, so why are you removing it? Bloody idiots, whoever made that decision.<br />
<br />
lol math is hard for some I guess. Yo lose NOTHING you're at the exact same percentage of the next rank as you were yesterday, and now you need LESS azerite to complete that level than you did yesterday</div></div><hr />

You have the numbers, if you save two emissaries and all the wq's that wont expire before the daily reset you get something around 400-600 extra ap. That's 3 islands. Is it worth it? Its meaningless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In Legion, AP items you hadn't consumed didn't get updated with new numbers. I had piles of them in the mail from doing order hall missions on the phone, and after the catch-up mechanism they weren't giving 1.2 million. They were still all giving 125. <br />
<br />
I think they did this wrong, though. They should have just kept numeric amounts and moved the goalposts, awarding extra level(s) as necessary. It's a difference between:<br />
<br />
&quot;everyone still has exactly the amount of power they earned&quot; vs. &quot;everyone still has exactly the percentage of level they happened to be at before&quot;.<br />

The first one feels better to players than the second, I think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
regarding the AP discussion. The default UI does a good job on actually hiding your AP totals. Yes you can mouse over the &quot;golden&quot; Bar and see the numbers in the tooltip, but the %-Values are displayed properly. <br />
<br />
After login, the reduction will change nothing. You'll see the same percentage as before. This is also a very good solution, since players have to actively collect AP to progress. Just staying logged out for weeks will not change your AP level at all, although completing 1 WQ might then be good to reward you with several AP levels later in the expansion progress.<br />
<br />
What actually changes is the percentage of AP that a WQ offers towards you next level. If you weren't shown absolute numbers on the world map but %-Values those would be growing after the weekly reset. <br />
<br />
I see no issues with the solution. The actual (absolute) amount of AP that you have collected means absolutely nothing. It's just grinding towards each level up.<br />
<br />

<br />
Except you can't not scale earned AP unless you want to cause problems.<br />
<br />
Read my example on page 2 of what happens when you decrease earned and required versus just required at 5 different locations along a given rank.<br />
<br />
That is, unless you want a system where you can log off at 90% of rank 4 and log in ahead of a guy that logged out at 10% of rank 5.</div></div><hr />

The core reason is that almost all players only place a single stack of each item they sell, because buyers are intentionally avoiding small stacks, because it is too much of a hassle to buy 30 different auctions if you need 200 of an item.<br />
<br />
The technical details are very simple: if you have to work through a list with 20 items that is much faster than a list with 2000 items.<br />
<br />
It's also sligthly because so many sources push ppl doing auctioning towards tsm addon and if you don't configure tsm the default is a stacks of 1</div></div><hr />
