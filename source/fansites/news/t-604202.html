Rogues - Hemorrhage changes in 2.3.2<br />
I talked about this a few weeks (months?) ago during the 2.3.2 testing but it's great to have a post explaining everything for people who didn't read the original posts about this. <br />
Hemo should be doing less damage in 2.3.2 than in 2.3.0.<br />
<br />
Hemorrhage is also normalized based on weapon type and speed so the amount of damage you do with an individual attack will vary depending on the type and speed of the weapon you are using and can not be directly compared to your main hand attacks.<br />
<br />

World of Warcraft wins an Emmy Award<br />
Blizzard won an award during the 59th Technology &amp; Engineering Emmy Awards held during the CES in Las Vegas this week under the category &quot;Development of Massively Multiplayer Online Graphical Role Playing Games&quot;. <br />
<br />
According to the Emmy Awards (http://www.emmyonline.org/mediacenter/tech_2k7_winners.html) website, 2 other games won this award : Everquest and Neverwinter Nights. I'm not sure if NWN and EQ won an award for the original game, or for the follow-ups, it seems a bit late to give an award to the original Everquest game even if it definitely deserves an award.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anarki</div><div class="date">2008-01-10, 10:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As I heard, its NWN that released at 1991, so its not that late for EQ to get award :P</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sildani</div><div class="date">2008-01-10, 11:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hortus confuses me. My understanding is that normalized attacks for rogues use a pre-set weapon speed depending on weapon type, whereas non-normalized attacks used the weapon speed. One of the reasons I respec'd Hemo in 2.3.0 was because Hemo was changed to be a normalized attack, making it viable again considering the lack of slow (2.80 or greater) speed one handers. But he implies normalized attacks depend on weapon speed???</div></div><hr />

1) when you click Source it link you to mmo-champion.com and not to the source :P<br />

2) Mazrigos server do not exist<br />
