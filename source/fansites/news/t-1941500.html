They'll probably be at 21xxx internally by early next week, if not the end of this week. I doubt it'll have much to do with when beta goes live :)</div></div><hr />

Is Correct - it is clearly still on the mini map, but just moved underneath other areas - could of been a bug, or accident.<br />

I agree it will just be a content patch down the road as the end tier of raiding / content.</div></div><hr />

Thal'Dranath, is gone... well, guess it got Faralorn'd, no big suprise realy.<br />
<br />
As for saying it'll be a patch, that's what they said about Faralorn too &gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
So, i'll believe it when it's in game.<br />
<br />
incorrect they said they want to add it but it may not...<br />

faralorn was never promised</div></div><hr />

Not to mention, compared to Faralorn Thal'Dranath actually DID receive &quot;some&quot; minor updates. Mostly the ocean around it though. As far as I remember, the stuff on Faralorn was already on it when Alpha started and was never touched afterwards. <br />
I feel like them removing it after making sure it fits in that place means they're working on it separately. Even Blizzard knows that cutting content they show (especially after claiming they will only show guaranteed content during presentations like Gamescon and Blizzcon) is extremely risky and dangerous for their business model right now.</div></div><hr />

ummm hate to brake it to u fanboy, but yeah it was at blizzcon. People running to blizzards defence blinding making information up is a bad joke. Just sad blizzard does this every X-pack, and every X-pack we have the same fanboys coming to back blizzard saying its not going to happen... How many times does a child need to be burned before it learns not to put its fingers on the stove.... seeing this fan page, they will never learn.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well Survival hunters have nothing of magic, so that could work, also... i think the fire dealing magic is only for tanks<br />
<br />
Note: You could see it as part of your weapon and not magic per se, like its comming out from any of this shields<br />

No, they didn't move it farther out, they literally hid it UNDER the map.<br />
