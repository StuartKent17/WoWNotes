Patch 7.3.5 Hotfixes - February 20<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
https://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/warlock) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#k) / Artifact Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#lAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#k))<br />
<br />
Fixed a bug that allowed Demonic Gateways to be placed in unintended spots.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Halls<br />
<br />
Argus missions that award Blood of Sargeras (http://www.wowdb.com/items/124124-blood-of-sargeras) now cost 600 more Order Hall Resources. This will not be correctly reflected in the Legion Companion App until its next version update.<br />
<br />
Developers’ notes: Completing these missions with bonus rewards previously returned more Order Hall Resources than they cost. Rather than reduce their yield, we’ve increased the cost of the missions so that players with ample Order Hall Resources can convert them to tradeskill materials.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Pit of Saron<br />
<br />
The health of most enemies in Pit of Saron has been reduced by 50% in Timewalking.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
If you have all Legion Legendary items for your class, consuming a class-specific item that generates a Legion Legendary item will now always generate a token for another class.<br />
Heritage of the Ren'dorei now contains the Ren'dorei Cloak.<br />
<br />
<br />
NPCs<br />
<br />
Hatecoil Spitespeaker should no longer instantly respawn.<br />
Princess Poobah should no longer unexpectedly stop offering quests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
&quot;The Emerald Dreamcatcher&quot; is no longer weekly.<br />
The starting location for &quot;Teldrassil: The Burden of the Kaldorei&quot; should now correctly be displayed on the map.<br />
Mature Silkwing again have a chance to softly drop Iridescent Wings for “The Softest Wings”.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Loot Rules for Transmog Runs<br />
Since the Patch 7.3.5 change to use personal loot rules in leveling dungeons, we’ve heard a lot of feedback from Transmog hunters concerned about how this has affected the ability to collect appearances from older content. We hear you, and agree it’s a problem, so we’ve been working on a more robust solution for Battle for Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Once these updates are implemented, entering a dungeon or raid that is trivial for you (i.e.: your character is 10 or more levels higher than the dungeon or raid’s intended level) will activate a “legacy loot mode.” That loot mode will work like this:<br />
<br />
<br />
The number of items dropped by bosses will be the same as it would have been if you were in a full party. So if you’re in a 5-player dungeon, you’ll get 5 players’ worth of loot.<br />
For raids with a flexible raid size (such as Raid Finder), this will act as though there were 20 players in the raid.<br />
All items on the loot table will have a chance to drop, not just the ones that are designated for your spec.<br />
If you have multiple players in the group, the loot will be split among those players, but be tradeable. For example, if you’re clearing with one other player and kill a boss that should drop 4 items, you’ll each be able to pick up two items and trade them between each other if you like.<br />
<br />
While the personal loot change was a key part of what allowed us to expand leveling dungeons to encompass a wider range of levels, and we’re happy with it in that environment, we recognize that it’s not a great experience for those who enjoy clearing older content for transmog, and hope that these changes will make that more enjoyable once they’re complete. <br />
<br />
Thanks again for all of the feedback!<br />

WoW MVP Program - Recruitment Now Open!<br />
Hey all!<br />
<br />
As we announced last week, we are making some changes to the World of Warcraft MVP Program for North America. With this, one of the biggest changes is going to be in how we recruit our MVPs. <br />
<br />
Going forward, we will be using an application-based recruitment system, which will allow us to ask targeted questions to candidates, as well as close and open recruitment as needed within a given period.<br />
<br />
Today we will be opening our first recruitment period in 2018. You can find a link to the application here.<br />
<br />
Please answer any discussion prompts thoroughly, and, if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to ask us here. We look forward to reviewing applications over the next few weeks and we wish all of you applying the best of luck!<br />
<br />
NOTE: The World of Warcraft North American MVP Program is only open to applicants from the North American service region including the United States and Canada. Applicants from Oceania and South America, including Mexico, will need to refer to their specific MVP Programs where applicable. Any applicants from outside the designated regions will be discarded.<br />
<br />
&gt; &quot;Should You happen to strongly disagree with a Blizzard poster or another MVP over a topic on the forums, the discussion is best handled in private.&quot;<br />
<br />
What is meant by &quot;strongly&quot; in this context? Is it an implication that it may threaten your ability to discuss it in a purely constructive manner or are you actually suggesting that if MVPs are particularly concerned about an issue that they should go directly to Blizzard rather than post it publicly, as any other forum poster would?<br />
<br />
Additionally, if I fill out half of this application and don't submit it, is any record of it kept? I do not wish to apply. I simply want to see what all is in the application.<br />
As an FYI, that wording is from our original MVP Program legalese, and hasn't been changed for this recruitment period.<br />
<br />
In this context, I think it lends that we expect that our MVPs will be passionate posters on a variety of topics. Sometimes, its easy to see that what one may post in those kinds of discussions could disrupt your ability to be a constructive member of the community, as required by the program. We would advise that our MVPs should message those disagreements with other MVPs or CMs to us privately so we can try to resolve them without any breach of the program terms that may lead to forum tirades, etc. The forums aren't a place for drama between CMs, MVPs, posters, or otherwise.<br />
<br />
The final page of the application will automatically submit the form once you see the screen that notes it has been submitted, yes. The last page with form content is the one with the section asking for a response to a post on a variety of listed community issues. You should be able to go through it up to that question to view what is being asked.<br />
<br />
If you'd like us to remove any form content you may have submitted, you can shoot me an email with the basic information you applied with such as your name and battle.net email.<br />
<br />
Instead of having paid moderators blizz is going to recruit ppl to work for free, nice<br />
I was going to just delete this, but I wanted to point a few things out because I've seen it elsewhere:<br />
<br />
The MVP Program has been a part of the WoW Community for over ten years. In that time, we've had wonderful community volunteers who have worked to help players both on the forums and throughout our community, and I don't see that changing any time soon. Our MVP volunteers will continue to be passionate and dedicated WoW community members who will continue to do the work they've done for a decade.<br />
<br />
Blizzard also employs wonderful folks in Community and Customer Support who handle a ton of stuff on you never see in the day-to-day who deserve credit regardless of if you see their work in action or not.<br />
<br />
Our MVPs do *NOT* have any powers on the forums that our Moderators or Community Managers have, and just to clarify, having green text gives no forum ability besides... having green text.<br />
<br />
So I get that Blizzard has a large number of paid employees we never see who do a lot for the community, and I also get the the WoW MVP role has been around for awhile so it's not like this is some new ground breaking thing. But what I don't get is how does any of this address the point of view that this is Blizzard recruiting people for a job they should be paid for and asking them to do it for free?We aren't recruiting anyone for a &quot;job&quot; here. The MVP program is a volunteer community effort for regular forum posters. We are simply opening entry into that program to a wider audience by having a recruitment application.<br />
<br />
The MVP Program recognizes our passionate and constructive posters and asks them to continue contributing to the community, while giving them an avenue to discuss issues with us when needed. This does not change the nature of their usual discourse on the forums, and is mainly targeted at those posters who already devote a lot of time here by their own will.<br />
<br />
MVPs do not moderate, facilitate any major amount of feedback past what they do voluntarily, build reports of any kind, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
Xavius - Warlock Solo Kill<br />

<br />
Because the missions yielded so much per resource cost that it effectively created an infinite supply of resources through trade ins, that negated having to do WQs for more. It was working quite well for alts that never had to leave order hall/dalaran and could generate thousands of gold per day.</div></div><hr />

The point of the initial changes was to allow for dungeon scaling across a wide range of levels, and personal loot accomplishes that on the loot side. Group loot would require another layer of scaling added (basically for the same piece of loot to appear at different item levels for each player viewing it, much like heirlooms).

<br />
<br />
but blood of sargeras is worth fuck all since you get a bunch from mythics... why the fuck are they increasing the cost of it<br />
<br />
Totally agree, no reason to do them any more</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was wondering why those missions cost so much :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Don't worry about it cause he got no idea. It's been 1800 order hall resources for 12 blood in case you used 3 of your followers(which pretty much limits the amount of other missions you can do). You had about 1 of those missions per day. You had to spend 9(or more if you didn't use three followers) of those blood back into resources to self sustain the mission. So you had 3 blood left for other stuff(if you played the mission with double cost or something like that you actually had a huge loss instead of a gain. So you always needed the right follower for it.). You can do the math yourself of how much gold you can make out of best case 3 blood of sargeras per day on your server(on mine it's like 300. So less than many WQs etc.)...but I can tell you that the 2k gold mission for very little resources is much, much, much better and with the right perks you do not need to leave the home station either cause you just auto finish certain order hall resource WQs.<br />
Don't get me wrong, it's been one of the better missions around...but that's just cause most other missions are not worth it anymore at this point. Artifacts are all powered up. We got most of the reputation cache mounts/toys/pets. Veiled argunite is useless cause ilvl is already too high. Rune buffs are cheap already and followers are quite maxed out(the chance for a legendary is not really worth it). Primal sargerite yields you up to 1250 gold if you trade it for empyrium and sell it in the AH....all that for 200-300 order hall resources. So in terms of making lots of gold, the gold mission and primal sargerite are much better than blood of sargeras. The only real advantage of blood of sargeras was that it was more than selfsustaining. Now it's quite useless(you are better off doing primal sargerite and then buying in AH whatever you would have bought for blood of sargeras. You get like 1200-1300 gold for both...but one costs 2400 and the other 200 order hall resources...quite a huge difference. 12 times as many resource WQ's for the same amount of gold.).<br />
Given how expensive the krokul followers are, order hall resources are a problem for any char that isn't running a bunch of resource WQ's every single day. So you are not going to spend those resources on some stupid 1to1 exchange mission...and Blizz could as well have done their other plan or right away disabled that mission. It's all the same in my book. The mission is dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think that change happened due to two things: <br />
-First of all cause it may be that Blizz isn't capable of controlling some chinese server farms using 50 maxed out char accounts and autoscripts for farming those missions(congrats Blizz, you let them force you to make your game play worse again). Tho I ain't sure if it's really worth it...given that you gain 15000/day per account(with 50 maxed out chars)...and you need to pay around 300k for the monthly account token(by my server standards). So you net around 150k gold per month. That's around 5€ worth. You still need to buy the account, invest in levelling up, hardware and electricity. You'd need years before even reaching break even. in europe it definitely wouldn't be worth it.<br />
-And to force players to spend time on flying around for brainless order hall resource WQs(yay, that's content we ALL LOVE! NOT!).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dembai</div><div class="date">2018-02-21, 07:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Welcome loot changes, but still slightly missing the mark for me. &quot;If you have multiple players in the group, the loot will be split among those players, but be tradeable.&quot; Why? Just make it how it was. Stop forcing personal loot down our throats at every turn.<br />
Another thing that would be nice is if they'd just revert the changes and put the old system in place. Then we wouldn't have to wait until the expansion for them to implement a new system. The old one wasn't broken.<br />
<br />
Not all of it was personal loot. Only from Dragonsoul on. This will allow more drops to happen where drops were actually NOT HAPPENING AT ALL...because there was a very solid chance to just roll &quot;gold&quot; every time.<br />
<br />
Guaranteeing two drops per player, plus trades is an improvement to the system, and makes it similar to all older raids (roughly, 4 pieces is less than what you get out of a 25man raid).<br />
<br />
I'm personally okay with this change, it will make getting gear out of these raids much easier (for the most part, though there were a FEW adventages to personal loot for certain bosses/class combos). on the whole, one will get more gear from Dragonsoul and newer raids!<br />
<br />

<br />
Let me add my voice to the level of stupidity that is making bloods cost 600 resources. I'd rather blow resources on things that BENEFIT me, especially since I'm doing LESS world quests as of right now and my resource generation is actually LOW. This was a stupid change, and considering half the time I have 2-3 blood quests, 1-2 epic quests that take too long for too little benefit, gearing-up quests that I don't need anymore, the ONLY quests I can really do are AP/gold/rep quests (and let's face it, we're all exalted with most of those reps at this point).<br />
<br />
And that...sucks. At least bloods were giving me something to do with my crafting which I haven't touched since Nighthold because there was no point.</div></div><hr />

Even if it's not personal loot anymore, 5 players worth of loot is so much better then 0-1 item... wow, thanks Blizz.<br />
<br />
I already suggested a &quot;solo loot mode&quot; , and now they figured it out, when 10 levels higher then the dungeon/raid.</div></div><hr />

Because people like me would upload pictures of their dick. Other people (lots of people) would upload copyrighted artwork without the rights to it. Blizzard might want to avoid any legal hassle dealing with that if artists start complaining.</div></div><hr />

It's not really taking anything away from the game, just reducing the mog running a little</div></div><hr />

Uhm.. You know.. The avatar system is almost as old as the internet. And platforms like Steam allow the upload of avatars and don't seem to have any problem at all with the things you mentioned.</div></div><hr />

Making it too easy to find transmogs = transmogs lose its value = less time needed to find transmogs = one less reason to play the game.<br />

Or is the new and fresh &quot;legacy loot mode&quot; just the old &quot;group loot&quot; setting?</div></div><hr />

It's the old group loot setting. you don't have to wave your cane around and tell the kids to get off your lawn just yet.</div></div><hr />
