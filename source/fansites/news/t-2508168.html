It’s on all other consoles so why not on the Switch?<br />
<br />
It’ll probably sell extremely well too.</div></div><hr />

Agreed its odd why they choose to wait so long, perhaps still worth milking that little bit more out of it before overwatch 2 hits. :) Can still see it doing well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suspect, with the success of Classic, that Blizzard will revisit their stance on flying and make it available sooner in future patches. While Classic did not have flying... people left it because they changed so much. For those that loved flying changing how it was earned it drove a lot of people away.<br />
<br />
Maybe they will... maybe they won't. As long as they get by with marketing it without having to give it until it's usefulness as a gating mechanism has passed.... maybe they'll just status quo it.</div></div><hr />

Flying was perfect in BC. Seemed pointless in Legion so I skipped it in BFA.<br />
<br />
Classic has no flying, but the mounts are great!</div></div><hr />

Soo, image for &quot;Battlechest&quot; and PTR versions of WoW with flying mount somehow means that they'll add flying to Classic, via cash shop (of course). I knew comments in news section are stupid, but have some limits. And if you're trolling, be at least funny one.</div></div><hr />

I am pretty sure you are way overthinking it. I doubt that picture has anything to do with flying mounts. Sorry to burst your &quot;have to include classic in everything&quot; bubble.</div></div><hr />

What are you talking about? One of the most famous (and iconic) artworks of WoW is from vanilla and it's a dwarf flying on a gryphon. This is almost a callback of sorts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed it's iconic. And what differentiated WoW from other MMOs. And in WoD they tried to completely remove it from, the game. The result? So may people unsubbed that they reversed their decision. Then released pathfinder system to time gate flying until after it's of no relevance to the game.<br />
<br />
And here they are using flying again as a draw... there are PLENTY of iconic images in WoW history. Let's hope this is a tease to what 9.0 brings.. flight right away and content actually designed with it in mind.. maybe even flight based combat.</div></div><hr />

It's so cringy to see people thinking Blizzard would actually add flying to Classic, where they are keeping so many inconveniences just to have it closer to the real experience.<br />

Blizzard doesn't &quot;underthink&quot; anything. They choose their images carefully and with reason. I suggest we just wait and we'll see what Blizz has in store for flying.</div></div><hr />
