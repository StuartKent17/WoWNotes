Some people respect NDAs. The reasons may not be clear to you, but game shops don't make alpha/beta testers sign NDAs just because their lawyers are bored.</div></div><hr />

Epic Fail.<br />
<br />
Running beta.worldofwarcraft.com through domaintools.com comes up with :<br />
IP Location of : &quot;California - Long Beach - Blizzard Entertainment&quot; <br />
&amp; a registrant of :<br />
<br />
&quot;Blizzard Entertainment<br />
P.O. Box 18979<br />
Irvine, California 92623<br />
United States&quot;<br />
<br />
So blizzard have registed the domain name of &quot;worldofwarcrarft.com&quot; of which<br />
&quot;beta.worlofwarcraft.com&quot; is a subdomain of. There isnt any way for a keylogger site<br />
to somehow get a domain name of &quot;beta.worlofwarcraft.com&quot; when &quot;www.worldofwarcraft.com&quot;<br />
is registered to Blizzard Entertainment. Since <br />
<br />
If you click the &quot;Download Client&quot; URL you get a page that begins with<br />
&quot;https://www.worldofwarcraft.com .... ETC&quot; so its one that gets you to logon your <br />
acct management. That link for &quot;beta.worldofwarcraft.com&quot; uses a secure link of &quot;https://&quot;<br />
<br />
In Firebox if you go Tools-&gt;Page Info and then go to the &quot;Security&quot; tab you will see it has a certificate from &quot;Thawte Consulting cc&quot; with an owner of &quot;Blizzard Entertainment&quot;. Not only that but they are using High Grade Encryption , AES 256 bit encryption so your personal information is being encrypted before being sent. On furthar investigation it would show that Blizzard went for the Premium SuperCert certificate in August 2007 which would of cost them US$ 1,199.00 and is Thawte consulting's strongest encryption and certification avaliable<br />
<br />
Before going for the Kneejerk reaction maybe you should fully investigate something before posting the first thing that goes through your mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing definite being leaked from the Alpha yet . The only thing those patch notes had on them was a listing of things open to test , where the public transportation to Northend is leaving from and a confirmation of what level your death knight starts out at . Pretty skint on details so far.<br />
<br />
The stuff on having to do a quest to unlock a death knight is direct from Blizzard - do some searchs for it and you should have no trouble finding it</div></div><hr />

It's interesting if you use Firefox to take a look at the security certificate for that site <br />
<br />
It comes back as Owned by Blizzard Entertainment and according to my research they choose the strongest most expensive certificate from the certifing authority they could get (would of cost them $1200)<br />

So for the last time its legit</div></div><hr />

AH is your friend :) Specially that you need a lvl 70 to unlock your DK, I think they presume you got enough gold to lvl your profession (at least the non gathering ones) Dunno waht they think about the usual farm profs like Skin, Herb, Mine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
actually, the new claim is that you only need a 55 to create a death knight, so they AREN'T assuming you have a 70 with gold to spare</div></div><hr />

I even found a 2.6GB WotLK version on torrents. From the comments under that torrent it seems like it isnt fake. But bad news is that you have to verify somehow that you're 'friend/family'. The good news is that people can extract some encoded files/info from it therfore it makes me believe that data posted in this topic is real.<br />
Keep posting stuff guys gj :)<br />
<br />
On the side note. Damn, undeads got crappy full-plate lookout like always ;-/<br />
<br />
---edit:<br />
On blizz forums topics containing info given above are being deleted now, so i makes me believe it even more xD</div></div><hr />

I thought &quot;meh&quot; for the new frost stuff, especially since it all seems defensive and only works on frozen targets. There does seems to be a very limited synergy between a frost DK and mage, but probably only in PvP since a DK tank isn't going to want their freezes being broken early by ice lance + shatter. Also it appears Frost Rune Mastery only works on the DK's own freezes.<br />
<br />
I think I will be changing my Mage alt to fire in WOTLK because (in contrast) all of the new fire ones sound stacked up with crits, DoTs, and new AoE!<br />
(the Frostfire bolt will also add some slowing and fire dmg combined)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Liathi</div><div class="date">2008-05-20, 08:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">probably not, in reference to the gnome stomping. I checked a map of Ellwynn forest, it is plausible. There is a coast line behind stormwind. And if you think about it, since stormwind was the last place the orcs attacked back in WC1, how did the fleet of refugees sail away from them? Odds are, Stormwind harbor. Also explains how the defias were gonna use that ogre juggernaut in deadmines to attack the city. Reason we haven't seen it yet? well, since stormwind had to be rebuilt, maybe they focused on the city, and other problems caused them to delay working on the docks. (aka, blizz thought it would be good to add them now, and introduce them into lore, etc.)</div></div><hr />

What do you mean still waiting? There are already movies with ingame footage. I've personally seen around 400 screenshots and a couple movies from emulated servers.<br />
What you waiting for? :]</div></div><hr />

Argh, cmon, there's like 5 topics max about wotlk leaks on these forums. Do a little research. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

You won't find a server. No one releases these servers. They play there themselves for the exploration sake of it and post screenshots and videos from there. That's what I meant.<br />
If you want to emulate a server yourself, learn to code for 5-6 months and start lurking into the depths of the interwebs. ;]</div></div><hr />
