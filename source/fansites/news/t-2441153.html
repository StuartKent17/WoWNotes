They nerf the Blood DK with reducing their armor and reducing a talent with dmg reduction. But the real problem that makes Blood DK the best Tank in M+, is not being touched. DK just has too much utility. I as a Blood DK Main(or ex-main because i quit WoW but still) im upset with these changes. Instead of making Mass Grip a talent on place of Tightening Grasp they are not nerfing the utility at all. With Mass Grip as a talent, u have to decide between a slow or mass grip. That would have a big impact in BDK's Utility Usage and would make DK's to decide which utility to use. Now Blood DK's will be shit in Raids. But as we all know how blizzard will make blood dks good in raids in 8.2, they will make Mass Grip a 1 min cooldown now because that completely fixes every problem Blood DK's will have in raids ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) God Blizzard just look at the Feedback others give to u because u don't play ur own game at all and have no clue about this game. Your characters might still be 110 and u didn't even touch BfA by yourself. I thought with 8.1 ur going to fix this game but you do make it even worse it seems. Good job, BfA could've been THE expansion to make a comeback to WoW because so many people returned and were hyped about all the War. But u clearly missed ur opportunity and i don't regret quiting this Game atleast until next expansion because then u learned from ur mistakes again just to make a bad expansion after that again. BfA is now worse then WoD for sure, good job.<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Blood DK has too much utility what makes them OP in M+, Blizzard nerfs everything else that has nothing to do with utility to make them shit in raids and will buff utility in 8.2 to make Blood DK better in raids(what makes no sense but that is what Blizzard just does everytime)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously, there is still some time until this patch hits live (i'd wager the patch is aimed for December), but still, the amount of changes that were basically promised for 8.1. are still out in the open.<br />
<br />
Dps Shaman?<br />
Elemental received some changes early on, but outside of Surge of Power those were really not that big.<br />
Enhancement has received no significant changes whatsoever.<br />
<br />
There was some Talk about lack of strength of Dps Shaman during Reddit AMA, nothing that comes even close to fixing that can be found so far on the PTR.<br />
<br />
Shadow priest?<br />
No major changes so far.<br />
<br />
They're slowly starting look at Tank Balance, but Blood DK nerfs should be a small piece of that puzzle at best.<br />
Healer balance seems also starting, but Disc nerfs and bit of Resto buffs aren't enough to solve that problem.<br />
<br />
Unless 8.1 is supposed to hit live way later than i anticipate, big changes on multiple issues hopefully roll out sooner than later.<br />
As said above, i feel like during the BfA Beta where you have major issues on Beta, hope that the next build addresses those and next to nothing happens.</div></div><hr />

main issue I honestly believe <br />
Ion and the team as a whole truly cant accept BFA has the problems it does.<br />
they get people are unhappy so making changes but as you highlighted so far the changes<br />
are hardly groundbreaking.<br />
<br />
Azerite traits are still boring. If 8.2 isnt going to really tackle the core problems of BFA<br />
dread to think of the state the game will be in by mid 2019</div></div><hr />

No, they don't. They have exactly the right amount of utility. All other tanks just have too little.</div></div><hr />

Nothing for protection warriors, nothing for guardian druids, and they nerfed the entirely wrong aspect of blood DKs. Wow, so far they've managed to make tank balance worse. I didn't think it was possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The team doesn't have enough resources to do these changes they want. As I've mentioned before, so many things this expansion point at there being a lack of engineering resources on the BfA team. <br />
<br />
Until someone higher up at Blizzard allocates more staff to the team there aren't going to be anything but very minor class changes and Azerite is going to keep being these trinket-like traits.<br />
<br />
Studio executives are gambling on content being enough to keep people subscribed, while allowing classes and systems to rot - hoping that most players don't really care too much about these. They have so many projects going on at the moment and with engineers being a scarce and expensive resource, they're probably choosing to use them for the projects on their way to market.<br />
<br />
It must really suck being a designer or director on WoW right now, because these are almost certainly decisions made higher up in the system. Look at the body language and facial expressions of Lore and Watcher in the recent Q&amp;As. They're not happy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Couldn’t disagree with you more. Blood DK’s DONT have “too much” utility. They have less than Demon Hunters and Prot Pallies have a lot as well. What Blizzard should do is instead of nerfing, add new abilities for the tanks who are lacking. For starters tanks with snares are great and most of them have some form of AoE snare while a few don’t. Kiting is something tanks have to do right now and those tanks who don’t the snares, hurts them badly. Druids in particular suffer massively from this. They have real no unique abilities that set them apart. Whoever designed the guardian Druids arsenal of abilities needs to be fired. A 10 year old could do a better job.</div></div><hr />

Healer balance seems also starting, but Disc nerfs and bit of Resto buffs aren't enough to solve that problem.<br />
<br />
Unless 8.1 is supposed to hit live way later than i anticipate, big changes on multiple issues hopefully roll out sooner than later.<br />
As said above, i feel like during the BfA Beta where you have major issues on Beta, hope that the next build addresses those and next to nothing happens.<br />
<br />
I will take a big gamble and say that BFA patch 8.1 flops with the general audience.<br />
<br />
Yeah it has new content, new mounts, cosmetics, etc but the problem is the game is not moving forward and is stuck in neutral. It doesn't help that patch 8.1 is stuck in a beta state. :/<br />
<br />

<br />
The team doesn't have enough resources to do these changes they want. As I've mentioned before, so many things this expansion point at there being a lack of engineering resources on the BfA team. <br />
<br />
Until someone higher up at Blizzard allocates more staff to the team there aren't going to be anything but very minor class changes and Azerite is going to keep being these trinket-like traits.<br />
<br />
Studio executives are gambling on content being enough to keep people subscribed, while allowing classes and systems to rot - hoping that most players don't really care too much about these. They have so many projects going on at the moment and with engineers being a scarce and expensive resource, they're probably choosing to use them for the projects on their way to market.<br />
<br />
It must really suck being a designer or director on WoW right now, because these are almost certainly decisions made higher up in the system. Look at the body language and facial expressions of Lore and Watcher in the recent Q&amp;As. They're not happy.<br />
<br />
I agree with you at this point that they lack the horses in terms of programmers. Something has to change with the bean counters to help this WoW team out which is clearly overwhelmed at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This doesn't however explain why for example they fucked up number tuning that badly.<br />
<br />
Specs like SP and Elemental were (and still are) lagging behind badly, Elemental and Enhancement lacked a proper niche, so you could at least buff their numbers to keep them competitive.<br />
They could buff both SP and Elemental by like 5% and it wouldn't make OP in any shape or form.<br />
<br />
But no, better let those specs rot until they can perhaps fix them a few months post release.<br />
<br />
They can't give every spec super awesome unique design, but fucking up the numbers on a spec that is so damn straightforward such as Elemental is just incompetence. period.<br />
<br />
The irony of Elemental is that got worse because they made it worse, not solely because it was left alone.</div></div><hr />

It’s funny cause I think it’s more so that other tanks are lacking big time overall. That doesn’t mean Blood Dk’s Are OP, it means other tanks need adjustments, improvements, buffs, new abilities, etc. I have 5 tanks at 120 tanking Mythic + dungeons and I can honestly say that other tanks feel lackluster overall. That means they need some love. Druids in particular need a LOT of love. Other tanks need some added utility abilities to bring them up. The overall toolkit is what needs some improvements with other tanks. Utility abilities etc, Druids basically have none so why would a group bring one to a dungeon when other toolkits have better tools</div></div><hr />

We need to do that by nerfing their utility and probably their ability to self heal ridiculous amounts in M+ (which scales even better with bigger pulls).</div></div><hr />

And on top of that, why is Monk getting nothing?????? Blizzards &quot;fix&quot; to horrible broken prot warrior was 5% stam and armor, but now DKs are lose 15%!!!!! Im so sick of them, instead of buffing a class/spec they nerf the others, because to them being nerfed is better than being buffedWhat always amazes me is that there are people who are making a living at Blizzard doing this constant class and spec tinkering. Does any of it matter at all? Why don't they just stop.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It baffles me why people realize this just now.<br />
ESPECIALLY after it was Blizzard who gave us this utlity in the first place, because we had less armour, couldnt wear a shield, had less evade than a druid tank and in the early stages of the Blood DK even less health.<br />
Except those times / stat disadvantages are gone and Blizzard just didnt pay attention how tanks developed over the years.</div></div><hr />

I think u are wrong, they don't have too much, others just have too less. But that means that Blood DK has to much utility COMPARED to the other tanks, i know it's not exactly the same, but in the end it comes down to the same problem, blood dk has too much utility atm. Blood DK is OP in M+ because of SURVIVABILITY and UTILITY. Survivability is being touched, but not on the way it would hurt the blood dk in m+. What about nerfing bonestorm from 3% healing to 2% like it used to be in legion? that would make a difference, and i still think that mass grip should be placed in the talent tree instead of &quot;Tightening Grasp&quot;. With that Blood DK would be good in M+, but not as OP as before. Maybe still too strong compared to other tanks, but then they should give other tanks buffs in terms of utility and for Warrior for example, Survivability too. The reason why Monk is better then Blood in Raids is clear, in boss fights you can't get 3-5 hemostasus stacks per blood boil, what in long terms buffs the death strike healing A LOT. Also u cannot use Bonestorm efficently, because it's not useful in single target compared to other talents. There is not as much use for utility in Raids then in Dungeons, but utility is what makes BDK strong. I agree that DH also has good utility, but the amount of utility is nearly the same but it's not as instant as Blood's(On DH u have to time ur seals, on Blood u just click 1 button and it's done, that's why DH takes more skill but if u play on the same level as a Blood DK, a Blood DK will outbeat u as a tank because it's so much easier and faster to play. Take Mass Grip for example. As DH u have to time ur mass grip seal, as DK u click one button and it's done. though it doesn't make a huge difference, a DH that times his seals perfectly should be able to outbeat a DK in terms of utility, but they don't.)<br />
<br />
Utility Comparison:<br />
Blood: Interrupt, Stun, Control Undead, Slow, Grip, Mass Grip, Shit Movement<br />
DH: Silence, Fear, Mass Grip, FAST MOVEMENT, CC, Interrupt</div></div><hr />
