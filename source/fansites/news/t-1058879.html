Patch 4.3.2: Trading Card Game Items<br />
The three new items were added in Patch 4.3.2 are found on the TCG Loot vendor in Booty Bay. They are part of the Timewalkers: War of the Ancients expansion. (Feldrake (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79771/feldrake/), Eye of the Legion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79744/eye-of-the-legion/), and Demon Hunter's Aspect (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/79769/demon-hunters-aspect/))<br />

<br />
<br />
Italian Localization<br />
Mentions of an Italian localization popped up in the Patch 4.3.2 files, but the actual localization is not in game yet. This does not confirm for sure that the Italian localization will be added, just hints that it might be. Let's just wait to see if there is anything official about it in the future before getting excited. <br />
<br />
<br />
4.3.2 PTR and New File Optimization Tech<br />
With the 4.3.2 patch we’ll be testing some new file optimization tech. As you may be aware, with previous major expansion patches (2.0, 3.0, 4.0, etc.) we’ve carried out a time-consuming process to reorganize the game files currently installed on your hard drive to integrate all previous patch files, essentially ‘cleaning up’ what’s on your computer and reducing the full installation size. This process used to require an amount of free hard drive space double that of the entire installation size to complete, which is why we’ve reserved them for large expansion-sized patches.<br />
<br />
The new tech we’re testing with the 4.3.2 PTR will process these cleanups with no additional hard drive space required beyond what the patch is adding. Because of that you may see them appear more frequently with patches.<br />
<br />
While the cleanup is occurring you’ll see a specific message on the launcher informing you the process is currently taking place. If you encounter any issues with the new process please be sure to visit our support site at http://www.battle.net/support/<br />

LFR Loot Rules<br />
We know this information. The item designers have plenty of spreadsheets too. If you're saying creating said spreadsheet takes an equivalent amount of time as coding a system in the game whereby item distribution accounts for the spec you're fulfilling in a dungeon, you're wrong. <br />
<br />
We're not that naive. We knew from the start of designing the Raid Finder system that we'd need to build a smarter loot distribution system to regulate fair play. It was also really important to us to get Raid Finder working and implemented with the Dragon Soul raid. We had to be realists about it. <br />
<br />
The loot system will be improved in upcoming updates -- including in patch 4.3.2, where it'll no longer be possible to win two of the same item for a single boss kill. But we're really happy with the implementation of Raid Finder and feel it's a great new feature for the game, and one we'll continue refining over time. <br />
<br />
Money isn't nearly the overarching, limiting factor people love to claim it is. And the common argument I see in response to the above quote is &quot;hire more people then.&quot; But I think it's pretty easy to understand that looking for the perfect fit for a position is not always a quick process, nor is the training of new employees. This is particularly true when one is speaking about development studios generating creative media. Expertise, design philosophy, synergy, etc. are very important to the success of a project, not sheer headcount.<br />
<br />
Our development teams are quite modest in size compared to a lot of studios, but it's because we genuinely feel it's not always good to have so many hands on a project. If that means we have to make tough decisions about how and when to release a product or feature, so be it.<br />
<br />
That said, we do still have plenty of positions (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/careers/index.html) we're looking to fill. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215443-mmo-champ-can-fix-lfr-loot-why-cant-blizz/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3870807687?page=3#47))<br />
<br />
Gurthalak, Voice of the Deeps Balance Issues<br />
There are several things that we want to follow-up on and clarify:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
We noticed Retribution DPS was higher than we expected. We investigated and realized Gurthalak was the cause. We further realized (and several players independently discovered) that the weapon proc was activating twice as often for Retribution as intended.<br />
Retribution was getting more than twice as many proc chances than we intended. This was caused by the application of Censure, not the dot itself ticking.<br />
This was not an accidental bug fix of some sort. The proc was happening more often than we expected and desired, leading to damage higher than we expected and desired, so we took steps to fix it.<br />
We changed the duration of Gurthalak’s proc some time ago. The 4.3.2 tooltip change simply acknowledges this fix. The weapon’s damage should not change in 4.3.2.<br />
Gurthalak is still a fantastic weapon for Retribution paladins and any other two-handed DPS plate-wearers. The average DPS reduction is lower than the 10% figure some have quoted. The sword’s damage can be quite variable, and there are isolated cases where it may have briefly contributed 20% or more of someone’s damage, but those are statistical outliers.<br />
Being nerfed is never fun. We get that. The increased proc chance was our mistake, as always, and we apologize for not catching it sooner. Retribution paladin damage for players without Gurthalak is where we intended it to be. We expect Retribution damage with this change to also end up where we intend it to be. If damage falls unacceptably low for some reason, we will certainly consider taking additional measures.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, thank you very much for all of the useful feedback. We pay close attention to these things. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/215382-gurth-far-more-broken-in-pvp-pve-than-dwtr/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3811455871?page=19#372)) <br />

Just an FYI, the last TCG expansion that came out was &quot;Throne of the Tides&quot; which was released on October 11, which i probably dont need to say was almost 3 months ago. <br />

<br />
Honestly, it was nice that they were able to pick up on such a bug but.... the sword's proc is now near-neglible compared to other specs. I would hope Blizzard would know better than to balance a class around a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then why, I wonder, was the dev team unable to notice another glaringly obvious oversight in the LFR system, such as, oh say, the major bug that allowed people to run LFR lockouts and the normal dungeon lockouts separately-acquiring more loot than intended? Maybe this came to your attention recently? I think it caused some minor issues in the race for world first Dragon Soul? Was that your idea of fair play, maybe?<br />
<br />
I don't know what they are paying you guys for over there, but it certainly isn't to think. If this is your idea of PR then maybe you guys need to hire a new monkey to post on the forums for you<br />
<br />
.It sounds like it &quot;was also really important to [you] to get Raid Finder working and implemented with the Dragon Soul raid&quot; so much that you rushed it and made a huge oversight. This is all well and good, we're all human right? What I don't get is that instead of owning up to your mistake you decide to punish your players for not knowing how you wanted them to use a new and original loot and lockout system that they the majority of the playerbase had no exposure to outside of the PTR. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the PTR, why didn't you guys nail this bug on the PTR before it went life? Isn't that the purpose of the PTR? Maybe I'm mistaken.But there's a cherry on this cake-instead of banning everyone who abused your mistake, you only bother to ban the top guilds and simply ignore your average joe guild who did precisely the same despite the compilation of evidence from local sources on your very servers.<br />
<br />
That's some kinda magic trick you have going there, Blizz.</div></div><hr />

That's for the Throne of Tides booster box, which holds 36 packs. You regular 24 booster pack boxes go from anywhere £30 to £150, depending on the rarity of items you might get. That's how they make money, in all those crap card games - booster packs.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what they are paying you guys for over there, but it certainly isn't to think. If this is your idea of PR then maybe you guys need to hire a new monkey to post on the forums for you<br />
<br />
.It sounds like it &quot;was also really important to [you] to get Raid Finder working and implemented with the Dragon Soul raid&quot; so much that you rushed it and made a huge oversight. This is all well and good, we're all human right? What I don't get is that instead of owning up to your mistake you decide to punish your players for not knowing how you wanted them to use a new and original loot and lockout system that they the majority of the playerbase had no exposure to outside of the PTR. <br />

Speaking of the PTR, why didn't you guys nail this bug on the PTR before it went life? Isn't that the purpose of the PTR? Maybe I'm mistaken.But there's a cherry on this cake-instead of banning everyone who abused your mistake, you only bother to ban the top guilds and simply ignore your average joe guild who did precisely the same despite the compilation of evidence from local sources on your very servers.<br />
<br />
That's some kinda magic trick you have going there, Blizz.<br />
<br />
Maybe because since they use the players to find and report bugs in their PTR patches, if NOBODY reports it, they won't even know (wich is a huge mistake leaving all to the players to find AND report).<br />
<br />
What about said banned users found that exploit on the PTR and &quot;lol, let's not report this and see if it goes live so we can use it?&quot;...<br />
<br />
Also, this fix for not winning the same item twice... still not good since it won't take other bosses in consideration... they'll only not being able to win on the same boss, but you get the same token dropping again from another boss in the same LFR run.<br />

get a job maybe? you also dont pay blizzard to produce content. You pay the right to access the game servers every month, i think all the patches they give you for free should be enough for you not to whine.<br />
<br />
You're mistaken on that, the monthly fee also includes giving support to create new content. Otherwise the fee would be lower than current one for access only.</div></div><hr />

Now we just see reskins or ugly mounts like Celestial steed or Tyrael's Charger or reskins. I stumbled across a video of some game called Weapons of War or something, its titled wow mounts and they have some pretty badass mounts. Where are the designers blizzard should be hiring for our money, I mean were paying them ALOT and we dont even get cool things, yet we dont even get things we can get at all, unless you spend MORE money. I think blizzard is hiring too many newbies to work for them when it comes to desinging mounts and pets, especially mounts. I mean, I bet its like 1$/hour or something, or maybe they're working for free.</div></div><hr />

It'll transform you into a Demon Hunter (probably with a NE skelleton, or even your own race + new gear and twin blades as weapons). Just like the Orb of the Sin'dorei (http://www.wowhead.com/item=35275/orb-of-the-sindorei) (awesome item!

<br />
What he's saying is that millions of people pay a subscription fee + cost of expansions expecting new content. Instead they get reused assets, and then stuff like these TCG mounts, paid mounts/pets, etc etc is dangled in their face. The fanboys eat it up, but those with a shred of common sense realize that this stuff is replacing what should be new assets for the &quot;base&quot; content of the game. It is a sideways version of DLC.<br />
<br />
I wonder if MoP will introduce instances/dungeons that are only accessible if you have a certain store bought item.<br />
<br />
Subscription Fee pays not only for servers and support, but also a continually updated and dynamic world.<br />
<br />
To quote their support page:<br />
<br />
In addition to benefiting from regular expansive content updates from our ongoing live development team, World of Warcraft has its own dedicated server infrastructure and internal support staff. The entire game takes place online, in a persistent, ever-changing game world that can host hundreds of thousands of players at any given time of the day. As such, it requires much higher levels of support, maintenance, and network bandwidth than other games.<br />
<br />
Where have these &quot;expansive content updates&quot; gone? Why are there paid &quot;expansions&quot; if there is supposed to be &quot;expansive content updates&quot; solely from the subscription fee itself ?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cyrakhis</div><div class="date">2012-01-07, 03:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As per the LFR loot restrictions, this is nice! I would sure like to see most of the items that drop become unique - It seems people roll on them to sell them for gold lately, kind of annoying. Being able to find a way to make you only get the roll bonus for one piece of tier in that slot would be nice too. Losing a tier helm to a guy wearing the 397 version of it is kinda annoying. Oh well, less QQ more pewpew =D</div></div><hr />

<br />
Last i checked those were called &quot;major content patches.&quot; We get those, at least 3 times per expansion, usually four. Whether or not you think the raidfinder's more substantial than a chicken mount is your own choice.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rytrik</div><div class="date">2012-01-07, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">&quot;If you're saying creating said spreadsheet takes an equivalent amount of time as coding a system in the game whereby item distribution accounts for the spec you're fulfilling in a dungeon, you're wrong.

Maybe this came to your attention recently? I think it caused some minor issues in the race for world first Dragon Soul? Was that your idea of fair play, maybe? <br />
<br />
LFR and Normal/Heroic mode lockouts were separate from the very beginning. That was one of the selling points of LFR, in that people could run it throughout the week and not be locked out of Normal/Heroic mode version of Dragon Soul. Everybody had the exact same options for garnering loot from LFR. Everybody. KIN simply did it the proper way - Run LFR's with 3 mains and 22 alts, so the mains would get all the needed loot, whereas other guilds used an exploit (I can't and won't go into the details of what was done), and thus were banned. The first way is not an exploit. It is using ingame mechanics creatively. LITERALLY. It just took a fair bit more time to do so (having to run ~9 instances of LFR just for 1 raid group's worth of mains).<br />
<br />
So TheLoveCraft, what is the issue that you see in the selling point mechanics of LFR and how it was implemented (as designed)?<br />
<br />
And the quote you quoted had nothing to do with the separate lockout systems of LFR and Normal/Heroic. What they are discussing in that post is how loot is distributed to different classes/specs. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
.It sounds like it &quot;was also really important to [you] to get Raid Finder working and implemented with the Dragon Soul raid&quot; so much that you rushed it and made a huge oversight. This is all well and good, we're all human right? What I don't get is that instead of owning up to your mistake you decide to punish your players for not knowing how you wanted them to use a new and original loot and lockout system that they the majority of the playerbase had no exposure to outside of the PTR. <br />
<br />
Speaking of the PTR, why didn't you guys nail this bug on the PTR before it went life? Isn't that the purpose of the PTR? Maybe I'm mistaken.But there's a cherry on this cake-instead of banning everyone who abused your mistake, you only bother to ban the top guilds and simply ignore your average joe guild who did precisely the same despite the compilation of evidence from local sources on your very servers.<br />
<br />
That's some kinda magic trick you have going there, Blizz.<br />
<br />
They punished people who exploited. Simple as that. <br />
<br />
And again, what they are speaking about is loot distribution rules, not about lockouts. :) Go look up the LFR exploit and understand what happened, and why guilds who used this exploit were banned. And also understand the rules of how LFR works.</div></div><hr />

Then he's wrong in how he worded it. The mounts ARE available to him only he chooses not to try and get them.<br />
<br />
The TCG items are nothing but toys. A perk reward for buying trading cards. A large amount of people that play the card game don't even play WoW. Do they complain because they paid for the cards but can't used the items? No.</div></div><hr />
