<br />
Uldir is the starter raid so they typically don't get a trailer. BoD has one though. Full of some Rastakhan goodness. <br />

<br />
Of Kael and Illidan, Kael's motivations made sense. He was draining energy from the Nether with the stolen and repurposed Naaru ship he and others stole from the Draenei. When defeated, the Legion twisted his already strong need to protect his people when they kept him from dying, leading him to try and bring the Legion bsck to Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Illidan was supposedly gone insane after being beaten by Arthas to the point that he believed he had been the victor of the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Part of Illidan's soul was trapped inside Frostmourne after he was defeated by Arthas at Icecrown, leaving him more unstable than he already was with the skull of Gul'Dan's power. Only after Frostmourne was shattered during ICC was his soul restored entirely, as it returned to his essence in the twisting nether.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, though it feels like a missed opportunity he didn't use WoD Karabor for the flashbacks. I Get they might have tried to keep as close to the original, but yeah.</div></div><hr />

IIRC, the prequel book regarding legion discussed Illidan in depth. Never got to read it myself, but from a passage i read here, it was discussed how Frostmourne had trapped part of his soul. Unfortunately this is purely anecdotal since it was a quip another user paraphrased.<br />
<br />
Other than that, fan theory that honestly fills the gap better than any BS Blizzard has put out to justify killing Illidan in BC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it was for the black temple patch, not the raid itself, they had these for along time, patch trailers, and this was one of them, but they made it just a &quot;black temple&quot; trailer.<br />
unliek the cinematic you played above it was not played ingame, it was purely promotinal.<br />

The change from Kael'thas model to a Blood Elf model just to make it talk felt bad...<br />

yeah that plus the use of old models instead of new... like the old abyssal instead of the new infernal... and why not use a new kaelthas instead of switching?<br />

<br />
It's literally an issue of &quot;do you want new cinematics or remade old ones?&quot; And not just for WoW; for all Blizzard games. The cinematics team for Blizzard does the cinematics for all of their IPs.</div></div><hr />

i mean he was never developed to be crazy, he was always pointed to being against the legion, ever since his conception.<br />
just in TBC he randomly sent some blood elves to shatrath for some reason..?<br />

nothing was retconned, things were just explained, that is not retconning.<br />

No, but we were told in a number of places that Illidan had gone mad, obsessing over his defeat against Arthas, twisting it in his mind that he was the victor, not Arthas.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Waking_Legends<br />
Malfurion Stormrage says: Cenarius fights at my side. Illidan sits atop his throne in Outland – brooding. I'm afraid that the loss to Arthas proved to be his breaking point. Madness has embraced him, Remulos. He replays the events in his mind a thousand times per day, but in his mind, he is the victor and Arthas is utterly defeated. He is too far gone, old friend. I fear that the time may soon come that our bond is tested and it will not be as it was at the Well in Zin-Azshari.<br />
<br />
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Damning_Evidence<br />
As you may have noticed, there are servants of the Burning Legion all over Manaforge Ara. Kael'thas has entered an alliance with the Burning Legion. He must've caught wind of Illidan's descent into insanity and switched paymasters accordingly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Marcus Auralion whispers: Quickly! Get to the middle of the platform! Illidan's fury is soon to be unleashed!<br />
Illidan Stormrage appears, manifesting through one of the Fel Crystals.<br />
Lord Illidan Stormrage yells: What manner of fool dares stand before Illidan Stormrage? Soldiers, destroy these insects!<br />
Ten Illidari Soldiers - made up of blood elves, felguards, terrorguards and at least one nathrezim - appear and engage the party.<br />
Lord Illidan Stormrage yells: You are no challenge for the Crimson Sigil. Mind breakers, end this nonsense!<br />
Two Mind Breakers appear and engage the party.<br />
Lord Illidan Stormrage yells: Run while you still can. The highlords come soon...<br />
Four Illidari Highlords appear and engage the party.<br />
Lord Illidan Stormrage yells: Torloth, your master calls!<br />
Torloth the Magnificent appears and kneels before the Fel Crystal.<br />
Torloth the Magnificent says: At your command my liege...<br />
Lord Illidan Stormrage says: Destroy them, Torloth. Let loose their blood like a river upon this hallowed ground.<br />
Torloth the Magnificent says: As you desire, Lord Illidan.<br />
Torloth the Magnificent says: For Lord Illidan, I would sacrifice even this magnificent physique. On this day, you will fall - another victim of Torloth...<br />
Torloth the Magnificent attacks the party.<br />
Lord Illidan Stormrage yells: So you have defeated the Crimson Sigil. You now seek to challenge my rule? Not even Arthas could defeat me, yet you dare to even harbor such thoughts? Then I say to you, come! Come &lt;name&gt;! The Black Temple awaits...<br />
Marcus Auralion says: Return to Shattrath, hero. Seek out the wisdom of A'dal.</div></div><hr />

yeah these are TBC quests, so yes i guess they did retcon these. But to be fair TBC and Vanilla is back when their lore was just... rule of cool to all extent, and really made no lick of sense here or there.<br />
also to be fair arthas did not beat him, he almost did, but he didnt finish the job. so idk hes accurate kinda?</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I'm not really against the retcon either but Illidan was portrayed as a madman in TBC. Also I'm not 100% on this one, but wasn't Illidan dead, after their fight? With TBC they said he was rushed to the ER by Vashj and Kael? I might be making this one up, it's been like a decade but that's what I remember about it :(<br />
<br />
Tho, lol @ your sig. What a joke of a guy, isn't he? :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
he was killed, so was like all demons but dreadlords<br />
<br />
(back in warcraft all demons died. Then come wow aparently dreadlords would revive. Then come WoD all demons revived as long as they are outside of the twisting nether. Then come legion all demons only die if in the twisting nether, far away from argus, if near argus they could be saved using the power of argus itself, then ended once we killed argus)<br />
<br />
but then when wod came along and added more demons to the &quot;able to revive&quot; list, illidan too was able to be revived.<br />
<br />
also yeah, hes a guy who i used to really like but eventually started making weird conspiracies.. like for example in my sig, how &quot;Azerite gear is random and i once got a piece with traits for the opposite faction, that also was missing a trait for my spec!&quot;</div></div><hr />

He wasn't bad, just misunderstood! Just see now, such a nice man, I mean half demon elf. Still kind of a dick :p<br />
<br />
Nah, I agree with the major lore characters like Illidan and Kael'thas going bad was pretty unheard of. Two of the best characters turned into villains. Still miss Kael'thas. Just one more merely a setback Blizz??<br />
<br />
I didnt like going for killing Illidan(suuuuure we killed him, sorry, imprisoned) and said I don't want to, until I watched his bow drop, then it was okay. Such a nice looking bow.</div></div><hr />

Nah, I agree with the major lore characters like Illidan and Kael'thas going bad was pretty unheard of. Two of the best characters turned into villains. Still miss Kael'thas. Just one more merely a setback Blizz??<br />

After watching this, I'm kind of looking forward to replaying the Outland chapter of the WC3 campaign. Closing those legion portals was a MASSIVE BITCH, but the pivotal assault on BT made it all worth it in the end.</div></div><hr />

With TBC they said he was rushed to the ER by Vashj and Kael? I might be making this one up, it's been like a decade but that's what I remember about it :(<br />
<br />
<br />
Illidan wasn't killed no, him being taken back to Outland by Kael + Vashj came before TBC.</div></div><hr />

You didn't say something nice so obviously you must hate it and everyone involved with it and think anyone who likes it is trash. This is the forum brain at work pay no attention to it.</div></div><hr />
