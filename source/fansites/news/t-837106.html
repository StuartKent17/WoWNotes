Nah, but if it would be Ensidia or Paragon who would be in a post for world 2nd this post would be filled with angry &quot;why is this thing worth mentioning, you are such a fanboy&quot; posts.

In Paragon's video, in last phase they don't DPS adds, and focus mainly on boss. I guess Method killed adds too? Paragon just burned boss down. But we cannot be sure, until Method releases video :/</div></div><hr />

You won't. This is the Internet. What will happen is that those people who made all those &quot;totally confident 100% correct&quot; claims about the Sinestra fight will do one of the following: <br />
<br />
1) In light of evidence showing they didn't have the slightest clue what they were talking about, will simply vanish from the discussion entirely. Or, <br />
2) Suddenly, on the spot, invent entirely new and even MORE outlandish claims in an attempt to shoehorn their own justification while dismissing all presented evidence as false or &quot;not good enough&quot; <br />
<br />
<br />
I (heart) The Internet :D</div></div><hr />

i'm sure they could be replaced by holy priest\resto druid and another dd but i think that shamans are good players and partners thats why they are in the raid :)<br />

<br />
I don't think the voiceacting is bad, but they all sound way too similar and even their quotes have pretty strong resemblance.<br />
<br />
The voiceacting is bad. There is absolutely no emotion in it whatsoever. Just blatant &quot;blablabla&quot;, which is a shame as some voiceactors are good, but 80% of them are pretty crap. Some machinema voice actors are better then the ones who work for Blizzard. Though there's not many good female voice actors out there.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stressball</div><div class="date">2011-01-23, 09:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's funny how ppl compare DPS between classes. &quot;This mage here is way down on the list compared to the other two&quot; - &quot;look at the shaman, so low on the DPS meeters&quot;.<br />
<br />
Compare numbers instead. Over such a long fight, they only differ by a million/million and a half total dmg. Between the mages, ther was 600k difference and between the best mage and the shaman it was 800k. I understand there is min maxing going on over the board here at this level of gameplay, but for the most part, the classes seem to be very balanced if you ask me. So the best rogue did 20% more dmg than the shaman and the top DPS did 40% more. That IS a lot, but those are the extremes and might also have something to do about the nature of the encounter.<br />
<br />
Stop whining and enjoy the game.<br />
<br />
Grats to Method for doing this, probably without seeing the Paragon video first. Awesome job! :)</div></div><hr />

haste buff final phase, pretty much explains it, it is also the best secondary stat for unholy deathknights, and the top 2 classes on this kill are?<br />
<br />
People need to realise if your playing well it does not matter, the reason some classes do so well on this fight is because of that haste buff.</div></div><hr />

Blizz needs to get thier asses out of the place it's right now. And not nerf classes who obviously do not need one at the moment. Look at the difference in healing and dps the difference is just outlandish!!<br />
After a short break at the end on wotlk. Paladin healing is back where it has been the last 3 expansions. Way over over the top.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
475926.4 RDPS for Paragon, 569212.8 for Method.... nearly 4700dps per person higher, but still, that's a rather large discrepancy between 2 top echelon guilds.<br />
<br />
I'm fairly sure it's because Method kills both of the eggs at the same time, thus shortening P2 by quite a bit. We did that at one point as well, but that particular tactic got hotfixed - the dragonkin adds also used to randomly cast Indomitable (knockback &amp; CC immune), which isn't happening anymore.<br />
<br />
Read: We just adjusted our tactic to work smoothly every time because of the negative learning curve we were getting hit by. Didn't think of going back to some of the old stuff that wasn't working at some points.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Essence of the Red buff is fairly nice though. Being able to do 46k DPS while standing still is awesome. 8]</div></div><hr />

i'm sure they could be replaced by holy priest\resto druid and another dd but i think that shamans are good players and partners thats why they are in the raid :)<br />
<br />
Unlike other top guilds, we have a very small roster of raiding players (but those we have are thrustworthy players who earned their spot, no matter the class). So yes, we bring shamans. You should take those meters with a grain of salt anyway. Get a slicer orb in phase 3 and you`ll soon find yourself at the bottom (apart from Super, Super is always first no matter what...)<br />
<br />
<br />
Grats to Method for doing this, probably without seeing the Paragon video first.<br />
<br />
Obviously doing without. Even if we did, that tactic is no longer viable.<br />
<br />
Nice video Paragon. I especially liked the nerdscreams in the end. Goes to show ur not just some grinding finnish warmachine devoid of passion and emotion. ;)</div></div><hr />

resto sham is on the last place and priest\druid could heal better, priest have save abilities for raid as well as holy pals.<br />
<br />
in addition there are 2 shadow priest after resto shaman, they helped in healing, thats why Method could let to be restoration shaman in the raid</div></div><hr />

No emotion? Personally I think its more like there is a bit too much emotion for it to be convincing. I mean some of the best voiceacting in wow are done by people with very low amount of &quot;feeling&quot; (for example Algalon).</div></div><hr />

Method's got more world firsts this tier than FtH or Ensidia, so this is kind of nonsense. They're not exactly a guild that just popped out of nowhere and has never done anything worth noticing before.<br />

Exactly. I find it funny that all these people are freaking out about Method bringing a Resto Shaman when NEITHER of the first 2 kills brought a Resto Druid. You think Resto Shamans are in a bad place, why are you guys not asking why there is no resto druids in either raid?

Using the damage meters for two guild´s kills of ONE FIGHT is not justification for class buffs or nerfs. A significant portion of the damage of this fight came when all players had 100% haste buff. Haste benefits each spec differently, so in THIS PARTICULAR FIGHT, specs that desire haste more than others did better dps.<br />
<br />
Normal guilds doing ´normal´progression are not currently dismissing specs because of being underpowered. In fact, on my server, there is a lot of open debate when people actually try to do it. Any guildleader that adjusts his raids makeup because of THIS ONE FIGHT for TWO guilds should not be in charge of anything.</div></div><hr />

1) In light of evidence showing they didn't have the slightest clue what they were talking about, will simply vanish from the discussion entirely. Or, <br />
2) Suddenly, on the spot, invent entirely new and even MORE outlandish claims in an attempt to shoehorn their own justification while dismissing all presented evidence as false or &quot;not good enough&quot; <br />

<br />
Looking at sinestra for why your class is being nerfed is not a good idea. The fight gives you a 100% haste buff; some classes benefit from haste more then others; the classes on top are the ones that love haste.</div></div><hr />

We did that at one point as well, but that particular tactic got hotfixed - the dragonkin adds also used to randomly cast Indomitable (knockback &amp; CC immune), which isn't happening anymore.<br />
<br />
Read: We just adjusted our tactic to work smoothly every time because of the negative learning curve we were getting hit by. Didn't think of going back to some of the old stuff that wasn't working at some points.<br />
<br />
The Essence of the Red buff is fairly nice though. Being able to do 46k DPS while standing still is awesome. 8]<br />
<br />
How was your tactic hotfixed? :D<br />
Also, the dragonkins still cast Indomitable, but it's not random, it's predictable.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
and notfur had 2nd highest dps in this encounter (probably died later ) so stop QQ<br />
I didn't die.<br />
Just in P2 the damage we had to do (kill adds &amp; nuke mana barrier on Sinestra) is limited, so I had nothing to do.<br />
Everything was nuked by others before Sinestra and Calen finished their fight a la &quot;Harry Potter vs Voldemort&quot;, so I was sitting idle regaining mana (as I was arcane).<br />
We had 3 arcane mages doing only single-target damage.<br />
Paragon used 3 fire mages, who certainly did some AOE on adds, that's why their damage done is higher. Paragon's 4th mage, who played arcane, is lower than us :)<br />

But whatever some of the them were pretty funny , gj guys :D <br />
Now about the &quot; to be a shaman or not to be &quot; dilemma , you guys shouldn't draw conclusions from what top guilds are doing since wf kills are much setup dependant hence guilds like us , paragon etc always try to min max . <br />
Is resto shaman that bad ? Imo it's not . It's just so obvious that devs thought that since tide is so powerful and our mastery could potentially be op that by concequence our healing spells should heal for less compared to other classes . This however could change with the following patch . Can the shaman be competitive ? Yeah why not , u might need to struggle more than other healers do but it's definitely doable , especially on shaman friendly encounters . I agree that shaman class needs a bit of love but don't think that the devs will make us op just because a top guild downed a boss without shamans , only because on the next day the community was flooded with qq posts .</div></div><hr />

I switched my main back to my feral at the start of Cataclysm because it looked like my guild was going to be short on tanks, but I played a hunter as my main through almost all of WotLK, I still keep up with hunters, and even as an alt my hunter is still better kitted out than most of the pugs I run into. Every hunter crying about 'zomg why nerf us!' is either trolling or really well and truly can't read. Hunters scale very well with moderate amounts of haste, and need to gear to very specific haste plateaus in order to maximize their dps. Unlike some classes the majority of that 100% haste buff for 3 minutes is going to be wasted for them. I doubt they could even dump focus fast enough not to cap, especially as survival trying to time their explosive shot ticks correctly. Pointing to this fight, or really any fight with a major gimmick mechanic as a reason for anything is probably the most pathetic, baby tantrum, tiny e-fists pounding on the ground, teeth-gnashing, worthless, excuse for knowing your class I've ever seen.<br />
<br />
ETA: There are adds. If you haven't figured out that your aoe is chumpchange that does little but eat into your ability to pour on the single target dps, and that target switching is almost as big a hit, then you have no right to be complaining about the state of hunters anyway. Either one of those factors, the massive haste buff or the adds, should have been enough for you to think, &quot;Hey, this fight isn't a good representation of why hunters are being changed. Maybe it's a good representation that we need more aoe, except we're really not that far down the chart, so maybe I should shut my fool mouth before I look like an idiot.&quot;<br />
<br />
ETAA: I was all set to go back to doing something useful, but someone is bound to start up with 'bu-bu-but aoe nerfs!'. Scaling. Big difference between a couple of adds, and a big mob, and the nerf is to the amount of aoe survival does on huge packs. Meh. Why am I even bothering.</div></div><hr />

about resto shamans mastery. its unique...and its unique stupid cause other healers have constant and reliable mastery but resto shamans have mastery that depends on health of the target, its not constant and not reliable. We don't collect mastery on armor only for Chimaeron.<br />
Yes, it can be powerful, but only on some bosses and in some situations, I'd much more prefer mastery similar with other healers mastery.</div></div><hr />

At 05:21 in the youtube video, you can see that the Paladin is at 48k HPS with 40% healing done, while the others healers struggle between 17 &amp; 11k HPS.<br />

<br />
Since you obviously don't bother looking at strategy guides, let me try to edumacate you on Halfus. Every time you release a drake, Mr. Halfus gets a 50% additional damage taken debuff for every drake released. So let's just say for sake of argument he has, on average, 2 debuffs on for the whole fight (more likely closer to 2.5 as averaged throughout the fight, but I'll give you the benefit of the doubt). That means you did, sit for it... 15k. Damn, you should write a guide.<br />
<br />
(Sorry, for my overly sarcastic tone but come on dude, are you seriously comparing yourself to these guys, not even realizing that they, too, got a large damage buff during a significant portion of the fight?)</div></div><hr />

Point was, we used to do that at one point as well. The dragonkins used to spawn at about twice the rate etc while casting Indomitable 24/7. It was the only way to even make it through that phase, then mop up any remains with the buff. The particular tactic we used for handling the adds etc got changed a few times all of a sudden.<br />

Point being: Things kept changing, so we just laid out a blanket tactic that could handle anything unexpected with ease and could prolong the fight for ages. We weren't counting on anything.</div></div><hr />

Keep in mind that there's a 100% haste buff for 3 minutes in that fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's obvious that Method lost world first because they brought shamans along. How sad is it that Blizzard STILL can't see the flaws in their class design?</div></div><hr />

This must mean that I have to re-roll another class, or QQ hard on forums that my class is underpowered and that this is a terrible thing!<br />

Awsome, sounds like that time I fell asleep on atramedes, damn that fights boring.<br />
On another note in paragons video 3 warlocks 1 of each spec makes me happy.</div></div><hr />

nice dps method better than paragon<br />
rogues must be number 1<br />
<br />
Any competent player knows that higher dps numbers don't instantly correlate to &quot;better&quot; dps.<br />
The large discrepancy is almost certainly due to differences between the two guilds' tactics.</div></div><hr />

Do you see ret paladin there? no?</div></div><hr />

I don't often watch the boss fights because I like being in the encounter myself, but this was one I was really into. I read all the WoW novels and Sintharia is in a lot of the lore, so I was happy to see her included in this expansion. I liked watching the video and was very happy with the voice acting done in it (as well as the music choices, which were a great match for this encounter). I look forward to the world first Deathwing video that will no doubt be released later in the expansion!</div></div><hr />

Ensidia (I think that's who it was?) did the same thing with their Sunwell world first videos and it was epic then too. Always makes me want to stand up out of my chair and cheer along with them. <br />

Excellent job, Method. Grats on the kill.</div></div><hr />
