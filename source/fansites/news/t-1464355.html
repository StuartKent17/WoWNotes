<br />
Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews<br />
There were a few developer interviews at the recent press events, so today we are taking a look at interviews with Ion Hazzikostas from Mamytwink (http://www.mamytwink.com/actualite/press-tour-interview-de-ion-hazzikostas) and JudgeHype (http://worldofwarcraft.judgehype.com/news/press-event-warlords-of-draenor-infos-sur-les-raids-donjons-et-boss/). A few of the important points are below, along with the fully translated interview.<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
The first raid will open on the 2nd week of the expansion, with the second raid opening a few weeks later. Only Raid Finder difficulty will be gated by wing, all other difficulties will be fully open when they are released.<br />
Raids will be less linear, giving you more choice of which bosses to do every night.<br />
Raid encounters will have more interesting mechanics for healers, allowing them to avoid the boredom that comes with just spamming the same skill over and over. <br />
The first world boss will be released with the expansion, with more being released as time goes on.<br />
Proving Grounds will be updated and expanded, making it a requirement to queue for random heroic dungeons.<br />
The amount of loot that will drop when you are not using Personal Loot depends on the number of players in the raid that are eligible for loot on that boss. If almost everyone in the raid is locked out of loot for a boss for this week, there is a chance it won't drop any loot.<br />
Normal dungeon loot will give you enough gear for Raid Finder, while Heroic dungeon loot will help you gear up for Normal raids. This will be important at the start of the expansion, as Heroic dungeons will be open before Raid Finder, making it the best way to gear up for Normal raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
Challenge Mode daily quests have (a chance?) to give you an epic item of Raid Finder quality if you complete it with a Bronze or better time.<br />
If the Level 90 boost gives you your first high level character, there will be a starting experience that introduces you to your skills slowly, rather than giving them to you all at once.<br />
About 20% of class skills and abilities have been removed to help address ability bloat.<br />
Ashran will use players from multiple realms to balance factions in the zone, rather than a buff like the one used in Wintergrasp.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
JudgeHype<br />
Dungeons<br />
<br />
From a design perspective, the revamp of Upper Blackrock Spire was a challenge similar to the creation of a new dungeon. The dungeon already exists but Blizzard doesn't just increase the health of the monster there. New mechanics will appear and developers need to give a real challenge to players while maintaining the nostalgy you get when you revisit a dungeon already played in the past. Of course, the fact that the bosses and dungeon itself already exist definitely saves times, even if the models are updated. <br />
<br />
<br />
Raids<br />
<br />
It will now be easier to figure out which PvE guild is the best. Right now, it's hard to draw the line between 10-man and 25-man difficulty and it's hard to say if Method or Paragon is the best guild for example. With the 20-man Mythic raids, this will be much simpler.<br />
The Highmaul raid will open after the release of the expansion, most likely on the 2nd week. Just like the Mogu'shan Vaults in Mists of Pandaria, Blizzard wants to give enough time to players to experience the new zones while leveling without having to rush to level 100 to start raiding. Highmaul will be located in Nagrand and have 7 bosses. <br />
The Blackrock Foundry raid will open a couple weeks later, it has 10 bosses.<br />
All the bosses will be available when a raid opens, except in LFR where wings will be unlocked progressively (just like the Siege of Orgrimmar). Blizzard wants players to discover the bosses with their friends and guild before they rush through LFR. <br />
Ion's favorite encounter in Mists of Pandaria is Lei Shen. The mechanics are simple to understand but hard to counter, and a lot of things are happening that make the fight extremely interesting. The team is very proud of this encounter, you can probably expect bosses in the same style in Warlords of Draenor. <br />
Raids should be less linear than in Mists of Pandaria, the goal is to do what was done with Ulduar where guilds could pick their bosses depending on the roster available that night. This is only possible if your raid has multiple wings, and Warlords of Draenor raids shouldn't be too linear. <br />
Encounters will include more classes mechanics, especially for healers. Healing in Mists of Pandaria wasn't very interesting. In Warlords of Draenor, Blizzard wants to deploy interesting mechanics for healers and make sure their role isn't to just spam the same skill again and again. They will have to chose the right skill, at the right time, on the right target.<br />
<br />
<br />
World Bosses<br />
<br />
World bosses will be the biggest and most brutal creatures of Draenor.<br />
One of them is an ancestor of the Gronns we know, but 3 or 4 times bigger. He's made of stone and will attack players with stone shards and other earth-based attacks. <br />
The 2nd world boss will be one of the giant plant that lives in the jungle of Draenor. <br />
World Bosses will be activated progressively, the first one will be launched with the expansion.<br />
Loot will be interesting for the tier during the boss is unlocked. The objective is that when Blizzard unlocks the 3rd boss, its loot will be interesting compared to what you can find in PvE at that time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds will be updated for Warlords of Draenor and Blizzard wants to expand its functionality. It will be used as a prerequirement for raids. For example, players will need at least a silver medal in the Proving Grounds to queue in a dungeon. If you want to play in an instance with your friends or your guild, no problem, but if you want to join a random group you will have to prove that you know how to handle some mechanics of the game. This should be ready for Warlords of Draenor. Blizzard hopes it will improve the experience of players in LFD and LFR, and each player in the group should have the minimum knowledge required to fight the bosses.<br />
<br />
<br />
Level 90 Character Boost<br />
<br />
The LVL90 character boost will work differently if you already own a high level character or not. If it's your first character and you boost it to level 90 directly, the game will offer you 3 or 4 skills in the first place to let you familiarize with the game, and will give you more abilities progressively. You unlock your skills progressively, for example, a mage could start with Frostbolt, Frost Nova, and Polymorph.<br />
This will be included in Warlords of Draenor. Blizzard is aware that the boost will be available before this but feels like the huge majority of people who will use the feature before the expansion are already experienced players who already know the game very well. This is one of the limit of the system: Blizzard wants players to be able to use this feature but also understands that there's a danger to see poorly played characters because of a lack of knowledge.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ashran PvP Zone and Garrosh Hellscream<br />
<br />
Ashran is somewhat-based on Alterac Valley, when the battleground could last 30 or 40 hours before a faction wins. You will be able to go in the zone to do things that aren't PvP related such as gathering resources for your faction. Of course, the other side will do the same and it will most likely result in PvP anyway. Resources will have multiple uses, including summoning creatures just like in Alterac Valley.<br />
Garrosh will be in the expansion but it's unlikely players will fight him again. There is many other enemies to fight and kill and it's not really worth going back to Garrosh again after players already defeated him.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mamytwink<br />
Will each Warlord have its own raid? <br />
Sometimes, there will be 2 Warlords in one tier. Ner'zhul will be fought in a dungeon, the Shadowmoon Burial Grounds (level 100). There's no formula, what is sure is that Blackhand will be the final boss of Patch 6.0, as the end boss of the Blackrock Foundry.<br />
<br />
There's an updated loot system in Warlords of Draenor. Why make it so flexible? Is it to adapt it to flexible raids?<br />
It's an essential change. It was one of the big challenges to allow us to adapt flexible raids to other difficulties (normal and heroic). Personal loot is a good option for LFR or pick up groups but it doesn't work as well when you play with friends and your guild, it's essential to be able to give loot the raid member who needs it. It's a social aspect of the game that we don't want to ignore. <br />
<br />
The only problem was the number of loot. If we had chosen a fixed number of items, we would have had problems with the number of players. We instead agreed on a system where the amount of items depends on the size of the raid and the players elligible for loot. For example, a 10 player raid will receive 2 loot when a 20 player raid will receive 4. If 18 of these players already received an item from this boss earlier this week, which means that only 2 people are elligible, you could have 0 items. <br />
<br />
Are Garrison planned on the long term or is this more of a Warlords of Draenor specific feature? <br />
Garrisons are tied to Warlords of Draenor, they are bases that each player builds to help in the fight against the Iron Horde, the goal is to have players build an army. <br />
<br />
However, the technology we used to create Garrisons will most likely be reused in the future. <br />
<br />
You plan to increase the difficulty of Heroic dungeons in Warlords of Draenor. Will it be the same as WotLK/MoP or more in line with Cataclysm?<br />
In between. You can probably say the difficulty will be equal to the easy heroic dungeons in Cataclysm such as Vortex Pinnacle and the Lost City of Tol'vir. On the other hand, Stonecore or Grim Batol were heroic dungeons that were too hard for most players (in PUG)<br />
<br />
The big difference in Warlords of Draenor is that you will also have a normal difficulty for level 100 dungeons, it should be easier for players who just want to join a dungeon through the LFD tool. <br />
<br />
Players will only need normal dungeon loot to be able to join the LFR queue. Heroic dungeons will allow raids who want to go in normal raids to gear themselves up.<br />
<br />
Is LFR going to negatively impact heroic instances if you can find better gear there?<br />
At the beginning of the expansion, LFR won't be available and will only open wing after wing. Heroic dungeons will be available immediately and will offer the best way to gear up for raids. <br />
<br />
Additionally, we're adding an interesting reward to challenge mode daily quests: an epic item of LFR quality. Regardless of the medal you get (bronze minimum), the daily quest will get you epic loot! Of course, Silver and Gold medals will still award cosmetic rewards. <br />
<br />
Is Ashran (the PvP Zone) going to be cross-realm? cross-battle.net?<br />
The current plan is to have it available on each server individually, but we could make it cross-realm to fix balance issues between factions. We do not want to reiterate the Wintergrasp scenario with the Tenacity buff. <br />
<br />
Is Ashran a level 100 zone?<br />
Yes, it's an &quot;end game&quot; PvP zone.<br />
<br />
Is there anything you can tell us about Patch 6.0? Will there be a scenario or a world event? <br />
As usual Patch 6.0 will introduce most new features from Warlords of Draenor: new models, item squish, new raid modes. Only Draenor will not be available yet. <br />
<br />
The patch will also include an event in-game, but I can't say anything about it yet. <br />
<br />
The new character models are really awesome, but racial mounts are starting to look old next to them. Do you have any plan to update them as well?<br />
We continuously try to upgrade every aspect of the game, for example with the spells upgrades we did. The fireball from a Mage looks a lot nicer than 7 years ago, but we can't do everything at once. <br />
<br />
The new mounts released over the past few years are a lot more detailed, and I can understand that it will be weird to use racial/faction mount with the new models. This is something we might work on in the future. <br />
<br />
Do you plan to add &quot;bonus&quot; bosses to Mythic raids like you did with Ra-Den in the Heroic Throne of Thunders? <br />
Potentially. Like we did in the past with Heroic bosses, some of them might have an extra phase, for example Garrosh in Stormwind. We also like to have optional bosses like Algalon, Sinestra, or Ra-Den but only when it feels appropriate. <br />
<br />
We're obviously open to continue doing this with Mythic modes, and I can already tell you that when of the boss of the raids available in Patch 6.0 will have an important difference in Mythic mode. A nice surprise is waiting for you.<br />
<br />
A lot of players complain about the reduction of spells and abilities to play a class. Do you plan to keep reducing them further?<br />
We indeed removed skills and abilities that didn't feel essential to the game, a lot of DPS classes ended up combining them in a macro to launch them simultaneously. A Warrior for example would create a macro with Recklessness and Skull Banner, this is why Skull Banner was removed and some of its effects added to Recklessness. <br />
<br />
We removed about 20% of class skills and abilities, even if we will probably have to add a couple more. Players will probably ask for it during beta. <br />
<br />
In the end, we want to reduce the amount of buttons required to play and make the game easier for players who come back. The goal is to make the game understandable for every player, each button must have a very clear goal. <br />
<br />
Developers had fun with Karazhan in the past few builds, do you plan to reuse it in the expansion? <br />
Karazhan is a place with a lot of nostalgia and fun memories. We could revisit Karazhan at some point.<br />
<br />
We originally planned that Karazhan would play a role in the event that would precede the release of Warlords of Draenor, we thought of a phased scenario taking place in Karazhan. The place has links to the destruction of the Dark Portal and you would have been sent there to investigate on the subject. Finally, we decided against it and developers then had fun with the dataminers from MMO-Champion. <br />
<br />
Sorry but I have to ask ... when does the beta of Warlords of Draenor start?<br />
Soon™. You have to ask me this question, I have to give you this answer. &lt;laugh&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Heroic Dungeons - Silver Proving Grounds Requirement (Random Matchmaking)<br />
When we looked at Proving Grounds stats (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3672-Armory-Stats-Proving-Grounds-Parental-Control-Changes-Blue-Tweets-Fan-Art) last month, 27% of players already had Silver for at least one role, with no real incentive to do so right now. Out of the players that did at least Bronze in one role, 58% were able to get Silver in one role.<br />
To at least get everyone on the same page in terms of information, since a summary of a translated version of a translation of a few sentences in a single interview may not be the best foundation for a 24-page discussion, here's an overview of our current thinking:<br />
<br />
We will have Normal and Heroic versions of our max-level dungeons. (Note that we did not have Normal level 90 dungeons in Mists.) There will be no special requirement other than basic level/ilvl requirements on queuing for Normal dungeons or LFR. Level-up quest gear will get you into Normal dungeons/scenarios, and Normal dungeon/scenario gear will get you into LFR. Heroic dungeons will be more challenging than the Normal version (not brutally difficult, mind you -- just somewhat more demanding). You will need a Silver Proving Grounds medal in a given role in order to queue for random matchmaking for a Heroic Warlords dungeon. If you form a premade group, you can zone in regardless and no such requirement applies.<br />
<br />
In the past, challenging content and random matchmaking have often not gone so well together. Relying on item level does nothing to prevent a random group from getting, for example, a tank who may literally have never tanked before. Everyone has to learn somewhere, but we'd rather not have that learning come at other players' expense. One option would be to require a full premade group to do Heroic Dungeons, as we do with Heroic Scenarios, but that would present a very high barrier to entry (finding 4 other people with rigid role requirements is much harder than finding 2 other people with no role requirements). This solution represents a compromise in order to allow the content to see a broader reach via matchmaking, while minimizing frustration. <br />
<br />
And yes, we realize that by formally using Proving Grounds as a qualification, it will be incumbent upon us to further refine their balance and mechanics. We'll be updating them for Warlords, and we're confident that we can make them a fair test of baseline ability within a given role.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Warlords of Draenor Beta<br />
You have to talk to us guys. You guys can't just ignore us. We are fans AND customers. 12 Months of SoO?? Yes or No?<br />
We're not ignoring you; we're just not ready to announce a release date yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/428723666717638657))<br />
We'll give you plenty of notice, when we're ready to announce a date. We're excited for Warlords to come out just as much as you. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429004423130406912))<br />
<br />
Is it really typical for game studios to give a lot of advance notice for beta?<br />
For a beta? No, we likely won't give a ton of notice for beta starting. That's fine though, we don't need to. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/429034781670526976))<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds<br />
is there any real reason that the Proving Grounds doesn't magically keep your hit/expertise capped like Challenge Modes do?<br />
It does. It uses the exact same tech. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/431366327412862977))<br />
<br />
Thoughts on PGround enemies scaling up, not gear iLvl down? Would make for much more consistent practice/xperience across xpac.<br />
This is definitely something we're considering, but it makes tuning more difficult. Very interesting prospect, though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430858073851179009))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
what r the odds Orcs won't look like monkeys posture wise, w/hunched over gape mouth in WoD?<br />
The iconic orc 'hunch' is a part of their silhouette and distinctiveness, doubt the art team would budge on that. (Source (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/436972449691758593))<br />
<br />
No.1 hate atm is Silvermoon/exodar not fixed. And I hate that Cata may u guys so scared. Inconsistant world looks terrible.<br />
Honestly a revamp of Silvermoon alone is an ENORMOUS task. We'd lose a raid wing. And it would have little impact on game. (Source (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/436977036104454144))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Something people bring up is the removal of all race-class restrictions. I'm against this, but is that ever considered?<br />
Wholesale removal, no, but plenty of debate about opening up new combinations. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/429019917224910848))<br />
<br />
A little peek at what class design entails... The obvious part of our job with the new talents is designing them. But there's another side.. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430916335443267584))<br />
...Implementation! WoW's engine allows us to turn virtually any idea we have into reality (in-game, anyway). But how much work is required to do that can vary greatly. It can involve lots of data entry, knowledge of combat nuances, coding/scripting, creativity, etc. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430916887849873410))<br />
Some talents are super quick to implement (Malfurion's Tenacity, for example). Some require extensive work to get right, but are worth it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/430917398527373312))<br />
What, for you, has been the most challenging talent or ability to implement to your satisfaction thus far in your WoW career?<br />
Top contenders: Stagger, Storm/Earth/Fire, Eclipse, Divine Star, Alter Time, Chi Wave, Green Fire. Still not happy with some. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/431147574183993344))<br />
<br />
Are we getting a pre 6.0 &quot;stat change&quot; patch before WoD? Would give time to get used to it before WoD.(hit/exp in particular)<br />
What you're referring to is the 6.0 patch, which will be before WoD. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/431488657770311681))<br />
yea blonde moment, but are we getting any changes like stats etc in that patch?<br />
Yeah, 6.0 includes all of the systems changes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/431491555442950144))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Hey with the new season are you guys going to be raising the PvE ilvl from 512 to something else?<br />
Yes. It will increase gradually to 540. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/428960105875259392))<br />
<br />
Getting to a point in the season where we can compare this season to last directly. A bit blown away by increase in 3v3 participation. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430883106229198848))<br />
8 specs have more characters playing than the most popular spec last season (i.e. no, it's not all warriors) (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430883373909680128))<br />
Do you think it has to do with the removal of the team system? I know it has gotten me to 3v3 more.<br />
yes that certainly contributed (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430944621300948992))<br />
Just curious if there's any interest in sharing those stats more often/transparently or would it do more harm than good?<br />
always made a good point that it may lead to players focusing too much on data and not enough on their experience (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430892951862923264))<br />
Mmm, agreed. Having data available doesn't necessarily lead to accurate analysis. Trends are simply cool to examine.<br />
certainly agree. I hassle our data folks to no end. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430946146513461249))<br />
but look at how obsessed people are with representation numbers even though they are only 1 part of the picture. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/430946593420759040))<br />
The ladders are a good metric of how strong/weak a spec is. It's not the be all/ end all, but the numbers are important.<br />
It's the only number people have so they fixate on it. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431499396161605633))<br />
What other metric do you believe would be better? Too often players dismiss the numbers in favor of their own opinions.<br />
I think it's challenging to find the right metric in WoW. Leveling a new class requires significant investment. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431534333044604928))<br />
In a perfect world, everyone would play every class an equal amount and we'd have great data. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431534843801784320))<br />
Self-selection bias makes this nearly impossible as people choose characters for a variety of reasons. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431535021002743808))<br />
What's a stronger fantasy? Conan, Gandalf, Legolas or a moon-worshipping Owl Man? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431535249982373888))<br />
And which class, exactly, is Gandalf the fantasy for? Hmmmmm? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/431567088591699968))<br />
The thing is that players at glad level dont pick a class because of lore<br />
They also don't switch classes from season to season as frequently as some people think. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/431577287956250624))<br />
<br />
is the 3's participation in part due to the mount incentive linked to the ach?<br />

Except Silver in PG isn't required to queue for LFR, just Heroics, and those are optional in the gearing process, as apparently the gear from Normal 5 mans/scenarios will be enough to get you into LFR. It'll be pretty much the same.<br />
<br />

When one faction takes over the other faction could take it right back.<br />

Im also glad I finally got a better answer to the level 90 boost. As for the pre expansion world event Im pretty sure its going to be the red portal. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HandbananaWHAT</div><div class="date">2014-02-23, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We instead agreed on a system where the amount of items depends on the size of the raid and the players elligible for loot. For example, a 10 player raid will receive 2 loot when a 20 player raid will receive 4. If 18 of these players already received an item from this boss earlier this week, which means that only 2 people are elligible, you could have 0 items. <br />
<br />
Is this not a big concern for some people?<br />
<br />
A large % of the raiders will never touch mythic but still consider themselves more than a &quot;casual&quot; raider and will want the best gear available. What this seems to mean to me is that; as long as there is ONE person eligible for loot, even if you have killed that boss previously this week - you can go again for another chance at loot?<br />
<br />
This surely leaves the option open that one person who had already cleared a raid this week creates a pug, and only invites those who have not killed any of the bosses this week. So this would mean that say out of the 20 he invited, he is the ONLY one who has killed it already that week. That would mean the boss will drop almost the same amount of loot as if the whole raid hadn't killed any bosses and he can loot whatever he needs if and when it drops. That person can then rinse and repeat this, getting as many chances at loot as he is willing to spend time trying?</div></div><hr />

Sometimes, there will be 2 Warlords in one tier. <br />
Ner'zhul will be fought in a dungeon, <br />

Good reading, its for Heroic dungeons, not LFR. If you have 45 minute dungeons queues, you may want to consider moving battlegroups.<br />

Guess it's because some players felt forced to put Eagle Eye and Snake Trap spells on the 1-0 action bar. I guess it's thanks to those guys that those abilities will be gone. Because you know, the game is too hard.<br />
<br />
The idea of giving freshly boosted 90s the bottleneck ability float also baffles me. I don't see myself using this overpriced system, like, never, but I guess the people who would use it won't want to feel babysitted like idiots. I bought my end to the game, hands off me!</div></div><hr />

Right, because using macros to turn multiple spells into one is sure indication of higher intelligence :P<br />
<br />
Im pretty sure it has more to do with some classes having a relatively more complex rotation if they don't use macros (my warrior stacks like 5 buffs into one macro), vs some others having a three button combo (Destro Lock).</div></div><hr />

No, 6.0.1 is a bridge between MoP and WoD. It'll introduce new models, item squish and mythic for SoO. Whereas 6.0.3 will be the full out expansion which unlocks Dreanor and the leveling to 100. This patch is usually released 3-4 weeks after the initial one.</div></div><hr />

What game are you playing? 5-mans have no value right now other than JP really and they have the shortest queue times in the game aside from arena/scenarios. 5-mans which currently have no real value have a TON of players doing them... so I don't see how you can draw that conclusion.</div></div><hr />

Most MOBAs have 4 or 5 abilities, most people who compete in arenas have 30+ keybinds (and that's probably on the low side). There is a happy medium between the two. Was PvP any worse in TBC or WotLK with less abilities?</div></div><hr />

Totally agreed. Ner'zhul is one of the most interesting characters in the Warcraft lore, having a huge importance on our current timeline. From being the orc who was manipulated by Kil'Jaeden to start the war against the Draenei (starting point of WoD) to the soul converted to be the Lich King.

<br />
Exactly why he's a 5 man boss. For exposure. 5 mans are completely by almost everyone. He's an important character every player should know about. They want as many players as possible to be exposed to NZ so logically he's in a 5 man. SOME of them were bound to be 5 man bosses. They don't have the resources for that many raids.<br />
<br />
Also if I had to guess... they might not be &quot;killed&quot; in these early raids. They'll all just be bosses that get away, and then they'll all be a boss in the final raid.</div></div><hr />

A large % of the raiders will never touch mythic but still consider themselves more than a &quot;casual&quot; raider and will want the best gear available. What this seems to mean to me is that; as long as there is ONE person eligible for loot, even if you have killed that boss previously this week - you can go again for another chance at loot?<br />
<br />
This surely leaves the option open that one person who had already cleared a raid this week creates a pug, and only invites those who have not killed any of the bosses this week. So this would mean that say out of the 20 he invited, he is the ONLY one who has killed it already that week. That would mean the boss will drop almost the same amount of loot as if the whole raid hadn't killed any bosses and he can loot whatever he needs if and when it drops. That person can then rinse and repeat this, getting as many chances at loot as he is willing to spend time trying?<br />
<br />
They will probably make it so you can´t trade to players who received loot already.<br />
<br />
But otherwise, that is still a lot of work to organize pugs to do that, and then you still have no way of knowing if the people you are inviting are doing the same thing you are ( ie. already received loot). It would be an ironic twist if you did your second PUG of the week, and all 20 people lied about being able to loot the bosses.<br />
<br />
But I am sure they already thought of this and will just not allow trading.<br />

It's not the difficulty or how fast it can be accomplished. It's the pain in the ass factor, hop on that alt for a quick run, oh darn sorry, here dick around in this gating process for 15-20 minutes first. And that's not even mentioning how out of balance it is for certain classes or specs. <br />
They say they're going to rebalance PG, this time, just like they balanced it the first time. In the end they'll make it so easy that anyone can do it which begs the question, why fuck around wasting their precious resources they always whine about with it in the first place.<br />
<br />
edit: also I'm sick and fucking tired of them and the sycophants whining about resources, they measure their profits in the hundreds of millions of dollars if it's not money then it's employees and if they have a shortage of employees it screams of piss poor management that can't plan a route to the bathroom.<br />

Thats nice to hear finally nomore LFR hell to get Loot for the &quot;real&quot; raid.<br />

<br />
It very likely is only a first tier thing, as that was the only point where it's really a problem. Beyond the first tier if a guild is forcing their raiders to run LFR then your guild was abusing you, plain and simple. <br />
<br />
At launch normal 5-mans will provide you gear to make you capable of running LFR. Heroics will be close enough to LFR gear to allow you to skip LFR. LFR gear will be below normal gear, and so on. <br />
<br />
When the next raid patch launches there is no need to do anything at all to 5-man loot, or older LFR loot. Entry level 5-mans are obsolete and so is the gear from them, old LFR gets you gear for new LFR, old normal gets you gear for new normal, and so on. If they add new heroic 5-mans (unlikely based on past history.) then it can reward slightly better loot than the older heroics, but at that point it no longer has to compete with LFR. <br />
<br />
Probably the easiest way to fix all the tears about guilds forcing raiders to do LFR.</div></div><hr />

So, hahahhahahahahahahahahahhaahahahahahahhahahahahahahahah on ya'll. Good to be right.<br />

It is a bad idea, not sure what you're gloating about. It will either be too easy, like silver is now which makes the whole thing pointless.

<br />
idc if they do proving grounds or not. it doesnt ruin anyone's experience. if anything it helps new players learn what to do. people complaining about it need to just go do it now and get it done with and stop bitching. if u wanna do LFD heroics then go get ur silver in proving grounds now since all you are doing is farming SoO. <br />
<br />
Those that complain about ner'zul being in a 5man, i say that blizzard can just do as they have in the past where you fight him, take him down to X amount of hp and then Ner'zul spews some crap and then drops a chest and leaves. its been done many times before and can be done again. problem solved<br />
<br />
i dont agree with the raid loot deal, if 2 people havent done the raid but 18 people have, they should, at that point, lockout loot for those 18 people and leave it be for the 2 other players, just reduce the number of drops, but not to 0. or revert it back to personal loot. seems like a sketchy situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The bit I quoted cuts off the mention of giving the ability to assign loot through the usual methods (such as master loot) in the expansions flexible raids and the quote is just them saying that the amount of loot dropped will vary depending on the amount of people who haven't killed the boss that week. <br />
<br />
As others have said, if they simply made it so you can't assign loot to somebody who has already killed that boss that week, then there isn't a problem. But if everybody in the raid is eligible to be assigned loot regardless of whether or not they already killed it that week - it could create the problems I posted. Reducing the amount of loot dropped for every person who already killed it reduces the ability to game the system in order to get a better chance at items, but doesn't remove it completely.<br />
<br />
I don't think it's too much of a stretch to have people creating groups and checking the armoury activity feed of pugs before determining whether they can join or not.. and god knows what kind of shit it would cause for the top 10 guilds running the raids before mythic becomes available in order to gain the most loot per person.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, at the point Garrosh jumps in, Ner'zhul is nothing more than a broken servant of Gul'dan, only kept around to prolong his suffering at what he had made the Orcs become. It seems he's been elevated from that, but I can't see everyone else being pleased about what Ner'zhul did, tricked or not. It actually makes perfect sense that he'd be a boss of some 'not-so-important' place. He almost doomed their race.</div></div><hr />

&quot;but if you want to join a random group you will have to prove that you know how to handle some mechanics of the game. This should be ready for Warlords of Draenor.

Anyway, everyone is looking at this change from their purely selfish perspective of &quot;Oh I have to do Proving Grounds to get into a Heroic&quot; (Which isn't true, you can get in with a premade group), while completely ignoring the problem that this is trying to solve - i.e. Random queued groups which form and then collapse within 5 minutes because the tank was clueless, or because the healer has no idea how to conserve mana, or because the dps has no idea what CC is and stands in the fire.<br />
<br />
Anyone who played Heroic dungeons in the first 2 months of Cataclysm understands the need for this; it's about giving LFD groups a better chance of success and not just allowing 3-4 players in a group to fail simply because they had 1-2 other players from the random queue who didn't have a clue what they were doing. Blizzard are trying to make the experience better for the majority. If somebody finds Silver PG too difficult then they shouldn't be in a Heroic Dungeon. Similarly if they can't even be bothered to make the effort to spend 15 minutes on barely-challenging content, then they're not going to be bothered to make an effort in a Heroic Dungeon either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will only need silver PG if you want to use LFD for heroics, if you make a group with friends you dont need it. Read the whole thing.<br />
<br />
So what most of you complain about is, that is to much time consuming? Come on, even if you do silver for every role on one character it will take you less that 1 HC dungeon run. <br />
If you are concered that you can't make the silver PG, well, then you know why they are adding that feature ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
My only annoyance is Ner'zhul in a 5-man. Hopefully he doesn't get shanked in the 5-man, otherwise Blizzard has such a hate on for that guy. First Arthas emos and kills Ner'zhul with his mind after Ner'zhul gave him everything he had (and took away everything he had before really.) and now he's relegated to 5-man boss duty. Oof. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It very likely is only a first tier thing, as that was the only point where it's really a problem. Beyond the first tier if a guild is forcing their raiders to run LFR then your guild was abusing you, plain and simple. <br />
<br />
At launch normal 5-mans will provide you gear to make you capable of running LFR. Heroics will be close enough to LFR gear to allow you to skip LFR. LFR gear will be below normal gear, and so on. <br />
<br />
When the next raid patch launches there is no need to do anything at all to 5-man loot, or older LFR loot. Entry level 5-mans are obsolete and so is the gear from them, old LFR gets you gear for new LFR, old normal gets you gear for new normal, and so on. If they add new heroic 5-mans (unlikely based on past history.) then it can reward slightly better loot than the older heroics, but at that point it no longer has to compete with LFR. <br />
<br />
Probably the easiest way to fix all the tears about guilds forcing raiders to do LFR.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is not the main char and doing lfr 1 time to gear up the problem is that i got 10 alts and to be forced to do lfr in order to do flex e.g is painful.<br />
Right now you do the same raid over and over in different dificulties thats horrible, besides that people in lfr are either afk or dont know wtf to do.<br />
I want to run hc dungeons that give equal lfr loot all the time, either by dropping equal gear in new 5 man dungeon or by obtaining VP and buy gear like in the old times.<br />
That way you have much more diversity in end game as only running one raid on different dificulties over and over again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, the problem was most likely timing.<br />
Early BC heroics were also hard, but most people at the time had come from a place where epics weren't quite that common but where using CC everywhere was common. Getting rewarded a blue for doing what was &quot;run of the mill&quot; was pretty much ok.<br />
Then between that time and the end of Wrath the expectations of both performance and reward got flipped, and people expected (understandably) to be rewarded powerful purple items for very little effort and time.<br />
<br />
Early Cata heroics would have been right at home during BC, difficulty-wise.<br />
<br />
In that, as with a lot of other things, Cata is the perfect example of what happens when Blizzard strays from one of its core design tenets, that of &quot;iterative design&quot; - or design in small increments, building on what was done before. From a completely new world that alienated a lot of old players to 1000% more cutscenes to a difficulty spike that was 3 years too late and completely counter-trend, Cata was an abject failure in Blizzard's own metric of iterative design.</div></div><hr />

Silvermoon is HUGE. Reconstructing is FROM SCRATCH in 3D (much of it are just flat textures) is a very large undertaking and needs to be done by the people that design environments. (THAT INCLUDES RAIDS)<br />

So it would - literally- take people away from raid develeopment.<br />

That's because CC is easy to use, fire and forget type of skills in this game.

Each toon has/had to do the Isle of Thunder Solo Instances which take/took a heck of a lot longer, so I wouldn't be surprised. There are plenty of things we have to do on each character as we level them (you know, like leveling each one for example).</div></div><hr />

Why bother. LFR will outdo dungeons because otherwise their abomination would die. Challenge modes may drop 1 piece of LFR gear? HA! compared to what, 16 boss kills that are easier?

So if I'm understanding this correctly, heroic dungeon loot isn't better than LFR gear but since LFR isn't open the first 2 weeks, heroic dungeons are the best way to gear for normal raids just because its the best gear you can get for 2 weeks till raids/lfr opens?</div></div><hr />

Actually i wouldn't be surprised if he had more abilities in TBC. They already removed a lot of them and we only got one new ability in Wrath, Cata and MoP. Shamans, for example, definitively had more abilities back then with all the totems. Healers, too with all the downgrading.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That was the attitude they took with cata dungeons. Oh just wait, they'll learn to stop being bad. We saw how that worked out. Making a blog and telling players to l2play doesn't miraculously make them l2play. It's a stupid idea and it will be abandoned very quickly. I give it a couple months before they take the PG requirement out.<br />
<br />
On top of that i'd guess that most players do know how to play correctly but are just too lazy to do so. They just want to get the dungeon over with and don't want the hassle of moving out of the fire or focusing and ccing a target.<br />
The PG requirement will change nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I knew someone would bring up Totems. :)<br />
<br />
In TBC, most classes had dramatically less abilities than they do today. Shamans and Hunters (with both Melee and Ranged) are probably the exception. For casters, downcasting was used more in PvE than PvP.<br />
<br />
We could go class by class, but I think you'll find that most classes have a lot lot keybinds than they did back in TBC. Nobody says that TBC was easy mode because a Rogue had eight less abilities than they do now, now maybe there were balance issues, but the game wasn't any worse because of it.<br />
<br />
EDIT: And the reason I am speaking about PvP in particular is that PvE rotations tend to use far less abilities than you would use in PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How so? <br />
<br />
Right now, 27% of the player base as gotten Silver in at least one spec despite the fact that Proving Ground doesn't mean anything. When it actually matters, as in you have to do them (and I imagine you'll get the quest automatically when dinging 100) that number will be much higher. <br />
<br />
You have to consider a few things:<br />
<br />
1) Who are the people who actually queue up for Heroic 5mans?<br />
<br />
2) Aren't they already the kind of people who could get a Silver in PGs if they needed to?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed. And it's a silly argument. Silvermoon is the city I call home while raids are just something I'd run a few times and then will never set foot in again.</div></div><hr />

I really enjoyed the hard HC dungeons that we used to have. You don't need to start putting requirements on them. People will kick bad players soon enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you put out a poll that asked the player base do they want another Raid or Silvermoon to be rebuilt, the vast majority would pick another raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My only annoyance is Ner'zhul in a 5-man. Hopefully he doesn't get shanked in the 5-man, otherwise Blizzard has such a hate on for that guy. First Arthas emos and kills Ner'zhul with his mind after Ner'zhul gave him everything he had (and took away everything he had before really.) and now he's relegated to 5-man boss duty. Oof. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It very likely is only a first tier thing, as that was the only point where it's really a problem. Beyond the first tier if a guild is forcing their raiders to run LFR then your guild was abusing you, plain and simple. <br />
<br />
At launch normal 5-mans will provide you gear to make you capable of running LFR. Heroics will be close enough to LFR gear to allow you to skip LFR. LFR gear will be below normal gear, and so on. <br />
<br />
When the next raid patch launches there is no need to do anything at all to 5-man loot, or older LFR loot. Entry level 5-mans are obsolete and so is the gear from them, old LFR gets you gear for new LFR, old normal gets you gear for new normal, and so on. If they add new heroic 5-mans (unlikely based on past history.) then it can reward slightly better loot than the older heroics, but at that point it no longer has to compete with LFR. <br />
<br />
Probably the easiest way to fix all the tears about guilds forcing raiders to do LFR.<br />
<br />
That's great at the start of the expansion, but what about people who join up later into it? That's my situation with MoP, and I'm basically forced into this horrid LFR system if I want to gear up for raiding...because without LFR ilvls, you're going to have trouble getting into Flex groups, and without Flex it's a little tough to get geared up for Normal SoO, let alone Heroic.<br />
<br />
Previously, the entry level raid catchup gear was available from 5 mans + badges. That would get you ready to start performing well in Normal raids.<br />
<br />
Let's look at WotLK for example. When Ulduar was current content, its 10 man version was dropping ilvl 213 gear. The Heroic 5 man and badge gear was ilvl 200. You were barely behind the raiding item levels.<br />
<br />
When ICC was current content the 10 man version was ilvl 251; the Icecrown 5 mans were dropping 232 (only 19 lvls behind 10M raid drops), and the badge gear was ilvl 264 (same as 25M/10H drops).<br />
<br />
Now let's look at SoO and 5.4:<br />
<br />
The normal raid difficulty items are ilvl 553/559. 5 man dungeons drop only blues, max level 463. Badge gear is ilvl 522 (31-39 behind Normal raid), but it takes weeks to buy them...after which you have no VP left over to upgrade your gear. Timeless Isle is 535, but has bad stat distribution generally and no sockets...still a viable beginning towards getting raid ready. The only other avenue towards gear is LFR, and with being locked @ 1 kill per week, RNG might make it take 2-4 weeks before your character's ilevel is high enough to consistently find Flex groups. My Rogue is now finally ilvl 530 after 3 weeks of many hours playtime, and it's still hard as hell to get accepted to Flex groups...let alone find any remotely solid Normal/Heroic groups.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Right because the amount of skills you can bind = skill. Sorry but I have no interest in getting carpel tunnel trying to bind 50 abilities using combos of shift/alt/ctrl. I have a Logitech G13 completely filled with abilities (not macros, straight abilities) which is 24 buttons and its not enough. There is ZERO need for that much abilities. The key to skill is having less buttons and more meaningful times to use them.</div></div><hr />

I'm not happy with the change either because I think silver is too easy, we will still have people queueing that horribly fail at just about everything because they only had to beat silver.<br />
<br />
Yeah go figure, I thought oh noes it is gonna be hard to get silver but it isn't quite entertaining really what is even more interesting is that the achievements are account wide for that particular role, which is good for me since I am a DPS player..</div></div><hr />

I could not disagree more.<br />
<br />
I love how you list loads of way of getting gear, then say &quot;LFR is the only way to get gear&quot;, yes it is one of the ways but not the only one, you left out Ordos and Celestial s and crafted gear.<br />
<br />
I like the fact that I run different content to get gear, this is much preferable to running say the same heroics over and over and over again until I vomit, the idea of an alt is to actually play the toon right?<br />
<br />
I do agree on one thing you say (and one thing only) I do still think the Valor vendor should still exists, I think it should sell flex level gear.<br />

WTF is that?<br />
I think some programmers just cannot handle their job at the Blizzard. One more lost sub!<br />
<br />
If they dare to do this &quot;proving grounds criterion&quot; they will kill the hc dungeons too ^^ so funny how they try to destroy everything what they build up until WOTLK. I hate proving grounds: this game is not a solo game, so cannot be a solo content a condition to play with others... They systematically kill this game. THis is a huge back step like the removing of the mass summ was... I lost two good ingame friends because of that.<br />
If they do this, I will not buy that WoD thing.</div></div><hr />

In TBC, most classes had dramatically less abilities than they do today. Shamans and Hunters (with both Melee and Ranged) are probably the exception. For casters, downcasting was used more in PvE than PvP.<br />
<br />
We could go class by class, but I think you'll find that most classes have a lot lot keybinds than they did back in TBC. Nobody says that TBC was easy mode because a Rogue had eight less abilities than they do now, now maybe there were balance issues, but the game wasn't any worse because of it.<br />
<br />
Eight less abilities ? We got one new in Wrath, Cata and MoP. Sure they revamped the classes and sometimes combined old abilities to new ones but i doubt that we have 8 more then back then, especially since they twice already &quot;reduced the ability bloat&quot; and removed a lot of flavor abilities like farsight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just off the top of my head with Rogues, we have Shadow Blades, Shadow Dance, Combat Readiness, Recup, Smoke Bomb, Fan of Knives, Feint (now that it reduces damage), Redirect and Shierken/Mark for Death. That's 10 right there, and I'm sure I'm missing some.</div></div><hr />

if you want to play a game that requires no thought. play a moba like league.</div></div><hr />
