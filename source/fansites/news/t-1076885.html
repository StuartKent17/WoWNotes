Love Is in the Air once again! The event starts on February 5 and ends February 18 and brings us a new mount this year: the Swift Lovebird (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/72146/swift-lovebird/)! See below for more details!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/february/liita.jpg<br />
<br />
Love Token Rewards<br />
The same Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) rewards as last year are available, with the addition of the new Swift Lovebird (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/72146/swift-lovebird/) mount for those of you who really really like pink.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Romantic Picnic Basket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/34480/romantic-picnic-basket/) will let you enjoy a romantic meal with your loved one for Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) x 10.<br />
Love Fool (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/22261/love-fool/) drops a Love Dummy on the ground, it lasts 15 seconds and costs Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) x 10. The item has unlimited uses (Nevermind, it's one use only, sorry about that) and will disappear after 10 days or when Love is in the Air ends. <br />
The Dinner Suit Box (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50161/dinner-suit-box/) and Lovely Dress Box (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50160/lovely-dress-box/) will provide you with fine clothing for Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) x 20 each.<br />

<br />
A few important things to keep in mind:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have a lot of money and don't feel like farming Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/), you can buy Lovely Charm Bracelet (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49916/lovely-charm-bracelet/) from other players and exchange them for Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) at any Love is in the Air rewards NPC without any limit. If you really want to show off on your server and be the first with the mount, that's the way to go. <br />
The Swift Lovebird (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/72146/swift-lovebird/) mount and the Truesilver Shafted Arrow (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/22235/truesilver-shafted-arrow/) companion pets are not bind on pick up and can be bought at the Auction House. Obviously, it also means the event is a good opportunity to farm something valuable and sell it if you're short on cash. <br />
Don't forget the other mount, Big Love Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50250/big-love-rocket/) from the daily dungeon encounter! <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Crown Chemical Co. Encounter Rewards<br />
The Crown Chemical Co. Encounter is now available in your Dungeon Finder and you can run the event as much as you want to get one of the rare necklaces. As far as we know they haven't been updated this year and it's very likely that you have something better than the ilvl 346 rewards you get from the encounter.<br />

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
You also get Heart-Shaped Box (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54537/heart-shaped-box/) once a day, the box has a chance to contain one of the following rewards:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Forever-Lovely Rose (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49715/forever-lovely-rose/) will replace your hat and show your character holding a rose between his/her teeth. Cannot be used in transmogrification.<br />
Vile Fumigator's Mask (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50741/vile-fumigators-mask/) is an awesome looking fumigator helm but sadly cannot be used for transmogrification. <br />
Toxic Wasteling (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50446/toxic-wasteling/) is a companion pet that will grow in size if you let it eat critters! <br />
The Heartbreaker (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50471/the-heartbreaker/) allows you to break hearts ... why would you do that? You're mean. <br />
Big Love Rocket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/50250/big-love-rocket/) mount has a very small chance to drop from the box, and is the only reason why you will run the encounter every day. <br />

<br />
Farming Love Tokens<br />
There are a couple of ways to acquire Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) and they're all pretty simple, you can even grind them if you absolutely want all the rewards as fast as possible. <br />
<br />
1. Crushing the Crown Daily Quest<br />
Crushing the Crown (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/28935/crushing-the-crown/) starts from the Love is in the Air quest giver in Stormwind/Orgrimmar and requires you to destroy a chemical wagon in Uldum. Lower versions of the quest are also available (http://db.mmo-champion.com/search/all/Crushing_the_Crown/#table__search_results_quest=1%3A-required_level). Rewards Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) x 5.<br />
<br />
<br />

&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.mmo-champion.com/db/img/icons/inv_bannerpvp_01.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; /&gt; Crushing the Crown (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/28935/crushing-the-crown/) - Kill 5 Crown Technicians and use Snagglebolt's Khorium Bomb to destroy one chemical wagon east of the Tomb of Khartut in Uldum, then return to Detective Snap Snagglebolt in Orgrimmar.<br />
&lt;img src=&quot;http://static.mmo-champion.com/db/img/icons/inv_bannerpvp_02.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; width=&quot;16&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; /&gt; Crushing the Crown (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/28934/crushing-the-crown/) - Kill 5 Crown Technicians and use Snagglebolt's Khorium Bomb to destroy one chemical wagon east of the Tomb of Khartut in Uldum, then return to Inspector Snip Snagglebolt in Stormwind.<br />
<br />
<br />
2. Gifts to Faction Leaders Daily Quest<br />
Daily quests to give Gifts to faction leaders are also available. You can start the quests by talking to Kwee Q. Peddlefeet in any capital city, <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Alliance players can present a gift to the leaders of Ironforge (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24609/a-gift-for-a-lord-of-ironforge/), Darnassus (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24610/a-gift-for-the-high-priestess-of-elune/), Stormwind (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24597/a-gift-for-the-king-of-stormwind/) and The Exodar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24611/a-gift-for-the-prophet/). <br />
Horde players can present a gift to the leaders of Undercity (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24613/a-gift-for-the-banshee-queen/), Thunder Bluff (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24614/a-gift-for-the-high-chieftain/), Quel'Thalas (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24615/a-gift-for-the-regent-lord-of-quelthalas/) and Orgrimmar (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24612/a-gift-for-the-warchief/). <br />
<br />
<br />
You can complete all 4 quests every day, but you will have to travel to each capital city to start them. The quest itself requires you to kill 10 monsters (green difficulty or higher) with the Lovely Charm Collector's Kit (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49661/lovely-charm-collectors-kit/) in your inventory (provided automatically when you start the quest) to gather 10 x Lovely Charms (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49655/lovely-charm/) and change them into a Lovely Charm Bracelet (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49916/lovely-charm-bracelet/)!<br />
<br />
Completing one of those quests will reward you with Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) x 5 and completing all 4 will get you 20 Tokens each day. (Yes, my maths skills are impressive) <br />
<br />
3. Samples Random Daily Quest<br />
You will randomly get one of the 3 free samples quest each day. A Perfect Puff of Perfume (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24629/a-perfect-puff-of-perfume/), A Cloudlet of Classy Cologne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24635/a-cloudlet-of-classy-cologne/), and Bonbon Blitz (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24636/bonbon-blitz/) all require you to use an item 10 times on other players or NPCs. Pretty easy way to get another Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) x 5 every day. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
A Cloudlet of Classy Cologne (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24635/a-cloudlet-of-classy-cologne/) - Spray 10 people with the Crown Cologne Sprayer.<br />
A Perfect Puff of Perfume (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24629/a-perfect-puff-of-perfume/) - Spray 10 people with the Crown Perfume Sprayer.<br />
Bonbon Blitz (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24636/bonbon-blitz/) - Toss 10 people samples from the Crown Chocolate Sampler.<br />
<br />
<br />
4. Crown Chemical Co. - Dungeon Finder<br />
The Crown Chemical Co. encounter available in the Dungeon Finder rewards you with Heart-Shaped Box (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54537/heart-shaped-box/). It was updated this year and now contains 5 to 10 Love Token (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49927/love-token/) along with the old items. <br />
<br />
<br />
Love Is in the Air Customer Support Policy<br />
Love is in the Air from February 5-20, and with these romantic feelings comes one of Azeroth’s many special world events! World events are a time for players to celebrate in-game holidays, acquire special vanity items or pets, and earn those much sought-after achievements. As these things are highly valued by our players, our support staff is available should things go awry. If you’d like to learn more about this event, be sure to check out our Community Blog.<br />
<br />
There are some situations, however, in which there may be limitations to the assistance we can provide. While some of the policies below are primarily aimed at our world events, they are all in line with our other more general support policies. As always, exceptions may be made, particularly in the case of extenuating circumstances or bugs. Keep an eye out for such issues by visiting our Support Site (https://us.battle.net/support/en/) and searching for the issue you are experiencing, or checking the Breaking News (https://us.battle.net/support/en/news).<br />
<br />
Event Item Purchases<br />
Many holidays provide special forms of currency, usually tokens or other exchangeable items, with which purchases can be made from limited availability vendors. Many of the items from these vendors may be necessary to complete achievements associated with world events, so they are often highly coveted. The majority of these items are non-refundable, and this functionality is intended. As a result, make your purchases wisely, as Game Masters will be unable to facilitate such refunds.<br />
<br />
Achievement Related Issues<br />
For many, world events are one of the most convenient means to acquire achievements. Achievements represent overcoming extreme odds, having a bit of luck, and generally serve as a milestone for your character to proudly show off. Achievements are, by definition, accomplishments that require skillful effort and often a non-trivial amount of time to earn. Because of the intent behind achievement design philosophy and tool limitations, Game Masters are unable to grant, remove, or alter achievements in any way.<br />
<br />
Limited Duration Events<br />
World events can make time fly by quickly, so make sure that you get all your achievements, quests, and special events done before it’s too late! While availability may be limited, Game Masters are only able to provide restorations if they have accompanying logs to prove that a loss occurred. If the item was never acquired or the quest never completed, a restoration isn’t usually possible.<br />
Also bear in mind that the event end date will always be listed in your Events Calendar in-game, and the deadline corresponds with realm time, not your local time. We highly advise making certain all your tasks are completed well in advance, and wish you all the best throughout your seasonal adventures!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also note that some people were experiencing problems with Lovely Charms looting to their bags. I had to unfortunately drop the Grisly Trophy quest because it was keeping them from being created. Wasn't like that for my friend though.<br />
<br />
As for the pets and mounts being BOE, this seems to be the new direction for World Events. The Lunar Festival had some very nice BOE pets to farm for that you could transfer factions and make a pretty penny with.<br />
<br />
If you're looking for a place to farm Lovely Charms, try that open area in the Western part of Icecrown. There's 6-8 enslaved mobs in packs that you can just aoe down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hear ya. I'm actually a little bit bitter that I did the Ahune and Winter Veil quests every day but didn't get either of the new pets. I should have really created some alts since they're becoming account-wide. The same might apply for mounts eventually too, so it'd be smart to run this on alts.</div></div><hr />

So if you want a place to grind Lovely Charms alone, go to Halls of Lighting in The storm peaks, almost at the start of the instance is a place called The iron Crucible.

They are not available only via dailies. You can farm for Lovely Charm, use 10 to convert into a Lovely Charm Bracelet, and then purchase 1 Love Token per LCB.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why couldn't Blizz up the loot to 378 is beyond me...just sayin'<br />
Because there is no need to make it current. When WoW was on patch 3.3 (Icecrown Citadel), Blizzard did not update the loot table for the Headless Horseman either. Players still got ilvl 200 rings.<br />
<br />
One update of the loot table per expansion is good enough, in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

Grisly Trophies from Test of Strength share the drop mechanic with Lovely Charms. If you have the Darkmoon Quest you'll get few-to-none of the charms until you get all your trophies.</div></div><hr />

Nah they give xp any mob level 79+ that gives xp drops these, there's actually a better spot than this though and the respawns are instant. Deepholm trog pillars also if say you have a DK alt to farm with and you want to send them to your main wrap the necklaces in Christmas paper you cant mail them unless you wrap them. :P<br />
<br />
Could also farm them in Halls of Lightning normal the mobs just passed the 1st boss, they have 16k hp and respawn fairly fast.</div></div><hr />

I still remember when Midsummer Festival started in WotLK, Ahune still dropped level 70 loot. I was soloing him on my druid and bringing in alts so they could get the gear and scythe. If anything, Blizzard is slow to update holidays.<br />
<br />
You'll never see Blizzard upgrade a holiday at the start of an expansion and then upgrade it again toward the end. They may add an item like a BoE or a mount, but they won't suddenly upgrade the rest of the loot. The past is a pretty good predictor of the future so those thinking Blizzard would upgrade the loot from 346 to 378 were setting themselves up for disappointment. They won't upgrade Love is in the Air again until next year with MoP.<br />
<br />
Expect Ahune to drop the same loot as last year for Midsummer's Festival, too. They may add a pet or new enchant, but his loot will be the same otherwise. I doubt MoP will be out before then to warrant an upgraded loot list, but even if it was, Blizzard would skip upgrading it saying it was a time constraint, then force us to wait until 2013 to get level 90 loot from Ahune.</div></div><hr />

If you're prepared sit down for at least several hours to farm a ton of Lovely Charms, yeah.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gamon500</div><div class="date">2012-02-09, 04:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it possible to get 270tokens in 3 days?<br />
<br />
I actually got 190 bracelets (so 1900 charms) last night in about 2.5 hours. You can trade them for the tokens at the vendor. (I had 87 tokens already from doing the dailies and such). Here's a mini guide for hunters:<br />
<br />
Empty your inventory. I took a couple of guns on my second run, because my gun broke during the farming... you shoot a lot.<br />
<br />
Go to throne of tides (which is at the bottom of that huge whirlpool in Abyssal Depths, Vashj'ir). You can run past the first sets of mobs and FD if you like. Also FD past the big dude in front of the elevator. Go up, and you have to kill these mobs to get the boss to move. I was BM spec with a turtle for this, but my hunter is in horrible gear. I recommend trapping one and killing the other, especially if there are two healers. Use the shot that reduces healing, forget what it's called. FDing will reset all the mobs, so be careful.<br />
<br />
After they're dead, the boss will run back. You can Camo or FD through all these mobs. Get to the little room to the left in the back that faces the boss. Killing her took me a few tries, but again, my gear is weak. Use aspect of the fox so you can keep moving, run constantly, avoid the green stuff she lobs at you, if it starts to go wrong run into the little room and FD. Heal your pet whenever needed.<br />
<br />
When the adds pop, trap the big guard, and sic your pet on the two casters. Kill the casters first and then the guard. Ideally, the boss just sits there, but if you're slow she'll start her rotation again. Just keep running and kill the guard before going back to her.<br />
<br />
She'll call adds twice, then just burn her down. When she's dead, go click on the big machine thing that starts the cutscene. Then FD back to the teleporter at the start of these rooms and teleport back to the beginning of the instance. You want to go into the left arm of the lower floor (remember there might still be mobs here). Kill two of the big water elementals, but not the ones at the end of the hall.<br />
<br />
Now the fun begins:<br />
<br />
Spec MM and take any talent that improves Multi-shot (and chimera might help). Here are (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/tool/talent-calculator#Yc01!!YgkbkebQhd!Y) the talents I took (just for this).<br />
<br />
Put your pet on defensive, map your tab targeting to mouse wheel down, map multi-shot to mouse wheel up, and start rolling that wheel. There's a sweet spot in front of but not too close to the pond where you can hit all of the spawns. If you get hit at all, use Chimera a few times, but I did it for most of the 2.5 hours without moving or being hit. Watch a movie or something. Your pet will kill any that make it to you.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind that it'll take quite a while to convert all those charms to bracelets...<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />
