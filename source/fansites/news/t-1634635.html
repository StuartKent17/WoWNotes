Blizzard has been posting hourly updates on steps they are taking to improve stability and reduce queues. Recent updates include:<br />
<br />
<br />
US and EU maintenance was completed and added capacity by phasing all of Draenor and upgrading server hardware. <br />
Realm population caps were raised to normal levels in the US and EU once again.<br />
Realm population caps were then increased above the old normal capacity in the US, with testing of the same solution coming to the EU soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
4:00 p.m. PST<br />
All North American and Oceanic realms have now had their population caps increased. We are continuing to monitor realm stability, and plan to begin testing the increase on European realms soon. In addition, we’re making progress towards correcting an issue that would occasionally cause players to get stuck on flight paths when flying to their Garrison. Our next update will occur in roughly one hour.<br />
<br />
3:00 p.m. PST<br />
Our initial tests to increase realm capacity were successful, so we’ve continued to roll out our testing of increased population caps to additional North American and Oceanic realms. We’re also making steady progress to resolve the issues causing instance, world, and Garrison server crashes in Europe. We’ll provide another update approximately one hour from now.<br />
<br />
2:10 p.m. PST<br />
After carefully monitoring server performance for the last few hours, we are now testing raising realm capacity above normal population caps. We’re going to temporarily increase the population cap on a few realms in North America, and observe them closely. Our next update will be in approximately an hour.<br />
<br />
1:00 p.m. PST<br />
We are continuing to optimize servers and address additional performance issues. Realms appear stable with the increased population caps. We are monitoring server stability as Europe continues through peak play time and populations increase in the Americas. We’ll provide further updates in approximately one hour.<br />
<br />
12:00 p.m. PST<br />
As previously posted, both Europe and the Americas/Oceanic realms went into an off-peak maintenance to upgrade realm hardware, and implement a new Draenor-wide instancing tech to improve game performance. Both regions’ maintenances concluded successfully, and so far we’ve seen very positive results, allowing us to dramatically raise the realm population caps for all realms. We’re going to continue optimizing the in-game experience, focus on the new instancing tech, and hotfix gameplay issues as they come up.<br />
<br />
We’re currently seeing a very high demand on the game and game services due to the exceptionally large number of people excited to play Warlords of Draenor. We’re focusing on a few specific issues, one of which is a group of realms in Europe that are seeing increased instance, world, and Garrison server crashes. That’s being addressed as an isolated issue and we’re investigating the cause to ensure it doesn’t occur elsewhere.<br />
<br />
We’ll be looking into the possibility of Free Character Transfers for our highest population realms, but first we need to get the service to a place where we feel it’s also able to process a potentially large number of transfers while not adversely affecting service stability.<br />
<br />
Our next steps are to continue working on the few performance issues we’re tracking in Europe, and continue maintaining and improving the level of service in the Americas and Oceania. We’ll provide another update in an hour.<br />
<br />
11:00 a.m. PST<br />
We’re working to mitigate some localized instance and Garrison server crashes in Europe. We’re still seeing what we would expect to see in the Americas/Oceanic region for high queues on very populace realms, and for Europe there are queues across the majority of realms during their peak play time. We’ll provide a more comprehensive update in an hour on where the service currently stands as a whole, and what else we’re working on.<br />
<br />
10:00 a.m. PST<br />
We’re continuing to monitor the realms post-maintenance. Realms are being maintained at their raised population caps, and while many realms no longer have queues, we do expect that high population realms will still see a wait to log in. We’ll continue to provide updates throughout the day.<br />
<br />
9:00 a.m. PST<br />
We’re continuing to monitor realms and track any individual issues as they occur. We’re still seeing some issues occurring now that Europe is in their peak playtime, but with greatly reduced frequency compared to before maintenance.<br />
<br />
All realms are now set back up to their normal population caps. Queues being experienced now are due to demand beyond what the realms are normally capable of handling, and we’ll be looking into how to reduce them further.<br />
<br />
8:02 a.m. PST<br />
All Americas and Oceanic realms are live. We are continuing to monitor these realms for reports of any ongoing stability issues.<br />
<br />
The EU website and forums issues are being investigated as are reports of &quot;World Server Down&quot; issues and Garrison accessibility.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continued patience and ongoing reports.<br />
<br />
7:10 a.m. PST<br />
All Americas and Oceanic realms are now live. We will continue to monitor these realms closely.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continued patience and ongoing reports.<br />
<br />
7:00 a.m. PST<br />
We are in the process of marking all Americas and Oceanic realms live and will continue to monitor for reports of any additional stability issues.<br />
<br />
All EU realms are live and currently stable. We are continuing to monitor them for any additional reports stability issues. <br />
<br />
6:00 a.m. PST<br />
All Americas and Oceanic realms maintenance and internal testing continues as scheduled.<br />
<br />
EU realm rolling restarts are in the process of being completed and we will continue to monitor reports for additional recurrences of realm stability issues.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continued patience. Our next update here will be in approximately 1 hour.<br />
<br />
5:00 a.m. PST<br />
All Americas and Oceanic realms are in maintenance and continue to progress as scheduled. We are working as quickly as possible to deploy hardware upgrades and code fixes that are intended to improve both access to the game and experience while playing.<br />
<br />
Across our EU realms, we're monitoring reports of scattered stability issues and have been performing restarts to pick up hotfixes.<br />
<br />
We continue to deploy hotfixes for specific gameplay issues through the night. These are often fixes for quests that are not working correctly or not completing, as well as unexpected behavior of various game elements.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your continued patience. Our next update here will be in 1 hour, unless there is an urgent need.<br />
<br />

Thank you for your continued patience. Our next update here will be in 2-3 hours, unless there is an urgent need.<br />
<br />
2:00 a.m. PST<br />
Our EU realms have been up with maintenance completed, and players logged in and playing, for over an hour. We've gotten reports of some 'world server down' issues during that time, and we're looking into the situation.<br />
<br />
We will begin maintenance on our Americas and Oceanic realms in one hour, at 3:00 a.m. PST. <br />

Maybe those ppl need to ask themselves .. what was Blizzard doing in the 14 months before when the offered their subscribers big fat ZERO in terms of content? <br />
<br />
There is ZERO excuse for what has been going on in the past 3 days. If more players are playing than Blizzard expected.... Sorry.. but is there no quality control when it comes to how many digital copies are allowed to be sold before they realise that sever stability will be compromised? DId they even close down new players joining the most populated servers with their bought lvl 90s ?</div></div><hr />

They are grasping at straws now.. Trying to put famous PR worlds into every sentence like &quot;carefully&quot;, &quot;exceptionally&quot;, &quot;greatly&quot;, &quot; isolated issue&quot;... not forgetting to mention all the &quot; people excited to play Warlords of Draenor&quot;... <br />
<br />
Ofc .. not talking about all the players that are sitting in queues .... feeling everything but excited at this point....</div></div><hr />

Those that boosted characters to 90 with xp turned off are unable to turn xp back on. Those that wish to turn off xp at 90 are unable to. Trying to spread this into the public eye as the hot-fixes for today don't include a fix to our issue. Theres a rather large thread forming on the battle net customer support forums about our issue yet blizz is still ignoring us. They wont make a public blue statement about the issue. Please help to spread this into public eye.</div></div><hr />

On EU Hellscream here lag has totally gone away on our server and we are able to play fine now. So the updates have done a lot for our server the day before it was unplayable. Though we didn't have that big population on our server only few minutes queue.</div></div><hr />

But those of us in the EU suffering from garrison problems and those poor souls stuck on over populated realms are quite frankly fed up of this now.</div></div><hr />

Well they also haven't applied these &quot;fixes&quot; yet on EU. So enjoy it while you can. My server had next to no lag yesterday until they applied these &quot;fixes&quot; Now the queue time is still as high as it was yesterday and the people that do get to play lag like crazy, npcs don't spawn, and phasing doesn't work.<br />
<br />
Don't worry though. Testing was a success.</div></div><hr />

They should hire you :)<br />
<br />
Serious now, do you really need to act like that? 99% of what happened was having too many players. They EXPECTED X (based on sales etc), planned for well more than X, still had a lot more than that. It just happens, chill down :)<br />
<br />
This is probably due to the sheer ammount of people who ordered their WoD keys on G2A and alike and only registered them 1 day before release.</div></div><hr />

But now on Illidan the game runs smooth, no lag or crashes. All that really remains for US is the Queue Boss that does need to get fixed hopefully soon. But also it doesn't surprise me the High/Full pop realms have such high queues times as this should of not only been seen by Blizzard. But players themselves &amp; prepared themselves for it, like many guilds on those servers did.<br />

<br />
No I'm not, because I'm merely wondering and expressing MY opinion, not claiming to know better than them, or saying they &quot;lack intelligence&quot; because of ONE mistake which is prone to happen sooner or later to anyone in the software business :)<br />
<br />
How exactly is it ignoring logic? Why would Blizzard lie? They have no reasons to make excuses, they had no reasons to not prepare whatever they needed according to their predictions. But predictions can go wrong.<br />
<br />
You have people possibly buying the game one day before launch, you have people who've been inactive for long suddenly coming back and adding another active character to an already high pop realm... So many variables that can't be safely predicted, it just is very likely it's what happened.<br />
<br />
Sure, some flow design flaws helped make it worse, but most of the problems people are complaining about were directly related to the ammount of people on the servers - If you actually played on launch day both on dead time (say 4~6am) and on peak time, you would have noticed the difference. At peak time it was nearly unplayable near the garrison (which was even worse since you need the garrison early for progression). At dead time it was completly smooth, not a single issue.<br />
<br />
Try to calm down and be patient, and you'll actually come to enjoy what is an amazing expansion :) By being toxic and by conspirating agaisnt blizzard you're only creating a bad atmosphere and making the problem worse than it is. They've been working hard on it, and many players have already seen great improvements, and overall even with this launch you can't complain much about Blizzard. They're not perfect, obviously, but they still are one of the videogame studios that offers the most polish and quality of service out there overall :)</div></div><hr />

Sure there are still queues - which means more people are coming back to the game, which I think is awesome. At least when I finally got on, it was smooth and lag free. And awesome. I love what I've seen from Draenor so far.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How about comparing the capacity to nominal levels -say the annual mean?<br />
<br />
TLDR -double the capacity of a tenth nominal levels =/= good, hence we are still seeing crappy queue times.<br />
<br />
TLDR -Blizz PR machine still in effect.</div></div><hr />

Its blatenly down to money and bad decisions.<br />
A company this big after 10 years should not have these sort of problems. <br />
Keep making up excuses by all means, lets face it im sure in the back of someones head at blizzard the thought of 'hold it out guys once the initial rush is over people will somewhat forget about the launch and start enjoying the game' is happening, they have that ignorance about them.<br />
Seems to be most if not all there games blizzard makes fail at launch................and lets be honest,so will overwatch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They could have done things better, but that doesn't change the fact that a launch like this is almost impossible to get right, when you consider the amount of subs, the amount of servers, the amount of minor glitches (always present in any online game) made worse by the server load, etc. There are things you just can't predict exactly, and even if you do, have to fix after it happens.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Roguezor</div><div class="date">2014-11-16, 04:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know, I know... they are trying to fix things. That's good and all, but when we're on the 4th day of the expansion trying to logg on only to get a 3k queue EVEN after they &quot;fixed&quot; the servers by doubling the cap from yesterday (i had a 3.7k queue yesterday, no that much of a difference)...... that's when i get a little annoyed.<br />
<br />
I don't know what actually goes into fixing this queue problem, but when they they take down the server for 6 hours 1 night + a few restarts to do so, shouldn't they really make sure they have enough space/really do fix it then? And not throw a random amount of hardware or what not into it and go &quot;Now, this might fix it... no?&quot;<br />
<br />
Again, I don't know much about what goes on behind the carpet. So I'm not trying to bash them for not doing anything, but shouldn't they have the info needed to do an appropriate fix when they set of time for it?</div></div><hr />

First due to the lag issues, now due to queues. I saw 4-5k queues and 700+ minutes of wait time before the increased caps, and it's the exact same shit now. My sister in law spent 10 hours (!) in a queue only to get into a lag spike as she entered, getting DC'd and being back in the queue. <br />
<br />
Unbelievable.</div></div><hr />

Lol 6 hour queue yesterday. Started at 4400. Server population capacity doubles and this morning I've started at 2990 in the queue. I think we're entitled to be a little disappointed.</div></div><hr />

Double server capacity, half the queue... thanks blizz =D</div></div><hr />

1 doubled is 2 which isn't a lot. Give specific information or don't bother giving any at all.</div></div><hr />

Friday afternoon at 3:15 P.M. CST, the queue to get onto Stormrage was 6900. On Sunday afternoon, at the same time, it was 4900. That's not half, which means the server's population cap was most certainly not doubled. You can't tell me that TWICE AS MANY PEOPLE are playing and the queue to get on is only shaved by 30%. If you're thinking that's doubled, then math is not your strong suit.</div></div><hr />

I remember the &quot;old times&quot; when login queues were accepted as a price you had to pay to play on a high pop realm and Blizzard's stance on that was simply &quot;deal with it&quot;.</div></div><hr />

They upgrade their hardware to support the huge load of players because the game is/was unplayable for a lot of people. Then they claim they can't fix this problem with money and they couldn't have prevented this from happening. Plus all the other bullshit they try to feed their customers.<br />

Why would Blizzard lie? <br />
<br />
For money. They don't really lie, they are just not honest. They just don't mention their screw ups, except 3 years later when it can't hurt them anymore. And I get it, they want happy customers etc, but it's getting pretty ridiculous.</div></div><hr />

You are playing on Stormrage, it is entirely possible that a lot of players have returned. People like you are so fucking stupid it is hilarious.</div></div><hr />
