Warcraft III Invitational - February 27 and 28<br />
Over 15 years since the release of Reign of Chaos, Warcraft III has a new major patch coming and your favorite players are throwing the first Warcraft III Invitational to celebrate it! <br />
<br />
Hosted by casters Neo and Remo of Back2Warcraft (http://www.back2warcraft.com/), join us on February 27 and February 28 on Twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/back2warcraft) for a slew of special events, including Free-for-All, 4v4’s, and other friendly competitions. Well-known Warcraft III competitors from around the world will be getting together live at Blizzard HQ to showcase their talents in friendly competition!<br />
<br />
We love and continue to support our Warcraft III community, and we’re excited to see classic competitors like Manuel “Grubby” Schenkhuizen, Park “Lyn” Joon, and Kim “ReMinD” Sung Sik try out all the new PTR changes for themselves—including balance adjustments to many heroes, widescreen support, and more – all playable now on the PTR! <br />
<br />
Be sure to tune in for your own sneak peek and check out our PTR patch notes for more information.<br />

wtf are u eve talking ... if u couldn't host your own game its on your end because either firewall port block or u simply didn't post forwarded the port in your modem settings .. don't blame Blizzard and be happy that all these ENT bots etc are hosting games .. i don't see how they ruined custom games? there are very very minor % of bot games where the game mod is set by the bot 99% of the maps usually red still picks mode so don't talk shit if u know shit</div></div><hr />

I think because the new titan is larger than Sargeras (and the world scaled to her) they are now even smaller than everyone else</div></div><hr />

They gotta make something with the warcraft IP when wow finally dies. And you have to read the previous 3 comics or so to get it. I was super confused at first too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its part 5 of a short storyline he did---for context you may want to go read from the first one. The punchline of sorts for this specific one is that the two gnomes and Velen are all way shorter now compared to everyone else after all that crazy world growing/shrinking. I dunno if there will be a part 6 but probably. Fun stuff</div></div><hr />
