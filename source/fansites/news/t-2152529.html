Icy Veins - Nighthold Guides<br />
Our friends over at Icy Veins are finishing up their Nighthold guides, so be sure to take a look so that you are ready to go this week.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Legendary Item Upgrades<br />
With the Nighthold release, you can now pick up the Touch of a Titan (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45352-touch-of-a-titan) quest in Dalaran to start on the path to upgrading existing legendary items. New items will have a higher item level when they drop.<br />
Since the release of Patch 7.1.5, we've received a number of questions relating to the Nighthold Legendary item upgrades and how that process will work. We'd like to provide some clarity on what you can expect next week.<br />
<br />
When the Nighthold opens next week, players who have acquired at least one Legion Legendary item will find a quest in Dalaran (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/45352-touch-of-a-titan) to upgrade a Legendary from item level 910 to 940. This quest involves collecting a number of Essences of Aman’thul (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/143614-essence-of-amanthul), which can be found in the following locations:<br />
<br />
<br />
Nighthold Raid Bosses<br />
Weekly Mythic Keystone Cache<br />
Emissary Bags<br />
PvP Weekly Quests<br />
<br />
<br />
Once you have completed the quest, you'll be given a Distilled Titan Essence (http://www.wowdb.com/items/143613-distilled-titan-essence), which can be consumed to upgrade a Legion Legendary item to level 940. The quest is repeatable, so you'll be able to earn as many Distilled Titan Essences as you need to upgrade any Legendaries you have.<br />
<br />
Additionally, once the Nighthold is open, any new Legendaries you discover will already be item level 940. Note that this does not apply retroactively to Emissary Bags that you may already have in your inventory when the time comes. Only new bags earned after the Nighthold is open have the chance to reward an item level 940 Legendary.<br />
<br />
Will it be available on all levels of NH?<br />
These will drop in all difficulties of the Nighthold, LFR included.<br />
<br />
<br />
WoWDB Addon Data Collection<br />
The migration to the new Curse App (https://www.curse.com/games/wow/upgrade) continues with improved addon management support and guild servers.<br />
<br />
Quickly populating the database with new additions is done with the help of many players. The more people that contribute data, the more accurate and quickly we can update the database.<br />
<br />
To help out, just click here (curse://enable-wowdb-upload) if you have Curse App already installed.<br />
<br />
When you are playing the addon will gather data and save it. When you are done playing, Curse App will see the game close and upload the collected data from the addon. <br />

They don't drop retroactively. They will only be in bags that are obtained AFTER patch day so hoarding them won't help :P</div></div><hr />

7.2 isn't for a while. We just had 7.1.5. Nighthold is technically part of 7.0 but it was introduced after 7.1.5.</div></div><hr />

I moved it to individual boss pages instead, item levels for Gul'dan and a couple other bosses was incorrect, the individual boss pages are correct.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they had to name a day, and its tomorrow. if it was last week some people would be upset, if it was next week some people would be upset. I'm ok with legendaries not being upgraded, as long as the upgrade has a fair price.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Both of you are incorrect... Emmissary Caches weren't changed on the PTR. We know for a fact that people who hoarded caches and opened them after patch day received NEW LEGENDARIES (for example I got Beast Master shoulders)... so its a fact that caches decide their loot table as they are opened not as they are looted. So you won't be able to laugh... you'll just stay in a corner seeing those 'nerds' getting 940 ilvl legendaries. Caches weren't change at all last patch so... yeah... people hoarding will benefit, like me :D</div></div><hr />

Gameplay vs Aesthetic. I believe their whole theme behind that row of skins, as mentioned at Blizzcon, is &quot;organized&quot; group play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But couldn't they just upgrade the old ones to 940 or release the new ones with 910 and the questline?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And correct, tier gear will not be war/titanforged.<br />
<br />
Nowhere does that say they will not be war/titanforged, fact is they will be just like any other loot. When you use the token it gives you a piece, that piece can be warforged or titanforged, it's the EXACT same thing as in HFC.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
That post doesn't imply tier gear not war/titanforging at all. HFC had the exact same system and tier gear titanforged just as it does now.</div></div><hr />

Caches are decided once you get the cache.. not when you loot it</div></div><hr />

<br />
Incorrect. I know people who held off their caches for 7.1.5 and got theirs updated. It's possible, though, that maybe whether or not you get a legendary is determined then. But people in my guild who held off got rewarded for waiting for fuck tons of curious coins and such.</div></div><hr />

Except you're literally wrong, because its in the blue post.<br />
<br />
&quot;Additionally, once the Nighthold is open, any new Legendaries you discover will already be item level 940.

So you'll be able to enjoy getting some of the new legendaries, but at level 910.<br />
Whooooooooooooooooo</div></div><hr />

Specifically mentions that hoarding them won't work in the blue post. Good luck though, you might get a 910</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then again, if a player has a character with 40d played and top notch legendaries and what not, why should his alt with few days played be able to compete toe to toe in dps/heal/tank viability? Surely there needs to be some sort of advantage for the time and effort invested into the toon.</div></div><hr />

Would be true if you didn't want/have to change class/spec because you got crapped all over by blizz *cough* hunters *cough*<br />
Even the Hunter T19 armor looks bad</div></div><hr />

Who cares about new armor models?<br />
People transmog their armor into what they want it to look like.</div></div><hr />

Surely there needs to be some sort of advantage for the time and effort invested into the toon. But at the same time that alt may now get a brand new BiS legendary at 940 ilvl. Meanwhile the main character is forced to spend weeks to get legendaries as strong as the random alt's.</div></div><hr />
