<br />
In simple terms - pounds/euro converted to more dollars in the past...now they convert to less dollars so they need to raise prices in euro/pounds to compensate.</div></div><hr />

Especially character services such as server transfer needs to be a hell of a lot cheaper considering how unwilling they are to sort out server situations. <br />

And the level boost... holy shit, they have no shame. Guess making 800 million USD on a BAD year during WoD wasn't enough... <br />

<br />
The token already got changed when it went to nearly 200k and seems to reach that point even quicker now... yes I know it's supply/demand but still.. <br />
<br />
Sub/services price via gold is still going up.<br />
<br />
Services via gold are already over 100% more expensive on EU vs US, gold income in both games is 100% the same, US also got a better exchange rate as $15 can be divided by 3, and €13 can not.</div></div><hr />

Which is and always was more than what the US pays. It's not enough that our token is always almost double.</div></div><hr />

Ex of Character Transfer<br />
before : €20= 21.50US<br />
after: €25 = 26.95US<br />
<br />
price should be 25$ US. <br />
<br />
Here in Canada, we pay in $US all the time. So sometime it's cheaper, sometime it's more expensive!</div></div><hr />

It's not like we're already subscribed to cover costs like that.. oh wait<br />
<br />
There is no reason whatsoever that a &quot;Premium Mount&quot; should cost near the same as a AAA video game.</div></div><hr />

If the trend was to reverse and the Euro be worth more against the dollar, you can be guaranteed that you won't see a reversal in prices. The way of the world, we all lose!</div></div><hr />

Neither are you since you are using that as a justification for a roughly 5% increase in services and i say roughly since they aren't all going up by the same percentage, what tells us it has nothing to do with those things as actual reasoning behind it.</div></div><hr />

lol, maybe you don't know but there has been next to no change in exchange rates over the last year, Especially since the rate has fluctuated up and down to both a detriment and a benefit of Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
1.116 1 year ago<br />
1.078 Today<br />
<br />
3.5% change<br />
<br />
<br />
1.096 2 years ago<br />
1.078 Today<br />
<br />
1.6% change<br />
<br />
<br />
As of dec 2016 their year over year inflation rate was 1.1%, last two months it was 1.8%.<br />
<br />

Lots of things have gotten (way) cheaper than what they used to, because they can be made or provided both better and more efficient nowadays. Most of these wow-services have little to no cost involved today, where they once were a manual process. Yet their prices have gone up. That's the part that is upsetting people.<br />

<br />
And the level boost... holy shit, they have no shame. Guess making 800 million USD on a BAD year during WoD wasn't enough... <br />
<br />
<br />
People need to learn some basic economics.<br />
<br />
The price of services when entering the global market is adjusted for a few things, to name two:<br />
<br />
1) Inflation - as wages increase so too does the cost of goods and services over time<br />
<br />
2) Exchange Rates - Since Blizzard is a US company operating on a global scale, they must adjust their prices according to the exchange rates. If the Euro was much more powerful than the dollar in terms of buying power (which it was for several years) the prices would be lower in Euros for Blizzard services, since the Euro is not as powerful in terms of buying power as it used to be, it makes sense to adjust prices for that change.<br />
<br />
The same thing happens here in the US with inflation.</div></div><hr />

While hearthstone packs have separate prices in every eastern european and middle east currency, WOW doesn't, so they have all to live with the Euro conversion rate, and it's funny how in every token discussion there is &quot;that guy&quot; who says &quot;lululul I can work 1h longer and earn 20$ more&quot; while in some eastern EU countries you earn an equivalent of 200-300$ a month. Yes, the living cost is cheaper, but gaming isn't.

<br />
We have people in US that have avoided it forever as well because of the price. It's actually been cheaper for you guys recently since euro is alot closer to 1 usd now than it used to be. <br />
Now it's roughly the same soo...people who refused before will refuse now, and people who still buy them are giving blizz the same amount of money in the long haul...not more<br />
<br />
Also, blizz's refusal to address dead servers is an interesting concept to me...CRZ? Premade groups? Hell you can even do Mythic raids (once the next raid comes out) without being on the same server now. There could definitely be more done to actually help the dead servers but I don't see these things as a refusal to address it.</div></div><hr />

Because the $/Euro and $/£ ratio has only been going 1 way since 2008. That is complete obliteration in the strength of European currencies and the increased strength in the pound. There really has been no time since 2008 where there has been sustained strengthening of currencies in Europe which is why there's never been a time where a price drop would have kept the $ income to Blizzard the same.<br />
<br />
Also here's another thing about EVERY DAMN BUSINESS in the world. No amount of money is enough money, more is always better.</div></div><hr />

At this point I'm pretty sure sub prices would have gone up too if their PR team assured them they could get away with it.</div></div><hr />

Sub fees were raised in England during WoD.<br />
Also raising the price of character boost means raising the cost of future expansions, as they've already said expansions need to cost more than a character boost, else people would just create multiple bnet account, buy expac for their char then merged accounts and they don't want that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you wanted to have a boost this way you need to buy: <br />
- base battle chest <br />
- newest expansion <br />
- character transfer to your main account (to keep paying only 1 sub) <br />
<br />
So no, if you aren't an avid multiboxer it's not more efficient to buy extra licenses in the face of rising transfer costs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I actually used my WOD boost to &quot;recreate&quot; my DK stuck on some godforsaken realm, but I ended up regretting not having my &quot;real&quot; DK, with old non-obtainable anymore patterns, old reps I cba to regrind (like having these Ebon Blade DK guards in my garrison on WOD), some cool flavour items you no longer get etc. <br />
<br />
Such a waste of a &quot;free&quot; boost, should have boosted a class I didn't have. Ended up transfer-swapping these 2 to get the &quot;correct&quot; one on my main realm. Managed to snatch tokens for 164k, they're around 200k now and I expect them to rise, they already are since the announcement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The price of services when entering the global market is adjusted for a few things, to name two:<br />
<br />
1) Inflation - as wages increase so too does the cost of goods and services over time<br />
<br />
2) Exchange Rates - Since Blizzard is a US company operating on a global scale, they must adjust their prices according to the exchange rates. If the Euro was much more powerful than the dollar in terms of buying power (which it was for several years) the prices would be lower in Euros for Blizzard services, since the Euro is not as powerful in terms of buying power as it used to be, it makes sense to adjust prices for that change.<br />
<br />
The same thing happens here in the US with inflation.<br />
<br />
maybe you need to actually look at inflation before you post this huh?<br />
1.1% inflation year over year in the EU, some countries higher, a few negative.<br />
<br />
Exchange rates have basically been flat to a little higher. 3% for the year, 1.8% for two years.<br />
<br />
you are also talking about automated process that has had their original cost recoup'ed and easly pays for the service it must provide each year. there are no additional cost that would require such a large increase in prices.<br />
<br />

<br />
That's a pathetic excuse. These are virtual services / items that are unlimited in supply. That is why they can reduce the prices rather than putting them further up to fuck over the consumers. It would've been an alright move if the monthly sub was removed but that's not the case, hence why it shows that they no longer care about their users. <br />

please explain how a 1.8% increase in rate differentials over the last two years require increases of over 10%. When inflation is on average 1.1-2.1%.<br />

Uh... the prices they are changing to are right around US prices now.... doubt we'll see an increase, someone said earlier that with current rates (which have been dropping, not much longer and USD will Equal EURO) a realm transfer at 25 EURO is a whopping 26 USD.<br />
<br />
Aside from that, the fact they have never raised US Sub prices is kind of astounding as 15 bucks in 2004 is closer to 20 bucks in todays dollar</div></div><hr />

I`m guessing you not realised these things are cost literally nothing.

We've been paying these prices since the start in the US, and no one batted an eye. Are they high for what they are? Sure, but don't argue people won't pay because they will.<br />
<br />
For a long time the cost were about equal, but since at least 2015 the euro price has been less, surprised it took this long</div></div><hr />

<br />
In simple terms - pounds/euro converted to more dollars in the past...now they convert to less dollars so they need to raise prices in euro/pounds to compensate.<br />
<br />
No It does not make sense... We are Gamers. Normal People you know? The overwhelming Majority of Blizzard Customers doesnt have a Ferrari or own a House.... We already pay per Month increasing this is just a fucking scumbag Move by Blizzard... or should i say ACTIVISION ? Even more so when you realize how little they do for Dead Realms<br />

Can you like stop charging people over 50 bucks for like less than 200 cards In Hearthstone, over 50 bucks for an expansion on WoW, plus 13 euros sub per month for the privilage of being able to grind artifact power and legendaries? And then still suck at the game due to RNG screwing us over? No...? Cant we please do that and be consumer friendly?<br />
<br />
So far only Overwatch Is a fair price, what was It, 40 bucks? Or 30 for the game? And the crate drops are cosmetic so who cares, you can get them easily over time and with patience anyway. I'm getting the best value out of Overwatch so far</div></div><hr />

and customers have the right to both be upset and push back against price increases.<br />
in the end they also have the right to quit or not use services.<br />
they can even organize against the corporation to get them to back off the price increases.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">BrotherGriMM</div><div class="date">2017-03-23, 10:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So this is absolutely insane.. If they had really looked at the market they would have realized that these services are amongst the most expensive of any MMO running today. Whilst WoW is far more popular there are others that play Very well and are popular enough to keep going and expand (Such as Final Fantasy). To those claiming the subscription price is not going up.. well it went up in WoD (in the UK at least) making it the most expensive subscription going out of successful MMO's as well. Comparing the prices from WoW to FF - Sub price WoW £9.99 per month - FF £8.99. Race Change Wow (under new pricing) £19 - FF £5.75. <br />
<br />
Other service price difference is very similar. <br />
<br />
For a group with the resources that they have that claim to have done so much research.. they are really off point and even my 2 mins of google fu can see that. WoW sub count has been going down for a while and only occasionally gets spikes in subscribers whereas other games are gaining at a constant rate at the moment. When will companies learn that the way to combat reduction in player base is NOT to just jack up prices to compensate? You need to deliver a good product that players want at an affordable rate!</div></div><hr />

Grats! You now get to pay the same high price as us as opposed to paying less (respectively in terms of exchange rates)! Oh wait... the thing that EVERYONE has to pay? The sub fee? Yea, you still pay less, you basically get about a free month every year converting what you pay (12.99 eur) to usd (14.02 at current exchange rates), so really, fuck off, it may seem like a huge hike to you but its kinda nice seeing you get to pay just as much as us now for optional things.</div></div><hr />

I hope you're aware that local markets are different as well? Generally, Western &amp; Northern EU countries have higher income and sale taxes than US across the board. In addition to that, In Eastern and Southern Europe, wages are a fraction of what they are in the Western countries. For instance, I'd get paid 300 euros a month for the same job in Czech Republic vs the 2900 I get in Belgium. Living costs are also highly dependent on area and country.<br />
<br />
However, Blizzard services are the same across the board for all European Countries afaik. For some people that is practically unpayable. That's why other online retailers and service providers have adjusted pricing to accomodate for these countries. Because they know that despite having lower prices, they get higher profit margin because they attract more customers.</div></div><hr />

I mean, it sucks for them, but a business can't tailor its overall sub fees JUST because a country has lower wages, they can't be like, well, you know, people only make like 300 eur a month here so we can only charge them like 5 eur.<br />
<br />
Cost of living is all over the board in the US too, where I live, it's dirt cheap, living at minimum wage ain't too bad (i don't make min wage but that's besides the point), there's places you couldn't make min wage and live though.</div></div><hr />

They can. And they have. Go onto the steam store. You'll find that most games actually have region based pricing for Western and Eastern EU. Because you know, that is sensible.<br />
Not only that, not everyone in Europe uses Euro, so even for those citizens that don't, prices still fluctuate on a daily basis.<br />
<br />
But those are some of the reasons of the reasons why this price increase is a bad idea, from a business perspective. Not only does this price increase overall drive potential customers away, it'll make the service literally unpayable for a large group of players, and if they're not able to realm transfer off a dead realm, the chances they quit the game are increased. So not only are they losing out on potential transfer sales, they're also losing subs directly (people in protest) and indirectly because of this price increase.<br />
<br />
And I know that US living costs aren't the same across the board either. However, can you honestly say that living in Ohio and living in California literally has a 75-90% difference in terms of costs and wage? No, you cannot. It's not the same. Nevermind that, you also don't lose 40% of your wage to income taxes either. (altho, we do get a lot more social benefits for it).</div></div><hr />

Well good for those who do, you're not required to, and great, lower the prices for the eastern EU. But where wages and living costs are similar (Eastern EU for the EURO and GBP) pricing should be as similar as it can be, it hasn't been for years. Until this change someone was paying 20 USD for something that cost us 25 USD, and that's not right.</div></div><hr />

I don't see why you're cheering for a price increase for consumers. It's highly illogical. I can understand why you don't understand the peculiarities of EU economy. Not our fault that your currency has been run into the ground.</div></div><hr />

Our currencies are almost equal 1 EUR = 1.08 USD, whether that's the USD strengthening, or the euro faltering idk, but it's been like that since about 2015 with a slight boost last year. GBP is only 1 to 1.20ish now, its not like 1st world currency is that different right now. I'm not cheering that someone's price went up, I would have preferred ours went down, but there was zero reason for the pricing difference when eastern EU and US are THAT different in wages/living costs<br />
<br />
It almost seems like having a single currency for so many different countries was a bad idea...</div></div><hr />

Of course you don't pay just to cover the costs of the particular action. You pay for the fact that (A) it had to be implemented, which likely took a good amount of employees a long time, (B) it has to be maintained, because many of these services need to change whenever major content is released, (C) because a company needs to run a profit, which should come from wherever people are willing to pay for something and (D) because Blizzard doesn't want these things to be done too frequently, as it would mess with a lot of things if such services were free.<br />
<br />
You can wish everything was free, but development costs money and most companies exist to make a profit. You don't work for free either, so don't expect others to.<br />

Heh.. okay. Not that I'd ever use one of these but them prices are pretty f*** ridiculous for a program merely flipping a database value w/o human interaction.<br />
<br />
By that logic, you'd never pay a fee for, say, transferring / receiving money using Paypal. There are a TON of things in life you get charged for that are 100% automated without human interaction, but you pay for the service anyway. It had to be made, has to be maintained and is likely unique in what it provides. That's why you pay. It's no different with WoW.<br />
<br />
If you find the prices ridiculous, then just don't pay. The fact that the prices are this high, indicates that enough people are willing to pay that much. Simple as that.<br />

<br />
Has nothing to do with Blizzard. Merely with the fact that a lot of people here don't understand how running a business works. WoW isn't a static game that has been released X years ago, but a game that is constantly updated. So prices for anything can be expected to remain the same instead of dropping. that is, unless players simply don't want to pay that much anymore. If that were the case, Blizzard would drop to a more profitable, lower price.<br />
<br />
By your logic why would you have to pay for ANY online game or service if that game or service had turned a profit already? Businesses need profit. The more a company earns, the more it can do to expand and create new things. You cannot blame the company for sticking to an optimal pricing system. Literally every for-profit company out there does that.</div></div><hr />

I still think it's a greedy move, but the logic is there. No one is forcing anyone to buy this stuff, and maybe I don't understand how it works, but isn't there zero point in realm transfers and guild transfers now thanks to cross realm?</div></div><hr />

These are services that are (most of them at least) completely free on other MMOs yet they have the gall to even increase these prices because of what? These are automated digital services. They're literally worthless. This is such a disgusting move that I want to consider whether I still want to support any of their products.</div></div><hr />

total greed move, asking the prices of a full AAA title for basic and fully automated services that cost them a tiny fraction of what they are reeking in as profit.</div></div><hr />

it's greedy to raise EU instead of lowering NA, but they've had this model for years so they won't just change it like that sadly.<br />

if eu really wants to protest this, then protest the price lowering for NA too.</div></div><hr />

No need to make this an EU vs NA issue. I think no one wants to pay more than a few bucks for these services. In my opinion they should just have a small fee so you wouldn't use these services all the time. But look at these prices... It's ridiculous. 60 € for a character boost? No thanks. I'd rather invite my family for dinner.<br />
Greedy companies like Blizzard are complete cancer. They possess no talent or originality but they do possess the audacity to make sure that everyone is paying insane amounts of money for their mediocre products.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have no idea how economics work right?<br />
<br />
First and foremost, the overal sallery in some of the countries affected by this is prob half the sallery that US ppl have.<br />
And above that this is automated services. Costs Blizzard nothing to keep this up compared to other stuff in this game.<br />
Sure this would have been ok if you got a few transfers for free but this isnt the case.<br />
<br />
Nah this is a greed move and it reflects badly on Blizzard. Just cause 1$ ~= 1£ does not mean the prices should be the same. <br />
Its when sallery + cost of living = salley + cost of living in 2 countries THEN the price for this should be the same in those 2 countries. EU aint a country, and several of the eastern countries mean sallery is so low that this really hits them hard.<br />
<br />
Nah if anything this is services that should be free. Atleast character transfers/faction changes and other stuff that actually help ppl to keep playing. I dont care if mounts costs since they are just superficial and is only for fun. But having to pay for 10 chars to move to another server is just stupid.</div></div><hr />

No but I am familiar with greed and not being able to justify these price increases on services they probably have a 3000% profit margin on. Lol, gtfo of here with your inflation. <br />
<br />
Have fun everyone with paying a full AAA title price to skip half of the game. Thank all the people who didn't care back when they started with all these shady practices because &quot;it's optional&quot; or &quot;it's not pay2win&quot;. They will be tweaking these systems over and over to make more and more money and it will negatively impact you even if you don't buy their services or cosmetic items. The game market is going to shit.</div></div><hr />

So just as I suspected. This is just pure economic ignorance. It's pure supply and demand buddy. It's a luxury service that you don't need any have no reason to buy other than to not play the game in the first place. If you don't like it, you're under no obligation to pay for it. But no, nebulously blaming things you don't like on &quot;greed&quot; because you baselessly feel you're entitled to them is totally rational behavior...<br />

Actually I do. Financial analysis and quarterly price adjustment on services was literally my job for 4 years. It's all supply and demand with a little bit of adjustment for exchange rates, taxes, etc thrown in. If you don't like the price, don't buy it. There's nothing &quot;greedy&quot; about selling a completely optional luxury service for a price that disincentivizes people from just using it flippantly.</div></div><hr />

Businesses need profit. The more a company earns, the more it can do to expand and create new things. You cannot blame the company for sticking to an optimal pricing system. Literally every for-profit company out there does that.<br />
<br />
I cannot? Why? If anything I did expect prices to be lowered, not raised. I don't understand why anyone would advocate for raising prices is 'normal'. Please don't feed me that inflation crap answer. Again, these are digital goods, not real world manufacturing. There is absolutely nothing stopping Blizz from lowering instead of raising prices.. the only reason is they want to squeeze more money from the service. I am not a lemon, I don't like to be squeezed.<br />
<br />
I fully understand Blizzard is not a charity organization and Activision always wants more but sometimes less is more.</div></div><hr />

Inflation and exchange rates are irrelevant for made up prices of digital services that cost Blizzard next to nothing. They aren't exactly losing money on this. Supply and demand? Yes. Also completely made up prices where they milk their customers just because they can, with &quot;exchange rates&quot; as excuse? Also yes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In other markets like consumer electronics (e.g. digital cameras, personal computers) where number of units sold are declining and market size is shrinking, companies like Sony and Apple have resorted to significant price hikes (Sony's ILC, Apple's MBP line) in order to maintain revenue numbers.<br />

<br />
Ofc not. My country had the food VAT lowered from 21% to 9%. You'd expect to see some changes, yet restaurants have the same prices and the big food stores only advertised price lowering(maybe reduced it for a small period) and then went back to regular price. The difference goes in their pocket ofc...</div></div><hr />

When people pirate the next piece of software you make I wont cry then. Everything they get to do with it will generally be offline and thus require no man power from anyone and your company will most likely make a profit still, you wouldn't want to be greedy would you.</div></div><hr />

So any piece of complete software he does deserves to be pirated because it's offline (for some reason, don't know where you got that part) and you're comparing it to something like transferring a character that can literally be done with 5 lines of code... yup, you're completely right....</div></div><hr />

Yes, exactly. They are adjusting for conversion. The lower the value of the euro, the less money Blizzard makes from each transcation conducted in euros.<br />
<br />
The euro is currently worth about $0.30 USD less than it was a couple years ago. Two years ago, a €20 mount earned Blizzard about $26 USD. Now it earns them only $21 USD. On NA servers those mounts are $25 USD. The new €25 price means they'll get $27 USD on those transactions, only slightly higher than the NA price.<br />
<br />
You see the issue?<br />
<br />
When the value of the euro goes down, Blizzard makes less money from the EU servers. So they increase prices on EU servers. It's not rocket science.</div></div><hr />

With his logic yes, in real life no.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kathranis</div><div class="date">2017-03-26, 03:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone want to guess here?<br />
The value of the euro has dropped by about $.30 USD in the last couple years.<br />
<br />
What that means in practical terms is that a store mount ($25 on NA) which was being sold for €20 on EU (about $26 USD) is now only worth about $21 USD. In other words, Blizzard is making $5 less on every store mount sold on EU in 2017 than they did in 2014.<br />
<br />
The new EU price, €25, is $27 USD, slightly higher than the NA list price of $25 USD. Obviously there's also the whole &quot;24.99&quot; marketing thing, rather than a more direct conversion rate (which would be like $23.12), which means there's always going to be some &quot;rounding up&quot; going on in these price changes.<br />
<br />
Of course many (if not most) states in the US also have an additional sales tax that is added to the price during checkout, which I don't believe is the case with EU's VAT (correct me if I'm wrong).<br />
<br />
Here in Texas, a $25 store mount comes to a total of about $29.12 USD at checkout, which is still a couple bucks more expensive than the new EU price. (In other words, in Texas a store mount costs €26.94, vs EU's €25).</div></div><hr />

Yes that's exactly what they are doing. Trying to bring European prices into line with American prices (where everything costs more because people earn more) is nothing more than a cash grab designed to extort more money from customers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually it's not irrelevant at all. Inflation and exchange rates set the demand curve for the item. That affects not only the variable profit for each transaction but the buy rates, etc. Blizzard can not only affect what they make off this completely optional luxury service and make adjustments to maintain their current earnings, but they can also make adjustments to influence how often those services are used, which is relevant to the larger gameplay environment. Transfers, faction changes, boosts all affect the relative stability of the player population on various servers and thus the player experience. Adjusting the price of a completely optional feature that is in no way necessary or advantageous to keep pace with economic factors helps them preserve the status quo they've set or adjust it as needed. <br />
<br />
I get why you don't want to deal with that. Blaming abstract concepts like greed as an mask for entitlement is easier and feels better.</div></div><hr />
