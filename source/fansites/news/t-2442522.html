Because the development time to fix the major vanilla bugs/exploits using the original code is less than adapting Classic to the more Modern client. Plus, improvements such as Colorbind Mode (as they mentioned in the Watercooler) would take FOREVER to code into the 1.12 engine</div></div><hr />

In a past interview they said that they'd need to build the game from the ground up but....what if they used the original cds out there to simply pull the files off them instead of having to rebuild the game OR gut down the current game down. I'm not a game developer so idk which would be the easier route. I just feel using the original retail discs would give the best &quot;Vanilla means Vanilla&quot; experience</div></div><hr />

Anyone who works in software development would understand it's not that straight forward. But if you don't, it's too elaborate to even get into it. But trust me it's not that simple.</div></div><hr />

if they stick to their Vanilla means vanilla quote then colorblind mode along with plenty of quality of life improvements to the game shouldn't be in the game</div></div><hr />

But that's what made the game so much more difficult! Having to wait for re-spawns or be forced to socialize and group up in leveling quests/zones or go solo and fight for each individual mob and collection item.</div></div><hr />

<br />
At this point the only QOL changes that are confirmed are the automated reporting system, Full Battle.Net integration, Colorblind mode, and improved Widescreen Formatting.<br />
<br />
None of these directly affect the &quot;Vanilla is Vanilla&quot; gameplay quote. You will still have to wait 5 seconds to start regenning mana. You will still have to feed your kitty or it'll run away. You'll still have to stance dance on Magmadar cause your guild's Dwarf Priest didn't show up.</div></div><hr />

well if they're going with that route then I can see where simply gutting the current game would make sense. also if they add too many QOL changes down the road, its gonna backfire on them. they'd be better off simply adding original Naxx into the current game and letting lvl 60 guilds tackle it as &quot;current&quot; content</div></div><hr />

But if you don't, it's too elaborate to even get into it. But trust me it's not that simple.<br />
<br />
<br />
i wouldn't say its too complicated to explain....<br />
<br />
The CD's are not containing everything which makes world of warcraft work.<br />
<br />
In modern software development- especially if you build for the masses - you have a server / client system.<br />
<br />
That is : all home PCs connect to one server (your realm) and the server cares for syncing and distributing the right information at the right time to the other people playing beside you.<br />
<br />
Now the code for the server is NOT on the CD's.<br />
if it was it would be super easy to setup your own server and then dont pay for the subscription.<br />
<br />
Lets put that aside however.<br />
<br />
Now that we straightend this out we come to the second part:<br />
<br />
The big problem with setting up the server for classic is that the old code from back in the days does not run on newer computers/servers it basically only runs on the old server hardware which was partially up for sale on ebay. It was completly not available to blizzard anymore.<br />
Only by buying such a server from the new owner they were able to manage to get it back up and running.<br />
<br />
They could have released that - but that would include getting back all the servers they previously sold (or many of them)<br />
additionally they have listed concerns that the old server software has its downsides - its not technologically as advanced as the servers are today. so you get back all the troubles they had in the past with the servers.<br />
<br />
Thats when they decided to completly rewrite the server side to use the current technology and tailor classic on top of it.<br />
<br />
And thats basically a lot of work :)</div></div><hr />

Not sure what that means though<br />
<br />

chaud maybe you could see if there's any strings in the files about the subscription model? I assumed it'd be something like with an active retail sub or $10 without one probably not in the demo strings though. Or anything about how they're going to unlock raids</div></div><hr />

The CD's are not containing everything which makes world of warcraft work.<br />
<br />
First of all; nowhere did I state that and that's part of the reason why I wrote what I wrote.<br />
Judging by your reaction you don't work in software development because you clearly didn't mention any of the complications I was refering too.<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't some private server company, they are a company that keeps going forward and doesn't meddle with old releases, up until now that is.<br />
If you don't know what you're talking about, don't bother trying to correct someone.</div></div><hr />

because those disks literally have nothing more then the models and textures...<br />

literally the only thing you are downloading is a fuck ton of pictures, and a fuck ton of files telling the game how ot put those pictures together.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because not all the info needed is stored on the discs. Some (I'd even say a good portion) of the data is fetched from the servers and all that data needs to be scripted, unless you want the game to run like a private server, with bosses having just basic attacks that hit like a truck to make up for the lack of other behaviours. A lot of that data needs to be rewritten because the game has changed so much, they had no need for it anymore, and that can take a long time, especially if you're trying to stay true to the original AND fix the bugs it had at the same time.<br />
<br />
Hope that clears it up.</div></div><hr />

Most certainly, can't wait for all the waves of tears especially those who started playing from Cataclysm on, try out classic/vanilla for the first time and realize it is not what they thought it was going to be..

You want to be able to boot into the game right? You know how far technology has come since 2004? You cant just copy and paste 14 year old code and expect it to work flawlessly. Not to mention what everyone else has said.<br />

Boot people out every once in awhile or wait in a endless queue? Also they make people buy it to limit the amount of people in the queue, if it were free you would end up with the same issue. A endless queue.</div></div><hr />

Assuming a mob with such a large hp pool exists in the wilds of westfall/barrens to test it (as there is no dungeon bosses to test it on), why would it matter if it's not the case? It not being on the demo is not indicative of it being on live or not one way or the other.</div></div><hr />

Well you're wrong in a fundamental way here. If you were designing a demo, and the key word is DEMO, why would you bother to implement something that in no way effects the demo whatsoever? Like, I get that the hardcore enthusiasts want everything down the last blade of grass spot on, but for a DEMO you don't really need things that only really affect end game material because you and I both know, most of these mobs are not living long enough to get debuff capped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If I was designing a demo, I'd take a stable build 2-3 builds behind the cutting edge, and then refine it for the demo. Not set up a brand new version of the project specifically for a week-long demo.<br />
<br />
The game will have things that are not relevant to the actual demo itself, like the string for meeting stones, when there are already confirmed to be no dungeons active. If the debuff limit has already been modified in their production, it could very well be in its intended classic form in the demo.</div></div><hr />

Guess it's gonna be a while without a full team working on it. At least they have the old code; and I assume at least 1 working old server somewhere in a closet.</div></div><hr />

Judging by your reaction you don't work in software development because you clearly didn't mention any of the complications I was refering too.<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't some private server company, they are a company that keeps going forward and doesn't meddle with old releases, up until now that is.<br />
If you don't know what you're talking about, don't bother trying to correct someone.<br />
<br />
I just quoted the wrong guy dude, you quoted someone who said that the CDs are all whats needed and i wrongly said you were wrong. sorry bout that.<br />
<br />
However i must say iam working as a senior software developer in some bigger company you might just know so i think i am well qualified to explain the scenario.<br />
<br />
You said i did not refer to any of the complications mentioned by you.<br />
<br />
Here is what you wrote : <br />
&quot;Anyone who works in software development would understand it's not that straight forward. But if you don't, it's too elaborate to even get into it. But trust me it's not that simple.&quot;<br />
<br />
Please tell me : How is mentioning &quot;its too elaborate&quot; in anyway outlining any complications?<br />

So basically the same thing people like you have been saying for what, 7 years now? That the people playing on classic Pservers all these years aren't actually enjoying the game they are playing, they are just.... confused. And that they don't really want what they want they are just.... confused.<br />
<br />
&quot;You think you do but you don't; even though you are playing classic servers.... you don't&quot;<br />
<br />
Not even Blizzard is sticking to THAT old song. But I suspect you guys will still be saying this even as people are playing and raiding BWL/AQ and Naxx. Some people just have a hard time understanding how someone could enjoy something that they don't.</div></div><hr />

dungeon stones always worked as they intended to, where as the debuff limit was due to limitations and wasn't intentional. This time around they would have to go out of their way to make sure it intentionally works that way and theres a good chance they haven't actually finished the part of the complete product where that limit would matter, aka the endgame. I'm not saying it's not going to be there, I'm not saying it will either. I just can't imagine anything less important for a short leveling period than a debuff cap.</div></div><hr />

Dungeon stones were changed to summon. Them doing LFG is a revert to old meeting stone behavior.<br />
<br />
Like I said, I'm not saying that they added the debuff cap in for the demo, but that the demo is 100% just a build version they pulled from internal development, so it has features from that development that are unrelated to the demo, like the stone revert or potentially changes to debuff limit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends on how many &quot;servers&quot; are handling the classic demo. Because if it's just 1 server, even if it's a mere 8000 players, it's going to be overloaded for absolute certain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well we have to hope they have enough capacity. And they have no reason not to have that capacity, they know how many convention systems and virtual tickets they have sold so they know the maximum number of people who could be trying to log into the demo.<br />
<br />
Hopefully they meet the challenge.</div></div><hr />

Have you ever noticed many of the games from 2004 that you have on disk doesn't work now? That's why they have to rebuild it for today's technology.<br />

They also don't just want to release the same buggy and shitty game from 2004, they want to keep what makes it special and polish it. They don't want to be just another classic private server.<br />
<br />
<br />
What utter rubbish, the original classic client from 1.12 still works flawlessly on modern systems. Its even better than the modern client is some ways, you know with TRUE FULLSCREEN SUPPORT , opengl etc etc.</div></div><hr />

Lots of people are going to end up in a queue, and of course they will then go to the forums to complain. It will be particularly bad if those on the convention floor are stuck in a queue, unless there is some kind of priority system to ensure they get in when required.<br />
<br />
Are you sure the convention floor will be connected to the proper internet? I always thought they set up some intranet for that, or heck even LAN. Tech wiz people can do such things I think.</div></div><hr />

It seems to me you have never launched your &quot;flawless&quot; 1.12, otherwise you would have surely noticed how SHITTY it runs. Like for example the ever present micro stuttering due to frame-rate / hertz inconsistencies that makes it (at least for me) completely unplayable on private servers without wanting to carve your eyes out after 5 minutes of play.</div></div><hr />

It will have new things, it will have changes. It must. Any major or minor change is something that Blizzard traditionally has represented with a number going up or a letter added to the end. <br />
<br />
In vanilla, what constituted the threshold for what is now considered a content patch was much smaller than it is now. <br />
1.13 makes sense. It is not a balance patch, it is not a content patch. It is a systems patch. They added colour blind mode and battle-net integration. That alone is worthy of the patch number increase.</div></div><hr />

First off, 1.12 was a pretty short lived patch. Only people playing private servers have that large sentimental attachment to the specific patch number. Thinking of it like if it was Counter Strike 1.6 or something.<br />
<br />
Second off, they have changed a bunch of things. Brought in much of the Live front-end as well as ability to communicate with the modern back-end. It might be 1.12 in gameplay and feature set (so don't freak out?) but technically it's gone through quite a list of changes to even work, so bumping the version number by one decimal makes sense. <br />

You should be excited that they have made a new 1.X build. From the programmers' perspective there's now officially a new life line for Vanilla WoW.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but Blizz could have used &quot;1.1a&quot; or similar as a patch number and started Classic from vanilla's beginning patch timeline with the added api goodies, but because they have passed the original 12 patches of vanilla, I will continue to think of Classic as Classic and not as vanilla, just &quot;vanilla-ish&quot; as 1.13 is kind of heading into TBC not vanilla in my WoW personal canonical timeline.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you, as if Classic or post-BFA WoW doesn't do as well as Blizzard might expect, years of from now of course, then WoW 2.0 will probably be Blizzard's best hope to continue WoW and still appeal to the masses and new generations of players.</div></div><hr />

How is investing in a dev team for 2+ years time &quot;$&quot; if all you care is that you want vanilla wow with bugs? Seems to me they could've cheaped out, grabbed the compiled 1.12 from a torrent and bought the Nostalrius server code in that case.<br />

It's nice that some agreement can be achieved at MMO-Champion. But it doesn't matter, I'm just one player. What does matter is that if I can think that, others will too, and they might be more devoted to WoW than me and really screech about it. It's not that important to me at the end of the day, I started as a hard core raider but ended up barely a casual, but the die hards could really kick off about the patch number. I will wait and see over time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Things go forward. It is very clear that everyone envision and want something else when they think of the vanilla experience, and everyone has something different they think was the downside of vanilla. <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't consider call the current iteration of World of Warcraft &quot;Wow&quot;, I call it &quot;BFA&quot;. It is a new game for me and it is not wow, in the same vein you consider wow classic &quot;classic&quot;<br />
<br />
They already, a fair time ago, expressed their desire to go along with &quot;basing the game off of 1.12&quot; and this is what they are doing. Some things will have to adapt themselves. This is inevitable.<br />
Why do they put themselves at this patch? Because from a developer's point of view, they feel less constrained by this. Imagine if they were forced to patch into the balance changes if they started at 1.1. Imagine the constraint and the iterativeness feeling of that. From 1.13, they are less locked in.<br />
Will Vanilla evolve from there or be frozen in time? Who knows. I would not mind seeing it evolve, because that is not the aspect of vanilla wow that would be ruined for me. I am aware not everyone shares this. Yes, I would welcome new content but not new expansions per say. I want to play an MMORPG again. I want that MMORPG to be wow. I want that self contained system to carry on, maybe through new content, but not evolve the system which I think they hit the nail on from the get go. Even though I did naxxramas in Vanilla proper (up until and including entire plague wing, spider and construct wings at least) I do not consider it part of the vanilla wow I remember and therefore I would accept more similar raids beyond naxxramas in wow classic. <br />
I have never cared about the content. As long as they don't mess with the core functionality and punishing/reward system they had. That is vanilla to me. And also not something I expect, since I more expect it to be a frozen in time project. <br />
Just wanted to say that I understood that people want/are open to different things and show that everyone thinks of vanilla completely differently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Good - those were the awful things about Classic. Funny in hindsight, but was a pain in the ass - for example, when the boat you were taking randomly became lodged in the side of Alterac Mountains causing you not to move or perform any action that would end up taking (sometimes) a few hours to resolve because a GM had to port you out - meaning that whether it was on weekday evenings or a weekend day, that was part of the day wasted that you had to play WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your answer does not exactly fit his comment I think.<br />
The client of private servers is strictly the same Blizzard had at the time. The server is emulated.<br />
A scenario where Blizzard provides its own updated server, but use the same 1.12.1 client would have been technically possible. Not ideal, but possible.<br />
<br />
Updating the client was just a really good strategy to reuse existing modern server software and at the same time fix client-side problems/incompatibilities.</div></div><hr />

I did consider it to check out Classic, but the $50 price tag and not even an in-game mount reward this year was a definite no from me. While it's cool they're letting home viewers join in on the demo action, their decision to limit the availability of the demo to BlizzCon week AND their recent announcement that even your time to play during said week will be restricted, is absurd.<br />
<br />
The game is obviously not ready and they don't want people to have infinite time with it.. so they need to put harsh restrictions in place.</div></div><hr />

It is very clear that everyone envision and want something else when they think of the vanilla experience, and everyone has something different they think was the downside of vanilla. <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't consider call the current iteration of World of Warcraft &quot;Wow&quot;, I call it &quot;BFA&quot;. It is a new game for me and it is not wow, in the same vein you consider wow classic &quot;classic&quot;<br />
<br />
They already, a fair time ago, expressed their desire to go along with &quot;basing the game off of 1.12&quot; and this is what they are doing. Some things will have to adapt themselves. This is inevitable.<br />
Why do they put themselves at this patch? Because from a developer's point of view, they feel less constrained by this. Imagine if they were forced to patch into the balance changes if they started at 1.1. Imagine the constraint and the iterativeness feeling of that. From 1.13, they are less locked in.<br />
Will Vanilla evolve from there or be frozen in time? Who knows. I would not mind seeing it evolve, because that is not the aspect of vanilla wow that would be ruined for me. I am aware not everyone shares this. Yes, I would welcome new content but not new expansions per say. I want to play an MMORPG again. I want that MMORPG to be wow. I want that self contained system to carry on, maybe through new content, but not evolve the system which I think they hit the nail on from the get go. Even though I did naxxramas in Vanilla proper (up until and including entire plague wing, spider and construct wings at least) I do not consider it part of the vanilla wow I remember and therefore I would accept more similar raids beyond naxxramas in wow classic. <br />
I have never cared about the content. As long as they don't mess with the core functionality and punishing/reward system they had. That is vanilla to me. And also not something I expect, since I more expect it to be a frozen in time project. <br />
Just wanted to say that I understood that people want/are open to different things and show that everyone thinks of vanilla completely differently.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your well thought out reply. Yes horses for courses indeed about vanilla interpretation, one persons drink is another person's poison and so on. I think I will wait to see how the hardcore WoW players handle it, I feel there might be some explody moments, or maybe there won't be over the patch number. I'm not hard core anymore but I used to be earlier on in WoW's timeline. I just did some PvP arena's and BG's rather than raids in the end over time and barely do anything else other than cursory casual play. I'm going to wait and see what the hardcore WoW veteran's make of it from a relaxed distance. I will still think of Classic as vanilla-ish instead of vanilla at the end of the day.</div></div><hr />

No, but people that are actually at Blizzcon have always had time restrains so people don't sit there all day with queues becoming unmanagable or people not being able to play. It also makes sense for this to apply to people that get to play at home, as it allows the servers to not be fxcking overloaded to death.<br />

This such a narrow-minded answer. You are projecting your own wants and desires upon others. <br />

Even if they made that stuff possible though, it wouldn't feel the same because I already lived through those experiences and all of the mystery is gone.<br />

Good news is that the FPS cap options from Legion are still in the menus, so you can set your game's maximum foreground FPS to 3, and then you mimic how it was to move around in Ironforge in Vanilla WoW.<br />

You can run 1.12 on win 10. At most you run it in compatibility mode. You only have to change your realmlist if you are running a emulator or doing stuff that violates fair use/today.</div></div><hr />

It is not, however, how Blizzard is intending it. It is something that is included in the Blizzcon experience and therefore an addition to the virtual ticket. More value added. Of course, some people will pay purely for this, but it is not the intent of the inclusion. It's a demo, not a game. <br />
Personally I wouldn't pay for a virtual ticket no matter the rewards, but it is not difficult for me to see others' pov.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but: what would it matter if people could use new models as long as you can disable them. There is already a classic-setting in the graphics, so what would it matter if people can personally enable them? The same as the a win in bullshit-bingo: &quot;Somebody complain about colorblind-mode&quot; is always a guaranteed hit. Sorry, but that's simply stupid, complaining about features that doesn't impact gameplay at all, especially your personal.<br />
<br />
Because even if people play with the new models for example: as long as you disable them, it doesn't affect you at all. So it's purely complaining because of complaining, the same as colorblind-mode.<br />
<br />
And you can be sure they don't use the old client. It's so buggy, INSECURE and NO 64 bit-client or DirectX 11. (wasn't classic even directx 8)</div></div><hr />

They aren't going to support Windows XP/Vista and 32 bit when they just dropped support for it. Not to mention doing so would create impossible to fix security flaws as XP is not even supported by MS anymore.<br />
<br />
And in what universe would they develop the client for that extreme minority? Yes it's a small minority that use XP nowadays.<br />
<br />
Even Steam is dropping support for XP starting 2019. One of the biggest gaming platforms out there.<br />
<br />
As I said back in the WoW threads for when they dropped 32 bit. If you are still running a 32 bit machine for &quot;gaming&quot; then you feel free to. Just don't whine when technology moves forward and leaves you behind.</div></div><hr />

The point of savagery in that post resides in the fact that the button you talk about is read 'Cinematics' instead of 'Cinematic' without 's'. But I am happy that is clarified to you, so now you as well can have some fun. All the best. :)</div></div><hr />

There is already a classic-setting in the graphics, so what would it matter if people can personally enable them? The same as the a win in bullshit-bingo: &quot;Somebody complain about colorblind-mode&quot; is always a guaranteed hit. Sorry, but that's simply stupid, complaining about features that doesn't impact gameplay at all, especially your personal.<br />
<br />
Because even if people play with the new models for example: as long as you disable them, it doesn't affect you at all. So it's purely complaining because of complaining, the same as colorblind-mode.<br />
<br />
And you can be sure they don't use the old client. It's so buggy, INSECURE and NO 64 bit-client or DirectX 11. (wasn't classic even directx 8)<br />

Technically it is not which is why they are usually ok with it. A model swap on retail is done through a runtime memory modification. As long as the client for classic is the same you should be able to get the new models in the same way. It may get trickier if the client for classic is different and doesn't allocate the same model files.</div></div><hr />

Ah, okay. Yeah, if a modification has gameplay effects, you'll probably get banned. Otherwise, generally safe-ish in the past. The '-ish' part is why I've never bothered with it myself (I care about my account slightly too much to risk stuff), but there are entire communities of people who do.</div></div><hr />

It uses the current games engine, so most likely they have yet to change that. Think of it as this, they are porting vanilla, to the new engine. So that cinematics button is most likely something leftover and will simply have the s removed.</div></div><hr />

I play private servers, and I'm not subbed to retail currently. The moment classic drops, I'm dropping 15/month again if needed. And plenty of others are with me, mostly because private servers (and all your stuff) can always go away, at any moment, be it due to Blizzard or the servers own staff. Official Blizzard servers will be around for a long time. EQ1 is still going and getting expansions, WoW can last a long, long time. And seriously, 15/month is not an amount anyone with a PC and internet should be worrying about. I might even go 6 month just to make it cheaper.<br />

Currently playing retail, but also looking forward to Classic. Because both games are going to offer an entirely different experience.<br />

Honestly it feels that person is just trolling based on the &quot;hope the CEO comes out and says canceled lol&quot; bit.<br />
<br />
I don't doubt there are those who kept trolling &quot;walls of no&quot; at people wanting vanilla, upset that it's becoming realized. Such is the case with those who are petty.</div></div><hr />

Yes horses for courses indeed about vanilla interpretation, one persons drink is another person's poison and so on. I think I will wait to see how the hardcore WoW players handle it, I feel there might be some explody moments, or maybe there won't be over the patch number. I'm not hard core anymore but I used to be earlier on in WoW's timeline. I just did some PvP arena's and BG's rather than raids in the end over time and barely do anything else other than cursory casual play. I'm going to wait and see what the hardcore WoW veteran's make of it from a relaxed distance. I will still think of Classic as vanilla-ish instead of vanilla at the end of the day.<br />
<br />
You're free to think of it any way you want, but whether they start at patch 1.12 or 1.1 it's still vanilla WoW, before any expansions came out. Tell me, which of the interim patch changes ruin that vanilla experience for you? The one where they added party-wide buffs? The removal of resource costs for taunts? AoE targeting circles no longer disappearing when you move? Not having to manually resume attacking as a Warrior using Slam? Other than the new content like dungeons and raids, there wasn't THAT massive a difference in the pre-BC patches.</div></div><hr />

Back in the day I had a texture mod that allowed me to go under the Arathi BG starting gate. We would go to Blacksmith before the BG even started so we could cap it immediately. A few in my guild also had a client texture mod that let you go straight to the bosses you wanted in Stratholme skipping all of the trash and gates.<br />
<br />
I am pretty sure shenanigans like that won't be a thing in Classic and that is a good thing. Vanilla was super exploitable which is not a good thing. If you seriously want OG Vanilla because you miss how easy it was to exploit... well... you are a idiot. No software vendor is going to release a product with 14 year old bugs in it.<br />

If your WoW fun only came from exploiting garbage in Vanilla then I guess WoW isn't the game for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nostalgia might be a false narrative for you and some others, but it's not for everyone. I have nostalgia for many, many old games and when I go play them either the mechanics or the graphics turn me off. <br />
<br />
Like I play any game from 2010 and earlier (excluding WoW) and I just can't do it, no matter how fond my memories are. <br />
<br />
I bought the Super Nintendo Classic and played 15-30 minutes before boxing it up and letting it collect dust. My nostalgia for that era of gaming was far greater than my tolerance for outdated graphics and old mechanics. <br />
<br />
So for me, nostalgia is very real and I expect going back to Classic will be fun for ME for a week, maybe a month at the most, before I go back to Retail. I could be wrong, but I'm just sharing that nostalgia is real for SOME people (even if not you) when it comes to Classic. <br />
<br />
I hope I'm wrong about Classic and I find I love leveling alts in Classic way more than Retail. But maybe it's me being a filthy millenial or something - I don't see myself loving Classic more than Retail.</div></div><hr />

They exist though, so it would literally just be a matter of copying the animations and models into the game like they are now i.e. in that we have the option to turn new models off. It would just work in reverse, i.e. having the option to enable new models.</div></div><hr />

Classic is so hilarious. So many people are talking about 'how great it was' and they are just lying (i.e. they didn't play vanilla) or they've completely forgotten how things worked in vanilla. Like this guy that thinks quest item drops were shared. Lolololol....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because, it seems pretty obvious they have limited server space for the game, and don't want to have it fry it's silicon brain dealing with a huge flood of people. This is a DEMO, not a fully completed game running off dedicated servers. That's in the future. It's two zones, and what, 4 levels of play? It's not a big deal, you're not missing out on any bragging rights here. This isn't something that people need to play more than a couple hours max. <br />
<br />
And, it's on the floor at their convention. Priority will 100% be for them, because they paid way more than you did, to get access, and they don't want people getting &quot;server is full&quot; on the floor of Blizzcon, with the press there. And, they're not going to allow people to sit there for the length of Blizzcon, grinding boars in Westfall for hours every day. <br />
<br />
I hate to use the word, but the entitlement over this is hilarious. You don't get a toy, unless you pay for it. Sorry.<br />

I was expecting a complete overhaul of the graphics, i mean keep them the same but crank up the quality to a bfa level, with some new models etc<br />
Classic was a good time, it was new and fun back then but ... it will just backfire now if it's left like this, it's a good chance for the developers to start fresh. <br />
A lot of people cheering for this leave me the impression that they never played it, or played on a private server where they could do some strange things, man a lot of them will be hit hard when starting this game :))<br />
<br />
This isn't a reboot of Warcraft, was never intended to be, or stated to be. A fresh start? No. It was never about that.</div></div><hr />

People think Classic was the pinnacle of wow, but in reality BC and Wrath were. More people raiding, more people in comp pvp, more 5 mans, more interesting fights, as well as all classes having some form of viability in a raid setting. Progression felt meaningful and gearing was a bit more straight forward, that didn't require level 30-35 sets for one boss at 60. Classic was a great gate way into Azeroth, it was a casual approach to EQ and Ultima, its community aspects were fantastic, but as a game it was trash, BC gave players more choice and opportunity and was just hands down better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBC was patch 2.0.1 They never released a 1.13, the last patch of vanilla was 1.12.2, which was a minor bugfix.<br />
<br />
http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Patch_1.12.0<br />
<br />
The first patch of TBC, 2.0.1 reset talent points. 2.0.3 was TBC in full, when Dark Portal opened.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Yeah fuck no.... also you have no idea how exploitable the 1.12 Client is. All These chinese Gold sellers are abusing the Client to send faulty server requests so they can spam create new characters<br />
<br />
The new client is part of battle.net. They rebuilt the client so the same protections will be there, that exist for the game now.<br />
<br />
I have no doubt that crowd is licking their chops and getting ready to figure out how to slime their way in, but it's not going to be like 2004, security-wise.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Things go forward. It is very clear that everyone envision and want something else when they think of the vanilla experience, and everyone has something different they think was the downside of vanilla. <br />
<br />
Personally, I don't consider call the current iteration of World of Warcraft &quot;Wow&quot;, I call it &quot;BFA&quot;. It is a new game for me and it is not wow, in the same vein you consider wow classic &quot;classic&quot;<br />
<br />
They already, a fair time ago, expressed their desire to go along with &quot;basing the game off of 1.12&quot; and this is what they are doing. Some things will have to adapt themselves. This is inevitable.<br />
Why do they put themselves at this patch? Because from a developer's point of view, they feel less constrained by this. Imagine if they were forced to patch into the balance changes if they started at 1.1. Imagine the constraint and the iterativeness feeling of that. From 1.13, they are less locked in.<br />
Will Vanilla evolve from there or be frozen in time? Who knows. I would not mind seeing it evolve, because that is not the aspect of vanilla wow that would be ruined for me. I am aware not everyone shares this. Yes, I would welcome new content but not new expansions per say. I want to play an MMORPG again. I want that MMORPG to be wow. I want that self contained system to carry on, maybe through new content, but not evolve the system which I think they hit the nail on from the get go. Even though I did naxxramas in Vanilla proper (up until and including entire plague wing, spider and construct wings at least) I do not consider it part of the vanilla wow I remember and therefore I would accept more similar raids beyond naxxramas in wow classic. <br />
I have never cared about the content. As long as they don't mess with the core functionality and punishing/reward system they had. That is vanilla to me. And also not something I expect, since I more expect it to be a frozen in time project. <br />
Just wanted to say that I understood that people want/are open to different things and show that everyone thinks of vanilla completely differently.<br />
<br />
The most relevant reason to go with the final content patch is the game had everything implemented that defines 'classic&quot; - all the raids, all the dungeons, all the pvp systems. (Even though AV was changed dramatically at that point) Once they get this up, running, and somewhat polished, they can maintain it was a small crew, over time. They won't need to run the opening of the AQ gates, or the Naxx pre-events, or any of that.<br />
<br />
They've made no indications they're going to go past that, at all. It's not impossible, but I wouldn't hold your breath - they'd need to hire and train a whole new team to develop a branch of WoW with new content, unless it's existing content like TBC - and Classic needs to be an enormous hit, over time to justify it. Not impossible, but considering they're only offering two zones right now? You're putting the cart way before the horse here. <br />
<br />
And, new content? Two different versions of the lore? LOL. Yeah, that's happening.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Alcsaar</div><div class="date">2018-10-23, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In a past interview they said that they'd need to build the game from the ground up but....what if they used the original cds out there to simply pull the files off them instead of having to rebuild the game OR gut down the current game down. I'm not a game developer so idk which would be the easier route. I just feel using the original retail discs would give the best &quot;Vanilla means Vanilla&quot; experience<br />
<br />
Because the base code even if they do have it is entirely unoptimized for today's hardware (both client and server). It would cause a number of issues that they would have to go back and fix anyway.</div></div><hr />

Even in the best case scenarios for private servers, the clients were emulated and not running natively.<br />
<br />
100% correct, i noticed a lot of the old command lines for the config file simply didn't work. I remember from vanilla that you had to use &quot;SET TimingMethod 2&quot; to stop the character stutter and this didn't work on private servers.<br />

1.5 years for 5 levels of content, this is the real WoW lol<br />
<br />
It's very safe to stay Blizzard are a lot further along than this. They even have a very valid reason for showing the demo level 15 as a lot of classes are very bare before this and it's when you get your first talent point if memory serves me well. If anything I'm the kind of person that would call out Blizzard for lying, and i really don't think they are.<br />

I didn't take him seriously at all, nor I think he meant it that way. I managed to feel a lot of sarcasm in his post, hence my reaction. From my point of view he actually made fun of stereotype we faced back in the day when people were making petitions for Classic to happen, and it's kind of reaction the mob would have from that time that he expressed in his post. Hence my laughter and sense of humor in it all.<br />

WoW classic came out when I was in middle school. I had a good friend who was super into it and got me into it. I started out with a Tauren Warrior but ultimately mained an Orc Warlock. ZG became my favorite raid of all time. Had great memories playing with more friends as they joined too...overall, WoW was so new, so fresh, this was one of best gaming chapters of my life.<br />
<br />
But, here's the thing, while I understand the appeal, and I hope WoW classic does well, there is too much in Vanilla WoW that today is a dealbreaker for me. For example, Im happy to not spend hours standing around a city forming a dungeon group. Im glad that I dont lose hours walking back and forth between quest hubs, or having insanely long walks back from spirit healers. Honestly, the only classic feature I do miss is the talents feature. I hated the day they got rid of talents. It made leveling lose all of its excitement. <br />
<br />
I will dip my toes into this just for talents and nostalgia, but Im not expecting this to be enjoyable at all. Gaming, like life, has evolved so much in the now nearly 14 years since WoW launched. Being so true to the original will,<br />
In the long run, probabaly be a mistake because you can't ignore change. If Blizz thinks tons of old school players will jump all over this, Id bet against them any day</div></div><hr />

Tell me, which of the interim patch changes ruin that vanilla experience for you? The one where they added party-wide buffs? The removal of resource costs for taunts? AoE targeting circles no longer disappearing when you move? Not having to manually resume attacking as a Warrior using Slam? Other than the new content like dungeons and raids, there wasn't THAT massive a difference in the pre-BC patches.<br />
<br />
It's not vanilla WoW if Classic is starting at patch 1.13 instead of patch 1.1, it's post-vanilla if anything. I will freely think of Classic as vanilla-like instead of vanilla and thank you for that privilege.</div></div><hr />

the car work and looks the same as before,<br />
only difference on the old vintage car are:<br />
they install a modern gps allarm (battle.net integration)<br />
they install revisioned seatbelt for safety and change the oil and liquid (64bit support)<br />
they add an assistant help button for &quot;old&quot; people safety (color blind mode)<br />

<br />
Most people I talked to when I got on one for the 1st time recently, said they played on them because that version of WoW had the feel of an MMORPG back then. <br />
<br />
<br />
As for the Nostalgia part, you and others get this so wrong. It's only Nostalgia when that is true. I have Nostalgia about Everquest. I've gone back to try to play that game and that nostalgia hits you in the face and it's true, it was better to think about those times than to play them.<br />
<br />
I've recently also gone onto a PServer to verify this. There was no Nostalgia there because the gameplay and feel of Vanilla was and is so much better than the retail version of Warcraft, my opinion and others as well.<br />
<br />
So that whole &quot;Nostalgia&quot; comment can start dying off because it's been repeatedly been beaten down as a false narrative.<br />
<br />
yeah definitely not, terrible quests, broken classes and specs, grindy as hell in nature, etc.<br />

<br />
I play private servers, and I'm not subbed to retail currently. The moment classic drops, I'm dropping 15/month again if needed. And plenty of others are with me, mostly because private servers (and all your stuff) can always go away, at any moment, be it due to Blizzard or the servers own staff. Official Blizzard servers will be around for a long time. EQ1 is still going and getting expansions, WoW can last a long, long time. And seriously, 15/month is not an amount anyone with a PC and internet should be worrying about. I might even go 6 month just to make it cheaper.<br />
<br />
People love to play old games. There are Tetris tournaments where people from all over the world gather to compete. Why is it so hard for you people to believe that people genuinely want to play Vanilla?<br />
<br />
Because an MMO should never go back to the past. It should keep evolving and you need to adapt. The old game is shit by todays standards and you people need to change your way of thinking and adapt already instead of constantly shitting on retail every chance you get. Plus its like everyone who's played it forgets all the bad about classic, terrible quests, terrible itemization, terrible rotations, terrible raid tuning, grindy as hell, etc and specs were pointless, cookie cutter or you were trash</div></div><hr />

Blizzard didn't use to be as large as they are now. There also wasn't nearly as much version control used pre-2010 as there is used post-2010. Even major companies weren't all using version control before then. Back in '04 when this game came out, I wouldn't be shocked at all to hear that a, at the time, relatively small but growing company didn't have the resources necessary to actually back things up every build.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're starting at patch 1.13 because it isn't fully 1.12: since they have &quot;new&quot; features like the accessibility stuff and a couple of other bugfixes and improvements to prevent some of the more well-known exploits, it can't, in accordance with version control conventions, be called 1.12. It's an incremental update on the last vanilla patch, but it's still for all intents and purposes 1.12. There will be nothing in it content or systems wise that wasn't in originally.</div></div><hr />

Wasn's specially targeted at you, instead was a quote just for the many people who wants to force other people how to play the game. Vanilla or die is stupid when there is a toggle to disable anything that isn't related to vanilla. As would be transmog for example, if there was a toggle that would phase out everything unrelated to vanilla.</div></div><hr />
