CoverItLive Q&amp;A: Class Design &amp; Balance -- (11/9)<br />
To follow up on our first World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria developer Q&amp;A on the CoverItLive platform, we’re gathering the entire class design team to field your questions on the past, present, and future of World of Warcraft classes. Anyone is welcome to join in the live Q&amp;A this Wednesday, November 9, beginning at approximately 10:45 a.m. and concluding around noon PST.<br />
You can read along via the CoverItLive client embedded below while the Q&amp;A is live. To participate, you just use your Facebook, Twitter, Myspace, or OpenID credentials, or simply sign in as a guest. If you’re on the go while the event’s underway on Wednesday, be sure to check out the free mobile apps available on the Android Market and iTunes Store.<br />
We’ll see you back here on Wednesday morning! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/205561/coveritlive-qa-class-design-balance-11-9) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3914934))<br />
<br />
Daily Quests and Game Design<br />
We typically provide some boundaries because, as you've illustrated, something that we allow, is something that can all too easily seem mandatory. That's not what we want, but we do want to provide a reason to come into the game, be in the world, and see what's happening on a frequent basis. It's nice to also be able to offer some rewards for doing that. Naturally, dailies shouldn't be the only way to accrue rewards, and they aren't. Dailies were, in part, a response to a World of Warcraft where there wasn't a lot of incentive to come play on non-raid days, since for many players, the only way to progress became dungeon runs and, for a few, raiding. We also wanted to provide another means of acquiring currency aside from professions, and new ways to acquire reputation with important factions too. They're designed to hit a lot of notes (I'm probably missing some), and I think that they're pretty successful. You don't have to hit your cap, (indeed, one of our fears about a raised daily cap is that players might feel compelled to hit the new, higher cap) but you can if you want to put in the time. Naturally, we also want to continue to add other means of progression to the end-game, and we're looking for ways to do so in a fun and compelling way.<br />
<br />
I get concerned when I see players throwing out words like 'bad design'. Perhaps an individual dislikes a design choice, and that's fine. We do our best, but World of Warcraft can't be all things to all people, all the time. That said, making a value judgment about whether the design is 'bad' or not is not only un-constructive, but in the vast majority of the cases I've seen, such an assessment reveals that the design was not well understood to begin with. These forums represent an opportunity to have a dialogue about the game. I think that choosing words that have context and meaning, and offering alternative solutions, makes for feedback which is more readily useful. <br />
<br />
There are plenty of other dailies where the rewards have been non-power related. The goal was different for Molten Front, and we deliberately wanted to offer a separate path to power for interested players. So, we wanted it to be compelling in that way. Still, it remains that there are alternative, non-raid, paths to power aside from Molten Front. <br />
<br />
It could be argued that, by adding nuances to the zones they're in, they do enrich the game. They add things to hunt for, to seek out, and achieve. They're not easy to get, and that's fine, because they weren't designed to be easy to get. It's a very particular kind of goal for a particular kind of player - we don't expect everyone to pursue them, and if it's not fun for you to do so, then hopefully there are fun goals for you to achieve that are suited to your playstyle.I don't think it would be reasonable to suggest that we haven't made mistakes. We've made them, and acknowledged them throughout the years. There are, however, differences between mistakes and bad design. <br />
<br />
That said, those mistakes haven't typically aligned with the criticisms of 'bad design' I was referring to. Like I said, in just about every post where I've personally seen the words 'bad design' used, there was also a fundamental lack of understanding about design in general. <br />
Usually, it boils down to just another way for people to try to enforce their vision of what World of Warcraft should be. I'm just pointing out that using that tactic in one's feedback is a good way to start off on the wrong foot. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/205528/dailies-is-just-bad-design) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3530365840?page=9#177))<br />

LFR Loot Rules: Questions and Quirks<br />
What we are doing for 4.3 with the Raid Finder looting system (detailed here:http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/3608426) is an experiment in order to try and reduce loot drama without removing the chance to benefit from offspec gear completely. In fact, a lot of what we are trying with Raid Finder for 4.3 is our very first attempt at a design that is going to need a lot of iteration before we’re happy with how it works. We’ll use the information we gather on the new looting system (we can call it Need+, for simplicity's sake) and Raid Finder in 4.3 to make both features even better for Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
The game currently does not have a very robust notion of what your spec is, so for now we can’t make the loot rules very stringent, other than checking your current role. In Mists of Pandaria, the game will have a well-developed &quot;concept&quot; of spec, and we can do things like let an Enhancement shaman roll need plus on an Agility axe without letting the Restoration shaman roll need plus. (The Resto shaman could still roll need though, since shaman can use axes and the player might presumably have an Enhancement offspec.)

Item Squishing and Old Raids<br />
It seems to me that some of those that have expressed misgivings about the squish are worried about feeling 'nerfed' when facing older content, but the item squish shouldn't mean that soloing older raid content will die, necessarily. Though we appreciate the feedback, I think it's safe to say that we wouldn't want anyone to turn their back on the idea purely out of concern for losing the ability to take down older raids solo or in small groups.<br />
<br />
Isn't the point of big numbers that they're big relative to the other numbers in the game, though? I can't speak for you, obviously, but I enjoyed putting out big numbers in previous expansions, and I expect that once I got a feel for the new baselines, I'd likely feel the same way in the future as well.

Shadow Priest Set Bonus<br />
Shadow Word: Death ignores absorption effects for purposes of the mana returned. The “damaging attack” part is still reduced by absorption effects though.

Dailies in the game is currently pretty much mandatory for new level 85s if they want a chance to gear up, there is no real way around Molten Front dailies. Further more some reputation can ONLY be raised by dailies, the same with specific items that require to do X amount of dailies.<br />
Dailies is in my opinion one of the worst ideas to get into WoW, and it is bad design now. Generally dailies needs to be done on a daily basis, or players eventually get punished by not doing them by either getting behind on others and loosing the advantage (JC Tokens is an example). Dailies as an option to earn extra gold it is fantastic, the second it moved from that to be in pretty much everything, the good idea became bad and grinding just changed from &quot;When feeling like it&quot; to &quot;Every day for X amount of time&quot;.</div></div><hr />

This sounds like a complaint since the introduction of them though. Even the Og'rila and Skyguard reps had good stuff for new 70s, and just like then, there are ways around it (raiding).</div></div><hr />

So that's how they solved the issue about Combat Rogues and the daggers. I do wonder why they don't buff Killing Spree damage with the daggers though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except as a new 85 you can easily do Molten front dailies with greens, you can raid in greens too if you get carried, but they require a lot more people, and honestly most would except a guildie do to their part as well, which is dailies.<br />
<br />
Dailies/Raiding/Gold are your options for PvE gear, and i honestly see 5man heroics as dailies these days as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This.<br />
<br />
Why must we hit artificial boundaries to get stuff, for example the items from the Molten Front? Why shouldn't we be able to grind if we wish to?<br />
<br />
There isn't a reason why daily quests and grinding can't co-exist. Players could opt for doing sets of dailies each day, which provides a higher tokens/hour ratio. Other players may just want to get the items asap, so they could grind a repeatable quest or mobs or something.<br />

Why must we hit artificial boundaries to get stuff, for example the items from the Molten Front? Why shouldn't we be able to grind if we wish to?<br />
<br />
There isn't a reason why daily quests and grinding can't co-exist. Players could opt for doing sets of dailies each day, which provides a higher tokens/hour ratio. Other players may just want to get the items asap, so they could grind a repeatable quest or mobs or something.<br />

they don't let you grind it out so people don't feel obliged to play for 15 hours straight to get a new bit of gear to be ready for raid night.</div></div><hr />

It will be like AOC orginal system where new gear became irrellevant and ppl just killed new raids in old gear. Blizzard has tried to reduce the stat diffrence before. They did it between tier 1 and tier 2 in TBC. PPL simply did not bother doing tier 2 then cause there was zero benefit in it. Gear is the key to progression raiding. Skills are only very small part of it compared to pure stats. BLizzard CAN NOT change the stat curve without seriously harming the entire game structure.<br />

About daily quests ... they become SOOOO boring over time cause you have to do them so often. Instead of beeing enjoyable the become nightmares that you remember entire expansions for. And the memory is not pleasant at all. Specially if you got alts. First thing I would do is to cut the number of daylies down to 10 again. Then I would make some weekly ones that you can do any day of the week - some of them would be 5 mans. Then I would add at least 1 daily LFR encounter that is specificly targeted for simple but fun encounters. THese daylies would stack so that if you dont do them one day... you can do 2 (up to 7) in one day. RIFT has added alot of intresting and diffrent featues when it comes to content in the last few months. Blizzard is on the other hand falling far back and is feeling more and more like a dinosaur. They really need to reinvent few things SPECIALLY including the daily quests that are litterally the most boring and horrible part of the game atm.</div></div><hr />

But it's a much better time for Europeans. We'll always try to fluctuate the Q&amp;A schedule a bit to accommodate for our global audience. :)<br />
<br />

The Time for this is 6:45pm uk/7:45pm server time which is a better time of the day than 1am like the last one.<br />
<br />
Thing is, The American devs obviously don't know that the UK/EU Reset is on a Wednesday (Americas is on a Tuesday, plus this Q&amp;A is in the morning for them). <br />
<br />
The majority of the player base who would be interseted in this will be UNABLE to take part due to the fact that they will be raiding at that time. (If they had bothered to do any reserch on the UK/EU forums the American dev responsable for this live Q&amp;A would know this...)<br />
<br />
So to cut a short story shorter us UK/European get the /slap yet again &gt;_&gt;</div></div><hr />

http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/62898/tol-barad-commendation/<br />
And now the new currency at the Darkmoon Faire is also from dailies.<br />
<br />
Dailies in the game is currently pretty much mandatory for new level 85s if they want a chance to gear up, there is no real way around Molten Front dailies. Further more some reputation can ONLY be raised by dailies, the same with specific items that require to do X amount of dailies.<br />
Dailies is in my opinion one of the worst ideas to get into WoW, and it is bad design now. Generally dailies needs to be done on a daily basis, or players eventually get punished by not doing them by either getting behind on others and loosing the advantage (JC Tokens is an example). Dailies as an option to earn extra gold it is fantastic, the second it moved from that to be in pretty much everything, the good idea became bad and grinding just changed from &quot;When feeling like it&quot; to &quot;Every day for X amount of time&quot;.<br />
<br />
Ahh yes but dailies are cheaper to develop than actual content, so expect many many many many more of them.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I agree that they are cheaper. But doing the same ones for 1 month and up to 20 or more per day is simply too much. <br />
<br />
Blizzard needs to rethink this cause for players that are returning - this is a nightmare way to get better gear. Cause lets face it... they can't go for raids with crap gear and none knowledge of tactics.<br />
<br />
So basicly... Blizzard looses every player that unsubs for 2-3 months in every expansion. Daylies just push ppl even further away.</div></div><hr />

I'd love to do the Argent Tournament Dailies and other such quests to shore up some of my missing mounts and pets, but since the MF dailies are practically mandatory for a non-raider like me....I can't. And yes, i'm still unlocking the MF dailies because i'm one of those people Deadanon mentioned.....I took a few months off and now I have to daily grind to catch up.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
The tokens from the Darkmoon Faire dailies are just an extra amount that you can grab while doing the games at the Faire.<br />
The games themselves also reward tokens.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
More activities are now offered and on the test realms you can currently try:<br />
<br />
A target shooting game where you have to score 25 points in 60 seconds.<br />
The &quot;Tonk Commander&quot; game, where you have to shoot 30 targets with your Tonk in a set amount of time.<br />
A ring tossing game, the goal is to toss rings on the turtle in the playing area.<br />
The Darkmoon Cannon is still here, and will require you to trigger a skill while you fly to land and hit a target on the ground/water.<br />
The new &quot;Whack-a-gnoll&quot; mini-game seems to be missing from test realms for the moment.<br />
The Darkmoon Deathmatch Arena, the name pretty much says it all. Any player entering the Arena will be flagged for PvP and able to fight any other players already there.<br />
Profession quests, rewarding you with tickets and a +5 bonus to your profession skill.<br />
Last but not least, L90ETC gives a concert every hour!<br />
<br />
These games will reward you with Darkmoon Prize Ticket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/71970/darkmoon-prize-ticket/) and after collecting enough of them, you will be able to buy rewards from the Darkmoon Faire vendors.</div></div><hr />

That blog is just about the Brazil version of WoW being released on the 6th of December.<br />
I doubt they'll need 4.3 to implement that version, as they already tested it on a previous PTR if I remember correctly.<br />

I believe they will need that major patch to apply the brasilian language, once it was introduced in this las PTR, that i'm testing, there are some things that are not translated yet, the translation is still in development, i may be wrong, but imo 6th december is the date. :cool:</div></div><hr />

Still not relevant with this patch. It's more of a language pack addon, which you can download and slap over your english client, but the client doesn't need itto work.</div></div><hr />
