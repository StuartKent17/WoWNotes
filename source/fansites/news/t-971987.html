10 weeks to the day.<br />
<br />
Yeah, if anybody is still surprised/outraged/face-slapped that Blizzard nerfs raids after time passes, well...don't really know what to tell 'em. Especially with cases like this, where we're not talking about difficult Achievements. Less than 60 guilds (10 and 25 combined) have killed Heroic Ragnaros. Period. 10 weeks in.</div></div><hr />

That is, the Channelers actually DO increase the power of the Magma fire guys. Previously, you could just nuke the guy that un-shields the channelers and slowly kill the Channelers without it affecting the magma elementals much.<br />
<br />
This means you have to pause DPS to rapidly kill the channelers each time the main guy &quot;motivates&quot; them to prevent the Magma elemental from killing everyryone.</div></div><hr />

If it was completely blocked off, so that you didn't have to use it if you didn't want to, that'd be one thing. But you can buy gold on the real-money AH, which means that any and all AH transactions - whether gold or cash - will be directly controlled by the real-money AH. The gold cost of any item will be equal to or higher than the amount of gold which could be purchased for whatever cash price the item is going for on the real-money AH. That's obvious and unavoidable.<br />

Ridiculous decision.</div></div><hr />

Was in denial about that and hoping against the odds that Nightmare is Magic was just a terrible coincidence. Unfortunately I don't obsess over a little girls cartoon show so the other names didn't ring any immediate bells, my bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really don't think the coverage of Diablo is taking away from their WoW coverage at all, besides, a lot of regular MMO-Champion-goers are quite interested in the Diablo and StarCraft universes as well. Feel free to personally disregard the news that you don't particularly care for.</div></div><hr />

this opens the question as to in the past Boub said this is a wow fan site and there would be little to no information regarding other games. this disproves his prior statement, so the question needs to be asked, if this IS still a WoW Fan site why is he posting Diablo 3 information? or is it just a Blizzard Fan Boi Website instead? if it's neither, then why isn't there information regarding other games on the front page?</div></div><hr />

Its a WoW fan site guys. Thats like asking IGN or Gamespot to stop making video game articles and coverage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are you covering Diablo btw ? It's not like it's an mmo or anything. Stick to WoW news please.<br />
<br />
Its a Blizzard game and is therefore related to WoW in one way or another. (D3 WoW pets, what the blizz devs are busy with, etc.) I'm glad they've been covering it because they've single handedly got me interested in D3.</div></div><hr />

If it was completely blocked off, so that you didn't have to use it if you didn't want to, that'd be one thing. But you can buy gold on the real-money AH, which means that any and all AH transactions - whether gold or cash - will be directly controlled by the real-money AH. The gold cost of any item will be equal to or higher than the amount of gold which could be purchased for whatever cash price the item is going for on the real-money AH. That's obvious and unavoidable.<br />
<br />
Ridiculous decision.<br />
<br />
The excitement fizzled out for who? Just You? Who cares about you Just a singular Peon. I'm amped for Diablo 3 and I can bet ya your WoW account that when Diablo releases it will be the top selling PC game of That year. whether its 2011 or 2012.</div></div><hr />

YOu're basically saying conform to a hardcore guild or get out. Some of us do have lives and are happy with our current guilds, even if we may feel them to be lacking in the progression we desire. Does that mean we're not entitled to experience fights only a handful out of millions can actually enjoy? I think not. GEt off your high horse. Because yes, making a fight that what, 30 guilds worldwide have killed out of 100's of thousands of gulds is *totally* catering to casuals.</div></div><hr />

I think this is the third craze I've seen get so bad over people JUST wanting to feel special for using avatars/reaction images that nobody else does. Though they're not nearly as bad as the scene kiddies who think they're being ironic by watching a little girls cartoon. Pop culture references are expected from Blizzard, but I was expecting something more neutral for something as iconic as the secret level. Bit of a misstep to see them ostracizing the content for the majority of the fanbase merely to gain the blind loyalty of a fickle demographic which could be riding an entirely different bandwagon by the time the game comes out.</div></div><hr />

Fights were you use 3 healers are a bit overtuned as far as DPS goes.<br />

That sounds like a Mario Kart 64 stage, but that's all I know. Not sure if it's anything else. Aside from that, seems like Diablo is going to be pretty decent when it comes out. Maybe I should make the investment of buying that game and get interested.</div></div><hr />

Moo Moo Farm, also known as the 'Secret Cow Level', is a secret area in Diablo II where you fight, wait for it, bipedal cows.<br />

This is the sort of crap that I hate. Because having a crazy difficult fight nerfed so that more than .18% of guilds can clear it means that &quot;WoW is catering to casuals&quot;. Just another &quot;SWTOR IS GOD&quot; troll. What are you, 12? Pathetic.</div></div><hr />

Well there are some things to remember here.<br />
<br />
This site is owned by Curse now.<br />
<br />
Curse covers alot more than just World of Warcraft in content on it's site so it only makes sense they will ask an MMO site they own start covering more than just WoW.<br />
<br />
Boub still has to answer to the higher ups who may be asking to have more stuff even if it is just Blizzard games to be covered on the site.<br />
<br />
The site used to only cover WoW but times change and so do sites.</div></div><hr />

Another blind faith SWTOR fanboy? Do you seriously think SWTOR is going to cater to hardcore players? I highly doubt that, bioware wont work like that. Biowares games over the years have been retardedly easy to play, i dont see SWTOR falling very far from that expecially if they want to pull in alot of subscriptions. Seriously give it a month or two after SWTOR's been released and you'll probally be whining on they're forums that the game is to easy<br />

people like you amuse me thinking your all hardcore. The truth of the matter the 60 guilds that can sit in front of a computer and not actually do anything outside the house (like work) got their kill. They will be able to brag they did it pre-nerf like they always have since TBC. Me personally I don't care if someone kills H Rag or not you wanna impress me get a glad title, cause until you do your still a newb imo.</div></div><hr />

Wall of textrage. What is the point? Are you calling the thousands of other guilds for casual and mediocre? What are you talking about??? Just because you are one of those sitting on your flat arse 24/7 playing video games does not mean that people like me, and i would guess, 75-80% of the rest of the community, doesn't have a life. I for example do not want to waste 6-7 hours a day on progressing though a raid, not even heroic mode, thats absurd in every respect possible. Now, this nerf is well deserved, and your rage will not work. By the way, you are no better than anyone else defending anything. SWTOR fanboys is not better... and trust me, that game will face some nerfs and hotfixes too, no game is perfect. But i hand it to you, if you think that no game needs hotfixes, nerfs, increases of power, so on... you're a damned fool. Just my two cents.</div></div><hr />

I don't understand why he would receive an infraction for this, especially with what they're doing in Diablo is true.</div></div><hr />

In response to this, and a bunch of other posts; Because Activision-Blizzard pays Curse's bills.</div></div><hr />

You people are fucking sickening with &quot;who cares just play the game&quot;. You handi capped casual players aka people don't wanna put any effort at all in to the game is exactly why the game is so damn easy and loses more and more people. There might be only 58 guilds out there that beat it but so what? learn from in what they did to actually beat him instead of using your bull shit casual excuses you people always come up with. The patch just came out how long ago and a fucking nerf is already out for it? And it's a wonder why SWTOR is gonna T-bag wow with it's light saber. ;) Yeah blizzard keep catering to these casual tards that don't know strategy and wonder why people keep leaving. Of course they don't care because they are working on the new mmo and people will go there. WoW is most likely already dead to them and they are just keeping it online and having expansions to make money out of it while it can. Hope you casual's enjoy being t-bagged by that light saber. :)<br />

Someone like this was infracted, but not banned? Hello mods? :confused:? Oh, and SWTOR is going to be aimed at casual players as well - encase you didn't notice http://http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJS5HZyClZQ&amp;lc=YHM6LHQN7O5hiFBhi41VGfOk9n-QUS1GjLP-rVTXxMU&amp;feature=inbox (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJS5HZyClZQ&amp;lc=YHM6LHQN7O5hiFBhi41VGfOk9n-QUS1GjLP-rVTXxMU&amp;feature=inbox&quot;)<br />

Well, probably to do with the fact the comment wasn't very constructive. Look at it this way, unless MMO champ forgoing WoW news for Diablo III news, maybe they would have a point, but I'm pretty sure this is not the case. An Infraction is not a ban so, take it easy. :cool:</div></div><hr />

Honestly unless youre one of the .001% of wows population who have killed it dont bitch about it. It just makes you look stupid. Its the hardest fight from top to bottom blizzard has ever made...of course there are going to be some big nerfs coming soon.</div></div><hr />

That is most definitely wrong... I don't remember any &quot;this fight is statistically impossible&quot; threads made about H Rag</div></div><hr />

So much we wouldn't be surprised to kill him right here and now. :/ ..What's the point, Blizz? Scrubs still won't be able to do heroic modes, and we get less fun out of it.<br />
<br />
While this may have been overboard, it's kind of needed (to some degree) for the US since their internet is so terrible compared to Europe. 10ms latency vs 200-500 - that's probably a minute+ of extra solid dps time not to mention the avoidance of countless deaths (they have been out of the fire for almost half a second and you don't even know that it's there yet). You might as well be in the special Olympics.</div></div><hr />

Of course, that's fine, but they really really nerfed him hard now. Can't they be a bit less dramatic with nerfs?<br />

I don't know about the internet in the US, or US people's latency. Most Europeans I know have around 80-200 MS, some have a lot more, and some have a lot less.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure how anyone can play properly with 200-500 MS though, I'd get so ragey I'd try to chew my elbow off.</div></div><hr />

He's been banned for 3 months. <br />
<br />
Sigh...<br />
Anyway, expect the beta to come out before the end of september, though I honestly don't see this game coming out in 2011.</div></div><hr />

She is far too great and too powerful to be an enemy.<br />
