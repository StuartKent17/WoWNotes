Greetings all, 
PTR realms will be coming down today in order to deploy a new 7.3.0 build. No ETA for today's push but I'll do my best to update this thread if things look like they're going to take longer than usual (~4-6 hours).  
 
As usual I'll leave this thread open for discussion so long as conversations remain civil and adhere to forum guidelines. 
 
Thanks for your patience everyone.

Even though Blizzard hotfixed Odyn's Trial of Valor loot table, that's still a very low drop rate compared to Nithogg's 100%. =/<br />
<br />
Guess fixing the so-called world boss rotation (or whatever it is) is going to have to wait 'til 7.3.</div></div><hr />
