No, he is right.<br />
<br />
It seems like it is severely undertuned.<br />
<br />
When is the last time this happened? Can't remember. I don't think it has. They cleared the entire raid in less than 24 hours on THE hardest difficulty in game.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they see it as a mistake.<br />
I really don't. There is no way they did not predict this outcome.<br />
<br />
It is intentional. The gearing system is being shaped in to something that is non-linear.</div></div><hr />

From the PoV of the actual race to World First for EN, it's undeniably disappointing that it looks like Xavius pretty much fell over after Cenarius. Probably RNG Loot affecting some of the earlier bosses, but I think they increased the HP on one of them by a 200 mil or something.<br />

Would have liked to have seen another Guild or two at 6/7, and it last longer than one day, hopefully Nighthold is better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also people shouldn't be instantly assuming there was legitimate strategies going on for one-day clear. Blizzard was never good about keeping track of bugs/exploits. They either overtune, or undertune.<br />
<br />
With RNG loot and possible to outgear content before stepping into it, they should always go for overtuning. They dropped the ball.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really. World first capable guilds are always downing bosses relatively fast compared to the release. These are guilds who raid test these bosses over and over on the PTR. Not to take anything away from their accomplishment, but they aren't going in completely blind. They're still putting in the work.</div></div><hr />

Lol no one is saying that. Quite the opposite: they won because of the lower ilevel. They didn't do splits which was just a lucky guess that granted them free WF on a super undertuned endboss.</div></div><hr />

Why? Because to me, it's not a true raiding tier as it doesn't even have tier armor. Much like in WoD, I personally considered that initial ogre raid crap a boring waste of time since, again, no tier from it. This new intro raid BS before actually moving to ones that drop tier is stupid imo. EN is more of a glorified dungeon really (well ok that can be true of any raid, but at least to me, raids are defined by having tier armor, pretty much every one besides a few in vanilla did, and vanilla gets a pass since it was WoW 1.0 when things were still coalescing).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well looking at the hotfixes, a prot paladin probably could cheese the tanking debuffs with immunities (bubble and blessing of spellwarding) and warlocks could further cheese them by dispelling with imps for no corruption. (I am not raiding, I guess those probably were widely known among raiders?)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We'll have to see tomorrow, but at this point it looks like Exorsus won because they went straight into mythic. Serenity and Method spent a couple hours farming gear in Emerald Nightmare Heroic today, and went to bed relatively early. Exorsus went straight into Mythic and raided for 17 hours. Because the instance was easy that strategy worked this time. It typically hasn't worked with harder raids.</div></div><hr />

Method and Serenity are both clear of every US guild. Think about that for a second. A guild lost a huge chunk of their raiders who made their own guild.. and both of them are better than any US raid guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Typically, the only thing that is not tested is the end boss of a raid on it's highest difficulty. It is a necessary evil. Bosses that go untested are almost always filled huge bugs, especially with boss encounters getting more complex as the game grows. There are numerous statements from top raiders about progressing of an encounter that has never been tested, and blizzard constantly hotfixing the bosses mid-pull even. There is no real way around it.</div></div><hr />

Judging by the hotfix, immunity effects cheese all the stacks. Also it seems you could use imps to cleanse the debuffs as well so maybe they just dropped the debuffs really often</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is hard. 99% of all guilds will ram their face into these bosses. It just so happends, that we do have some really good and dedicated people still playing WoW. These guys have proberly had a plan since the first minute of mythic opening and have played as much as they can. <br />
<br />
So don't worry. Most mythic guilds are not gonna be without content anytime soon :D</div></div><hr />

Are you trolling? Do you thinking wiping on a boss for 8 hours straight is easy? You will probably never clear mythic and you are over here talking about blizzard making it harder.<br />

I'm not saying that, just stating the fact. beside there are two warlock alts in their guild with having cutting edge Xavius achievement. one (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%84%D1%8C%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B4/%D0%A8%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%83%D1%84%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4/advanced) , Two (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/character/%D1%80%D0%B5%D0%B2%D1%83%D1%89%D0%B8%D0%B9-%D1%84%D1%8C%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B4/%D0%A1%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%BA%D0%B9/advanced). so it may be possible that they brought them in for Xavius but blizz hotfixed it midfight like Method Vs. Thok. So either way we still dont know about that!</div></div><hr />

I expected them to be 2d this time but well... they made it.<br />
Also, seems like Sco did the right thing sticking to his guns. His new team did fine and Serenity pretty much shat the bed.<br />
<br />
As for difficulty - I really expected EN to last for 5-6 days at least. But it looks like with new &quot;loot roller coaster&quot; they need to learn how to balance bosses anew. Hope they will use new data properly.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't matter either way. They didn't kill it using the Warlock dispel. Sure they may have on Heroic, and done attempts on it with a mid fight fix by blizzard. But the kill, was done without locks. Isn't that what matters at this point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah that's the whole point, They killed him without exploiting anything which is great!! <br />
<br />
But I was talking about that hotfixed, which you mentioned with confidence<br />
<br />
They did not however take any warlocks. So they weren't using imp's to dispel<br />
so how could blizz knew it would affect progression on Mythic difficulty without actually seeing it? so it may have happened that they immediately pushed out the new hotfixed. (FACT)<br />
<br />
P.S, Overall I agree with your argument, there is nothing beside that.</div></div><hr />

Yea I see your point. If Blizzard did hotfix the imp's then even more kudos to Exorsus for continuing on to success in such a small timeframe, I read elsewhere they only spent 1h 42m on Xavius. <br />
<br />
Blizzard do watch guilds progress. They just sit in the corner as an invisible GM</div></div><hr />

Back when the reason they took months was because of massive attunrments. Insane amount of farming required. Huge difficult pools like getting 8 tanks with their their sets. And back when bugs we're so buggy when they first came out they were mostly unkillable till fixed? Mhm yeah</div></div><hr />

Yea I thought they did take a Holy Paladin but then double checked and I was wrong.<br />

Can't think of any immunities from those classes that would help cheese the dispel. Aside from Mass Dispel from Spriests? Not sure if Mass Dispel removes the darkening or not....<br />

<br />
It's because this time, people had access to heroic raid level gear before the raids were even released.<br />
<br />
Guilds like these farmed the fuck out of mythic+ so that before EN was even released, these people were already above its gear level, thus, fully geared to do Mythic.<br />
<br />
This has never happened before. Think back to WoD, where there was only 1 week before raids opened, and the highest ilvl you could get was still below the level of even normal Highmaul. Even if you got ALL warforged gear from heroics, you'd maybe be able to get 638 or 639 ilvl, with Highmaul dropping 655 pieces on normal, and 670 on heroic.<br />
<br />
Now imagine if people could get to ilvl 670 before the raid even released....that's kinda what happened here. People became fully geared for Mythic, before Mythic was even released. That's why it was cleared so fast.<br />
<br />
This isn't a case of the raid being undertuned, this is a case of the players being overtuned due to Titanforged gear and Mythic+ gear.</div></div><hr />

It has nothing to do with the guild. No shit they're going to take optimal classes. It's not their fault classes aren't balanced correctly (some are literally 30% and even more ahead of others), it's blizzards.<br />
<br />
They don't need perfect balance. To think that's what we're even talking about is stupid. What we need is for classes not to be 30% or more ahead of each other.<br />

Yes, can confirm this. I stuffed it up the first time, which tbh I expected I may have, so they did use a Paladin and therefore 1 immunity to help with the dispels. Then blizzard hotfixed it a little after so that it won't remove the debuff anymore.</div></div><hr />

A thing about class balance, artifact traits totally contribute to imbalance. SOme specs just have to choose between ST and AoE. I doubt even these players had 30+ traits. Trial of Valor will be more indicative of class balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if classes were within 10% of each other, bleeding edge progression would still take the &quot;best&quot; ones. Hell, even if there was a 1% difference, there would still be class stacking.<br />
<br />
Not only on damage front, but on utility/niche front. Stuff like Nefarian in BWL and how feral druids were really good because of their long DoTs. Certain classes are just better at certain fights due to how they work. Blizzard can't really fix that without severely homogenizing class abilities.<br />
<br />
And they don't balance around the top 0.1% of players to begin with, so...yeah.</div></div><hr />

Yeah that's what I'm hoping. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. It's no easy job to balance 36 specs with 7 talent rows and 30+ artifact traits per spec. It's ridiculous, but it is their job. So I do hope that it'll be a lot better by the time Kara and ToV come out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Again he is not undertuned. We are used to these guilds facing the bosses at a much lower ilvl relative to the intended. In this kill, people had 868 ilvl, that is higher than full HC gear. THey probably faced a smaller ilvl disadvantage against the final boss than most other tier endboss kills ever had (maybe LK due to gating). It by no means invalidates their success but it also does not mean that Xavius is undertuned. SImply put, a boss that is tuned tightly enough for these people at the proper ilvl would simply be impossible for everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Yea took them 8 hours to down Cenarius, which given they beat Xavius 17 hours after release, half of their time was spent on this one boss.</div></div><hr />

You can save yourself a lot of time and just resub in 18 months. They'll have released their final raid tier and have a long year-gap before the next expansion. They'll be desperate to keep people subbed and offer artifact leveling that is 1000x faster even without research and free gear out the wazoo.</div></div><hr />

I can't tell if you're joking or have the memory of a dead goldfish.<br />
Just to throw it out there: We're a full month into Legion and most people haven't even really gotten started on a second 110 because they're so occupied on their mains.<br />
By this time in WoD, or no, about 2-3 weeks into WoD, even the casuals realized that after an afternoon or two of dungeons and a couple of days working on their garrisons, they had pretty much nothing to do for progression whatsoever in 6.0.<br />
<br />
But sure buddy. People run out of things faster in Legion than all of WoD... if they quit at level 107.</div></div><hr />

A 7-boss raid tier [...]<br />
<br />
Except it's not the full raid tier. The first tier is designed exactly how WoD's first tier was - first raid is just a 7-boss thing without tier gear, then the next raid (BRF then, Nighthold now) is the second half of this raid tier with the actual tier gear.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why people are so skeptical about this. Exorsus has been a top contender for a while now, and they stacked all the right classes to make this tier as easy as possible. Basically everyone who has been playing a lot since the expansion came out has a legendary on their main now.<br />

If you're talking about Classic/TBC raids, then there was only 1 difficulty and it wasn't hard because it was complicated or &quot;challenging&quot;, it was hard because it was tuned so you needed months of gear farming beforehand.</div></div><hr />

Hahah what? Yes wiping on a boss for 8 hours is easy. Shit that was the normal thing to do in raids once upon a time. Try wiping to the same boss for 8 hours straight every day for over a month. One fucking day though? Yeah bro that's not exactly a crazy thing. And I speak as someone who raided in a top guild for a period of 6 years. <br />

If you think the best players in the game in 2004 are anywhere near the level of skill and experience of the best players in the game 12 years later, you're crazy.<br />
<br />
Fights have gotten harder and more intricately designed, players have been getting better, addon support has gotten absurd. The game is very different. It's not a fair comparison at all.</div></div><hr />

Think about it, a week before Mythic and LFR launch players were able to go do a different format of content that rewards very high levels of gear. Unlike past expansions where the best stuff you could get was from the raid on lower difficulties, now you can run those mythic+ dungeons for Mythic raid level loot. And that's not including legendaries or titanforged drops either.<br />
<br />
And to all the folks out there singing about how much easier it is because 1 group of people across a span of millions of gamers has beaten the tier... Come on guys do we really have to start with the silliest of arguments? I honestly know, and have played with, people who if you handed em an itemlevel 895 character right now would NEVER clear this.</div></div><hr />

Seems like blizzard creat hard content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Interesting I didn't know that Chromaggus was alive for that long. I always wondered why Blizzard hasn't created another fight like him. I really enjoyed it. I also liked fights when you didn't know what part of the room was best to fight the boss in. Just the little things. Also if I recall Four Horsemen were up there in length too. That fight was insane. I remember posting on the forums discussing it with a female human Mage in Death and Taxes who assured us the fight wasn't impossible when we all thought it was. Sure enough he was right and they snagged the kill not long after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Comparing it with naxx 25 please. Naxx 25 was put there only to have more content and an excuse for blizzard to re-use it was that not everyone had experienced it. Naxx wasn't supposed to be hard and everyone knew exactly what the boss abilities were. Also undertuned and made easier compared to Naxx 40, especially the horsemen fight of course.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fights have gotten harder and more intricately designed, players have been getting better, addon support has gotten absurd. The game is very different. It's not a fair comparison at all.<br />
<br />
I never said they were the same, just that there were great players back then too. Hell many of them worked for Blizzard too.<br />

<br />
Yeah definitely. I actually hated the idea of Naxx coming back so easy, but I found myself enjoying it all the same despite having done it before. It was still a great looking instance and felt epic. Very underrated in my opinion when people discuss the best raids. And yeah Horsemen were a total joke compared to the original. Even Gothik was for that matter. Gothik was actually difficult in vanilla naxx, but no one even remembers him in 25M.</div></div><hr />

Think about it, a week before Mythic and LFR launch players were able to go do a different format of content that rewards very high levels of gear. Unlike past expansions where the best stuff you could get was from the raid on lower difficulties, now you can run those mythic+ dungeons for Mythic raid level loot. And that's not including legendaries or titanforged drops either.<br />
<br />
And to all the folks out there singing about how much easier it is because 1 group of people across a span of millions of gamers has beaten the tier... Come on guys do we really have to start with the silliest of arguments? I honestly know, and have played with, people who if you handed em an itemlevel 895 character right now would NEVER clear this.<br />
<br />
Holy shit they killed Gul'dan already?! <br />
<br />
Seriously Big grats on completing the first half of the tier. Just don't be like Paragon and Blood Legion and lose the tier End boss.</div></div><hr />

Your opinion is pretty ignorant on this topic. With 7 bosses this stuff is inevitable unless you want them to gate the content. Some people are just that good, and if you're going to tune the game around THEM not being able to do that you're gonna fuck up the game so hard people are gonna leave left and right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why would they leave left and right? Mythic is just another difficulty degree. Did people not buy Doom 2 because they couldn't complete it on nightmare? No they didn't they just completed the difficult they were able to complete. People have LFR, normal, and heroic as options too. Mythic should be, mythic.</div></div><hr />

Bad news for you, it wasn't. In Regards of Mechanics I think new expansions get more and more difficult with new things added. The reason it took guilds month to clear bosses was the fact to coordinate 40 people at the same time plus gearing them which took months alone. So don't blame the difficulty of a raid if you aren't able to clear it by yourself.<br />
<br />
In my opinion the reason for this mess is the fucked up loot system. It's just too much of rng. I don't know what's the intent of blizzard stacking to these warforged/titanforged shit. The whole system fucks up item tiers so bad. You're either lucky or your behind.</div></div><hr />

Hey guess what buddy Highmaul had 7 bosses too and still took around 4 days for a guild to go 7/7, and considering guilds raid 16-18 hours a day that's about 50+hours longer. So umm I wonder who's the ignorant one?</div></div><hr />

Funny, when WoW came out it was essentially the gimped, ezmode version of real MMO's - now people are acting like WoW of today (which really isn't any harder - in many ways it's easier and less time consuming because of streamlining and not having to care about professions) is somehow 'hard'.<br />

Naxx was cleared on day one by extremely undergeared people and that says something about it (25). Meanwhile this is the first time we see top tier raid groups dealing with Mythic without being severely undergeared (all of them in the running have gear better than HC EN and probably a trait or two more than Blizz designed the fight for). I think it was less about brute forcing the encounter and more about Exorsus coming with the best strategy faster than everyone else.</div></div><hr />

like every other guild on that list? Especially US guilds running 19/20 legendaries with people multiboxing 5 or more of the same class just to get a legendary. <br />

<br />
I think it was ilvl, but I don't think it's a case of 'lucky or behind'. ~20 people all got 'super lucky'? I think what is more likely a factor here is that they were all at least 850(as you'd expect from a hardcore group) when Mythic + came out, and they ran the 'non-lockout' system of Mythic + into the ground. These guys have been running Mythich + 10's(their guild has the achievements for them). That's how many chances at loot? &quot;RNG&quot; kinda goes out the window when you have 100's of chances at it like these guys had.</div></div><hr />

Did not expect that it would take less than 24hours but somewhere between friday-sunday would have been my expectation. <br />
<br />
I play rather casual and got 862 ilvl by grinding the shit out of m+. Those bosses probably got tuned for 865-870 ilvl and if you play at a really high level and got the ilvl (dps/hps) requiremnts allready then it's only a matter of who figures the boss out first. Ofcourse there's class stacking, ofcourse they will try to &quot;abuse&quot; mechanics within the game but those guys got the tactics down allready and it's only a matter of fine-tuning and execution.<br />
<br />
Before people start bitching back in MoP I raided for a top10 guild so I kinda know how dedicated those people are and the only thing hard about the prorgess back then was being 10-15 ilvl below what the boss got tuned for. (no fails, max dps, class stacking. perfect raid-cd management - sometimes you simply had to play close to perfect to even come close to a kill AND THOSE GUYS CAN PLAY &quot;PERFECT&quot; EVEN IF THEY WOULD BRUTEFORCE A BOSS OVER 20HOURS STRAIGHT<br />

And to most guys thinking they've cleared it in 17 hours – please, stop. They've had 20 hours of WoW every day for 29 days straight. Yes, all of them have legendaries – but that's what happens when you level and work on 3-4 characters of the SAME class and farm x3-4, so when one of those gets lucky with legendary and becomes your &quot;main&quot;.<br />
<br />
Yes, bosses took more time when the grass was greener, due to multiple reasons, but the main one for me is that – people are becoming better at everything they do over time. We've already seen most mechanics, you can describe almost every boss like – okay, so we have a Chogall corruption, Archimonde blades, meteor to split, pools to soak, adds to kill. We already went through them thousands of times.<br />
<br />
Also, the tools are progressing. Remember how Paragon introduced split raids in Wotlk to overcome limited attemtps? That's what they use for gearing now and nothing can be really done to this – so yeah, top10-20 guilds are coming nigh full heroic to the mythic. The good thing is that only ~3000 players out of millions are doing that, so there's no need to fix that really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And they will. Today or tomorrow, I expect at least 10-15 guilds to clear it. The thing about warforged/titanforged is that with grinding the gear, you just outgear the bosses. The more gear you have, the less perfect you have to play. And these people can play perfect, therefore if they play perfect AND outgear the bosses, it takes just couple of hours to clear whole instance. And Blizzard CANNOT tune the bosses to these people, they have to leave some margin for error. Next time, they should just make sure that these guilds cannot straight up grind gear that may even be better than the gear that drops from the raid they are trying to clear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you actually cleared this on Mythic? If not, stop walking about crap that you aren't doing. The content is plenty hard for over 95% of raiders right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
how do you make it harder when these guys devote their entire life to clear it? i mean this is exorsus the guys who code ERT addon. these are the cream of the crop smart folk.<br />
<br />
This exactly. They raided more time in a single day than most people would in multiple. Of course guilds that do stuff like that are going to get through content faster. Add that on top of the fact they've been raid testing every aspect of multiple accounts in the dungeon and you get this. Why do people keep thinking just becuase the &quot;world first&quot; tier of raiding guilds accomplishing something means the game as a whole, or blizzard, is bad. It just means some people can accomplish stuff that other's can't in the same time frame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because the avreage guilds haven't beta tested the bossed and don't have the dedication it takes to min/max their performance.<br />
<br />
you simply can not deny that this race would have taken much longer without the average item level of those guild being allready above the hc-EN loottable.<br />
<br />
Those guys struggled really much with il'gynoth and most of their hunter (the class I'm playing and following) chnaged their enchancts to a more aoe damage boost. (from satyr to a ´straight +300 mastery) and probably other classes did that as well. Without the ilvl boost people would probably not have managed to K.O. those bossed that fast.<br />
<br />
Method and Serenity for example fist cleared hc EN to upgrade thier gear beforehand. (which is a common thing to do for top guild since usually the bosses require some really high hps and dps output and every little boost can help with that) Exorsus gambled and jumped straigth into mythic. It payed of at the end but kida shows you that the devs probably never thought about that people would outgear their mythic content by farming m+ titnaforged gear witin the first week. (because the normla loot was capped at 850 and only warforged/titanforged could reach a higher level)</div></div><hr />

You should not be able to clear the hardest difficulty in 24 hours. I understand that EN isnt a tier raid, and it might be alot easier than Nighthold, but it look likes it severely undertuned. But maybe it was Blizzards intention, since you almost can outgear the raid with all that gear that can drop from almost everything. I wish Blizzard will tune the shit out of Gul'Dan or something, so we dont se a kill after a month or so, or maybe add limited attempts like ICC.<br />

<br />
Because some guilds are better than others or have invested significant time practicing these mechanics/strategies. The point I would raise isn't that mythic+ destroyed the race; it's that the content itself is clearly undertuned for the ilvl people have going into mythic.</div></div><hr />

You should not be able to clear the hardest difficulty in 24 hours. I understand that EN isnt a tier raid, and it might be alot easier than Nighthold, but it look likes it severely undertuned. But maybe it was Blizzards intention, since you almost can outgear the raid with all that gear that can drop from almost everything. I wish Blizzard will tune the shit out of Gul'Dan or something, so we dont se a kill after a month or so, or maybe add limited attempts like ICC.<br />
<br />
But congratz to Exorsus.<br />
<br />
I think they did not undertune it they simply forgot about m+ gear. They did not want you to get 850+ gear out of m+ unless it got upgraded to warforge/titanforged. Those guilds grinded the shi out of m+. Method for example streamed 7 days a week for 12-16 hours a day them clearing m+2-4 with 3 chests. This is what most guild did.<br />
<br />
Those mythic EN bossed got tuned for 865-870. (quite likely but don't quote me on that)<br />
<br />
Those top tier raiding guild allready got an average gearscore of 865+. Those guild were able to go for first kills with 10-15 ilvls below the requiremtns in the past what did they expect would happen if those guys match the gear requiremtns within the first day?<br />
<br />
I dont think that the next content will be done within less than 24hours but wihin the first 1-2 weeks is quite likely. This time m+ simply won the race but the times of 6+ weeks for the finla boss are most likely over. (unless blizzard does a 180° and decides to go less casual again) because 6weeks for the top10 means 2-3 months for the average progress guild and a maybe next content for the casual raiders.</div></div><hr />

this raid is a joke<br />
<br />
the easiest raid in wow history?<br />
<br />
lol, are you joking? You talk about the absolute top of WoW raiders, that have done alpha and beta of the raid for months. It will take much longer time before your average guild manage to finish this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the bosses are probably tuned just fine but guys like exorsus, method, serenity, etc. farmed the shit out of m+ and those guilds got average ilvls of 865+ (EN hc is 865) so they bosses were tuned just fine but the m+ titanforged/warforged drops kinda flawed the whole ilvl requirments.<br />
<br />
Don't forget those guilds were able to clear the highest difficulties with 10-15 ilvls below the minimum requiremnts due them playing close to perfect if you give them the gear beforehand then it's quite likely that they clear the content fster than ever.<br />
<br />
Those guilds beta tested the shit out of EN and got the general tactics down allready. They &quot;only&quot; have to do some fine tuning and work on thier execution.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilian</div><div class="date">2016-09-29, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Naxx was cleared on day one by extremely undergeared people and that says something about it (25). Meanwhile this is the first time we see top tier raid groups dealing with Mythic without being severely undergeared (all of them in the running have gear better than HC EN and probably a trait or two more than Blizz designed the fight for). I think it was less about brute forcing the encounter and more about Exorsus coming with the best strategy faster than everyone else.<br />
<br />
It's exactly the other way around. They did &quot;brute force&quot; the encounter with gear. If you have more gear you have to fine tune your strategies less.<br />
<br />
Imagine, if they are better geared for Mythic raids than in previous expansions then how overgeared must everyone else be for all the other content compared to those other expansions where it was already out of control. Maybe that's good, maybe that's bad but at least it's not for me to steamroll through content and be bored really fast and then having to grind through all that content to find a little bit of content that is not boring which is not worth it. <br />
<br />
And sorry to say but clearing mythic within 24 hours is way too fast. That they devote their lives to this isn't an argument because guilds have been doing that for years and I don't really remember a lot of raids that were cleared this fast. I saw someone say Naxx 25 got cleared in a day too by undergeared players. True, because it was a undertuned, rehashed raid without hardcore/heroic/mythic mode and they already cleared it in a previous expansion so they knew all the strategies. It was a huge mistake of Blizzard imo. Naxx 25 was an entry level raid without multiple difficulties, now we have multiple difficulties and there is really no excuse for the hardest difficulty to be cleared this fast by anyone.<br />
<br />

Srsly wth? <br />
They obviously put a lot of effort and time into the game, they are obviously skilled players, and they were first to kill Xavius on mythic. <br />

Now these two stopped hardcore raiding, so Exorsus naturally moves into a world first favorite position.<br />
<br />
What does surprise me is that Mythic race is over almost before it began. I mean come on, final boss dead in under 24 hours? Highmaul was also a 7-boss raid but Imperator Mar'gok didn't died until the last day of the reset!<br />
<br />
I guess it's because all this Titanforged bullshit. Cmon, getting 885+ gear off world quests when mythic drops 880 base? This is just stupid. The world first players always had to do the encounters severely undergeared compared to everybody else. Now they had gear which will be available to a typical mythic guild reaching those bosses.<br />
<br />
A typical guild in 868 gear would need some weeks to progress on this instance on mythic and would eventually get it done.<br />
A top tier guild in 868 gear just smashes the instance into tiny shreds in 17 hours. Cos these are some of the best players WoW has ever seen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It seems like it is severely undertuned.<br />
<br />
When is the last time this happened? Can't remember. I don't think it has. They cleared the entire raid in less than 24 hours on THE hardest difficulty in game.<br />
<br />
Granted it might be a bit undertuned, Its literally Highmaul 2.0 (yes it took longer to clear but im speaking about content wise)<br />
It's not a tier raid and its not the last raid patch, <br />
Sure people thought it was &quot;nice&quot; paragon got w1 in HM, but lets face it, the second Method got w1 in the TIER raid, HM and paragons first in there was nonsense.<br />
This is the same shit, It's nice they got a w1, and yes it might be undertuned, but get real, its nothing than a filler brag before tier raid comes out.<br />
<br />
also iirc Mogu'shan Vaults was cleared same day.<br />
<br />
<br />
All of the other top guilds had the same overall ilvl in their rosters going in, they're all only 5/7 Mythic atm. Pretty fair competition tbf.<br />
<br />
I dont think you can look at it that way anymore due to so many ilvl boosts on same item. <br />
One guild could of had 5 strong classes with 4 more ilvls on their weapons or a strong trinket and a few ilvl lower on a neck and helmet, meanwhile another guild has the oposite due to RNG on titanforged. They will show the average of same but one will still be stronger than the other.</div></div><hr />

Well, it certainly looks like it was undertuned compared to past raids, but if it was THAT undertuned, Midwinter/US guilds would have gotten the world first being one day ahead. Seems legit to think Exorsus are just that good at playing the game^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most guilds weren't near their itemlevel when trying to progress through mythic in previous expansions either. How is this not a measurement of how hard content is? Everyone is playing the same game. Top guilds don't buy a cheatcode so they have an advantage over others, they are just faster and smarter like ALWAYS.<br />
<br />
Since when is the speed at wich content gets cleared and the amount of times it gets cleared not a good measurement of how hard the content is?</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue isn't that the raid might be undertuned but rather than the battle system in the game, heavily designed with solo play in mind, doesn't allow for meaningful group PVE anymore (ask yourselves where being in a raid, on the emerald nightmare encounters, is actually more interesting on a macro gameplay standpoint that if the encounter was tuned for 5 man). Additionally, the loot system of mythic + dungeons (that you can run a very large number of time) allows for players to circumvent the difficulty of current mythic raids, which are the individual output requirements of the players in the raid.</div></div><hr />
