Butt dont hurt no, just stating the facts, we run insanity every week so it will come with some luck.<br />
Was the same when I had Immortal and got the drake, that bit of luck made the difference and the longer time pass the less this achievement is worth due to gearing up to become overgered. Then not even luck is part of it anymore :)</div></div><hr />

Yup. The dot stays even after the fight. That happened to one of our healers on a 10man Insanity run, he wanted to look at loot and forgot he had a debuff on himself. The other healer did the same :P</div></div><hr />

not to bust your balls or anything, If you actually looked at his toon profile thats in his signature you'd see that he is a US player.<br />
<br />
ANYWAYS, Congrats to Might, nice to see a guild other than the typical 2-3 getting a US First.</div></div><hr />

It's funny because only 1 guild has done it for EU aswell, and it's really not like 25 people represent a whole continent.<br />
<br />
So really get over yourselves, do this achievement yourself and then you can be happy and say what you want to say, otherwise say gratz or say nothing.<br />
<br />
Gratz Might.<br />

Was the same when I had Immortal and got the drake, that bit of luck made the difference and the longer time pass the less this achievement is worth due to gearing up to become overgered. Then not even luck is part of it anymore :)<br />

<br />
jut read the achivement info.........fuc***g insane....i wonder what is harder the VoA achivement or this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Immortality is far more harder than the VoA achi, which is p**s easy. Only reason that there are so few guilds that have done E,W&amp;F is because only a handful of the guilds who are more than capable of doing it have actually bothered with it. I'd say that even Insanity is harder than EWF, but then again some may find EWF harder than Insanity, depends on the guild.<br />
<br />
Oh, and before someone tries to claim I haven't done EWF/will never be able to do it:<br />

How long is the achievement on the screen for? It can't more than a couple seconds, in which time I doubt all the healers celebrated and decided to let ppl die. I'm not sure if their UI lists raid deaths, but I don't see it in chat either, which means it could have happened as the achievements were handed out. At least my UI is set up that way.<br />

<br />
<br />
Everyone who is rational and understanding &quot;knew&quot; what happened but all the alarmist idiots saw Dead on the raid frames and went &quot;LoL EXPLOIT / BUG. INSANE SKILL AND EXECUTION EXPLANATION INC.&quot;<br />
<br />
Mystery was a bad choice of words but it is always nice to confirm what everyone already knows. Also it's rather sad that a few buggy kills / exploits have tainted world first kills to such a degree that guilds have to constantly defend their kills to such an inordinate extent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keeping everyone alive for every encounter most certainly takes a degree of skill above average &quot;farming&quot;. This achievement is not the ruler by which all skill should be measured, but it's still an accomplishment nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Why are people fighting over this? The WoW community is such a cesspool. WTB Everquest community circa '99.<br />
<br />
Grats Might, whether you think it's significant or not, they still accomplished something, so everyone just chill and say grats or nothing at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
congratz anyways.<br />
<br />
Sorry for being cynical here, but people who freak out over missing an achievement with that margin rather than just saying &quot;oh well, better luck next reset&quot; don't get close to getting such an achievement in the first place. It's about the mindset. My last guild, for example, were really shaky and nervous during KT on our World (insert number of guilds in the world -1) Undying. People fucked up due to nervosity and if we hadn't been overgeared enough to eat it, we'd fail. People would cry, I would turn mike off and lol at them.<br />
And yes - there's a HUGE HUGE difference between US first TtIm than a very delayed undying, I know :P. Just stating that moral of the story is that people who'd rage over being very close yet failing aren't really the people set to do those harder flawless run-achievements in the first place.<br />
<br />
That being said, I'd lol too if that happened :D. Despite that a guild like them probably wouldn't rage.<br />

It was horrible in naxx, and it sucks ass in ToGC. In terms of which guild is better than the other to me, immortal and insanity doesn't show anything. In some of those fights (especially anub) so much can go wrong, and your entire progression for that week in a split second of lag, one raider's cat jumping on the keyboard, you name it. It's just not cool...<br />
<br />
To me what counts is first kills on anub, not skills, not mad skills, not insanity, not immortallity, first kills. Raiding is (or at least should be imo) about progression, hence first kills, not how effeciently you farm something. Not saying it doesn't require skill to obtain these achievements, but it's just not what raiding has been about in the past, and most likely will be in the future since they removed it again in ICC.<br />

One thing I would be interested in knowing though is did they aim to go for that achievement or were they simply Farming through the instance and after downing Anu they realised &quot;oh wait no one has died yet&quot;<br />

It doesn't take skill to do 25 man ToGC without anyone dying? Bullshit. Obviously you have to farm some gear to be able to do it, that's why all 5 bosses weren't introduced at once.<br />

Posting your armory should be a requirement to QQ.

ToC was interesting in that the first guilds to get Skill, Mad Skill, and Insanity were those who learned the encounters and refined their strategies the quickest (that is in the fewest number of attempts) rather than those who could just keep repeating it over and over with no penalty as in past raids. 50 attempts was probably too lenient, but even the first guild that cleared ToGC-25 had only a handful attempts remaining, and with soulstone exploits.</div></div><hr />
