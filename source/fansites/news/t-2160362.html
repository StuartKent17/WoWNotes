Several new quests were added in Patch 7.2, including new profession quests! These quests have you collect materials before you can craft the new legendary items. <br />

Patch 7.2 - Crafted Legendary Items<br />
The new crafted legendary items currently don't have a proc. All of them require 65 x Blood of Sargeras (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124124-blood-of-sargeras), profession specific materials, legendary materials from the above quest line, and a Felessence Legion-Flask (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146659-felessence-legion-flask).<br />
<br />
The Flask has creation spells in the database, being upgraded from an Empty Felessence Vessel (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146655-empty-felessence-vessel) to the Felessence Legion-Flask (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146659-felessence-legion-flask) through Uncommon (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146656-felessence-vessel), Rare (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146657-felessence-phial), Epic (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146658-felessence-phylactery), and finally a legendary version (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/146659-felessence-legion-flask). <br />

Developer Communication<br />
If only the class balance Devs in WoW listened to the community like the Devs in Overwatch. et al are way too prideful to care.<br />
.I'm honestly really curious where this idea comes from. What gives this impression? Is it because we talk through WarcraftDevs? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820025185201860613))<br />
(As opposed to as individual developers through personal accounts) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820025310292783104))<br />
<br />
I can just see how someone might think the OW team is more responsive. I do really like their community team.<br />
Absolutely. I agree with all of this. WoW and Overwatch are different games, and so communication styles for one... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820038428414746625))<br />
...may not work as well for the other. Like for us, the communication that our most engaged players really want... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820038674154856448))<br />
...is spec-specific, resulting in it taking 36x as long to get to everyone. Much harder to provide value to all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820039175583870977))<br />
<br />
Truly and honestly, something is not being communicated properly to the Devs via CM's. Wh… https://t.co/hDuHQuBggm<br />
I don't think anyone on either side disagrees that more communication is desired/needed. It's just an *extremely* hard problem. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820026571444482049))<br />
As a developer myself I don't see how hard it is to take 30 mins of your time everyday to actually read… https://t.co/JnK3Pb2zBf<br />
You are *sorely* mistaken if you don't think we spend at least 30min of our day reading feedback. Probably between 2-10x that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820027645307981824))<br />
Problem is, there are 36 specs, each of which have vital feedback. Just reading feedback takes time, let alone responding to it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820027813788909568))<br />
is it too much to ask the designers to post on class forums weekly to discuss whats going on in the team?<br />
A weekly update on every class, let alone every spec, would likely consume &gt;20% of our dev time. Hard to justify. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/820049644998664192))<br />

Hi,are Odyn's golden valkyrs made of Light since they use Light spells while the Lich King's dark valkyrs beings of Shadow?<br />
Lich King subjugated valkyr and converted them to servants of the Scourge. As opposed to creating brand new ones. (Alex_Afrasiabi (https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/819948739179606016))<br />
I see. Could you confirm that the Odyn's golden valkyrs are made of Light as suggested ingame by their Light spells and all?<br />
Light is source of life on Azeroth. Safe to say that they are affected in some way by it, as are all (most) living things (Alex_Afrasiabi (https://twitter.com/Alex_Afrasiabi/status/819997216181891072))<br />

Upcoming Legendary Changes<br />
I have thoroughly enjoyed most aspects of legion. I consider myself a top tier raider, however im not able to play at a high level because of the rng on top of rng legendary system. Ive been benched in 2 guilds because of it and ended up taking a break for 3 weeks due to frustration. Many others and myself included have had the displeasure of receiving 3 utility legendary in a row. This has to be the most terrible experience, I've had in all the years I've played wow (since early vanilla).<br />
<br />
Blizzard, id really like to stress this, ill say it again. I cant begin to explain to you how terrible it feels to players, who have received 3 non dps increase legendary in a row. How can this amount of in-game tragedy be allowed? It is disgusting. You have created an incredible expansion, don't you have any pride? Why hasn't something, anything been done about this? Please, respond! Anything!<br />
There are a fair number of additions/tweaks in 7.2 to the legendary system. They've not been introduced on PTR yet but they are coming and this is something we will be actively seeking feedback on. Some of the issues that you highlight are things that we are hoping to ameliorate with these changes.<br />
<br />
Please have patience with us as we roll out new quest/feature content on PTR next week and then move into rolling out the item/reward/systems changes. It is a bit of staged progressive rollout to focus testing and feedback but there are additional changes coming. <br />
<br />
Please continue to supply feedback throughout this process though. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/795641-blizzard-read-this-how-can-you-allow-this/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20753095273?page=1#20))<br />

Frost Mage - Brain Freeze<br />
The counter then is when you follow a frostbolt with an Ebonbolt. Right now the brain freeze proc happens quick enough to abort the cast. If it's delayed I'd be much further along and it would be a bigger dps loss to cancel.<br />
<br />
Edit: not trying to be difficult, just want to avoid getting a new problem.<br />
Stating again that this is not a fully-formed plan yet, but to make sure I was clear: my expectation in that case is that you would cast Frostbolt-&gt;Ebonbolt-&gt;Flurry-&gt;Ice Lance-&gt;Flurry-&gt;Ice Lance (where Ebonbolt's Brain Freeze appears a split-second after the first Flurry). We would not want it to be optimal to abort the Ebonbolt cast, in any case.

so yes they should be BoE but the legendary parts are required to upgrade them and make them legendary, otherwise it's retarded forcing everyone to craft their own gear, that hasn't been a thing since like tbc?</div></div><hr />

So 15 exclusive mage legendaries...even if you got one a week it would take almost six months to get them all...really it would be 4.5-5 calendar months(which is still a long time). Now, getting to why it works in Diablo...In diablo there's hundreds of legendaries...they also relatively change your build even if slightly. It creates different ways to play. That is the exact opposite of what Legion legendaries are doing. They are forcing you to stay one spec or one build. Mostly because, they don't drop frequently enough to encourage changing anything up. Everyone who plays 10 hours a week at this point should honestly really have most of their legendaries...yes it reduces the meaning behind getting one....but I would much rather than than the garbage fire that is the current legendary system.</div></div><hr />

This isn't all people care about. I just use my professions for my self. I have no interest in using them to make money. I'd prefer I got the option to craft something to help myself than to to make gold. Yes, I understand I could use the gold to buy gear but the process of getting the gold bores the crap out of me.</div></div><hr />

I'd at the very least wait to see what kind of legendary-effects they bring before making claims like that.<br />
But to each his own i guess...</div></div><hr />

Everyone is entitled to everything it seems these days<br />
<br />
I thought they wanted to remove all profession perks. Now they put them back with 2nd class legendaries. WTF is this?<br />
<br />
At least, the cloth shoulder armour has the right stats for my main...<br />

Blizzard stated that crafted legendaries would have no effects.</div></div><hr />

Also the impact is considerably different depending on the profession and your armor class. At least they balanced the stat budget for all 4 equally.. which in turn makes the &quot;weaker&quot; pieces more interesting in some slots. <br />
<br />
These might as well have been epic pieces..</div></div><hr />

<br />
the amount of times i use the amazing crafted engineering helms......Kappa.<br />
<br />
so yes they should be BoE but the legendary parts are required to upgrade them and make them legendary, otherwise it's retarded forcing everyone to craft their own gear, that hasn't been a thing since like tbc?<br />
<br />
<br />
Main: Mail user with herbalism/mining...am I doing it wrong?:P<br />
Alt: Plate user with jewelcrafting/alchemy....wrong again? :P<br />
<br />
Or perhaps Blizz again (as always) far away from reality?<br />
<br />
What i ment was those people are druids but have tailoring and warriors with LW etc, having em BoE would be bad regardless.</div></div><hr />

Sorry still no sense....I have a warlock with skinning and LW..why? Because i wanted to try a lock and did not have any skinning/lw alt, so i wanted to try that one as well..You imply cloth users must to get tailoring because it`s useful for them...but once more: what about mining/jc as mage? Anythhing wrong or illogical with that? Herbalism/inscription az rogue....illogical in any way? No...once more: it`s just the idiocracy of Blizz...Btw my question about your comment: HOW?<br />
<br />
Same like with the Blood of Sargeras..&quot;no, we don`t want to make it boa...instead you can buy whatever you want and send it or sell it to anyone&quot;....makes lot more sense...</div></div><hr />

how would you ideally want traps to work? (Muffinus)<br />
<br />
I never had concrete proof that Muffinus was stupid, but this is pretty damn close if not completely concrete.<br />
<br />
&quot;SV doesn't feel good now that traps don't work [like they used to]&quot;<br />
&quot;Lol how should they work then?&quot;<br />
&quot;...like they used to?&quot;</div></div><hr />

Or make a vendor that trades 2 or even 3 unlucky drops for 1 good one ? <br />
Sooo many good idea's on the forums , but noooo lets dream up some dumb solution that we can call our own . Great job dev's !!:rolleyes:<br />

WoW will always be one of my favorite games of all time, but the new devs have shown time and again they have literally no idea what they are doing. At this point it's either they can't fix the issues or won't fix the issues, I am not sure which is worse.</div></div><hr />
