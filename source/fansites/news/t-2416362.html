Epic Battlegrounds Feedback<br />
Thanks for the lively discussion, everyone! Some updates:<br />
<br />
Alterac Valley<br />
We feel Alterac Valley is in a pretty decent spot. We've seen a dip in Alliance win rates, but want to give them time to re-adjust and strategize after the changes. We'll continue to monitor things and make changes where necessary. <br />
<br />
We realize players have a passion for some of Alterac Valley's classic mechanics (Ivus, Lokholar). While we have no immediate changes to announce yet, its something we may adjust in the future.<br />
<br />
Isle of Conquest<br />
We've identified an issue with the Keep Cannons dealing too much damage to vehicles. We believe this is causing defense to be stronger than intended. We are going to significantly reduce the damage the Keep Cannons deal to vehicles, but still retain their power against players.<br />
<br />
Some other additional changes:<br />
<br />
<br />
When a gate is destroyed, that faction will lose 50 Reinforcements. This will give offense an option of destroying more gates if the opposing team is &quot;turtling.&quot; The Siege Engine will now be immune to roots and snares. Health of the Glaive Towers and Demolishers moderately increased. Damage and siege damage of the Airship Cannons significantly increased.<br />
<br />
We hope to have these changes live soon, and appreciate your continued feedback. <br />
<br />
Thank You!<br />

The Evolution of World of Warcraft Storytelling<br />
ScienceAlert (https://www.sciencealert.com/world-of-warcraft-lore-storytelling-history-future-evolution-alex-afrasiabi-interview-part-1) has a three part interview with Alex Afrasiabi about the evolution of storytelling in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
Alex Afrasiabi started with only eight months left before shipping the game.<br />
There were only four or five people adding quests to the game, so there wasn't an overarching story.<br />
Other games at the time, such as Everquest, didn't have a lot of quests.<br />
The goal of quests was to guide players through the zones and have them explore the world, all while telling a story.<br />
Quest designers weren't in charge of spawning NPCs, so they had to work with what was already spawned. <br />
In the final months before shipping, everyone realized that not letting quest designers do spawning was inefficient so quest designers added spawning to part of their process. <br />
Moving from Classic to Burning Crusade, quest designers being allowed to spawn things was what allowed quest storylines to become more cohesive and coherent.<br />
That change opened the floodgates for quest designers to tell more concise and directed stories, because they actually now controlled what the world looked like.<br />
Alex pitched putting machinima in the game during Wrath of the Lich King, resulting in Wrathgate!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Some people actually do like slow leveling. That's not the issue here, though. The problem was Blizzard bringing everyone down to that level. No one had a choice.<br />
<br />
One valid solution would've been providing heirlooms with no experience boost while buffing the experience on the ones that do. That way, slow levelers can level slowly still enjoying the benefits of heirlooms while fast levelers can zoom up comfortably.<br />
<br />
Another valid solution would've been Blizzard stop nerfing the various methods people have found to level easily. That was just a kick in the nuts on top of the leveling nerf.</div></div><hr />

If you want fun quests why are you leveling in BC zones at all?</div></div><hr />

<br />
This isn't an issue with the squish. That is those zones being old. Separate issue. I do think they should merge all zones into one bracket after 60. I'd also be in favor of a level squish back to 60. Cata zones 1-30. Chose any expansion to level in 30-60. 60-70 for 9.0 content. Levels would likely be a bit slower, but they could do soemthing with 60 levels instead of 120. Every 5 levels you get a major talent. Every 10 levels you get a Prime talent which is what we currently have. Every 1 level you get a minor stat increase/warlods style change to a spell/new spell. Major talents are things like major glyphs and you pick from a list like the pvp talents do now.<br />
<br />
1-60(now 1-30) would let you do about 4 or 5 Vanilla zones, while 30-60 would be achievable with 2 full expansions worth of leveling. So Complete Pandaria and Warlords to catch up to 9.0.</div></div><hr />

I've been working on loremaster lately and had to go through there. I'm not really asking for them to be fun fun but it'd be nice for the questing not to be so painful.</div></div><hr />

I find the idea of Classic getting more players than Live a bit amusing, considering all the rage at Pathfinder &quot;gating&quot; flying while Vanilla had no flying, but the grind to afford a decent mount at all was not an insignificant task either.</div></div><hr />

I think i'd prefer them to allow us to use old zones to 100. I'd love to quest through most of the classic zones to at least 100.</div></div><hr />

They wouldn't bother unless it was at least like 5%. I'd imagine its going to be somewhere in the 10-20% range.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. A quest-worth of experience reduction at levels in which you need 300k to level up is hardly a change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh, I think there will by a huge, server crushing explosion of players when Classic hits. So long as they don't do something stupid like try and charge $60 for it. But the number of those players who hit 30, let alone 60, will be laughably small for the first six months. Hell, I'm not sure I'm going to make it an anything approaching a timely manner (or at all) and I've wanted an official vanilla server since wrath.</div></div><hr />

My gripe is that questing isn't difficult at all, and the quests themselves are boring and monotonous. <br />

To be honest I think it is nice to be able to complete an expansions zones. Even in the current state you cant. Solution isnt to increase leveling time, but to let players go where they want from a lower level. If I could get from 60-110 herever I wanted, I wouldnt mind leveling super fast. It just sucks to go to the Jade forrest, complete half the zone, and leave for WoD. It was literally like that before. Thats idiotic.</div></div><hr />

Oh, I do too. That's why I'm saying, allow us to do that. Allow the super slow levelers to level slow. Allow the medium pacers to go at a medium pace. Etc.. But I have a level 110 of every class on both factions. I am currently attempting to do each of the 4 new subraces. I have done it all. I don't mind that I am no longer in God mode with heirlooms. But leveling feels SUPER slow now. But I have experienced all the zones, all their storylines. I feel like I am being penalized for having done everything already.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Blizzard, my 35 level 110s thank you from the bottom of their heart. Leveling was too grindy, too long, and not meant for the current state of the game. <br />
<br />
The people that wanted it to stay taking forever, are the same people that have leveled to max maybe twice, and shouldn't speak for people who have been playing for 10 years. No one wants to spend hours in Outlands and Northrend. Good changes are good</div></div><hr />

They claim &quot;some people like it as is&quot;. Awesome. Then the LOGICAL fix would be to double or triple the amount of bonus xp from heirlooms. Wanna level slow? Take them all off! They're not even BiS anymore. Wanna level medium pace? Wear only 3 or 4 pieces! Wanna level at warp speed? Wear them all. It seems pretty easy. But then, I'm using LOGIC. Something our dear devs seem short on at the moment. I don't blame them, though. I guarantee you there will be whining now that leveling is too easy. They just cannot seem to win with this community.<br />
<br />
New players don't have access to heirlooms. You can't just expect a new player to go through 110 levels, which atleast 90 levels of it is boring outdated crap, for a long time. <br />
I hope it's a big nerf, something like 25 percent.</div></div><hr />

In TBC the average was 5 to 7 days / 120 to 168 hours played to level from 1 to 70. It was no where near as fast as it is today.</div></div><hr />

I am fairly certain that most players who have already been through the content multiple times were the ones complaining. You have quite a few of them as mythic raiders, questing holds no joy for them.<br />

Mythic raiders can skip leveling for the most part by using their gold to buy tokens and trade them in for a boost. Currently a boost is only 1 mil gold.<br />
If you are leveling solely for the ugly ass heritage armor, then suck it up champ because you will be rewarded for leveling normally.</div></div><hr />

it took me most of the last week to go from 20 to 48. I double checked played time and its 16 hours - that's WITH almost full heirlooms (I'm missing fishing ring) as far as i'm aware (and experiencing) it will only keep getting slower. given that i'm using looms it should be faster than leveling in BC. but it sure doesn't feel that way. i cannot say how much it would take to go from lvl 1 to 20 to add to above number, as at this time, i'm only leveling allied races. all i can say is... it feels incredibly tedious. maybe its redesigned in cata quests. they are supposed to be more interesting and fun, but so far its still mostly variation on &quot;gather 10 bear butts&quot; with 60% of the bears apparently running around buttless.<br />
<br />
whoever decided that this is better? i don't know what to tell you. i like it that I can finish the zone and still level while staying in it. I can't say i'm enjoying how long EVERYTHING is taking though.</div></div><hr />

It took me between 20 and 24 hours to get to level 20 in vanilla and tbc sped leveling up by 30% from 1-60.<br />
Blizzards goal at the time was that level 1-60 in vanilla was as fast as leveling 1-70 in TBC.<br />
So in TBC you needed 14 to 17 hours to get to level 20.<br />
Today you start your allied race at 20 or it takes you 4-6 hours to get to level 20. (at least at the time when everyone tried to unlock Lady Liadrin in hearthstone)</div></div><hr />

Boohoo I don't have time to play video games, yet I chose the most time-consuming genre and I expect devs will cater to my &quot;adult&quot; needs. Giving effort? Gaining skills? Investing time into a video game? What am I? A BASEMENT-DWELLING MANCHILD? Get out of your mother's house once in a while and party or do something productive.<br />

30-45 hours? admittedly when I did it I was sort of aimless in my approach, but it took me somewhere around 120-160 hours for my 60's back then lol. and that was with a group of friends to plow through dungeons and group quests...</div></div><hr />

that i don't know what to say. maybe its rose tinted glasses. but I do not remember it feeling THIS tedious back then. and again, with heirlooms at least, it SHOULD be faster. it just doesn't feel faster. and it certainly doesn't feel faster today vs 2 days ago, despite them claiming leveling hotfix.<br />

sorry if it posts twice, I tried replying and it didn't seem to take at the time? <br />

P.S. huh... so there is that post after all, apparently I just ended up quoting you twice in a single post. go figure.<br />

anyways, i don't know what to say, but... it didn't feel that tedious back then. it should be faster now, but it doesn't feel faster and it certainly doesn't feel faster then 2 days ago, despite claims of hotfix<br />

that said, wasn't unlocking Lady Liadrin happening BEFORE they nerf hammered leveling speeds? so it would taken longer then 4-6 hours to get to 20 today.</div></div><hr />

It is practically close to 3 less levels when it comes to time spent between 60-80. Not that it did bother me much since I actually like to level in TBC/Wrath zones, but anything that speeds up leveling is welcome imo :P And good that they reduce it for most levels. 40 to 60 is for me a lot more tedious than 60 to 80. I am gonna level a zandalari for the heritage, and I was not looking forward to it. Now it feels a tad better :&gt;</div></div><hr />

I find that the pathfinder is something of a good thing and a bad thing. Sometimes it feels like a drag to do, but at the end you feel good for completing something that took a while to do and not just given to you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I love pathfinder and think it's the best system to gain flying they've had so far, but I do think at the end of the expansion its requirements should be stripped down to just doing the story content and maybe the Explorer achievement. Once an expansion is over there's really no need to extend it with the addition of rep grinding. Especially since since Pathfinder became a thing rep has been a lot more of a slog than in the past.</div></div><hr />

I will say that vanilla dungeons are WAY overtuned, especially in comparison to Northrend and BC dungeons where stuff just falls over.</div></div><hr />
