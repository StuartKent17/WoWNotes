Greetings, 
 
You may have noticed we've been doing some updates to Alterac Valley and Isle of Conquest recently. Our goals with these changes are to both improve the gameplay experience in these battlegrounds and to also design them around a longer duration format.

Greetings,<br />
<br />
You may have noticed we've been doing some updates to Alterac Valley and Isle of Conquest recently. Our goals with these changes are to both improve the gameplay experience in these battlegrounds and to also design them around a longer duration format. We feel that with the longer match length, players have more room to switch strategies in a match, change from offense to defense a few times, etc. to provide a, well, more epic experience.<br />
<br />
With that, we're looking to you to give us feedback on these changes.<br />
<br />
Here are some of the changes recently (through hotfixes, so they are very recent):<br />
<br />
Alterac Valley<br />
<br />
Increased the number of Reinforcements by 100. The NPCs health and damage will match the players level and gear, which will result in a more consistent difficulty.<br />
<br />
Isle of Conquest<br />
<br />
Increased the number of Reinforcements by 100. Increased the health of the walls significantly. Increased the damage the Siege Engine, Demolishers, Glaive Throwers and Keep Cannons deal against players. (The Seige Engine in particular will now be pretty scary!) Increased the siege damage dealt by the Siege Engine and Demolisher. (The Ram ability will deal a lot of damage in particular) The Refinery and the Quarry now generate Reinforcements more frequently. Increased the health of the &quot;bosses&quot;.<br />
<br />
We welcome your feedback! Please focus your feedback on the gameplay in the map, in particular the pacing, balance of different mechanics etc. <br />
<br />
Thank You.<br />
<br />

This Week in WoW History<br />
We're taking a look back at old MMO-Champion posts and World of Warcraft news that occurred during this time in previous years.<br />
<br />
Stormcrow<br />
In 2013 the model for a new mount appeared in the game files. The Stormcrow as theorized to be a mount either added in Patch 5.4 or in the upcoming expansion, much like the Enchanted Fey Dragon. This stormy, dark-blue mount never made it into the game, however the Solar Spiderhawk, and the Violet Spellwing ended up using the same model.<br />

<br />
Horde Chopper<br />
After the series “Azeroth Choppers” was complete, the votes were counted, and the winner was selected. Following up on their promise, Blizzard rewarded Horde players who logged in within a specific time window with the Horde Chopper once Warlords of Draenor was released.<br />
<br />

<br />
Overwatch Legacy<br />
With the release of numerous teasers about the upcoming game, Overwatch, many content creators set out to making some awesome videos. A group of cosplayers created a live action trailer for the game, featuring a battle between Tracer and Reaper.<br />
<br />

<br />
The Grand Tournament<br />
Hearthstone’s fourth expansion, The Grand Tournament, had a short trailer released that featured some of the upcoming cards. This expansion brough 132 new cards, and the new Inspire! Mechanic, which was triggered whenever the players used their hero power.<br />

<br />
Auction House Dance Party<br />
After the introduction of micro-holidays, the Auction House Dance Party was the newest addition. In this event the Auction House is decorated with a disco stage and speakers. For the duration of the event players should use the secondary Auction House in the major cities, or join the party.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huehuehue</div><div class="date">2018-07-28, 12:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm not so sure these are good changes for participation, since it feels like the majority of the playerbase has been go-go-go for quite some time. These are definitely good changes for the epic BGs themselves, and the players that enjoy them. This does seem like the next logical step after separating the categories, restoring their length and scope to previous intended designs by hacking away at the changes they made over the years to fit the go-go-go's</div></div><hr />

overwatch... uhhh what? i play all the game but why is a thing to do with overwatch and overwatch alone in the &quot;this week in wow history&quot; hearthstone i understand but...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, either I'm unlucky or people don't listen, but most of the Epic BGs I've done, the Horde wins. I know, bias, but it sure feels weird.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Spazlord</div><div class="date">2018-07-28, 02:13 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good changes. You queue for them deliberately now so you sign up for a long battle.<br />
<br />
I find horde win AV a fair bit, alliance seem to play the dumber strat (no towers) and if they don't get a miracle win they lose real slow.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Railander</div><div class="date">2018-07-28, 03:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">did they nerf tower cannon damage to vehicles? i did IoC last night and when we finally got the siege engine it got 3-shot by a tower cannon.</div></div><hr />

Make a change. Seriously though be interesting to see how AV plays out with the new changes.</div></div><hr />

If the preferred tactic in AV continues to be zerg.... then Blizzard has failed at the above stated goals.</div></div><hr />

Battle groups havent been a thing for years. Figured I'd let you know lol</div></div><hr />

Horde win rates are through the roof (because it's only people that want to be there and Alliance are bad at adapting) and games are easily lasting an hour or more. I've seen more Lok and Ivus in one night than I have in two years.</div></div><hr />

Don't you mean Spirehawk? 'Cuz Spiderhawk sounds a lot cooler</div></div><hr />

I understand that this isn't something much important for such game, not that it worried me, since I'm not playing and don't plan to play it, but is very symbolic :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
