Frost Death Knight in Patch 7.3<br />
Row 75 on next PTR:<br />
<br />
Inexorable Assault updated to: &quot;While in combat with no enemy within 8 yards, you gain Inexorable Assault every 1 sec. Each stack causes your next autoattack to deal [100%AP] additional Frost damage.&quot;<br />
It's stealing the distance-based mechanic from the proposed White Walker--where we agree it didn't always accomplish as much as we'd want. Also, the attack-based version of IA would likely have been awkward to waterproof against weird rotational shenanigans.<br />
<br />
The third talent, this iteration, will be a version of Volatile Shielding that increases AMS's absorb and RP generation (and nothing else). In keeping with IA--we're experimenting a bit with allowing some damage payoff in a &quot;utility&quot; row in the case of a spec like Frost that isn't getting strong movement bonuses. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/1067136-frost-death-knight-in-73/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20757697601?page=14#268))<br />
<br />
Elemental Discussions - Patch 7.2.5<br />
Few updates--potentially not on the upcoming PTR:<br />
<br />
1) Not going forward with the Maelstrom generation change. It's generally way too much disruption and potentially new problems introduced for something that's meant to be a somewhat minor set of changes in this patch. Given all the feedback that was concerned about the slowdown it would cause on 2-3 targets, it's okay to leave Chain Lightning generating resource so quickly on 5 targets--it's a less bad problem overall, and also what people are already used to on live.<br />
<br />
Reverting the Maelstrom change is also effectively a further buff to Earthquake damage. This should be a clear net buff to steady AoE where Earthquake can be used well (which is not every AoE situation). It may not completely cause Earthquake to surpass Chain Lightning, but it is a big step in that direction. We'll likely tweak numbers further to balance all these concerns/goals. Namely:<br />
--Helping out Earthquake substantially<br />
--Not causing a large buff to AoE damage in steady Earthquake-friendly situations<br />
--Not causing a large nerf to Chain Lightning-only burst (which is a strength that Elemental is used to in Legion)<br />
<br />
2) Slightly buffing Elemental Blast's own damage to mostly cancel out the reduction to the stat buff, as discussed earlier.<br />
<br />
3) Buffing Frost Shock in parallel with Earth Shock. We still need to look into Frost Shock interactions with the 7.3 set bonus if we go forward with that bonus.

<br />
Considering KJ took longer to kill than any other boss, to the point where only one guild killed him after several weeks of all day raiding and it took the second guild over a week later, it's pretty warranted. And we STILL don't have more than 2 guilds that have killed him. I don't even know if most guilds ever would kill it the world's best are still struggling.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much every guild that isn't Method or Exorsus just isn't good enough to kill that boss, hence the nerfs. Basically, anybody not ranked 1 or 2 shall forever have a &quot;post-nerf&quot; KJ kill.<br />

???? What game are you playing? How many guilds in the world-first race used VDHs? What logs are you looking at? By my calculation, these nerfs will be just about enough to drop VDHs below monks and bears for damage, when both of those specs already rank higher for survivability. Meanwhile the 2% buff to Spikes won't solve anything. VDH vulnerability has primarily been when Spikes are down. Increasing recharge rate for Spikes might help, but 2% to their strength not so much.</div></div><hr />

Kudos to Method and Exorsus. They are the best guilds in the world. In their post-WF-kill interview Method folks mentioned 10 nerfs that had to happen for them to be able to kill KJ M.

World first race? Dude no one cares about the world first race. Spirit Bomb and Fracture are just way too powerful compared to the other talents on their respective rows, to a ridiculous amount, it nearly or outright doubles your damage depending on the situation even though Blizzard themselves have stated quite recently that a talent tier should be around 5-10 % increase of your damage, not the insane amounts that Fracture and Spirit Bomb provide.<br />
<br />
<br />
Generally, we aim for talent tiers to be more in the 5-10% range. Very high values can both have distortive effects on the spec and make it hard to balance other talents on the same tier.<br />

<br />
It's exactly as the developer said, very high values causes distortive effects and makes it hard to balance other talents on the same tier, or in this case the base-line of the class itself. A talent should not have this large an impact on a class' performance, which is why I want both Fracture and Spirit Bomb nerfed further, because until they nerf those into the ground they won't improve anything else.</div></div><hr />

If they were buffing something else enough to compensate, I'd be down. But DPS was really the only reason to bring VDH to high end raid. Take that away, and it's back to watching bears and monks get all the work.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On most Ret parses I see those abilities account for around 30% of damage, so a 10% buff results in a 2.5-3.5% overall buff to the spec for single target. On aoe and cleave fights it will be very much less (unless they also buffed Divine Hammer but didn't call it out). Seems pretty lackluster.</div></div><hr />
