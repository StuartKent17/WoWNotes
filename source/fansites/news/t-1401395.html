Alterac Brew Pup - 2013 Charity Pet<br />
It looks like the Alterac Brew-Pup (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/74402-alterac-brew-pup) will be the 2013 Charity pet, with 50% of the purchase price going to the Make-A-Wish Foundation. The charity donation period only lasts until December 31, 2013, similar to the Moonkin Hatchling, which was released on November 29, 2010.<br />
<br />
For an example of what the money goes towards, take a look at our own member Ashkir's story about meeting the President (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1401395-2013-Charity-Pet-Cross-Realm-Account-Bound-Mail-5-4-Hotfixes-Speed-Kill-Rankings?p=23746342&amp;viewfull=1#post23746342) through Make-A-Wish!<br />
<br />
Also keep in mind that the developers revealed (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3548-Blizzcon-2013-Recap) there will be a combo purchase possible with the next charity pet, which includes the Enchanted Fey Dragon (http://www.wowdb.com/items/97989-enchanted-fey-dragon) mount!<br />

Patch 5.4.2 - Cross-Realm Account-Bound Mail<br />
Patch 5.4 enabled mailing between Connected Realms. &lt;span title=&quot;The unannoucned feature!&quot;&gt;Patch 5.4.2 will allow you to mail Account Bound items (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-bind=10) to other realms!&lt;/span&gt;<br />
In the latest 5.4.2 PTR build, we are testing the new ability to mail account-bound items to other characters on your account that may be on different servers. Notably, this should allow you to move heirlooms between servers, in advance of our planned Warlords changes that will make them fully account-wide.<br />
<br />
Sending this sort of mail should work like any cross-server communication: You send the item to &quot;Playername-Servername&quot; and it should otherwise work like regular mail. Note that you can only send account-bound items, and not other items or gold.<br />
<br />
Example: I have a character, Thrall, on the Benedictus server. I want to send my heirloom mace to my alt, Durotan, on the Lycanthoth server. I'd log in as Thrall, and attach the mace to a mail addressed to &quot;Durotan-Lycanthoth&quot; and hit send.<br />
<br />
We'd appreciate any feedback or bug reports on this new feature so that we can address any issues prior to the release of 5.4.2. But even without direct feedback, just logging into PTR and mailing account-bound items across servers should give us useful data to help confirm that the feature is working as intended. Thanks!<br />

quality of life changes? whose life, ours, or the devs?<br />
<br />
why take gems, and reforging away? is it for our benefit? it isn't for my benefit as a healer.<br />
is the new &quot;grind&quot; going to be chasing the gear you really want/need in a timeless isle format? or, are the characters going to be even more simplistic, that it won't even matter. we already lost control of our mana pools, what's next. everyone will have the same mana regen? <br />
<br />
It's a difficult conversation to come to any consensus on because different people always find different things fun. It's all rather subjective. I don't recommend anyone try to convince anyone else that they're wrong in what they understand to be fun for them. That's a waste of precious bodily fluids. However, our goal has always been and I believe always will be to create a fun and engaging game that is free from tediousness and complexities for the sake of tediousness and complexities. Easy to learn, difficult to master is our motto.<br />
<br />
Depth and complexity of systems don't need to come from the number of buttons to click, innumerable steps to take to complete mundane tasks, or obscurity of how to go about them. Certainly decrypting game systems can be fun sometimes, but as a company we embrace a style of game that is very approachable with systems that are simple to understand on the surface but that hold a lot of genuine gameplay depth. That was true the day World of Warcraft was released, and we strive to ensure that remains true even with the addition of dozens of new systems over the years. As time marches on and we implement our latest and greatest ideas, they don't always keep pace with that design intent, and sometimes we have to make difficult decisions.<br />
<br />
You will also find that one button that does it all......isn't so fun either.<br />
Tooooootally agree, which is kind of what hit/expertise caps were. You either hit them or you didn't. Binary on/off buttons aren't so fun - depends how shiny the button is though I suppose.<br />
<br />
You imply other systems in the game suffer from the same; to which are you referring?<br />
<br />
So, you're gonna stack strength just to be different from other elemental next to you?<br />
Kind of the interesting crux of a lot of these conversations is illusion of customization vs. actual customization vs. efficiency, and how all of those interplay.<br />
<br />
If someone liked spending all of their talent points in the old system in strange ways and ended up being extremely sub-optimal, but felt better about their individuality and choices and therefore found that system more &quot;fun&quot;, were they wrong? What should the efficiency gap be, and how should we as designers and game creators ensure looking up a guide vs. not looking up a guide isn't the difference between a playable game and an impossible one? If that player who enjoyed their custom build and choices saw they performed far below everyone else would they understand it was due to their choices, or would they feel like the game was being unfair to them?<br />
<br />
All interesting topics.<br />
<br />
why not? this game's revenues are in excess of over $1 billion dollars a year. it's not like Fred, and Ethel are busy in the backroom coding, and we can't work them too hard.<br />
Software development is not an assembly line. Adding a another eyeball to a doll you manufacture (because ... you're insane, I guess?) and adding another person to an assembly line to install that eye isn't how a collaborative effort like software - and especially game creation which includes a lot of art and &quot;feeling&quot; - is created. Some of the reasons are encapsulated in Brooks's Law.<br />
<br />
Anyway to address your &quot;why not?&quot; more directly, the difficulty in balance is really that we want classes and choices to feel meaningful and unique. When you play your warlock you want to feel like a warlock, and not like a slightly different mage. And so it's just a fact that uniqueness and equality are two opposing concepts (no, you're not a unique snowflake AND as good as anyone else at everything), and in that we have to find some middle ground we call balance. But you're asking why talents can't be truly balanced if there's choice, so let's draw on a piece of paper a grid 3x3 and in each we'll put a unique number 1-through-9. I'll pick 4 of those numbers, 6, 7, 8, 9, add those up, that's 30, and then you being the same class pick your own 4 numbers from the same grid and you choose 1, 2, 3, 4, that's 10. Those numbers aren't equal, and almost all combinations will not be equal. Obviously a very simple if not flawed analogy, but balanced and fun vs. unique and meaningful isn't a problem to be solved by adding more calculators to the pile because it isn't just about spreadsheet math.<br />
<br />
But this is all waaaaaaay too off-topic. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/280977-quality-of-whose-life/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10586899089?page=17#326))<br />

You can find a topic about the anniversary rewards from other games on our forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1400072-So-at-least-you-got-the-Anniversary-year-right)!<br />
World of Warcraft turns nine on November 23, 2013! Another epic year has flown by, and we’d like to thank you all for joining us on so many great adventures. To celebrate, players who log into the game between the dates of November, 18 through December, 1 will receive a feat of strength added to their Achievements and a “Celebration Package” item. Using your item will kick off the celebrations by shooting off fireworks*, applying a (visual only) tabard to your character, and granting an 9% bonus to experience and reputation gains from any enemies defeated while active.<br />
<br />
We look forward to another year of adventures ahead and many more to come!<br />
<br />
*Use fireworks responsibly. Harmful or fatal if swallowed. If fireworks get in eyes, rinse in muddy pond water for 20 minutes, /dance, and contact your nearest Mistweaver, Priest, Shaman, Druid, or Paladin. <br />

<br />
Environment Art<br />
Using your creativity and ability to work within the World of Warcraft art style, create a small environment diorama that would fit well in the game world. Your quest: Concept, model, and texture an environment piece that you could imagine stumbling upon during your travels across Kalimdor, the Eastern Kingdoms, Outland, Northrend, or Pandaria.<br />
<br />
Required elements are trees, rocks, grass, and props, plus a small structure (such as a shrine).<br />
<br />
Character Art<br />
Using your creativity and ability to work within the World of Warcraft art style, concept, model, and texture a non-player character (NPC) or creature that you could imagine roaming the plains of Durotar, exploring the depths of Deepholm, or just sitting in the Pig and Whistle Tavern knocking back a mug o’ Thistle Tea.<br />
<br />
Required elements are the character or creature, along with some sort of clothing or armor. Feel free to go further by adding weapons or other accessories.<br />
<br />
Weapon Art<br />
Using your creativity and ability to work within the World of Warcraft art style, concept, model, and texture a main hand weapon with a complimentary offhand weapon/shield/item. It could be the pairing of the “Deadly sword of Castle AHHHH” and a “Jabberwock Scale Shield,” the “Repentant Crusader Mace” and a “Tome of Righteousness,” or even the “Beguilers Ebonwood Staff” and an “Obfuscating Eye of Yogg-saron.” Let Azeroth be your guide and pull from the many established cultures, encounters, and legends that exist in World of Warcraft.<br />
<br />
Required elements are the main hand weapon, along with its matching offhand item, but feel free to go further by adding a player or creature wielding your creations.<br />
<br />
Animation<br />
Keeping in mind and working within the World of Warcraft art style, select a class from the game and create either a battle scene or flavor animation. A battle scene could be any type of combat situation. Think of it as a pitch for a new player class. Your scene could be as epic as a final boss fight, or something more comical like warding off a group of feisty Murlocs. The flavor animation piece is all about personality. It could be a group of characters having a good time hoisting back pints of ale or coming home after winning a PVP match. Feel free to interpret these how you wish. Be as creative as possible, but don’t forget to watch your weight, timing, strong poses, and arcs!<br />
<br />
Required elements include one cycled animation in a stand or combat ready pose. Make sure animations return to the same start position and feel free to add additional models or weapons.<br />
<br />
The final piece should be animated in 30 frames per second and in meters. Please avoid camera shakes and blurs as they tend to hide fundamentals that we look for.<br />
<br />

Agreed. If you weren't donating 100% to them already, don't even worry about where half of it goes. Take your mount and pet and feel good knowing some of it went somewhere useful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The point of this is for some of the money Blizzard could have earned to go to charity. They're not giving you a consolation prize for donating 100% of the proceeds to a company they're not a part of.

<br />
Look, they should be giving us these mounts IN GAME or be like other mmo's and give us the option of obtaining it in game while also selling it in the store. They use the money we give them for the base game, the expansions and the subscription to pay their employees to make these mounts. Back in the old days when they were a stand up company they would put the mounts and pets those employees made using our money into the game for us to obtain somehow. <br />
<br />
So expecting them to give 100% of the funds(of which they used to not even make before they got greedy), to a charity is not a weird concept.

At least some of it goes to charity.<br />
<br />
And you are aware that Blizzard has said, for the last 3 years, we won't see another special Anniversary item til 10. The first was testing achievements out to deliver rewards through (we were in Patch 3.0 but Wrath was still months out, so no metas could be tested large-scale), the second was the 5 Year, a major anniversary that also co-incided with the re-launch of Onyxia's Lair.<br />

<br />
Except they're a company first, and they've been using this model for years now, so it is kind of a weird concept when speaking of this particular company. How you didn't get this in the first place I've no idea. Their model isn't like the old one, so why even bring it up? <br />
<br />
By the way, that &quot;asinine and embarrassing&quot; comment I made was a highlight of the continuous cycle of puerility that you'd just be putting yourself through by even complaining about it on this site like some high and mighty Do-Nothing-Facebook-Charity-Liker.

<br />
It will still act as a ground mount, and if you leave Draenor it is still usable ~:|. Stop calling it a 'nerf' when it is not a nerf. Now what is important is them adding a Fel Corgi model into the game that I can buy and hopefully give some to charity.</div></div><hr />

Now look at this you people who argue about if the split should be 50/50 or 100/0 or whatever. People who actually need the money appreciate it. All of you who scream that they should just give X% of the money have your own set of problems of course but most likely live a fairly decent life. You people should just shut up and buy the pet and/or the mount if you like them and feel proud that you at least gave some money to charity. If you are one of those twats that think 100% of money should go to charity and you should get something from it from some other company you should stop being so entitled little bitch and just give the money to charity in first place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They sure are &quot;nice&quot;. The 50% is there for a reason. 50% profit and 50% donation. The donations are taken in from you and sent out by Blizzard. So, Blizzard receives 100% of the write-off which means they get to make 100% of that amount of money tax free. Whoops, don't forget they will be taking all the costs of doing business out of that 50% profit, so in actuality they will be getting to write down profits from other areas of business. This brings down their effective tax rate which reduces the amount of money for all the social causes that people get all riled up about on these forums. You don't need to steal from people when dummies will just throw it at you. Although I would rather see a national sales tax replace the current tax code instead of a flat tax, I would settle for either one because at least either of them would protect me from people like you.</div></div><hr />

They are encouraging people to donate this way but I agree they could give more themselves. This charity is also advertisement for them and I doubt they even lose money on this (they probably sell twice as many pets). They also make a ridiculous profit on these pets and mounts even if they only get 50% of the money.</div></div><hr />

Fun to see people criticizing the &quot;batman for a day&quot; when this may be one of the less costly actions they did.<br />
<br />
&quot;Batman for a day&quot; was just lots of unpaid volunteers who managed to persuade lots of other people into setting up a crazy day for someone, this is not where donations go.<br />
<br />
And yes, lots of other people need help too, that's not really news. You can believe if you want that sending money to the Philippines is more important than trying to make the lives of children with life threatening medical conditions better, but you really can't compare the two using this example alone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I was born with congenital heart failure, of a severity that the doctors told my parents I may not make it past the age of five. But, I did. When I was five however, I contracted Kawasaki disease, and keep in mind at the time this was a disease (now known as Kawasaki Syndrome) that was very rare in the United States and was common in people of Japanese descent, but, I wasn't. I was misdiagnosed by the hospital, they told my parents I had a bug bite. Kawasaki Disease if not treated right away can cause serious damage to your heart, and it worsened my heart condition. Kawasaki Disease isn't something you can really test for, but, it is known how to treat it. It takes an IVIG protein drip that can take over 1,000 to 10,000 blood donors depending on the type of dosage, upper numbers are common. Sometimes you need two or three doses. <br />
<br />
I survived, and I had to travel to San Francisco just about every weekend. I hated taking trains. I've always had a bad experience with trains. I didn't like going to the University of California Los Angeles, nor did I even like the University of California San Francisco, even though I was sick. I used to refuse to eat the food because they'd lace it with crushed medications and go on gummy bear diets. Anyways, I had my first open heart surgery in San Francisco (it wasn't my first major surgery), but it was the biggest of my life at that point. <br />
<br />
Shortly after my surgery a doctor from San Francisco area (who was on residency at Stanford) ended up relocating to a place called Valley Children's Hospital in Fresno/Madera area. The hospital had always been great with children, and it was great to have a surgeon that lived close to us. Fresno/Madera was about an hour to an hour and a half away depending on traffic, it was much more feasible to travel by car than by train. Before this event happened, Make-A-Wish Foundation had approached me about a wish. I wished to fly to San Francisco instead of trains, because I really did not like traveling by train. With this new surgeon in the area and a cardiologist there, I didn't have to take trains anymore. So, it nulled the Wish. Make-A-Wish came to my home a second time and offered to let me fly anywhere, to do anything I'd like. They suggested things like Disney World, traveling some place I always wanted to go. Told me to think of anything I could want.<br />

I thought about it and gave them an answer... I thought about asking if it's possible to go to Alaska, I've always been fascinated by Alaska. In the end, I asked to talk to my President, to have lunch with him. It took a while, about a year to make the arrangements. Make-A-Wish pulled it off. They flew me out of Fresno Yosemite International Airport to Washington, D.C. It took a while to get there, due to there being bad weather in Dallas so we had to switch some flights. Nonetheless, it was my first time on a plane. I loved it. Make-A-Wish took me to the airport in a limo. On the planes they let me board first, I got to meet the Pilots. A pilot gave me and my brother both a hat and let us in the cockpit while on the ground and while flying. They even let us press a few buttons (they told us which ones to press). <br />
<br />
In Washington, D.C. I stayed at the Marriott, the one within walking distance of the White House. I remember being so fascinated by how big the lights are, how tall the ceilings are. I grew up in a place where wealth wasn't flaunted. Where streets weren't always safe. While in the capital of my country I was taken on a tour by tour guide companies and the Secret Service. They gave me and my brother both pins of the Secret Service, those gold ones they wear on their suits. They were very kind to us, let us explore. They took us out to eat at Planet Hollywood, they took us to the Treasury, to even the national monuments except for the Washington Monument (as it was closed for maintenance). They kept me busy, my energy was drained, yes. It was mainly because I was so excited and had to explore every little thing in our capital. I was fascinated with the trees, pink leafs, who knew that was possible? Trees were of all different colors. There was so much green, so much life. <br />
<br />
I was truly happy in Washington, DC. I didn't once thing about my heart. On Easter Day, I was taken to the White House with my family and we were given a tour. We got to see the Oval Office, we got to sit in the President's chair. The staircase the President comes down to give an address to the nation on Easter Sunday, we got to stand behind it with the VIPs, separated from the crowd. Right after his speech we were taken inside the White House and I got to spend an hour with President Clinton and the First Lady, Hillary Clinton. My brother asked to see the dog, and Hillary requested Buddy be brought up to us.<br />
<br />
Though, we were exhausted from the tour. My brother did try to run up the private staircase and found himself surrounded by security. It was a surreal experience to talk to the President of the United States. I was only eight years old. This is the main I learned from television and school that is the most powerful person in the world. This is the man that led our nation. I asked to see him, Make-A-Wish made it happen. Granted my wish to meet the President of the United States while he was a sitting President, despite the Kosovo War going on. <br />
<br />
Make-A-Wish didn't cut me off after meeting the President. They kept in contact, invited me to holiday parties, to events, to air shows... The Blue Angels even performed for us Make-A-Wish Kids. At one of the parties they gave me a gift, Warcraft III. This sparked my fascination in World of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
People argue it's a waste to give a dying kid a wish. It's not a waste of money. I survived. This gave me hope. This inspired me. Living this dream in Washington, D.C. and meeting a person I called a hero and respected so much gave me life. So yes, the mission (http://wish.org/about-us/our-story/our-mission) is true. A wish is a game changer. It changed my life. It inspired me, enriched my life. It showed me a world greater than I was, and showed me I have a spot in this vast and great world. I survived, where many of my Wish peers may have not, but, a lot of us do survive. Make-A-Wish helps us fight, gives us strength. <br />
<br />
So yes, when I have a spare $10 I will buy this pet. Why? Make-A-Wish gave me hope. This adds up, the donations add up and can cause great wishes. Look at what was recently done in San Francisco, they turned it into Gotham for Miles. Make-A-Wish Foundation is amazing, and I thank you Blizzard for doing it. So, thank you in advance. <br />

My condition is still having it's ups and downs, my chances and outlook is better today, much better. A ton of medication + pain + random strokes. But, it's all worth it. I like living.</div></div><hr />

How you didn't get this in the first place I've no idea. Their model isn't like the old one, so why even bring it up? <br />
<br />
By the way, that &quot;asinine and embarrassing&quot; comment I made was a highlight of the continuous cycle of puerility that you'd just be putting yourself through by even complaining about it on this site like some high and mighty Do-Nothing-Facebook-Charity-Liker. You could have simply given your money to charity and shut your mouth.<br />
<br />
And plenty of people have been bitching about this model for years, ever since the sparkle pony. Time doesn't make it any better. Shut my mouth? Cute, if you take a look around, this is a discussion forum. But you have fun telling everyone with a different opinion to shut up, and calling them twats. Stay classy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now look at this you people who argue about if the split should be 50/50 or 100/0 or whatever. People who actually need the money appreciate it. All of you who scream that they should just give X% of the money have your own set of problems of course but most likely live a fairly decent life. You people should just shut up and buy the pet and/or the mount if you like them and feel proud that you at least gave some money to charity. If you are one of those twats that think 100% of money should go to charity and you should get something from it from some other company you should stop being so entitled little bitch and just give the money to charity in first place.<br />
<br />
Oh look, another one with horrible reading comprehension who likes to flame using the word twat. You guys are so trendy, it's adorable! What part of I don't like that they're profiting off charity with a mount they made from our sub and expansion money do you not understand? What part of I am donating 100% of the money directly to the charity are you not comprehending? I typed all of that out really really slow hoping maybe it would make you read it slow but somehow I don't think it works that way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is exactly what Make-A-Wish is about. Hope/dreams is what lots of people need to survive, especially children, and sometimes that's even more important than an appropriate treatment. Some wishes may seem quite &quot;crazy&quot;, but most of the time there really isn't a lot of money involved in it, while it gives a lot not only to one kid, but also to his family/friends/close people. And yes, it also saves lives, but in a way much harder to evaluate than most charity.<br />
<br />
Once again, you can't really compare Make-A-Wish with the Philippines current needs. These are two very different people in need of very different things, and with very different ways to obtain them.<br />
<br />
Also, I agree with Cerberussian and many others, criticizing Blizzard for not making it 100% donation is just... plain stupid and greedy, since it infers that you'd want to make a &quot;donation&quot; only if you got something in return (which is kind of... not what a donation is ?) while Blizzard gets nothing. Kind of the same as people criticizing humble bundles (https://www.humblebundle.com/) sometimes for not being &quot;worth $1&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Why does it matter? Blizzard isn't the only company to do this. Do you whine about when other companies only do partial donations to charity from proceeds of sales or just when big bad evil meanie Blizzard does it? Get a grip. If you want to donate more to Make A Wish you are completely free to do so and no one is stopping you. Seriously don't even try to turn this into the usual hater circle jerk nonsense. It would be truly disgusting.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Of course after December 31 the Make-A-Wish foundation will no longer need donations. Seriously Blizzard, why put a clock on a charity pet?<br />
<br />
Again do you take issue when other companies do the exact same thing or is it only bad when Blizzard does it? Again if you feel the charity deserves more donations you are more than welcome to donate any amount of your choosing.<br />

Hopefully with the nerf to flying coming up they will also nerf the cost of these flying mounts. At least it'll be usable for awhile before WoD, but I'm not interested in paying $25 for a mount that I can't use for it's primary function in most of the areas I'll be in.<br />
<br />
Oh jesus christ. I know this is difficult to comprehend but there are more zones in Wow than just what will be available in Wod. They aren't removing flying entirely.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, clearly they broke the bank by spending half a day adding a single vanity pet.<br />
<br />
Companies exist to make a profit not to spend all their time and resources giving away freebies.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Only way I'll buy the dragon is if 100% of the proceeds go to charity. I despise them charging extra for mounts and pets on top of expansions and subscriptions and don't want their little greedy paws on the money. If 1% of the money goes to them and not the charity I'll just donate the money to charity and use one of the mounts I earned in game.<br />
<br />
If you don't like how Blizzard does business, stop giving them money entirely. You do realize it is quite likely some proceeds from Wow subscriptions have gone towards developing items for the Blizzard store right?<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, so Blizzard couldn't give a pet or a mount for 9th Anniversary, but then they immediately release them for Blizz Store. <br />
At least some of it goes to charity.<br />
<br />
Wow has had 9 anniversaries and only 2 out of NINE years and I repeat NINE years gave away pets and those were for two very specific reasons one being the introduction of the achievement system and the other for the 5th anniversary and revamp of the Ony raid for level 80. They have told us for the past THREE years that we won't be getting a pet every year.<br />
<br />
Let. It. Go.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Look, they should be giving us these mounts IN GAME or be like other mmo's and give us the option of obtaining it in game while also selling it in the store. They use the money we give them for the base game, the expansions and the subscription to pay their employees to make these mounts. Back in the old days when they were a stand up company they would put the mounts and pets those employees made using our money into the game for us to obtain somehow. <br />
<br />
So expecting them to give 100% of the funds(of which they used to not even make before they got greedy), to a charity is not a weird concept. Also, just a little tip, if you're going to call someone a twat you should take the time to read what said twat posted before you make an asinine comment and embarrass yourself. I already said if it's not 100% I'll be just giving the charity the money directly. Why should Blizzard get half of the charity money making something our subs and expansion money has ALREADY PAID FOR?<br />
<br />
Again put up or shut up. If you don't like how they do business then stop giving them money. Just because you refuse to buy mounts and pets doesn't mean your money hasn't gone towards them.<br />

If you care so much more about charity, why not just selflessly donate the full amount directly to a charity?<br />
<br />
If you're only going to donate to charity because you're getting something in return, you're already on the wrong side of the argument.<br />
<br />
Because the people bitching about it could care less about the actual dying children and don't have an issue using them to push their anti-Blizzard agenda and yet somehow Blizzard is the evil one here.<br />

They sure are &quot;nice&quot;. The 50% is there for a reason. 50% profit and 50% donation. The donations are taken in from you and sent out by Blizzard. So, Blizzard receives 100% of the write-off which means they get to make 100% of that amount of money tax free. Whoops, don't forget they will be taking all the costs of doing business out of that 50% profit, so in actuality they will be getting to write down profits from other areas of business. This brings down their effective tax rate which reduces the amount of money for all the social causes that people get all riled up about on these forums. You don't need to steal from people when dummies will just throw it at you. Although I would rather see a national sales tax replace the current tax code instead of a flat tax, I would settle for either one because at least either of them would protect me from people like you.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard also has an employee donation matching program which results in some quite significant contributions to various charities which aren't advertised at all because they aren't doing it to look good. Give it a fucking rest already.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
They are encouraging people to donate this way but I agree they could give more themselves. This charity is also advertisement for them and I doubt they even lose money on this (they probably sell twice as many pets). They also make a ridiculous profit on these pets and mounts even if they only get 50% of the money.<br />
<br />
Quite honestly it is none of your god damn business what Blizzard does with their own money. Why don't you worry about your own money and how its spent?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why take gems, and reforging away?<br />
<br />
<br />
Certainly decrypting game systems can be fun sometimes, but as a company we embrace a style of game that is very approachable with systems that are simple to understand on the surface but that hold a lot of genuine gameplay depth. That was true the day World of Warcraft was released, and we strive to ensure that remains true even with the addition of dozens of new systems over the years.<br />
<br />
Vanilla WoW, TBC, and WoTLK corresponded to about pure addition, to being &quot;expansion packs&quot; and not &quot;deletion packs&quot; in almost every way.<br />
<br />
However, Cataclysm, MoP, and soon especially WoD correspond to a lot removed as well as added.<br />
<br />
Am I talking about fullness of the game world like character customization or about Blizzard's subscriber count?<br />
<br />
Both, for they followed the same pattern.<br />
<br />
Getting only heavily mixed feelings about new expansions, wondering what unannounced-yet prior spells or prior customization will be deleted next, is not a positive.<br />
<br />
Diablo 3 was simplified from the preceding title in the series, while having exceptionally widespread and officially non-bannable real-money purchase of character progression (items in its case instead of levels in WoW WoD's case), and the result was as critics of that philosophy predicted: less sustained long-term playtime after the initial weeks. (I'm into WoW, not Diablo, but it was illustrative how the same pattern got followed).<br />
<br />
WoW and Blizzard's history do quite teach lessons: But they aren't ones in favor of assuming deleting gem customization is going to add a multi-year player without low attention span for every one lost from it (and from where other applications of this post-TBC/WoTLK deletionist philosophy lead).<br />
<br />
People don't play for X hundred hours, then go &quot;I'm quitting because I felt obligated to spend a minute deciding which gem I desired before continuing.&quot;<br />
<br />
They quit because &quot;I'm bored, and, if I played many hours more, I'd still be bored&quot; (which happens extra often when there is repetitiveness enforced by simplification).<br />
<br />
Provided the choice wasn't removed, unlike the deletion planned for WoD, I wouldn't mind if the game had text essentially equivalent to &quot;if you only care about DPS maximization for PvE instances at all times, your spec should chose this gem, so we gifted one to you for free and auto-socketed it unless you chose otherwise.&quot;<br />
<br />
For example, if I want to have one gear set gemmed extra for haste, because I sometimes find it fun, that should be my right, my choice. If it lowers DPS and if I care, I'd know so in a moment from one of my mods or otherwise but don't need to have the option to ever do so removed for the sake of hyper-prioritizing retard-friendliness (the hypothetical individual unintentionally &quot;crippled&quot; rather than making a deliberate choice) over all else and everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Considering you can get far more feedback, much faster, from places like Deviantart, this doesn't seem very grand prizey...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course it's less 'for the charity' even for Blizzard and more for the tax write off and good PR. No business or businessman would 'donate' nearly as much as they did if it weren't for that tax write off.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted to say thank you for sharing your story. That is really wonderful. I would be pming this to you but 10 post required for that. I wanted you to know that your story was not falling on deaf ears.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Anaeska</div><div class="date">2013-11-21, 08:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hi there! Talked to Chaud and decided to share the rest of the story. :)<br />
<br />
People argue it's a waste to give a dying kid a wish. It's not a waste of money. I survived. This gave me hope. This inspired me. Living this dream in Washington, D.C. and meeting a person I called a hero and respected so much gave me life. So yes, the mission (http://wish.org/about-us/our-story/our-mission) is true. A wish is a game changer. It changed my life. It inspired me, enriched my life. It showed me a world greater than I was, and showed me I have a spot in this vast and great world. I survived, where many of my Wish peers may have not, but, a lot of us do survive. Make-A-Wish helps us fight, gives us strength. <br />
<br />
So yes, when I have a spare $10 I will buy this pet. Why? Make-A-Wish gave me hope. This adds up, the donations add up and can cause great wishes. Look at what was recently done in San Francisco, they turned it into Gotham for Miles. Make-A-Wish Foundation is amazing, and I thank you Blizzard for doing it. So, thank you in advance. <br />

My condition is still having it's ups and downs, my chances and outlook is better today, much better. A ton of medication + pain + random strokes. But, it's all worth it. I like living.<br />
<br />
A feel good and moving story.</div></div><hr />
