Then you can spare your agony by not playing it. For what I’ve been playing in the alpha there isn’t much change from Legion. But I know I’ll still enjoy the game.</div></div><hr />

Yup, that is exactly what happens. Although admittedly they hotfix some of the most glaring shit (that was talked about by players ad nauseum in the beta thread) within the first 4 months, then the rest remains broken...ad infinitum.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
• CancelUnitBuff - no longer supports canceling by spell name.<br />
• UnitBuff - dropped second parameter (nameSubtext). Also, no longer supports querying by spell name.<br />
• UnitDebuff - dropped second parameter (nameSubtext). Also, no longer supports querying by spell name.<br />
• UnitAura - dropped second parameter (nameSubtext). Also, no longer supports querying by spell name.<br />
<br />
Oh boy, these are going to break a loooot of things. Tons of macros, weakauras and addons use the spell name with these.<br />
<br />
<br />
World Map Changes<br />
The World Map has been almost entirely re-written, and all map API was removed. It’s being replaced but we are currently still transitioning. worldMapAreaID, dungeonMapID, dungeonFloor have all been removed and replaced with just uiMapID.<br />
<br />
Oh god, the end is here. RIP all map addons, all addons that use world locations at all, and probably all addons that even think about the world map. Hopefully they figure out the API before too late so that at least the active addons have a chance to update before pre-patch launch.</div></div><hr />

Correlation =/= causation. You're drawing conclusions where none exist. The Casters have already been proven to have nothing to do with any sort of release. Their channel lasts the absolute longest that a channel can last in the game, which happens to be 7 days.</div></div><hr />

Go to the official forums and bitch about it. I can't guarantee you it will work (especially if a whole bunch of people decide to do the same thing), but I know it has worked for some people in the past. <br />
<br />
Devs seem to be paying less attention to the forums with Ghostcrawler gone though so not sure if it will be as effective now.<br />

Seems to. I just checked my launcher - the old Alpha option has turned INTO the new Beta option. No uninstalling or reinstalling involved. <br />
It allowed me to load into the character creation screen on the Beta servers, so it does seem Alpha access = Beta access.<br />
<br />
Huzzah.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alpha starts -&gt; Datamined stuff/comments from alpha -&gt; People who warn that stuff is broken -&gt; People who say &quot;it's just alpha&quot; -&gt; Beta starts -&gt; Datamined stuff/comments from Beta (same as before) -&gt; People who warn that stuff is broken -&gt; People who say &quot;it's just beta&quot; -&gt; Expansion Launches, Your stuff is broken in Live, man -&gt; People who say &quot;we tried to warn you&quot; -&gt; People who say &quot;it's just launch, they'll fix it&quot; -&gt; 14 months go by -&gt; Your stuff still broken, whaaat? -&gt; Next Expansion announced -&gt; Work seems to cease on current expansion, Content Drought begins -&gt; Alpha starts<br />
<br />
There is difference between &quot;broken&quot; and &quot;have bugs&quot;. I had great Legion experience, launch was smoothest in WoW history, same with patches (with noticable exception of 7.3.5). Also I enjoyed whole content, besides lack of Broken Shore story campaign it was pretty flawless to me. <br />
<br />
And what content drought? Antorus will have only 7 months when pre-patch will hit and last content update was in March (when they added new battleground). And even without that I'm bussy until last day with Mage Tower on my alts, I won't have time to level my Allied Races until post-launch time of BfA.<br />
<br />
While I'm doing all these and enjoying myself, on this forum SAME PEOPLE are bitching constantly about every.single.change.and.addition. Of course I don't like all stuff and changes, but I like most of them - otherwise I would simply quit and leave feedback directly to Blizz. From your post we can assume that game is constantly broken at least few years. So why the hell are you playing / discussing about broken game? It's very, very stupid thing to do.<br />
<br />
That's why my only explanation is that people like you are either addicted or masochist. Very sad, either way. That's why I usually avoid &quot;discussion&quot; with whiners. Feel free to ignore this post.</div></div><hr />

You can copy your WoW live client and restart app, it will download only new stuff. I use this trick with every Beta/PTR, always works.</div></div><hr />

Makes sure you restart your launcher when you check. I didn't see that I had access before I did.<br />

Oh, I don't disagree. If they can just make world coordinates consistent and get rid of the global current map/zone stuff it will probably be worth it.<br />

Seeing as the alliance only has the middle and bottom part of EK. Is the alliance getting Gilneas as playable city? It would make sense story, strategic etc wise. <br />
It is a nice place for all the North EK stuff to be handled from. Seeing that arathi highlands is a Warzone . So army's passing thru that would be very dangerous. But sailing towards a save haven like Gilneas to keep control of everything except Silvermoon is smart.<br />

I can already predict Blizzard is going to stick to the GCD change through hell and high water, and the most we will get, if that, is some kind of compromise where cooldowns are either on a separate GCD or the GCDs for them are tiny.<br />

<br />
You can copy your current WOW into a folder then install BFA into that folder. Saves downloading the full game again.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, same with me. I checked around 3:00PM EST when I first saw that BfA had gone Beta and nothing, just checked again about a half hour ago and there it was. Downloading all 51GB now. They must be sending them out in waves to avoid killing the download servers...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Can't play the game if you're always complaining, because that's what those players do.<br />
<br />
He's probably a salty vanilla baby, they seem to trash everything related to wow expansions because blizzard is ignoring their questions surrounding vanilla servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
For the better, I might add. I am so glad that my Orc will no longer feel rigid and weird when firing a weapon come BfA!<br />

I got beta access for MoP and Warlords even though I wasn't playing for month (account was still active).<br />
<br />
Seems it's very random with having an active account as the only criteria.</div></div><hr />

So, if you had alpha access, are you then still in the beta? Can't check atm :)</div></div><hr />

If you can download it in your Battle.net app, you have access. :)<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splatomat</div><div class="date">2018-04-25, 03:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's why my only explanation is that people like you are either addicted or masochist. Very sad, either way. That's why I usually avoid &quot;discussion&quot; with whiners. Feel free to ignore this post.<br />
<br />
I think you might have missed the point of my post.  I'll try to explain more directly. The point I was making is that when people raise serious issues in Alpha/Beta/Launch, and just get pissed on and dismissed as &quot;salty whiners&quot;, that's a Bad Thing. Here's why:<br />
<br />
There are real problems (there always are), and the only way to get them to change is to highlight them and talk about them - repeatedly, if necessary (it will be). <br />
<br />
Pooping on complainers doesn't create a better product for you. It creates a worse one. <br />
<br />
I can both complain about a product and use it; I can acknowledge that some things are good, some things are okay, and some things need serious attention. It's not some binary state of me casting it aside entirely OR being a slave to it. That's simplistic and inaccurate.<br />
<br />
I'm neither addicted nor a masochist. I want BFA to be the best product it can be, the same way I've wanted every expansion to be the best product it could be. I want the product I have already paid for to be superior, not sub-par. Maybe you're okay with what I consider &quot;sub-par&quot;. I'm not. <br />
<br />
Hope this helps you understand a bit better. :)</div></div><hr />

You're talking about it in a reasonable manner. A lot of players complaining about this, that, or the other, are saying idiotic things like &quot;Blizzard hates its players...&quot; &quot;This is the thing that will kill WoW...&quot; and all sorts of other nonsense.<br />
<br />
If you try to engage with that type of vitriol, well, you get called a fanboi or worse. If people offered consistently reasonable criticism, I bet EVERYONE would take that criticism more seriously.</div></div><hr />

Yup i said faster, not 100% sure.<br />

Well if the poll on the front page is any indication, this seems like a very open beta. If it is, there will likely be another invite wave.</div></div><hr />
