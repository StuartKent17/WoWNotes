Garona has a 100% boost, ie. she counters an entire extra ability, thats far stronger than any other bonus, including Blook or the new guy.<br />

I don't see the point of using them on my main. I have a nice spread of skills/traits and don't' want to take the chance on messing them up. So not sure why you'd save them anyway heh.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't there 2 pvp seasons during SoO? I mean I don't think this is the last patch either, but I don't think this is necessarilly the smoking gun for 6.3, they /could/ just be forward planning. I can't really see them doing another SoO though, I think that would kill the game at this point.<br />

nice star wars trailer!<br />

<br />
When you will kill Archimonde, there is endgame cinematic. The same like with Arthas, Deathwing, Garrosh.<br />
When Blizzard in a history of the game did cinematic in a middle of the expansion? Never.<br />
<br />
But yes, there could be &quot;Ruby Sanctum&quot; mini raid in 6.3, but I dont think so. 6.3 will be just small zone (maybe Farahlon) as a Lore Gate Patch to the next expansion.<br />
<br />
Or 6.3 is another 5.5 patch. (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/357545921338281985)</div></div><hr />

The level gate for new or returning players on different accounts is a pain. So many friends have just quit after level 30-50 because by that time they want to be playing with there friends/me at max level.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2015-06-16, 03:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">E3 is pretty off the chart this year. The Bethseda one was pretty amazing - Doom isn't a game I'm into, but it looks awesome - and Fallout 4, if it works as advertised, is a game I'm going to spend a LOT of time in. <br />
<br />
In fact, if they added multiplayer, dungeons, and raids? They'd be exactly what I want from WoW. There's a TON of replay factor in what they're doing - crafting, custom gear and housing, circuitry! And throwing the PipBoy onto a mobile phone or tablet? That's frigging spectacular. Imagine putting your raid bars on your tablet, on your desk, and freeing up the UI. And it's interactive and linked to the game? If it works as intended, that's a homerun.<br />
<br />
Bethesda is doing everything Blizzard should be. They even threw in a crack about Blizzard's booth being closer to the porn back in the day. Looking at the games that are coming out, and the ones out recently, Blizzard's stuff is starting too look really dated, lacking creativity, and stale. Bethseda set the bar higher by bringing the game out into the tablet/phone space, and all the possibilities there - and what do we get from Blizzard? Twitter. And selfies. <br />
<br />
They even threw a free game at everyone, which I downloaded and started playing with, and it's really, really cool. Here we have Bethseda giving away stuff, and getting everything right, and what do we get from Blizzard? 7 months of nothing, store mounts, bullshit Q&amp;As, and garrisons.<br />
<br />
I guess we just can't look to Blizzard for cool stuff anymore.</div></div><hr />

The Bethseda one was pretty amazing - Doom isn't a game I'm into, but it looks awesome - and Fallout 4, if it works as advertised, is a game I'm going to spend a LOT of time in. <br />
<br />
In fact, if they added multiplayer, dungeons, and raids? They'd be exactly what I want from WoW. There's a TON of replay factor in what they're doing - crafting, custom gear and housing, circuitry! And throwing the PipBoy onto a mobile phone or tablet? That's frigging spectacular. Imagine putting your raid bars on your tablet, on your desk, and freeing up the UI. And it's interactive and linked to the game? If it works as intended, that's a homerun.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Comparing a next gen single player game to a 10 year old MMO is always fair. Also, sticking your raid bars on your tablet would be dumb. How would taking your eyes AWAY from the screen to look at your desk be helpful? Eyes on the game while you're raiding. <br />
<br />
<br />
When you will kill Archimonde, there is endgame cinematic. The same like with Arthas, Deathwing, Garrosh.<br />
When Blizzard in a history of the game did cinematic in a middle of the expansion? Never.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wrath Gate. At the end of every quest zone in WoD aside from Spires.</div></div><hr />

if you remember there was a cinematic in this expansion when you finish the quest to kill Garrosh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So: three seasons, that mean THREE raid tiers, that mean THREE patches, that mean Archimonde IS NOT the final boss; 6.2 IS NOT the final patch. Thanks, you're welcome.<br />
Sounds awful. I can't imagine being forced to slog through another year+ of Garrisoncraft. Glad I quit a few months back.</div></div><hr />

Extra salt in your corn flakes this morning? The fact its been out a long time probably means that they already know what type of gameplay to expect and are still excited.</div></div><hr />

Pre rendered trailers are a cop out, they don't show you anything, which is a fact. How is that salty? I was more pointing it out, because that particular poster seems to hate the game, yet still sticks around on here to moan about how shit the game is with no constructive critique, just sandwhich board doom.<br />
<br />

<br />
I didn't say it wasn't creative, I said that comparing a single player sandbox RPG to an MMO running on a 10 year old engine isn't a fair comparison and you know it. Even the whole smartphone extra thing isn't new. I like it, and I totally want the collectors edition to run the app for Fallout 4 on that pipboy, but it's not new.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, but its not raid ingame cinematic.<br />
<br />
mm, true, but you said mid expansion, not in raid. It could be just something they're planning on doing from now on at a guess, especially given the large amounts of cinematics in WoD. I mean it could be signalling the last riad but at the same time, I cannot see them being stupid enough to give us another year of one raid, given that season 3 stuff has been added.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2015-06-16, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard keeps changing trends this expansion if anyone hasn't noticed. Many of those changes have driven players away while bringing others back. It wouldn't be too surprising if they threw in a cinematic for Archimonde just because they wanted to show something cool but they couldn't do it without resorting to a cinematic.<br />
<br />
At any rate, just because Blizzard's done something in the past doesn't mean that will be true this time. Blizzard's trying new territory and mixing things up. It's certainly possible there could be a 6.3 raid. I certainly hope so or else this expansion's an expensive flop for fans. Given the amount of cinematics we see throughout WoD questing, possible Blizzard found an easier way to make them so we'll see them more regularly going forward from questing to dungeons to raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And calling WoW a 10 year old game is fair? The latest installment came out November of last year, the game has a massive development team that has been working on it year round for the entire life of the game. Calling it a 10 year old game &quot;and this is why it can't compete or feels stale&quot; is a weak cop out.</div></div><hr />

You used to turn final quest to him but it was change in the more recent builts and you now turn in to Yrel (or Draka?) and the step that awarded the follower doesn't exist anymore. hope they fix it for live and it doesn't end like Choluna/Thisalee.</div></div><hr />

Nope, just need the Tier 3 garrison.</div></div><hr />

Thank you. This was my question as well. Surely don't want to take all my alts through the same garrison questline. Already had to do the intro to Draenor sequence 11 times and I'm just over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He didn't say 10 year old game, he said it was running on a 10 year old engine. Which is probably a rather conservative estimate actually cos it was in development another 5+ years before it even came out. WoW is carrying a lot of baggage and is pretty heavily restricted by what the engine can do these days.</div></div><hr />
