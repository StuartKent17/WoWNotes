If you can’t wait until October to get your hands on the new Alabaster Stormtalon or Alabastor Thunderwing, don’t worry. We’ll be introducing these mounts to the Blizzard Shop and in-game shop as a standalone bundle in August. Players who purchase these mounts this way and also attach a 15th Anniversary Collector’s Edition to their World of Warcraft account by March 31, 2020 will receive a $25 credit to their Blizzard Balance.<br />

GROSS! We waited 15 years, for some recolors of 2 mounts that are already in the game? Like you guys easily could've come up with something much more epic.... A huge party zepplin comes to mind, that would be a cool mount. Or just anything really, rather than some uncolored &quot;recolors&quot; of some mounts already in game.</div></div><hr />

Digital deluxe’s have been in the shop since they started giving mounts with collectors editions and the collectors edition it self is the same price they always are. You really are just looking to complain with no thought into it.</div></div><hr />

I mean that would require them actually putting effort into that version of the game.<br />

Boohoo?<br />

If you want the mounts you have an expensive way to get them and a cheaper way to get them. If you don't want them don't get them.<br />

Yeah the colouring does make them look like one of those Beta objects where it's just pure white doesn't it?<br />
<br />
Caught me off guard at first too. <br />

They should be Crystal imo. Since that traditionally celebrates a 15 year anniversary if I recall?</div></div><hr />

They are at least new models and I like the aesthetic. Wowhead already showed in the anniversary they're going to let us mount Deathwing, so there are cool new mounts for everyone.<br />

I think they should've made the alabaster more obvious, or at least gave the armor a gold trim. I do like the idea, but I admit at first glance it can look like an unfinished model.</div></div><hr />

As for the CE. Far too expensive. But of course I guess ActiBlizz had to get their money grabbing ways in somehow on WoW Classic.<br />
<br />
WTF? Them adding these mounts to the store is a good thing for players. This thing is gonna sell out super fast, because it's Blizz so of course there will be limited numbers, then people will resell this thing for upwards of thousands of dollars for a couple of ivory recolored mounts because of their rarity, and putting it on the store this essentially kills that dead. I get it, you hate modern wow. But you are complaining just to complain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you're angry that the CE is too expensive, but also angry that they're making it so people that just want the mounts can get them without buying the whole thing. Okay.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Exkrementor</div><div class="date">2019-05-14, 03:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">100$ minus 25$ for the mount and 13$ for the free month and minus nothing for the mousepad and pin and art prints because they are pretty much worthless.<br />
<br />
So you are pretty much buying a Ragnaros statue for about 60$. Thats ok I guess. Considering you dont have to buy classic at all, this is a nice item for collectors.<br />
<br />
The mounts look kinda lame but at least they are not usable in classic. Could you imagine the outrage of all 3 classic youtubers? #nochanges blabla nobody cares</div></div><hr />

Or couldn't they give you the original vanilla collectors edition pet? Since you are literally buying the vanilla collectors edition again and it still won't be account wide? That doesn't violate the &quot;no changes&quot; rule and actually adds in something that was around IN VANILLA.<br />

Your hyperbole is ridiculous. First, you can use any mount, flying or not, at any time. Whether they fly or not is the next point, and is usually half the expansion (and you can still fly in all previous content as well).</div></div><hr />

None of the other CEs have come with a 10 inch statue like that. If you're buying this, it's for Ragnaros. A 10 inch statue of that scale would often retail for much more than $100. It's not a bad deal.<br />

The real funny thing is that you won't be able to use those mounts in Classic.</div></div><hr />

Is there even a copy of the game / digital code / whatever in it? From what I see it looks like collectibles, game time and mounts that you can only use in retail.....<br />

<br />
If you seriously waited 15 years for that, there may be something wrong with you O.o.<br />
<br />
But yeah the mounts could of been a bit more special. They tried to channel something very classic, which I understand. I wouldn't be surprised if the main point of it is the statue and everything else is just stuff they decided to throw in there really quickly.</div></div><hr />

We’ll be introducing these mounts to the Blizzard Shop and in-game shop as a standalone bundle in August. Players who purchase these mounts this way and also attach a 15th Anniversary Collector’s Edition to their World of Warcraft account by March 31, 2020 will receive a $25 credit to their Blizzard Balance.<br />

In August, there will be threads with people saying how Blizzard lied to them and tricked them into buying the Collectors Edition and how they aren't exclusive... just like they did with the boat.</div></div><hr />

Open the picture and you can tell they're not untextured. :p They're designed to look like living statues, like animated golems or something.<br />

You can choose to spend your money on whatever you want. Personally, I think the Rags statue alone is amazing and close to a $99 price tag. I’d rather it be more red/orange than golden, but still awesome looking. As others have said, unless it’s straight up cheap plastic, the Rag statue alone would go for close to $100. You also get in game mounts at $50 range, as well as a mouse pad which can usually range $5-20 depending on type and who makes it.<br />
It being dogshit is your opinion. <br />
As stated, people buy things off the store all the time. The point was Blizz is refunding you money that you spent so you can spend elsewhere if you purchase the mount(s) early, which you can choose to spend on other mounts/pets/toys, or apply it to your monthly sub or for a race change or server swap or anything else offered by the store. You could even apply it to your next game purchase if you want as it is Blizzard balance as far as I understand.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, I know. There’s a picture of it on the 1st page. Like I said, I think it looks great. That said, I’m not close enough to see it or touch it and say whether it’s just really nice detailed cheap plastic or full on resin. Resin always has a better look and feel and is worth more. Also, I’d rather it be orange and red for the fire look, but still think this is very nicely detailed.</div></div><hr />

It's not a Classic collectors edition, it's a 15th Anniversary Collector’s Edition. You know, that World of Warcraft has been out for 15 years...<br />

Classic wont cost more then the sub and will be available for download for everyone with a regular sub running.</div></div><hr />

The 25 bnet balance is only if you get the collector's edition and buy the mounts early from the shop (basically a refund for the shop mounts).</div></div><hr />

I don't really see people clamoring to buy the alabaster mounts, but for the diehard collectors that want a $100 statue and the fancy box, I guess they're a nice inclusion.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
What the hell is up with that mousepad.... Classic Azeroth, Outland and DRAENOR of all things are on it. Weird mousepad for a Classic theme.<br />
<br />
It's an Anniversary theme not a Classic theme? It's called &quot;15th Anniversary Collector's Edition.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nowadays you don't have to buy any expac before BfA and there is no battlechest. It's simple, creating account is free, inactive account can play up to 20 level and account with sub but without BfA up to 110 level. BfA will likely join base game around 9.0 pre-patch.<br />
<br />
I believe collectors edition come with 30 days game time, so it's something like old battlechest, but you can use it on every account.</div></div><hr />

On the other hand, Illidan statue and Jaina were out of stock in EU too but they came back there for the same price a couple of days later. Amazon.de would be the logical choice, but then again usually local Gamestops etc. have these in stock too.</div></div><hr />

What's weird is Amazon UK won't ship this to Northern Ireland which is part of the UK. There are some restriction with shipping things like knifes/flammables which is understandable but they've shipped weirder collector's edition here (such as one with nightvision googles) and they would ship the SWTOR collectors which also had a statuette.</div></div><hr />

It does not include a game. It is a 15th anniversary collectors bundle. All it includes is 30 days of game time. You are not paying for literally the same CE. There is no way to offer a digital download because it isn't a game. You can buy the mounts separately which is essentially the digital download as that is the only digital good it includes. This isn't a Classic CE version. It isn't even available until after Classic launches.</div></div><hr />

Game is most likely a digital download only. As for the mounts being usable in classic, wouldn't that go against what people are asking for classic to be? Store mounts = changes.</div></div><hr />

Fair enough. Thing is, you get the game digitally for free anyhow, if you have a sub....or so I understand it. I wonder if you can even refuse to download it, when your Blizzard launcher is ready to grab it.<br />

FFS Could they just fix the goddamn wings on that bloody gryphon if they're intent on giving us even more gryphons. This is getting infuriating. <br />
<br />
when did any bird hold its wings by origami-ing them up like that? Come on guys, your model making has come along since MOP. I'm sure you can make it so when its wings close they don't look shit and look like an actual birds wings when they're closed. I mean, they could even have a &quot;closed wing&quot; model that the wing swaps to when it goes down if it's really hard to get it to go to the right shape.</div></div><hr />

Where do you live? It's best to double check with Amazon.co.uk support. On my Desktop PC it says it does deliver to Belgium while on my laptop it says it doesn't.

Yeah, I’m really hoping that’s not all that is left or I will just miss out. Unless I could find it somewhere reasonably priced, but doubt that. So I’ll just hope Blizz adds more units.</div></div><hr />

If 99 dollars is &quot;expensive&quot; or &quot;too much&quot; or something, perhaps you should just go to work or something. Normal person doesn't care about hundred dollars, it is as disposable as toilet paper. Really, this place reeks of poverty. Usually these folks who think 99 bucks is too much have no problem whatsoever in buying beer for twice that much during one week or are still driving fossil fueled cars.

dude i dont think you know what the real world is like, but a 11 inch statue like that is far more then 30 fucking bucks, so is 10$ for a few top quality art prints.<br />

Fair enough. Thing is, you get the game digitally for free anyhow, if you have a sub....or so I understand it. I wonder if you can even refuse to download it, when your Blizzard launcher is ready to grab it.<br />

So you are pretty much buying a Ragnaros statue for about 60$. Thats ok I guess. Considering you dont have to buy classic at all, this is a nice item for collectors.<br />

The mounts look kinda lame but at least they are not usable in classic. Could you imagine the outrage of all 3 classic youtubers? #nochanges blabla nobody cares<br />

Ain't available at Amazon either. I think they're just evaluating the numbers now and will create the necessary amount of copies based on the preorders.

True enough. I snagged my copy from Amazon last night since the EU version was sold out (it was there for sale this morning when I checked). At least the .de and .co.uk Amazon list it as sold out. Amazing though, unless the CE version ain't EXTREMELY limited, I think Blizzard reaaaally underestimated the popularity of Classic. I wonder if this will impact the future of current WoW though. Since BfA is quite horseshit as it is now.</div></div><hr />

Well, in US it didn’t sell out so quickly, so I presume they didn’t expect many Europeans to be interested... beats me, just means it’s value is going to be colossal, maybe like the original classic’s CE.</div></div><hr />

Could go down to your local GameStop and see if you can reserve it if you want it that bad. I already have a statue that Blizz sent me for their 10 year anniversary (I was one of the &quot;lucky&quot; ones to keep my account running for 10 years solid). It's still sitting in the box it came in. Don't know what I would do with a Rag statue. Might pick up the mounts later, but who knows.</div></div><hr />

It is completely possible that more will be released as the statuette probably requires more lead time for stock and seeing demand they may decide more runs of the statuette are worth it.</div></div><hr />

If anyone in their right mind thinks this is worth $100 they are going off of pure sentimental value and not looking at all with the contents in the package.

All right, that sounds too awesome to be real. Source?</div></div><hr />

That's the second line of this post <br />

<br />
Players will be able to take part in a 25 Player Raid Finder Experience for iconic bosses, rewarding the Obsidian Worldbreaker (Deathwing) mount.<br />

RIP me, didn't see that thing yesterday, all sold out and it'll probably cost 10x the original price from freaking resellers, I hate this world.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vynestra</div><div class="date">2019-05-15, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah that sold out really quickly - I imagine they'll re-stock, but who knows.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">StationaryHawk</div><div class="date">2019-05-15, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I know people are willing to buy it. But that's also (apparently) a bug in the store and it should allow people to buy it still.<br />
<br />
You can't &quot;Sell out&quot; of a product that hasn't even begun production. You absolutely can. That production hasn't begun doesn't mean they're willing or able to produce enough to meet demand.<br />
<br />
<br />
If anyone in their right mind thinks this is worth $100 they are going off of pure sentimental value and not looking at all with the contents in the package. I mean, honestly, look at what it gives you and then look at what a traditional $80 - $100 collector's edition gives you in many other games. It's definitely overpriced, but there are clearly a lot of people who don't care for the intrinsic value of the product and just wanna buy something and (Hopefully) also support the game.<br />
<br />
Although I'm assured that a good chunk of the buyers just want the shiny.I can't think of much that you could say to convince me when your argument consists of &quot;the mounts are ugly, so they're worth nothing.&quot; If there's nothing that interests you, feel free to not buy it.</div></div><hr />

Someone posted on the wow fb they ordered 5 for reselling, so yeah.<br />
<br />
Why they didn't limit it 1 per battle.net account and persons name/address is beyond me.<br />
<br />
They encourage this kind of behavior.</div></div><hr />

The fact that so many people bought it just shows that a good amount of people don't have good money management skills.<br />
<br />
Or you know we manage or money just fine and have some left over to spend on things we want.</div></div><hr />

same stuff as with blizzcon tickets.</div></div><hr />

Holy smokes, shows how much I read. lol Now THAT'S an anniversary gift to the players. Let the speculation begin regarding which bosses will be featured.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is most likely marketing stunt to make impression of extremly limited supply to booost sales once they &quot;re-enable &quot; it in game store in couple of days/weeks.<br />
<br />
why ? to boost financial numbers before june 30 .<br />
<br />
they found obvious solution for Q2 of 2019 with no games releasing now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">woofpup</div><div class="date">2019-05-15, 03:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Add all the previous Collector's Edition pets to it and you have a deal.<br />

Alas, it's sold out and Blizz doesn't know when they will get more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
no wonder. my guess a lot of europeans dont want to risk and hunt for us stores. 100$ shipping is still cheaper then buying it for 500$ on ebay .<br />
<br />
its a shitty marketing practive on blizzard but well it works.<br />
<br />
add to this all the scalpers who realised easy money . <br />
<br />
i bet you 90% of those which sold out will end up on ebay by tomorrow.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">eduwneso</div><div class="date">2019-05-16, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course they would announce this money grab along with the Classic launch... gotta admit their marketing strategies are good. A lot of people will compensate their classic hype by buying this smokescreen.<br />
<br />
I won't play or touch classic and I love the design of the box and the statue of ragnaros so I reserved it, for 100€ it's pretty sweet.<br />

Wait, so WoW Classic launches in August but the Collector's Edition releases in October?? Hardcore fans need to wait a couple months or what?<br />
<br />
it's for the 15 anniversary not classic, I was confused at first 2.<br />
<br />

First time i will skip a Collector's Edition of WoW.<br />
<br />
Not because of the looks, but WoW just doesn't do it for me anymore.<br />
<br />
You sire, are a very good person. Politely explaining why you won't buy it and it does makes sense, unlike some here.<br />
<br />
FYI I'm not veing sarcastic here.<br />

Oh look who's back at it again, our lovely Eleccybubb. Looks like you're banned, though. What a shame.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah what a shame, Today is a bright day, I got to work, have some fun stuff to do, I slep well and then I saw that he is banned, This just made my day!<br />
<br />
btw, I already reserved this edition and I love it!</div></div><hr />
