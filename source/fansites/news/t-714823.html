Battle.net Facebook Integration<br />
The news was posted on the official WoW forums and we can assume that it will also affect our lovely game when the new version of Battle.net goes live.<br />
The action taking place on the battlefield is just one part of the StarCraft II experience -- we're also working to make sure that you can easily connect, communicate, and play with your friends. To help accomplish that, the new version of Battle.net will offer integration with Facebook. This new functionality will start off by allowing you to quickly import Facebook friends into your Battle.net friends list, and additional features will be added over time. For more information, check out the official announcement.<br />
<br />
Press Release<br />
PARIS, France – May 5, 2010 - Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. announced today that its Battle.net® gaming service will integrate with Facebook®, linking the world's premier online gaming platform with the world's most popular social platform. The first step in the integration will enable StarCraft® II: Wings of Liberty™ players to quickly add Blizzard gamers who are friends on Facebook to their Battle.net friend lists, facilitating their social gaming experience on the service.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're pleased to be working with Facebook to integrate their platform with Battle.net to enhance the social-entertainment experience for our players,&quot; said Paul Sams, chief operating officer of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;This new functionality will make it easier than ever to connect with friends on Battle.net and play StarCraft II and future Blizzard Entertainment games together.&quot;<br />
<br />
The new Facebook functionality in Battle.net will be tested in the near future via the ongoing StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty beta test and will be available to all StarCraft II players when the game ships later this year. Information about other Facebook-related features on Battle.net will be announced at a later date.<br />

Dalaran Children’s Week Quest Line Issue<br />
We are aware of the issue that is currently affecting the Children’s Week quest line in Dalaran which does not allow players who have completed the quest line last year to take part in it again this year. We do not currently have a fix planned to address this issue at this point in time.<br />
<br />
To clarify, this issue won't be able to be resolved for Children's Week this year. If you completed the quest previously you won't be able to complete it again for the other pet this year.<br />
<br />
Blue posts<br />
Capped stats<br />
It's better now, but GotEM and Celestial Focus (and talents of that ilk in all specs) still provide too much haste such that its realistic to get capped. Any class with so much vested in instant spells risks not valuing haste as much as other casters. That's okay to a point, but a big focus of Cataclysm is not to have these situations where players dismiss as junk gear that is targeted for them because one of &quot;their&quot; stats (meaning things like crit and haste for a healer, not hit or Agi) become excessively devalued relative to another stat. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24630603049/healing-touch/))<br />
<br />
Mandatory Glyphs/Talents<br />
We're stuck in this trap sometimes where players want glyphs and talents to be meaningful but optional. That's a pretty narrow design space.<br />
<br />
If we make a talent that affects Shield Wall, then it feels mandatory. If we make no talent that affects Shield Wall, then it feels like the talents aren't affecting things you actually care about and can become this potentially marginalized aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
The argument seems to be that if you didn't have to get Improved Disciplines, that you could get some other potentially juicy talent. True. The same would be true if you didn't have to get Shockwave or if paladins didn't have to get Ardent Defender. You need Improved Disciplines, but they need Vindication. My point is that classes are balanced as part of their entire package. You aren't balanced at the core level with talents and glyphs thrown on as gravy on top of that.<br />
<br />
Now we are making an attempt with Cataclysm to give players more options in how they talent. But still if you imagine a talent tree in which every single talent is optional, it's also hard to imagine how every single talent is interesting or powerful enough.

Lack of new healing spells<br />
Paladins are getting several new healing spells. Druids aren't, so I figured it was worth a little bit of explanation for why we made that decision. The short answer is that we're trying to find homes for all those druid spells that don't get much use. A devious alternative I suppose would be to cut Healing Touch and Regrowth and then make new druid spells to fill in the holes with different names. The druids that are going to be the most sad about the healing changes will be those who like just using the same couple of spells (Rejuv + WG in today's environment) over and over. I can't offer to much to placate them, except that unless you're up against the game's most challenging content, you have a lot more flexibility in how you choose to play your character.<br />
<br />
Lifebloom is a good tank healing spell. Sorry if you find that delusional. (If you disagree with that, I assume it's because you put the paladin on the tank and the druid on the raid. That's a fine strategy, but we want to create more room for both classes to branch out.) Healing Touch is not, but that's for several reasons that we now have a chance to address: 1) Certain talents / glyphs / set bonus shore up spells like Rejuv a lot. 2) Healing Touch currently would overheal a lot. 3) Players would currently die while winding up a heal with such a long cast time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/24630603049/healing-touch/))<br />
<br />
Healing mechanics<br />
<br />
We're not getting rid of the notion of druids using lots of hots when healing. We think that's an important part of the spec. There are some players who want to cast almost nothing but hots though, or some players who don't see anything wrong with the strategy of trying to keep Rejuv up on as many targets as possible whether or not they are taking damage. We want druids to make more *decisions* about which spells to cast and which target to heal. Some of you claim you do that today, and that's great. We want to reward you more for being good at that.<br />
<br />
There are several heals that are just doing too much work individually in the current game, which makes other spells seem relatively pointless by comparison. Rejuv and Wild Growth are two of them, but so are Circle of Healing, Power Word: Shield, Holy Light, Flash of Light and others. It's not that the numbers are just borked on those spells (though they probably are in some cases). It's just that the current environment really rewards over-reliance on certain spells. We think the Cataclysm healing game will be more dynamic. There will be fights that emphasize efficiency and fights that emphasize triage and I'm sure there will still be fights that emphasize quick timing and spamming -- just hopefully not as many.

Deep Wounds<br />
<br />
There are several posters in this very thread though saying it's not fair that they can't always get Deep Wounds in their tanking build for threat. Threat talents like Defiance were something we cut awhile ago because players thought they were mandatory and uninteresting. If threat was relatively easy to maintain today, then all of those talents might be considered junk and warriors would be asking for more talents that actually made a difference when they invested in them.<br />
<br />
I'm not trying to dismiss your feedback, but I am saying it's not as easy as you make it sound. In a perfect world, players would like for their class to be fully functional and completely balanced. Only then do they get to choose talents and glyphs. We have to factor all of that power and utility in though. The alternative is a talent tree that looks a lot like minor glyphs where the choices are all cosmetic and the effects pretty trivial. This is why I'm trying to steer the topic away from warrior vs. paladin and get players to focus more on what fun talents and fun glyphs look like. Warbringer... Sword and Board... awesome. I get that. I'm not sure how realistic it is to have a tree with 51 talent point like that and with no Improved Disciplines or Toughness (which someone else brought up earlier). A few players opined that the existing Glyph of Shield Wall would feel awesome if it was reversed with the base Shield Wall. Feedback like that is really useful.

<br />
Yes, and it's a choice that 90% of Facebook/WoW users will make without really thinking about the consequences.<br />
<br />
I also wouldn't be surprised if they put little &quot;Fb&quot; buttons all over the place so that you'll be tempted to accidentally click on them. They do that for every other news/networking website. They were even talking about having it automatically opt-in, forcing you to opt-out from some arcane set of checkboxes deep in your privacy settings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only thing is, Blizz has stated that they will be fixing up BN so you can see when your friends are on, even in another game.<br />
<br />
What's to say they won't be doing it by using Facebook as the delivery method, requiring a FB account to access the cross-game friends feature? (I'm not saying they WILL, or that I even THINK they will. It's just a possibility, and only a random thought I had.)</div></div><hr />

Rejuv and Wild Growth are two of them, but so are Circle of Healing, Power Word: Shield, Holy Light, Flash of Light and others.<br />

Anyone find it amusing that he lists both Paladin healing spells? Considering Paladins only really have 2 healing spells this might point to a reason why they are overused and spammed ;-) lol.</div></div><hr />

You won't be able to look at people's Battle.net accounts and add them or view their Facebook profile. However, you'll be able to see which of your CURRENT Facebook friends have a battle.net account and then add them. It takes away the asking of FRIENDS and just lets you know who among you play Blizzard games.<br />

To be honest, I wish Xbox Live and PlayStation Network had similar functions. Now stop you whining over trivial changes! ;D</div></div><hr />

Why should anyone care if you play WoW or not? Is playing WoW going to somehow devalue you to your friends? If that's the case then I suggest you look for new friends...<br />

Sure, this isn't a big deal. But it makes me wonder what flaw that could arise next.<br />
<br />
<br />
To clarify for some of you people. I know that I will have a choice. I will not integrate my accounts. But from security view this might open a new form of potential scamming/hacking channel. Even if you got good security awareness there are people that don't have it. Your friends could possibly drag you into trouble just by knowing you. I can imagine that an increased number of posts will say: &quot;Heyy Blizzzz, i want myy money baack cus i got hacked and didnt click any viirus so u fucked up, kk ty bye&quot;.

Not counting myself into the ones that might be a easy target. I'm mostly thinking about other people here. I care for others or something along that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To clarify, this issue won't be able to be resolved for Children's Week this year. If you completed the quest previously you won't be able to complete it again for the other pet this year.&quot; <br />
<br />
Reseting a quest is hard amirite? -.-<br />
<br />
Ok its a little more complicated but nothing they shouldnt have been able to fix during the first day when people started to report it. And then apply the fix on tuesday/wednesday during the maintenance. <br />
<br />
Its more likely that they are not reseting the quest because the players who didnt do it last year would be able to get both of them during the same Childrens Week if they performed a reset now. <br />

Well, its just another year.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Since you don't care how popular you are, I would assume any one you invited to be your facebook friend was because you really want them to, and not just to seem popular.<br />
<br />
So if they decide to un-friend you to avoid annoying spam, it would seem likely that you've lost a facebook friend that you didn't want to lose.<br />
<br />
But that's just me applying basic reasoning skills, so that may not apply to you.</div></div><hr />

Well, I have around 50 friends last time I checked, and most of them are people I know from school. And that's about 90%. The other 10% would be made up of my WoW friends, or other internet-related people. Now, let's put it this way, I have very few friends at school. I'd say... maybe 5 or 6 that I'd consider to be my really good friends that I talk to and hang around with a lot. And... only one of these people actually have a Facebook of their own. <br />
<br />
So it's kinda down to the person, really, and what kind of friends they have both on Facebook and WoW.</div></div><hr />

The action taking place on the battlefield is just one part of the StarCraft II experience -- we're also working to make sure that you can easily connect, communicate, and play with your friends. To help accomplish that, the new version of Battle.net will offer integration with Facebook. This new functionality will start off by allowing you to quickly import Facebook friends into your Battle.net friends list, and additional features will be added over time. For more information, check out the official announcement.<br />
<br />
Press Release<br />
PARIS, France – May 5, 2010 - Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. announced today that its Battle.net® gaming service will integrate with Facebook®, linking the world's premier online gaming platform with the world's most popular social platform. The first step in the integration will enable StarCraft® II: Wings of Liberty™ players to quickly add Blizzard gamers who are friends on Facebook to their Battle.net friend lists, facilitating their social gaming experience on the service.<br />
<br />
&quot;We're pleased to be working with Facebook to integrate their platform with Battle.net to enhance the social-entertainment experience for our players,&quot; said Paul Sams, chief operating officer of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;This new functionality will make it easier than ever to connect with friends on Battle.net and play StarCraft II and future Blizzard Entertainment games together.&quot;<br />
<br />
The new Facebook functionality in Battle.net will be tested in the near future via the ongoing StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty beta test and will be available to all StarCraft II players when the game ships later this year. Information about other Facebook-related features on Battle.net will be announced at a later date.<br />
<br />
Facebook® is a registered trademark of Facebook Inc. <br />

The Battle.net friends list won't let someone add you if you don't let them. So if you don't want someone to know you're online, don't let them add your RealID.</div></div><hr />

The game already costs $60, which is standard for the best of AAA titles. Lesser titles, including Splinter Cell Conviction, Supreme Commander 2 and The Settlers 7 all recently sold for much less.<br />
<br />
Perhaps the initial cost of Battle.net was calculated in the price of the game, but its upkeep will have to come from elsewhere. Battle.net has always been free and making users pay any monthly fee for it would damage the platform.<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard has been getting more and more creative with methods of financing their business and turning up a profit. They are treating the company like a business, and like it or not, this is good business.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but make it Domino's and make sure they get a UK deal too.<br />
