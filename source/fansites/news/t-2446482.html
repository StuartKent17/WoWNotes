Build a Panel - World Creation in World of Warcraft<br />
<br />
The team likes the designers to have the freedom to explore the space that they are creating.<br />
Kul Tiras has been in Warcraft lore from the beginning so the team knew it would be a hearty sea-faring culture from Gilneas.<br />
Boralus<br />
<br />
Creating cities in WoW is one of the hardest things that the world builders have to do in WoW.<br />
Early versions of cities have red lines for roads and green spaces for buildings.<br />
The second phase of creating a city has early renderings of buildings so that the design team can figure out how the player navigates the space.<br />
Scale is also a huge part of this phase.<br />
Hamburg, Germany and cities in France were looked at for inspiration for Boralus.<br />
Boralus had many iterations as time went on.<br />
Safe roads were added over time (easy to navigate roads with no hostile mobs).<br />
<br />
<br />
Underrot<br />
<br />
Hulling out a road is the first step in creating a dungeon once you have the initial map.<br />
Secondary textures and terrain detail come next.<br />
Certain parts of the terrain lead you in the direction that you need to go.<br />
Busy areas are often next to areas that are not busy to add contrast.<br />
Underrot was supposed to be a zone originally, but it wasn't working out. Eventually they decided it worked better as a dungeon.<br />
<br />
Arathi Basin Remastered<br />
<br />
They are still using the engine from vanilla.<br />
They wanted to keep the same feel of Arathi Basin, but just give it the face lift that it deserves.<br />
View distance and opening the space was a big part of the remaster for Arathi Basin.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team likes to add Easter eggs to zones when possible.<br />
One Easter egg was a baby in a bird nest in a tree that the designer thought no one would find, but she checked Reddit and the players did!<br />
Some art is purposeful to trick players into a certain direction, such as leaning trees or lighting.<br />
Iteration is next. They want to make sure the zone is not monotonousness and feels right.<br />
Sometimes they design and create a zone that they love, but when they start to navigate it they realize that they hate it.<br />
A lot of times they design things that don't work in the moment, but will be saved for later expansions.<br />
Suramar and the disguise mechanic was a little iffy when it was first pitched, but it worked out well.<br />
Drustvar started off as a frozen wasteland inspired by &quot;beyond the wall&quot; in Game of Thrones.<br />
<br />
Several months in the team decided it wasn't working and changed it to the creepy forest that it is today.<br />
Originally there were only several witch camps on the outskirts, but eventually they incorporated more of that theme.<br />
<br />
A Horde symbol was placed where Varian's tomb is during design as a joke, but was obviously removed before live.<br />
Putting an oasis in the middle of Vol'dun was done to break up the monotony of the desert.<br />
Small details are added as the final step.<br />
Little props are time consuming, but they tell small stories that add to the environment.<br />
Lighting can be used to highlight parts of the environment.<br />
This expansion in particular emphasizes the teams working together to tell the story.<br />
It is incredible being able to work on a game this long and learn from player feedback.<br />
WoW doesn't feel like one game. It feels like each expansion is a way to tell a different story.<br />
Amazing things are coming!<br />
<br />

Darin Depaul is the good old blizzard heart and soul enthusiasm that the Developer today no longer has. He is a breath of fresh air!<br />
<br />
He needs to open next years Blizzcon and all further Blizzcons lol</div></div><hr />

Therein lies the problem. Each expansion completely invalidates the previous ones. :(</div></div><hr />

They're just updating the old art and textures. And because Classic is a thing now they have all the reason in the world to improve old visuals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this will ensure complete failure of classic once modern players wil ltry it :)<br />
<br />
im really happy<br />
<br />
also 16 debuff limit ? lololololol this makes once again 3/4 of classes efectively usless - feel sorry for poor naive people who will roll anything but bis specs/classes</div></div><hr />

There were just too damn many of them. It would have been better to have a much smaller coven to keep some of the mystery and make it not feel like every single woman in the entire zone was a witch. After a while we were just carving through witches like murlocks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
interesting. I don't have any addons on the server I play on and always get into a group relatively quickly as a rogue. <br />
<br />
You're being overly dramatic. And clueless<br />
<br />
Also the debuff limit is meaningless. So much drama for a Saturday</div></div><hr />

Too bad they didn't apply their city-building formula to Dazar'alor. So terrible as a functional, engaging city. I bet it's going be great for the raid though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
a lot of their &quot;improvements&quot; have inferior color scheme and depth, which is why it's a bit sad to see replacements with no options; they don't have all the reasons to improve visuals, if the visual are pretty in the first place</div></div><hr />
