This change is currently live.<br />
<br />
This is a change very late into a tier, which leads me to believe that when WoD comes out this change won't be live and will still require guilds on the same server to tackle Mythic raiding.<br />
Correct -- current-tier Mythic raiding in Warlords will still be limited to players from a single server. In the meantime, though, this change may help guilds that are trying to recruit and grow in preparation for Mythic raiding.<br />
<br />
As for realm firsts, realm firsts are guild achievements; you need to be in a guild group, which is by definition 8/10 or 20/25 members coming from a single guild on a single server. You could theoretically have a couple of guests from a different server and still claim the realm first, but ultimately 80% of the group still has to be from the same guild.</div></div><hr />

You'll still be able to obtain the Cutting Edge achievements associated with defeating Garrosh on Heroic difficulty. There have been no changes made aside from allowing players to form cross-realm raid groups for Normal or Heroic Siege of Orgrimmar.

Should be. The difficulty still hasn't changed. They also said server 1st's are still obtainable if the group consists of 80% from the same guild.</div></div><hr />

What would be the in-game incentive? You still can't trade gold and such cross realm so why would the carrying guild give away the mount for essentially free, barring any ToS-violating transactions?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I tend to think the opposite. Subs are bleeding and this just feels like a way to try to keep a few more to stay with easier ability to pug. At the start of SoO my guild was running multiple 10 mans for ppl who's computer couldn't handle 25 and two 25 mans. All but 1 were doing heroics. Now we're struggling to fill our main 25 and when we do run a 10 it's comprised of mostly alts from the 25. We're one of the lucky guilds still managing to even go. Cross realm will help us maintain a roster for our 25 for a bit with the ability to still bring some capable people. But it worries me that a guild as large as mine is even having trouble maintaining a roster. Smaller guilds have all but died out. <br />
<br />
If WoD doesn't at least go into beta soon this isn't going to end well for the sub base. People are bored. And it won't take long b4 dangling that wolf mount no longer matters. I've been playing for a long time. I've never seen ppl quitting at this rate.</div></div><hr />

Was happening with CM achievements. Not sure why people dont think there is not a market for it and those who do it dont always get caught or get perma bans. In the case of a perma ban one could just buy another account and there is a 90 boost now. So risk vs reward and for some the risk is part of the fun. People have also been known to use gold sellers to get past the cross realm trading issue which then still requires Blizzard to take action against accounts. <br />

The last bot ban wave included a bunch of people who did not get perma bans prior to disputing which is different to how Blizzard handled bot ban waves prior, especially when WoW was more popular. Bots farming mats might hurt the market, but dont give an ingame advantage like the recent one that gives you a competitive edge in PVP and PVE. Blizzard ban hammer over the past few years has been questionably limp.</div></div><hr />

Why join a guild on a another server when you can just cross realm it and not transfer or be a part of that guilds raiding community. Competition in heroic raiding will just end up being moot now. Thanks Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Recruitment wont be broken for this, because its highly doubtful that WoD raids will be X-realm from the start.<br />
Mythic is already announced it isnt affected by this, and i really doubt if any other difficulty besides flex would be X-realm from the release.<br />
<br />
It gives multiple opportunities:<br />
- trying out potential raiders during their trial, without a trial spending money on a transfer to a dead realm or anything<br />
- filling the spots of people who arent able to raid a certain day due to stuff with a well known / trusted real id friend<br />
- Brining back people to try out this content and get ready for WoD (even tho its far away)<br />
<br />
Although the downside:<br />
- It probably ruins Flex right now<br />
- Boosts, like mentioned before<br />
- I expect nerfs in the coming future, due to people complaining about their Pug, they couldnt kill boss X or boss Y. <br />
- Removal or lowering dropchances maybe on the HC mount. (not sure, but i wouldnt be surprised to reduce the selling of said mounts) <br />
- Even tho mounts from HC content got sold for years now, ever they got introduced<br />
<br />
Overall, cant say i am happy with this change, but yeah, what can we do!</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Yes, there will people selling heroic runs and mounts.<br />
2. Yes, there will be probably hundreds of thousands of players who can now easily progress into SoO normal.<br />
<br />
Everything that gets added to the game comes with a cost and a possibility of doing a little harm. But the benefits of this far outweigh them. OpenRaid is going to explode this week as tons of people on Med and Low population servers will more easily be able to do ´new´ content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So blizzard making it easier for us 10man guilds, like mine to recruit for the upcoming expansion where 20man raid groups are required to do Heroics(Mythics) is a bad decision? <br />
And just a few weeks ago everyone was outraged about how hard it will be... Now we have a guy here bitching about them making it easier for us @__@<br />
<br />
But seriously, Every argument I'm seeing here is irrelevant...<br />
<br />
1) Many guilds are already selling Heroic/Normal Carryings through out content, Especially over here on illidan we have about 7 guilds selling 14/14 Heroic clears every week and this isn't the only realm doing it, One of them even does it for money AND gold.<br />
<br />
2) Gold Sellers.. What? How does this effect gold sellers at all ? You still can't trade cross realm..<br />
<br />
3) How is this bad? For years people have consistently and always been bitching &quot;Oh wah wah, Im on dead pop realm, can't raid&quot; Cross realm Raiding! no need for transfers to raid now! &quot;OH WTF BLIZZ YOU DONE FUCK UP&quot; What? Common guys, stop being spoiled brats<br />
<br />
4) How is this going to affect the difficulty of heroics or normals at all from how it is now? Shit is already getting consistently nerfed due to bitching, Cross realm raiding isn't gunna change whats already been there since.. forever?<br />
<br />
5) How does this destroy recruiting? If anything , like I said for us 10man heroic guilds that gotta go 20man to raid heroics(mythic) next expack, this edition is damn near glorious. It allows us to recruit people in from other realms, trial them so they and us can make the decision of wither or not it is worth the 25$ for them to realm transfer rather then them wasting their money(This is what stops most people from realm transfering for a guild)<br />
<br />
<br />
Seriously... How can you bitch about this change? And oh, It also allows you to do normal/heroics with your friends who you couldn't do so previously with, Idk about you guys but I have a lot of friends who play on different realms.</div></div><hr />

I believe this is the worst change ever in WoW history. I get that it's temporary and meant to deal with guilds entirely falling apart over the up and coming months, but it is a real slap in the face, especially to small guilds who preserve on awful servers.<br />

<br />
They could. It'd only take one person to provide proof and report it though, as selling in game things such as challenge mode runs, heroic raid runs for real money is against the TOS and thus is a bannable offense. Doing it for gold is cool though and a pretty damn good idea to fill the guild coffers before WoD.<br />

<br />
Unless that 14/14 H guild is super desperate they're not going to be recruiting too many people below their completion level. If a person in say a 6/14 heroic guild really stood out in logs then the more advanced guilds would of put their feelers out long before this announcement and probably would of pinched them by now. And if not, what good would it do to do so now? They have confirmed Mythic will not be cross realm in WoD, so why does it matter in the long run? It'll still cost that person money to transfer servers for Mythic WoD and if they wanted to transfer before for better guilds, would they not of done so already?<br />
<br />
Lets pretend every progressed guild in the world is suddenly desperate for recruits for WoD and this was a permanent cross realm change for including Mythic WoD. this still doesn't magically change the fact that a lot of people cannot raid on certain days and cannot raid during certain times.<br />
<br />
Tl;Dr version: The amount of people this will effect in a negative manner is very insignificant at best. It will effect some people yes, but so will every change they make ever.</div></div><hr />

you seem to be exaggerating a lot. also do you mean this change is awful or mythic not being cross realm is awful? Sorry but the disadvantages of cross realm mythics for the new expansion outweight the advantages. Your superlatives really ruin your argument/</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except it doesn't. In WoD the current heroics and normals use cross realm technology ala flex right now anyway and has been since the announcement of WoD. Mythic will not be cross realm in WoD. In reality nothing has really changed except they're implementing their planned changes early. In fact if you're running a smaller guild on a dead server right now this is actually a positive step if you use it correctly. Example: You can put your feelers out to other smaller guilds on different servers in the same time zone to do a joint run to get both guilds into raiding easier.</div></div><hr />

Good guilds will not suffer from this. They will get the advantage from it. This crossrealm raid option will offer a perfect solution for players not in a guild or in a guild that is terrible in skills or with despotic officers. Freedom at last! It's so cool!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Being able to fight and struggle against people you don't already know personally? The real &quot;point&quot; you seem to venerate died the day they let you roll both factions on the same server for PVP servers. Hell, on my old PVP server everybody had max level characters in both factions. You know those mega-guild cesspools where people run scripts and spam all unguilded characters to join them? That, but they did it on both sides and everybody rolled both sides. So now if they want to grief you, your ass is gonna get griefed no matter which faction you're on and it's by the same people. Where's your player-faction-god now?<br />
<br />
My point is that after nine years some of us have characters who are now in the wrong faction to raid with our raiding friends, and some of us have friends in both factions. It would not be a terrible thing if we could raid/run dungeons/*gasp* do quests with those friends. They could do it like they do cross-realm - you show up as your leader's faction.</div></div><hr />

You gotta be out of your mind if you expect it in June still. Not a chance in hell. It's pretty obvious at this point they are aiming for the 10th Anniversery (November 4th, on the nose, is a tuesday).</div></div><hr />

Yeah, no way it's happening in June. Maybe if the beta had come out in early January, but not now. I disagree that they'd be aiming for the 10th anniversary for the simple reason that business almost always trumps sentimentality. The sooner the expansion is out, the better for their bottom line. (Not saying they ought to go willy nilly at breakneck speed, but c'mon...)</div></div><hr />

I think that sentimentality is something Blizzard still holds on to. And expansion on the 10th anniversary is a perfect thing. It also falls within their projected (via pre-order listed dates) release schedule. If they make it by then, remains to be seen. You can't ignore that it falls almost in a destined fashion. November 4th, wow's anniversary date, is on a tuesday this year.</div></div><hr />
