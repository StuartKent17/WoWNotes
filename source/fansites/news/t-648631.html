Blizzcon tickets on sale Saturday 16th<br />
Just to elaborate, we don't have an exact time on when they will be up but our web engineers will need to be here to properly start and monitor the system when it goes live so we don't plan to be doing that in the middle of the night. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/25/17177747672-when-on-saturday-do-tickets-go-on-sale.html))<br />

Free Character Moves<br />
There were a lot of issues with realms queuing a little while back, especially at the launch of Wrath of the Lich King, so Free Character Moves were constantly available to players. Overall the queues are not a big issue right now so we have no had many FCMs lately and generally it takes some really nasty conditions like being stuck in a login queue for over an hour to really convince people to transfer to a new realm.<br />
<br />
We are keeping an eye on things though and working on improving things as always. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/17162146657-any-new-free-xfers-planned.html))<br />

More than 2 Professions at the same time?<br />
We like the idea that players get to choose their professions and not just collect them all. This way players are picking the top 2 that they want or feel are best for their class and not just rampaging through everything for the sake of it. If we did allow players to have more than 2 professions then at the same time we would probably have to limit the perks you get through professions as it would be a big advantage for anybody who has more of them too.</div></div><hr />

Finally I'm not forced to wear these subpar goggles anymore just to keep up. And there was no advantage against other Rogues at all since almost every Rogue I meet on 2.5k+ is an Engineer too. It just gimps you when you meet other classes which don't have stealth.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't done competetive Arena at all and this is sort of a minor reason that kept me from it. I looked at rogues from my battlegroup(and worldwide) and saw that 90% are using the goggles. I personally cba rerolling a profession to have an advantage(or get on the same line?) over others.<br />
<br />
Even in BG's I get frustrated that most rogues find me before I find them as they have the goggles and I don't.<br />
<br />
Just hope they buff engineering some other way so it's not that huge of a nerf.<br />
<br />
<br />
(in before &quot;lol human rogue&quot;: I've got 2 other rogues and I play my cousins too while visiting him so I do have other race experience.(sounds dirty :P ) )<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: And yeah I sorta agree on Human racial aswell. Nerf the fuck out of it imo. No one should have an advantage over another if it has something to do with stealth. i e remove all + stealth and +stealth detection modifiers from the game unless it's an obvious pvp talent.<br />
<br />
Openers are indeed a big part of rogues in PvP so imo all should be at the same line regarding that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course they do, Blizzard can squeeze more money out of Arenatards for less work than Raidingtards. Raidingtards demand new content every few months and bitch if it does/doesn't appeal to 'casuals'. Arenatards can mash their faces together in the same arenas from one expansion to the next as long as new gear is released. Factor in 'tournaments' and other arena related events that Blizzard can charge for and arena really starts bringing in more cash for far less effort.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yeah, I really find wotf as tempting to have as better stealth detection in arena, beacuse everyone knows that rogues weakness are warlocks and priests. But im not arguing that will of the forsaken is a good racial, just saying humans are better. <br />
<br />
Racials in general shouldn't be that, pointed out towards a single class. Warstomp, arcane torrent, escape artist and these kind of racials are balanced because they are usefull against a lot of classes in different ways, while not changing the outcome of an arenagame.<br />
<br />
Glad I made you laugh though.</div></div><hr />

This change has _NO EFFECT_ on any class OTHER than rogues and Feral Druids. Any other class could stack stealth detection any they would still get sapped, and in the end die quicker because they are using out dated gear.<br />
<br />
ROGUES/Ferals stacking stealth detection to get the other sap on OTHER Rogues/Ferals was the problem , it really shows how Dependant rogues are on getting their openers soo much that they will use outdated gear for it.<br />
<br />
It's not even a buff, it's a change, retard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
But what Arenatards cry for, Arenatards get apparently. I think the dev team is getting paid off (either in money or dick-sucking).<br />
<br />
God, because 1 level of stealth detection that only ever was beneficial if you were a rogue or feral druid made it soo special right? <br />
<br />
I swear idiots just complain for the sake of complaining on these comments.</div></div><hr />

The comment look interesting before it got to &quot;retard&quot; and &quot;idiots&quot; part... After that you become much less interesting partner in discussion, you imbecile.<br />
Technically speaking, just from your post the change prevents rogues to be detected by feral druid and therefore *buffs* them at least against feral druid. So, before calling other idiots learn some basic logic, you moron.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lolwut? Not it's not. Stealth detection = PVP, not PVE. This doesn't affect Engi's position as a weak PVE profession in the SLIGHTEST.<br />
<br />
Engi is still the best PVP prof with Nitro Boots and Pyro Rockets. No question.<br />

No. It only affects PVP, and Engi is bar none the BEST profession to have for PVP right now. I'm sorry that you QQ about not getting 40 spell power or 70 AP in your precious PVE, but why the fuck are you the PVP profession in PVE in the first place?</div></div><hr />

Technically speaking, just from your post the change prevents rogues to be detected by feral druid and therefore *buffs* them at least against feral druid. So, before calling other idiots learn some basic logic, you moron. <br />
<br />
<br />
And it stops rogues gaining an advantage against feral druids as well, when both sides are losing the same benefit, it's not a buff, it's a change, asshat. And if anything it would be a NERF, not a buff.</div></div><hr />

Except I do use them, for PvE, if the stealth detection is being used or not isn't the point, the point is that if the stealth detection costs 5 &quot;itemization points&quot; I want to see it moved to another stat, not removed completely.</div></div><hr />

I am engineer on my main (shadow pve priest / disc pvp priest) and my alt, a rogue (which I plan to take into arena soon) is herb/alch. I really thought about how I could best train engineer with this rogue sometimes in the future. Because as it was, you NEEDED the goggles to see other rogues which would see you because they had them. The goggles don't do anything for my priest, I won't see rogues before they sap me with them, and level 80 items are much better anyway.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it would only be logical to remove the human stealth detection racial also. Humans have 6 racials anyway. And it is still such a huge advantage (especially now that goggles are gone) that if you're not human alliance rogue, you should probably reroll if you want to top arena.<br />

Do you even realise that the only people currently using the stealth goggles are other rogues?<br />
Since the Item itself is extremely crap (naxx10) and its gimmicks seem to use abit of Ilevel aswell.<br />
Please feel free to show me 1 player with above 2200 who is actually a rogue and uses them.<br />
I will now continue to explain to you why this is actually a BIG nerf for rogues.<br />
I will assume (which is true) that about 90% of the rogues in high-end arena actually use these goggles, to catch eachother and DRUIDS now I can personally tell you that there are hardly any druids using these goggles, so because a rogue has a higher stealthlevel to begin with +goggles+cloack enchant this means that a rogue, given enough time, will find a druid in just about any arena (maybe BeM is harder and RoL might be harder aswell) forcing the druid to start the game in treeform and prehotting himself or face the dread of being (inevitably) caught and slaughtered with no defences avaible.<br />
<br />
With these nerfed this will change and druids can once again have the advantage of starting in stealth against any rogue-team because they won't be found so easily, so this is a buff to resto/feral druids and a big nerf against rogues, thanks for reading this</div></div><hr />

With removing the stealth detection buff, Blizz has removed choice from gearing up. This is contrary to how they are about iLevel and other instance items. The stealth detection made the goggles a lateral upgrade to the added stats and resilience of the PvP helm. Now, there's no choice at all for what people will be wearing.</div></div><hr />

Congrats, you missed the point entirely. They nerfed to goggles because they took away choice, not give them. If you were a rogue w/o them you were at a severe disadvantage in arena, and pvp in general against others. Stealth classes tend to hunt each other in MMOs.<br />
<br />
Human racial is next on the chopping block. They have too many racials already, which i assume is some attempt to get people to play alliance.</div></div><hr />

You can´t make one type of item good for something and not expect people to &quot;nerf&quot; themself if its some needed advantage overall.

<br />
Rogue engineers were giving up good gear for stealth detection vs other rogue engineers/humans. Now all rogues get the same level of stealth detection and rogue engineers can use way better gear. <br />
<br />
Rogue engineers with better gear = rogue engineers do more damage to all classes and take less damage = rogue engineer buff<br />
<br />
So do not say its not a buff because it is, indirectly at least. I just hope they give engineering something useful.. in the near future. We pretty much just have nerfed versions of old engineering items, but they require higher skill levels. Seriously.. the only useful things are slow fall, the rocket boots and the hand rocket thing, except now they are enchants.. And for those people saying engineering is not made for PVP, what do you think its for? We do not make any gold, all we get is fun gadgets that give you a &gt;&gt;&gt;small&lt;&lt;&lt; edge in combat and sometimes backfire and make you own yourself. If you think this is unfair then reroll engineering.. no one is forcing you to be another profession.</div></div><hr />
