Legion Website - Pre-Purchase Testing<br />
The Legion website was updated to add a Pre-Purchase button today, linking to a Battle.Net Shop page for Legion Digital Deluxe. The shop page gave an error rather than product information and the Pre-Purchase button was removed about an hour later, so it looks like it was only testing. <br />
<br />
Digital deluxe details haven't been announced yet, but we can look at Warlords Digital Deluxe (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3828-Warlords-of-Draenor-Pre-Order-and-Level-90-Boosts-Now-Available) as an example. We know Collector's Edition will get the Illidari Felstalker mount (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/5125-Legion-CE-Mount-Illidari-Felstalker-Darkmoon-Faire-Updates-Blue-Tweets-DLC-503) and the similar looking pet: Nibbles (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/95841-nibbles).<br />

Upcoming Patches<br />
No. We aren't skipping ahead. We'd like to make sure we have time to test and make sure any improvements we make (especially on the engineering end) work well. This is a very complex game with complex systems no matter how simple they may seem. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure anyone should be 'suffering' through anything. If you're not enjoying yourself with something, perhaps others can direct you toward something in game you can enjoy. I can understand wanting to get to the next new thing. It's always exciting to get to experience something completely new, but new takes time. 6.2.3 will have some nice additions and changes (as we've already announced) so hopefully you'll get something out of it when it releases. Feel free to test things out on the PTR too.<br />
<br />
Why can't we get a blue post on relevant things? I would love to hear some real reasons for why WoD patches were trash and not the time old excuse that &quot;it just didn't work out&quot; And there is nothing new here...Just reworked systems and bosses from other expansions<br />
You're not really asking a question. You want us to agree &quot;x was trash.&quot; We're just not going to do that. We do however try to make sure we're taking feedback and game experiences (on many fronts) to note so that we can continue to find ways to improve on the game.<br />
<br />
We're not always going to agree on what that means, but we'll keep trying to find ways to give people fun experiences within the game.<br />
<br />
We've seen a lot of these, &quot;just admit&quot; posts. They're not questions. They're statements of opinion that we take note of, just like we take note of those that say, &quot;we are enjoying x.&quot; We do our best to keep learning and growing whether you believe it's the 'right path' or not is just a matter of preference. That doesn't stop our bid to do better where we can as a goal for the overall health of the game.

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
&quot;What games have you played for a long time that didn't recycle or reuse levels, dungeons, etc.?&quot; My favorite kind of way to reuse a level is when you cannot complete the level because you’re missing an upgrade that you will acquire later, like Super Metroid did so well.‎ <br />
That works for Metroid almost out of tradition, but it can be really annoying if done poorly. &quot;Come back here in 30 hours when you have the ladder to reach this shortish ledge!&quot;<br />
<br />
By the way, the most common answers I got for that question (which I originally posed on twitter at ‎@occupygstreet):<br />
-- Lots of difficulty levels so you keep running the same content over and over... kind of.<br />
-- Procedurally generated content (e.g. random maps or monsters).<br />
-- Player generated content through a robust tool system. <br />
<br />
Are the skills required for cooperation in LoL, or maybe those in WoW, useful in the 'real world'? That is, winning in arenas in WoW might still require knowing good players who will group with you, but once a match has started, cooperation is just mechanical, not social. In LoL, random matching<br />
The skills that are most applicable are making quick judgment calls with limited time and information, getting people (total strangers even) to see your point of view and rally around a strategy, keeping morale up in the face of tough news, and communicating succinctly.<br />
I have interviewed and hired people because their experience leading e.g. a large raiding guild spoke of their leadership potential. <br />

Watch the WoW Arena World Championship During BlizzCon Opening Week<br />
This weekend, the final battles of the World of Warcraft Arena World Championship get underway at BlizzCon Opening Week (http://eu.battle.net/blizzcon/en/blog/19893626/blizzcon-opening-week-october-28-to-november-1-9-17-2015). We've gathered eight of the best teams from around the world who will fight for their share of a $250,000 prize pool and the title of BlizzCon 2015 Arena champions.<br />
<br />
The Opening Week action begins at 1:30 p.m. PDT on Friday, October 30, and continues at that same time on Saturday, October 31. Be sure to tune in to our free live stream on the official BlizzCon website (http://eu.battle.net/blizzcon/en/esports/wow/).<br />
<br />
Of the eight teams competing at Opening Week, only six will advance to play at BlizzCon 2015 the following week. Let's take a closer look at each of our competitors:<br />
<br />
SK Gaming – Europe<br />
SK Gaming (formerly known as Solari Gaming Blue) took first place at the European Road to BlizzCon event in an epic 5-game series against Skill Capped EU. Their presence at BlizzCon 2015 should come as no surprise, as all of these players have repeatedly proven themselves to be among the best of the best in the World of Warcraft Arena. <br />
<br />
Skill Capped EU – Europe<br />
Although they were defeated by SK Gaming in the Grand Finals at the European Road to BlizzCon, Skill Capped EU (formerly known as Solari Gaming Red) had a tremendous run throughout the tournament. Now, with Opening Week on the horizon, this team is looking to come back swinging and take the championship title at BlizzCon 2015.<br />
<br />
Solari Gaming – Europe<br />
Solari Gaming is quite possibly the team with the most to prove in this year's WoW Arena World Championship. At the European Road to BlizzCon (under the name Solari Gaming Yellow) they faced off against Three Languages One Team for the third and final spot at BlizzCon . . . and lost. However, they caught a lucky break after Three Languages One Team was unable to travel to BlizzCon. How will Solari Gaming Yellow make use of their second chance at glory?<br />
<br />
Cloud9 – North America<br />
This team qualified for BlizzCon 2015 under the name Juveniles—and with less major tournament experience than several of the other teams, and only three members on their roster, many considered them to be the underdogs. However, after taking first place at the Americas Regionals, that all changed, as Cloud9 proved themselves as one of the strongest RMDs (Rogue/Mage/Druid combo) in the world.<br />
<br />
Tempo Storm – North America<br />
It should be no surprise to see these guys at BlizzCon. Elite, Pikaboo, and Jahmilli have repeatedly shown to be one of the strongest teams in online tournaments over the past couple of years, and with Starship filling out their roster, they were nearly unstoppable at the Americas Regionals. Now Tempo Storm is out to prove that they have what it takes to be the BlizzCon 2015 champions.<br />
<br />
FollowEsports.com – North America<br />
FollowEsports.com's path to BlizzCon 2015 was rocky at best. They were the last of the six North American teams to qualify for the Americas Regionals, where they came in third place, narrowly beating out Luminosity. However, they've proven time and again that they can’t be kept down. Will this be their time to shine?<br />
<br />
Do It For Fun – Korea<br />
Yeonyeon and Coding competed as members of team Push Push at BlizzCon 2014 and fought their way past some incredibly strong competitors to advance to the semifinals. Now, with Jyottu and Mudyane joining them, Do It For Fun is here for another shot at that first place prize and the title of BlizzCon champions.<br />
<br />
Original Gangstarr – China<br />
Original Gangstarr is composed of an all-star lineup from China. XaioJie, Han BaiChuan, and Darkarchonyo have all qualified for BlizzCon before, and YiYang won the Chinese championship in 2014. Although they may not be as well-known as some of the other teams, these players should absolutely not be underestimated.<br />
<br />
Prize Pool<br />
This year's Arena World Championship features an epic $250,000 prize pool, which will distributed to each team based on their standings as follows:<br />
<br />
1st place team: $120,000<br />
2nd place team: $50,000<br />
3rd–4th: $20,000<br />
5th–6th: $12,000<br />
7th–8th: $8,000<br />
<br />
<br />
Commentators &amp; Analysts<br />
We'll be joined once again by our seasoned lineup of shoutcasters and analysts:<br />
<br />
Sid 'Supatease' Compston<br />
Elliott 'Venruki' Venczel<br />
Jared 'vhell' Coulston<br />
Josh 'Lore' Allen<br />
Jackson 'Bajheera' Bliton<br />
<br />
<br />

they aren't going to agree that WoD was trash because no sane person would say in an official capacity, on the forum owned and operated by their employer, that their product is bad, at least not one that wanted to still have a job the next day</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if they disagree there's no reason they won't want to improve the game based on feedback. Get real. They know very well WoD was not well received, and they sure as hell won't have their CMs go out in a public forum and admit that.</div></div><hr />

They've agreed that they've made mistakes.<br />
<br />
Trying to get them to agree the expansion was 'crap' or the like is a dumb thing to do, though. Personally, they might think so. Professionally, they probably understand the need to avoid it again. It's highly unlikely any professional person would speak poorly about a product they are meant to be supporting if they want to remain employed. About the only time you'd hear them say something was bad is if they are trying to build hype for the next one. The fact they admitted 6.1 was an error of judgement should show they actually are aware, since they said that without trying to sell Legion.</div></div><hr />

This right here is key. Don't get roped into pre-purchasing yet again just for a mount you probably will be bored with after a week. Make them earn your expac $$.</div></div><hr />

Even if things were added such as Foundry and such it never actually felt like there was a patch progression until Tanaan, and even if that was decent, the last big patch is eventually going to end up being at least disliked by many just because it drags out as we await the next exp.<br />
<br />
for Legion i hope they've gone back to an actual substantial patch cycle and not try to rush out the next exp again since it clearly didn't work out this time - we might get it a bit sooner but was it worth it?</div></div><hr />

<br />
If we pretend like they have their act together for a moment - ie: they've put a lot of resources into working on legion since before 6.2 even came out and are not planning on making us wait through 12+ months of HFC like we did with SOO - then no it isn't <br />
<br />
Ideally, we will see beta in Dec, pre-launch expansion in Feb, legion in April or May. May is already pushing 11 months of 6.2.<br />
<br />
That all seems unlikely even as i type it out but it would go a long way towards restoring confidence in their WoW plans/team.</div></div><hr />

Warlords pre-order started in late March, with the actual release being mid-November. So it's not that odd.</div></div><hr />

Meh, I'm sure the plan is to announce the release date for it at Blizzcon, announce beta for it starting that day too, and announce pre-orders are starting that day too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I used to be curious, until I stopped caring. People have opinions shooting out their wazoos on just about everything. They are happy with their reasoning, I'm happy with mine which means I'll pre-purchase expansions for a game that's more or less cemented in my life. GW2 taught me a lesson when it comes to pre-purchasing games I've never played, WoW and expansions for it doesn't fall under that category though. Even with WoD being what it is, I've gotten my money's worth times 10 out of it.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you don't play multi-player games a lot, but most of them are not worth waiting to see if they're good or not. I play fighting games a lot and the first weeks are the best ones because you're thirsty for all the tech and matches you can find. Of course, you need to pre-order it. I believe it's the same for shooters and sport games: the first weeks are the weeks with the most players and people talking about the game. If you wait a lot to see if you want to jump in or not, you will miss the train and it will be too late.<br />
<br />
For WoW, I always pre-order it if I'm going to play. Sales for new expansions are rare (also usually late) and I would probably buy it anyway because I'm always coming back to this game, so I might as well pre-order it and experience launch.</div></div><hr />

1. it's never too early. It's not like Legion might not come out. <br />
2. fall? no way in hell. summer or bust (if not earlier)</div></div><hr />

<br />
For games I actually want I usually pre-order on the week before release for a clean conscience about that sort of thing and at the same time reap any possible benefit. I do not pre-order games I don't want to play when it comes out.<br />
<br />
For WoW there really isn't much of a point to doing that since you frequently &quot;benefit&quot; long before release.</div></div><hr />

A lot of it is that WoD was a pretty bad product with a loooooot of bad decisions made (storyline, setting, gutting professions, the entirety of garrisons, the abomination that was 6.1, the dearth of non-raid content...)<br />

I get that it's bad PR to own up to your mistakes, and I also get that not everybody agrees on the highs/lows of the current expac. I still feel really strongly that this game's community is thirsty for some acknowledgement that WoD had serious serious problems and some kind of commitment that they're trying/tried to address it in Legion. I don't know how a CM or rep or whatever could do that, and maybe it would just be empty words, but still, it would be nice to see. <br />

Why put your money in some one elses hands for 6 months to a year? SO they can gain interest off of it? Or invest it? Use your money yourself. Think of all the preorders they will get, lets say 500k, @ 50$ each, thats 25 million dollars, for a product they have not finished and you have not received. Interest alone on that would be close to or over a million(depending on rates) why give that to them? There is ZERO benefit to you, the consumer. ANd also, zero downside in buying day one. The game gets DLd a week or so prior to launch now'a days. <br />
<br />
You say why not, and give no real reason to do so. I give you a great reason not to.<br />

No you do not, its not as though the games sell out anymore. There was a day when copies were limited and you preordered to make sure you got yours. That is simply just not the case anymore. Physical copies are printed en-mass, publishers want every one who wants a game to be able to get it, gone are the days of there being a short supply. <br />
<br />
As for digital, there is REALLY no reason. You can buy the game on day 1 and play it (in wows case) instantly. You already have the files DLd. <br />
<br />
I keep my money in my bank until I can buy and use the advertised product. I do not give my money out early to people for them to further profit from me.</div></div><hr />

Way to ignore everything I said. I specifically said that for fighting games, that is the truth. If you don't believe me, go check SF5. Pre-orders get beta access and beta access means you get to know the system and mechanics first. Same goes for other multiplayer games. After the first few weeks, the iron is not as hot anymore.<br />
<br />
Also, while digital is always there, have you tried download a game day1 on PSN? Yea, good luck with that. :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
This &quot;pre-order is bad&quot; argument is dumb. It only works for single players game and games you're not sure if you're going to play anyway. I'm sure I will play Legion before its end, so I'm okay pre-ordering it.</div></div><hr />

Mildly disappointed once, but if it's a game I'm interested in chances are I'm going to enjoy it and i'll want to preorder it. Especially for a single player game that I don't want to get spoilers on. (or if there's a collector's edition I really want, like Rise of the Tomb Raider, you have to preorder if you actually want to get it)<br />
<br />
When it comes to WoW I know I'll always come back and I'll always be there for the first few months of an expansion so I might as well pre-order.<br />
<br />
When it comes to MMOs in general, if I'm interested in it enough to try the beta and like it, I'm also going to pre-order for no other reason than to lock in my names. I usually end up playing them enough that the purchase was worth it to me, even if I eventually stop playing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd wager that if anything the Beta would start shortly after Blizzcon as there's no way they'd risk trying to deal with starting a Beta up while so many are over at the convention center. In this case I can see them just starting the pre-order with a little bonus of 'guaranteed Beta access' and maybe even going as far as having another annual pass with said pre-order.</div></div><hr />

You beta access example is the only example that I can concede to. And only in the area of Fighting games as that extra time can result in a competitive advantage. (though how many players are on the level that they care about that)<br />
<br />
I also did read your post, I agree 100% that shooters and fighting games are best in the first weeks/month. My point still stands, there are no games that come out today that you NEED to preorder to ensure day one access. <br />
<br />
I KNOW I will be playing Legion, day one, I still have zero incentive to preorder.</div></div><hr />

That works for Metroid almost out of tradition, but it can be really annoying if done poorly. &quot;Come back here in 30 hours when you have the ladder to reach this shortish ledge!&quot;<br />
<br />
By the way, the most common answers I got for that question (which I originally posed on twitter at ‎@occupygstreet):<br />
-- Lots of difficulty levels so you keep running the same content over and over... kind of.<br />
-- Procedurally generated content (e.g. random maps or monsters).<br />
-- Player generated content through a robust tool system.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;Everquest had the majority of players not even max level when expansions came out up through PoP, IIRC.&quot;<br />

Glad to see that he is still indoctrinated to beleive that difficult group play can't provide the majority of players with enough content.</div></div><hr />

Hey man, Star Wars Galaxies was a big grind and things took forever but that doesn't mean it was a great game either**. We don't live in an everquest world any more. That game is not/was not WoW. If the answer is &quot;make things take forever and are really hard only for the ultra dedicated&quot; then forget it. That isn't the game they are trying to make and frankly, I don't think it's one that those of us who are still left playing WoW *want* to play. I definitely do not want to play a WoW where there is mostly just heroic raiding, world bosses, and massive grinding. That sounds like a game that will get everquest subscription #'s and die.<br />
<br />
More importantly though, i do not believe that kind of &quot;difficult content&quot; is possible any more with the advent of mods, youtube strats and the general amount of experience that the average MMO player has earned in the 10-15 years since everquest was at it's height. We are like jedi masters at this shit now and much like the matrix, anyone can assimilate the knowledge required to drop a raid boss in 2 minutes or less thanks to youtube. Either its simply an execution issue and will be overcome or its an actual skill issue - which will be turned into a gear/balance complaint by most players (overtuned, bat itemization, guild won't bring class x any more because class y has more utility). <br />
<br />
As for creating long lasting content, you have to look at games where you can make use of systems for that. Shadows of Mordor's nemesis system, randomly generated events like in assassin's creed, battlefields/arenas. Basically a mix of the three things he suggested. Barring that, there IS no game where you can have people playing for 6+ months without new content and keep them engaged. Not any more. Except maybe sports but that's because the whole thing is essentially one big procedurally generated system<br />
<br />
<br />
**there are many great things about SWG (interesting crafting, housing, player citites, aspects of space combat) but the actual gameplay was not one of them. Core game, Combat upgrade, and NGE, bleh.</div></div><hr />

Good to see they are adopting the Star Citizen model of game production. Hyping the game before release, selling loads of prepurchase copies and not delivering on their promises. This model has made megabucks for Star Citizen and as a ATVI shareholder I am glad to see it implemented in blizzard products.</div></div><hr />

It's not bad PR, it's just not in-line with &quot;Western&quot; business practices/expectations. You have other companies from other cultures that are more than willing to say; &quot;We're aware that for many, X was a disappointment. We hope that you'll like Y because we learned A, B, and C from consumer feedback about X.&quot;<br />
<br />
As a matter of fact, that sounds like tremendously good PR in an age where people can see right through bullshit, have a world of information at their fingers, etc.<br />
<br />
But then you consider investors, many of whom don't even play the game (or know jack-all about games) and watch how whenever &quot;delay,&quot; or &quot;disappointment&quot; or negative words come up investors suddenly shit their pants, sell their shares, and stocks plummet, and you start to understand why companies are hung by their gonads with respect to PR.<br />
<br />
In the end, it comes down to the almighty dollar.</div></div><hr />
