Scott Johnson had the opportunity to sit down with Chris Metzen (https://www.frogpants.com/blog/2018/8/9/special-interview-chris-metzen-20) and talk to him about how he is doing and the how the community treats artists they disagree with.<br />
<br />
We've recapped some of the major points below, but listen to the entire thing for context!<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; scrolling=&quot;no&quot; frameborder=&quot;no&quot; allow=&quot;autoplay&quot; src=&quot;https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/483465912&amp;color=%23ff5500&amp;auto_play=false&amp;hide_related=false&amp;show_comments=false&amp;show_user=true&amp;show_reposts=false&amp;show_teaser=true&amp;visual=true&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Whenever Metzen would draw Thrall, he would draw him a little bit more upright than other Orcs<br />
Early Blizzard played lots of Samurai Shodown 2 and Wan-fu was one of the characters. Wan-fu has a necklace of balls, which was the inspiration for Thrall's Balls. <br />
Metzen had back surgery and couldn't move around as much for four months.<br />
It's hard to watch people get attacked because their movie, comic, or game displeases some number of people out there. <br />
Metzen isn't going to attack a director publicly on the internet if he didn't like a movie, he'll just not buy a ticket to his next movie. <br />
During Diablo 3 when there was a lot of controversy over decisions, the community really raked Jay Wilson over the coals. He just happened to be the public face at the time. <br />
Metzen was very lucky, as he was a public face for many years, occasionally did or said something stupid, and the fanbase would call him out. This included things like Red Shirt Guy. He made a mistake on stage under pressure and confused two characters.<br />
Metzen always felt very embraced by the community, and was appreciative of that. The internet can turn on you quickly and it would be hard to re-establish trust. <br />
What if you wanted to be an artist, filmmaker, or make games, but you grew up with an internet that literally stoned people that displeased them. What kind of incentive is that for a young person with imagination right now?<br />
There is sometimes an appalling lack of empathy for the artists that are standing up there and trying to keep the discussion going. There is a lack of empathy for that person and their heart, imagination, soul, and their spin on things. Take a step back and take a breath, everything in life isn't going to please you.<br />
If you didn't like something, such as the Last Jedi, take the opportunity to introduce someone to an expression of Star Wars that you love. Take the opportunity to engage positively. Pay forward elements of the franchise you loved.<br />
Christie Golden being attacked was embarrassing to Metzen on behalf of the community. Christie is an important voice on the Story and Franchise Development group at Blizzard and helps the game developers expand the story of the game. <br />
Metzen tried to hire Christie Golden for years, as she is an amazing voice and storyteller. <br />
The attacks on her were not only misplaced, but unfair and unjust. <br />
The last Warcraft thing that Metzen worked on was the BlizzCon 2017 Battle for Azeroth cinematic. They started on it over two and a half years ago. <br />
Every expansion people complain and lose their minds, complaining that everything sucks and the game is ruined. Then a couple months later, we are into the expansion and the tone has shifted to &quot;This is the most Warcraft it's been ever&quot;. Let the story play out. <br />
Have some empathy for the artists that are giving you everything they've got. You may not agree with every decision they make, but they are people too.<br />
Metzen isn't interested in going back to a regular job, such as a Creative Lead, anytime soon. <br />
Metzen had the chance to do a voice for an upcoming animated show recently. It was a very limited part, but it was fun to get back in the studio. It was nice to be part of something creative that didn't rest on him.<br />
If Metzen comes out of retirement to do something big, he wants to build a show that people love. An adventure that fires the imagination and heart, about people growing up together and finding themselves together in the midst of really high octane geeky stuff. <br />
Some of the things that used to drive Metzen crazy while he was at Blizzard he now has a fondness for after looking back at them. <br />
Metzen feels much better than he did two years ago in his last interview. Stepping away from Blizzard worked.<br />
Remember that empathy is important, especially in today's climate. Things are tense and there is a lot of hate out there, so to find that same kind of binary aggressiveness in our hallowed nerdy halls is disconcerting. We are supposed to dream the big dreams of a fantasy of a better tomorrow and being better people. <br />
We are all in it together, be good to each other. <br />

A lot can be said about the empathy part and other humans. Been a real lack of it in recent years.<br />

It’s not the community it’s the general climate that is on the internet right now. It is extremely toxic and I’ve never felt it has been like this before and I’ve been on the internet for like 20 years or so. There is this thing going on that you get swarmed by people as soon as someone dislike what you say or do. It is pretty terrifying if you think about it.</div></div><hr />

It's not wrong, but I don't think he'd come back to his previous position. It'd be neat to have him on as like a part-time helper or something, though.</div></div><hr />

He talked about Jay Wilson being the face of D3, well guess what on launch it was horrible and missing a shit load of stuff... at that point the person who is the face, gets raked over the coals and rightfully so. The Christie Golden situation is complicated... they told us the war would be morally grey... but at this point they are lying and i cant possibly see a logical reason for both sides to work together to fight a greater evil. How in all hells can anyone trust the horde that has not once, but twice gone with a leader who is crazy and killing everyone. They cant or wont stand up to monsters so how can we trust them anymore? Its not just that though... they have thoroughly destroyed the lore of so many characters. Tyrande abandoning her people for Malfurion and just giving up when she was willing to lose him to protect the temple of elune literally the last expansion. She is a story writers, she has to understand the concept of consistency and yet... the lore is worse than its ever been and the logical writing is even worse. Like seriously, catapults that can launch over an entire landmass, horde not doing shit about Sylvanas using the blight, following another mass murdering psychopath... Dont get me wrong, I am willing to give praise when its deserved, but so far this entire start of the xpac, of which Golden has been involved with, has been absolutely horrible in regards to story and lore and doesnt set the tone for what they said it would. She deserves to get shit, but she doesnt deserve death threats.</div></div><hr />

There's a massive difference between offering feedback and attacking people. Or attacking a game in general. Devs tend to respond a lot better to reasoned and thought out critique than they do some of the awful things I've seen flung at various games and dev teams.<br />
<br />
These people are human, and they deserve to be treated well, regardless of one's opinion of a video game. That's the point that Metzen is trying to make.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Abysthor</div><div class="date">2018-08-10, 09:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I hope some people take this to heart. I too have become embarrassed for the community. Every little thing that goes into this game gets over analyzed, people bandwagon together, and then comes the attacks and memes. Its like people just enjoy complaining together and complementing themselves over how much better they could do it. But really its all just arrogant, ignorant, and petty. Relax people. Learn to enjoy things. Or don't and just move on instead of trying to tear everything and everyone down.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that War of Thorns was story boarded out and all that prior to Golden getting hired right? She wrote the lead up book yes, but she didn't have a hand in the Warbringers shorts or Old Soldier.</div></div><hr />

I agree, the WoW community is worse then ever before but so are other places on the internet. You should watch the movie idiocracy sometime, it's a comedy from 2006 but it explains perfectly why the world is heading in this direction.</div></div><hr />

But it's not gonna be the community taking the first step towards that ever. It's gonna have to be developers first or it will never happen. Stop rehashing art, stop making lazy development decisions, stop nerfing over performing classes to balance, buff underperforming classes to balance. The developers have to put forth the effort if they want this type of reward. This community didn't start off like this. It developed through years of mistreatment through the game.</div></div><hr />

People give feedback though. Every alpha, every beta, feedback is given and outright ignored since Wrath (when, ironically, they listened too much to some classes). Only bug reports hold interest. Eventually when you treat your fans like apes some of them will start acting like apes. I can't condone harrassing devs and such, but I can't sit here and pretend they are blameless in this either. As for the lore, its an absolute dumpster fire. I am sure Christie tried to do her best, but either she has no idea what kind of behaviors would be consistant with the characters shes writing or more likely blizz boxed her in with no way out, or perhaps didn't even have anything to do with the war of thornes.</div></div><hr />

It amazes me that some people cannot understand that nerfing 2 classes to bring them on par with 10, is the exact same as just buffing the 10, also the community is exactly as it has always been, with small changess that follows the overall trend of the internet.<br />
It is also not the whole community in anyway that is part of the problem, many can easily look at the current story and understand that maybe we don't have all the pieces yet, and even if we do, we don't start yelling at the story tellers.

Respectfully that's not necessarily true. From a PvP perspective it is. But if you have 10 people in a raid and nerf the top two to bring their performance in line, unless you re-tune the raid you've made players as a group undertuned in comparison to where they were supposed to be.</div></div><hr />

Yeah man, always someone elses fault. How about taking responsability and stop acting like a douchebag just because your class isn't as fun as you thought it was before, or because your favorite character is going down a path that you dont like?<br />
Make your own game, then you can write the story however you want.<br />
<br />
It's sick that people get so upset over minor things that it's absurd.<br />

I love metzen, always have, and I've enjoyed goldens work, she brought me into not just a deeper understanding of warcraft lore, but painted for me my favorite aspects of warcraft lore, the orcs and their redemption arch. <br />
<br />
But despite the fact I love metzen and goldens writing back then, it doesn't excuse these current events as mistakes. People screw up and make mistakes, writing can get bad, writers can make bad decisions and stir the story in a bad direction, and people who are deep fans of something can become disheartened with the writers because of this.<br />
<br />
Yet in such a job as being a writer, if you don't have thick skin to handle criticism, you shouldn't be in it. In something like an ongoing drama like this, when you come on board as a writer, its up to you to keep fans happy in what they want, and if you fail to do so, if the structure of the ongoing series fails because of your mistakes, then YOU become the target, not the overarching story. <br />
<br />
I've seen this in comic books all the time. Spiderman is a beloved character and having his ongoing series for decades, but over the years they have had some awful writers coming along and fucking up the spiderman lore (examples the backing ironman in civil war, One More Day, Hitting mary jane), all from writers who didn't get what people loved about spiderman, trying to put their own spin on him, but ultimately just putting a stain on his reputation as a character in the comics.<br />
<br />
And thats what we are seeing here in warcrafts current writing, its putting a stain on the lore in different ways. I've never liked sylvanas, but I at least respected her somewhat as a dark leader who did fight beside the horde, yet now thats all gone because of how much of a cartoon supervillain she's become. After everything with Garrosh, you'd think the other horde leaders would have instantly turned on sylvanas for her request to purge the night elves from kalimdor, but they said nothing. They didn't even show anyone reacting negativly to the trees burning until the cinematic was released after the events. All this painted characters in a way people hated. <br />
<br />
And they keep babying the fanbase, looking down on them telling them 'oh, wait a little longer, your see, your see!', we're not fucking children blizzard, we're seen some awful mistakes in your lore over the years so we have a justified reason to be concerned and not take your word for it when it gets this bad. <br />
<br />
As it stands right now, if this level of disregard for the fanbases feelings on this is so cast aside, then its no wonder their even more pissed off at the writers and developers, and now having the companys ex figurehead telling the community they shouldn't be so mean to writers. <br />
<br />
Sorry Chris, I love yah, but if you want the fanbase to settle down, maybe look at the problem itself that caused it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same thing apply to your reasoning: Not necessarily true.<br />
<br />
Unless the raid was balanced around those two doing that dps (and actually with people only playing those two classes because of that), then yes, you would need to re-balance it.<br />
<br />
But the truth is that this is hardly true and they just didn't pay attention (by mistake, &quot;dev pride&quot; or lazyness to name a few reasons) to those two outperforming and doing much more than they prepared the content for. <br />
<br />
We've seen that plenty of times over the story of WoW raid and world 1st races. Like &quot;wow! check out the druid bleed damage! It's insane... STACK DRUIDS!&quot;. That raid was never balanced around that insane bleed damage (and of course not for druid stacking).<br />
<br />
Never forget that not only they nerf the top two bringing their performance in line with the other 10, but they also buff those two instead of nerfing 10 when the oposite happens (like it did happen at the begining of Legion).</div></div><hr />

There was more than one threat to her, and there were death threats also. She also DID explicitly say she was not involved in this specific thing.<br />

Also, this was very hard to read. If English is not your first language, completely ok. Otherwise, ya.<br />

So after reading his interview highlights I came here to see people attacking artists for no reason other than they don't agree with the story...was not disappointed. And you don't need to go to twitter to see the vile people spit at artists, just look at these forums.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">VanishO2</div><div class="date">2018-08-10, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">There's a massive difference between offering feedback and attacking people. Or attacking a game in general. Devs tend to respond a lot better to reasoned and thought out critique than they do some of the awful things I've seen flung at various games and dev teams.<br />
<br />
These people are human, and they deserve to be treated well, regardless of one's opinion of a video game. That's the point that Metzen is trying to make.<br />
<br />
Yes, they are human, and that's why they also make mistakes and don't always respond &quot;a lot better&quot; despite receiving reasoned and thought out critique. They also have their pride in their work (which some call dev pride) to the point where even with a huge mistake being made, they don't fix it because they think that their choice was good and the public are not good enough to realize it. From story implementation (like the current &quot;outside the game only&quot; full story) to game systems (like WoD garrisons) and class designs (like the recent class fantasy rework in Legion that had problems since alpha, but devs decided that they were right and the feedback was wrong, leading to inumerous changes/reverts after launch and during the entire expansion).<br />
<br />
Some players that were hired to work directly with the devs to help with that critique, had to dealt with it and some decided to just leave because of that (since some devs would treat them badly because these devs would take the critique as a personal attack to their skills as devs). It's &quot;normal&quot;, blizzard employees are human and they do that without it being a reaction to someone else.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yeah, the wow community has always had that shit to it, people and people, and gamers are some of the worst people online sometimes in packs. but years before it at least felt like things gelled together, the community did listen and talk to the devs/mods. <br />
<br />
These days, it just doesn't feel like it has that connection between the devs and players anymore. The problem this creates is the devs now are riding purely on their own sense of self, that they have all the best ideas and know whats best for the game and its players, so don't come down to earth with the community to talk to them more about what would make it better. <br />
This presents the problem in that they could make something enjoyable for the players, but their running a gambit if it fails completely, the players hate it, and the devs then get pissed off because they thought they had the best ideas, and even claims the community doesn't know what it wants.</div></div><hr />

As a result of whatever number of people who couldn't trouble themselves to behave themselves online, we instead get *this* conversation, which is a stupid conversation.

I like WoW in theory. In practice, I don't think much of the game. The writing is consistently poor and uncreative. The UI is deliberately obtuse. The quests are boring Kill X Things or Click on X Sparkles on the Ground 90% of the time. Bosses tend to have very little buildup, most of which is in quest text nobody reads. The game has huge, endemic problems. But one thing the game actually has going for it is an interesting cast of characters, so when they manage to screw that up on top of all the truly disappointing flaws the game already has, it's no wonder people riot. It's human nature. That doesn't make it fine, but it does mean it's a stupid thing to complain about, since the complaining won't (can't!) actually fix anything.</div></div><hr />

But one thing the game actually has going for it is an interesting cast of characters, so when they manage to screw that up on top of all the truly disappointing flaws the game already has, it's no wonder people riot. It's human nature. That doesn't make it fine, but it does mean it's a stupid thing to complain about, since the complaining won't (can't!) actually fix anything.<br />
<br />
Wow, a reasonable voice with well thought out, non-biased arguments. You must surely be in the wrong place, not brandishing pro this or that fanboy or hater weapons. <br />

Read this person's reply and the discussion is pretty much over for anyone with half a brain. Well done!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It feels like all the RPG elements have been sucked out of the game in an effort to make it more mainstream, but WoW was never popular for being some refined game. I feel like the reason WoW was popular was sort of the same reason Runescape still exists. Your character felt moldable, it felt like, as you played, your character improved. Leveling a profession was an actual journey instead of just crafting the same item over and over again to get +10 on its level. Dual talent spec only made it feel like you really had to commit to 2 specs, but with swapping being like it is now, it feels like you're pretty much all 3 at the same time. <br />
<br />
A lot of abilities got removed as well for simply being considered &quot;bad&quot; or &quot;useless&quot;. Things like weapon skills, ammo, even ability training and ranks may have felt like a hassle, but they were part of what made the game feel larger. Something as simple as having to take a boat somewhere rather than a portal is huge in my eyes. <br />
<br />
The devs just assume complaints are always story based, but what WoW has lost is its mechanics, its gameplay, its features. It may have been clunky, things may have been annoying, but without them the game feels boring. <br />
<br />
Bring boats back at the very least. I'd rather get on a boat at a harbor with 10 fellow players than just right click a portal and look at a loading screen.</div></div><hr />

It is also not the whole community in anyway that is part of the problem, many can easily look at the current story and understand that maybe we don't have all the pieces yet, and even if we do, we don't start yelling at the story tellers. If you don't like this story, then go listen to another one, or hell, make your own.<br />
<br />
There's a subtle reason why it isn't the same (and nerfing over performing is better than buffing the rest that are just right). It's that if you buff the classes to the point of the over performers then the pve bosses will drop over and everyone is disatisfied.</div></div><hr />

Actually i think a lot of the reason was Jay Wilson saying &quot;fuck that guy&quot; to a Diablo 2 dev.<br />

You can judge a movie that you've watched, but to judge a book based on its first page is pretty ridiculous.<br />
<br />
And people need to stop assuming we need to know the rest to know we won't like it.<br />
<br />
While I agree that things have gone too far in terms of insults and not far enough in attacking the root causes of this shit story, the fact remains that at this point in time, there is quite literally nothing that could redeem Sylvanas. There were dozens, if not hundreds, of viable avenues where we could have had a fair and just war over actual problems between the Alliance and Horde - And all of them were pushed aside for this?<br />
<br />
We don't need to see the end to say the beginning has ruined any possible end there could be.<br />

That said, I'm glad Metzen is doing well, even if I don't agree with his whole point. I hope he continues to improve.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cel</div><div class="date">2018-08-11, 02:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I love metzen, always have, and I've enjoyed goldens work, she brought me into not just a deeper understanding of warcraft lore, but painted for me my favorite aspects of warcraft lore, the orcs and their redemption arch. <br />
<br />
But despite the fact I love metzen and goldens writing back then, it doesn't excuse these current events as mistakes. People screw up and make mistakes, writing can get bad, writers can make bad decisions and stir the story in a bad direction, and people who are deep fans of something can become disheartened with the writers because of this.<br />
<br />
Yet in such a job as being a writer, if you don't have thick skin to handle criticism, you shouldn't be in it. In something like an ongoing drama like this, when you come on board as a writer, its up to you to keep fans happy in what they want, and if you fail to do so, if the structure of the ongoing series fails because of your mistakes, then YOU become the target, not the overarching story. <br />
<br />
I've seen this in comic books all the time. Spiderman is a beloved character and having his ongoing series for decades, but over the years they have had some awful writers coming along and fucking up the spiderman lore (examples the backing ironman in civil war, One More Day, Hitting mary jane), all from writers who didn't get what people loved about spiderman, trying to put their own spin on him, but ultimately just putting a stain on his reputation as a character in the comics.<br />
<br />
And thats what we are seeing here in warcrafts current writing, its putting a stain on the lore in different ways. I've never liked sylvanas, but I at least respected her somewhat as a dark leader who did fight beside the horde, yet now thats all gone because of how much of a cartoon supervillain she's become. After everything with Garrosh, you'd think the other horde leaders would have instantly turned on sylvanas for her request to purge the night elves from kalimdor, but they said nothing. They didn't even show anyone reacting negativly to the trees burning until the cinematic was released after the events. All this painted characters in a way people hated. <br />
<br />
And they keep babying the fanbase, looking down on them telling them 'oh, wait a little longer, your see, your see!', we're not fucking children blizzard, we're seen some awful mistakes in your lore over the years so we have a justified reason to be concerned and not take your word for it when it gets this bad. <br />
<br />
As it stands right now, if this level of disregard for the fanbases feelings on this is so cast aside, then its no wonder their even more pissed off at the writers and developers, and now having the companys ex figurehead telling the community they shouldn't be so mean to writers. <br />
<br />
Sorry Chris, I love yah, but if you want the fanbase to settle down, maybe look at the problem itself that caused it.<br />
<br />
Just want to say, very well said.<br />
<br />
There is no excuse for childish - bordering on downright inhumane behavior. But this applies to both side of the argument. Many actual positive critiques have been completely negated because people are being so dense as to categorize every potentially outspoken comment as toxic or blind fanaticism, forgetting that we as people (if rational and mature about it) can talk about these subject critically, but without being jack holes about it.<br />
<br />
It is in my opinion, the story is in a very sorry state as far as quality writing goes. I don't have the knowledge, nor the desire to start pointing fingers, but at the same time, there is clearly gaps in quality when it comes to the story. Of course people are going to get invested in a game thats been out for like 14-15 years... People need to watch their reactions to not lose their credibility in intelligence. But there clearly is a reason for why people are lashing out, respectfully or not, in droves over the current state of the story. Its disheartening to see many of the community (and potentially the company itself, although, technically Metzen isn't speaking for them) are hiding behind a wall of &quot;People are being inappropriate, their opinion doesn't matter&quot; as if to forget how the game got to its current successful state through the communities love for it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Walkerbo</div><div class="date">2018-08-11, 03:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The interview was great but I do not think being told that &quot;artists have such passion and bleed for their art so do not be mean to them&quot; and as such they, and their art, should be some protected species and they and their art should be free of critical analysis by others is galling.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's hard to watch people get attacked because their movie, comic, or game displeases some number of people out there.<br />
When an artist presents their art to the world they must understand that all art is subjective and there is no guarantee that their art will be universally loved.<br />
Some people are extremely disappointed with the direction of WoW and that in its self shows how passionate they are and their negative responses do not equate to the artists being attacked.<br />
<br />
<br />
Metzen isn't going to attack a director publicly on the internet if he didn't like a movie, he'll just not buy a ticket to his next movie.<br />
Is this a good thing? So just quietly give up on WoW without a word, just walk away.<br />
Surely providing feedback is of benefit can only strengthen the game, or is the only valid feedback total adoration?<br />
<br />
<br />
What if you wanted to be an artist, filmmaker, or make games, but you grew up with an internet that literally stoned people that displeased them. What kind of incentive is that for a young person with imagination right now?<br />
Artists of every ilk are driven to create, if their fear of negative reactions stops them from creating and sharing their art then they have already given up.<br />
Once again art is subjective, it is unlikely that it will be universally loved.<br />
Also &quot;... an internet that literally stoned people that displeased them.&quot; hyperbole.<br />
<br />
<br />
There is sometimes an appalling lack of empathy for the artists that are standing up there and trying to keep the discussion going. There is a lack of empathy for that person and their heart, imagination, soul, and their spin on things. Take a step back and take a breath, everything in life isn't going to please you.<br />
Change the target of this statement from &quot;artist&quot; to &quot;customer&quot; and appreciate that all games live and die by players actually playing the game.<br />
Gamers are gamers regardless of what game they are playing; but without gamers WoW cannot survive.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you didn't like something, such as the Last Jedi, take the opportunity to introduce someone to an expression of Star Wars that you love. Take the opportunity to engage positively. Pay forward elements of the franchise you loved.<br />
However if I change my view of the game from something that I loved to something that I can longer support why would I be trying to get friends to engage with the game.<br />
&quot;Hey mate WoW was a fantastic game and you should play, but only up to the end of MoP, from there it dropped in the crapper&quot; is not exactly a compelling argument to make.<br />
<br />
<br />
During Diablo 3 when there was a lot of controversy over decisions, the community really raked Jay Wilson over the coals. He just happened to be the public face at the time.<br />
<br />
Metzen was very lucky, as he was a public face for many years, occasionally did or said something stupid, and the fanbase would call him out. This included things like Red Shirt Guy. He made a mistake on stage under pressure and confused two characters.<br />
Being the public face of a game means having to accept the good and bad parts of that role, it is great when things are going well but when things go wrong who are we expected to contact?<br />
Red shirt guy was not a personal attack on you or Alex, it was proof that passionate players can question and in some cases correct the experts. <br />
<br />
<br />
Christie Golden being attacked was embarrassing to Metzen on behalf of the community.<br />
<br />
The attacks on her were not only misplaced, but unfair and unjust.<br />
You do not get to be embarrassed on behalf of the community, you speak for your self just as I speak for my self.<br />
In your opinion the negative feedback was unfair and unjust, yet for others it may not be; once again the danger of being the public face for the BfA story means taking both of the praise and blame.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every expansion people complain and lose their minds, complaining that everything sucks and the game is ruined. Then a couple months later, we are into the expansion and the tone has shifted to &quot;This is the most Warcraft it's been ever&quot;. Let the story play out.<br />
Up until WoD I had blindly accepted that blizzard would always produce a quality expansion even when, in my opinion, the story or premise what not initially compelling to me.<br />
After WoD I was continually told that blizzard never promised to keep flying, even though the collectors edition came with a flying mount with the tag line <br />
&quot;Descend from the skies on the back of a black-winged Dread Raven mount&quot;; this was not the only thing about WoD that I hated but it was the most deceitful example of how much WoW had changed.<br />
As such I cannot just &quot;let the story play out&quot; as I cannot trust that every thing will be alright; whether I like/dislike the game is not for you to determine.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remember that empathy is important, especially in today's climate. Things are tense and there is a lot of hate out there, so to find that same kind of binary aggressiveness in our hallowed nerdy halls is disconcerting. We are supposed to dream the big dreams of a fantasy of a better tomorrow and being better people.<br />
People seem to forget that nightmares are dreams too.</div></div><hr />

Actually it is, and you played right into it.. Most people would go &quot;oh they are doing this or that&quot; then go okay and move on ignoring whatever it is that drew them there in the first place..

I'm also glad for him to be able to experience the game as a fan rather than a creator.<br />
<br />
I agree with a lot of what he says about having empathy towards artists and creators, because they are humans and they are putting themselves out there, which is a hard thing to do. Personal attacks, vitriol, threats, obviously these things are immature and pathetic, and they sure as hell don't make for effective or persuasive criticism.<br />
<br />
<br />
However, I do think that valid criticism is important.<br />
<br />
When they talk about The Last Jedi or Warbringers: Sylvanas, I think the you can't really deny that the creators missed the mark. If they hadn't missed the mark, the backlash wouldn't be so big. Where there's smoke, there's fire.<br />
<br />
I think that Metzen gives Rian Johnson too much credit, and Metzen admittedly says he doens't know much about Johnson. Based on Johnson's attitude in interviews and other features, I really don't think he has the zealous sort of passion for Star Wars that Metzen generously assumes he must have. This is a guy who bragged about not having a vision for the films and making things up as he went along, and bragged about being hired to direct a new trilogy without actually having any ideas in mind. A guy who lacks creative vision doesn't deserve the benefit of the doubt as creator, especially for something as beloved as Star Wars. He has a responsibility to the fans to do better than that.<br />
<br />
And when it comes to Blizzard, frankly, their track record post-Warcraft 3 hasn't inspired a ton of confidence in their storytelling. I've never expected high literature from WoW -- far from it, it's pulp fantasy through and through -- and I honestly like a lot of what they've done with the story, but they've missed the mark frequently enough that even I'm skeptical of their ability to pull off this story in a satisfying way, and I'm generally an apologist who gives creators the benefit of the doubt.<br />
<br />
Sylvanas is perhaps one of the most popular characters in the ongoing Warcraft franchise, and given Blizzard's general inability to convincingly pull off heel turns since Arthas, I think it's completely valid that this story arc is setting off red flags, and fans have every right to be angry about the direction the story of their favorite character is going.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard had consistently churned out stories that were universally acclaimed I might have a different opinion here. Obviously there's the possibiity that they have everything planned out and it will build to a satisfying finale that makes everyone happy, regardless of whether they're fans of Sylvanas or not. It's a possibility. Blizzard just hasn't earned my unwavering faith. I mean, even in the midst of this very story there are inconsistencies between media, with the game leaving out vital dialogue and details that would help to contextualize the story, and there's really no good reason for that to happen.<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously, that's no reason to personally attack someone, and certainly not to threaten them. There is a right way to level criticism. If you don't like the story and want to voice your opinion, choose your words carefully and enunciate your problems with it, make a persuasive argument. Don't just dismiss it or resurt to childish insults and threats. That sort of behavior is frankly pathetic and embarrassing.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I love what they did with Sylvanus, and I'm a huge fan of getting the two factions to actually despise each other more again. The writing seems good to me, and many people here are lying like part of the quest wasn't to save innocent night elf lives, which to be honest, I thought was a bit soft.</div></div><hr />

They are creating content for a PG13 video game title! The mere expectation of emotional maturity from a playerbase with the potential age of 13 is unreasonable. And this coming from a 50 year old grown up. THAT is embarrassing. <br />
<br />
Come back with blaming the player base after you got your game a PG16 rating. Oh wait, but then you would lose precious $$$. So you'd rather keep blaming the playerbase. Ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That is what most of the people do. This is just a game I know people who didn't like specific changes in the past and stoped paying their subs. No uproar, no crying as you call it. People have better things to do, other games to try, give a chance.<br />
<br />
For example I know a girl who loved to do WQs because she found new people there. After they destroyed the LFG system (forced typing and no auto invite) she just didn't bother with the game anymore. Luckly she didn't bought the new exp. yet because Blizzard always makes the bad changes on the last weeks so people cannot back up.<br />
<br />
I'm personaly thinking to play only one month because the legacy loot system sneak change. I was OK with the lvl10+ to activate it so that means you can farm older expansions but changing it to lvl11+ means you need to wait 4 years before you can farm them. What a joke.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I figure there are gonna be some valid criticisms out there, and the people putting those forth are generally intelligent enough to do it in an eloquent manner. What I see far more of on MMO-Champion is essentially shitposting that she's bad and should be fired - look at Arvandor's post right here. No substantive criticism, just generalisations and shit-flinging.<br />
<br />
I don't see a reason to attack the creative team for creative decisions I disagree with. I will say that I think some characters, like Saurfang or Tyrande, have been poorly handled, to put it lightly. That's not to say that the quality of the writing is bad, I just don't think they're being faithful to the established backstory of the characters.<br />
<br />
Christie Golden isn't a bad writer because you don't like the story she tells. Richard Knaak was a bad writer, one only needs to point to one of the hacky tropes, characters like Rhonin or Vereesa, to begin to demonstrate that. I hope Christie stays on, sometimes a story not going the way you want it to can set up much more interesting scenarios to explore further down the track.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How I hate it if someone says something like that. First of all he surely complains to his friends etc.. We communicate, voicing opinions(even negative ones) is a part of it. Whether the audience is small or large is just a numbers game...in the end it's still the same action. If you do it among your friends the creator will not hear about it tho...untill it hits him in the wallet. Then it's too late for a change tho(see the warcraft movie. It was not the expected huge financial success and it's likely there won't be another one soon). How does that make things better?<br />
<br />
It's a sad sign for society that we seems to get spread in two camps: Insulting trolls and people that see any type of criticism as bad and want to ban it cause they never learned to handle it. <br />
<br />
May just be me, but I prefer to get criticized and be warned before someone cuts the money I need to pay my rent and buy my food. But in the payment region where Metzen lives I guess they do not need money anymore(cause they got enough) so they rather not be criticized instead.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
People give feedback though. Every alpha, every beta, feedback is given and outright ignored since Wrath (when, ironically, they listened too much to some classes). Only bug reports hold interest. <br />
<br />
May count for english bug reports. I reported like 50 bugs in WotLK back then weeks and months before release in germany...I think every single one made it into release. Stuff like where I name was wrong in the text of a quest giver and hence you have been sent to wrong locations(back then you still had to search for quest areas etc.). That one was especially annoying cause it sent you to a char from the opposit faction in a base. That's why I remember. They just would have had to change a freaking name in a text and they didn't...until 2 weeks after release(after the complaints about this quest have been all over that region-chat for days).<br />
That's my experience with bug reports...</div></div><hr />

Sure, doxxing and &quot;stoning&quot; people on the internet isn't good, but at the same time it's bullshit that companies think and say that consumers have to either say only positive things or stfu.You are misrepresenting what he said. What he said is to critique the work for the flaws you find in it, not the human behind it. And of course this has repercussion and impacts on the artist or company behind it (since those flaws are part of their work), so it's not like they are being given a free pass. It's just that you are critiquing them on the basis of solid arguments instead of doing shitty generalizations (which are easier because people don't have to think).<br />
<br />
Saying &quot;i don't like any of his works i read because X&quot; is constructive and valid, saying &quot;he can't write X for shit&quot; is probably not logically defensible (ahve you read everything he produced ? what are the arguments ?), and saying &quot;he is shit and should be fired&quot; is an ad hominem attacks without any arguments backing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
May just be me, but I prefer to get criticizedAgain, critiquing is fine. What Metzen said is that he won't attack (ie insult/threaten) the director over it. Having healthy discussions about why you didn't like it or where you'd have liked it to go is fine and good. (it's doesn't appear in the quote you had but he does say that explicitely at some other point)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yeah, the wow community has always had that shit to it, people and people, and gamers are some of the worst people online sometimes in packs. but years before it at least felt like things gelled together, the community did listen and talk to the devs/mods. <br />
<br />
These days, it just doesn't feel like it has that connection between the devs and players anymore. The problem this creates is the devs now are riding purely on their own sense of self, that they have all the best ideas and know whats best for the game and its players, so don't come down to earth with the community to talk to them more about what would make it better. <br />
This presents the problem in that they could make something enjoyable for the players, but their running a gambit if it fails completely, the players hate it, and the devs then get pissed off because they thought they had the best ideas, and even claims the community doesn't know what it wants.<br />
<br />
No wonder the devs disconnected themselfs from the community, considering how cancer it is Everywhere nowadays. The loud mob is much louder than the people that come with good ideas and solutions.<br />
They cant say anything without being attacked in one way or the other.</div></div><hr />

If the fan base is unhappy with your crappy storytelling, don't blame the fanbase and cry bullying and &quot;nerd herd culture.&quot; It doesn't matter if your customers as a whole are valid or not in their criticisms.

Customers have the right to not consume, not to forgo any shred of human decency in their criticism. The fanbase consists of individuals, each of whom is capable of making a choice in how they express themselves. If they do so like uncivilised trolls, there is no need to engage with that imo. <br />
<br />
Jaina had a whole cinematic explaining where she got that ship. Jaina's penchant for ice magic predates Frozen's release by five years, and the ice queen character trope was popularised by a 19th century fairytale by Andersen. Teleport was a more efficient way of dealing with the situation at the end, because the building was collapsing around them. Feel about the storytelling however you want, but the points you make are feeble. I heavily dislike the skewed, warmongering logic Sylvanas puts forward in the Horde quests and the whole conflict seems based on little more than Sylvanas' hatred of everything, but the Jaina parts are absolutely fine.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, Wow is just too big, with too many creative voices and too much lore. This leads to large differences in creative vision and creates too many plot holes and inconsistencies. <br />

While I agree that things have gone too far in terms of insults and not far enough in attacking the root causes of this shit story, the fact remains that at this point in time, there is quite literally nothing that could redeem Sylvanas. There were dozens, if not hundreds, of viable avenues where we could have had a fair and just war over actual problems between the Alliance and Horde - And all of them were pushed aside for this?<br />

I say women because this country has literally turned men in a bunch of apologetic pansies. I’m glad to say that everyone who made Warcraft back in the 90’s made me a fan of this game. Warcraft was not something just thought up overnight and would not have existed if it wasn’t for Warhammer…Period. Also Starcraft another one of Blizzards franchise would not have existed without the Alien and Predator franchise. <br />
<br />
Now let me ask Chris Metzen and all these arrogant people at the top something. Let’s say you go to your favorite restaurant and order the same meal on the menu. Not only that, everyone comes to that restaurant to order the same meal. You even tell you’re your friends about how good this place is and they tell their friends. Then one day you and your friends ban together and order the same meal and all of you notice something different. They either added more salt, it wasn’t cooked the way it was supposed to be or the portion was less. You complain to the manager about it and he tells you… nobody else is complaining, you’re overacting, you are a sexist because the person who cooked it was female instead of the male who always served up the food, and you are not entitled to complain because this business is successful so go to another restaurant because the food is no longer to your liking. <br />
<br />
This shit right here is what Disneys has done to Star Wars and what Blizzard Activision is doing with World of Warcraft. You defend The Last Jedi because you know you will get a lot of slack for how shitty that Warcraft movie was. You also bash Transformers because that piece of shit series made Billions more overseas than your Warcraft movie. If you would have done a Starcraft movie probably you would have made a billion overseas. The problem with the Warcraft movie was that the thought process in making that film had no love in it. Look at the Old Soldier video. Those 6 minutes had more story and emotion than your full length feature film and every expansion to date. This Warcraft movie should have been just like this CG sequence. I would guarantee it would have blown up on the box office. The same goes for World of Warcraft and its story. The entire thing is fragmented into different types of mediums since the end of Wrath of the Lich King that when people complain about the story not making sense you put the blame on them for not reading a book. Who the hell are you people putting the blame on your customers? No, we need to be told why this is happening in game. You can’t just create an event like the burning of Teldrassil without explaining the motivation behind it. I understand if it’s 10 to 15 people who are complaining but it’s countless of players and nothing has been addressed. All this started right about the end of Wrath of the Lich King and Activision stepping in. This is where this game has been taking a nose dive from 12 million to under 5 million maybe even less now. Chris Metzen keeps hyping people up saying to be patient something cool is going to happen. But Chris it’s the opposite and not what you believe you claim you hear. People have had it with lies and deceit and they all (including me) want is play a game where there’s a great story and a motivation into playing. A story shown in the cinematic we are playing and not something completely different. The type game that once a long time ago we were rewarded completing a challenge with a group. Not for that reward to mean nothing because someone else can get something better in a world quest. <br />
<br />
As for ownership yes we own Star Wars, Warcraft, Dragonball and everything that follows a huge fan base. Japan is starting to understand this now. They are giving their fans what they want. Look at that Smash Bros video where everyone is screaming and jumping for joy. Look at Monster Hunter; look at those videos on how players act towards the man who saved the Final Fantasy MMO. Why can’t Warcraft have that effect on people like it once did? I’m still waiting for it. <br />
On behalf of the millions out there we are the ones who decide if these projects are going to be successful or not. We are the engine that puts a roof over your head, feed your families and keep you employed because we are investing our money into it. Having a vision and calling yourself an artist is pointless and just comes out as being arrogant. The truth is that you and everyone at Blizzard didn’t make this and all you’re other franchises successful. We did. We decide not you or anyone else who believes this fairy tale. So no one including Blizzard and Disney can’t decide to change things on the fly and hire a bunch of idiots like Rian Johnson who has no love for Stars Wars and be in charge of a multibillion dollar franchise because his agenda was to divide people and create a toxic environment that’s gains them publicity. He didn’t want to do a movie that was good he wanted to the movie where some mostly everyone hated and the idiots who don’t care about this franchise liked it. This was his goal and there a ton of videos of him personally say this. <br />
<br />
As for the threats to people, well I say that shit is going too far. I don’t agree with it and I believe in voicing your opinion on things you don’t like, but not in this manner.</div></div><hr />

Take the opportunity to engage positively. Pay forward elements of the franchise you loved.&quot;<br />
<br />
Sorry, Chris, but that's not a solution, and it's ain't our job. Hold the creators accountable! The fans did pay the Star Wars franchise forward for fucking decades, with the universe creation that George was part of and approved, that Kennedy tossed out when she took over. The fans did exactly what you're saying, and they got spit in the face from Kennedy and Johnson and Abrams for their efforts.<br />
<br />
Bad work is bad work. &quot;Paying it forward&quot; means being a fan, and caring, which is why the fans are fucking upset! <br />
<br />
Tired of this feel-good panacea crap to cover up for shoddy work. Johnson made a crap movie. Get over it. The criticism is valid. It's not wrong to have negative opinions! What made Star Wars - and Warcraft - a massive fucking franchise is fans giving a shit, and you're telling them to stop giving a shit? That doesn't work, Chris. You're way off base here, and way out of line. <br />
<br />
Yes, some fans are taking it too far - or, are they even fans, or just the usual 4chan shithead types taking advantage of the issue to be their usual asshole selves? Stop throwing the baby out with the bathwater here - fans are upset, but that doesn't make them &quot;toxic&quot;. This is more of the smelly bullshit a certain mod on the WOW forums was spreading, accusing players with an agenda when they were unhappy with WOD - complaints that Ion and crew apologized for and admitted to later. <br />
<br />
And, toxic is a two way street - Johnson has done himself no favors by acting childish and unprofessional on social media, to people he should be treating with respect as paying customers. <br />
<br />
I respect you as an artist, Chris, your track record is excellent and your place in creating this franchise is important and foundational, but this kind of excuse making for shitty work, and offloading the fix onto our shoulders is bullshit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, people do need to stop assuming that.<br />
<br />
There's no good way for this story to go, and I'm sure as fuck not going to pay the content creators for writing it in a way I don't like 'because what if it gets better later?!' If it gets better later, I spent a shit load of money on something I didn't like, only for it to be made mediocre later.<br />
<br />
I don't care if it gets better later. It's ruined now. There would have to be a reason I'm sticking with it right now, and there isn't, so I'm not. No, I don't have to 'support the creators' if the creators are going to shit on everything, see the fallout of that shit, and then blame those getting shit on for being upset that they're getting shit on. And after the whole &quot;Don't worry Horde! You'll have your moment!&quot; since this all came out, I sure as FUCK am not about to believe anyone at face value when they say &quot;Don't worry, it'll get better later!&quot;<br />
<br />
I'll wait for later, and IF it gets better, I MIGHT be back. That's my right as a consumer, and no, I don't feel bad that the creators might suffer a bit for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's not defending The Last Jedi or whoever worked on it though.<br />
<br />
He's saying don't just blindly attack people and form some valid criticism rather than throwing stones in one point he makes. And if you did dislike the Last Jedi then introduce friends into a different point of the Star Wars universe. Particularly a part you loved which for example for me would be the original trilogy.<br />
<br />
Shit like death threats over disliking a film or game are just petulant at best. Metzen is right on this part. Some people take it way too fucking far sometimes.<br />
<br />
Constructive criticism is fine and dandy. Threatening physical violence on the WoW devs as people have been doing over the recent story changes is just pathetic and in my opinion you aren't a WoW fan if you go that far over a game change you dislike.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hell-Nicø</div><div class="date">2018-08-12, 05:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Except... he totally did?<br />
<br />
He said the movie was really good and the dude was a huge fan that worked religiously to make a good starwars movie, when in fact the movie was really bad, full of plot hole and stuff that just contradict the SW lore, full of lefty politic propaganda, and clearly made to pissoff Starwars fans and everyone who cared about the story and where the story will go.<br />
He left the franchise in ruin by not only producing a terrible movie, but by also ruining the previous movie by shitting on each and every set up JJ put in them for some potential could stuff and by leaving NO buildup at ALL for the next movie.<br />
<br />
And once everyone called him out on that, he ATTACKED the fans, calling them unsecured man babies, sexist and racist at the drop of a hat.<br />
<br />
Sure, Metzen is right on his point about fandom and hate, but that particular example has NOTHING to do with undeserved hate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact is that the plot directly has made the game not fun to play for a large number of people (I would say &quot;unusually large&quot;) and they have a right to complain about that. And even if they don't have the most literate voices, their opinions still matter.<br />
<br />
I don't believe Blizzard hates the horde. On the other hand, I have no idea what they were thinking when they thought this direction get anything other than the reaction it did. The signs were all there.</div></div><hr />

I sent a tweet to Metzen, saying &quot;just because there are trolls in the warcraft community doesn't mean all criticism of the story/game are bad criticisms&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is really annoying because people are genuinely pissed off by these events, and have structured good arguments against the writing and direction of the story, but it gets dismissed because just a few trolls make death threats to the writers, so all criticism must thus now be ignored or dismissed.<br />
Honestly Blizzard has seemed dismissive towards their fanbase for some time in a lot of ways. Maybe they are worn out by players' antagonistic behavior, shrug. But a whole lot of players are supportive of Blizzard and that includes those who are critical of some decisions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly! Some of the criticisms come from a place of peoples continued fondness for the game and it's characters, settings, backdrops and history. People can have constructive criticism that should benefit the creative approach.<br />
<br />
But if it gets ignored because of some negative trolls shit talking or worse then it's really all the more disconnected</div></div><hr />

<br />
This post sums up where I'm at with the recent hand-waving. It is not being toxic to call something bad when it is actually bad. Obviously, death-threats or telling someone to get cancer is over the top. But criticism does NOT need to be &quot;constructive&quot; in order to be valid. Nor does calling a spade a space automatically mean it's being &quot;toxic&quot;.</div></div><hr />

More people should take this piece of advice. Instead of paying for a sub-par, mediocre product they should just spend their money and time in a better place.<br />
On the other hand it's only natural to get annoyed when you see some idiots messing up something wonderful and loved and want to be vocal about it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">volition</div><div class="date">2018-08-15, 08:52 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The same thing apply to your reasoning: Not necessarily true.<br />
<br />
Unless the raid was balanced around those two doing that dps (and actually with people only playing those two classes because of that), then yes, you would need to re-balance it.<br />
<br />
But the truth is that this is hardly true and they just didn't pay attention (by mistake, &quot;dev pride&quot; or lazyness to name a few reasons) to those two outperforming and doing much more than they prepared the content for. <br />
<br />
We've seen that plenty of times over the story of WoW raid and world 1st races. Like &quot;wow! check out the druid bleed damage! It's insane... STACK DRUIDS!&quot;. That raid was never balanced around that insane bleed damage (and of course not for druid stacking).<br />
<br />
Never forget that not only they nerf the top two bringing their performance in line with the other 10, but they also buff those two instead of nerfing 10 when the oposite happens (like it did happen at the begining of Legion).<br />
<br />
You're right. I didn't consider that. I'd like to think math is being done to estimate required damage for encounters with enrage timers. But you're right, for fights without enrage, it's probably not crucial to have the group hit a dps threshold.<br />
<br />
I don't disagree with your closing statement either, it was largely just a response to the idea that buffing the bottom performers to bring them up in line was the same as nerfing the top performers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But in certain markets, media especially, paying with your wallet doesn't really make that much noise and takes a long time to pull the attention to the industry as what is acceptable or not.<br />
<br />
Using Last Jedi as an example: 1.321 billion USD<br />
<br />
Do you think it would have made that much if people knew what they were going into? The Last Jedi was garbage, but it was already paid for. If you speak with your money on the next product (which very well may be great for all you know) not only was the message that The Last Jedi was terrible completely missed, as its years later, but the premise that it did well just because of sales is a false premise (not to mention that you are technically judging a new product you haven't experienced yet, purely based off of past experience).<br />
<br />
The Force Awakens did: 2.066 billion USD.<br />
<br />
This certainly shows that the new movies are not trending well. I personally believe The Force Awakens was pretty awful. According to 'speaking with your wallet', The Last Jedi shows this, but its clear that speaking with your wallet didn't work here as the Last Jedi received far more out-cry and dislike then The Force Awakens. With the shit show that The Last Jedi was, I'm assuming the next Starwars will be another step down (and my only curiosity is if Disney will ever learn their lesson).<br />
<br />
<br />
This doesn't all apply the same way to WoW though. as WoW is a subscription based form of entertainment, stopping your sub speaks much louder then paying for a crap movie and in turn deciding to not pay for one you haven't experienced yet.<br />
<br />
But WoW in this same regard does have the ability to 'float' so to speak on bad production (weather you see it that way or not) just due to the blind followers, the people that don't give a crap about the story but like the rest, or just use WoW as a means to community and the rest is icing...<br />
<br />
Speaking out is fine, should be encouraged, and everyone benefits from good communication (even if the message isn't about positives). We as people just need to not mix up childish behavior in that (or mistake reasonable criticisms as childish behavior).</div></div><hr />
