Cataclysm Hotfixes - Updated Dec. 13<br />
Here you will find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the release of patch 4.0.3a and World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. While many have already been deployed on all realms, some may not be implemented until the next time your realm is restarted. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied.<br />
<br />

War Games: Battleground and Arena Skirmishes<br />
Beginning with Arena Season 9, we're giving Arena and Battleground teams the option to challenge each other to War Games, a new kind of skirmish that allows teams to practice, set up matches against friends or rivals, or even try out potential recruits. We've prepared a handy FAQ to explain how it works.<br />
<br />
Q: What's a War Game?<br />
A: A War Game is an unranked match in which one group of players challenges another group to an Arena or Battleground skirmish in a setting of their choosing. You will be able to initiate a War Game by using the /wargame or /wg command, as explained below.<br />
<br />
Q: When will War Games be available?<br />
A: War Games will become available with the start of Arena Season 9. After that point, you'll be able to play a War Game at any time, regardless of whether a season is underway.<br />
<br />
Q: How does it work?<br />
A: After you've formed your group, use the /wargame or /wg command to challenge another group leader to a War Game match, like so:<br />
<br />
/wg groupleadername mapname<br />
<br />
If mapname is left blank, a random Arena or Battleground will be chosen automatically based on the initiating team's size.<br />
<br />
For example: JohnnyRaider wants to challenge TommyPvP to a 2v2 Arena skirmish in the Nagrand Arena. After each forms a separate group with his respective Arena partner, JohnnyRaider uses the following command to start the War Game:<br />
<br />
/wg tommypvp nagrand arena<br />
<br />
TommyPvP will receive a pop-up notice stating &quot;JohnnyRaider has challenged you to a War Game in the Nagrand Arena.&quot;<br />
<br />
TommyPvP then has a little over a minute to accept the challenge. Once he accepts, each group will be placed in the queue and will receive a pop-up window prompting them to enter the skirmish once it's ready.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I play War Game skirmishes against members of my own faction?<br />
A: Yes! The War Game skirmish system allows you to challenge players in your same faction to Arena and Battleground matches. You can also challenge those of the opposite faction.<br />
<br />
Q: Do I have to type the whole map name, or can I just type &quot;/wg tommypvp warsong&quot; to enter Warsong Gulch?<br />
A: You can type only part of the Arena or Battleground name, and the system will select the closest match. If you want to be safe, you can use the entire name (as below) to launch a War Game skirmish.<br />
<br />
Arenas: Blade's Edge Arena, Dalaran Sewers, Nagrand Arena, The Ring of Valor, Ruins of Lordaeron<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds: Alterac Valley, Arathi Basin, The Battle for Gilneas, Eye of the Storm, Isle of Conquest, Strand of the Ancients, Twin Peaks, Warsong Gulch<br />
<br />
Random map options: Random Battleground, All Arenas<br />
<br />
Q: Can I challenge a team from another realm to a skirmish?<br />
A: No, you can only challenge opponents on your own realm.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I start a game if one team has fewer group members than the other?<br />
A: You are able to create a Battleground War Game with uneven team sizes, but you are not able to create an Arena War Game with uneven team sizes. For example, an 8v5 Warsong Gulch War Game is possible, but launching an Arena War Game with uneven team sizes won't work.<br />
<br />
Q: What's the largest possible size for a War Game?<br />
A: Arena War Games can support up to 5v5 matches. Battleground group sizes are limited to the maximum number of participants each map normally allows.<br />
<br />
Q: Are any statistics recorded from War Game skirmishes?<br />
A: No, they work similarly to the old Arena skirmish system. Kills, damage, and healing are tracked and displayed at the end of the match, but wins and losses are not.<br />
<br />
Q: How long does it take for a War Game match to start?<br />
A: Once the challenge has been accepted, you will generally be through the queue in less than 30 seconds. War Games offer you a quick way to get into practice matches with other teams, test out potential recruits, or just have fun with your friends.<br />
<br />
Q: Can I receive achievements or guild experience in a War Game?<br />
A: Because you can pick who you play against, nothing is awarded for playing in these skirmishes -- except for the rush that comes with a hard-won victory, of course.<br />
<br />
Q: Do I get honor for killing players in a War Game Battleground?<br />
A: No. These are skirmish matches, so no honor is awarded for objectives or kills.<br />
<br />
Q: What’s the difference between the /wg command and the War Game button in the PvP interface?<br />
A: The War Game button is used only for launching Battleground matches. The /wg command covers both Battleground and Arena skirmishes. We plan to further integrate the War Game feature into the PvP interface in a future patch.<br />
<br />
Q: Why have you added this feature?<br />
A: Players have long been asking for a way to challenge specific teams, guildmates, friends, and rivals to skirmish matches in Arenas and Battlegrounds of their choosing. We hope you enjoy this new feature, and we look forward to seeing you on the battlefield!<br />
<br />

Cataclysm Shatters Sales Record<br />
IRVINE, Calif. -- December 13, 2010 -- Blizzard Entertainment, Inc. today announced that World of Warcraft®: Cataclysm™, the third expansion for the critically acclaimed massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), sold through more than 3.3 million copies as of its first 24 hours of release, making it the fastest-selling PC game of all time.* This milestone eclipses the previous record of more than 2.8 million copies sold in 24 hours, set in November 2008 by Blizzard's second World of Warcraft expansion, Wrath of the Lich King®.<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: Cataclysm was simultaneously released in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Argentina, Chile, Europe, Russia, Southeast Asia, Australia, and New Zealand on December 7, and became available in Korea and the regions of Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau on December 9. More than 10,000 stores throughout the world opened their doors at midnight to welcome players who wanted to be among the first to obtain a copy of the expansion. In addition, more than 15,000 players attended official launch events hosted by Blizzard and key retail partners in the US, Canada, France, Germany, Russia, Sweden, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, and the region of Taiwan.<br />
<br />
&quot;We had to bring Azeroth to the brink of destruction in Cataclysm, but the result was our best expansion yet,&quot; said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. &quot;We want to thank all of our new, existing, and returning players throughout the world for their incredible enthusiasm and support, and we look forward to hearing what they think about all the new content.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;World of Warcraft: Cataclysm delivered even bigger day-one sales than we experienced with StarCraft® II: Wings of Liberty™ in July,&quot; said Bob McKenzie, senior vice president of merchandising at GameStop, &quot;making this a record year for Blizzard Entertainment at GameStop.&quot;<br />
<br />
Prior to the launch of Cataclysm, World of Warcraft's subscriber population had grown to more than 12 million players globally, further strengthening the game's position as the world's most popular subscription-based MMORPG. More information about the new expansion can be found at the official Cataclysm website: http://www.blizzard.com/games/cataclysm/.<br />
<br />
To keep pace with the continued growth of World of Warcraft as well as development on other Blizzard Entertainment® games, the company is currently hiring for numerous open positions. More information on career opportunities available at Blizzard Entertainment can be found at www.blizzard.com/jobs.<br />

Dalaran/Shattrath Portals<br />
We have no plans to return the portals to Shattrath and Dalaran. Please refrain from creating further such threads on this topic. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/142903/bring-back-portals-in-shattrah-dalaran))<br />
<br />
Healing in Cataclysm<br />
It's definitely challenging to heal in Cataclysm and that's by design. We want players to pick and choose what spells to use and when. Those in your group will also need to be conscious of whether or not they're putting out enough DPS, taking too much damage, and more. You'll probably be pulling out more &quot;tricks&quot; from your bag than you've been doing in awhile. You're also going to miss a time or two, run out of mana at a bad time and find yourself trying to figure out just what went wrong. Even experienced healers are going to have to dig their heels in a bit.<br />
<br />
That said, we're keeping an eye out for how healing is going and should we feel there need to be adjustments, we'll make them. As many have noticed, we're starting to get a larger population of level 85 players who will be running through the content and getting better gear to compliment their spells and abilities. That should help some. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/142922/healers-taking-the-brunt-of-the-cataclysm))<br />

Athene was banned in WotLK, because they were exploiting 5 mans (as well as a bug that caused respawns indefinitely if I remember correctly). The person who actually got World First at that time used the same technique Athene did this time, but since it was outside of instances Blizz allowed it.</div></div><hr />

well actually those sales figures aren't that impressive when you look at percentages vs raw numbers...despite having somewhere between 1.5 and 3 million more subscribers at the launch of Cata as opposed to the launch of wrath they only sold 1/2 million more copies of the game which means a greater % of the player base didn't upgrade their accounts (which is never a good thing). Those numbers also raise questions into how blizzard counts subscribers because I'm a little hard pressed to believe that 2/3 of active subscribers (I'm reducing that from 75% to 66 % to account for the fact China doesn't have Cata) are still playing Wrath.</div></div><hr />

Well mate, there's only minority of WoW gamers who buy the game on the day, remember it's Xmas time so a lot of players wants it for Xmas instead of buying it themselves. But I would still say that 3.3 million people who bought the game within 24 hours is quite an achievement because then one can only wonder how many then bought it within it's first week.</div></div><hr />

True, but this expansion is a little different. You don't actually NEED to upgrade to enjoy it. I didn't upgrade to Cataclysm until a few days after release. There are plenty of people who are also waiting for Christmas or for finals to end before picking up the expansion.</div></div><hr />

Really? I thought they'd lower it if anything. I've gotten well over 300 of these from casual herbing while leveling, and I'm only 83 on my herber.

As for those crying foul over it: oh shut up, stop pretending that Athene achieved a damn thing, instead his guild levelled for him while he casually sat back and tagged mobs. This could of course easily have been fixed by blizzard implementing &quot;xp awarded for dmg done&quot; instead of &quot;full xp if you did the first 1 dmg&quot;, but its not like first 85 is regarded as important enough to change things, but if that fix had been in, the person who would have gotten it would likely have been whoever got lucky enough to be let in first :P</div></div><hr />

You're wrong. It is their fault. I was one of beta testers and at no point was Tol Barad actually testable. There were constantly game breaking bugs preventing it to be. There was no 1:1 queue until the end of beta so it was impossible to have proper battles at any point. Also they didn't have npcs guarding the spawn point of attackers so the attackers constantly got camped at spawn. There were some other game breaking bugs related to how capping nodes and spawning works which I don't remember anymore, but yeah, even with all this, plenty of players on forums still could predict and tell that the battle is gonna favor the defenders. Blizzard didn't have a single reply on it.</div></div><hr />

It is possible to complete that, but just after numerous tries and failed attempts..<br />
<br />
Seems like the submarine script breaks when there are multiple passengers in the sub.<br />
<br />
When I finally completed this quest I used the scope on the sides. After that, the NPCs started talking. When the fight was over, Nazgrim despawned and the fight started again as if nothing ever happened. I swam back to the cavern and then returned to the rift. Suddenly Nazgrim was there and I could complete the quest. You may also try this :)</div></div><hr />

Wha scope? :)<br />

Congrats on missing the point. After each one of you hits 85 the guild leveling slows down to a complete crawl. You would need the equivalent XP from leveling 80-85 and keep that leveling pace for around 130 days to hit the theoretical cap.</div></div><hr />

I am pretty sure it is not bugged. Because you also get tons of Earthen Ring rep in Deepholm. I think, since Vashj'ir is some Earthen Ring and some of your faction, there is not much Rep. But once you get to Deepholm then you will be easily into Honored with the Earthen Ring. That is where their rep really comes from.

Because you also get tons of Earthen Ring rep in Deepholm. I think, since Vashj'ir is some Earthen Ring and some of your faction, there is not much Rep. But once you get to Deepholm then you will be easily into Honored with the Earthen Ring. That is where their rep really comes from. I think the Vashj'ir Earthen Ring rep is working as expected.<br />
<br />
this isn't true. Some character get to Revered while questing through Vash, some barely to friendly. I believe it is also only a horde issue, and also related to guild rep or exp.<br />
<br />
There have been numerous threads about it on the forums. I wish Blizzard would just acknowledge it. I stopped questing in Vash at about 50/150 (510 neutral). My concern is that they won't be able to retro the rep, and I won't be able to get to friendly and by the tabard.</div></div><hr />

And seriously, are poelpe still QQing about portals. As far as I know there is a portal to and from every single new zone. There's the ring that ports you to Dalaran, there is the tabard that ports you to Argent Tournament, and there are boots (gl fishing derby) that port you to Booty Bay. There is no need for portals anymore. Flying from SW bank to portal area..... 10-15 seconds. Flying from the farthest edge of say Deepholm to the center, maybe 30 seconds. Oh no!

I did the entire Vashj'ir zone on two characters now and I have never seen a portal back to Orgrimmar. The same goes for Hyjal and Uldum. The only two zones with portals back to Orgrimmar/Stormwind are Deepholme and Twilight Highlands as far as I know.<br />
<br />
Hyjal isn't bad for Horde, as it is a short flight to and from Orgrimmar. I know this because the Hyjal portal is bugged for Horde and we don't get the Org-&gt;Hyjal portal until we get the Twilight Highlands portal.</div></div><hr />

Agree with the others, these are day 1 sales, not total sales. Last week and this week are finals for many universities, as well as everyone who will be getting the game for Christmas.

Blizz seems to depend upon unpaid beta testers to do their QA... Because, like it all the other bullsh!t they pull, they know the userbase tolerates it.<br />
<br />
There is no reason why new content, patches, etc., couldn't be properly tested. Out in the real world, there are very mature methodologies for testing massive real-time systems... And WoW is just another one of those. Of course, in the real world when scheduled maintenance that was supposed to end at 11AM gets pushed back hour-by-hour to 5PM the the people responsible don't get to put up a &quot;thank you for your patience&quot; message... They get fired. Within Blizzard, there's every reason to believe that the bean-counters have decided that it's more profitable to annoy players than pay what it would cost to properly test. And you can't fire QA staff that doesn't exist, can you?<br />
<br />
Actually, given the environment they deal with, I think the Blizz staff does as well as could be expected. It's just like so many other large corporations that are ruled by the short-term bottom-line thinking of bean-counters and lawyers... you have a bunch of not-very-well-paid, not-particularly-bright, not-effectively-motivated folks, muddling along in bureaucratically-enforced mediocrity.</div></div><hr />

He admitted in his video that it was the group that did it for him. So stop trying to act like he's claiming it was all done by himself, when he's never said it was.<br />
<br />
I'm not an Athene fanboy at all. The first &quot;Athene Wins&quot; video I saw on YouTube I thought was hilarious, but then when more videos were coming out, and Tanya got her out channel, and all this other stuff, he was just another YouTube guy that I don't tend to pay too much attention to. The guy knows how to do things, and he has enough credibility in the game where he has the trust of people to help him get things done.<br />
<br />
He's an internet celebrity, and therefor there will always be people out there willing to do stuff for him. Hell, take TotalBiscuit for example. He probably has all sorts of people making Trolls to join his guild, just because the guy has a little presence on the internet himself.<br />
<br />
So while you sit there and say &quot;nobody cares&quot; or &quot;it is meaningless&quot;, well you would be wrong. Some people out there do care who gets world, continent, battlegroup, server and whatever else firsts..and to them it does have meaning. Trying to ridicule those people however shows that you are a hypocrite. You care about what happens in WoW, not as much as others possibly, but there is a reason you come to MMO-Champion to get information on the game..and it's because you do care to some extent.<br />

As for those crying foul over it: oh shut up, stop pretending that Athene achieved a damn thing, instead his guild levelled for him while he casually sat back and tagged mobs. This could of course easily have been fixed by blizzard implementing &quot;xp awarded for dmg done&quot; instead of &quot;full xp if you did the first 1 dmg&quot;, but its not like first 85 is regarded as important enough to change things, but if that fix had been in, the person who would have gotten it would likely have been whoever got lucky enough to be let in first :P<br />
<br />
Good idea in theory only. Burst classes and better geared players could swoop in and steal xp from lower lvl or geared players. And ganking would be taken to a new lvl. Not only from opposite faaction but by allies that don't like you.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they are stupid. It will just take a few patches of tweaking things to try to find the sweet spot. If they made tanking too easy, then groups would fall back in to the boring AoE grindfest WotLK mentality. Same for healers, because if healers had mana bars that barely moved, then that would allow the tanks and DPS'ers to do boneheaded things and survive relatively unscathed.<br />
<br />
I have no doubts we are experiencing a tank shortage again because of the increased difficulty of dungeons/heroics and tanking, because queues are almost always 30+ minutes and often 40+ minutes.<br />
<br />
I don't envy them for trying to find ways to entice people to tank, but without making content a joke so that it is boring and unrewarding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This could not be farther from the truth. In the world of software development, Beta testers account for the least amount of bug/defect discovery. Every development team is first and foremost responsible for testing their code before anyone else sees it. From there it is released to an internal test team(s), these teams are supposed to find the majority of the bugs/defects, it literally is their job. After that, most companies release their code to other departments within the same company to use and test (sometimes this extends to trusted business partners, friends of the company etc). Finally, the code is released to Beta testers, solely because they may think of trying something in a way that noone else thought of. In the development community, it is generally assumed that developers will catch some 10-30% of their own bugs/defects, internal testers 70-90% and beta testers 1-2% (yes, I am aware the numbers don't add up, but that's how it's said in the industry). Blaming any problems with a game on Beta testers is a very sad cop-out and wouldn't be tolerated at any company I have worked at. While the majority of WoW Beta testers probably aren't living up to their real expectations, it really isn't their job to balance the game either.<br />

<br />
No one said anyone else had to get any experience at all. Just a proportional reduction to the tagger as a way to curtail world power-leveling. Sure that might still encourage more ganking or harassment too (crimping someone elses' exp gain might be motivation enough for some), but the motivation of getting the rest of those experience points would not exist. Complaints about people harassing you would be pretty easy to substantiate with an in-game recording of the behavior, resulting in suspensions and bans for those that take it too far. <br />
<br />
Players would still power-level their alts by dragging them through lower-level instances with a high-level guildie or a 2-boxed second account, just like they always have.<br />

If they lost more customer base due to QA issues, the bean counters would notice and philosophies might change. Until then, spending more resources on additional QA is less valuable than using those resources in other areas. Compared to how bad things were in the 1.X and 2.X era of WoW, today's maintenance levels are consitently excellent.</div></div><hr />

Getting 2 million or more people to do anything (@ $40 each) the first day that they can is *always* impressive. By way of comparison, movie makers are doing cartwheels if they can get 2 million people (of a much much wider possible audience than WoW subscribers) to plop down their $10+ each on opening day. Your position only holds water if the Cata adoption % is low a few weeks after the launch, particularly after the massive gift-giving holidays coming up (Chanukah, Christmas, Boxing Day, etc).</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only place this is ever really an issue is when people are in a rush to get to the level cap. Would those same people that helped someone get to 85 do that at any other time of the game? I can't really think of a reason to do so. So we're talking about something that is going to happen 1 day out of every 1 1/2-2 years. It's not really worth their time to account for this situation. In the end it really provides very little benefit to the players anyway.<br />
<br />
On the other hand I don't see how this change could encourage ganking. If someone really wants to hurt the XP gain of lower level player, they can do that today. Just follow the player around and kill every mob before they get to it. That is the same level of harassment as the lower level player not getting any XP gain. I haven't ever seen that kind of behavior before.</div></div><hr />

Isn't Athene French? If so that is a valid reason for hating him :P</div></div><hr />

Because, like it all the other bullsh!t they pull, they know the userbase tolerates it.<br />
<br />
There is no reason why new content, patches, etc., couldn't be properly tested. Out in the real world, there are very mature methodologies for testing massive real-time systems... And WoW is just another one of those. Of course, in the real world when scheduled maintenance that was supposed to end at 11AM gets pushed back hour-by-hour to 5PM the the people responsible don't get to put up a &quot;thank you for your patience&quot; message... They get fired. Within Blizzard, there's every reason to believe that the bean-counters have decided that it's more profitable to annoy players than pay what it would cost to properly test. And you can't fire QA staff that doesn't exist, can you?<br />
<br />
Actually, given the environment they deal with, I think the Blizz staff does as well as could be expected. It's just like so many other large corporations that are ruled by the short-term bottom-line thinking of bean-counters and lawyers... you have a bunch of not-very-well-paid, not-particularly-bright, not-effectively-motivated folks, muddling along in bureaucratically-enforced mediocrity.<br />
<br />
blizzard DOES have a great QA staff! Just not for WoW, SC2 was tested the heck out of see their credits and you see hundreds of names on the credits and the list just goes so huge. I bet Diablo is the same... WoW... uh lets just use beta testers, limited alpha testers(who probably aren't full time testers and work other roles within the company). Just because its an MMO doesn't make it satisfactory for letting players/customers find and diagnose problems for them. <br />
<br />
I which every developer had the mindset of Hideo Kojima, superb attention to detail, true pride in work and ultimate goal of making the best ever possible production down to every bit of sound and pixel that shows on the screen, seeking perfection.</div></div><hr />

<br />
EVERY other expansions world first was achieved from tagging mobs. So why all the hate now ? <br />
<br />
Simple you don't like athene. <br />
<br />
nothing wrong with the way he did it. A gm even told him he was ok to do it the way he did it in wotlk.<br />
<br />
All the haters are only happy when they have something to complain about. No one jumped up and down about the person that tagged everything to get world first in wotlk or the 40man raid that helped the rogue get world first in TBC.<br />
<br />
You only hate because you are ill informed (stupid)</div></div><hr />

And they should fix herbs fading out as you approach them - damn phasing.<br />
<br />
Nothing needs to be fixed, they are fading out because someone on a different phase picked it before you could.</div></div><hr />

Really? You read jealousy into that? You get embarrased too easily then.</div></div><hr />

It's definitely challenging to heal in Cataclysm and that's by design. We want players to pick and choose what spells to use and when. Those in your group will also need to be conscious of whether or not they're putting out enough DPS, taking too much damage, and more. You'll probably be pulling out more &quot;tricks&quot; from your bag than you've been doing in awhile. You're also going to miss a time or two, run out of mana at a bad time and find yourself trying to figure out just what went wrong. Even experienced healers are going to have to dig their heels in a bit.<br />
<br />
Okay, Did I read that right? Now not only do I have to time my heals and conserve mana ,which I'm fine with. But even if I cast at the right time, my heals can now miss? Well there's a wasted 3 secs and some mana. Guess I know why hit talents are in Healing Trees now, besides to level. Bad mechanic there.</div></div><hr />

Im not calling for a ban, Im not saying it was cheating, Im just saying its crap and I dont hold it in high regard at all. Not much of an acheivement. Sorry<br />
<br />
Pretty much 100% agree with that sentiment.<br />
<br />
The Daily Blink pretty much sums up what Athene achieved and how he achieved it.</div></div><hr />
