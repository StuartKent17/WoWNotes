I highly doubt this is another Store mount, they just released two not that long ago. I'm thinking this is going to be the mount from buying the CE</div></div><hr />

6.1 will probaly be a minor patch,just like the shieldwall/domination point was, they said the &quot;first major patch&quot; which will probaly means 6.2. QQ</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a brand new model. There are rarely ever new rigs added to this game beyond brand new player races. If this is rehashed, tell me what isn't rehashed. <br />
<br />
It's a brand new model and will likely have completely brand new animations and emotes. <br />
<br />
If you think reusing rigging is rehashed if it has a a brand new model and animations, you're just playing semantic games. That is not the Anzu model, it's a completely new render of the concept remade from hand using an old rigging.</div></div><hr />

That's not Proto-drake; it has more in common with the old-style drakes and dragons with that pose.<br />
<br />
And I'm hoping it's CE mount so the CE pet will be like the Ji-kun Hatchling, except in Raven Lord flavor. That would be cute.</div></div><hr />

200+ Without any store mounts over here. But then, I've got pretty much every single last mount except for some raid drops. People who already &quot;hit&quot; 250 or are &quot;close&quot; usually have all the store/TCG mounts. Still 250 could be possibly in WoD easily.</div></div><hr />

Its not confirmed where you get the mount from. Stop jumping to conclusions.<br />
<br />
Also, there's actually not that many mounts on the store. There's currently only 7 or 8. Compared to the number available for meta achievments alone, there's really nothing to complain about.<br />

The second pose clearly shows that it's using the proto-drake skeleton.<br />
<br />
You should probably learn to tell the difference between the skeleton and flight animations of the models. <br />
That looks more shaped and positioned like the Druid Flight Form model than any other 'mount' skeleton in the game. <br />

That is probably the animations it will share.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't the Pterrorwing's wings touch the ground? Please forgive me if I'm wrong, as I do not have one. If not, however, that would be great!

Ahh, thank you very much! uvu I'd be okay with that position, but this one looks like it should stand upright a little bit more, maybe sort of a throwback to Anzu when he's standing? But since this has a bigger wingspan, he'd have to fold them up a lot more.<br />
(I'm honestly just desperate for birds with 'landed' animations that aren't the &quot;sit&quot; for flight form or the regular proto-drake position. A girl can hope, can't she?)</div></div><hr />

3. Blizzard store<br />
4. Collectors edition<br />

Yeah, because as of late they haven't been making flying mounts useable in ground only areas...right? Even the TOT META mount is useable as a ground mount...<br />
<br />
I'm just hoping they'll make it clever so that this mount doesn't turn into a Raven Lord with updated model on the ground. Let it be a PROPER bird running like one and flying like one. We have no pure flying bird mounts in-game, they all have 4 legs or use their wings like a proto-drake when on the ground.</div></div><hr />

It is the DRUID FLIGHT FORM model reskinned. <br />
It is not a proto drake, proto drakes do not fly like that.</div></div><hr />

This wont be DRUID FLIGHT FORM since it can be mounted ( open image and see ). Not unless you will be able to mount druid soon and fly, but that would be OP....</div></div><hr />

<br />
I didn't say it was a Druid Flight Form, I said it is using the skeleton/model of it. <br />
It is a reskinned version of it. <br />
<br />
Everyone keeps calling it a Proto Drake reskin when the 2nd image is a flight animation that Proto Drakes don't even have. <br />
The flight animation is identical to druid's bird form.</div></div><hr />

Last time blizzard did new model mount was Heart of Aspects(cloud serpents are reskined HoA but just added more animations to not resemble it) and MoP collector edition. That was like 1 year ago?!? <br />
Hip Hip Horray for blizzard creativness, even with that bigger dev team :X<br />

1. Top 0.1% arena / RBG players<br />
2. Artistic design for WoD (leaked mount??)<br />
3. Blizzard store<br />
4. Collectors edition<br />
5. Participating in pre-expansion event for WoD (Never happened before, but things could change)<br />
6. Someone also mentioned it could be linked to Hearthstone (although I doubt it)<br />
<br />
I'd rather see it as a #3 than a #1, at least if its on the store everyone CAN get it. Keyword, can. As for it being linked to hearthstone, I don't know where these people are coming from but I am willing to bet that its Hearthsteed (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/142073-hearthsteed) and NOT that flying Anzu.</div></div><hr />

It cant be 1. There are already models of this and next seasons mounts in the game, yes those could be changed but it would fit the them of the expansion. I think its a finished or close to version of the storm crow.</div></div><hr />

If the theme was Throne of Thunder, I'd agree. The chimera was more in line to WOD themed, this is just another store mount which are being pushed out like nobodies busniess, every month or so, money money money. <br />

No one cares enough, can't wait for the best looking gear to be store bought.</div></div><hr />
