Patch 8.2 PTR - Conflict and Strife PvP Talent Changes<br />
The latest update to the PTR changed some of the more controversial PvP talents for certain specs. Here is a list of the ones that changed. Blizzard previously mentioned that the initial talents were not final and would be changed. To see the talents that haven't changed, check out our initial preview (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8530-Patch-8-2-PTR-Conflict-and-Strife-PvP-Talent-Essence).<br />

<br />
The chosen abilities in PTR data are not final. In particular, the ones that would clearly be overpowered or problematic in PvE (such as Leader of the Pack) are generally cases where the final decision of which PvP Talent to give hasn’t yet been made.<br />
<br />
The primary goal of Conflict and Strife is to provide an interesting choice in PvP by allowing access to an extra PvP Talent. It’s not necessarily going to be a strong option for PvE. The acquisition of this Essence is via PvP, and is totally optional for PvE-focused players. While there may be interesting PvE uses for some of the choices, it is not expected to be a strong competitor on usual PvE criteria (like total throughput) on every spec.<br />

<br />
&quot;Really hard&quot;? <br />
Ain't nothing &quot;hard&quot; about the fact that Oondasta is always relevant for people to kill, meaning he won't be up long enough/unattacked long enough to even begin a tame. The only way he'll be tameable is if you happen to be there before anyone else. That's not challenging, I hope you understand, that's luck. <br />
<br />
Tracking rares is a whole lot more of a challenge and requires patience too, really. Or the literal challenge tames used for the MoP spirit beasts.</div></div><hr />

The trap doesn’t always trigger correctly due to terrain or a movement suppression on the enemy (unlike Shamans Thunderbolt, Warriors Barrelthru or whatever it is, or even the Priest knockback).<br />
Oondasta is going to be terrible to tame, but will be kind of nice seeing any Hunters that get lucky, somehow.</div></div><hr />

It's really hard to win the lottery. It's really hard to turn up tails 800 times in a row. Luck (or better worded: extremely difficult/bad odds) can still make things hard.

<br />
I'd call it unlikely, not hard per sé. Maybe it's my first language, but hard to me = something one can overcome by working for it, not having luck. <br />
And as such I maintain that the current way of Oondasta spawning and the ability to tame him with be a question of luck, not hard earned through effort. <br />
<br />
And they should make him or a beast looking like him a challenge tame, as far less imposing, impressive models of beasts were before him.</div></div><hr />

It does insane dps vs fast attacking mobs...<br />

Did you even read what the ability does before complaining?</div></div><hr />

Why not pick a really useful talent and tone it down? Most of these are totally useless.</div></div><hr />

How is he wrong though? Seeing as it doesn't use the mobs health but rather your own (or maybe the tank's HP?) I'm not coming up with -that- incredible numbers for it (remember even using on CD it will only have about 20% uptime). Even looking at the &quot;help the tank kite&quot; part, you already have Typhoon to help out (with an even stronger slow) in most cases.<br />
<br />
Could see it maybe being useful as a misdirect ability if it acted that way (I have no idea who gets the threat generated by Thorns, if there even is any).</div></div><hr />

Even without smoke bomb, Rogue are one of the most useful DPS in the game. Sick AoE, passable ST, lots of surv, cloak for soaking, tricks, shroud and great control.<br />
<br />
I was speaking about the talent of this essence, not the class in general ;)</div></div><hr />

Yes I know what thorns does. There will be better choices.</div></div><hr />
