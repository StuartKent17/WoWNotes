Yelling at inept group members in 5mans/heroics/raids for three years has gotten old, and arena can go die in a goddamned fire for all I care.<br />
<br />
Then to top it off, every class and every buff got the shit homogenized out of it. Blizzard seems to be floundering in terms of what direction to go with in WoW.<br />

I really sincerely hope everyone enjoys WoTLK or whatever game you choose to play. But dont do what I did, and merely keep playing out of inertia.</div></div><hr />

The game is most likely already being packadged right now.<br />
All the cd's/dvd's contain are the graphics and music and stuff. All the balancing stuff is in the patch 3.0.2. Since all the balancing is available to everyone regardless if they have WOTLK or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thats still a considerable length of time. Theres a patch at least once per week on the beta realms updating things. Sure theres loads they still need to sort - including some zones (like Storm Peaks) and class balancing but the bulk of the work/content is done and any &quot;last minute&quot; changes will be patched in on the day of launch so they can continue fine tuning things right up until the day of release.<br />
<br />
2 months is alot of time for them to continue to work on classes. Remember what we see on the beta realm is several patchs behind what the developers are playing with.<br />
<br />
Until I see a date on the official WoW sites Im still skeptical about 13th Nov release but we'll know soon enough :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same kind of &quot;QQ blizzard will fix it&quot; we had to listen to the past 3½ years and blizzard to this date didnt fix it.<br />
<br />
Are you saying they will make huge sweeping changes to how the talent trees work for some classes right at the end of the beta? Even if they do that, you still expect them to be balanced considering the testing time left? And the fact they didnt do it until now even though they had ample opportunity speaks against you.<br />
<br />
not to mention the &quot;we are now testing and tweaking NUMBERS issue&quot; when what some classes need are entirely new talents+spells.</div></div><hr />

Joking aside, they have around 6 beta builds to fix quite a bit of stuff. Possible? Yes. Will they do it? Hopefully. Will the QQ stop? No, it's getting worse every single day - see above.</div></div><hr />

I hate to admit that ur right about the QQ...<br />

I think 6 Iterations is enough to resolve the Balance issues and fix the remaining content.</div></div><hr />

Storm Peaks and Icecrown is closed for crashing bugs, not that they are unfinished.<br />

<br />
<br />
see above.<br />
_<br />
Everyone is crying about balance since no one has the gear they [Blizzard] are balancing after yet, easy as that.<br />
They are making some radical changes, and apparently half the player-base is diehard conservatists.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
My...God. Blizzard is trying to make players quit and lose money. They are trying their hardest to BREAK the classes they made and torture the players who play them. THIS IS A SLAP IN THE FACE, BLIZZ.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Do you know how raid/pvp decked classes perform at 80? No? Neither do i. I still have confidence in Blizzard because they are an excellent team. Flame me if you wish, atleast i know you can't satisfy 11 million players, while also implementing new features, new mechanics and rebalancing, especially during beta when every single change gets 5 separate QQ-threads, by people with no other beta knowledge than changelogs on mmo-champion.<br />
<br />
Granted i am not in the beta, but i sure as hell don't cry about minor changes when i know nothing about the other beta conditions, like player health, mana pools, cooldowns..<br />

That is true, but this time only a major setback in production could delay the release. Remember that they've worked on WotLK for 2 years, and had a Beta period of, 2 months now? BC had 3 (or 4?).<br />
The game [WotLK, not BC] was &quot;guaranteed&quot; a Q4 release, and hopefully we won't see a delay</div></div><hr />

<br />
And then you end up with more QQ from people whining that it's not been released yet, and that they're bored of the content that is available to them, and are considering quitting from WoW yadda yadda yadda... Bottomline is: People never are happy with what they are given.</div></div><hr />

They still have 2 months.<br />

I'd be more pissed if they delayed it than releasing it and classes are quite unbalanced 70-79, and fine at 80 (which is their main priority)</div></div><hr />

You do realize that's exactly what the blue posters would say right?<br />
<br />
Unless it's been posted on their mainpage, they simply deny everything. Whatever the reason behind Wowhead and other sites having the ad up now, before the mainpages, i'm sure it will all be revealed in due time. Enough with the whining and QQing.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, you guys who are still doubting it, why? I mean, if you ask Blizzard, they'll just say ''No, no, NO''. Why do you think they do that? They love to have you guessing. They don't want to reveal anything, of course. I mean, what would be the fun in that for Blizzard?<br />
<br />
Also, didn't someone mention that the reason that they aren't making things completely perfect at first was to shove all the immature and whining players to WAR so that WoW would get a better community? That would make sense, at least.<br />
<br />
Also, you don't know if they still need to fix a lot of stuff or if they're just keeping certain things secret from everyone, even beta players. Wouldn't that make sense?<br />
<br />
Anyways, even if it hasn't been officially confirmed by Blizzard, it will be a very high chance of being released at that day or very close to it. So just be silent and wait patiently for the game to be released. If you want to go cry about things somewhere, go play the Hello Kitty MMO instead, they have enough cups of care for you over there. Seriously, if you're not satisfied then most people couldn't care less.<br />
<br />
Wait patiently for the expansion to be released, and enjoy it. Trust me, it will be awesome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
BINGO! This guy has it right. Have you ever known them to have ANYTHING finished by release? They'll have about a month after release to tune all the classes to lvl 80 PvP, as season 5 won't start until at least then. As long as it's fixed by season 5 patch everyone will be happy. They just need to get BG's and wintergrasp working.<br />
Tuning for PvE should take minutes as each DPS class should have a rotation which gives the best DPS, they just tune each spell's base damage a bit, and make further changes when new content is released. They should be able to have a good shot at this before launch, and then fine-tune it on whatever feedback they get from hardcore guilds. This will mostly apply to healers, as they won't want the shaman stacking to be quite so bad.</div></div><hr />

No, they only said it should be treated as speculation. Mind you, speculation does not disprove the facts.<br />
Think about it, how would it look like if blues said &quot;yes, guys, wowhead and thottbot are right, this IS THE ACTUAL WLK DATE&quot;. Sounds funny right, this is the best diplomatic answer they can give which doesn't confirm nor deny the date.<br />
Also, since it's not 1st of April, and considering the seriousness of Wowhead and Thottbot, I'd say this is some marketing move by Blizzard, this could very well be the actual release date.<br />

I know you're being sarcastic, but I'll just ignore that ignorance in an ironic way and comment that finally someone is seeing the light.<br />

Ofcourse they don't use a real date, they don't even know the date themselves yet, else they had announced it a long time ago already. Like all other game companies do all the time, they'd just give a date much earlier than what they expect, to keep people hooked and hyped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yet, they'll want to have it released some time between now and early December, to have it on the #1 spot in shops across the world by Christmas. <br />
Also, it's unlikely to be released tomorrow, or before the end of October, as they'll want to finish testing on the 3.0.2 patch. This means it's out sometime between early November and mid-December.<br />
This means, even if it's just a random guess, there's a 1-in-40-or-so chance it's right. <br />
What's more, so what if it's 1 day wrong? (ie. is it launched at 23.59pm, or 0.01am?) Then it's about 1-in-20 chance of it being right. <br />
That's a 5% drop rate. Woo.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;I trust it to be real&quot; camp, and the &quot;It's fake, you n00bs&quot; camp. And when Blizzard confirm it, the second camp disappear and you never hear from them again. Or, if Blizzard deny it, the second camp say &quot;I told you so&quot;.<br />
<br />
It was the same with Diablo 3.. two huge camps of people, one camp suddenly went silent when Blizzard confirmed the game.<br />
<br />
While it's wise to wait until a Blue confirms/denies the date later today, signs indicate the date is real based on the Blizzard date graphics being used. Also, a blue on the official forums posted two or so weeks ago that they knew the date and would be announcing it soon. So this does fit. It's strange that a fan site has got the news out before the official site, but that doesn't mean to say it's not real.<br />

<br />
As a beta tester i can say entire areas of the content havent even been opened to testing yet,and some classes are still completely broken and in some cases nigh-unplayable.<br />
<br />
At the moment, bringing a shaman to a raid or a pvp team, is gimping said team.<br />
<br />
Funny how people said &quot;stop QQing, blizzard will fix you&quot; when shamans said it was happening all over again.<br />
<br />
well, what do those &quot;its just beta&quot; people say now?!<br />
<br />
This is the worst thing blizzard could ever do to the wow franchise, and may end up causing a lot more to leave than WAR will: Releasing content that isnt tested and is far from finished, with enourmous balance flaws.<br />
<br />
<br />
Point is, they haven't released it. Part of the content was deployed to the PTR in a strategic move to spoil the WAR early access and launch phase a bit for EA but that's it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Another interesting fact about the date is that it's just 1 day before the release of the 1st expansion for Lord of the Rings Online.<br />
<br />
Ok, everyone's forgotten about that one since Conan/Warhammer but I think it's still got quite a few people playing it and I would suspect they (the Lord of the Rings people) would've been hoping to have their bit in the spotlight again with their expansion. If WotLK is released on the 13th that'll really screw over LOTRO.</div></div><hr />

Its not mentioned on blizzard site. Its not mentioned on official wrath site. its not mentioned on worldofwarcraft.com<br />
<br />
Only place that mentions it is wowhead.com.. Could be fucking made up for all I know.<br />
<br />
If you do the math on timing.. they have 8 weeks...<br />
<br />
- 6 weeks to finish the game<br />
- 2 weeks for packaging/shipping<br />
<br />
How long is 3.0 gonna sit on ptr for? Surely no more than 3 - 4 weeks given the timeframe to complete the game. Giving them another week to push a final patch out/test...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
what you fail to realise is the amount of content that isnt client dependent.<br />
<br />
The only thing your getting on the dvd is textures / models and sounds, everything else is server side. The fact that X isnt balanced, and Y isnt implemnted yet, and Z is buggy to hell, doesnt make a difference for the release DVD.<br />
<br />
I cant see this release being fake, wowhead has quite a good reputation, that would be blown to shit if it was a stunt / fake.</div></div><hr />

Project Lore is in partnership with Wowhead, which along with thottbot is owned by Zam.<br />
<br />
So far, we have claims by Zam that it gets released on this day, with no evidence only &quot;This is a legitimate advertisement from Blizzard.&quot;<br />
Blizzard have twice denied these claims on their own forums as 'speculation', http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=9956327893&amp;sid=1#1 and http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=9956327893&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=12#228<br />
<br />
So far, the evidence is against this release date. And before anyone says &quot;well a blue wouldn't know about the official release date&quot;, they're much more likely to than Zam who have no links to Blizzard.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think that a site as respectable as wowhead would risk their reputation by putting up a bogus announcement that would only yield a short team increase of advertisement revenue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But past this...<br />
<br />
1) COLLECTOR'S EDITION?<br />
2) Can we pre-load the game from the Blizzard store and have it ready to go at midnight local time on the 13th? (like Steam)</div></div><hr />

I think Nov 13th is probably what they're aiming for if they're following a process that they followed with BC. And when you consider BC release included a Christmas holiday period.. that gives WOTLK even more time.</div></div><hr />

If it was put on there and taken down then great, that's proof enough that this release date was at one point official and it's likely that wowhead jumped the gun and put it ahead of the agreed time.</div></div><hr />

WotLK is a sure sale this is why they will hold it back till after christmas cause consumers will buy up on other &quot;gifts&quot; over christmas and the return in jan to purchase WotLK.<br />

I'm pretty sure this didn't actually happen. BC never had an announced release date until they said Jan 19th<br />

everyone assumed November and was disappointed because they were stupid.</div></div><hr />

yeah yeah yeah... Wal Mart this, Wal Mart that...<br />
<br />
when Blizz says its 13.11, its 13.11!!<br />
<br />
The game is ready for release, just needs to be polished... Even if they don't do it until the release, they can do it in a patch later...<br />
<br />
Vivendy &quot;needs the money before the end of the year&quot;... They're doing less money this year since Blizz hasn't sold anything yet.... So it will have to come out before the end of the year... <br />
<br />
They said it would come out in the last quarter of the year and then confiremed the announcement...<br />
<br />
Believe it, believe in the 13th of November</div></div><hr />

Everyone is crying about balance since no one has the gear they [Blizzard] are balancing after yet, easy as that.<br />
They are making some radical changes, and apparently half the player-base is diehard conservatists.<br />
<br />
Do you know how raid/pvp decked classes perform at 80? No? Neither do i. I still have confidence in Blizzard because they are an excellent team. Flame me if you wish, atleast i know you can't satisfy 11 million players, while also implementing new features, new mechanics and rebalancing, especially during beta when every single change gets 5 separate QQ-threads, by people with no other beta knowledge than changelogs on mmo-champion.<br />
<br />
Granted i am not in the beta, but i sure as hell don't cry about minor changes when i know nothing about the other beta conditions, like player health, mana pools, cooldowns..<br />
