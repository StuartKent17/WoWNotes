Warlords of Draenor - Solar Spirehawk Mount<br />
You may remember the Stormcrow mount (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3320-Patch-5-4-Stormcrow-Mount-Ghostcrawler-Interview-Blue-Posts-News-Recap) which was added to the files during Patch 5.4, but never went live. A similar fiery mount has appeared : Solar Spirehawk (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/171828-solar-spirehawk).<br />
<br />
Some people appear to have forgotten as of late, so keep in mind that this is beta. Animations, models, sounds, and everything else are not final.<br />

FEEDBACK: Highmaul - Walled City (LFR)<br />
Highmaul seems to be open (before Twins) so technically he could be the first boss.<br />
<br />
Ye but its very wierd that Tectus is simply not there. The achiev is called the Walled City after all and thats clearly the &quot;first floor&quot; of Higmaul. It would be senseless if the second wing started on Tectus and had the other 3 bosses when the area where the last 3 bosses are situated is clearly distinct from the area of the first 4. just make it so that the first wing has Kargath, Tectus, Butcher and Brakenspore and the second wing the other 3 bosses.<br />
We changed the wing structure and the achievement hasn't been updated yet - that's fixed next build.<br />
<br />
The first wing consists of these three bosses. The second wing consists of Tectus, Twin Ogron, and Ko'ragh. There will be some obstacles to bar your path when this is all finalized, and the zone-in location logic is currently letting you wander around parts of the city that should be inaccessible. Converting a non-linear layout into a linear path for Raid Finder is nothing new (e.g. the door to Blackfuse being locked when you queue for Underhold, or the entrance to Spoils being closed for Downfall). We want to keep Raid Finder wings to 3 bosses maximum unless we have absolutely no choice, to help keep the time commitment for doing a wing to a reasonable level.

Hunter Feedback<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/271-Hunter) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/hunter) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#M))<br />
Hey all. Please focus on continuing to give good feedback, not the style/amount of our responses to said feedback. We're just extremely busy, not ignoring or spiteing you.<br />
<br />
Now then... Yes, the Marksmanship and Survival rotations are simpler than they were before. The goal is to have a simpler baseline rotation, and have meaningful choices that allow you to layer more depth onto that in talents, if you choose.<br />
<br />
Hunters have a ton of talents which grant rotational or short CD abilities, to support this design. However, they were lacking in rotational depth. The gameplay of most of them boiled down to &quot;use on cooldown&quot;. No need to think about preparing for when you're going to use it, or how it interacts with your rotation, etc. So, we're going to make some tweaks to try to add some rotational depth to several of the talent choices.<br />
<br />
<br />
Barrage is being changed to make it more rotational, with Focus-pooling gameplay required to min/max its benefit. You'll want to pool 60 Focus in anticipation of it coming off cooldown. <br />
Barrage now has a 20sec CD (down from 30sec), costs 60 Focus (up from 30 Focus), and deals 100% additional damage. Murder of Crows had a cooldown-shortening effect that hardly mattered in practice; either the fight would likely be over within 1min if used on a low-healh boss, or you'd likely waste most of the damage of the crows if used on a low-health add. Instead, we're changing that mechanic, so that it's primarily useful on those low-health adds. You'll want to time it well to finish off low health targets, while still being as Focus-efficient as possible.<br />
Murder of Crows has been changed. Its duration, cost, and cooldown have been reduced by 50%. It no longer has a shorter cooldown when used on low health targets. Instead, its cooldown is reset if the target dies. The gameplay of Fervor and Dire Beast were extremely similar, so we opted to replace Fervor completely. It's rather late in the development process to be doing that, so went with something tried and true: Steady Focus. This iteration of Steady Focus purely increases Focus regeneration, and has a duration short enough to add depth.<br />
Fervor has been replaced with Steady Focus: Using Cobra Shot or Steady Shot twice in a row, or using Focusing Shot, increases your Focus Regeneration by 50% for 10 sec.<br />
<br />
We think that these changes will allow Hunters of all types to customize their gameplay to their liking.<br />
<br />
Oh, completely forgot that another relevant change hasn't made it into one of your builds yet. Apologies.<br />
<br />
Lock and Load is returning to the previous version of it, and Multistrikes will simply do more damage for Survival instead.<br />
<br />
To clarify.. is it reverting to how it works on Live servers or the version that relies on Black Arrow. I assume the Black Arrow one which I am pretty okay with.<br />
It's changing to... 20% chance on Black Arrow tick (not multistrikes, and guaranteed to get at least 1 proc per Black Arrow cast). Effect is to reset ExS's cooldown, and cause the next two ExSs to cost no focus and trigger no cooldown.<br />
<br />
Lots of responses like this so far:<br />
<br />
These changes are great. However, they still don't address anything about MM's core issues.<br />
We don't view specs by their baseline untalented rotations, because their baseline untalented rotations never matter. What matters is the complete package. The complete package includes some baseline abilities, some talent on rows where all affect your rotation, and some optional rotation-affecting talents to complicate things further. It makes it very customizable. Most of you are quite experienced and will enjoy significant added rotational complexity, which is available to you.<br />
<br />
Oh one more VERY important thing: Will the LnL effect have a 10 second internal cooldown as it does on live? Would be fantastic if it didn't.<br />
No.<br />
<br />
This is concerning. It means that &quot;cookie cutter&quot; talent builds are coming back, correct? Despite the possibility to choose, it seems that we'll be stuck at a &quot;superior&quot; talent choice (e.g. the L45 row for warriors)<br />
No, that is not implied in what I said. <br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Racials<br />
Months of beta testing, release 3 months away, yet no changes to EMFH? Still &quot;wait and see&quot; or are you keeping the OP racial as is?<br />
We aren't planning changes to Every Man for Himself. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501205312150327296))<br />

PSA: On beta, it's very hard for you to have much perspective of how you spec's performance compares to others. The goal is everyone equal. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501658285561225216))<br />
.So when you see nerfs/buffs, keep that in mind. Very easy to be overpowered and not realize it, and be surprised by nerfs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501658968205189120))<br />
<br />
Although pretty the spell effect for Light of Dawn looks like an explosion, could we get a glyph so it looks less like raid AE?<br />
No need; only you see it like that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501284231457161216))<br />
M'kay still annoying but i assume it won't take long to get used too.<br />
Yeah. We find that people are able to quite easily adapt to their own flashy visuals. No need to tone down your own. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501285250081628160))<br />
<br />
Healing Tonics heal for 68k, and Healthstones heal for 50k at lvl100. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501813561983655936))<br />
Why not make both %healing? That way after first tier they won't be nearly worthless. In MoP Pots went from 20% to ~3%<br />
Hyperbole is a wonderful thing, isn't it?But no, crafted items need to be replaced each expansion. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501826442934489088))<br />
I'd like to see how far Versatility takes the Tonic/HS each tier before I call the flat base heal &quot;worthless.&quot;<br />
Versatility would indeed affect both of them. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501828218525978624))<br />
<br />
does the change to improved server responsiveness have any impact on the &quot;not in range&quot; problem with melee?<br />
Somewhat, yes, though not as huge as it does on other issues. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501844025876312065))<br />

Are y'all going to buff Surging Mist for WW? Because right now, I much rather have my healing orb than weak cast<br />
What you're seeing is not a difference between Healing Sphere and Surging Mist, but rather Mists vs Warlords healing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501222466522316800))<br />

Can BrM get healing spheres back? And/or afterlife glyph effect for BrM too? Hard cast surging mists != the ease of droping orbs<br />
It's just not intended to be used while actively in combat. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501241104260272128))<br />

Merging two Blessings would free up a keybind for paladins. Is there a reason why we have two of them?<br />
Because the alternative isn't merging, it's removing. Having two blessings is a slight *gain* for Paladins. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501251561201233920))<br />
<br />
any thoughts of the manditory beacon of faith switching gameplay holy pala got atm? You guys happy with it being as effective?<br />
Happy with it being a minor min/maxy thing, yeah. As long as its impact stays minor. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501275428636467201))<br />
BoF is mandatory which makes Glyph of BoL mandatory aswell. Any chance the glyph baseline will become baseline?<br />
Neither of those is true. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501288628681596928))<br />
how are we supposed to build HP if not with macroing glyped BoL or BoF with HL/FoL?<br />
The same way you always have. You don't have to go *that* heavy on HoPo abilities, you realize, right? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501295925965230080))<br />
Like, if you do that, you're giving up a significant amount of healing elsewhere. That's not insignificant. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501296041430241280))<br />
So with casting HR? That's way too expensive. or are you also tuning that with the healer tuning passes?<br />
HR is one tool you have, sure. You also can just use beacons as beacons, and heal. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501297293417402372))<br />
I mean, obviously, the quintessential healing style for Paladins is to Beacon a tank, heal the party with HL/WoG/LoD. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501297650608517121))<br />
The problem with that is that all our non-HP abilities heal for a pittance currently.<br />
Not if you're actually using your Beacon(s) for healing, instead of HoPo. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501299382910992384))<br />
What about the other 100 talents then? Hope you can make those viable as well.<br />
Indeed we can. Talents have strengths and weaknesses. Ignoring them is a bad idea. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501307208278097920))<br />

Shadow CC is good? In comparison to what? A Discipline or Holy Priest that forgot to spec their CC talent?<br />
In comparison to most specs in the game. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501204709764366338))<br />
<br />
Chastise is more of an interrupt than a CC, it's short and constantly on DR. May change in WoD but maybe make it 4-5s?<br />
It allows you to set up further CC. I don't see us buffing the duration of Chastise. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501205637854801920))<br />
<br />
We don't have 4, two are on same tier and why are you brushing aside the weaknesses highlights? Address our concerns!<br />
I'm brushing them aside because they are all totally reasonable &quot;weaknesses.&quot; There are 4 in MoP. They left out scream (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501203933142843392))<br />
Scream, Fiend, Tendrils, MC, Silence, Horror, Chastise. Shadow=4, Holy=3, Disc=2. Easily counterable is not reasonable!<br />
I'm open to concerns from Disc about CC, but not shadow. They're fine. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501208347861712896))<br />

Why does Siegebreaker replace Intimidating? It's a one second knock-down..on a 45sec CD...<br />
Frequency matters a lot, as does the power of the knockback. We don't want to increase Warrior CC. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501828154990661632))<br />
<br />
right now it's like 10-15 yards. Honestly put the stun on the end up 1-2 seconds and it fits better where DR is now.<br />
Yeah, it's a knock *back*, of about 10yd. That's a big deal, especially on a Warrior. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501830551775358976))<br />
In what scenario would you want to knock them away from you?<br />
When you want to interrupt a cast. When you have Charge up. When you want to knock a target out of an AOE clump, to CC it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501831559419142145))<br />
When you've just Heroic Leaped past them and want to knock them back toward your teammates. When you want to get a mob to a clump. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501831718026743808))<br />
<br />
.. You should just remove the knock-down then. As that basically makes the talent unusable in pvp. Maybe that's the point but...<br />
Uhh... So very confused. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501828369554493440))<br />
Giving up intim is a lot to ask for. You're giving up one ability for another... Trading CC for damage...<br />
And for a different but also quite strong CC. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501829971224961024))<br />
Not found of new lvl 100 talent to be honest. It looks like nerfed DR. 1 sec is a strong cc? Not really.<br />
It's not DR'd, and the knockback is the big part of its CC value. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501833080949460992))<br />
Why not put it on the stun tier instead if it's meant to be a strong CC?<br />
Because it's a tradeoff, not a direct gain. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501834006480973824))<br />
<br />
after all these changes, warriors get a new talent because they had a boring passive one. What about venom rush? Thoughts?<br />
That's distinctly *not* why Ignite Weapon was replaced. And it wasn't boring/passive anyway. A passive on each row is a good thing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501666844105666561))<br />
If the passive is good/fun design. Basic resource regeneration for the final tier is underwhelming?<br />
With a bit of gameplay of trying to maintain it on multiple targets? Yes. We like to have one talent that doesn't complexify things. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501668596318076930))<br />
I worry you don't realize how big Ignite Weap was for us who -hate- CS pooling gameplay. RB extending CS just further added 2 it<br />
The glyph is there for that gameplay desire. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501854227132477440))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
I gotta ask, what is design philosophy in making the CD's on Mr Smite's Compass, Manastorm Duplicator, et al so long (2 hours!!!)<br />
So we can add a ton more of them without you annoying your raid by insisting they &quot;check out that noise&quot; on every pull. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/501537365504958464))<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
What's the secondary stat value design philosophy in Warlords? Worth 1/4 as much as Primary stats? 1/2 as much? Equal to?<br />
Generally 1/2. Spirit and Bonus Armor are more in the realm of 3/4. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501508588150329344))<br />
Those are rough estimates though; what's important is that secondaries are balanced against each other. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501508691992903680))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
abit confused about how WoD lockouts works. Can i do(wipe) mythic with guild and then run heroic with friends for loot?<br />
Yes. Every difficulty has a separate lockout. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/501443705178312705))<br />
<br />
Will 6.0 Mythic SOO still be cross realm?<br />
Yes. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/501505517965938689))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Melee dodge/parry still too high in beta pvp, some rng ok but having entire rotations dodged/parried without cooldowns is too much.<br />
Yeah we're looking at the values. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501432966782795776))<br />
<br />
Hello you, wondering if skirmishes will come with Wod or pre wod patch ?<br />
Pre-WoD patch. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501789017180864513))<br />
<br />
What about Parry in PvP? Chances are still very high. Got ~20% DKs should go up to ~35%. Any plans to change this?<br />
We're looking into it (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501760391782105089))<br />
why not 100% chance to hit, 0% chance to be dodged, 3% chance to be parried, 3% chance to be blocked for everyone?<br />
Many classes have survivability built around the amount of dodge/parry they receive from stats. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/501801779328061440))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
But all the veils were haunted at best during BC - So they were built by ghosts..?<br />
There is one haunted veil in SMV. The rest are live arakkoa. Go check out Terokkar again. (_DonAdams (https://twitter.com/_DonAdams/status/501751705147822080))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Lots of cool rewards from Garrison buildings, do we keep them if we earn them then swap the building out?<br />
For the most part, yes, except passives. Example: not the stables tier 3 global speed bonus, but you do keep the mounts. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/501560773026795520))<br />
<br />
So many 1k+ items in garrison. Blueprints. Farm tools. Any worries it's too expensive?<br />
Get a feel for it when you have multiple buildings producing for you, open to feedback. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/501561092888596481))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Why do official notes tend to go up after the builds get pushed live Would it not make alot of these questions alot less common?<br />
They take time. Rather not delay one to wait for the other. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501527510383734784))<br />
Fair enough, but is a list not already in existence between the idea and the actual code changes being made?<br />
Yes. There's just a lot of work that goes into getting it into full Patch Note quality. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/501532818145415168))<br />
<br />
So the official story is Gamon died I guess to the heroic fight? Even though you can save him in normal mode.<br />
.Canon is that he survived, and is called Hero of Orgrimmar. You'll find him drinking upstairs in Org Inn, with a lady friend. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/501534713278787584))<br />

This confuses me.

<br />
The reason LFR in Mists isn't &quot;short&quot; is because it's tuned to require some degree of coordination in order to beat it. If 25 people all ilvl496 ran in with no flex/normal/heroic experience whatsoever, didn't say a single word to each other and ran into any of the &quot;Downfall&quot; boss mechanics, there'd be non-stop wipes until everyone finally left.</div></div><hr />

It means they're making LFR more casual. That business about being as hard as Mists LFR is bollocks. They're taking away most of the good rewards from it and tuning it accordingly. Put on your Blizzard Diplomatic Statement glasses and you'll see the truth!</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sekar</div><div class="date">2014-08-26, 06:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It [chastise] allows you to set up further CC.<br />
<br />
Perhaps that is imagined as setup for someone else's CC.<br />
<br />
Most holy priests in WoD PvP are usually going to have the nerfed psychic scream as the one CC they can get from the talent row then. Psychic scream is instant, commonly used to get rid of enemies on one's tail for a couple moments before they break it and come back.<br />
<br />
Chastise's prime usage is not as setup for psychic scream.<br />
<br />
Maybe this curious comment is because the developers not only balance PvP around top-rated arena but focus on it almost to the exclusion of all other PvP, envisioning a priest being carried by one of the (frankly small minority) of players who coordinate their CC to that degree.<br />
<br />
But being dependent on being carried by another player isn't that fun, even aside from the question of who would want to carry a CC-halved WoD priest. (Some classes lost almost none of their CC in WoD in comparison). And it is inapplicable in how most players PvP most of the time (as Blizzard could see from their own playtime statistics), in random battlegrounds, world PvP, and so on. Does Blizzard imagine everyone fighting in Ashran will have a babysitting teammate with voice coordination at all times? I hope not, as that's not realistic, not for casual non-prescheduled recreation. Not everyone treats their recreation like a part-time job.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scream, Fiend, Tendrils, MC, Silence, Horror, Chastise. Shadow=4, Holy=3, Disc=2.<br />
<br />
Not only twitter-level design analysis but bad math. In WoD (which is the relevant time as only stating the MoP number would be just misleading), holy has 2 CC (or rather more like 1.5 or less really). Disc has 1. Period.<br />
<br />
Even in vanilla, non-shadow priests had more CC than they will in WoD. The historical combo of one multi-target-usable CC, plus the situational tactics of Mind Control even back when it was slower cast, was more interesting and fun than, for example, how WoD disc priests will only have 1 total CC.<br />
<br />
Increasing cast time, reducing duration, and nerfs like that would be fine, but little can be more unpleasant to look forward to (in a MMORPG all about having a future of progressing and raising up your character) than an &quot;expansion pack&quot; (deletion pack) of outright removed abilities.<br />
<br />
In WoD, even holy paladins actually have more CC, if comparing the durations and cooldowns of the multiple CC they can have.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, with 4 bosses, it really makes you consider dropping group if you have a lot of dead-weights on the first boss. But with 3 bosses, as long as you beat the first boss, you don´t mind sticking with the group.</div></div><hr />

You seem to be under the impression that once MoP hits, you won't be able to fly at all. How is it possible people still think this? The only place you won't be able to fly is in the new MoP areas.</div></div><hr />

Often this is simply not the case, unless you count a meaningful choice as holding off energy (focus, runes, each energy system) a bit... that's not a viable choice if the skills require it, that's just the one efficient way. There's too much of that with these supposed meaningful choices. In a class rotation there is seldom room for meaningful choice within the same role with how WoW's combat works; instead the meaningful choice is often whenever/if you use utility, movement, Aoe,cooldowns etc skills right. That's why it's frustrating to read about slowing down energy, focus etc to make more meaningful choices for dps, because it's just slowing it down, that's all.</div></div><hr />

If it was up to me I'd simply remove all racials, they only create imbalances between races. The only ones I'd keep would be the profession based ones, and Gobber, stuff that really doesn't affect combat at all.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the cc tone down is it in fact going to make as big an issue than it was in mop?<br />
<br />
I'm not so sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If CC breaking is that good, it means every PVPer will get the trinket. So basically, since it doesn't stack with the trinket effect, EMFH is not better than the proc of your worse trinket (+life ou +stat). Is it better than Ud fear break or Gnome freedom ?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saberstrike</div><div class="date">2014-08-26, 10:20 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Human racial is considered OP because it lets you without a backthought carry a second 'power' trinket instead of one inferior 'utility' trinket. That's extra ~5% pvp power, which is a direct performance boost in the current model. Unless they buff insignia to match the stats of a proper trinket, human racial will remain op.<br />
<br />
Undead racial was op for a long time but it still doesn't allow an undead to just gain an extra item slot. Same for gnomes.</div></div><hr />

I was quite sure I read, not too long ago, that they WERE planning changes to EMFH?<br />
<br />
Less CC-intensive PvP reduces EMFH value and available trinket options may reduce it further. Just have to wait and see.<br />

Lets remove flying from the expansion content then add more flying mounts.<br />
<br />
From new zones only in the base install and probably what, 1 more major patch? before it reverts to normal flying for L100s. Boo-hoo-hoo, so many tears.</div></div><hr />

Shadow was always the weakest CC class and always the worst pve class. The one time it was fun and high up was in late cata but that just couldn't be left alone could it? Nah let's change everything about it despite no one having wanted the changes.<br />
<br />
These devs are morons imo. I think all the talent left. If wow came out now or a couple years later it would've died. Casualization is in full ramp because they really can't keep people who want better. Yeah make some mythic raids and arena pvp but the rest is crap.<br />
<br />
Shadow cc is fine, lol. The reason spreists are complaining about CC is because we don't have much defense, burst, healing (anymore) and escapability. Perhaps we should change from not enough CC to not enough mobility and escapability. We'll all spec and glyph shields so we can have a little better defense but still be easily lockable.<br />
<br />
what nitwits these devs are. Glad I'll have more work committments. This way the only thing that will get me to buy WoD is boredom and then i'll just be a super casual which will lead me to just quit once and for all. That's all they want any way and the $15 a month.</div></div><hr />

Personally I see no interest in even playing WoD, the same old crap over and over again. It feels like they have a set of monkeys throwing out ideas for every expansion and one supercomputer building it all up using the same template they've been using since vanilla. It's just sad. It really is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be honest, i'm glad they put resources on it.<br />
It allows people like myself to play the game on their own.<br />
I don't really care gear as having all top tier bis slots items anymore, just enough gear i can solo old raids for transmog and other items.<br />
Yet i still like to see the story and most of the expansions main story is within the raids.<br />
I enjoy the non social aspect of raiding, you can go in and see the instance without interaction if wished and i have no intentions going back to hardcore raiding or highly like even to guild raiding. As a previous class officer in hardcore guild i don't miss the drama at all.<br />
<br />
In a guild the drama and whispers especially to officers were endless, regardless of the guild or it's level in progression. Seen my share over many years which was enough.<br />
If the arguments weren't about loot or legendaries, it was jealousy, in-game romances, who's sleeping with who favoritism, just backstabbing and talking trash behind peoples backs. And it always, in every guild i've been lead to this, eventually. Might take couple years, but that's where it ended. Even on one occasion, grown ass 30 year old men, irl best friends, not talking to each other for months over a 5man blue gear piece.<br />
The endless hours of raiding wasn't nearly as exhausting as the bitching on any matter small or big.<br />
Even the smallest guilds of 10man raid team had members who didn't get along with each other.<br />
<br />
For that LFR is a god sent, yes people chat and profanities go around, but when the momentary lfr is done, they are gone.<br />
You yourself can continue onwards on your merry way and don't have to be in the middle, solving everyone's personal problems.<br />
No LFR is not real raiding, but to be honest i don't really care and i doubt many others doing it don't care either.<br />
And as Blizzard themselves has said, it serves 2 completely different audiences, and with MoP it doesn't force the &quot;real raiders&quot; to even enter LFR even once.<br />
So why are the normal and heroic raiders whining on something they don't need to do being a waste of resources, i don't do pet battles, but many others do, yet i'm not complaining them being waste.<br />
Essentially it's the same instance, same bosses, same layout and same initial resources used, only difference is the tuning of health and ability hardness on bosses.<br />
I don't see as many LFR bosses unlike normal difficulty bosses being retuned because they are too hard, they have mostly been tuned once to so easy anyone can basically do them.<br />
From Mop i remember 2 bosses that were nerfed, Durumu and General Narzgrim. Might have forgotten if others, but those two i remember being nerfed.<br />
So i'd say that's pretty minimal what they've used resources on this, they've used a lot more to a lot more stupider.<br />
<br />
When randomly putting together 25 people, what's to be expected, not everyone is dedicated as some might be. That's why the harder difficulties exist, guild groups of 3 difficulties, ilvl measured pugs, openraid community and the good old trade yelling. There's so many ways to choose who to play with, i can't see that being a reason to hate lfr (cause it contains idiots). So what is it, the fact that people with lesser effort can equip purple colored gear? Oh dear the elitism, if i have the bis no one else can have anywhere close to it, i worked hard for it. Lol i say, normal person who plays one main and happened to be really skilled enough to get to a world top hardcore guild vs someone who has 2000 days playtime over 12 alts and hasn't done hardcore raiding in 3 years, but roleplays in-game, yeah worked ;).. Gimme a break. Best way to solve that is the old RPG way, every gear is white, stats may be different, but colors don't mean squat.<br />
<br />
It's pretty stress free enviroment to see the content only better option being solo, which is always possible 1-2 xpacs later on.</div></div><hr />
