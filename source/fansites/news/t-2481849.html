Yeah right. Nothing to do with the cost cutting these days and it was natural events were going to be on the chopping block.<br />
<br />
And please nobody wants to see your mobile stuff at Blizzcon. Save it for some lesser event. Did the Diablo Immortal reaction/shitstorm not show that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Going to conventions takes resources and staff, some of which was cut in the bloodletting a few months back. It is a positive in my book that they are taking the hit and not going to gamescom and re-focusing on the base. Focusing on the development of games and frankly Blizzcon matters.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs an epic Blizzcon to get itself off the mat and focused going forward. It makes perfect sense to save everything for a major home court event. If they showed up at gamescom and announced basically nothing, it would have been seen as another loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the crazy thing is, even at $550, they will still sell out instantly. They know this, hence prices keep going up and up(well beyond covering inflation)<br />
<br />
Also, given their last announcment at blizzcon that got less than a warm reception, i think/hope they are holding their cards until blizzcon this year to hopefully make it a good one and not turn it into some insulting memes again.</div></div><hr />

Because every american goes to Blizzcon :rolleyes: stop speaking for other people.<br />
<br />
I don't find it insulting I'd rather get a shivering Blizzcon I can watch at home if I'm really interested than a Gamescon where I'll have to pay for the trip just for 1 conference. The Blizzcon ticket is cheaper and I can at least watch it in the comfort of my home.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think WoW is a reason. Gamescom would be closer to 8.3 release (I guess ~6 months from 8.2, so around December) than Blizzcon to 8.2 (~7-8 months between them). Probably they have some early 8.3 stuff done already.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sad, always looked forward to Gamescom due to Blizzards announcements...<br />
<br />
It's rare view anyway. Only time we had something close to Blizzcon reveal was Gamescom 2017. Last year they didn't even stream most stuff.</div></div><hr />

Maybe someone wants to attend a Blizzard conference, you do realize it's way harder to pay to travel to another continent right? Just cause you like watching it from home doesn't mean everyone else does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Their booth is basically the biggest for years and probably costs millions to build and maintain including tripple digit people working there.<br />
In many ways it can be seen as cutting costs since there is no major thing to promote despite running games. In retrospect last year was already a bit of a waste of time. BFA was out for 2 weeks. They presented nothing new for the other IPs and the program on stage was boring and monotone.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DesoPL</div><div class="date">2019-04-30, 05:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course they will not. <br />

HOTS will probably shut down soon.<br />
D3 and SC2 are abandoned. Yep they recieved patches but nothing more.<br />
WoW is in bad state atm. <br />
Overwatch got crisis too.<br />
For hearthstone is nothing worth to mention even. <br />

So yeah, they will focus working on more mobile games.</div></div><hr />

If they were cutting events for money, BlizzCon would have been canceled since it's well known for a while now BlizzCon incurs a loss to Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Unless you think somehow it cost Blizzard more to fund an event at another convention that they're obviously still going to have a presence at since they'll have booths selling merchandise, which I find odd that you're trying to shame like there are people going who are going to be like &quot;Ugh, Blizzard shops are here, how awful&quot;.<br />

<br />
As someone who has been to Blizzcon a lot, let me tell you, it's definitely better to watch it at home. You miss out on like at least 80-90% of the information they release by physically being there instead of watching it at home. I always have to check MMO Champion when I get home from Blizzcon because I legitimately have no idea what they've even said because I can't be present at multiple panels at the same time.<br />
<br />
You don't go to Blizzcon for information on the new expansion, you go there for the event, to meet up with people, to party, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Taliesin is known for being heavily biased towards Blizzard though so I'd not pay them any attention personally. I wouldn't pay any Youtuber when it comes to Blizzard/WoW any attention personally but that's just me.<br />
<br />
A WoW expansion will not help if they are intent on this design that is pushing players away.<br />
<br />
Overwatch is slowly dwindling and the only thing keeping it going is the League.<br />
<br />
HotS is basically in maintenance mode now with dripfeed content and the odd hero.<br />
<br />
Starcraft 2 has been left to wither and it's only feeding time is the WCS.<br />
<br />
Hearthstone seems to be in decline a bit as well as of late.<br />
<br />
As for Diablo. They basically finished it off while it was down with Immortal.<br />
<br />
They are going to need an absolute storm of a show. And personally I don't see that happening. And if they even announce 1 mobile game there they've already screwed themselves. They want to announce mobile titles? Fine but don't do it at Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Umm... that's not the quote lol. You used quotes and typed something different. They said &quot;As part of a renewed effort this year to maintain our focus on development&quot; not &quot;to do more, we will do less&quot;. <br />
<br />
I suppose one could interpret &quot;focus on development&quot; could mean more development, but based on the context I assume it to mean better development. If Blizzard games really do lack [fill in the blank], then putting more focus on fixing that via development should make you happy, not upset.<br />
<br />
Imagine you own a donut shop and lately people have been complaining about your donuts not being as good. So instead of attending different events to promote your food, you instead stay home and focus on fixing whatever has been going awry lately. Or, maybe they're fine but you just want to make them even better. Sure, one could argue &quot;nothing will change despite desperate attempts&quot;, but at least you're (Blizzard is) making a concerted effort to improve.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jester Joe</div><div class="date">2019-04-30, 05:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Whatever man. Think what you want. <br />

<br />
Because nothing you ever say in regards to this is logical.<br />
<br />
It's just pure doomsaying nonstop. Over and over, while praising another game that is going to most likely go down the same exact path 5 years from now and the same cycle will be repeated.<br />
<br />
BlizzCon HAS been canceled before in the past, twice. It has nothing to do with Activision, and whether or not Blizzard sees it as worth the publicity/marketing because that's all they get out of it. Same with this, there's nothing for them to announce so they're not going. It's as simple as that.<br />
<br />
Yet somehow again here we are with people going &quot;Oh, Blizzards dead!&quot; and then you going &quot;IT'S MONEY!&quot;.<br />
<br />
It's ridiculous. If you want to criticize Blizzard, at least have reasons besides &quot;they breathed!&quot;. It's more helpful for those who actually want to see Blizzard improve.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overwatch is slowly dwindling and the only thing keeping it going is the League.<br />
<br />
which is extremely popular.<br />
<br />
<br />
HotS is basically in maintenance mode now with dripfeed content and the odd hero.<br />
<br />
The ever odd hero Anduin.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hearthstone seems to be in decline a bit as well as of late.<br />
<br />
&quot;Seems&quot;. So literally just your gut feeling without any reasoning?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for Diablo. They basically finished it off while it was down with Immortal.<br />
<br />
Not even close to the truth considering how many people are still dying for them to reveal D4. Immortals caused outrage yes, but outrage on the internet hardly goes anywhere like that considering it's already moved onto the next topic like Anthem.</div></div><hr />

I agree he does seem to have some slight bias towards Blizzard. I do think they are going to pull out all the stops for this particular Blizzcon, though. They really pissed a lot of people off the last one.<br />

Yeah right. Nothing to do with the cost cutting these days and it was natural events were going to be on the chopping block.<br />
<br />
And please nobody wants to see your mobile stuff at Blizzcon. Save it for some lesser event. Did the Diablo Immortal reaction/shitstorm not show that?<br />
<br />
No, it has nothing to do with cost cuts. Its so sad how so many think this si the first time blizzard has cut costs, they had several over the period of wows lifetime. They are focusing on blizzcon. It was heavily hinted last year that if ever one would go to a blizzcon in their lifetime, it would be 2019.</div></div><hr />

It's just pure doomsaying nonstop. Over and over, while praising another game that is going to most likely go down the same exact path 5 years from now and the same cycle will be repeated.<br />
<br />
BlizzCon HAS been canceled before in the past, twice. It has nothing to do with Activision, and whether or not Blizzard sees it as worth the publicity/marketing because that's all they get out of it.

It's ridiculous. If you want to criticize Blizzard, at least have reasons besides &quot;they breathed!&quot;. It's more helpful for those who actually want to see Blizzard improve.<br />
<br />
Then don't respond to me if you don't think it's logical and just &quot;doomsaying&quot;. Problem solved. I sadly can't stop myself from seeing your posts as we can't ignore moderators on this site (makes sense of course) so there's not much I can do on my end.<br />
<br />
I'm critical of the state the company is in and how it's games are doing. I want it to improve. And it's not. As someone who grew up with this company with games like Brood War and Diablo 1 on the PS1 it bloody hurts to see them ruining great franchise.<br />

<br />
yeh, its part of this new social group of derps that have to validate their reason for not playing the game, and HAVE to be right for making that decision then making up excuses and spewing their toxic vitriol online.<br />

Kind of like the people who think Blizzard do no wrong then? Don't pretend it's one sided please.<br />
<br />
And no I don't wish I still played any of their current products because they've shown they lack passion, commitment and dedication to them. I want them however to get their backside in gear and start being a company for the players and not the shareholders again.<br />
<br />
The old guard were the kind of people who wanted to make games. Who would probably play a game of D&amp;D now and then as friends during or maybe after work. The new guard probably don't even know what D&amp;D is.</div></div><hr />

Don't just sit there and lambaste them for literally everything. You may not think of it as much, but honestly WoW was much more enjoyable the less I spent on these forums talking about it.

<br />
THIS situation right here should be a hopeful one. If Blizzard isn't wasting their time with Gamescom, it means they don't want to show their cards just yet. They have something down the line that isn't time to show. I'd say BlizzCon has a good chance of being impressive this year again.<br />

ok, lets say you are blizz: would u rather play all ur cards all at once to guarantee the maximum shock value at blizzcon (which will have a much bigger payoff), or would u stagger that effect and allocate money, intravenously hurting your payoff by offering something that may or may not be ready for announcement? They are def hurting from last years blizzcon, it would make sense to come back with a huge return. <br />
<br />
In short, it simply does not make sense to go to gamescon witht he current state of the companies rapport with its community. Really simple to understand. Gamescom presence would cost them pretty much pennies and would hurt potential of 2019 blizzcon as they ahve several things to announce.<br />
<br />

I kind of have two feelings about it. I understand where these people are coming from because what they did last Blizzcon was pretty upsetting. The company they are working with to produce the mobile Diablo is known for implementing ridiculous microtransactions too. It paints a pretty bad picture for Blizzard. To top it all off, the &quot;do you not have phones&quot; comment was the wrong response.<br />
<br />
At the same time, the constant doomsaying I have heard over the years is just as annoying as it was back then. It's weird.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Skulltaker</div><div class="date">2019-04-30, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Umm... that's not the quote lol. You used quotes and typed something different. They said &quot;As part of a renewed effort this year to maintain our focus on development&quot; not &quot;to do more, we will do less&quot;. <br />
<br />
I suppose one could interpret &quot;focus on development&quot; could mean more development, but based on the context I assume it to mean better development. If Blizzard games really do lack [fill in the blank], then putting more focus on fixing that via development should make you happy, not upset.<br />
<br />
Imagine you own a donut shop and lately people have been complaining about your donuts not being as good. So instead of attending different events to promote your food, you instead stay home and focus on fixing whatever has been going awry lately. Or, maybe they're fine but you just want to make them even better. Sure, one could argue &quot;nothing will change despite desperate attempts&quot;, but at least you're (Blizzard is) making a concerted effort to improve.<br />
<br />
A Donut shop is not an internationally operating multi-billion dollar company whose biggest source of income is community-dependent multiplayer games (for now) where representation and appearance is a very important part of the game. Blizzard has the money, employees, skills and experience to both attend one of the biggest press- and communityevents in gaming in the world, aswell as making an increased effort in development. Adding to this, as anybody who ever owned or worked in any developing sector, including research, design, even cooking, will tell you - exchanging experiences to gain ideas is important, and while the web will give you access to a great many different sources of information, first-hand experiencing and exchanging with different development teams is very important. That's why symposiums are a thing. These excebitions aren't only for the public and the press, they are also for the developers. <br />
<br />
And one of the biggest companies in the sector not showing up can be explained by exactly one thing. Lazyness. Nothing else. A focus on development would include looking at other peoples developments.</div></div><hr />

And when the usual suspects don't get their dopamine hits from speculation and fake leaks, well, they're gonna get their dopamine, even if it means posting cranky, pissy comments about &quot;BLIZZARD ONLY WANTS MUNNEY&quot;, &quot;ACTIVISION BAD&quot;, etc. <br />

I think this is smart move. Better to pull back and wait for Blizzcon for the big stuff rather than have an uninteresting Gamescom. I remember when all they had to show for the 2017 Gamescom was 7.3 info that we already knew for months. It was a major letdown.<br />
<br />
According to Taliesin, supposedly some of the devs were telling him if there was one Blizzcon to go see, it would be this one coming up. Hope that holds true. We all know it'll be an expac announcement.<br />
<br />
Gamescon 2018 was literally an empty stage. BFA had been out 2 weeks and they were not ready to show 8.2 or 8.1 yet so those waited till blizzcon</div></div><hr />

I do think they are going to pull out all the stops for this particular Blizzcon, though. They really pissed a lot of people off the last one.<br />
<br />
Then again, I could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Thing is last blizzcon was good, but people cry about it simply because of the daiblo immortal anoun emrnt, and while yes it was distasteful, pokemon go did not replace pokemon sword and shield, or let's go, or others, it was a spin off, like how diablo immortal is a spin off, diablo 4 is still in the making.<br />

<br />
That's pretty damning, honestly. Nothing worth/far enough along to share across all their IPs? Oof.<br />
<br />
But still selling gear in the store OFC.<br />
<br />
You do know like 80% of the booths at gamescon are companies selling mercy and that's all right..?<br />
<br />
Also what do you think would be a smarter plan for blizzard?<br />
Show off content for a convention that only about 10% of the people there care about<br />
<br />
Or wait a few weeks to show said content off at their OWN convention where 100% of the people are interested?<br />
<br />

<br />
There trying to save what they have for blizzcon. At this point I doubt that they have much to offer anymore at least for wow. SC2 might be promising if it ever announces an mmo version. Been in the works for a while just not announced yet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Not much to offer this year&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean its not like this is the expansion announcement year<br />
Or when they will announce 8.3<br />
Or launch 8.2.5 if its not already out<br />
Or talk about how wow classic is doing, and plans for its future/phase release dates.<br />
<br />
Nah nothing big for wow this year.<br />
<br />
Also a rtsmmo does not really work, so nah, also star craft players want more RTS not an mmo<br />

You didn't have any feedback about this situation.<br />
<br />
You sarcastically talked about how they're still selling things at gamescom, and to &quot;not show mobile at BlizzCon&quot;.<br />
<br />
That has nothing to do with &quot;not being at Gamescom&quot;. If you think this is such a bad decision, then let's get what you think should be done.<br />
<br />
I would reccomend putting ellecy on ignore, he has been told many times by mods to stop shilling final fantasy in all his threads, and in retaliation made his signature and avatar shilling it.<br />
If you go to my SIG you can see why I sorta stopped paying attention as he likes to make up lies that take 2 seconds to prove wrong.<br />
I even got an infraction for calling him a liar, but I won't get into that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I’m not sure what they’ll announce at Blizzcon. Will it be a new expac for WoW? 8.3? 8.2.5? Will we hear about diablo 4? Will they talk more about their move to mobile games? As long as they announce some awesome shit and make the announcements worth listening to I don’t care about gamescom.<br />
<br />
Not only that but as others have said they’ve done some announcements through streams recently. No real reason to send a bunch of people overseas if they can just announce shit on stream. Like it’s obviously not worth going to gamescom and sending a bunch of staff there for something like 8.2.5 when they can just announce it on stream.</div></div><hr />

New woe expac is due this year.<br />
8.3 will likely be there<br />
8.2.5 will either be coming out right after, or abit before, depends when 8.2 comes out, and how much content will be in 8.2.5 <br />
Diablo 4 we know is in the works so maybe<br />
Also classic wow most likely some info on &quot;what's next&quot; or a release date for the next phase.<br />
<br />
Also please add pet battles to the companion app, PvP and world quests.</div></div><hr />

It costs a lot of money to appear at these, and Blizzard is cutting costs. If they don't have anything big to show, then they won't be doing themselves any favors by wasting the money. At this point, it could also be an issue of trying to avoid more bad press, by opting for no press.<br />
<br />
They could literally use Gamescom to show their mobile stuff or smaller events.<br />
<br />
Nobody at Blizzcon went for Diablo Immortal or mobile nonsense. They wanna see big new titles like Diablo 4 or Expansions. Hell remasters are fine for Blizzcon because it's remastering the games that put Blizzard on the map.</div></div><hr />

They could, but just going to Gamescon with mobile information would be a huge waste of time. I think they understand that they will need to have the mother of all Blizzcons, or their entire label may be done for.<br />

If you don't think there aren't rumblings of Activision pulling the plug on Blizzard titles, then you are not paying attention. I know that Blizzard employees are paranoid as shit.</div></div><hr />

Then maybe throw some Hearthstone and HOTS news in. Problem solved.<br />

I'm not sure how much booth space is at Gamescon, but sending personnel alone could run hundreds of thousands of dollars. Combine that with the months of prep work, and space... that's money they decided they were not willing to spend.</div></div><hr />

Idk if ellecy knows.<br />
But blizzcon has virtual tickets<br />
Also if blizzard announced &quot;we are going to gamescon!&quot; Then a bunch of fans went, and it was just mobile games, how fucking pissed would they be? Release only hots and hearthatone and the rest of the fanbase will freak.<br />

Plus you do know the virtual ticket exists right.<br />

You make a horrible point to say &quot;just show some mobile games or something&quot; having no reason to go, is better then going and then being dissapointed.<br />
blizzard is doing it for the fans, they run blizzcon at a large loss, if not massive.<br />

Guess so. Just sucks really because ever since Activision told em to cut costs and focus on profits it feels like there's been less interaction from Blizzard or care for the fans.<br />

Just my two cents though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
also people go &quot;look at its stocks&quot; all online based companies had a crash then, people cried about how it was to do with blizzcon, but it actually started in october, as october had a major freak out in internet based companies stocks and so apple, nintendo, actiblizz, microsoft, steam, etc, all saw a large amount of falling for a few months after.<br />
<br />
Since march the stocks have actually began to rise again, slowly but steadily, small dips here and there but... that is how stocks work.<br />
the big cliff face you seep eople go &quot;oh look backlash from immortal&quot; was actually awhile after blizzcon and was cause of the profit call, which was not as &quot;omfg we are billionaires instantly&quot; as some share holders like from games, they love stuff like fortnite and minecraft which start small them fucking skyrocket.</div></div><hr />

Yes, they are, because the fans are pissed. It's hard to put lipstick on a pig month after month. There's also a possibility that the people who got canned, were the ones who were going to be doing the Gamescon pieces, I simply do not know.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has long wanted their convention to be the center, and they may be going back to that. They may have nothing big to offer, and don't want the nuclear shitstorm of having another failed convention. And I can promise you, Blizzard employees know that Blizzcon was a fucking train wreck of epic proportions. This isn't about a company not engaging with fans, this is a company that may not have a 5-year plan that involves them having more than 1-2 active titles.</div></div><hr />

also idk if you know<br />
but you dont go to blizzcon for the announcments, those are better viewed online as you can view everything instead of just 1 at a time, and you can actually hear and see whats going on over the crowd.<br />
you go for the convention, meeting friends, content creators, the experiance, the sights, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are supposed to run at a loss, it's advertising dollars. They are willing to incur that cost, when they think it will help their bottom line overall. That's not the case if they don't have anything to offer. The only thing worse than having no convention, is having a fucking terrible one. People forgave them for the ones that they decided not to have. <br />
<br />
When Blizzard told people they were going to delay something, people were understanding. When Blizzard put out shitty content... not s much. They have put out so much shitty content, that they can no longer afford to fall back on their reputation... because they no longer have a solid one. The bottom line is simple, they are not a AAA developer, and haven't been one for a while. HotS and Overwatch were 5 years behind the curve. Hearthstone is but a blip, and WoW is a joke.<br />

The thing is they and Activision are having a record time.<br />
<br />
Feels a bit crappy imo to brag about record profits then downsize employees. (The whole 800 thing across both companies).</div></div><hr />

How do you think they get those profits? By cutting costs. Usage and subs are down, so they cut costs, and milk the devoted fan base for more per person than before. They are the Chinese gold farmers now. They are EA.</div></div><hr />

The old guard were the kind of people who wanted to make games. Who would probably play a game of D&amp;D now and then as friends during or maybe after work. The new guard probably don't even know what D&amp;D is.<br />

You are basically a cartoon character troll at this point, and your opinion doesn't matter anymore.<br />

<br />
I agree with this, but I honestly don't see it being the case. There is very little information other than &quot;We have more things in development than ever&quot; and “Many of us have shifted many of our game playing hours as we’ve gotten older and had children,” he says. “I play a ton of games still. Half my time played now is on PC and console, while the other half may be in the evenings with my family. Sitting in bed my wife watches cooking shows and I’ll be playing whatever mobile game I’m most excited about. That’s a common pattern at Blizzard.<br />
<br />
To me, those comments scream; &quot;We're heading in a casual friendly, mobile friendly direction.&quot; which just isn't the direction the core audience seems to want things to go. It seems like, in their in house echo chamber, that's the direction people want to go, but the core customers clearly don't and have been more than vocal about how they don't want cash grab phone games, they want the core values of Blizzard, the ones that made great games that have lasted for years. More importantly, they want PC games.<br />
<br />
I think it's a safe bet to assume that this year is going to go like this for Blizzcon; Starcraft Mobile game announcement, WoW expansion announcement / 8.3 (maybe 8.4) content discussion, Diablo 4, another whatever its called (Basically a please buy more packs announcement) for Hearthstone, and a character reveal for Overwatch (maybe HoTs too). <br />
<br />
I feel like they could hop on the battle royale bandwagon and maybe announce a game along those lines across all of Blizzard's IPs, but even that I think would be stretching it.</div></div><hr />

Blizzcons aren't JUST about new things. There are the panels, eSports, other games, and the costume contest. It's also about social gatherings, partying, and the rest of the activities, like meeting devs and guildmates and everything else. Outside of the Diablo fiasco, most people seemed to have had a good time. But if you force the entire event through a filter of &quot;no new announcements&quot;, then yeah, you might have a manufactured issue to gripe about. <br />
<br />
If ALL you care about is reveals and big announcements, then I'd suggest unplugging from the Blizzard universe until Blizzcon, at the very least.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is there's usually ONE good thing to talk about from most Blizzcons in terms of the overall playerbase. Whether that be new story reveals, new patch details, new systems, rework of old systems, SOME kind of window into the Dev world that says &quot;Here's what's new and exciting that's coming in the future.&quot;<br />
<br />
2018 Blizzcon was a lot of promises that good things were coming - And a whole lot of nothing to prove it. In an effort to keep the story of BFA a secret, we got almost no story details for the upcoming patches, only reveals of the major players. We got no new details on upcoming class changes. We got no details on old systems being reworked. We got no new systems in ANY of the blizzard games. And let's not even talk about the Dev Q&amp;As that nobody is satisfied with since they won't answer any of the actually good questions that are plaguing the expansion.<br />
<br />
If the people who paid to go to Blizzcon had fun, great for them - But Blizzcon stopped being just about the congoers when they decided to stream everything online to all of their players. Now there's an expectation that the playerbase will see something when they watch - And this Blizzcon, they got absolutely nothing but Diablo Mobile, and &quot;Don't you guys have phones???&quot;</div></div><hr />

So, I guess you can find a reason to complain, if you shove it around to the right angle, I guess? <br />

Is this your way of saying &quot;You're right, that's a valid reason to be upset with Blizzard about Blizzcon 2018?&quot;<br />
<br />
Because it is. I'm glad the people who pay $550 just for the ticket are getting their money's worth - That'd be a really bad thing if they weren't, and I'd be standing with them if they were upset about it - But I'm not someone who's going to spend that kind of money and won't pretend I ever was.<br />
<br />
But given that Blizzcon isn't just marketted to the congoers anymore, it's absolutely valid that the people who ALSO paid to watch what is being shown, get their money's worth. Maybe that means they stop doing the virtual pass - That way they have no obligation to please those not at the con. The info gets released immediately online anyway, so it's not like it'll make any difference to those who did buy it aside from an extra few bucks in their pocket.</div></div><hr />

Yeah right. Nothing to do with the cost cutting these days and it was natural events were going to be on the chopping block.<br />

And please nobody wants to see your mobile stuff at Blizzcon. Save it for some lesser event. Did the Diablo Immortal reaction/shitstorm not show that?<br />

Highly unlikely Blizzard would release major content updates, expansion announcements, upcoming games at a con that’s not their own, let alone one so close to the other.<br />
That said, demos and friendly competition booths would have been cool, but I have no idea how much that would have cost them as a company to have something so minor to give to fans.

<br />
Going to conventions takes resources and staff, some of which was cut in the bloodletting a few months back. It is a positive in my book that they are taking the hit and not going to gamescom and re-focusing on the base. Focusing on the development of games and frankly Blizzcon matters.<br />
<br />
Blizzard needs an epic Blizzcon to get itself off the mat and focused going forward. It makes perfect sense to save everything for a major home court event.

I think they did announce an expansion at a gamescon, and based on timing they probably will be focused on 8.2.5 at that time and not ready to discuss 8.3. My guess is they will only do major content stuff in controlled editable environments like their 8.2 twitch thing.

If they did then that is my mistake. I’m under the impression they reserve those announcements for their own convention. Memory is a faulty thing though and I could be completely wrong.<br />

The department that took the biggest hit by the Blizzard layoffs was IT, which lost 41 employees. Marketing and Live Experiences lost 29 employees each, followed by a global insight department.
