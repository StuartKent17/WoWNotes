Patch 4.3 Pets and Mounts Update&lt;script&gt;$(function () { ttlib.init(); })&lt;/script&gt;<br />
Blizzard released a nice guide (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/4023608) to the different companion pets and mounts that were added in Patch 4.3, allowing us to finish updating almost all of our pages. <br />
<br />
They don't seem to mention the Heart of the Aspects (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78924/heart-of-the-aspects/), Soul of the Aspects (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/78916/soul-of-the-aspects/), Spectral Gryphon (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/76889/spectral-gryphon/), and Spectral Wind Rider (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/76902/spectral-wind-rider/), so their locations remain unknown.<br />

More Tokens in LFR vs Normal Raids<br />
LFR gear is less powerful than standard gear, and the groups performing those raids don't have any kind of organized loot distribution system to ensure that raid members receive a 'fair share'.<br />
<br />
Of course, between your Normal or Heroic raids, you can jump into an LFR to shore up the weak points in your gear load out. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/207466/2-tokens-on-normal-25-man-raid) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3657606304?page=1#4))<br />
<br />
Firelands Nerf<br />
We're looking into the issue with Rhyolith randomly becoming friendly during some encounters. As far as his movement speed is concerned, the animation was changed in patch 4.3 a little bit. He appears to be moving slower, but his speed has not actually changed. We had our QA team verify this to make sure it is just an issue of perception.<br />
<br />
Things like Fandral's Flame Scythe and Alysrazor's tornadoes have not been adjusted since our hotfixes in September.<br />
<br />
We did remove Magma Geyser from phase 4 of the Heroic Ragnaros encounter. The reasoning behind this change wasn't so much to make the fight easier, but rather because the mechanic just wasn't really playing out the way we wanted it to.<br />
<br />
The intent of the mechanic was indeed to require the raid to take turns cycling through the Breadths of Frost to reset their Superheated stacks, and to destroy the Breadth if too many people tried to camp in it at once. As it turned out, players discovered that a very, very precise triangle formation allowed three independent clumps to coexist inside the Breadth without triggering Geyser. All of the initial Heroic Ragnaros kills used this tactic and it became the standard way of doing the fight.<br />
<br />
We could have increased the detection radius that triggered Geyser, but in general we try to avoid enacting changes that make an encounter more difficult once that fight has already been defeated. Doing so creates a frustrating experience for players who have to relearn something they believed they had mastered. The adjustments to the health and damage of Ragnaros and his minions in September primarily affected the difficulty of phases 1-3 of the encounter; at that time, we also decided that Magma Geyser should be removed from phase 4, but the change was not one that could be made in a straightforward way via hotfix, so it did not take effect until the 4.3 patch.<br />
<br />
So basically, yes, it’s a nerf, but it’s because we weren’t happy with the mechanic and the only two solutions for fixing that were to either make the fight harder or to make it easier. And, as stated above, we try to avoid making fights harder once they’ve gone live.<br />
<br />
Despite some of the insinuations in this thread, the change isn’t remotely going to let a guild that hasn’t mastered the encounter just walk in and defeat it. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/207653/fl-nerfed-again) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3657436442?page=1#8))<br />
<br />
Faction Bias<br />
We recognize that struggle is necessary. We, the Alliance, want the struggle. We want the conflict. We want the fight. We want the hardship.<br />
<br />
I think you're speaking for yourself here, because dozens of capped threads have been made on the exact points Dave brought up, and you claim no one is concerned with. I can appreciate if you don't believe those things are important, but many people obviously do, and so they were mentioned in the article. If that's all you took away from what was said though, I'd recommend taking a second read-through.<br />
<br />
Of course, the proof is in the pudding as they say, so I don't expect anyone to get super excited over us just saying it's going to get better. We'll have to do the work and make it happen, and I can't really offer you anything other than a request that you take a wait and see approach.

<br />
Conquest Points<br />
Conquest points you've earned from Random Battlegrounds after the 4.3 patch was applied shouldn't be going anywhere. It wasn't intended for Arenas or Rated BGs to be available again until the start of Season 11, so those points were wiped intentionally. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/207654/conquest-points) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3657276764?page=2#21))<br />
<br />
Classic Gear and Transmogrification<br />
In the case of the old Honor system it’s no longer available like Molten Core is. We know who participated, what they achieved, when, and we can in this instance restrict those specific items (some of which were arguably more difficult to obtain than any raid has ever been) to the people that earned them when the system existed. It’s also worth noting that people's time investments, even at level 85 and going back and doing these old raids over and over to build a full set, is not inconsequential. It's not accurate to compare raid item drop rates (regardless of character level) now, to current honor gains and their comparison to the original honor ranking system.<br />
<br />
We do agree that the restriction to the specific characters that earned those titles kind of sucks. It’s the player that earned those items, really, not any specific character. If we had a way to make them account-wide right now, we would. We can’t, but account-wide achievements are planned for Mists of Pandaria, and we hope to be able to include Feats of Strength with that system, which would open up these items to all characters on that player's account.<br />
<br />
It's also worth reiterating the point made in the original reply I made &quot;while keeping the door open to reward them to more people in the future.&quot; We'd like to find ways to make these items available to players who didn't earn them through the original system, while keeping them prestigious for those that did.<br />
<br />
Lastly I want to apologize that this restriction was not communicated before the patch was released. As much we hope to be in front of messaging any changes before they're implemented to ensure you're well informed and can plan your play schedule with these things in mind, it doesn't always happen. For that we are sorry if anyone was looking forward to using these items for transmogrification and is unable to do so.

<br />
Level 60 PVP Gear and Transmogrification<br />
As you can all see, it is our intention at this current point to only allow access to this gear for Transmogrification to those that received the privilege of wearing it in classic WoW. This may not be permanent though, as stated there is still a door there for us to be able to unlock and let other players access it as well at a later date.<br />
<br />
We hope that you are all enjoying the new Transmogrification feature though as its great to reminisce by using old gear.

So that's what? 1% of the current player base, maybe less? To wear some of the armour that most represents this 'Faction Pride' Blizzard so dearly wants us to feel and experience? Good job Blizzard; as Thane Korthazz would say, What a bloody waste this is!</div></div><hr />

There are also many buggy mobs in Firelands atm, particularly the large fire elemental on the way to fight Rag.. the safe spots between the lava weren't always.. well.. safe. On a happier not though I love the changes/fixes to fire mages, so happy not to be forced into monotonous arcane spec on nearly every encounter.</div></div><hr />

But you will still hang around here and bitch about the game? Maybe you have some trouble letting go little boy, but by the fact you call MoP kfp, im not suprised you couldnt handle the game anymore. As you clerarly cant tell the difference between a game and a movie....<br />
<br />
And as for swtor. It will hang in there for a little longer then Rift, ill give you that. But it will fail like the others before it, The only reason that it might just hang in there is because it reminds so damn much about WoW. Dont get me wrong tho, WoW will eventually die (not omg only 10M subscribers die, but the 0 subscribers death), in the far future. It will be replaced by a new game like Titan. But not swtor mate, not a chance in hell.</div></div><hr />

No, it wasn't - it used to discount every multi-shot you could spam without waiting for the next wave to hit, but this was not the case on wednesday. However yesterday I did FL and it was back to the old behavior so probably (hopefully) it's reverted, because it was a royal pain.</div></div><hr />

I agree Irishman. To restrict the older gear sets is a tremendously bad decision on Blizzards part, especially in lieu of the relative age of these sets. It's most likely that even less than 1% of the total player base would be able to xmog these pieces into current gear. This should have also been announced as soon as the decision was made.

I'm almost positive there's a new raid out that's supposed to be the main focus and not Firelands. Not sure though, hold on, let me go check...yup, totally a new raid out. I think it's called Dragon Soul or something.</div></div><hr />

Loving wearing my 60 pvp gear again personally, if you wern't around to know what we went through to reach these ranks then you won't understand how nice it is to get something unique from it.. Just like the ivory raptor it should stay retired to reward some of the veterans</div></div><hr />

Because you can predict the future. Ignorance is rampant on these forums. And for the record, SWTOR is purposefully limiting the number of players at launch to keep queues down and improve game play; something wow didn't do. So don't come back and cry victory when the subcriptions aren't 10 mil immediately...<br />
<br />
MoP vs KFP. People can tell the difference. It's the fact that the two are so similar that's the problem. The fact that you can't see it or refuse to see it just shows how much of a Blizzard fanboy you are. Good for their business model though. Maybe the expansion after MoP will have talking green Ogres for you...</div></div><hr />

That made me laugh hard, I feel the same as you.<br />
<br />
I've raided since TBC and every patch, every expansion they make the game even more faceroll... just look how hard Deathwing is in normal... facerolling the last boss in the expansion in the first week.<br />
<br />
The game gets shitter and shitter day by day, I saw on the front cover of PC Gamer magazine &quot;World of Warcraft: Mists of Pandaria - Saving WoW from extinction&quot; Quite ironic as it will ruin the game for me, from a horde point of view a Panda race has no place in our faction.<br />
<br />
I hate how wow has turned from such an epic game to a kindergarten atmosphere, where people throw their dummy out of the pram and Blizzard nerfs content like no tomorrow in response to a minority of people who aren't prepared to have a challenge.<br />
<br />
The game used to have alot of things for players to do, alot of things that were challenging, fun and some that required dedication and a sense of community. Nowadays world pvp is dead, the server community is dead, you do dungeons, raids, battlegrounds with people you have never met rather than people on your server, you spend all day playing with absolute dick heads who judge your skill on your item level and achievement even though you could probably rape them all on boss fights.<br />
<br />
I am so angry with this patch, they have actually ruined one of my favourite games, It’s been going downhill for ages but I feel it has reached a point of no return.<br />
<br />
This game won’t last another 5 years because they will lose a big chunk of their playerbase, I know there won’t be a game that will have such an impact on the company but with every new game that comes out they will just lose more and more subscribers. They will end up having to shut down servers to save money , downgrade customer support etc just to keep making a profit, create more services such as class change and eventually sell gold and items to people at the right price. Blizzard are blinded by profit, Mike Morhaime created the company to deliver great games and since then they have been blinded by the $$$$$$$$$$$ revenues.<br />
<br />

Just an idea, maybe you're playing it for too long already ?<br />
You know, at some point games just get old, no matter what you do. In addition the veterans are getting better over time which makes it look easier.<br />
Maybe ?<br />

Actually I liked the MoP preview, I only dislike the dual faction Pandas. Ogres for the horde, they are as fat as the pandas and would be great monks. ^^<br />

That's not new. I already know all of that from WotLK in one way or another.<br />

Nobody can live from passion alone. They need to make money and it's a hard business by the way. I'd really wonder if WoW would make it another 5 years. The paying system is just too out of date and I think thats what bothers people. There are good mmos for free and Blizz could do it too, but players have to pay fully for each addon, for each month and for each extra service. I am not surprised that players are getting dissapouinted by content, graphics, stories, patches and the whole game. <br />
I'd say, the game is ok, but not for this prize.<br />
<br />
Im off dreaming of Ogre monks. ^^</div></div><hr />

Pretty much sums up what is wrong with the current &quot;design philosophy&quot; of the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just how is Kung Fu Panda so similar to MoP? I want to know because I have seen Kung Fu Panda and from my understanding the story of MoP is completely different than that of Kung Fu Panda. I am not saying they don't have similar points but those are few if you count them:<br />
<br />
1. Pandas<br />
2. Fat Pandas<br />
3. Kung Fu Fat Pandas<br />
4. Asian theme with Kung Fu Fat Pandas<br />
5. Colorful Asian theme with Kung Fu Fat Pandas<br />
(I know I am missing more points somewhere.)<br />
<br />
It is okay to hate on Blizzard because in the words of Katt Williams everyone needs one hater because &quot;You need haters to make you stronger…without haters most people wouldn't try to become better.&quot; But come on people lets hate with in reason.</div></div><hr />

For the record, I don't hate Blizzard. I played wow for nearly 7 years before cancelling for SWTOR. I actually think the Monk class was a long time coming. I just saw MoP and I'm not excited about it. The similarities are Martial Arts Pandas and an Asian theme which you mentioned. There's probably a lot more once you get into it but I haven't played the new expansion so I don't know. What I do know is those two similarities are huge in the grand scheme of things. It's not that it's a bad thing, it's just Blizzard needed a home run after Cataclysm and with a couple of new MMO's coming out. MoP is not it given what they've released already. Burning Crusade, Wrath and to a lesser degree Cataclysm had original ideas. MoP's main themes are not. It's because wow could be so much better that players get frustrated and quit. All those millions of dollars wasted... kinda like our tax dollars... :cool:</div></div><hr />
