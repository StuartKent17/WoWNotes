Legion Class Preview - Demon Hunter<br />
Demon Hunters aren't getting an official class preview with the latest series of blog posts so we thought now would be a good time to recap what we know so far (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1515-Legion-Demon-Hunter). Some of the information came from the gameplay stream below. <br />
<br />
It's fairly long and the front page is already pretty full, so we put it on it's own page. You can find it in the Legion menu in future!<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Will you guys be putting thought into things like Gladiator and Fistweaving as potential 4th specs?<br />
It's definitely an interesting idea that we'll consider for the future, but for Legion we're focusing on the current 36 specs (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665342970040684545))<br />

Any current plans for Death Knights Presences in Legion expansion, or do they remain a same?<br />
Presences have been removed. They were mostly clutter, and negatively impacted gameplay when off-role Presences were used. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665342665530081281))<br />

Will Restoration Druids have Genesis in Legion? I love Genesis, especially for Challenge Modes.<br />
Genesis has been removed. Instead, Flourish and the new Mastery will help in similar situations. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665343467480944641))<br />

Will we get an updated Aspect of the Pack for Legion? I hate having to find the forgetful hunter and tell him to turn it off<br />
Aspect of the Pack will no longer bother you in Legion... (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665345157244456960))<br />

Wait, is Glyph of Regenerative Ice going away in Legion now that major glyphs are going away? Don't take our only self-heal <br />
Mages should focus on avoiding/absorbing damage. We don't like self-healing for them. Instead, we made Ice Barrior class-wide. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665341966876479488))<br />
<br />
Will the mage specs be more balanced in Legion? In WoD Fire was basically AoE only &amp; bad for single target (e.g. most of HFC)<br />
Previously, we favored some AoE niches between specs. We'll be toning that down for Legion. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665343195098705924))<br />

With Elusive Brew gone, what will Brewmasters use Crit for defensively?<br />
We're still discussing exactly what it'll be, but are going to ensure that Brewmasters still value Crit. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665340986009096192))<br />
<br />
Clarification on the brew master keg? Is it just just the one on the end of the artifact staff or an actual keg?<br />
Yes, the one on the staff. The base artifact's keg is a small bottle, but the alternate visuals have a much larger keg, like Chen. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665345574258913280))<br />

Will Light of the Martyr heal the caster if they have Beacon on them?<br />
Yes. It's likely to be less healing than the self-damage it deals, but it does work. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665342160225472512))<br />

Say we have a Lei Shen transition phase. Healing to be done, but not really anything to attack. Do you see Disc being useful?<br />
In these rare situations, Disc would use pure healing spells. It's less effective, but far from useless. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665342434625220608))<br />

About CP wasting for rogues. Anticipation is a huge help, but it feels like something like it should be baseline. Any plans?<br />
Not planning to make Anticipation baseline. Minimizing wasted CP is a core Rogue mechanic. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665341278222061568))<br />
That said, we definitely recognize the ease of use it provides, so the other talent options need to be strong to compete. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665341354155773952))<br />

Could it be possible to allow Ele shamans Lava Burst precasting? So the dmg increase applies on hit and not casting? Please.<br />
Possibly. Nuances like that will be evaluated in beta. Important to consider the reverse: casting LvB just before FS expires. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665344240365408256))<br />
<br />
Will Healing Surge still be instant after some MSW build-up for Enhancement? Would absolutely suck if not.<br />
We're still evaluating that. It currently costs a variable amount of Maelstrom (0 to 20). May affect healing, cast time, or both. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665344644138401792))<br />

I keep hearing a lot about executes being mostly removed outside of Warriors. Will Doomguard's Doom Bolt still have execute?<br />
Still evaluating. We're most sensitive to abilities which are only usable at low target health. Doom Bolt is different. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665340519736709120))<br />
<br />
Does Dark Soul still exist for Warlocks in Legion?<br />
No. Instead, Doomguards and Infernals will be on much shorter cooldowns, and possibly stronger, to fulfill the same role. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665344454375505921))<br />

Not sure if this has been answered but, What about SMF for Fury warriors? I like using 1H's specially fist weaopns<br />
Fury will strongly prefer 2H in Legion. We'll make sure you have appropriate weapons when the time comes. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665340815535792128))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Will number of valor upgrades for 6.2.3 be the same for all regions? Last time they were different.<br />
All regions have two upgrades. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665290300177297408))<br />
<br />
are the new CMs going to have a mob count requirement or are stealth runs back in business?<br />
Yes. Kill count requirements are necessary to prevent shenanigans, but stealth is still a useful tool. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665300716060213248))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Will honor and conquest points get wiped with the new season?<br />
Yes, Conquest will be converted to Honor. All Honor over 4000 will be converted to silver at a rate of 35 silver per Honor. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665283947119570945))<br />
<br />
UI / Addons<br />
simple ui request: option to outline my character (like you can with target and mouseover). increase raid visibility of toon.<br />
Done! A toggleable self-highlight for improved raid visibility is one of Legion's UI improvements. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/665300937498464259))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
wasn't the PTR for WoW the same sort of thing? or any game, really. Never quite done adjusting and tuning things.<br />
Raid testing on PTR was fairly good data because those teams had an incentive to try hard. PTR PvP feedback was never good data. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/661667489374298116))<br />
<br />
Still weird for me to see the WoW panel without Stockton, Chilton, Metzen or Ghostcrawler <br />
I think it's great that they're letting some of the other team heroes get some face time. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/662767256842076160))<br />
<br />
I'm sad they didn't announce any additions to the Black Market, how do you feel about the system? I hope for Naxx-40 weapons<br />
I loved the black market. It was something I worked on personally at a time when it was hard to keep my hand dirty implementing. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/664268836774875136))<br />

Arms got butchered. Friend is unhappy about Hunter. She is SV currently, and they're straight up removing it.<br />
So it's cool to see them trying to excite players with bold innovation, even if it's too bold for some players. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/663729288542228481))<br />
I only forgave you last week for removing perma tree form in Cata. <br />
I mentioned this a few weeks ago, but is the druid fantasy a shapeshifter or an alt form class? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/664268588224638976))<br />
Clarifying, do you mean should it shape-shift across all it's forms vs. stick to just one per spec, or?<br />
That's right. It was clear that players had different opinions and was difficult to deliver on a design that met both. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/664445283351171072))<br />

I don't see why a character with a magical spirit beast (or even with another beast with regenerative abilities) couldn't expect some healing, or why a rugged survivalist couldn't patch up their own field wounds. It's really a judgment call as far as the fantasy is concerned, although it's worth noting that the in-game fantasy of hunter healing through spirit bond pre-dates any self-healing from mages or rogues.<br />
<br />
Practically speaking, the choice is whether they want to add avoidance/absorption or healing. It's not like the answer is going to be, &quot;those guys just die faster than everyone else,&quot; so if hunter/rogue self healing gets removed, then they'll just avoid/absorb more of it. It's not clear people want to see that either.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, lets see. DS is a DK-themed take on warrior spell reflect with moderate value in PVP and occasional value in PVE. It doesnt skew spec balancing at all. The presences when shiftable rather than just being baked in spec traits, create effects that dont fit with the spec and skew the balance tuning done for all 3 specs. Seems pretty obvious that their decision wasnt random.</div></div><hr />

That's what we're talking about. They were always full so in trade you would see &quot;no dks&quot;. Not because people hated them, because there were too many and the raid already had a couple. Which is what will happen to demon hunters.</div></div><hr />

We used to say back days that everyone has his DK. Battlegrounds were like ping-pong - literally every DK gripped the victim to himself and imagine what was happening when there were like 20 DKs in one team on AV. Arenas were awful because of keyboard turning DKS on 2400 mmr.</div></div><hr />

It's really a judgment call as far as the fantasy is concerned, although it's worth noting that the in-game fantasy of hunter healing through spirit bond pre-dates any self-healing from mages or rogues.<br />
<br />
Practically speaking, the choice is whether they want to add avoidance/absorption or healing. It's not like the answer is going to be, &quot;those guys just die faster than everyone else,&quot; so if hunter/rogue self healing gets removed, then they'll just avoid/absorb more of it. It's not clear people want to see that either.<br />
<br />
Well, depending on which fantasy background is taken into account, mages can either be excellent healers, or have no heals at all. While pure combat classes like warriors, rogues and rangers/hunters usually don't have any heals at all. When in doubt, I would give mages self-heal while cutting it from physical damage classes. <br />
<br />
Gutting caster mobility across the board also hurts the mage, the only clothie without self healing. I would expect that caster abilities should hit harder then, but meh, does not look like that. Let's hope that they will at least boost mage avoidance. A reduced CD on Ice Barrier and Ice Block would be helpful. :/</div></div><hr />
