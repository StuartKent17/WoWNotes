To coincide with the upcoming new talents and mechanic changes for classes in the next patch, we are making some adjustments in existing raid content to provide a smooth transition when the upcoming patch is released. The creatures and bosses in raid dungeons that were introduced in The Burning Crusade will have their health reduced, and most will have their standard melee damage output reduced as well, but their spell and ability damage are not being changed. These changes are being made in all raid dungeons from Karazhan to Sunwell Plateau as well as the outdoor encounters of Doom Lord Kazzak and Doomwalker. On top of this Illidan is also doing his part and will stop casting Shear on players.</div></div><hr />

You guys need to get some realistic perspective....without a massive nerf, most of the Sunwell fights and alot of the BT fights would be unkillable on live in 3.0.2<br />
<br />
Get your head out of your DPS and ask your healers how bad the downraking nerf and pot nerf and shadow priest regen nerf are going to hurt them.<br />
<br />
i'll bet you you'll get a resounding &quot;thank god they nerfed the encounters to be 30% faster&quot; answer from ALL of them.<br />
<br />
Remember Shamans go OOM in 3 minutes when casting max rank Chain heal and that is on live now....there's a reason shamans spam CH3 and CH4....it's so they can actually, you know, cast for the 6 minutes it takes to down Brutalius?<br />
<br />
I have my doubts than any healer could make it the 12-18 minutes it takes to down Illidan for most guilds.<br />
<br />
Then we have reliquary where there is a mana drain that's going to be even worse since most paladins and shamans downrank in that phase as the tanks don't take the damage max rank FoL/HL heals for, and shamans OOM long before the zero mana timer even hits if you spam rank 5.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Next patch you.... <br />
<br />
-cant stack shamans for bloodlust/heroism chains <br />
-can only pot 1 maybe 2 during a fight <br />
-cant chain drums <br />
-cant stack shadowpriests for mana regen<br />
<br />
These changes make sense<br />
<br />
edit: and its only for max 4 resets, then you are off to Northrend. So your QQ is meaningless</div></div><hr />

<br />
buffs have changed, without the buff stacking that existed before 3.0 raid dps will of gone down.<br />
<br />
downranking nerfed, so healers will go oom faster.<br />
<br />
a lot of classes will have screwy dps and/or efficency due to stuff being balanced for 80 and specs being weird as your effectively missing 10 talent points.<br />
<br />
also did the pot nerf go ahead or not? as that will have a big effect too.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they should retune the fights a little better then.<br />

You're probably right, though other factors like raid size (25 man), low quality players (clickers, keyboard turners), and schedule requirements (4 hour raids) may play a part.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wymorence</div><div class="date">2008-10-02, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">With the new raid buffing setup (which I personally hate, it makes my Fury warrior pretty much worthless except for damage), something had to change in the old TBC content as patch 3.0.x comes out finally. Also, Blizzard themselves stated they weren't happy that Naxx got so few visitors back when it was introduced, and therefor brought it over to WotLK as a Karazhan-like entry raid dungeon so that everyone could take a trip through the 4 wings of horror. I'd imagine that since a fair amount of BT was based on buffs, Shield Block (Illidan), and lag, they opted to do this with the last patch of TBC to see if more guilds couldn't encounter Illidan and his cronies before WotLK. Same with Sunwell.<br />
<br />
It seems a bit silly honestly, to create content that only about 20% of the playerbase will ever see. Granted yes there shouldn't be pugs running around killing the king of Outland obviously, but it should be a lot more open to the guilds who aren't &quot;ZOMG RAID EVERYDAY, SLEEP FOR WEAK!!!11!1one!&quot; than some of BT and Hyjal currently are (and don't get me started about SWP's little doorman, he hits like a freaking truck).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Theprophecy2186</div><div class="date">2008-10-02, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Shear was taken off B/c of the Shield Block mechanic change. If you don't know anything about tanking, STFU and stop blameing Blizz. Shear was cast on the main tank normally every 15-20seconds and a Tank had to make sure Shield Block was up in order to avoid it. Since Shield block is being changed to a 40 second CD and the use is different as well, they can't very well have an ability out there used by Illidan that focuses on a tanking ability THAT DOESNT EXIST ANYMORE. Yes the fight required some tanking skill before and now requires a little less, but it was a needed change, otherwise there would be NO MORE ILLIDAN KILLS. <br />

You probaly chainpot and/or have a spriest mana-battery in your group allowing you to spam chain heal at max rank. This won't be possible in lich king, hence the &quot;nerfing&quot; of the tbc bosses' health pool</div></div><hr />

You've had ages to do this. The fact is, this patch officially marks the end of TBC. That's why it has 3.x at the start. Most probably, they're trying to avoid what happened with Naxx at the end, where disabling of addons brought the whole thing down. This time, they're changing how stuff like mana regen works, hit rating, buff stacking, etc. They'd be fools to NOT reduce the health on bosses while doing so. 30% maybe a little much, but it's needed on some bosses more than others, and personally, i'd rather they carefully tune NEW bosses (you know, the 3.x bosses) than spend ages re-tuning the old ones which no-ones gonna do after 4 resets anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What you said is either a) true, or b) he's lying.<br />
<br />
It's really that simple. *Shamans don't chain spam max rank Chain Heal in sunwell without massive support. *It's a quite well documented fact. *By far and large from what I read, the Twins fight requires many to downrank all the way to CH2 from CH5. (no personal experience beyond wipefests at Felmyst to 3%)<br />

I guess maybe he isn't spamming his healing....but then that would make him by far and large the exception shaman.</div></div><hr />

Okay... For both of the people that have asked why I posted this: Are you going to honestly sit there and expect Blizzard not to nerf the drops either? Come on! Think about this logically... You'd have everyone going after the re-tuned mobs and bosses and and you see dozens of people running around with items they truly didn't earn... The reason the legendary items are so legendary is because you have to have put in so much work and blood, sweat, tears, and frustration to get those items... Only the top guilds and players in the game deserve to have those items... Re-tuned mobs and bosses lose that feel...

There is no work, blood, and sweat about getting a lucky Warglaive drop (although there is tears and frustration when one does not drop)<br />

Actually the work, blood, sweat and tears I am referring to is the number of times people, who were lucky enough to get this far, had to endure to even fight Illidian or any of the &quot;end-game&quot; bosses... And then when it does drops... How many of those same people who lost the roll on the item, had to come back again and hoped it would drop... <br />

The Fact is they are not changing any game play of any of the bosses besides their life.So that means you still have to be skilled enough to not step in the &quot;fire cakes&quot; or volcanoes of death or any other mind tinglers that might be added to any of the bosses in the game...<br />

If you don't know anything about tanking, STFU and stop blameing Blizz. Shear was cast on the main tank normally every 15-20seconds and a Tank had to make sure Shield Block was up in order to avoid it. Since Shield block is being changed to a 40 second CD and the use is different as well, they can't very well have an ability out there used by Illidan that focuses on a tanking ability THAT DOESNT EXIST ANYMORE. Yes the fight required some tanking skill before and now requires a little less, but it was a needed change, otherwise there would be NO MORE ILLIDAN KILLS. <br />
<br />
Hey at least all the bears and pally tanks can tank him now.<br />
<br />
<br />
*cough* I've tanked illy 9 of the last 12 kills. All you need is enough avoidance to avoid or block the shear, which is actually easier for a pally than it is for a warrior. I'll grant you that it means bears can tank him now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You realise it's actually fairly easy to go with a click-keybind combo AND turn with your mouse? It's even easier as a paladin that doesn't have a direction requirement for Judgement. And with Avengers shield, you only have to make a bit of room between you and the target to be able cast it, especially as you want to be slightly away from them just so it doesn't get interrupted as much. Next patch, it'll be instant so no interrupts.<br />
<br />
But this thread ain't about clicking vs keybinding, it's about boss nerfs.<br />
<br />
Many of these are essential; Illidan (Shield Block)...erm...that's really the only one i can think of. However, it allows more people to see more content. Those struggling on Brutallus (such as the guild i'm in. We either get good healing and not enough dps, or Vice Versa) will be able to see M'uru or even KJ. Those starting in BT will be able to see Illidan, and maybe even the start of SWP. Kalecgos hits pretty hard, and even post nerf, he'll still require the tactics, just the tanks will take less damage, especially during enrage.<br />
<br />
I DON'T approve of nerfing fights unjustly (think &quot;Wow, illidan dead again, whoopee..../sarcasm&quot;), but since it's the last weeks of TBC (thank god it's almost over tbh), i do approve of having S**T loads of fun! I wanna see more than Kalecgos, as i'm sure those who haven't done KJ too will want to see more.<br />
<br />
Overall, a good change and one i feel will only really effect us for the last few weeks, and at 80 when we start doing &quot;old-world-TBC&quot; raids for the hell of it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah I agree with what you said... Remember what happened to the old world dungeons after TBC came out... Now noone goes to them, except for achievements and the events, like Brewfest... By the time this is all set and done, the items will be worthless... And everyone will be after the Lv 80 items...</div></div><hr />

I am not make up anything... Now I will apologize to those who feel that I was make things up if you interpretted that way... I am just stating an opinion... If you wanna go QQ about it... Fine... But face the facts... They will nerf the mobs and bosses... Whether they nerf the items or not is yet to be determined... But I can gurantee you this... All the the QQ'ing about what I said doesn't matter... The legendary items, as well as all the items they the mobs and bosses drops, will be come obsolete once WotLK drops on November 13th... No sense QQ'ing over spilled milk... My only point and perspective is that it will be funny to see people running around with items they truly did not earn... And it won't matter for too much longer anyways... The people QQ'ing will treat TBC instances and raids just as they treat the &quot;old world&quot; instances and raids after WotLK drops... In a couple month TBC instances will be used to level up... Then at Lv 68, people will make a beeline to Northrend, ignoring the rest of TBC instances...</div></div><hr />

<br />
To those that think these changes will vastly make encounters easier... Your wrong. However from a healers stand point (In content through Black Temple), these fights will be... slightly easier.<br />
<br />
I did a little math... And it seems (at least from a healers perspective), that things will be a bit easier.<br />
<br />
I'm going to use one fight for an example.<br />
http://wowwebstats.com/cvn5dgwohnwc3?s=84261-120811<br />
<br />
This is from when a couple of my guilds healers helped a guild on the server get Illdari council for the first time. I choose this fight because it is an incredibly healing intensive fight, and doing it the first time is the most extreme conditions a group will face ( it will only get easier and require less healing and less time to down them)<br />
<br />
The fight lasted 14 minutes ( remember this was this groups first time doing this boss encounter)<br />
<br />
<br />
I used 5 mana potions for a total of 14,791 mana (2958.2 per potion).<br />
I received 32,807 mana from VT.<br />
I received 4,600 mana from efficiency (T5 2 peice bonus (+100 mana on overheal with G.Heal).<br />
I received 5,677 mana back from my shadow fiend<br />
I received 2,700 mana back from 9 Procs of my meta gem<br />
For a grand total of 60,575 mana returned through out the fight<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I cast Greater Heal 58 times (23 times I had down ranked to G.Heal 3 (463 mana vs. 712 mana for max rank)<br />
<br />
Now, lets take a look at this fight when 3.0 hits.<br />
<br />
Assuming everything else is the same (before I reduce the duration of the fight)<br />
<br />
I would receive 210% of my mana back from replenishment (assuming I always had it). At 13k Mana this would be 27,300 mana (A loss of 5,500 mana)<br />
For the sake of doing simpler math I still only over heal 46 times, with 46 overheals I would receive 178 extra mana back for each G.heal thanks to serendipity for a total of 8,188 extra mana back.<br />
Only being able to use mana potions once in the fight would cost me another 11,832.8 mana<br />
The down ranking nerf will cost me another 5,727 Mana<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Assuming all things stayed the same I would not gain back another 14871.8 Mana thanks to the changes in 3.0 (or a 25.55% reduction in mana returns)<br />
<br />
So, assuming raid DPS did not go down, A reduction in Bosses health by 30% would slightly make things easier. Easier from a healers perspective at least. On fights where DPS matters even more (RoS, Shade, Teron, Supremus) then the fights will be noticeably easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
lets look at your math real fast and consider if you were a shaman instead:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The fight lasted 14 minutes ( remember this was this groups first time doing this boss encounter)<br />
<br />
<br />
I used 5 mana potions for a total of 14,791 mana (2958.2 per potion).<br />
I received 32,807 mana from VT.<br />
I received 4,600 mana from efficiency (T5 2 peice bonus (+100 mana on overheal with G.Heal).<br />
I received 5,677 mana back from my shadow fiend<br />
I received 2,700 mana back from 9 Procs of my meta gem<br />
For a grand total of 60,575 mana returned through out the fight<br />
<br />
<br />
OK.* 14 minutes is high for most BT clearing guilds....so from that standpoint, its going to get easier.<br />
<br />
Point 1 - you ref this later.* Only one pot in the future...this is equal across all healers<br />
Point 2 - shadow priest equal<br />
Point 3 - Priest Ability only....shamans don't get overheal mana back<br />
Point 4 - shadow fiend and mana tide roughly equal.* i'd say shaman win here a bit but not by much<br />
Point 5 - shaman should wear the same meta gem<br />
<br />
In additon shaman have a mana spring and water shield.* Thats probably roughly equal to the overheal number you had over 14 minutes.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I cast Greater Heal 58 times (23 times I had down ranked to G.Heal 3 (463 mana vs. 712 mana for max rank)<br />
<br />
<br />
important data.* Most of the time, paladins and shamans downrank 95% of their casts here as it's extreme overheal otherwise.* Priests and Druids don't downrank like the other two healing classes do.<br />
<br />
Also, shaman HPM sucks big time versus priests.* For the same mana, priests do 1.4-1.6 times the healing (Healing Wave versus Greater Heal = no comparision....HW often is 1/2 the GH healing strength)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, lets take a look at this fight when 3.0 hits.<br />
I would receive 210% of my mana back from replenishment (assuming I always had it). At 13k Mana this would be 27,300 mana (A loss of 5,500 mana)<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow priests return far less mana.* You might get half that much.* You won't always have it because it's going to be going onto higher mana users than priests who will rake the bottom more (read shamans, paladins, mages)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For the sake of doing simpler math I still only over heal 46 times, with 46 overheals I would receive 178 extra mana back for each G.heal thanks to serendipity for a total of 8,188 extra mana back.<br />
<br />
Paladins and Shamans don't have anything like this.* So we are 8,188 mana shorter (3/4 a bar) beyond your 14,791 mana.* That's almost two full bars for me.<br />
<br />
The big thing you don't mention was your casted and non-casted MP5.* Which I bet is a whole lot higher than the average shaman/paladin....mine is 270ish fully raid buffed in SWP gear up through brut....my guess is yours while casting is what, 500ish due to spirit and Meditation?* Assuming 400mp5 while casting for you (conservative guess), and that you are casting 85% of the seconds in the fight (a typical shaman/paladin rate),* 14 minutes = 840 seconds = 168 mp5 ticks * .85 = 143 ticks.* At a 400 rate, you'd get* 57,200 mana, and I'd get 38,610....another mana bar +<br />
<br />
So you are looking at your paladins and shamans being two mana bars down rather than your one at the end of the 14 minute fight.* With your assumption that a 30% health nerf roughly equals 14k mana....that means the paladins and shamans are OOM still before the end of this fight, or quite near it.<br />
<br />
These two posts should start to shed some light to the doubters.* When you see the priests being 14K mana short over the same amount of time, and the paladins and shamans are telling you we will be worse than the priests...you all should be grateful for the 30% HP nerf so you even have a chance to continue raiding BT/SWP.* Priests have the 2nd best mana regen in 2.4....you here have numbers showing you the priest is going to be OOM without the 30% reduction...<br />
<br />
BTW, great post and good math.*</div></div><hr />

Generally I find that most forums are a cesspool of ignorance and hate so I try to avoid posting...

<br />
Our raids usually have 3 CoH priests and 1-2 Resto shaman, Still their CH is incredibly important so I hope they aren't rendered useless too quickly in our healing intensive fights. I would love to see similar parses from other healing classes using the revised mana costs of spells, and new talents they will likely raid with.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shadow priests return far less mana. You might get half that much. You won't always have it because it's going to be going onto higher mana users than priests who will rake the bottom more (read shamans, paladins, mages)<br />
<br />
My understand is that replenishment will proc for the 10 people in the raid with the lowest amount of mana (% wise? or actual numbers?). Now this is where things get a little muddled for me... My guild has 2 shadow priests and 1 Survival hunter. I was under the impression that replenishment would apply to others if one person already had it... If this isn't the case and replenishment continued to refresh, this could be a very unwelcome change.<br />
<br />
Does anyone out there know exactly how this new mechanic works in the raid?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
My understanding is that it does not do that. It restacks onto the 10 lowest people. Bringing more than one replenishment buff is net zero return or close to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That's no good. Because plain and simple there are certain fights where I want my healers to have an extra supply of mana and then other fights where I want only specific DPSers to have an extra supply.<br />
<br />
I think of thinks like Kaz'rogal where the healers are almost never in trouble of running OOM, while our mages/ele shaman are. If replenishment were to get wasted on healers or a warlock who hadn't life tapped yet... This would be very upsetting.</div></div><hr />

No, I'm not joking.* Go read EJ for the most recent spam numbers versus a target dummy.* It's 3 minutes and some odd seconds....and that matches up exactly with what I see on Brutalius without a shadow priest.<br />

My facts are straight, sir.* You are probably getting the shadow priest which will add about 2 minutes to your CH5 spamming, and chugging pots. In a non mobile fight like Brutalius, both of those easily add 3 minutes of Ch5 spam you no longer have.</div></div><hr />

And you are speaking like SP is an essential, we got one that raids. Do we need more to raid, no, do we manage when he dont raid, yes, will SP be raidwide in 3.0, yes, WIN!<br />

&quot;Yes, and let's not forget the fact that not only are they nerfing the mobs and bosses... They are also nerfing the drops... &quot;<br />

With my Int, such spirit gives you about 440mp5. I can spam what ever I want for a long time. Never run in any mana problem on Ilidan or any other longer boss fights.<br />

Just find balance between mana regen and +heal. That's all I think. If you have only +22 heal red gems and I see that almost on every healer ... then sorry ... you are screwed ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you realize shamans and paladins have no regen from spirit at all, and thus rely exclusively on mp5 gear, which maxes out below 300mp5 while casting in TBC?? We cannot stack anywhere near enough mp5 to make up the difference of 2 mana pots. Your 440 MP5 is almost double my shaman's, and that's with me wearing my full mp5 set rather than the haste heavy one.<br />
<br />
(ok paladins have a crit based mana regen, but that's taking a nerf as well in 3.0.2)<br />
<br />
And Druid healing versus every other healers healing is so radically different in the first place, I don't think you can really compare.* Druids are insane with mana regen in TBC...enjoy it while it lasts....that incoming spirit nerf is going to hurt you guys.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but this is not enough proof for me.<br />
<br />
<br />
~1900 HPS with no jumps. 4k heals/6k crit<br />
OOM in ~ 3 1/2 minutes. Did it 3 times all were in that neighborhood<br />
<br />
3 times test sample, outside raid conditions on a target dummy? Just above your &quot;proof&quot; post, there is a theorycrafting post using WWS data. The total mp5 that was required to last the fight was 318mp5, which is certainly doable with raid-buffs. <br />
<br />
If you expect to continue healing like before the new talents/conditions, you are in for a really bad surprise. The ones who manage to adapt as fast as possible will be succesful. The rest? They might as well try something else. Game is changing, change with it.</div></div><hr />

Basically that sums it up. Your warglaives?: mean zilch. This stuff happens when one expansion is added on to another better one. IF YOU HAVE DOWNED KIL'JAEDEN YOU HAVE FINISHED TBC. Good job! Now go finish your end raids with soon to be meaningless gear and get used to it!<br />

Are you saying the most mana efficient healers are going to be the least affected by this?<br />
<br />
GTFO HERE PLS.<br />
<br />
The reason we are so is because lifebloom is incredibly cheap, and coupled with the 400 or so mp 5 easily obtained, we will be the least affected by this change. This of course is going to change with the double lifebloom nerf and the introduction of an aoe heal over time. We will have our problems too, that much is sure... but shamans and priests are far worse off than we could ever be at the moment.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kelfarr</div><div class="date">2008-10-03, 04:22 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay... For both of the people that have asked why I posted this: Are you going to honestly sit there and expect Blizzard not to nerf the drops either? Come on! Think about this logically... You'd have everyone going after the re-tuned mobs and bosses and and you see dozens of people running around with items they truly didn't earn... The reason the legendary items are so legendary is because you have to have put in so much work and blood, sweat, tears, and frustration to get those items... Only the top guilds and players in the game deserve to have those items... Re-tuned mobs and bosses lose that feel... I think it is only fair to assume Blizzard would nerf the drops along with the mobs and bosses... <br />
<br />
<br />
How stupid are you? Getting a lucky warglaive drop doesn't mean anything. You probably weren't around pre-tbc when getting a legendary actually took blood sweat and tears. <br />
<br />
Who cares if people who can't kill illidan get a chance to? Wotlk will make that gear worthless. Plus there will only be 4 resets left after the patch, so you would have to be really lucky to get 4 warglaives every time.</div></div><hr />

healers deffinitelly wont run oom faster in 3.0.<br />
shear and shield block ... yea right.<br />
this is a nerf to make it easy for people, get used to it. if you mind ...<br />
<br />
<br />
Have you played in beta?<br />
Are you a healer who has downranked?<br />
<br />
My healer has had to use mana pots very rarely due to down ranking (had to take one in BT once). Now, in wrath...I am OOM in less than 3 min.<br />
<br />
Yes, shear and shield block.<br />
Have you tanked him?<br />
Have you tanked all of za? I have. <br />
<br />
so, In my opinion, as a current and beta raider, this is not a nerf. That and players are going to have relearn many abilities, thus even if a tiny nerf, it is understandable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are simply bitter you can't see the rest of the content like most competent players and to make yourself feel better you decide to make fun of others. GG<br />
<br />
That being said I understand that Blizz doesn't want Sunwell to end up being BC's Naxxramas but cmon. 30%? Theres a difference between allowing more guilds to see more content and letting guilds that have no place being in there in the first place. This is the same mistake they made with taking away attunements. Casuals cried.. Blizzard as usual crumbled. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong.. I love the fact I'm going to be able to see Kil'jaeden before the expansion. But what a letdown it is to know that after your guild went cleared everything up to sunwell in 4 months that all you worked towards is made ridiculously easy. No wonder people get tired of this game.. most of them realize that what they accomplished is made trivial whenever a new expansion is released because Blizzard has horrible timing releasing new content.<br />
<br />
<br />

Lol theres not alot of point checking my character out on the armory, last time i logged out i didn't have any of my epics on. (In Brewfest)<br />

Considering all the changes in raid/game mechanics I think it will only be a little easier. Also for all those complaning about this and saying &quot;Buhu everyone is going to kill everything so easy&quot;. I think you have not done fights like M'uru.

Slight correction. If you want me call me one spell spammer ... put Regrowth there instead on lifebloom which is not very to big use to me 'cos of lower +heal.<br />
<br />
Lifebloom spammers have invested all to +heal. That is not my case. I use all the spells but mainly Reg, which is by my opinion most imba druid spell. Lifebloom is the second one.<br />
<br />
Usualy in swstat 70% of my total heal is from Reg. 15% from lifebloom and then there is the rest.<br />
<br />
Ofcourse we will have problems .. same as others. Might be that our will be smaller. This is another reason for +heal stackers (no offence here) to balance +heal with prorer regen. Soooo .... bye bye cheap lifebloom spam .. I don't care.</div></div><hr />

Bosses, trash, whatever were dropping like flies and the chests were a trivial matter. I think we got the fourth chest with over 20 minutes remaining on the timer. By the way, you get 2 ring drops now, so it goes armor&gt;weapon&gt;ring&gt;ring. This was a full pug mind you, none of the 10 people in the raid knew eachother prior and we picked up members through tells in trade chat. On top of that, our second healer dc'd right after hex lord so we did zul'jin with 1 healer, both were resto druids.<br />
<br />
On that note, a pug Gruul I was in repeatedly got face rolled by high king and his cronies in about 30 seconds per attempt, for some odd reason some of the retards in the raid failed to let the mage make the pull. <br />

So, you still have to know the fights and do what your supposed to, but the fights when done correctly are a cake walk.</div></div><hr />
