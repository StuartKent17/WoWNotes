Crithto Leaves Blizzard<br />
We're sorry to see Crithto (http://wow.gamepedia.com/Crithto_%28CM%29) leave and wish him the best in the future! <br />
When my best friend suggested I try to get a job at Blizzard in late 2007, I stopped what I was doing in game, alt-tabbed to my web browser, and checked out the job listings. Sure enough, Game Master positions were open and I thought, what the heck? It wasn’t long before the Community Team accepted me into their ranks, and it’s made all the difference. Fast-forward to today, and I still cannot believe how my life has changed, how I’ve grown as a professional and a person by being a member of the Blizzard family. From my first BlizzCon in 2008, to the orc statue being installed on campus, from the Crithto NPC being added to the game, to seeing the Warcraft film go from being a dream to a reality, my time here has certainly been extremely meaningful. <br />
<br />
What is probably the most difficult decision I’ve ever had to make was to choose to move on to a new opportunity that was recently offered to me. I’ll get to face new challenges and really push my skills as a relationship builder and communicator, but none of this would be possible if it weren’t for my time and experience here at Blizzard. Candidly speaking, the day before I let my managers know I had decided to leave, I cried . . . a lot more than I should probably admit, but I did.<br />
<br />
Blizzard’s games, my teammates, co-workers, and everything about being here and a part of this incredible community for these many years have meant so much to me, I can barely give these genuine emotions enough justice through written words. In a recent email to a close friend, I explained that Blizzard has felt like a “home” to me in the truest sense of the word. And the timing sure made my decision all the more difficult, too, given that my last day will be tomorrow (October 8) and I won’t be able to see some of you at BlizzCon as a Blizzard employee (though I do hope to attend).<br />
<br />
I can’t thank all of you enough for your love and support, the weird pug pictures you’ve sent me on Twitter, and for your genuine passion for this game and all things Blizzard. I may be stepping down as “Crithto”, but I will always remain a fellow gamer, and I’m sure we’ll cross paths at some point again in the near future. /Respect, /Hug, /Farewell!<br />

Any game from here on will have in-game purchases, boosts etc. It's all about the money and Blizzard isn't going to stay behind. In fact, we have seen a little bit of that already in WoW. Blizzard once had all their eggs in 1 basket when they were on the brink of bankruptcy. WoW saved their asses and now they've put their eggs in multiple baskets.. WoW isn't so important for them anymore and while they seem to make an effort... it's pretty much in vain. The wacraft category needs something entirely new. But mostly for us, not for them.</div></div><hr />

Crithto mentioned e-sports and that his job (or maybe physically; little difference either way) is just an hour away from Blizzard. Square-Enix doesn't fit.</div></div><hr />

It feels more like a ship that's getting close to its final destination and retirement. 11+ years is a very long timespan for an MMO and I'm fairly certain it's gonna stay up, even though with a low player count, for at least once that much, similiar to Ultima Online and other MMOs of past.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I'm sure the top dogs behind Activision-Blizzard are more concerned about WoW still being in the lead, number wise, than they are of the game losing half the subscribers base &amp; the profit that comes with those.<br />
<br />

yep Im sure being #1 is so very terrible :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
and that they are horrified that an 11. y.o. game is not doing as good as it used to in its peak :rolleyes: I mean that sounds so unbelievable, whatever shall they do, they surely did not know it would happen one day and did not take steps to diversify from WoW :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

Still one of (if not THE) the biggest, simple as that. Subs come and go with each expansion. If you honestly think there is even a chance WoW is dying then you need to wake up.</div></div><hr />

How can a game be sinking ship? Every game (and even everythig in life) got some life length. Some games live short, some long. Some gets easily forgotten while others are played long beyond time they were meant and made to be played. Wow is a massive success and I can't think of any other game that had been active through 10 years, had over 10 mln of players (of which many played a couple of years or so, some even 10) and is still popular. What is happening to Wow is that it finally aged and without replacing everything in it totally (so basically making a new game) it is impossible to make it feel new. It is just a natural way of things and no amount of changes can reverse it. Yet some people can't understand that and either expect Blizz to make a miracle (like naive children...) or simply think they are smart because they are pointing the fact that something is old and can't help itself any more. It is like laughing of grandpa that he is old and can't run fast any more. Nothing lasts forver, Wow will be down some day (though it may still be up for some years in ftp;)) so if all your life is about this game then you should rethink your life, find new perspective to avoid big, devastating dissapointment and depression when Wow servers go down.</div></div><hr />

Can you honestly tell me you think that if Legion was released tomorrow with as much (varied) content at launch as TBC/WotLK had + the guarentee of multiple, regular updates like we used to get, that the subs would still be plummeting just because &quot;it's old&quot;?

<br />
<br />
and if a &quot;dying&quot; WoW can do that then what does it say about all of its competitors ? :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
There's a huge flaw in your argument. They also have the largest team of all the MMO's.<br />
You can't afford to keep losing money *and* continually devote the same amount of resources.<br />
<br />
Financially it becomes *stupid* to keep people on the WoW team and not to migrate them to another project.<br />
<br />
WoW isn't going anywhere in the next 2 years, certainly, but in 5-10? I'm not so confident we will see World of Warcraft in 2025. I'm not so confident we'll even see Blizzard release another MMO by the time WoW &quot;dies&quot;.<br />
<br />
And, to add, are you still going to defend WoW when it doesn't have most subscribes in a US market (because you'll cry if you see the China market right now)? What will you do then? Or perhaps you'll already have quit because all your friends quit long before that point. That's another issue people often forget. It's kind of hard to raid when you can only put 4 people together. That's not even enough for a dungeon.<br />
<br />
Eventually another realm merging will be needed to maintain a sense of people in the world otherwise servers will feel empty and people won't pay to realm/faction change over and over.<br />
<br />
This is the reality. Surely WoW may never due in the sense private servers are open however in the sense Blizzard's servers are open? I find that difficult to believe. There *will* absolutely be a day WoW will die and, as often said before, it will likely be due to their own lead's failing so hard people go somewhere else.<br />
<br />
I, myself, have begun playing other games. I even went so far as to get a PS4 -- first one in over 10 years. Legion has me curious but not very hopefuly. Their integrity is on the line and this is their last chance to redeem themselves for me. After that... I'll just play CS:GO, LoL, SC2 (woo! new xpac soon! WOO WOOOOOOO!) and whatever else tickles my fancy.<br />

Since cata? This has been going on since TBC whenever a new game comes out. Or is announced. We all forget that even if WoW is losing subs, the game is still doing great and will continue to do so for years to come. And Blizzard is doing better than ever. This was a community manager and the WoW community is doing nothing but getting worse. It is by far the worst aspect of the game.<br />
<br />
Players scream and cry that Blizzard isn't doing anything to help their game because they're greedy corporate types that don't want more money. Meanwhile the players have &quot;all the answers&quot; but can't even fix themselves.</div></div><hr />

This is the most sensible post I've seen yet. Finally someone said what I've thought for a good while...age has little to no significance to these falling numbers. The players have been slowly walled off from each other and made to become less dependent on one another like the earlier expansions. There is very little community now. Also, way too much Orc for waaaay to long. In my opinion, the &quot;Garrosh Story&quot; latest way to long.</div></div><hr />

Read a few of his posts and some of em have come off as saying it how it is. Obviously not representable of them all. Careful with rolling on the floor btw I came across a spider when I did that and well :(. As for Metzen he ain't going anywhere anytime soon.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Not A Cat</div><div class="date">2015-10-09, 05:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And here we see the same arguments we've seen for the last 7-8 years or so. People just really want this game to die. Albeit I would love it if some new MMO came out that can actually rival WoW, but so far everything has been a flop. Yeah I still play GW2 and FFXIV, but ever so rarely. To be fair though I kind of do the same thing with WoW, but I definitely play it more often.<br />
<br />
I could be totally off, but I feel like WoW's decline has been steady, but we saw a spike in subs when WoD came out because it was hyped to shit. Then most of the people who bought into the hype left. Which then kind of backfired because all of those people left and then some. Ever since its peak in WoTLK, the game has been declining in subs. But why? There's definitely more things to do than there were in WotLK when it comes to endgame. The only reason I think people look at WoTLK so fondly is because it was probably when a majority of the playerbase actually raided anything besides Karazhan. Because Christ I remember countless threads of people complaining that they already have all of the raids on farm, and that there's nothing to do, this game sucks, etc. That was merely a vocal minority compared to the amount of people who were raiding with their guilds and progressing for possibly the first time and having fun.<br />
<br />
Now jump ahead to WoD, raiding is commonplace, that vocal minority in WotLK is now the majority and it's all just so tedious and monotonous now. But it's ALWAYS been tedious and monotonous. WotLK is when I started unsubbing until the next content patch. I probably would have started in BC, but that's when I started raiding and that's when it was new and fun for me to do it all of the time. Don't get me wrong I'm not saying I hate the game, my complaints are more aimed at the genre itself. MMOs in general are just tedious and monotonous. A new shiny thing comes out and it's fun for a little bit, then it becomes tedious and monotonous. I remember when Warhammer: Age of Reckoning and Aion were on their way out. I was all over the, &quot;WoW is dying&quot; bandwagon. I played both of them, liked them, but got bored and quit and came back to WoW when ICC came out. I was all hyped for Cataclysm, where for some reason I thought raiding was going to be new and fun again because it would be difficult. It was difficult, but it wasn't new and fun. Actually the difficulty made it more tedious and monotonous. Rinse and repeat until Dragon Soul, which to this day is the only raid that I really think was objectively bad. 4.3 was just awful and I will always hate everything about, and I think it was definitely when the game was at its worst. But I digress, my point is that WoW and all MMOs for that matter have been doing the same shit for the past decade and it's pretty lame.<br />
<br />
I think Blizzard is even noticing this. I doubt they're ever going to release another MMO, and they will probably keep milking WoW until enough people stop playing. With that being said, they're hardly a sinking ship. They are still making money off of WoW. God knows how much they make from Hearthstone. They also still have SC and Diablo, and now Overwatch on the way. Even if WoW is dying (as it is older than dirt in MMO years) I don't foresee anything happening to Blizzard for a long while. Needless to say this is all just my opinion and speculation, I don't know what Blizzard thinks and honestly I can't say I care too much. I vote with my wallet, if I like it, I'll pay for it. If I don't like it, I won't pay for it.<br />
<br />
Oh my god this is disgustingly long<br />
<br />
TL;DR MMOs are boring</div></div><hr />

You're also ignoring all the people Blizzard has hired since then. But of course since that doesn't stir up the pot, you don't care. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

with all due respect to the ppl they hired, but i dont give a damn about them, i hate to see the ppl that made those games that i and a lot of us love go elsewhere or go to random projects inside blizzard while those franchises they helped to build start to rot or shift into something so different from what we used to love that i dont recognize them anymore.</div></div><hr />
