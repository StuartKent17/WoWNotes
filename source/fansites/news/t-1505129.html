Warlords of Draenor Alpha - Build 18179 Sword<br />
There was one weapon model which didn't make it into the notes (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3933-Warlords-of-Draenor-Alpha-Build-18179-Blue-Tweets-Wowcraft-3-Warcraft-Movie) yesterday.

Flying in Warlords of Draenor<br />
This probably should have been kept to the original thread, but caution to thee, wind, I say! (I say that.)<br />
<br />
So everyone has seen various posts and comments around the World Wide Web about flying not being allowed in Draenor, why, and what that means. It’d probably be helpful to try to sum up some of those things, and potentially help build a foundation for anyone’s discussions on the topic going forward. If everyone has the same info then it just helps conversations glide along, as you can expect everyone else knows what you know! Knowledge Parity! (Knarity?)<br />
<br />
Anyway, it’s important to first dissuade concerns that we’re looking to slow down the game (I’ve recently posted about this in another thread, but it bears repeating). We’re going to be making sure flight paths and other forms of travel are quick and efficient, with a goal of getting you to the places you want to go. The flight paths in Draenor are not going to be loop-de-loop sightseeing tours, and we’re going to be looking to our beta testers to let us know if any are less than tip-top.<br />
<br />
Our goal is not to make travel time consuming or painful, and with players on ground mounts we know we'll have to do more to try to ensure people can get to where they want to go quickly… BUT being able to lift off and fly over content compromises many of our goals in how the game world is approached, how it's played, how it's consumed, and how the content is designed to account for those factors.<br />
<br />
As an example, let us consider a quest to assassinate an enemy leader. From the ground you approach a fort with guards at the gate. You charge and are able to dispatch them and sneak in a side hallway. You methodically take out packs of roaming sentries, and some of them shout at you as they run toward you. You notice they’re in the middle of practicing dark and forbidden magics, and you take a moment to disrupt their ritual. Dashing into the main courtyard you spot your target, sneaking and fighting your way to him--and with a forceful slash--the fort’s captain is vanquished, and as guards are alerted you fight your way out, glorious and triumphant in your success.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, from a flying mount, you fly over the gate, see some guy whose name is highlighted, land on top of him, kill him, and then fly away.<br />
<br />
Being efficient is great, being clever is great, and using your cleverness to be efficient is great, but how many of us have done the Tillers dailies up on the cliffside where the Hozen are, and waited for packs to pass by before setting down right where you’re supposed to, use whatever thingamabob you’re supposed to, and then lift off ASAP hoping-hoping-hoping nothing aggros? How many of us have become furious when we actually have to fight something!? Is that clever gameplay? Is that being good at playing the game, or is it using a mechanic to avoid having to play it? Is that what the game should be, and what our expectations should be as gamers playing it?<br />
<br />
I hope everyone can agree, regardless of personal opinion toward flight vs. non-flight, that flying fundamentally alters how content is approached in a world where the gameplay exists wholly on the ground.<br />
<br />
In Draenor we’re designing max-level content, portions of zones or zones in their entirety that will be dedicated to max-level gameplay—and not just the top of a cliffside, or some dailies in the Vale. There’s a harsh change in how the game plays between leveling, and when you hit max level. Hitting 100 and instantly switching everything you do to raiding or Arenas is pretty abrupt, and we want to try to keep that questing experience available at max level with something more robust than daily quests. We don’t think having all of that content inside buildings, or constantly challenged by sky cannons, or with magical no-flying smoke, or within some kind of dismount bubble is the most straightforward or best solution to the ultimate issue in that World of Warcraft is not a flight sim, and that's just not what the content of the game is about. Even at level 100 there will be no small portions of the game world intended to provide relevant content even to max-level players. These zones may even unlock over the course of the expansion, or the content in them will progress in story and scope throughout content patches. Content has to be designed with the expectation that there either is or is not flight, and approaching ground-level content from the ground offers more compelling gameplay. Raids, dungeons, and PvP continue to disallow flying for this same reason.<br />
<br />
It's also important to think about not just what the content is, but how it's experienced. Not everyone that plays the game cares how quests and outdoor content are experienced, of course. Some may find it unnecessary; they don't feel it adds anything to their experience. Others play through it fairly quickly, enjoy it, but don’t particularly want to put much thought into why. Some may begrudgingly trudge through the content just so they can get to the part of the game they do want to play, and any other number of situations and preferences.<br />
<br />
I’m sure some of you see the fortress example with the flying mount and see nothing wrong, if that’s how someone wants to play the game they should be allowed to. But a game is largely defined by its limitations, and the rules within which you must find or create a solution. We’re not trying to create a slow and laborious game (hopefully people actually enjoy the content!), or expect people will be yelling “YIIIPPPEEEEE!” while fighting a mob that aggroed when they tried to pick an herb, but there’s a big difference between a slow and laborious game and the expectation of instant gratification—not to mention the somewhat nebulous intention of creating and maintaining an engaging and immersive game world. World of Warcraft is a persistent online roleplaying game, and as much as we let players choose how they improve their characters within the world; leveling through dungeons, or PvP, or questing; choosing to do Arenas, or raids, or both; we’re still always wanting to create a holistic experience that supports all of these things. That doesn’t mean we think it’s a good idea to force people to read all their quest text, or stare at and appreciate the pretty new models, or anything like that, but it’s not unreasonable to see that combat and content exist on the ground, understand that, embrace that, and make decisions to support it.<br />
<br />
In summary: It’s important to us that we integrate max-level questing into the expansion more thoroughly than designated daily locations on mountain tops, or only have the option of releasing new max level content in magically appearing islands where flight has different rules because reasons. We also know that being able to approach content that’s on the ground from up in the air compromises much of what creates the game world, how it's played, and how it's consumed. The game experience is fundamentally altered when you can lift off and set down wherever you want. And lastly, that we’re not intending to slow anyone down, and we’re going to make sure that players can get where they want to go efficiently through more direct flight points, and potentially alternate travel methods.<br />
<br />
None of this is new philosophy; it's something we've maintained since Burning Crusade when flight was introduced, but it has evolved over the years, and I expect it to continue to be—like everything we do—an iterative process. And hopefully this has been at least marginally informative.<br />
<br />
yet, we have yet to receive an answer as to when flying will be implemented, if at all. sounds to me like not at all.<br />
We don't know. We don't purport to have definitive answers for anything, especially before we've even begun external testing.<br />
<br />
Everything in this game is about time consumption. Hands down. I see no problem with that because after all the business model dictates it (meaning the goal is to acquire another monthly payment from the customer).<br />
<br />
I guess what im saying is that there are adults in the room and we know that no flying at drop of xpacs is purely a business decision (again, one thaty I do not have a problem with).<br />
<br />
Try shooting us straight from time to time...were not all kids.<br />
Making a fun game makes people want to play the game, not nickle and diming their time. Was the game an insulting disservice to you as an adult before flying existed?<br />
<br />
The dishonest are want to identify dishonesty, even where it doesn't exist.</div></div><hr />

I'm fully aware that a raid tier or even dungeons is a significantly bigger time investment than mounts but if this ends up on the Blizzard store, to which it probably will then it's outright insulting.

But the Blue example, of the Tiller's daily, was terrible, because the inference there was fighting through the same tedious mobs every bloody day which is something no-one in their right mind wants to do.<br />
<br />
No flying to increase the challenge of leveling and making the gameworld they spend years designing and developing is one thing, but having to grind through the same mobs to do dailies is not something we even want to think about as being a possibility. But that Blue post has made it so.</div></div><hr />

Such a solution would obviously require a lot of thought and care in its implementation, but I think it's the best of both worlds.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mellrod</div><div class="date">2014-04-25, 11:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Idk why anybody says it's a store mount when the text insinuates it will be for RAF. But then again, people assume everything will be put in stores whenever a mount is previewed. All i know is that it's mount icon was datamined in wowhead a long time ago as &quot;[PH] the Equinator (http://wod.wowhead.com/spell=156726#comments)&quot;<br />
<br />
Also, I still think Blizzard is right in no flying. I've played ebnough woW to trust their design choices, and they made a SHIT TON of content that involves exploration and timeless isle-type stuff. It'd all be undermined if we just flew over it so one patch without flying isnt a big deal, they just want us to actually play this content they worked so hard on. They already said flying mounts will double as ground mounts. It's not like flight is going away forever. We also get to do a questline instead of paying for it, so that'll be interesting as long as it's as engaging as the Rogue Legendary of Cata and not Wrathion's Grind-A-Thon<br />
<br />
P.S. Those swords look nice. Not spectacular, but not exactly bland imo. Although looks are subjective, and not everything needs to look super awesome. I'm sure there's a neat concept behind the design choice for each WoD weapon.</div></div><hr />

Wow. F you too Blizzard. To answer this insulting idiot's question, no the game wasn't an insulting disservice to me as an adult before flying existed. But then, flying was added to the game.

<br />
I'm fully aware that a raid tier or even dungeons is a significantly bigger time investment than mounts but if this ends up on the Blizzard store, to which it probably will then it's outright insulting. Every single bit of focus mounts or otherwise should be directed at WoD so we don't have to wait another 6 months with SoO.As far as I know the time that goes into making models like this one averages 20 minutes. Also I think it's likely that a different team handles different it from the Team who works on content, and if not, meh... I don't really care. Even if the model took an hour to make, which is very unlikely given how many Blizzard are churning out it's not a huge time investment and I can wait one more hour for an expansion pack.<br />
<br />
Also, it's blatantly a new RAF mount. I'm not gonna get it because I already have a far better one IMO and I don't typically spend money on mounts, I bought the... wingy sphinx guardian thing or whatever it was a while back and that has been it.</div></div><hr />

Its like playing a game where you have sanctuary wherever you go... especially when it comes to pvp, oh you got ganked? well mount up and you are safe from LITERALLY EVERYTHING.<br />
<br />
But finally its not the case! I miss the days when we actually had crazy chases in the barrens when allys came knocking around for fun... today you just dont bother because its no use, you cant do anything about it anyway thanks to flying mounts aka flying mobile shattrath/dalaran sanctuary.<br />
Chasing someone from durotar to barrens and stonetalon mountains was fun... all in the name of world pvp. And this happened on a non-PvP server!<br />
<br />
it brought the server together, we became &quot;friends&quot; on the battlefield and remember eachothers duels and whatever battles occurred. And that in turn was seen on the forums by knowing the other guy and how fun it was.<br />
Now even the opposing faction has given up even trying world pvp because its no fun with flying mounts, the only times you might see allys in orgrimmar and vice versa is during some festival when you need to visit enemy capitals.</div></div><hr />

Such a solution would obviously require a lot of thought and care in its implementation, but I think it's the best of both worlds.<br />
<br />
Except people don't really care about the free flying thing, they want the convenience of the swoop-straight-to-the-point, heck I enjoy that as well. But thinking back to all the memories of this game where I actually enjoyed the game world, they were all on ground. If you feel like you have so little time to play the game that you actually just want to skip everything, maybe you should do something else than playing an mmo? The constant bitching about every change here and there makes me question this even more. Why do you play? Is wow simply a machine designed to bring you instant gratification?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Now if only they'd add in collision detection in PvP, then I'd be truly happy :DHow dare you suggest hitboxes, do you have any idea the amount of time and money it would take?? Time Activision and Blizzard could be better spending making mounts and pets for entitled ingrates who don't like fun. Obviously!<br />
<br />
I agree, that'd be neat, making WoW an action RPG in it's truest sense. I could see a few technical issues though.<br />
<br />
Gnomes and goblins would be hard to hit.<br />
<br />
Roll would be way overpowered.<br />
<br />
Charge would be way underpowered.<br />
<br />
No one would ever roll Tauren.<br />
<br />
But yeah, making wow an action RPG with collision detection and hitboxes would basically mean changing every skill in the game, I would suggest Warframe, Vindictus or Spiral Knights if you're looking for a decent action RPG to play with friends.</div></div><hr />

While I am tired of the constant mounts, and I can safely say getting a mount never was the reason I invited people to play wow. This is likely Scroll of Res, not RaF. Because the market for warcraft is all people that have already played warcraft. It isn't new players</div></div><hr />

<br />
people take flight for granted. well, you're gonna miss it when it's gone and you have to walk to gather mats, quit archaeology for the same reason, afk on flight paths because they're slow and boring compared to flying yourself, and most importantly, lose the ability to go where you want to go.<br />
<br />
edit: another thing, blizzard's reasoning for removing it sucks ass. everyone and their mother knows the main reason is to slow down the rate of content consumption. instead of killing flight, blizzard should be coming up with content that utilizes it. if you don't want us to land down, kill an NPC, and fly off. how about not making that quest, hm? kill quests are boring anyway. <br />
<br />
how about blizz sit down and come up with more interesting quests like the flying mount race in jade forest, or that rolling quest on serpent's spine? they won't because blizzard doesn't have a shred of creativity left in that company.</div></div><hr />

Hmm... perhaps there maybe a compromise of some sort, we'll have to see. I was thinking maybe flight paths use your current flight mount instead of the low-poly gryphon or chimaera models.<br />

Another upside, we won't have a huge money sink or two! I've bought epic flying on three characters and 310% flying on one and it's a hell of a cost for a more &quot;casual&quot; player like myself who doesn't have time to get 10s of thousands of gold together.<br />

Taking away choice (at max level), annoying a significant part of the player base and making gameplay feel forced, linear and clunky is something I expect from a console game but not a pc mmo.<br />
This whole removing of choice will make the game feel bland, its not only flying, its the removal of usefull abilities, reforging, gemming (to a certain extend) and pvp-related healing changes without getting anything in return.<br />

<br />
You may be right, and to be honest I think it will fall somewhere in the middle. They know they had a backlash with the Golden Lotus dailies and how repetitive they were. I think Golden Lotus dailies are a *prime* example of what happens to content when you can fly in and out. You end up with clustered and combined quests (killing x mobs, finding y mats, killing z elite, freeing b captives in the same area) to attempt to keep you on the ground. This is the only way they can keep you from flight hopping and it *still* doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I'd rather all those 4-5 quests be just 2 in the area that will rotate each day but provide the same reward. I will have to fight my way through *or* sneak past *or* CC to get to the captives on day one. Then, on day two, same but instead of captives maybe kill an elite. Finally day three may just be to kill mobs and I'll avoid the Elite and not bother with the captives. All 3 scenarios put you in the same place and involve similar things but don't require you to do all 3 quests, every day, every week and be so burnt out and annoyed that you never ever set foot there again after the next patch. <br />
<br />
I guess my point is that Blizz needs timesinks but Golden Lotus dailies are the example of how horrible it is when you have the same timesinks all the time. It would be wise for them to keep the overall reward the same, but allow people to use their own abilities and skills and find their own ways to &quot;skip&quot; content instead of flying in and out to &quot;skip&quot; it. One makes you feel rewarded for being clever, the other makes you feel annoyed for being forced to actually fight a mob. What we have now is convoluted ways to force us to experience content. That isn't fun and I think you'd be hard-pressed to find anyone who thinks it is.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hardkorr</div><div class="date">2014-04-26, 12:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I gotta say, the fortress example this guy provided shows that he know about story through gameplay. However, the author then went and said this:<br />
<br />
&quot;It's also important to think about not just what the content is, but how it's experienced. Not everyone that plays the game cares how quests and outdoor content are experienced, of course. Some may find it unnecessary; they don't feel it adds anything to their experience. Others play through it fairly quickly, enjoy it, but don’t particularly want to put much thought into why. Some may begrudgingly trudge through the content just so they can get to the part of the game they do want to play, and any other number of situations and preferences.<br />
<br />
I’m sure some of you see the fortress example with the flying mount and see nothing wrong, if that’s how someone wants to play the game they should be allowed to.&quot;<br />
<br />
It's this shit that grinds my gears. Notice how all the examples are considering players who don't actually want to play the game for the story. When a persistent game like WoW is able to make content that caters to players who don't care about the lore or questing experience, it opens up a positive feedback loop for that type of gameplay. Example: WoW allows players to burn through a zone's story to get to &quot;other things&quot;, players focus on &quot;other things&quot;, players who are more story oriented leave and players who love &quot;other things&quot; join the game, WoW notices trend and next round of content allows players to burn through story to get to &quot;other things&quot;, etc.<br />
<br />
The content in a videogame determines who plays it, and who doesn't. WoW is no exception. Yeah the game has a high turnover rate and is bleeding subs, but the playerbase has also fundamentally changed overtime because of stuff like this (How many people you met since you started are still playing now?).</div></div><hr />

Possibly even the first few/dozen times. It becomes tedious, however, fighting your way past random packs of mobs on a daily basis to accomplish a simple task...and regardless of their dismissal, it IS simply a way of stretching the game and eating up time with simple, no-brainer, low-cost content.<br />
<br />
Timeless Isle--for example--was neat for a short while, but after the twentieth time fighting past all of those cows to get to the top of that long, winding path to Ordos--and getting knocked off the trail from time to time for some reason or another, forcing me to start the climb over from the beginning--I really, really got fed up with the timesink involved in completing that particular objective. The same became so for most of the rest of the quests in that area. At first it was great, but spending my time battling 50 trash mobs just to get to the area where I really need to be every single day really began to wore thin on me until eventually I just stopped completely without having reached several goals I had set myself. I just didn't care to spend the time doing it anymore. I can't see myself getting excited for that sort of content over a prolonged period. Again, the first few times? Sure. Repeatedly over a span of a month or more? Most likely not.<br />
<br />
Is it really such a crime or &quot;sense of entitlement&quot; to not want to waste your time on content that has grown stale? It becomes less of an obstacle on the path to your goal and more of a chore to be done before the &quot;fun&quot; can start. Their analogy of assassinating an enemy leader by sneaking into a stronghold, etc. is great...if it's your first time doing it. If it's something you need to do regularly for whatever reason (reputation gain, quest drops, dailies)? Where exactly is the fun to be had in that? Beginners should absolutely experience all of it. People who have been doing it daily for weeks or months on end? I'm not sure their play experience is being enriched by that point. Merely lengthened.<br />
<br />
The crux of it for me is this: I've stayed subbed to WoW for most of its lifespan, having not cancelled once since I started my subscription back in its first or second year. What's kept me subbed during the long stretches between patches and expansions has been the ability to log on, accomplish something meaningful, and log out without having spent the bulk of my day behind a computer screen. If, after experiencing the content available for a reasonable amount of time, my playtime once again becomes plagued by long periods of travel as it was back in &quot;Vanilla&quot; (not just due to infrequent flight paths, but also because of the mob ambushes along the way), I'm not sure I could justify staying subbed during the lulls between content infusions. <br />
<br />
Oh I won't be quitting WoW. I still love the game to this day. I just wouldn't be subbing continuously anymore. That may not amount to a lot of money lost for Blizzard, but I'm not really concerned about their bottom line. The time I might end up wasting on a daily basis on a part of the game I no longer enjoyed (and couldn't bypass) would definitely sour several aspects for me. I can't even imagine myself completing all of the Archaeology objectives in the new expansion, for example, should flight never be enabled. Not to mention not being able to &quot;sit&quot; in place in the air and view the breathtaking vistas laid out beneath you. A bit sad, really.<br />
<br />
As always I reserve final judgment until I've actually played and experienced it for myself. My initial feeling, however, is that a decision to cut out flight entirely from the new expansion would not be the best call in the world. This has nothing to do with &quot;entitlement&quot; or &quot;casuals&quot; or &quot;easy mode&quot;. It's rather disheartening--but not, of course, surprising--to see it being dismissed as such.</div></div><hr />

It's not the players' fault that MoP had no overall plot, story or villain, and the 'being forced to use mystery islands' excuse is just evidence that Blizzard put absolutely no planning into MoP beyond the first raid tier.</div></div><hr />

Im not looking for instant gratification, I just dont see the added value of restricting flying past level 100 or taking away choices from people that don't affect anyone else<br />
<br />
Because they *could* just have you fly to the middle of the island, click on a chest, and get a full set of epics. What they have realized is that by allowing flight, it has backed them into a corner where they have to make bad design decisions in order to try and prevent you from just flying in, winning, and flying out. Would it be elitist for people to want actual content instead of one chest of full epics? There is a grey area and people feel, and Blizz is seeming to agree, that flight falls out of the grey area and into the &quot;bad&quot; area. Making us kill every mob on the way to one elite that will take 20 min to get to for a weak reward would also fall into the &quot;bad&quot; area. There is a middle ground. <br />
<br />
The truth is Blizz made a mistake by ever allowing you to play the way you have grown accustomed. That is why it has taken them so long to try and fix it. It cannot be fixed if they want to bring back that feeling we had in Vanilla or even Isle of Quel'Danas (which was a flight-restricted zone after flying was implemented even at max level). Timeless Isle was an attempt to ease us into no flying. They have made this decision because they feel it will make for a more enjoyable experience for you to play the way they want instead of the way you do now. If every quest is fly in, win, fly out, they all feel the same. They basically are all the same. Do you really think doing the same thing 100 times is more fun than taking the same time to do 10 things that vary and net you the same reward?<br />
<br />
Also imo, mats won't be ruined by this. They can simply a) make nodes give more mats or b) make crafting cost less mats. In many cases, this will make gathering professions actually worth more. Mats were too abundant imo and it became the better choice to buy them because they were so cheap. This made having two crafting professions instead of a crafting + gathering profession the better decision. *That* takes away choice.<br />
<br />
Finally, the level 90 boost is definitely an &quot;instant gratification situation&quot; (trademarked) but it is also for outdated content. Leveling to 90 is something that hasn't been current for most people (outside of alts) for over a year. By offering the boost with the xpac, it allows people to make an alt that they may not have done if they had to spend the time to level it to 90. This may help add tanks or healers to the game which is a plus. It also gives people something to gear up and practice with in the gap between xpacs. I personally love my MW Monk and I doubt I would have spent the time to level it to 90 after I already had 5+ 90s. There is no doubt the boost allows you to skip content. But it is old content and is *not* the same as not allowing flight in WoD.</div></div><hr />

No, it will feel more annoying. Similar to having all these dailys felt immensely annoying at the beginning of Pandaria. I don't have to kill these other people, they're not part of my quest and they only slow me down. They're not a threat, not a goal, not worth killing, all they are is something that slows me down and annoys me.<br />
People will wait and hope someone else aggro's them, they will try to find ways around them and so on. Ultimatively many wont bother anymore with these quests or going out there in generall, because it's not fun but something you want to be over with.

That's because the content/continent was planned out to completion from the start, and we always had ICC in the back of our minds throughout the entire expansion, because, like blackrock mountain in vanilla, you could see the spires of ICC from far away, and knew everything was building towards it. It's not the players' fault that MoP had no overall plot, story or villain, and the 'being forced to use mystery islands' excuse is just evidence that Blizzard put absolutely no planning into MoP beyond the first raid tier.<br />
<br />
But as far as I can recall, WotLK had no real outdoor content once you reached max level. ICC was a raid and does not involve flight in anyway. They added outdoor content in MoP specifically to *add* choice for people who don't just like to raid. They realized that this cannot be done well with flight. One may prefer flight and no outdoor content after you level. I personally feel, and Blizz seems to agree, that I'd rather have well-designed outdoor content with no flight *if* they add great flightpaths and portals. As long as I can get to the section of the world I want to pretty much instantly, but forced to experience that content once there, I personally think this will be a much better game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize your comment is basically an oxymoron, right?<br />
<br />
According to the no flying crowd, flying is a way to avoid mobs (something we've been doing since vanilla), a way to avoid wpvp (if you are on a PVE server, there's a big chance you didn't care about wpvp to begin with), a way to skip over content (I don't buy this excuse). <br />
<br />
I used to feign death and use my pet as reaver fodder back in BC all of the time. Rogue's could vanish and run off. Isn't that the same exact thing as &quot;avoiding mobs&quot;? I couldn't tell you how many people STILL- after 10 years- fall for the old feign death trick.</div></div><hr />

It may take longer to get from point A to point B, but at least you feel part of the world. I wouldn't stop using my flying mount in WoW because it's more efficient when trying to do dailies or grind mats, but I wouldn't be opposed to their elimination altogether. Or at least in current expansion content.<br />
<br />
truth, flying through mount hyjal while questing immediately activated auto pilot straight to 85 (literally and figuratively). any potential immersion was lost due to the fact i could skip so much content. though i would be opposed to eliminating flying yet more than fine with it being disable from wod zones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I started in the very beginning of BC as well and I personally don't care. Flying to me is pointless and only convenient for gathering professions. Other than that there are enough flight paths and portals to get where you need to go and I'm sure there will be enough of those come WoD. :)<br />
<br />
I mean, in Cata, you could skip everything. Kill a mob, no need to fight your way out. Just mount up and fly away. A quest that took time to complete ended up taking 30 seconds with flying. No thanks. No wonder everyone ended up max level in less than one week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why are people ok with that?<br />
<br />
before setting down right where you’re supposed to, use whatever thingamabob you’re supposed to, and then lift off ASAP hoping-hoping-hoping nothing aggros? How many of us have become furious when we actually have to fight something!? Is that clever gameplay? Is that being good at playing the game, or is it using a mechanic to avoid having to play it? Is that what the game should be, and what our expectations should be as gamers playing it?<br />
<br />
This isn't the players fault, it is their fault as a company for making basic combat not interesting or rewarding enough for the time required to do it. If people want to avoid something, it isn't because its a good fun thing, its because it is a annoying useless mechanic.<br />
<br />
Making a fun game makes people want to play the game, not nickle and diming their time. Was the game an insulting disservice to you as an adult before flying existed?<br />
<br />
The dishonest are want to identify dishonesty, even where it doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
No it wasn't &quot;insulting etc&quot; because it didn't exist before. Now they are taking something away that we already have. <br />
<br />
The only think that is insulting is the fact that Blizz constantly spits in their consumers faces. They continually release less and less and ask for more and more in return. They have shitty business ethics and puerile attitudes.</div></div><hr />

Because it is a game, and the developers are hired to make decisions that make the game feel fun and rewarding. If it were up to players, the quest mob would be 1 second away from the quest giver.

We don't want to be fodder for someone looking for PvP or have to compete with bots for either drops of nodes. All this does is amplify the issues that have been introduced via CRZ and merged servers. Taking out flying will be fine until 1 week in when you have a bunch of bored 100s who have nothing to do but go camp the nearest chokepoint in the questing/leveling experience. <br />
<br />
This is a stupid idea.<br />
<br />
It is all based on the notion that we each have a slew of friends who are at our beck and call for dungeons to questing to whatever. Dungeon finder and the like came into being for a reason. It is a shame WoD needs to remind Blizzard how/why they came to where they are.<br />

But it is factual, they want to elongate the time people play the game. They want to make people play longer, because the longer people play, the more money they make. Also the longer people play, the more invested the person gets in the game and then the player is less likely to quit. <br />

It's getting shit done fast so you can get to what you want to get to. Theres a difference between Elitism and calling out idiocy, besides they have given you a reason, a large wall of texty reason as to why, you're only asking further despite the length of clarification because you demand a change, and so far there's been no signs Blizzard are going back on this, so get over it. You are entitled to stop giving them a subscription fee if it means that much to you.<br />
<br />

<br />
For me personally, it'll mean people can't leg it and fly away when they come at me in PVP and realize they are going to lose in the miraculous off chance I manage to stand my ground. Also WoW is a game that has it's focus primarily on the ground. Flying jeopardizes the questing experience and immersion for a lot of people, also it means World PVP might happen somewhat and it also means that Azeroth should feel a bit more alive since everyone will be on the ground rather than flying in empty cloud space. You're going to pass by people which makes the game world feel more populated.<br />
<br />
These aren't in any of the reasons the GM stated, but they're just as valid.<br />
<br />
It's not a hard reasoning to grasp. When given the choice, people will fly, when there's no choice, then it makes it easy to adjust to non-flying.</div></div><hr />

What they have realized is that by allowing flight, it has backed them into a corner where they have to make bad design decisions in order to try and prevent you from just flying in, winning, and flying out. Would it be elitist for people to want actual content instead of one chest of full epics? There is a grey area and people feel, and Blizz is seeming to agree, that flight falls out of the grey area and into the &quot;bad&quot; area. Making us kill every mob on the way to one elite that will take 20 min to get to for a weak reward would also fall into the &quot;bad&quot; area. There is a middle ground. <br />
<br />
Well, the middle ground is already there, you are free to not fly, so the &quot;content&quot; you crave is already there..<br />
Whats this obsession with forcing other people to do it your way? why do you get off at the idea that others get restricted in how they enjoy the game when it doesn't affect you? The ONLY people that got shafted by this where kiddy gankers on pvp servers (and those actually use flying mounts more often then not, since they shy away from fights where they dont have a significant advantage)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The truth is Blizz made a mistake by ever allowing you to play the way you have grown accustomed. That is why it has taken them so long to try and fix it. It cannot be fixed if they want to bring back that feeling we had in Vanilla or even Isle of Quel'Danas (which was a flight-restricted zone after flying was implemented even at max level). Timeless Isle was an attempt to ease us into no flying. They have made this decision because they feel it will make for a more enjoyable experience for you to play the way they want instead of the way you do now. If every quest is fly in, win, fly out, they all feel the same. They basically are all the same. Do you really think doing the same thing 100 times is more fun than taking the same time to do 10 things that vary and net you the same reward?<br />
<br />
Vanilla wasnt that much fun though, lots of time wasted on travelling, that feeling is called &quot;rose tinted goggles&quot;.<br />
Like i said before, If you dont like flying when questing then just use a ground mount and let other people decide for themselves, why is it so hard to understand? <br />
And far more enjoyable? Thats subjective: I dont really enjoy running around and wasting my time (some people actually have a job), not everyone is a masochist.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also imo, mats won't be ruined by this. They can simply a) make nodes give more mats or b) make crafting cost less mats. In many cases, this will make gathering professions actually worth more. Mats were too abundant imo and it became the better choice to buy them because they were so cheap. This made having two crafting professions instead of a crafting + gathering profession the better decision. *That* takes away choice.<br />
<br />
I cant remember talking about gathering, altough that &quot;problem&quot; can easily be overcome with different solutions that dont remove choices from players.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, the level 90 boost is definitely an &quot;instant gratification situation&quot; (trademarked) but it is also for outdated content. Leveling to 90 is something that hasn't been current for most people (outside of alts) for over a year. By offering the boost with the xpac, it allows people to make an alt that they may not have done if they had to spend the time to level it to 90. This may help add tanks or healers to the game which is a plus. It also gives people something to gear up and practice with in the gap between xpacs. I personally love my MW Monk and I doubt I would have spent the time to level it to 90 after I already had 5+ 90s. There is no doubt the boost allows you to skip content. But it is old content and is *not* the same as not allowing flight in WoD.<br />
Again, I assume you are referring to other posters here, I dont really care about levelling boosts since the game starts at max level for me (after playing for 9+ years I dont care about levelling that much anyway).<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with instant gratification, I seldom quest after I get to max level anyway (only when the game forces me to), I prefer playing with friends instead, I still haven't seen any valid argument as to why people like me are forced to suddenly change their playstyle without there being a good reason for it, the &quot;content&quot; you and blizzard wish for is already there if you want to play like that, stop forcing it on the rest of us.<br />

Like i said before, If you dont like flying when questing then just use a ground mount and let other people decide for themselves, why is it so hard to understand?Because as i already said, that's like telling a construction worker he can use a mining pack while jackhammers are available. Also as has been stated by a previous poster Blizzard bottlenecked themselves into having to design with the flying aspect in mind. It messes up questing flow a lot. The game has never been aimed at instant gratification, WoW has always been about the grind to progression. Flying damages a fair bit of that factor, you can still choose to skip quest text and mash through everything, but you aren't getting the full intended experience.<br />
<br />
And far more enjoyable? Thats subjective: I dont really enjoy running around and wasting my time (some people actually have a job), not everyone is a masochist.I play WoW once or twice a week and both in Vanilla and now time management within my short periods of play has never been an issue, that's possibly the most retarded argument I've seen on the matter yet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Again, I assume you are referring to other posters here, I dont really care about levelling boosts since the game starts at max level for me (after playing for 9+ years I dont care about levelling that much anyway).Well if you don't care about levelling then you're making a problem out of nothing.<br />
<br />
<br />
This has nothing to do with instant gratification, I seldom quest after I get to max level anyway (only when the game forces me to), I prefer playing with friends instead, I still haven't seen any valid argument as to why people like me are forced to suddenly change their playstyle without there being a good reason for it, the &quot;content&quot; you and blizzard wish for is already there if you want to play like that, stop forcing it on the rest of us.Why do you want a valid argument of which been given multiple? You have just responded to loads with mostly strawman excuses and I don't know why it means so fucking much to you if as you say &quot;it has nothing to do with instant gratification&quot;.<br />
<br />
Your playstyle simply isn't optimal, it's against the games core philosophy and generates a lot of precautions that needn't have been there to begin with, it also avoids cowardly PVP'ing and encourages World PVP. If those reasons aren't valid to you, then I could care less if you unsubscribe, because you're a self-centered single-minded idiot. But you won't unsubscribe, WoW isn't a game you just quit after 9 years, when the Expansion comes you'll predictably buy it, play it and never question it again. You're only acting upon impulses to question Blizzard's actions because you clearly have nothing better to do with your life. For one who implies he has a job you are going to a good effort of showing that arguing with people who are smarter and more logical than you is actually the only job you have outside of playing WoW.<br />

I'm not on the &quot;WoW is dying&quot; bandwagon, but it is very easy to see that blizzard has had a very serious reduction in subscription revenue due to problems with player retention. <br />
<br />
It is very likely that it has hurt them financially.The servers used to host WoW cost collectively about 500 dollars a week to maintain, or roughly 160 subscribers. The only way Blizzard could be hurt financially is for people in the majority (as in, more than four million from now) to stop throwing money at them, which won't conceivably happen. Then there's people who pay for mounts, pets and other stuff. The majority of Blizzard's expenses are in developing new content and paying staff.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, but removing flying after it was already an integral part of the game is like giving the construction worker a pick axe, and telling him hes only allowed to use the pick axe when there is a pile of functioning jackhammers on the other side of the room.<br />

If that's all your worried about then it's pretty much a non issue. Also flying was NEVER an integral part of the game, it's an extra that Blizzard built a couple things around (Netherwing Ledge, Sha'tari Skyguard etc). Flying outside of those exceptions never factors directly into gameplay.<br />

<br />
Get to level 60, bam, done with Azeroth, can now fly in Azeroth. When BC came out, couldn't fly until you were level 70, same with Wrath, same with Pandaria.<br />
<br />
You aren't being dis-serviced at all from past to present in the regard you show concern for. Besides it's those players who spam run dungeons anyway and questing is simply a way to get some additional XP during queue times which for tanks and healers isn't even a necessity.<br />

When did Blizzard ever say mounted combat would be a thing?<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
When people say it's costing another raid tier, it's not a joke... It's probably partially true, up to a point.They have multiple different teams, and a single mount model that has the benefit of a reused skeleton takes at most twenty minutes of Blizzard's time. There's no mechanics to sort out nor dialogue to write or voice acting to wait on. May be one or two new SFX.<br />
<br />
A raid tier requires balancing for current player gear level, calculations of varying degrees, several new models and rigorous testing. A mount requires a quick easy effort by some of the 3D modelling team and the rest is out of effected hands. It is a joke whether the ones saying it believe so or not. It's also not exceptionally humorous after the first time, let alone the fiftieth.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they'll fly while in movement and land when they stand still. The Engineering mounts are also a good example, they did different thinks on the land and in the air.

<br />
Hmm... perhaps there maybe a compromise of some sort, we'll have to see. I was thinking maybe flight paths use your current flight mount instead of the low-poly gryphon or chimaera models.<br />

Also contrary to your poor representation of Blizzard's ideology this will reduce PVP ganking because you can no longer swoop in, kill someone and then fuck off before they get mad and seek vengeance. It's not like you are being denied the mounts in totality, you can still ride around on all your alleged dope mounts, you just can't fly.<br />

Cataclysm we got to beta test LFR while raiding constantly nerfed content for months on end. MoP we get charms of good fortune, valor point upgrades, and daily quest hubs.

<br />
That is absolutely 100% incorrect. Modern MMO's that do NOT have flying mounts in them ARE a lot of fun, just as much as vanilla WOW, if not moreso, mainly because there are no flying mounts. FF14 is a great example, at this current time. Traveling is immersive, engrossing, and keeps the blood pressure low. The WOW you know and love today, that has fast paced flying skip over the story crap, is NOT the game Blizzard originally created. It's morphed to follow the current societal trends that you seem to enjoy, with quick action FPS and instantly gratifying games that you give you more and more in less and less time.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is by no means perfect in trying to go back to more traditional roleplaying game roots (instant 90 says hi) but this is a step in that direction, whether you like it or not.<br />
<br />
And the argument of &quot;if you don't like flying, don't use&quot; does not apply in reality when faced with human nature. Games are supposed to provide you with limitations so they can tell a certain story and guide you in a specific direction. If you don't like that direction that WOW is heading back toward, then this is no longer the game for you.<br />
<br />
Not that I want people leaving -- I like my worlds populated. But if I had to choose between less players, more engrossing gameplay and more players, less engrossing gameplay, I pick the former.</div></div><hr />

Ground mounts can't fly. You have a chance to be dismounted on a ground mount, and it still means you are on the ground, you can't just go past everything. Also how would they get money out of chumps if they didn't have mounts to give out? Lel.<br />

Yeah lately I have seen a lot of back tracking by Blizz, the one that comes to mind is their touting of how awesome Garrisons are going to be to now only allowing them in the starting zones for each faction.. Wonder what next they will back track on besides flying..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">War30</div><div class="date">2014-04-26, 05:09 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is the most retarded line of logic I've seen yet and that's saying something.<br />
<br />
Ground mounts can't fly. You have a chance to be dismounted on a ground mount, and it still means you are on the ground, you can't just go past everything. Also how would they get money out of chumps if they didn't have mounts to give out? Lel.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
They don't want to have to design max level progression content like they've said they're adding around flying mounts, put your tinfoil hat theories away.How about, the whiny entitled brats like you who act like they give a fuck. I'm not going to quit just because they cut flying mounts, I'm not that self-centered and spoilt. I could care less if anyone complaining about this unsubscribes, no one who enjoys the game for what it is cares about your petty fucking desires or demands you miserable gratification-seeking twat.<br />
<br />
Also honesty is overrated. People will always complain, and this isn't really dishonesty, it's more that they just changed their mind on the matter. I admire your enthusiasm for some sort of shortlived rebellion, but it's ultimately futile. The people complaining will have no qualms with buying the Xpac, playing it and being grounded once it arrives, they are complaining like you are because they simply have nothing better to do with their lives. I'm not even trying to defend Blizzard, they're a big company now they don't need defending, but if i enjoy something it's calling out people for being mindnumbingly idiotic or/and entitled.<br />
<br />
I really feel sorry for you for you are the one whining and complaining. I'm old enough to UNDERSTAND what is right and what is deceiving. I'm not a sheep like you. There has been no shred of proof why this feature is being removed. Why all of a sudden the change? Burning crusade and Lich king had no problems with it because we had to level up 10 lvs. The problem was with Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria where we were only leveling 5 levels which we burned through fast. That was there problem on why people were getting through the content fast. So tell me what are you afraid of? That people will wise up for the first time since this game was released and go play something else and ruin you gaming experience with those you raid with. I&quot;m paying for a FULL gaming experience. Correction. WE ARE ALL PAYING for a full gaming experience and we as customers should get that. <br />
<br />
You know what I really see happening. Remember this, OK. What BLIZZARD is really doing is that they are going to charge you the LOYAL consumer 25 bucks in there store to use flying mounts. This is there plan. I have foreseen this and everyone better be prepared for this for if you buy this feature you are a bunch of idiots.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now don't get me wrong. I understand the appeal, the thought, and loved it at the time of its conception. However, that said, with time, it's only proven to be a burden to overall designs and really weakened the feel of this &quot;persistent&quot; world our virtual selves exist within. Ultimately this has created a very disconnected, CoD-esque experience where you hop in, queue up for many of your tasks, and any time you have to venture into the world you simply plop your ass on a flying mount with virtually no risk to yourself.<br />
<br />
One word; BORING.<br />
<br />
You play any MMORPG like WoW to experience a world and partake in events, interact with players, and become a part of something beyond your every day existence. That's what was so magical about WoW and many MMOs when we all first began. Now we can't recall what made it so and it's really just that simple. They've become too predictable, too easy, and provide instant-gratification like it's going out of style. Flying is a part of the problem and nowhere near the solution to ANYTHING short of one's own inflated sense of self-importance.<br />
<br />
Really, it wasn't the challenges that turned many away. It wasn't the interactions and networking that turned us away. There is a reason games like Dark Souls can be so popular this day and age. Return to our roots with better story-telling, better combat, challenges(beyond &quot;heroic&quot; modes) better graphics, more immersive gameplay. That's what gamers in general want.<br />
<br />
I'd love to just be punished for trying to level. I want it to be grueling, hurtful to my self-esteem. I want to bloody cry. I remember trying to level in Stranglethorn during Vanilla. YOU KNOW HOW EFFING DEGRADING THAT WAS!?<br />
<br />
And it only made it all the sweeter when I maxed out and began punishing my enemies in return.</div></div><hr />

Personally, I want an engineer mount to be gained from maxing our MoP ranch stuff. I want a riding lawnmower that has normal walking speed or less, like the fishing turtle. One can only wish.<br />
<br />
But I don't really understand the hate for not having flying, I am leveling a character without heirlooms right now out of boredom, I think it is a valid point about being able to skip content with flying. Hell, who knows we might see the return of group quests, normal leveling quests whose difficulty actually requires 2-5 people... doubtful but one could hope. <br />
I won't say that flying has taken all the immersion out of the game, or that it is my primary reason for feeling like there is much less after all these years, but if I had to pick and choose my battles across gold plated 103's wandering around to get into a stronghold, kill a target and escape without a repair bill or just fly in cloak glider my way past everything and kill him... I would choose the former. Maybe all those good memories of gold plated Worgen kicking my behind years ago has my nostalgia running also.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you that we need a challenge while leveling. But once all that is over we should be able to use our flying mounts.<br />
Let me say this. I have played tons of other MMO's like Star Wars Galaxy, AION, Warhammer online, Rift, Star Wars the Old Republic, Guild Wars 1 and 2, Final Fantasy 11 and 14 and you know something they all suck and then something funny happens. I return to WOW. The reason being that I have FREEDOM using flying mounts while these other games suck at it. Its the main reason these games suck and its by FAR the #1 reason people began playing this game since burning crusade. If Blizzard removes this they will become like every other MMO game and people will LEAVE. I will bet you on this.<br />

Yeah lately I have seen a lot of back tracking by Blizz, the one that comes to mind is their touting of how awesome Garrisons are going to be to now only allowing them in the starting zones for each faction.. Wonder what next they will back track on besides flying..As a small time game developer myself, I understand that backtracking is inevitable, though thankfully I don't have a playerbase so dense and rabid that I'll never have a chance to say anything without it being used against me in the future somehow.<br />
<br />
You have ideas but later on when shit starts getting real you have to be more realistic. For a basic example I recently released a game that had multi-planetary exploration and sidequests planned along with a driving plot and several optional things, I realized that for with what time I had some features would have to be cut, so a lot of optional content had to be sacrificed in order for the main story and the gameplay to remain pleasing and so I could feasibly release it within the deadline I had set. Games are defined by the limits they are going to inevitably have because a game that does everything doesn't exist and if it did no other game would need to exist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So basically, we went from &quot;you will get flying in 6.1&quot; to - &quot;we're not sure now&quot;. Sounds like never to me. I am so glad I am unsubbed right now. I'm not paying to run the same raid and content for a year plus, and then paying again for an expansion that is removing more shit than it adds. <br />
<br />
I don't give a damn if Blizzard thinks that flying was a mistake. Its part of the game now and has been for 7 years. They handled it masterfully in TBC, WoTLK and let us use it for leveling in Cataclysm which was great. MoP was a big step back to be honest. It is why I and so many others hardly leveled any alts. I mean, who wants to run the same stale content all over again? <br />
<br />
All Blizzard needed to do was adopt either the WoTLK, TBC or Cata method of dealing with flying and pretty much everyone is happy. <br />
<br />
It is still only a few players that know about no flying. Come first 2 weeks into WoD release there will be a huge backlash when the masses learn that there won't be flying at all. <br />
<br />
I do admit I miss WoW, but this game has lost so much of what made it fun, I fear it will never be worth subscribing again.</div></div><hr />

I'm old enough to UNDERSTAND what is right and what is deceiving. I'm not a sheep like you.Ahahaha, oh my god. I play at most 5 hours of WoW a week. I'm about as far from sheep as you can get. I'm just being logical and as real as I can be. There's not much profit to be earned from aggravating half of your fanbase.<br />
There has been no shred of proof why this feature is being removed. Why all of a sudden the change? Burning crusade and Lich king had no problems with it because we had to level up 10 lvs. The problem was with Cataclysm and Mists of Pandaria where we were only leveling 5 levels which we burned through fast.

That people will wise up for the first time since this game was released and go play something else and ruin you gaming experience with those you raid with.I don't even raid you fucking retard and I seldom play with other people which makes your assumption an ignorant and useless addendum to your inquiry. Not to mention you can't FLY IN RAIDS ANYWAY so I have no idea what that has to do with it. WoW for me is an experience I enjoy mostly with my own company, not everyone is an attention craving dickweed whose social circle is the only valuable asset they have in life. I certainly do have enough free time to play WoW relogiously but it's a game I find better in smaller doses.<br />
<br />
I don't know why they haven't decided to do this until now, but I don't see why there'd be any reason to drag out the content like you're implying they are going to do, your paying by the month for the month. They are probably going to damage sales more with this change than improve them. It's immersion I'm more interested in, which flying takes away from. I'm not afraid of anything, but I'd like the world not to feel as dead if that answers your question.<br />
I&quot;m paying for a FULL gaming experience. Correction. WE ARE ALL PAYING for a full gaming experience and we as customers should get that.Your payment entitles you to jack shit. They could do things far more controversial and get away with it, if you don't like it, then you are more than welcome to cancel your subscription, no one is going to be upset if you leave. Besides there are plenty of good games that have flight and it is integral from the start, a new one that's coming out soon looks quite promising that I found out about on this thread. World of Warcraft was never designed with flight in mind, since it seems they are only not allowing you to fly only in Draenor after all then the appeal for me is sort of lost, but again it's very much a technical hurdle and as stated they've designed max level outdoor content in Draenor that flying would jeopardize. You like flying? Cool, go back to Azeroth or outland to go nuts with it, if you don't like questing, awesome! Go straight to raiding which also doesn't allow flight...?<br />
<br />
What are YOU afraid of?<br />
<br />
<br />
You know what I really see happening. Remember this, OK. What BLIZZARD is really doing is that they are going to charge you the LOYAL consumer 25 bucks in there store to use flying mounts. This is there plan. I have foreseen this and everyone better be prepared for this for if you buy this feature you are a bunch of idiots.That's a possibility, but unlikely. We'll have to see but I didn't consider that, again it just sounds like some sort of tinfoil hat theory, Blizzard has never in the past given pay to win functionality, it's always been cosmetic or things that won't effect others. If you look at all their previous things they've added, it's never been to disservice those from a competitive standpoint those who simply can't afford it. I'm not counting Horde / Alliance PVP imbalance and faction change because that's a result of players and it was implemented originally to help circumvent that, not extort it.<br />
<br />
There's no REMEMBER THIS for a thing which has not yet happened. Levelling to 90 for a fee doesn't effect the experience of other players. Nor does taking away flight for all players, or allowing you to change your race, faction, appearance, name server et cetera.<br />
<br />
What your tinfoiling about is as likely to happen as every other crackpot &quot;premium feature&quot; we've heard about. Blizzard's only pay to win feature is paying for the game subscription, which again, doesn't effect anyone it shouldn't.<br />
<br />
You can stop trying so hard to find avarice in what Blizzard does, make you seem like a zealous anti-sheep which is ironic considering your half-baked assumption about me. You're being fucking ridiculous. This almost seems like you pulled it out of the air to avoid admitting the unfortunate reality that you're an idiot, which was a futile practice to begin with and this only helped further show how rooted you are in ... I dunno, what are you even trying to do except complain and ask for an answer as to why this has happened despite multitudes being offered?</div></div><hr />

Why I was never a sucker for buying crap from Blizz's store.. lol<br />
<br />
As for your second part can totally understand sometimes how and why these things happen, but unfortunately as you know this is the WoW community you are talking about, as Obi Wan Kenobi once said &quot;Mos Isely a wretched hive of scum and villainy.&quot; That is how I see some of the WoW community, though I have seen folks talk about other games communities being even worse.. <br />
<br />
I think (and probably wrong) you would have thought Blizz would have learnt by now not to hype certain aspects of the game so much especially when it comes to gaming communities that will tear apart any bit of info they get and go either yay or boo.. <br />
<br />
And even more so when it comes to the point that they can't make it happen for whatever reason..</div></div><hr />

My most enjoyable time in game was during the days of no flying whatsoever, so I see no reason to dismiss it now. I actually wish it had never been implemented, it makes the game world feel tiny and largely insignificant to me. Plus we can still use all our mounts on land, we aren't being &quot;crippled&quot; like that one angry guy said. Not flying is not being crippled, come on.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LlionDS</div><div class="date">2014-04-26, 06:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You introduced flying to make the game feel more immersive and now you back step by saying that it somehow takes away from the experience. The example you gave, &quot;Having to invade a fort&quot; is lousy. I rarely see a fort with the boss right outside, but id rather fly to that fort than get smacked around and dazed before i make it near the door and get ganked cause i had to fight off the adds that dismounted me. Professions suffer because the process of gathering herbs, and mining nodes will take longer, increasing their costs and hurting the markets as a result. You're making the exact same mistake you did with Pandaria and that's that Questing is not the soul content of the game. No matter how you spin it, killing 3a 3b 3c 1d is not revolutionary content. <br />
<br />
What blows me away even more, is the fact that you refuse to add the immersion of having 3D combat. Fights you can engage in the air as well as on the ground. There's something to be said about having an epic flight up a cliff, shooting down mobs while you fly to arrive at the top, enter a fortress and kill a boss for a quest. There can be Anti Aircraft missiles that try to shoot you down if you don't evade them. Skyriders and Grons that try to swat you outta the air. The game does not have to be designed for the ground only, this sounds like the same quest system you've always had and are not innovating one little bit. You could have more elaborate hiding places like you did for those small treasures in pandaria, maybe even make them appraisable, turning them into loot, items, potions, zone buffs or flat out exp. Rares could require mid air combat, you could add dynamic abilities to flight as well, like fatigue, sprinting, diving, and have it all dependent on that kind of system. <br />
<br />
I think the real answer was, you wanted to just make an expansion. Nothing of particular note, just something with the same kind of framework as the last, easy to develop, low cost, and whats easier than designing the same content you have for the last 4 expansions. =/</div></div><hr />

Removes flying...<br />
<br />
At the end of the day however they want to cut it whatever &quot;benefits&quot; (and I don't believe there are any) removing flying brings to the game, they are still removing a feature that lots of people use, that lots of people like, that adds far more to the game that it takes away. Removal is removal, however much lipstick they put on it.<br />
<br />
And it's gone from coming back in 6.1, to 6.1 with legendary style quest to them not knowing when it's coming back, well from my perspective the idea of a continent let alone a whole expansion of Timeless Isle 2.0 fills me with dread, so I'll tell them what, they can let me know when flying is back and I'll resub.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're doing this rather than adding more complex AI, more dangers to the skies, more aerial defenses etc etc. We have been leveling on the ground in all expansions apart from Cataclysm, pretending it'll be new and amazing = being optimistic to the point of being naive. <br />
<br />
It won't bring back the feeling you had in Vanilla, no matter how rabidly you try to defend their decision and make yourself believe it will. Mounted combat, monsters patrolling the skies, mobs actually taking notice of you flying and acting upon it and so on would be innovative. Removing a feature that made the game unique for a long time and calling it doing what's best for the game = the easier way out. They could minimize sub losses from alienating pro-flying players by actually putting their backs into content being more appealing WITH flying included rather than putting their hopes in people being addicted enough to stick with them even as they backtrack.<br />
<br />
And before some genius comes along saying that the pro-flying players quitting isn't bad for the game...of course it's bloody bad for the game, ALL sub losses are bad. The people being anti-flying enough to unsub, did so 7-8 years ago, and this game peaked at a whopping 12 million players despite flying being around. <br />
<br />
The issue is not in flying being available at max level. The issue is Blizzard losing their innovative streak and ability to renew themselves by moving forward rather than backwards. And guess what, the people not giving a single shit about content and just rushing to max level and instanced content, will keep doing just that. With or without flying. As someone that cares about immersing myself and experiencing content, I have never been stumped by flying. On the contrary.<br />
<br />
Flying has been the dream of human beings for as long as we have been intelligent enough to take notice of the flight of birds. But hey, it's logical to &quot;encourage&quot; exploration and &quot;increasing&quot; freedom by removing it from a fantasy world where it has been available for almost as long as said fantasy world has been in existence!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bizarre Monkey</div><div class="date">2014-04-26, 06:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You introduced flying to make the game feel more immersive and now you back step by saying that it somehow takes away from the experience.Not sure if they ever said flying was added for immersion, they probably said it was a cool idea they thought would be fun, I have no idea though.<br />
<br />
The example you gave, &quot;Having to invade a fort&quot; is lousy. I rarely see a fort with the boss right outside, but id rather fly to that fort than get smacked around and dazed before i make it near the door and get ganked cause i had to fight off the adds that dismounted me.You'll just have to be a bit less lazy, mate. <br />
Professions suffer because the process of gathering herbs, and mining nodes will take longer, increasing their costs and hurting the markets as a result.That's such an insubstantial concern it almost hurt my brain to calculate. It all comes out even, takes more time, costs more money, and everything inflates accordingly.<br />
You're making the exact same mistake you did with Pandaria and that's that Questing is not the soul content of the game. No matter how you spin it, killing 3a 3b 3c 1d is not revolutionary content.Shrug! The &quot;Soul content of the game&quot; is a matter of subjective observation.<br />
<br />
<br />
What blows me away even more, is the fact that you refuse to add the immersion of having 3D combat. Fights you can engage in the air as well as on the ground. There's something to be said about having an epic flight up a cliff, shooting down mobs while you fly to arrive at the top, enter a fortress and kill a boss for a quest.That's a lot of effort to implement. <br />
There can be Anti Aircraft missiles that try to shoot you down if you don't evade them.You mean like the Fel Cannons in BC? Yeah whatever happened to those. Thing was you couldn't evade them because the game isn't hitbox focused and the amount of time and money to make the game hitbox focused is a large and ambitious cost, also for someone like me who lives in Australia without any local servers the game becomes unplayable because of latency issues. <br />
Skyriders and Grons that try to swat you outta the air. The game does not have to be designed for the ground only, this sounds like the same quest system you've always had and are not innovating one little bit.Draenor doesn't have floating islands all around like Outland did, and again THERE'S NO FLYING UNTIL MAX LEVEL ANYWAY so this point is null. If you mean beyond max level, yeah fair enough. <br />
You could have more elaborate hiding places like you did for those small treasures in pandaria, maybe even make them appraisable, turning them into loot, items, potions, zone buffs or flat out exp. Rares could require mid air combat, you could add dynamic abilities to flight as well, like fatigue, sprinting, diving, and have it all dependent on that kind of system.Those are all great ideas. Though hefty to implement, I liked the idea of dogfights when they were first mentioned.<br />
<br />
<br />
I think the real answer was, you wanted to just make an expansion. Nothing of particular note, just something with the same kind of framework as the last, easy to develop, low cost, and whats easier than designing the same content you have for the last 4 expansions. =/I wish people would stop making assumptions they can't prove are true, it's really quite childish. Though I agree that at first glance that is what I'd think too. I try to remain logical and fair when debating these sort of things because being singleminded like a few of the legendary idiots on this thread is extremely brutish, and I am too well dressed to partake in that kind of barbaric idolatry. I'll admit that if the sort of innovation you mentioned above was available as a choice between it and no flight, especially knowing now that no flight is only for Draenor and not everywhere like I had hoped, then I would have gone with epic dogfights and secrets and stuff.<br />
<br />
I find often that despite my pessimistic nature I am rather easy to please. I also tend to not become entitled because I pay 15 dollars a week so that other people do kind of annoys me, which is why I'm on a verbal rampage on this thread.</div></div><hr />

They're doing this rather than adding more complex AI, more dangers to the skies, more aerial defenses etc etc. We have been leveling on the ground in all expansions apart from Cataclysm, pretending it'll be new and amazing = being optimistic to the point of being naive. <br />

It won't bring back the feeling you had in Vanilla, no matter how rabidly you try to defend their decision and make yourself believe it will.

agreed, flight adds another dimension to the game, why not iterate on the current model?<br />
<br />
hell, we were promised air combat in wrath even. the skies arent dangerous? make them dangerous! make people decide what path is best: on the ground, or in the air.<br />
<br />
also, from a design perspective if you remove flight it severely limits the kinds of zones you can create. no stuff like icecrown, storm peaks, deepholm, etc.</div></div><hr />

Has there been a significant portion in the debate saying they want flying to be removed just because classic-hurr-durr? Not because flying right away lets you avoid pretty much all danger and environment design.<br />
Doubt it, too be honest.</div></div><hr />

As flying in some way. has trivialized quest content and PVP content so if Blizzard wants to revive brutality of WoD, they probably will ban flight until the end-game patch. Somehow, for players who want to sky-explore WoD world, I suggest that each player will have one-hour flight time every day. This buff will reset in middle-night.</div></div><hr />

I realized it was meant about person to person, but the basis of it still applies to our scenario.<br />
<br />
I don't give myself gaudy moral expectations because in most scenarios I'm a fairly ornery dude. I mean someone called me a psychopath and I've had a fair few people refer to me as 'sick' or something. Mostly religious fanatics who really are fun to play around with but I've made no effort to preserve my reputation because I find the concepts of morals entirely useless in a Universe where the value of right and wrong are subjective when it comes to human judgement. I was pointing out that you were stepping out of your moral turf as an addendum to what I had said already and it just sort of fit well.<br />
<br />
I could have not mentioned it entirely, but I did anyway because I felt like it. It's also a rather baseless signature for me, since i don't often encounter people outside of my family. it also has a very 'internet tough guy' sort of vibe to it with the whole 'YOU ARE NOT ANONYMOUS' clause. There's no laws that prevent you from telling someone they are an idiot, I don't make threats on the internet because I have been here long enough to understand that playing the 'internet tough guy' is idiotic and will only get you laughed at.<br />

Removal of flying is one of the best things which could happen, though. And should have been done 4 weeks after flying was added, before it got as entrenched as it is now. :s</div></div><hr />

The sig has nothing to do with being a internet &quot;tough guy&quot; (you might know what that means, I don't), it has to do with laws and people being under the impression that they are anonymous and can't be touched just because they have a screen in front of them. <br />

Yep...But you know what I see...Now its ground mounts. They will add another 3 or 4 to there shop before the next expansion is released which will probably involve &quot;Argus&quot; planet of the Eredar/Dranaei. This time they will remove ground mounts. So the the same pattern persists. Buy mounts next expansion you wont use them. This time they probably sell you a backpack where you carry your friend this time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One of the best things to you. But in what way? How will it be the best thing that could happen over say...improvements to mobs? Mounted combat? Danger in the skies etc etc?<br />
<br />
How has the game been ruined from flying for these past 8 years? I have yet to see anyone give a proper answer to that question other than &quot;I loved vanilla!!&quot;. WPVP? It's dead, has been ever since instanced pvp appeared. More people out and about? LFR/LFD keeps people only caring about instanced content in cities anyway. People caring about being in the world keep playing that way with flyers. I see people flying back and forth all the time on my busy server. More immersive content? We have been grounded for content so many times now that I fail to see how it can still hold mystery beyond the first time either way. That's where them making AI better, changing how mobs work, adding more danger to both air and ground and so on comes in. Hell, check out what Archeage does with their flying and mounts overall.</div></div><hr />

Basically if they could they would take flying out of the game since it shouldn't have been introduced in the first place.<br />
<br />
Some person saying it shouldn't have been introduced in the first place is basically saying that the past 8 years shouldn't have been.<br />
<br />
It's not that simple. Flying has been around for way longer than not, and the game flourished either way. It's here, people have grown to expect and enjoy it, but rather than taking it to the next level they backtrack and say &quot;It shouldn't have been here in the first place, lol&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Alternatively, from a flying mount, you fly over the gate, see some guy whose name is highlighted, land on top of him, kill him, and then fly away.<br />

Exactly, so thinking that the removal of flight rather than expanding on the idea will bring something that we haven't already had during leveling so many times isn't exactly clever. <br />
<br />
And that old &quot;you probably don't like the game to begin with&quot;-crap is nothing more than that...crap. I have loved this game since I started, and as such I KNOW what I enjoy and don't. I enjoy leveling and have nothing against being grounded at times, but I also love flying and the freedom it brings over taxis.<br />
<br />
Tell me, what will they be doing that they haven't been doing for the past 8 years when it comes to grounded content? 5 minutes of picking up a quest objective? Please, that's overstating it...it took me a whopping 2 minutes to get from questgiver to quest objective and beginning the journey back last night as I was, you guessed it, grounded. What I did the rest of the time I spent? Oh I don't know...I kept questing and doing what I enjoyed? Same as I have been for 6 years with and without flyers?</div></div><hr />

In their minds it was a different drink. In reality it would be the exact same drink on the menu, but with a slightly heavier amaretto and fresh lemon or lime juice as opposed to Rose's.<br />
<br />
Give it a chance. It is going to happen. I see the benefits and the conveniences of flying. There will be times I will miss it. A few people are expressing arguments better than others.

As if it brings more weight to your opinions than anyone elses to be old, but...28 years old here, heavily against them backtracking for easy solutions rather than expanding and improving. I have friends that are neutral about it, love the idea, and hate the idea. And no, they're not very young, and they ALL enjoy and love the game as it is and has been for the past 9 years. That includes all those years WITH flying. You use a lot of ad hominem and it's never clever.</div></div><hr />

Really? Fun? You sure? Because I remember those long queue times to play. Crappy connection, being booted out to start the same nonsense over. The world was boring. No exploration, no back story, and it took forever to get a mount. So I leveled a character to 60 did all 5 mans canceled and waited until Burning Crusade where they introduced Flying mounts and I never stopped playing since. Well until I see all the details on what is going to happen in the new Expansion.</div></div><hr />

From the ground you approach a fort with guards at the gate. You charge and are able to dispatch them and sneak in a side hallway. You methodically take out packs of roaming sentries, and some of them shout at you as they run toward you. You notice they’re in the middle of practicing dark and forbidden magics, and you take a moment to disrupt their ritual. Dashing into the main courtyard you spot your target, sneaking and fighting your way to him--and with a forceful slash--the fort’s captain is vanquished, and as guards are alerted you fight your way out, glorious and triumphant in your success.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, from a flying mount, you fly over the gate, see some guy whose name is highlighted, land on top of him, kill him, and then fly away.<br />
<br />
Ok, so yet again they operate under the false assumption that being restricted to the ground equals immersion. I guess they are trying to make an example here but seriously, how about comparing two equal situations? Comparing the same situation from two completely different point of views, where the first one is told from the perspective of someone caring about the lore and immersion while the second one doesn't give a shit about it. I could write a one page essay of how much cooler I think it is being able to do option #2 (yes, from a perspective of immersion), yet they choose to assume that the fly-guy doesn't give a crap about it and work from there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Being efficient is great, being clever is great, and using your cleverness to be efficient is great, but how many of us have done the Tillers dailies up on the cliffside where the Hozen are, and waited for packs to pass by before setting down right where you’re supposed to, use whatever thingamabob you’re supposed to, and then lift off ASAP hoping-hoping-hoping nothing aggros? How many of us have become furious when we actually have to fight something!? Is that clever gameplay? Is that being good at playing the game, or is it using a mechanic to avoid having to play it? Is that what the game should be, and what our expectations should be as gamers playing it?<br />

Please do, I want to know how giving people the ability to choose exactly when and how they approach all content (or rather, the final quest objective, while avoiding pretty much all danger) is as immersive as experiencing it in the way it's designed to be.<br />

<br />
Timeless Isle is fun? Running around and mindlessly killing mobs that whilst they can one-shot you aren't very challenging when it comes to mechanics is fun...?<br />
<br />
The way it is designed to be can only include grounded movement...? If they are so dead set on me moving through a door rather than going down onto a rooftop and making my way inside from there then they can leave flying be and mount defenses that make it impossible to just swoop in. THEIR lack of ability to make content challenging and immersive can't be blamed on flying being available. Just look at the Landfall faction hubs, those have aerial defenses and it works pretty well. <br />
<br />
Roof or ground, there could be mobs that stops you from taking the faster way if that's what it all comes down to.</div></div><hr />

Doesn't really matter whether or not fly or ground-guy cares about immersion.<br />
If given the choice, both lore-guy and no-fucks-given-guy would still be compelled to fly because it'd make them far more efficient.<br />
Denying this in an MMO is foolish.<br />

Makes as much sense as expecting PvPers not to buy equal-to Conquest gear if sold without a rating requirement. &quot;Well, you could have waited until 2k rating before buying it! Choice!&quot;<br />

I've stopped caring about raiding a while ago.<br />
I don't care to be grounded when I just want to spend a few hours farming some mats, or *gasp* doing archaeology (NEVER ON GROUND MOUNTS, NEVER EVER EVER) while listening to a book and just shutting down my mind for a while.<br />
I don't care about any quest past the leveling experience, have they learned fucking nothing from the first patch of MoP and the daily mindfuck?<br />
I absolutely hate the islands and everything they stand for.<br />

I don't log in to wow because I enjoy it, I log in to wow because the sheer amount of resources I've dumped into it over the years, and abandoning it feels akin to hitting an old dog.<br />
I don't give one single fuck about their design decisions or how they intend people to play the game. I understand their reasoning, but I don't fucking care.<br />
<br />
I just can't understand why the fuck they insist on polarizing their players this way when it's not a clear-cut majority that wants to be grounded, it's split pretty equally.<br />
<br />
Again and again they've dodged actually answering the question on if they intend to block flying from here on out in all future content. A simple yes or no on 6.1 would have silenced most of these threads/posts, but no, they just &quot;don't know&quot;.<br />

Well that fucking does it. I've been suckered (baited really) into buying the expansion, because of a goddamn flying mount of all things. I'll play it till cap with one character, then I'm done with wow.<br />

The most polished nostalgia trip ever kept me going because of the shallow illusion of freedom it had for a while.

Essentially you're saying that since some people want to skip content, they should be able to skip content.<br />
That this has a very substantial effect on people who would like to experience the new content &quot;properly&quot; is of no concern.<br />
<br />
You say choice, I say reality. Allow people to skip quests, they will. Whether or not it'd compromise their experience.<br />
Reaper of Souls for Diablo 3, &quot;Yeah we unlocked all pre-boss Waypoints for those who don't want to experience Westmarch.&quot;<br />
<br />
You think people would still be compelled to wade through hundreds of enemies to get there? Who cares about the areas when there are boss lewt to be earned.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's a cheap solution to a problem that WON'T be fixed no matter what they do, but it's sure easier than making changes to how mobs work and adding more danger above the ground.<br />
<br />
Problem is that players will skip content if allowed to. Flying gives them too much power to do so.<br />
Much more so than stealth or avoiding mob paths. Hey, atleast both of those will make you notice the dangers around you.<br />
Getting some shitty &quot;OOPS YOU'RE TARGETED&quot; debuff and dismounted with a parachute while getting angry is hardly better, is it.</div></div><hr />

They've almost always restricted flying in content relevant to your level, so really this is no different than restricting flying whilst levelling up on Northrend or Pandaria. The only difference is that the levelling zones will continue to be relevant after the level cap. There's been no change in Blizzard's philosophy just how the game is being designed.<br />
<br />
Frankly I'm thrilled that the questing experience will continue past max level in WoD. At the moment I'm finding the level cap rather dull with not much to do aside from dailies which are only fun the first couple days.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I imagine that would be fantastic for you and your 3 friends, who would still be playing the game :P<br />
<br />
Not allowing to fly on WoD is just lazy design and total lack of imagination, there are 100s of ways they could create challenges while keeping the flying experience, first of all you have one more dimension to play with! It is a designers wet dream. This just shows to me that the guys left in charge of the design are either scared to try new design paradigms or lack imagination.</div></div><hr />
