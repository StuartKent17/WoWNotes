<br />
World of Warcraft – Gameplay and Systems Deep Dive<br />
<br />
Azerite<br />

Denizens of the islands will fight hard to protect Azerite<br />

<br />
Nodes and chests<br />
Creatures and Questgivers<br />
Powerful bosses and more<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions<br />
<br />
3-player Scenarios<br />
4 different difficulties: Normal, Heroic, Mythic and PVP<br />
Role agnostic (No need for specific role set ups)<br />
15-20 minutes to complete<br />
Low que times<br />
Goal: Obtain Azerite for faction and for yourself<br />
<br />
<br />
Dynamic Replayability<br />
<br />
Interactable environment<br />
Shrines that give unique buffs and debuffs<br />
Puzzles and optimal ways to play through scenarios<br />
Same island will look different and have different challenges every time you que up<br />
Locations of enemies, shrines and intractable items is random as is time of day and look of island<br />
Island Content that is randomly generated:<br />
<br />
Creatures<br />
Capture points<br />
Chests and Azerite Nodes<br />
Questgivers<br />
Consumables and Shrines<br />
Start Locations<br />
Caves, Ships...and more!<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Faction Champions<br />
<br />
The AI you face all have classes based on race<br />
<br />
Example: Troll AI - Shadow Hunter, Witch Doctor, Beserker<br />
Example: Worgen AI - Wolf pack that are really good at &quot;sniffing you out&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
AI Creatures<br />
<br />

Will go after map objectives that you are focusing on<br />
AI makes strategic decisions<br />

Example: &quot;Sneaky Pete&quot; Rogue could come and sap your healer while you are fighting a boss<br />
Unpredictable<br />
<br />
<br />
Different Island Locations<br />
<br />
Randomized islands mean random locations<br />
Take you to a wide variety of different visual locations<br />
Examples include:<br />
<br />
Abandoned Gilnean islands<br />
Un'gol Ruins<br />
Havenswood<br />
<br />
<br />
Heart of Azeroth<br />
<br />
The faction that wins will inherit a dying world<br />
Magni will grant players the Heart of Azeroth artifact, a neck piece gifted from our planet's titan.<br />
Heart is a new take on the artifact system without the linear path<br />
When the Heart gains Azerite it levels up and gains new abilities for three pieces of specified armor and itself.<br />
Gaining azerite will level up your Heart over time and unlock ranks that give the player an assortment of abilities to choose from on ever expanding tiers of rings.<br />
Every time you loot a new item, your Heart's power remains the same. You keep moving forward. It doesn't lose the azerite from the item being upgraded but may present you with different abilities from your previous choices.<br />
The strength of individual azerite abilities is determined by the item level of the piece of armor.<br />
Example: Character Shaman has a Heart of Azeroth power of 20, which unlocks 2 rings on the neck. The 3rd requires level 21. Said shaman can choose 1 ability from the first 2 ring tiers to empower, such as increased ghost wolf speed or more damage reduction on astral shift. When she unlocks the 3rd ring by gaining azerite, she gets to choose between several different abilities in that tier to empower. This tailors your character individually from everyone else. In this example, the shaman gets to chose between survivability or mobility.<br />
Choices will always be individual and new choices are made throughout the entire expansion.<br />

Me too, seems like we had more options before the character revamp. For some races all the faces look the same now. Would be great to see more options like height, weight (which probably won't happen because armor), more hairstyles and colors and better face customization sort of like Skyrim instead of only being able to choose from a handful of faces.<br />

Wait are we keeping our artifact weapons in the new expansion? Please tell me we aren't keeping those, I hated that whole system. I don't want to be an overpowered god-king anymore, leader of my faction. Just let us go back to being adventurers and finding our own weapons.</div></div><hr />

Pretty much. People are still hyped up, but after a day or two when all the excitement wears off, they'll realise just how weak the 'stuff' on offer really is. On /r/wow, the classic announcement video has 28k upvotes, with the BFA gameplay video at less than 5k.<br />

I'm sure they just haven't gotten to it yet, I mean obviously there are going to be big class changes. I'm hoping they will undo some of the damage they did to hunters.

I don't remember farming arrows. You could buy ammo from vendors and the best ammo was crafted by players which you could make yourself or buy on the auction house. You never had to farm them.</div></div><hr />

It does blow my mind that there were people around saying they'd release this on March/April. I disagree that it'll be a year long deal though.

Oh my. There is ton less in this upcoming xpac then in legion are you kidding me? There is barely anything new. Scenarios already in play, pvp is in play. Ok RTS version in game is new thats it. Lets see legion had<br />
<br />
Massive class changes<br />
Artifact system<br />
WQ system<br />
Order Halls<br />
Class specific storing telling lore and questlines<br />
Demon Hunter along with new class area<br />
Professions overhaul<br />
Wardrobe system<br />

Uncle To be fair, we don't know how this xpac ends. It can very well become an Old God xpac and the horde/alliance war just serves as a backdrop for the start of hte issues. Azshara is here. N Zoth is closeby.<br />
<br />
If this is the case, they need to fire the entire PR team.</div></div><hr />

Um, that's what I said? Not sure why you quoted me and responded in a way that you disagreed when you were just reiterating and reinforcing my point.</div></div><hr />

Isn't the new book a prologue to this expansion? The book releases in May so this expansion is probably a late July-August release.</div></div><hr />

This is, by far, the worst announcement ever. The story, the lore, the &quot;allied races&quot;, none of those things have ANY sens at all ! They already tried a Alliance Vs Horde focused expansion in Mop, and ti didn't work, because that idea of war between both factions has NO meaning, in mean, what's wrong with you guy's? You really think you can AGAIN make an expansion heavily PvP based, while ALMOST every Wow player dislike Pvp? Where Pvp and faction war has absolutly no-sense since Warcraft 3?<br />
<br />
Today, the Horde ONLY exist because the Alliance authorized it, because Varian did choose to let them a chance; and now, the new Horde leaders are doing EXACTLY THE SAME THING Garrosh did.<br />
Who the hell is writing the story? Christie Golden? How the hell will you deal with the second defeat of the Horde? (Yes, the Alliance will win, because the Alliance have always been more powerfull than the Horde, and i dislike the Alliance though), another &quot;I let you another chance, again, but be carefull !&quot; ?<br />
<br />
The ONLY expansion you could create, was and Old Gods expansion, not this stupid retarded shit you dared show us, do you really want your community hates you? Do you really want to kill your game by making stupid decisions again and again? Well you are on the right way, because i can guaranty you that expansion will be a massive failure; probably not enought to plain kill Wow but remember: NO ONE has forgot Wod, NO ONE has forgiven you Wod, don't try to screw you community a second time, because this time, there will not be another chance.<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth has the clear potential to replace and beat to the death Warlords of Draenor off the rank of worst expansion ever, and i am almost sure it will.<br />
<br />
1) Varian authorized nothing, he just didnt want to start a war after defeating Garrosh<br />
2) No faction is the strongest and no faction will ever really win, otherwise the game would be over. (look at the trailer)<br />
3) The worst expansion was Cataclysm :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems to be the B team expansion in the cycle. Cata -&gt; WOD -&gt; This<br />
<br />
It's borderline an embarrassment from a creative stand point. Blizzard is good when backed against a wall and has to bring out something compelling (like they did with Legion). When they get comfortable they do the more of the same thing crap. Actually this even feels like a step backward... <br />
<br />
The new zones look pretty.<br />
Islands are scenarios with random mobs on island maps (probably will be like 5 maps)<br />
Warfronts are BG's with resources you use.<br />
Allied races are re-skinned existing races. Horde I suppose kind of gets 2 new races (different animations, skeletons) and a modified current, while ally gets 3 modified races (this is all overall a positive addition though)<br />
<br />
That's pretty much it for &quot;new&quot; stuff right?<br />
<br />
I honestly don't really care about new quests, dungeons, raids. It all kind of feels the same.</div></div><hr />

I kinda get why it's hard to do in wow, but it's bittersweet. Mapping it for yourself, without being able to use the world map, so you actually learn where to go or just don't find it. Or get ferried by a friend. Would be so amazing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True, but if you have multiple ways to grind it, you will grow to despise it much later.</div></div><hr />

Artifact necks are just slightly tweaked artifact weapons without any of the cool weapon models. Subraces recolors of the normal races. Islands looks like the boring ass legion invasion 3 man scenarios with some randomness thrown in, meh. Feels like they put their B team on this and told them to just reskin the Legion systems and sent the good devs to work on a new game or something. Starting to wish Legion was just the last expansion and they went out with a bang and worked on a new MMO + Warcraft 4 or just WoW 2 with a new engine and what not. As is, if these are the type of reskin expansions we have to look forward to, WoW is going to die a slow and miserable death.<br />
<br />
They made the best cinematic trailer ever. That's about it. Probably rushed the work on that early this time for the hype because they knew they had nothing compelling to show of the actual gameplay..<br />
<br />
This !!!<br />
<br />
/agree ... 101%</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone who paid attention during any of this stuff will have seen that there are raids. When raids were presented you saw some ahn'qiraj kind of stuff, also later on there was an image of Queen Azshara, if you think the entire expansion will be Alliance vs Horde then you're not paying attention. It will start like that with probably some Old God stuff coming out later on while we are focused on the battle</div></div><hr />

It feels like the Legion invasions we invade which weren't quite as interesting as it first sounded. We already have dungeons - what is the purpose of this other than a grind?<br />
<br />
The one thing scenarios have going for them over dungeons and raids is that roles don't matter. You can usually 3 dps the scenarios, and as such you can use all of your tricks more often like binding shot for hunters. Where as if you had a tank, unless you're communicating well most won't drag mobs out of binding shot to get that sweet 5 sec stun, mostly because they don't notice it going down in the dense pack of mobs. So queue times should be super short like scenarios, I really loved them in MoP.... so far the only thing I'm kind of interested in this expansion.</div></div><hr />

It sounds to me like you're looking for a different genre of game. What more could they add at this point, mechanically? A version of PVP that works like a 2D fighting game? A dating simulator? I would say that's a joke, but we already have a built-in Pokemon clone, platforming puzzles, farming and base-building minigames, etc. How much more can they even add to this game?<br />
<br />
I mean, you spend a lot of time talking about how you don't care about anything in the game, but I don't see you typing out what features or content you want to see. What would even satisfy you at this point?<br />
<br />

<br />
and the fly? they will keep us grouded till patch 8.9.9 doing that fucking pathfinder again?<br />
Isn't it clear at this point that Blizzard and the majority of the playerbase is happy with the pathfinder system?<br />
<br />
You can complain until you're blue in the face but I don't think it's going to change.</div></div><hr />
