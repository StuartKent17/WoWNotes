Oceanic In Game/Server Lag Issues<br />
I just wanted to confirm that over the last few weeks, we’ve made a number of changes to potentially address reported lag issues with Oceanic realms. Those changes and updates to the game service are now implemented.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Can I get an official confirmation for if we delete the char that we earned our Heritage Armor, will we also lose the appearance? Or is it safe to delete those chars?<br />
Once you have earned the Heritage armor, it remains in your transmog library regardless of the fate of the character who earned it. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/1110307246263685121))<br />

Look at them. I mean...that was a rather obvious result. If they would have added a 5th answer:&quot;All of them are ugly.&quot;...guess which one would win then. ;-)</div></div><hr />

^ this. They sit wayyyy too high on the head. Crowns usually rest a little above the ears. This reminds me of a crown sitting on an egg at Easter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it's written 75 but the buff is actually 100. Don't know if it was hotfixed or not, I'm using the mythic crown to craft my gem btw, but I dont think it matters. I'm BE too<br />
<br />
On a side note, I still don't understand why MMO-C still uses a male human model, the worst of all models, to show stuff... 90% of the gear is ugly on a human male<br />
<br />
I've the 3 crowns (nm, heroic, mythic). I got the crown on the first kill on each difficulty... Too bad I wont get the lfr version because I just dont wanna get all their diseases and derpness</div></div><hr />

Thought it would be a good idea to have the BLACK and YELLOW combo in Raid finder? I thought it was pretty normal consensus that BLACK + YELLOW and BLACK + RED are some of the most badass looking combinations of colors? Like what the actual fuck.<br />

I think running on foot till 40 will, shall we say, &quot;disincentivize&quot; a great many people who try or think they want to play Classic, ESPECIALLY when they have to run on foot into the same densely packed area of mobs four times on quests. <br />

PS: I don't care about your mythical &quot;community&quot; and &quot;get help&quot; blah blah comments, it ain't gonna happen.<br />

Blah blah blah I'm a crybaby WoD baby. <br />

It's happening. Your crappy game is dying and ours will take over. <br />
<br />
You can quit whenever you feel like. Buttons are so hard to press for a manchild like you. You need mama and daddy hand holding your sorry butt while you live in their basement forever.<br />

The song's really good but the amount of people I've seen demanding Classic be used to bring the live game back anywhere past Wrath makes me associate it with frustration, sadly.<br />
<br />
Live game is crap. There's a reason it has been bleeding subs since Cata and only sees a few swells at expansion launch. It's mediocre. It caters to insta-gratification based children. It's a chore based game with no reward other than pixels. You'll forget about it 10 years. It's nearly 15 years later and people still want to play Classic. WoD, Legion, BfA, MoP all won't see that type of support ever. They satisfied people that don't even understand how their own brains work. They only understand &quot;gimme now or I'll quit&quot;.</div></div><hr />
