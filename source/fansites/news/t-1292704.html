Patch 5.3 PTR - Build 16896<br />
There was a very minor PTR patch this afternoon, it only had two significant changes, one of them being the addition of the Block Chat Channel Invites option. <br />
<br />
The other change was an increase in the amount of PvP Power Rating needed to get 1% PvP Power from 265 to 400.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Misc<br />
There are no easy fixes to low pop relams. We are working on some fixes, but too early to talk about them yet. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/325327940743221248))<br />
<br />
So what you're saying is that it's bad to bench people because you want to stack a class but fine when you want diversity?<br />
We don't want e.g. warlocks to never get brought to a raid. If you are encouraged to bring a mage b/c you have 3 locks, that's fine. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324580994361479168))<br />
And in most cases, you could bring 6 locks and still progress. You're less efficient, but not dramatically so. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324581193343434752))<br />
My overall advice to most players is to pay more attention to fun and less to efficiency. I predict you will enjoy the game more. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/324581341561769984))<br />
<br />
A lot of people still don't know about changes you guys make, any plans on in-game patch notes?<br />
If they don't read our website why would they read them in game? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322389462250291200))<br />
<br />
Do you guys have interns programming your tooltips or something? Seems that there are always a TON of &quot;tooltip bugs&quot;.<br />
There are just a lot of things that can change a spell's points and the game doesn't know them all innately. We have to fix 'em up. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321770790271987712))<br />
We've gotten spell tooltips much more accurate to the point where the inaccuracies jump out now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321770637335089152))<br />
If you look back over the history of WoW, the tooltips were stupidly inaccurate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321770496876232704))<br />
<br />
As an artist I can tell 100% that there are more than enough skilled artists with superior quality compared to something<br />
We would love to get more of their resumes. Many artists these days study photo manipulation, but can't always make a good sword. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321319667757101057))<br />
<br />
You can`t seriously be saying making more content is a problem of there not being enough skilled people in the WORLD to hire?<br />
We haven't interviewed everyone in the world yet. Hiring is a slow process and we are quite picky. We don't hire to fill a quota. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321319277946892288))<br />
<br />
(Curiosity): does Blizzard have a working definition of “casual”? If so, is it more about what you do, or how much you play?<br />
We don't really. Casual is too broad a word. We try to have content aimed at a wide variety of players. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320299860928651264))<br />
I just see a casual gamer as someone who is playing &quot;casually&quot;, means on occassion.<br />
There are also very experienced and skilled players who play only rarely. &quot;Casual&quot; doesn't really describe them. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320343094555967489))<br />
Likewise, we have players who play nearly every night, but only to RP and avoid raids or BGs. Not sure they are &quot;casual.&quot; (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320343241096581121))<br />
It's just one of those words that isn't precise enough to do the job. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320343310159970307))<br />
<br />
Questions about data mined patch notes make you crazy. Confirm or deny ?<br />
Confirm, especially repeated questions that I already addressed. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/323149274613436417))<br />

Hearthstone Gameplay - Paladin vs Warrior<br />
Another new match, this time between a Paladin and Warrior. You can talk about it in our Hearthstone forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/344-Hearthstone-Heroes-of-Warcraft-Online-Cardgame) or help out by adding the new cards to the Hearthstone wiki (http://hearthstone.gamepedia.com/Hearthstone_Wiki).<br />

Nah he's right, IT LOOKS boring. He didn't say &quot;I think it's boring&quot;... 2 different things. If you only want positive replies on everything, maybe you should move to North Korea, where everything is censored... Get over yourself man. You saying you LOVE the game (withouth having played it) is a weirder statement to make then him saying that &quot;it looks boring&quot;. But whatever right. The internet will persevere...</div></div><hr />

<br />
While I'm all psyched up about Hearthstone as you are, he is right that his opinion is as valid as ours. We think it looks nice, he thinks it looks boring. It would be a bad feedback, if he created a thread stating just &quot;Hearthstone is boring&quot; but this is a comment under a newspost for gods' sake... As long as he doesn't go &quot;FUFUFU, I'M GUNNA STOP PLAYING WOW CUZ HEALTHSTONE SUX&quot;, let him have his opinion...</div></div><hr />

It's a virtual trading card game so you'll be able to play it on your computer and at launch or soon after, it'll have support for the ipad and smartphones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What is your point? This game has hundreds of cards that we've killled or fought in game. What point are you trying to make? Deathwing is a legendary card that you can turn into, and we've killed him before. Totally confused as to what you are trying to say, rofl.</div></div><hr />

You already quoted me twice, telling some BS you've no idea about... this lets me seriously question your IQ.<br />
<br />
Saying that, Hearthstone looks boring is a valid opinion... do you run around and tell people who think that 22 people chasing a ball (football) LOOKS boring, that they should stfu cause their opinion is not valid?</div></div><hr />

True. But everyone who played WC3 killed Uther, didnt even take a raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it is not a valid opinion. It's very bland and you didn't say why you think it is boring. You haven't played it either so your opinion seems to be either trollish or just making assumptions that are baseless.</div></div><hr />
