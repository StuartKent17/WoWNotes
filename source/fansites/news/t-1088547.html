The sample size was ~5.7 million level 85 characters, with ~290k that have defeated the Heroic Morchok encounter. Keep in mind that the sample contains many alts, which makes the absolute numbers look lower than they are in reality. This means that we are looking at encounter difficulty relative to the easiest encounter, not the percent of the player population that completed each encounter. <br />

What Was Vanilla WoW Like?<br />
I was actually chatting just last night with someone who had started playing shortly after Cataclysm launched.<br />
<br />
I have lots of great memories of adventures that have spanned from when World of Warcraft first launched through to the present day. The game has evolved quite a bit over the years, and I’m especially thankful for the many quality of life upgrades that were made along the way. <br />
<br />
Way back when, you could only get a mount starting at level 40, so it took quite a bit of time to travel around Azeroth on foot. Flight points were by far the fastest modes of transportation, but you could only use them if you first hoofed your way over and discovered each Flight Master individually. When you used flight points you also could only travel directly from one to the next. They didn’t automatically connect to your final destination like they do now. So you’d have to make your way to the first point, talk to the flight master, fly to the next point, talk to the flight master, and so on. Accessing dungeons or raids also required additional travel time, as you had to make your way to them manually, and there were no mass summons or personal flying mounts back in that era that could speed up the process, either. So assembling five people for a dungeon run involved quite a bit of waiting around while people slowly made their way to the particular dungeon. It often took even longer for raids to get up and running because you’d be waiting for 40 people instead of just 25 or 10.<br />
<br />
Battlegrounds and Arenas (both of which I relish) also did not launch with the original game. The first two Battlegrounds areas, Alterac Valley and Warsong Gulch, went live on June 7th, 2005, and you had to physically travel out in the world to the particular Battleground portal for each location in order to queue for them. As there was no time or resource limit on those games, they could run very long, and indeed some Alterac Valley matches on the servers I played on at the time could span multiple hours or even, in some cases, multiple days. For Battlegrounds, specifically, there were no cross-realm Battlegroups originally, so you could only face-off against opponents from your individual realm that were on the opposite faction. Way back then, you also couldn’t step up and challenge another guild on your own faction to an all-out War Game in Warsong Gulch, either, because War Games didn’t even exist until shortly after Cataclysm launched.<br />
<br />
Travel around Azeroth and assembling groups for anything from PvP to dungeon runs and raiding is much more efficient now than it was in classic times. I think it’s especially fantastic being able to freely roam around the world and do other activities while you wait. Then, once the group is assembled, you can teleport directly into battle with your comrades as well as your friends from other realms (thanks to the advent of Real ID’s cross-realm support). And that’s, well… awesome.

Global Writing Contest<br />
Instead of the Global Writing Contest this year, would you all be interested in a poetry contest? <br />
<br />
If so, what kind of parameters would you like to see set on the contest entries? (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/218092-story-forum-lounge-17/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4079869335?page=6#109))<br />

Patch 4.3.3 64-bit Client<br />
If you are currently testing the 64-bit client, in order to patch up to 4.3.3 you will need to remove the 64-bit files to allow the patching process to complete. With the 64-bit client files in place you will receive the error: Blizzard Updater failed with an internal error.<br />
<br />
Simply delete the 64-bit files listed below from the World of Warcraft folder, and the patching process will resume after going through a short repair process.<br />
<br />
Windows<br />
Battle.net-64.dll<br />
MovieProxy.exe<br />
WoW-64.exe<br />
<br />
Mac<br />
World of Warcraft-64.app<br />
<br />
A new version of the 64-bit client files will be available for 4.3.3 after the patch is live. Please keep an eye on the 64-bit client forum thread for updated files.<br />

because its heroic<br />
<br />
heroic is supposed to be very hard<br />
<br />
its not like people dont see the content these days. if you're a competent raider, but just cant put the time needed into clearing heroic content, you can easily do normal mode. if youre terrible, go do LFR. you can afk through it all and they wont even notice</div></div><hr />

You know Blizzard, that was a part of the game. Blizzard took it from players and they started grinding. I bet some of the players doesn't know what the friend list is for. You can't find anybody outside of the city unless he is leveling. Nobody is looking at the world you created. Same for the groups. Gathering and managing 25 man group was a part of the gameplay which made it the feel epic. <br />

Well, I'm hoping that at some point they'll open the beta signups again. While I did get my signup in time (in the first few hours, actually) I saw many, many people who were late to seeing all the Guild Wars 2 videos from the media blitz last week and was won over to try to get into the beta long after the beta signups ended.<br />
<br />
Which really, this was probably what ArenaNet is attempting to do -- throttle it all down to build up really high demand for it. While I don't agree with the hype-building tactic, they at least release very frequent blog posts about their latest game design iterations with their intentions very clearly spelled out, by multiple persons working different aspects of the game (approaching like 2 a week now, for the last few weeks).</div></div><hr />

Yea I agree. It made all of those things seem horrible when in reality it was part of what made the game so great. Working to level 40 and farming the gold for a mount actually meant something. Having to run slow until that point was part of what made it such an achievement. Forming groups from people in the city or zones of your own server wasn't a bad thing at all either, that's how I met almost all of my friends in-game in classic/BC. I'm not sure where or when this mentality of &quot;easier/quicker = always better&quot; started but it's unfortunate.</div></div><hr />

I don't even know what to say to you... Maybe ill start with reminding you that blizzard doesn't give a fuck about what you write here, if you want to complain (like the millions upon millions do) you log on to the official forums. Do you want to know whats funny about people like you? Its that they keep on this facade made up on &quot;it was better in the good old days&quot;, &quot;gathering people wasn't hard, it was fun!&quot;. When you know damn well that if you got a chance to return to &quot;the old days&quot; you wouldn't last a day. Finally i would like to tell you that blizzard never stole it from you, they simply gave you a faster and more flexible alternative. Just because you can use it, doesn't that mean you have to use it. Like the buff in the Dragon Soul.<br />
<br />
PS. Don't state that nobody is looking at the world they created, its foolish to use that as an argument.</div></div><hr />

They have been swallowing their own kool-aid for awhile now. I started back in Vanilla, and while I'll admit nothing is quite as good as the 1st time you do it, what they completely fail to appreciate is that in Vanilla the game, for all its grindiness, provided a sense of accomplishment. <br />
<br />
Was getting constantly ganked in SVT fun? Not really but it was epic and when you got a bunch together and ran them off you made friends and felt triumphant and the world was alive. Was walking to 40 fun? Not really but you became knowledgable about the world and immersed in it. You also greatly appreciated that mount at 40 and I'll never forget getting my lock's mount. I could go on and on but you get the point.<br />
<br />
Many of the things they decry are the very things that brought players together and created a mechanism to bond over shared pain (grinds) and triumphs. There is simply nothing in the game today that compares and almost nothing that requires any real effort and/or provides a sense of accomplishment anymore. The Facebook gamer/ instant gratification crowd have won the day but lost the war though they just don't know it.</div></div><hr />

Do you want to know whats funny about people like you? Its that they keep on this facade made up on &quot;it was better in the good old days&quot;, &quot;gathering people wasn't hard, it was fun!&quot;. When you know damn well that if you got a chance to return to &quot;the old days&quot; you wouldn't last a day. Finally i would like to tell you that blizzard never stole it from you, they simply gave you a faster and more flexible alternative. Just because you can use it, doesn't that mean you have to use it. Like the buff in the Dragon Soul.<br />
<br />
PS. Don't state that nobody is looking at the world they created, its foolish to use that as an argument.<br />
<br />
<br />
Did you even play back then? The only reason the current system is tolerable is because of how laughably EASY dungeons and heroics are these days. I've been leveling a disc priest, and I literally heal through the whole thing but shield the tank and smiting mobs. I am normally #2 or 3 on dps. If dungeons were anywhere near as hard as they were back then, this system wouldnt be the same. I don't know how many times I've been frustrated because the dps are severely lacking in over all skill and damage, the healers aren't paying attention, or the tanks can't hold more than one mob(even though threat isnt a real issue anymore to people who even try). On my server, everyone knew everyone. We all knew who the baddies were. We all knew who the ninjas were, or the people who didn't know or care about tact or being polite. Nowadays in this &quot;better&quot; more efficient LFD/LFR system, you are more likely carrying way too many people along, and will often bee treated badly when asking them to contribute more. Seeing 6k dps in a raid is just plain unacceptable.<br />
<br />
This current system takes away all responsibility and consequence. Although its more convenient to just sit in a city, or farm or craft while in the queue, its much worse for many reason. I know more character names because they are hilarious trolls in trade than because of running with good people is just sad.</div></div><hr />

Yes, people will faceroll this stuff when they hit 90, but until then, more than what is shown above need to have an opportunity to complete it.<br />
<br />
Hence them rolling out incremental nerfs. Which increases to 10% tomorrow or today depending on your location.<br />
<br />
I'd much rather see this happen then what they did in firelands which was one week it was suddenly faceroll, you wen't from 1/7 to 6/7 with no real challenge or fun.<br />
<br />
<br />
Put it this way, on my realm, only 3 guilds had killed a heroic boss in pre-nerf firelands. My guild being the only guild with more than 1/7 since we had done 6/7.<br />
The week the nerfs hit we had 19 guilds at 6/7 hc. <br />
<br />
In Dragon Soul my guild had done 6/8 hc pre nerf and the second guild on the server had done 4/8 and it still took them a few weeks after the nerfs to get to 6/8.<br />
<br />
The incrimental nerfs are alot better idea than huge nerfs all around, Heroic is meant to be hard ;) no one misses out on a fight by not doing Heroic, Normal is there so that everyone gets to see the fights. They miss out on a few extra mechanics, none of which in dragon soul were all that special, it's not like raggy where you got an added phase to the fight. These small nerfs mean the guilds that have been working on these bosses get a small push to help them on bosses they are probably already close to killing. Instead of losing all their effort and being able to suddenly faceroll it. People jsut wan't that extra little bit of help to get that boss down not to take out all the challenge of it.</div></div><hr />

Yeah... easy... did you even hear the crying over how hard t11 was? Easy heroics? Did you even look at the graph above you? Why do you want everything to be unbeatable anyway? I see the fun when you can actually complete a task, but your logic states that we should wipe and wipe and wipe for all eternity because that is... fun? hehe i like were your getting here, have you ever stopped to think that maybe just maybe the players got better? If you want it to be hard then play on a bloody calculator then. Its your own damn fault that you got better and are now crying because you dont feel challenged anymore. Ego plays a big part here as well.<br />
<br />
Actually i do agree with this part, sitting in a trade for 1h looking for people was more fun, i usually ended up getting kicked for being afk and had to look for a new grp but that was all fun idd. &quot;This current system takes away all responsibility and consequence&quot;. What consequences? if you mean repair bill then i am chocked to hear that you consider that a consequence.

Everything wasn't handed to you, my god how awful. Now its all sunshine and bunnies.... screw it everyone pays the same amount right? Here you go, here's a 5% increasing buff every two weeks. Vanilla and BC were great because everything was a little more effort, WORLD PVP!?!!? I don't even know how many hours of battles were spent in southshore, but damn were they fun. How hard was it really to assemble dungeon groups... spam in trade then fly to said area and ride mount to said instance, nope lets make a game where people aren't moving IRL easier. Why make a game area where people can actually move around? Why have flight points? Why have mounts? Why not just have it so if someone wants to be one place and they are in another they can port instantly to said spot. You know why not make the homecoming stone that!! There is a reason in the quarter where you're expected to see growth they still lost customers, it's not leveling out it was simply a minor hill on the down side of the mountain for this game. MoP will be even more simplified and normalized. There was a huge difference between heroic LK and heroic DW. That's pretty obvious, they can't compare the encounters. Hell, there hasn't been one encounter in this expansion outside of H Rag that was on the same level of design or creativity of Wrath or BC. I wouldn't expect the game to ever return the glory it held until they do away with the difference in difficulties, the feel of beating a boss was enjoyable, not doing it with x-difficulty or x-achievement. Oh well, vanilla and bc were great, wrath was decent, now the game is a joke and has lost it's edge. That's my rant!! Expecting big things from GW2 :P</div></div><hr />

As it is, I love the convenience of the LFG/LFR function, the speed in which I can actually do something other than soloing. Having to pull your hair out for sometimes hours for a group to do a dungeon/raid/battleground and pray that it didn't fall through midway was not enjoyable. Sure, having a guild that was active could alleviate those problems, but I'm positive that there were/are/will be more people in a smaller guild that wouldn't have alleviated those problems, especially if your server/faction is low population.</div></div><hr />

Takes away all responsibility ey... ok you will have to explain to me what you mean by this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I will gladly tell you what I meant by that! But let me clarify some things. When I mention heroics I meant heroic 5 mans. They are easy. I don't know how many times I've queued and me and a friend end up carrying people.<br />
<br />
Looking for a group for 1 hour? For the most part I can't say i've experienced that. In classic, the hardest part for me was getting people to do Baron 45 runs. Most of the time after 15 minutes of &quot;LF2M 1 tank 1 dps for Strat Live side&quot; and I would have a group. 15 minutes you say? Thats probably shorter than non tank or healer queues nowadays! As far as raiding went, we had larger than 40 people, so we rarely had to look for more for raids.<br />
<br />
As far as consequence. Back in classic, you knew so many people from running dungeons. You would meet a good player, add them to your friends list. The baddies or ninjas you remembered, because they did just that, ninja, or were bad. So they were often excluded. Nowdays, you queue up, and you get 4 random people you don't know. Whats to stop those people from just barely dpsing, or ninjaing loot, or needing on everything in lfr so they can vendor it? NOTHING. In LFR's youc an put someone on follow and show up only to push those need buttons. This happened to me sunday morning. I lost a roll to an S priest that had 3k dps on a boss. Maybe from applying a dot or something. Thankfully he was kicked right after. But he could then REQUEUE AS SOON AS HE FELT LIKE. That means no consequences. He wasnt punished in the slightes. Its not against the ToS to do any of that. Back in Classic and TBC, acting like that was socially unacceptable, so you were known to be a baddie, and no one took you on raids or groups.</div></div><hr />

I literally just stood in Stormwind with my alt Priest, queued up for dungeons for a couple of days or more, and I'm already in Northrend.

<br />
This is what I mean. MMO's are supposed to be social aren't they? It took more time, but finding groups for group quests and dungeons was supposed to be the point right? You can level to 80 and not encounter even one &quot;group&quot; quest or elite mob now. i can't say that for cata quests though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nostalgic because I remember how enormous the world felt when I started playing WoW and that I could get lost just wandering about, by foot, into the Barrens, Dustwallow Marsh, 1K Needles, getting killed after 10 yards into Feralas, with the music turned up high and just feeling lost to the adventure. Buying my mount at 40 felt like such an accomplishment. I remember just after buying it I went with a random group to SM and that too felt like such an adventure as I had only seen parts of Wailing Caverns and RFC before. Sure, nostalgia is typically a way of forgetting the boring parts of the game, but I sure loved that feeling of having such an enormous world to explore and doing it by foot, or at least down on the ground let me see stuff I would never experience from my flying mount, moving at 351% speed (or what ever the 310% + guild speed gives you these days) as I move around from dig site to dig site.<br />
<br />
The cynical aspect; is decreased travel time and increased efficiency for the player all that Blizzard thinks has improved since Vanilla? Hell, I would take less efficiency and longer travel times any time over for example focus for my hunter instead of mana (silly example I know).</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Elliotwalls</div><div class="date">2012-02-28, 08:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Any heroic raider who has yet to get a full 100% kill of Dragonsoul Heroic has no right to complain about the additional buff. For those who have already gotten full heroic clears - good for you, you can use that as a badge of honor. Now step aside and let others have a slightly easier chance at killing those ridiculously hard bosses. You killed it first, if that's not good enough for you then you should probably see a psychiatrist. I am NOT kidding. You might have emotional problems that need serious attention.<br />
<br />
If you are complaining about the buff and have not yet killed Maddness... then, well, I have no words for you. You've had plenty of time to get your kill. I'm sorry, you didn't do it in time. You failed at 5%. Give it another go at 10%, see if it helps. If not, see above.<br />
<br />
LFR exists for multiple reasons, not just one. It helps people gear up and prepare for normal raids. It gives non-raiders a chance to experience raid content. It is NOT a stopping point. People LFR in the hope that they can one day do normal raids. Likewise, people do normals so that they can one day do heroics. Some people find a stopping point somewhere along the way, but not all.<br />
<br />
Personally, I'm looking forward to 10%. A little extra help will make raid nights go faster and smoother.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But the amount of annoyance i had with finding a group, sure u had a lfg channel but best thing to do was going to dalaran spam /2 and /4 at the same time that u looked for more player. After a nice 20 mins sometimes 40+ mins up to an hour (if u were saved for the majority of the dungeons), u had to fly all over to UP / UK or the Nexus and if ur lucky than someone flew with u.<br />
<br />
If not u have to beg people to fly so u can summon, or the 2nd flyer only had a 60% speed mount. Point is, nobody flew to the dungeon before the group was full as there was always a possibility that the group failed at getting 5 people so u had to go all the way back to dalaran or use ur HS unless it was on CD. <br />
<br />
Than u always have the type of people in ur 5-man that doesnt know how to look up if ur saved or not, same as it is with BH these days. <br />
<br />
Awesome times it was.<br />
<br />
LFG makes it easier and if Blizz goes back to form ur own group and fly over than WoW prolly lose more sub's over the time. Able to run dungeons non-stop without looking if ur saved or not. Sure waiting time for DPS might be the same ~15 mins, but the annoyance of flying over to summon or to find out that 1 of the 5 is saved is gone. It made place for the annoyance of easier ninja looting but that doesnt even bother me that much as u can just reque and might even end up in the same dungeon.<br />
<br />
Lvling wise, i just started to lvl my old druid who got stuck at 68 during WotLK (think it was 1.5 years ago and i hate lvling, read: questing) and did this through LFG tool skipped all of Northrend, only did a few quests in hyjal to get ilvl 272 to go dungeons again. Now im 83,5 less than 400 quests done, could have been far less if LFG existed back than. Questing through Deepholm once again for that stupid non BoA shoulder enchant.<br />
<br />
So yea LFG does make people go outside City's far less, they said they chance or try to chance it in MoP to make it more attracting to go outside for world bosses and this on a PvP realm makes it fun again.<br />
<br />
Seeing i hardly left the city's anyways, the game became better for my type of play.<br />
Faster Dungeons, faster raids (mass summon, mass ress) and LFR while lvling is more fun with these tools as well.</div></div><hr />

I know some runs that would take 3 hours or so and in the 10-15 man group there were probaby 20-30 unique players in it. Some things were a lot of fun like being able to do pvp with whatever spec you wanted, and knowing that people would for the most part TRY for objectives as you really got jack shit for losing.The grind to 40 for the mount was HELLISH youd get it and you wouldnt be like woohoo it was like OMFG that was painful as shit.

I agree with this. In TBC, my Paladin went Prot to try out the improved tanking skills. Many people were skeptical, but eventually trying really hard made it so logging on meant I was getting whispered to tank. All my toons had full friends lists, even a few notepads with other names after the fact.</div></div><hr />

But let me clarify some things. When I mention heroics I meant heroic 5 mans. They are easy. I don't know how many times I've queued and me and a friend end up carrying people.<br />
<br />
Looking for a group for 1 hour? For the most part I can't say i've experienced that. In classic, the hardest part for me was getting people to do Baron 45 runs. Most of the time after 15 minutes of &quot;LF2M 1 tank 1 dps for Strat Live side&quot; and I would have a group. 15 minutes you say? Thats probably shorter than non tank or healer queues nowadays! As far as raiding went, we had larger than 40 people, so we rarely had to look for more for raids.<br />
<br />
As far as consequence. Back in classic, you knew so many people from running dungeons. You would meet a good player, add them to your friends list. The baddies or ninjas you remembered, because they did just that, ninja, or were bad. So they were often excluded. Nowdays, you queue up, and you get 4 random people you don't know. Whats to stop those people from just barely dpsing, or ninjaing loot, or needing on everything in lfr so they can vendor it? NOTHING. In LFR's youc an put someone on follow and show up only to push those need buttons. This happened to me sunday morning. I lost a roll to an S priest that had 3k dps on a boss. Maybe from applying a dot or something. Thankfully he was kicked right after. But he could then REQUEUE AS SOON AS HE FELT LIKE. That means no consequences. He wasnt punished in the slightes. Its not against the ToS to do any of that. Back in Classic and TBC, acting like that was socially unacceptable, so you were known to be a baddie, and no one took you on raids or groups.<br />
I /clap to you my friend, i feel that now what ever i join to the conversation will just be output by the amount of correct arguments you have. I dont agree with all of them but the more impotent stuff i can relate too.</div></div><hr />

On another note, I wish that Blizzard poster had said a couple of positive things about Vanilla. He took a really heavy pro-Cataclysm slant and made it seem like it wasn't an enjoyable experience at all, while it certainly was for us. From a PR angle, it wouldn't make sense to hype up Vanilla too much though, so I can't blame him. Just a couple personal anecdotes would have sufficed instead of focusing on quality of life upgrades.</div></div><hr />

I wish the game could go back to those days! I miss it all even though I was a Shadow Priest back then and it sucked big time there was no better time then Classic WoW.AV lasting for days and days and WSG was so coooooool. :)WORLD PVP - No need to say more then those two words.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Oziriz</div><div class="date">2012-02-28, 09:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Vanilla WoW was a game that revolutionized the MMO marked. Because it did everything right back then. The gameplay was solid, the open world was massive and amazing to explore. Everything was based on playing together. Be it group quests, 5 man instanced, raid instances or PvP. Or just farming elite areas with friends, or summoning bosses in Silithus with your guild and friends.<br />
<br />
Arenanet has looked at this and thought, how can we re-introduce that camaraderie without forcing players to play with random people from some sort of queue system, or worse from other servers. Causing this weird, I'm here for myself and CBA with you all because Ill never see you again anyway attitude. Bringing the servers back together for the same goal. Without mob tagging, without forced grouping and gameplay that is heavily focused on action and playing together. Giving people a reason to go out in the world and play together, because it's only beneficial to do so and more FUN! A true MMO.<br />
<br />
And don't get me wrong, WoW still has good aspects. I mean raiding is amazing and PvP can be halla fun and competitive but the game is lacking reason to go out and adventure together, help other people out just because you happen to be there and make new friends on your server, because you want to be recognized on the server as a nice person so you get more stuff done. But WoW is much more a normal MP game where a massive amount of people just happen to stand in the same city queuing up for instanced stuff. It doesn't feel like a MMO anymore, despite bringing out solid raiding content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough and it is great that it was like that for you. Obviously if you manage to get a group in 15 mins back in the days, you would still have travel from Org to Strat. Fat chance your group would all be in UC or so.But that is not the point. Your experiences are NOT what everybody else experienced. You cannot generalize.<br />
<br />
Also: There are tools to punish undesired people ven Cross realm. You can ignore them. If these people are so terrible, they will eventually be ignored by more and more and more people. Just don't use that half assed argument that it will not work or isn't worth your time. <br />
<br />
In addition: Nothing stops you from:<br />
-still making your groups &quot;the old fashioned way&quot;. There are so many people whining here how awesome everything was back in the day, you'd think you still can form your groups in /2 in 15 mins.<br />
- pre-forming groups for LFRaid<br />
- skip LFraid because clearly you are too awesome for that.<br />
<br />
Don't tell em the entire community magically desintegrated including all your great people and great friends when LFD and LFR was introduced? Why would they? You had apparently and awesome friend list with awesome people in an awesome guild that made awesome progress. And along comes an automated tool and the guild falls apart? You seriously want me to believe that? All your close knit little community, guild, friends gave those great experiences up? For what? Apparently you got your groups faster than now, the atmosphere was better, the runs smoother? I dowubt you tell it as it was.<br />

Oh come on, seriously. The guy's post that you applaud? It is nothing but self pity? Everything was so great and you cry about the &quot;The Facebook gamer/ instant gratification crowd have won the day but lost the war though they just don't know it.&quot; I am sorry, but that is such a victim mentality. You had it all and magically lost it? How about getting your behind up and DO something in the game about it. Did Blizzard also corrupt all your great friends? No - but it is easier to whine on a forum than bite your teeth and do something.<br />

Have you nostalgia junkies forgotten that the only reasons that raiding anything aside from naxx40 was hard was that:-most raiders were new to mmos, hence terrible or people who got carried-most specs in the game were so broken that they were nigh unplayable in a raid setting or only brought for buffs, if you arent a warrior, you don't get to tank. If you aren't a priest, you don't get to heal. Paladin? Enjoy sitting in the back refreshing 5 minute blessings for the while raid!-gear itemization was complete garbage, ex: rogue gear had spirit, etc-keeping 40 competant and geared players constantly raiding was incredibly hard for all but the best guilds.Look at most of the vanilla raids. mechanics were a joke compared to today. Having to farm the buffs and consumables was a pain in the ass too since you stacked portions and elixirs. Raiding in vanilla was fun, yes. But it was by no means more &quot;difficult&quot;.</div></div><hr />

The game content, by that I dont mean just raid content, is getting smaller with each addon. There is no point in flying around the world except for herbs and ore, archeology is hardly worth mentioning. Its sad that players can remember the fun they had in classic or BC than in wotlk or cata. - Classic -&gt; Awesome - BC -&gt; Great - Wotlk -&gt; Good - Cata -&gt; Average - Mop -&gt; Think yourself. Imagine the game from today without lfg, lfr, arena, flightmasters, raids that can only be accessed with 25man because of the difficulty and no epics outside raids available.<br />
<br />
The important question would be, how many of the current players could still play that?<br />
I know I can't. I'm exactly in the target demographic for all the continuous changes they're pulling, I used to pour hours upon hours upon hours into the game I started when I was a student, and now I am busy with work, studying for work, housework, family. I have time for ~2 raids a week, and very little time on tof that, let's say another 2-4 hours.<br />
<br />
Yet, I can keep up with the game.<br />
From my perspective it is extremely nice to see how the game has changed, allowing those who used to power-play it in the past to keep playing it, instead of coercing me to quit.</div></div><hr />

keep up with what exactly? keeping up lost it's meaning man I'm sorry. it's in an illusion if you think there is anything to keep up with.<br />
<br />
Yes, BEFORE, you had to pass through all the stages of gear to get better gear, progression was useful, keeping up WAS NEEDED.<br />
<br />
Now, excuse me to say this, but in 2 or 3 days after hitting 85, you can be 385ilvl geared full pve. And no, no BS, I just did a priest and in 3 days i had my 4set bonus T13. <br />
what's to keep up with? heroic gear? give me a break.<br />
<br />
Everything is reseted, everything is MADE so that you can quit and come back in a couple days you're up to speed. There is nothing to be keeping up about. Not when you're professions are maxed, you have a flying mount, and have 1 character that can buy the enchants for all others.</div></div><hr />

In most cases those bad groups never get any better,they just wipe and wipe and wipe and blame it on the game instead of themselves cause they will never get any better because they never listen to advices of players that want to help.And those kind of people are the ones blizzard is nerfing ds for.</div></div><hr />

You seriously must have too much nostalgia blocking your vision, because the only reasons vanilla raids(minus naxx40) were even remotely hard were for example:-people sucked back then. Seriously. Most people were new to MMOs and didnt understand mechanics really well.-MOST specs were completely broken to the point of being nigh unplayable for raiding. If you weren't a warrior, you probably werent getting to tank. If you werent a priest, you werent healing. Oh, you like to play a paladin of any spec? I hope you like sitting in the back, refreshing blessings for the whole raid! Druid? FANTASTIC! You can innervate the REAL healers!-gathering and maintaining a solid raid group of 40 competant, geared people back then was almost impossible unless you were a really amazing guild. You almost always had at least 8-10 people who barely contributed to the raid.-farming consumables was a bitch. since potions had no limit per encounter, and you could stack elixirs, you needed to stack as many buffs as possible for raids, including buffs for the harder encounters, for instance, having to kill nef for the org buff before you went into naxx.Honestly, those are just a few reasons that you might THINK raiding was harder. It was harder to ORGANIZE, maybe, but the encounters? Pfft. Look at most of the bosses in the vanilla encounters. The mechanics are a joke, and the only reason they would have been difficult at all to learn is because addons like DBM werent developed until later on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't understand where all the sarcasm is coming from. But I will try to reply without being as angry as you. <br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but someone being put on an ignore list is not a punishment. They do not get hindered in the slightest. I can put them on ignore, not hear their crap, sure, but in the current system, they may get booted for just afking through boss fights, but they can immediately just requeue. I'm not sure if putting them on ignore means I will never be randomly grouping with them again. I've never heard that. But its still not a punishment.<br />
<br />
Sure, I could make my groups the old fashion way. But how likely are YOU to join a group thats spamming trade for it? Be honest. The closest luck I've had with this is Bnet friends or guildies. But they aren't always available. It seems like you only care about time. Sure riding to the summoning stones sucked. Sure it took a little more time. But I don't queue as a tank, the times are about the same. There are so many DPS out there, it can still take 40 minutes to get a group.<br />
<br />
Sadly a lot of my great friends quit with wrath, and even more with cata. Some transferred to be with RL friends.<br />
<br />
ANd your whole thought process behind the &quot; you get the same thing but faster&quot; with LFD is totally flawed. Did you read my posts? Are you playing right now? Yesterday I was in LFR and DW, and only the TOP 10 DPS were above 30k. SERIOUSLY? No, that is not the same. These people are help accountable. They will likely never see me again. So they slack and get carried, and need one ever piece of gear they can. If thats the experience you had in Classic, then you were on a ruthless server. I don't even hear about people ninjaing things in pugs very often on my server. But in LFR is rampant to leech on others and take what you can. But thats just okay with you.</div></div><hr />

Ignore doesn't work. Why? Because there are millions of players. So what if I add one to ignore? It won't make any difference because I'll never see that player again anyway. Unless player is on hundreds of thousands of ignore lists, he won't ever get into situation that he can't get into group because he's on someone's ignore list.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Players no longer have ties to other players. In old days players met other players while leveling, while doing instances, while helping each other. That's what made making groups possible. Even if player didn't have enough friends on friends list, by finding one player to do instance with it was possible to find more people because chances are that player had big friends list.<br />
<br />
And last time I tried to get group old fashioned way, I was trolled and laughed at on trade chat. Of course there were always such players, but they were tiny minority. Why majority behave like that these days? Because there is no consequences of doing so. All thanks to LFD.<br />
<br />
So it is impossible to do instances old way because of: lack of social connections in game, facerollable 10 minutes long instances (who'd want to spend time gathering group to faceroll instance in 10 mins?), huge amount of trolls discouraging people from even trying to communicate.</div></div><hr />

The game is 100x better today. I played classic, and yea it was alright, but I never got anything accomplished because I couldn't devote that much time to a video game.

Amazing. I honestly can't find any of this 'they hate the old version of their own game' that quite a few of you have mentioned. They simply said, 'this is how Classic was. Now there's a lot of stuff that has improved the quality of life for players in the game, and we think it's pretty neat'; how or why you're reading so deep into this is beyond me. If anything, it speaks volumes about the people who are pissed off over the game for whatever reason yet aren't mature enough to cut ties with it when that would be the best course of action and how they're willing to read into things that aren't even there just to validate their emotions.<br />
This current system takes away all responsibility and consequence. But the old system didn't encourage responsibility/consequence either. You didn't get any other special rewards for being a nice person in BC, and you don't now. You don't get free gifts for doing your job now, and you didn't then. The difference was that, instead of waiting ten minutes for a replacement for your raid like you do now (or seconds for your five-man groups), you spent inordinate amounts of time doing that exact same thing which often lead to the group dying anyways due to lack of action. The old content was a lot of things, but it definitely wasn't a system that gave out extra rewards for not being an idiot.<br />
But its still not a punishment.I don't see how ostracizing people does anything but drive the system back into one like BC, which forced people to either get shit down right from the get-go or spend the year or two playing catch up all the time. If you come across someone you don't want to deal with, you don't deal with them, exactly as you would do in real life.<br />
But thats just okay with you.Yes, because I can use a standard LFD/LFR feature and put them on my ignore list so I never deal with them again, just like BC/Classic word-of-mouth reputations. Plus, I understand that LFR is subject to a lot of random variable, like asshole players, so I don't get bent out of shape when I meet one because I know that will probably be the last time I deal with him or her, regardless if I employ the ignore feature or not. I understand not wanting to deal with idiots/assholes, but at this point in the game's life and all the quality of life features employed to make dealing with those people almost a non-issue, it's really not worth all the energy you're expending getting worked up over this.</div></div><hr />

Truth is, it was the lack of mounts and walking to dungeons and only being able to get groups from your realm that made the game have a community and therefore made the game so good. No one is in the world now and no one speaks, they just autogroup and go.Blizzard killed their own game and now try to tell us it's better now than it was. They must think we're stupid.Most people will disagree I'm sure but I would:Remove flying mountsRemove LFR, LFDReinstate attunements.:)</div></div><hr />

While my thoughts on the old times may seem a bit nostalgic, yours seems overly harsh and bitter. I've never said Cata was bad. I've enjoyed a lot of my time. But some of the things the changed in the name of &quot;player well being&quot; took away some things you obviously didn't experience.<br />
<br />
None of your &quot;fixes&quot; are fixes at all. Putting them on ignore or just pretending they aren't there is just delusional, and that whole &quot;ignorance is bliss&quot; thing is totally out of this world. No matter how many people I put on ignore, there will still be 10-20% of my raid afking or slacking and getting all the same benefit. The word of mouth and cross realm ignore list is not the same. being excluded and ostracized either kept them from constructive people or caused them to change altogether.<br />
<br />
Seriously? The choices are get it from the get go or spend 1-2 years getting it down? What about a few weeks? Saying the gap is either being perfect at everything, or spending a year just to get things right is just plain stupid.<br />
<br />
And yes, it did encourage you to work hard. Your peers are often your hardest and best form of constructive criticism. Thats why college professors will often use your fellow class mates to give criticism. Groups always falling apart after a failure or someone leaving is just ludicrous to say. If anything in a pug or LFR, one wipe and too large a portion will leave. I was in an LFR after finishing Ultraxion, and someone started the ship event early, causing a wipe and 7 people left as soon as they rezzed. Whoever did that wil not get punished in the slightest. But sure, a few people put him on ignore.... maybe. Earlier that week, we were in an alt run in 10 man DS, and wiped on the Ping Pong Warlord, and suddenly a healer had to go, resorting in a group split. But who gives a shit about those nine other people. They probably won't remember me after today at all. I sure don't remember his name. But I know some of the great players I knew from Classic.<br />
<br />
It really sounds to me like you were just plain jealous of the players that progressed in Classic because you didn't have time. I got a job and joined some after school sports while my Guild was in MC. Lets just say I didn't get to do much raiding after that. It sounds to me like you want the most amount of gear for the least amount of time. Why doesn't Blizz just give us a full set of tier gear for hitting 90 in MoP? Also, we can teleport anywhere. That would save so much time. That would make the gear/time ratio so much more efficient.</div></div><hr />

It really sounds to me like you are just mad at anyone who plays this game that you don't know personally. Maybe you are unfamiliar of how MMOs generate consumers, so I'll refresh your memory. See, the 'carrot on the stick' scheme is what works. The epics, purples, mounts, achievement, etc... Yes, they are going to make those kinds of items able to be obtained within a decent amount of time. In Vanilla, it took months if not a whole year to grind enough rep to get the rep gear. Their system was grind heavy which kept them from getting a mainstream subscriber base. That's why they changed it, see in the business world things don't get changed if they work. This system was not working.. They saw an opportunity to make their game more user friendly, therefore generate more consumers...which they completely succeeded in.<br />
<br />
Now understanding the business model might be hard, since you are hellbent on believing Vanilla WoW was the best game ever (psych). The simple truth of the matter is wow would've never become the MMO powerhouse that they are today without changing the way the game was back then. Go read the ToR forums and see how well everyone likes trying to find groups and shit without ques. That games sinking faster than the titanic, thats why their next patch is called 'the jesus patch'. haha <br />
<br />
I'm not trying to hate on you, mate... I'm just trying to tell you that the game was not great back then and maybe you remember it so fondly because you were a kid in high school at the time and it seemed larger than life, but that also may be having a biased opinion when you compare it what it is today.</div></div><hr />

Whats a decent amount of time? They made reps and epics easier to get, and the shift from max level to raiding in TBC. Rep items and dungeons ebing associated with factions made things so much easier. You could farm instance to get rep, JP, gold, epics etc. Instead of class specific tier itemss, they made tokens mainstreamed so more people would get loot. Raids started at 10 mans, so less cooperation was required. Heroics were difficult compared to now, but the end bosses dropped epics.<br />
<br />
In Wrath, dungeons and and heroics became more mainstreamed as a whole because of the LFD tool. The heroics were laughably easy. Rep tabards were introduced, to make rep even easier to get. I think they made 1-60 shorter to level, and introduced BOAS which further increased leveling speed.<br />
<br />
Cata comes out, and dungeons are still easy. At the end of Wrath they put Ilvl caps on LFD tool. But now you can easily bypass this by easy to aquire pvp gear. LFR comes out, making epics and end game even easier.<br />
<br />
When will this stop? <br />
<br />
In no way have I said cata is bad. i enjoyed many a thing about it. <br />
<br />

The great thing about this post is how true it is. Things like respect are more of a reward than a purple item is, for the fact that its something from th real world. All those things he mentioned are more real that our gear is here. If my bos said I did a good job, and asked what I would like as a reward, i think he would respond better to respect than to &quot;I CAN HAZ EPIKS?&quot; MMO's are MULTIPLAYER GAMES. SO being social in inferred. You can &quot;succeed&quot; in the current game without befriending a soul nowadays. In Classic, it required you to talk to people, ask for help, and network.</div></div><hr />

I had a job from 7 to 15h, 2 kids aged 5 and 8 when WoW came. Played 3 times a week for 3 hours and some during the weekend. Seen from MC to Naxx. <br />
You just have to make time as with any hobby. Instead of going to the gym I was playing the game (gym is way better for my health, but I decided to focus on my other hobby, playing WoW).<br />
<br />
You make time for things you like to do, or if you can't make time, you find other things you might like and make them into your hobby. Stuff that requires some time investment isn't for everyone. <br />
<br />
But yes Classic was a drag in many places, but the way it is now, it's boring. I have nothing to do, I got 9000 Valor collecting in my purse cause there's nothing for me to do with, I logg-in at raid nights and do the raid and then hang in a city for 15 minutes until I realize it's a waste of time. I got everything outside raids what anyone can get, I can't be arsed to level another character, cause it's super boring.

Are you really trying to imply that the class specific tier drops off bosses were in ANY WAY SHAPE OR FORM better for raiding than tokens? Here's a little trip down memory lane....you have a raid group that goes in every week...and every week the paladin tier gear drops...over and over again. Every paladin in the group has it so it's completely worthless... It ends up taking forever.. absolutely forever to gear out your entire raid so that you could progress more easily. Having tokens makes it so that multiple players can get geared from the same drop which is in every way much more efficient than any other system.<br />
<br />
Also...a decent amount of time? In comparison to what, vanilla? Anything shorter I suppose. Grinding for months on end, every single day for one piece of epic rep gear is way too long. I would say a decent amount of time to be able to grind rep gear would be the Molten Front oR* Argent tournament, in example.<br />

Why do you have to be so self-righteous about your opinions? I played vanilla and got through most of its content. It was okay at the time, but honestly, if id had a game more like current wow is now around that time, id have switched to that in a heartbeat. So am I less of a &quot;true mmo lover&quot; because i dont feel like spending day after day after day grinding for a single item? Im sure a lot of us &quot;fake mmo lovers&quot; probably have a hell of a lot more experience playing mmos than you do.</div></div><hr />

I understand you completely, and I'm not trying to imply everyone hated vanilla wow..of course that would be completely wrong. What I am trying to say is vanilla wow's model was no where near the sub generator that BC and Wrath created and elevated to Cata.<br />
<br />
I understand why people think grinding is a bad system. But let me support it, I'm someone who LOVES grinding. Back in wotlk, when titles were announced via achievements. I made it my goal in life to get the Guardian of Cenarius title for my druid. The Cenarion Circle rep grind was brutal. But the time invested made the award so much better. The days of time I put in farming those scrolls, getting those 3 piece robes and handing them in for rep was so fun. Each day my rep bar went up just a little bit after my hour or 2, sometimes more investment of time. Once I had that last bar filled, it was amazing. The feel of accomplishment was well worth the time invested. I think grinds add a nice little time extender to the life of the game for those that really like the challenge and reward.<br />
<br />
Grinding isn't for everyone, thats obvious, but for those who like it, at least have that option. If you want something that is rewarded by grinding, but dont want to grind. That is your problem. The enjoyment of others shouldn't be sacrificed for you're special privileged self.</div></div><hr />

Having tokens makes it so that multiple players can get geared from the same drop which is in every way much more efficient than any other system.<br />
<br />
Also...a decent amount of time? In comparison to what, vanilla? Anything shorter I suppose. Grinding for months on end, every single day for one piece of epic rep gear is way too long. I would say a decent amount of time to be able to grind rep gear would be the Molten Front oR* Argent tournament, in example.<br />
<br />
You must really not have a great argument against my main point if you single out one, little, vague thing I said and twist it into that. No where did I said tier tokens was a bad thing. I was just trying to convey how, after each expansion blizzard has gone to great lengths to make things quicker and less harsh on players. STILL NOT SAYING ITS A BAD THING. But what I am saying is a bad thing, is all the things they lost a long the way. I had fun in every expansion for different reasons. I have no huge qualms with Blizzard or WoW.<br />
<br />
What you seem to forget is how things currently are. Have they really taken a grind out of the game? No, not at all. There are still things you have to do every day to stay competitive. JC dailies, 25 daily quests, going back to grind ALL THE REPUTATIONS, to get exalted for head and shoulder enchants. Now you can level to 85 fast enough to completely bypass multiple faction reputations. Then you can look at what &quot;raiding&quot; is at its basis, a grind. Once a week you do BH, LFR DS, and then pug or guild run Normal/Heroic DS. How doesn't that fall under a grind? I go there every week in hopes of loot, possibly not getting any loot at all.<br />
<br />
And on to tier tokens. Yes, they are a little bit more convenient. Buts its part of the system as a whole. Expecting loot every single time you kill a boss makes you a child. Thats it. What happens in lfr, is your tier group drops and 9 other people roll on it, often ones who don't even need it. So don't pretend like its just so much easier now. And why would you want it to be any easier than it is now? DO you want to hit 90 in MoP and receive a full set of epics just because you are a very special, unique little guy who deserves things without time invested? My point with that last post, is how far are they willing to go to make gamers' &quot;quality of life&quot; easier? If the system is SOOOO much better why are they losing subs?</div></div><hr />

Why would they? You had apparently and awesome friend list with awesome people in an awesome guild that made awesome progress. And along comes an automated tool and the guild falls apart? You seriously want me to believe that? All your close knit little community, guild, friends gave those great experiences up? For what? Apparently you got your groups faster than now, the atmosphere was better, the runs smoother? I dowubt you tell it as it was.<br />
<br />
Could you tell me the major difference between Massive Multiplayer and Console Arcade / Adventure Game definition? <br />
And then what is the Wow gameplay looks like now and where it is heading to? <br />
<br />
For mists of pokemonamania fans:<br />
Why it is okay to leave group after second boss in &quot;looking for free loot(raid)&quot; just because your deserved gear didn't drop?<br />
<br />
I can agree that Cata brings some good things in the game, but some of them could be implemented much better. They are giving &quot;tools&quot; to players which insanely speeds up their progression, and then surprised that patch is already became boring too fast. But new patch is not even properly designed yet or just started. <br />
<br />
PS: Please don't refer to Herioc raids in your reply. Herioc difficulty recently became very good excuse for making mistakes in the overall game design.<br />
PPS: Peace.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, two teams rushing past each other to quickly finish off the AI controlled boss is much more fun, clearly.</div></div><hr />
