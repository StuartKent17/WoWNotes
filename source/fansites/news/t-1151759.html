Mists of Pandaria Box Art<br />
Someone over on Reddit (http://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/vh3vo/and_so_it_begins_the_mists_of_pandaria_dissipate/) posted an image that looks like it could be the Mists of Pandaria box! As expected, it mentions that you need the Wrath of the Lich King and Cataclysm expansions to play. The Burning Crusade is not mentioned because it is free for anyone who owns WoW as of last year (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/183116-world-of-warcraft-and-the-burning-crusade-%E2%80%93-together-at-last/).<br />
<br />

Dual core CPU, up from a single core at 1.4 Ghz. It looks like it may mention a Intel Pentium D rather than Intel Pentium 4.<br />
2GB RAM (or 1GB for Windows XP), up from 1GB RAM.<br />
The X1800 Pro (2005) is now the minimum required GPU, up from the 9500 (2002), which may no longer be supported. <br />
The GeForce FX 5000 series (2003) also has been dropped from the minimum requirements, replaced by the 6800 (2004).<br />
The minimum hard drive space is still 25GB.<br />
The minimum resolution is 1024x768.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recommended Specifications<br />
<br />
4GB RAM, up from 2GB.<br />
64bit Windows 7, up from 64bit Windows Vista/7.<br />

South Korean players who were unhappy with the stability problems during the Diablo III launch will be able to apply for a refund! This was prompted in part by the Korea Fair Trade Commission investigation into denied refunds, which resulted in a raid on their office (http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/biz/2012/05/123_111971.html). South Korean Law allows a customer to receive a refund within seven days of purchasing something if the problems with the product are not caused by the consumer. <br />
<br />
The number of Korean players connected peaked at 430,000, which prompted the installation of more server capacity. The peak for all of Asia was 640,000.<br />
<br />
A player must have not played past level 40 in order to obtain a refund, which will be given out from June 25th to July 3rd. If you purchase the game from now on and want a refund, you will be able to get it as long as you have not played past level 20 and are within 14 days of the purchase date.<br />
<br />
Players who do not apply for a refund will get a free month of Starcraft 2 access, which can be gifted to a friend if the player already has a copy. <br />
<br />

it`s been happening weeks and weeks later, not just the week later.<br />
<br />
<br />
A teal color would've suited that box so much better... the red was already used for the Cataclysm box:<br />
<br />
maroon is a shade of red, it`s not so much red itself, just like the cata box is more orange.<br />
<br />
but i agree, jade or cyan or teal, fit much better.</div></div><hr />

You can just write to Blizzard and ask for one. They're generally pretty lenient, at least if you don't wait 1-2 months and 200 hours of gameplay after your purchase before asking. Many people in the US and EU got a refund no problem in the first week.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, the Heroclix community (a miniature game featuring Superheroes) gets really whiny as well. They can give the WoW community a pretty good run for their money, most of the time. *sigh* I would have to join two of the brattiest communities on the internet, wouldn't I?</div></div><hr />

No idea, but I didn't load the beta on my computer, or rather I did, but I haven't tried to play yet, as I was waiting for more to be ready. I dislike the super-buggyness that is beta release. I was waiting for it to be around the time now to try it out. I like testing instances and raids and such. But now I won't even bother, as my PC is too old to even dream of running MoP.</div></div><hr />

My situation with my computer isn't as bad as yours, thankfully (and my sympathies to you). It looks I'll still be able to play MoP when it's released, but I have almost all the settings on low already and it struggles somewhat in LFR -- on live. If I want to have an ok playing experience, I will need to upgrade at least a couple hardware/software stuff beforehand. (And I was intending on just replacing the entire computer somewhere down the road.)</div></div><hr />

I could tell you that you should do something rather unpleasant to yourself, but I do not wish to get into trouble with the mods, however, you have to realize, even with a blivet-brain like yours, that some people just can't knock out cash whenever they feel like it. <br />

The way he said that may be bad but he has a point. WoW system requirements are low. Very low. Even those mentioned for MoP. I understand that some people cant afford to buy a new PC but nobody is asking to buy a state of art machine. If someone can afford to pay monthly sub for WoW then he should surely afford to buy cheap PC parts that would meet the MoP requirements. And by cheap I mean really cheap. Second hand market etc. Unless someone can barely make it to pay that monthly WoW sub and there is no room for anything else. But in such case I would think that this person should consider if playing WoW is a reasonable thing to do at all. <br />
<br />
I know some people can be in tough life situations. But world moves on. By that logic someone could demand that WoW should be playable on hardware from 1995. Blizzard is already holding back becouse of people with weaker systems. If you would ask me, I would be for making a total engine overhaul that would probably boost the requirements x2. Some of WoW models from 2004 look goddamn awful today and lots of people will agree with that. And Blizzard is not upgrading only becouse that would piss people with lower machine settings. <br />
<br />
And yet I now read that some people say that MoP requirements are too high? Seriously? Lets try to be reasonable. Some compromise maybe? Since 2004 I bought a new PC three times already and next year I will probably buy fourth. That is perhaps over the top and I understand that. But if someone cant afford now to buy PC parts from 2005 he should reconsider if gaming is a good hobby for him.</div></div><hr />

I am not saying they are too high, far from it in fact. I just feel that they could have gone the EQ route and had their lower end settings for people that have crappy PCs, and have a greater field of upgradeable options, such as models, texture, etc.<br />
<br />
They don't HAVE to force the higher settings, they are choosing to.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Not complaining that they are too high, just that they moved me out of being able to play.</div></div><hr />

1. My butt is none of your business.<br />
2. I'm running a Core i5-3570K<br />
3. I'm critisizing that the recommended specs aren't useful to people who don't have a clue about hardware. They'd buy an old C2D rig and would just have to see that it's not enough to have fun in LFR/25man Raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Shouldn't the recommended setting tell you &quot;with this system you can do everything in the game w/o problems&quot;?<br />
<br />
And I doubt that it's that few that do LFR (which is 25man).</div></div><hr />

They're going to see a substantial subs drop if the recommended ends up real. I only actually know 1 person with a computer that meets those specs. Quite literally only 1. (at least offline). Everyone I know has a computer from 2007-2009, which don't fit those specs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But, since it seems you were in fact the one that failed to read, let me c/p it for you:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn't take a genius to see that this statement definitely implies/gives the suggestion that SC2 is on a monthly subscription model in South Korea.<br />
<br />
<br />
You sir are a genius that I dont even...<br />
Yes, we have a monthly &quot;plan&quot; which is 1/10 of the &quot;recommended&quot; price for 30 days, just like most other games. When SC2 just released, we even have a one day plan which sell for just 1/40 of the store price, just like other new games on shelf.<br />
But that doesn't imply our SC2 is on a monthly subscription model. Buying the game off the shelf in a store is way cheaper with more stuff and a lifetime pass.<br />
What you see is just a trial with a price tag.<br />
(Oh and NEVER buy Blizzard games via battlenet digital download, it is a rip-off. If you know your local gamestore well, you can get the same game alot cheaper with the box)<br />
<br />
Let me give you another example, MMORPGs here can be played without monthly or year pass. We can charge our account with pre-paid game time (eg:30 hours of game time for the price of 1/2 of monthly subscription).<br />
But that doesnt mean our WoW is based on a time-based subscription model, because we can have a monthly subscription and pre-paid game time at the same time. <br />
If our monthly subscription run out, we can still continue the game with pre-paid game time. If we beat the game and decide to turn causal, we can ditch the year pass and choose to be charged per minute.<br />
<br />
You can even go to your battle.net account, choose &quot;buy digital games&quot;, change region to &quot;Korea&quot; or &quot;Taiwan&quot; and see how your game in Asia works, its still in English.<br />
<br />
TL; DR, It is just a lame name to charge you $$ for a trial product.</div></div><hr />

Maybe your friends need to learn to shop more carefully then, I bought my current PC at the very start of 2009 and it was extremely cheap, every component was totally entry level or thereabouts and it still does 25 mans totally fine. The only upgrade I've had is a graphics card that you can now buy on ebay for easily under $50 (HD 5770).<br />
<br />

The MINIMUM, not even recommended, will require a multi-core processor. Please read before you comment to at least sound semi-intelligent.<br />
<br />
I have a single core. Guess I'm farked, huh?<br />
<br />
Too bad to me that I've been playing since April of 2006, I just get left behind.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Larwood</div><div class="date">2012-06-25, 01:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's compare to skyrim, which was released last year.<br />
<br />
minimum requirements:<br />
<br />
Windows 7/Vista/XP PC (32 or 64 bit) - roughly the same<br />
Processor: Dual Core 2.0GHz or equivalent processor - roughly the same, maybe slightly higher than MoP's given you can get dual cores will less than 2ghz<br />
2GB System RAM - the same<br />
6GB free HDD Space - lower requirement, but not really an issue <br />
Direct X 9.0c compliant video card with 512 MB of RAM - a higher requirement, given both of MoP's required cards commonly had 256 MB<br />
DirectX compatible sound card - presumably the same<br />
Internet access for Steam activation - the same/irrelevant<br />
<br />
And the recommended requirements:<br />
<br />
Windows 7/Vista/XP PC (32 or 64 bit) - perhaps slightly lower, but XP is over a decade old now it's time to move on<br />
Processor: Quad-core Intel or AMD CPU - a much higher recommendation<br />
4GB System RAM - the same<br />
6GB free HDD space - see above<br />
DirectX 9.0c compatible NVIDIA or AMD ATI video card with 1GB of RAM (Nvidia GeForce GTX 260 or higher; ATI Radeon 4890 or higher). - again, a much higher recommendation<br />
<br />
<br />
increasing the system requirements to these of the newer games?<br />
And that's comparing to one of the lowest requirements games. Compare to your average 'newer game' like your battlefield 3s and your modern warfare 3s, WoW's requirements are absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
Fun observation, Mists has similar requirements to Crysis, a game released 5 years ago. Women have fallen in love, married, become pregnant, given birth, and raised children who can walk and talk in the lag time between 'newer games' requirements and WoW's requirements.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, the minimum requires a dual core processor. Multi core refers to more than 2 in general parlance. $300 video cards and multicore processors, which you complained about, aren't in the minimum OR the recommended (hence I skipped to simply saying &quot;aren't even in the recommended specs&quot;). Please try consider if you have your own facts straight before attempting to insult the intelligence of others.<br />
<br />
But hey, let me try to fix your problem for you. A single core processor bought in mid 2006 was likely using a LGA775 socket* so let's have a look...<br />
http://www.ebay.com/itm/Intel-E2160-1-8G-SLA3H-SLA9Z-SLA8Z-SLASX-LGA-775-cpu-/120578007396?pt=CPUs&amp;hash=item1c13026164<br />
<br />
See, that wasn't too hard. Just stop paying for wow for a few months and you'll be able to afford that easily. Not that it would really be worth it, you'd be better off getting a whole new system probably (better chips on newer sockets are cheaper than that).<br />
<br />
*feel free to correct me on what socket you have</div></div><hr />

<br />
All I can do I suppose is get MoP and have everything turned down low and it should be playable. Because the more I think about it Blizzard's just saying Dual Core so they don't get flooded with complaints about people with CPU's older then 2010 whining why it doesn't run smooth.

Funny enough, I did buy mine in 2009. My brother assembled it for me once he had all the parts, and I did it on a budget of a little under $600. And the thing worked fine in WotLK with settings on &quot;medium&quot;-ish?<br />

WoW wants basically only one thing: CPU horsepower. That means; Yeah most folks out there running a LGA 7xx are screwed if they want to do 25man w/o massive FPS lag fest.<br />
<br />
My Rig was: C2D E6600; 4Gigs RAM (Wayne WoW only uses 1.3 or so); 8800GTX (Was twiddling it's circuits with 10% GPU usage in Raids).<br />
My average FPS in Dragonsoul was.. 10. Yup.. 5 or less in AOE heavy situations (WITHOUT parsing Addons like recount). (Playing on ultra (-Shadows) because graphic settings didn't matter. Fun thing huh?)<br />
That's why I call these &quot;recommendations&quot; BS.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well guess that means my system from 2010 with a AMD 64 bit CPU might be farked then for playing MoP even though it's played wrath and cata absolutely fine.

<br />
I raided till May 2012 with the basic &quot;blob&quot; shadows under my characters feet, because my 8800GTX didn't like the new ones at all. Check your options. Chances are that your CPU will run MoP just fine, test it in Beta.</div></div><hr />

To the guy with the 7 year old laptop: 7 years is LONG, it's OLD. The average life time of a PC is about 6 years, that's when they start to become old and &quot;need&quot; to be replaced to do &quot;current time&quot; things. I'm sorry to say, but your laptop has expired. And plus, most laptops are much weaker than PCs, and you probably do not have a high end laptop (more probably a medium range laptop). So with a medium range, 7 year old laptop.... yeah,.... don't complain about not meeting minimum requirements.<br />

Really? I paid 1.7k for mine in 2010 and I can play two copies of WoW -- one on ultra and the other on medium with no problems. I might even be able to play an additional game (Bad Company 2, for instance) with lowered settings.</div></div><hr />

My current rig is, 2.8ghz Pentium 4, 2gb of RAM and an X1650pro. I get around 15 fps in LFR (and not everything is on &quot;low&quot; either, most settings are good, except maybe shadows and particle and turned off sound effects.) Learn to tweak your settings a little and it runs ok. I'm hoping to get a new laptop soon, before MoP, but even so, I'm actually confident I could quest and run dungeons on my current system, maybe even run 10 mans.</div></div><hr />
