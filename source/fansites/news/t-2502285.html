You're 100% right.<br />

Please show your work.Servers will most likely run on the same hardware as Retail. That means they can accommodate 7-10K players online at the same time. Maybe even more because Classic is less demanding.<br />
<br />
With a generous estimate of 50K simultaneously players, and at the very very most 250K total accounts with one or more toons created, only 5-7 servers would be needed.<br />
<br />
Having 5x the needed amount of servers is sheer folly.</div></div><hr />

Yeh 10 servers on live probably easily hold more than half of the US playerbase (Illidan, Tichondrius, Kel'thuzad, Wyrmrest Accord, etc). The only reason other servers exist is because Blizzard is just too afraid of removing them due to being able to trap new players on dead servers and get 25 dollars+ to transfer them to a playable server.</div></div><hr />

Back when Official classic servers were just a dream. <br />
It was speculated that a lot people would not pay for it and keep going to their Free private servers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Private servers are okay. But the control the admins have is too much. I personally would rather pay and know I won't be banned just because someone doesn't like me. Which happens, and I've seen happen on some other Private servers. EQ and WoW respectively.</div></div><hr />

How many of those are level 120 characters? That 100k lowest pop server turns to 8k, the high pop 500k server turns to 44k. And how many are 120 alts. The numbers shrinks further. How many have logged in recently? Lots of metrics to keep shrinking the active player base. <br />

You do realize realmpop only counts total Characters, So most legacy players will have any where from 10-15 characters per server which drastically cuts down the amount of Population per server. So where Lightbringer says it has 202,000 Characters on the Alliance, that means in reality it is around 13000-20000 actual players. Characters does not = Accounts. It is a ridiculous argument to believe that the lowest server has a 100k players.</div></div><hr />

Folks just don't get it. I played on EQ private servers a bit, and know of a couple of folks who were removed from their guild, then later banned because they won an item fairly via the guilds DKP system. Blizzard will obviously do a much better job with Classic, and most of the private servers will die off.<br />

1. That's potentially the total number of characters CREATED, logged by a 3rd party statistic tracker that isn't able to track name changes (the only unique identifier for these things). These numbers have nothing to do with currently active accounts. The fact you even bring up this number as having any relevance of activity is just foolish.<br />
<br />
2. Realms are merely separate world environments, they're not tied to physical machines like they were back in 2004. That is, 24 realms are not 24 servers. Plus, it's idiotic to try to tie the number of realms at launch to population limits imposed on a far more demanding game (live). It's even further idiotic to assume that if demand is higher than the AT LAUNCH environments can handle (whether technically or gameplay-wise), they couldn't just easily spin up new realms in mere minutes...<br />
<br />
So, instead of being a toxic mess of a person that is only making the live community look even less appealing to be part of, perhaps just let people enjoy what they enjoy and stop using statistics and tech claims that you don't even understand?</div></div><hr />

Thats still fine, but when you have 513 servers across the world, and your LOW END ones have 15k active players, that is still really really good. Sorry to burst your bubble.<br />

Simpleton. OF course there aren't 100k active, and if you viewed the sliders on the website at all, you could see the disparity even further. But instead, you try to insult someone without ever actually doing any reading or inquiry yourself. Typical.<br />
<br />
No one is saying that dead servers have 100k ACTIVE, but they have 100k+ UNIQUE characters made on those realms. With the website showing roughly 3.9+ million, ACTIVE 120 characters. Sure, some of those are the same account, same person with alts, easy conclusion to draw. <br />
<br />
The point was, with only 24 classic realms, it will never take over retail, as all of those classic fanboys have talked about for the past year on this forum. Suck it nerd.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure they plan to emulate 1.12 server capacity, because recreating an authentic in-game economy depends on it. Server capacity at the time was 3.5k players.<br />
<br />
Now, some things to consider:<br />
<br />
<br />
Layering is being used to handle capacity overflow during the launch window, eliminating the need to open additional servers which could lead to potential server merges down the line.<br />
Server capacity will actually be somewhat flexible in order to accomodate the highest population realms after layering is disabled, as it's likely some realms will remain over capacity even after the launch window.<br />
Blizzard intends to provide a mixture of high, medium, and low population servers to accommodate player preferences, which means that they don't expect all realms to reach capacity in the long term.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't think we really have enough information at this point to accurately judge what the long term server populations are going to be, but you can certainly make some generalizations and estimations based on this information.<br />
<br />
<br />
So, for example, if you're being extremely generous and assuming they'll operate at triple 1.12 capacity and that every single server will be high population, you would have in the neighborhood of 250k players (NA+EU). Now obviously that's well beyond what will actually happen, because they won't operate over capacity in the long term and there will be a mix of high, medium, and low population servers.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you assume the servers will be operating at around 1.12 capacity (say 3.5k flexing to 5k), and you expect about a third of the servers to be high population, a third to be medium population, and a third to be low population, you're probably more realistically looking at 60-75k players (NA+EU).<br />
<br />
Assume also that Asia will have roughly the same population as NA+EU combined, which has historically been the case for WoW.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you're being overly generous, you're looking at about 500,000 players worldwide. If you're being more realistic, you're looking at about 150,000 players worldwide. Split the difference and you're looking at 325,000 players worldwide.<br />
<br />
<br />
Regardless of how you slice it, Blizzard obviously estimates far fewer than a million players, let alone ten million as some people have suggested on these forums. Just to hit 500k on these 25 servers, you'd need each and every one to be at 40,000 players, which is far, far over capacity.</div></div><hr />

Well, it is this (maybe any) forum in a nutshell. Already there are threads telling people how there are too few servers, because obviously..I dunno...these people collected better data than Blizzard at the stress test? Sure...I guess when you live in the mindset where Classic will have 10 million players, it appears for that we now get too few.<br />

Here is a reply in the thread that helped the OP: <br />
<br />
&quot;Hi Dottie<br />
Thank you for the help , checked my firewall settings and for some reason it had a block on the battle net application. After unblocking I restarted my computer and have found the new little drop down stating version. You my super hero and I owe you a cupcake .<br />
Thanks again man &lt;3&quot;</div></div><hr />

Blizzard, just like us, has no way of knowing how many people are actually going to play classic. It's not like you can preorder the game or something. Name reservations will help though.<br />
<br />
But they can likely easily create new realms in a few minutes with todays virtualization tech, should it be needed. Most likely they have them prepared anyway.<br />
Better to start with just a few servers, than having a bunch of empty ones.</div></div><hr />

They have an idea on how many people that are interested from different metrics, beta tests, general interest, downloads of classic so far etc. It's just that if classic would compete with retail, how silly that might be, they would have made 200 servers, just to take a fair amount, and this is far from that. To think that they don't have some kind of numbers on this doesn't sound logical to me, they do know a lot more than me and you.<br />
<br />
That they will get additional info from the name reservations, that's for sure, and will probably be one of the factor if they change how many servers they'll launch with.</div></div><hr />

The lowest pop server is 100k people. That is a massive amount of players. While the highest pop servers are 500-600k. Again, hardly dead. You guys really need to try harder. Or you know, at least read because you say things that aren't true. Making yourselves look like idiots.<br />

I'm not interested in playing classic, but I can see a few things to explain it:<br />
- they have better tech now, they can use shards / layering as well (even if they said they'd keep it at a minimum)<br />
- this is an initial number; they'll make more as they're needed<br />
- they want the servers tighter, with more people so they have bigger pools for 40m raids and unassisted grouping<br />

Is that people? Or characters? Because I think it's characters. If the site could count unique players, we would know exactly how many active players WoW has I think.<br />
Also people are not tied to a realm, so they'd at least have to overlap if those were people. So I think that number is characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's characters. At 120, there are only like 3.9million characters. And those are without a doubt alts of folks. So is it as populated as it really seems? No. Of course not. My point was, even the dead servers, still have some active folks on there. Not every server can be a Thrall, or Tichondrius.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MisterGko</div><div class="date">2019-08-13, 04:40 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agentsi, I understand you can use the slider to see who is at 120. If you read the Realm Pop's page before you choose which region, it specifies how it gets those numbers. I'll quote one part on there, &quot;It's important to remember that we're simply counting the number of characters seen for each category. This does not mean the number of players, nor the number of actively played characters. We can't efficiently get activity data yet, so some characters may not have been played for a long time.&quot;<br />
<br />
So this means that it does not track &quot;ACTIVE&quot; players like you say. It merely tracks any character that has ever used the auction house or has ever been in a guild, ever.</div></div><hr />
