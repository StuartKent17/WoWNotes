Patch 2.5<br />
Won't exist. For the moment Blizzard is focused on patch 2.4 and nothing beyond that is currently planned. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3421022780&amp;postId=33532202127&amp;sid=1#2))<br />

PvP Additions before WotLK<br />
There is a new battleground and a new PvP zone planned for the expansion, and Blizzard doesn't anticipate adding anything new prior to that. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=3417082516&amp;postId=33543297809&amp;sid=1#5))<br />

Rogues got nerfed. But it was a deserved nerf, 31-30 was just too strong in arena. It will still be a viable spec, I guess. We'll see if deep sub specs will recieve something more and become the spec of choice for arena.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard: Ok, we will nerf hemo AND take AR off of prep, have you guys learned to stay quiet yet?<br />
<br />
The way blizzard have been phrasing the justification for these changes troubles me a bit. It sounds suspiciously like they want to discourage people from taking hybrid specs. I wonder if this is going to become the new balancing trend once WotLK arrives and if 21 point talents in general are going to start seeing some of their power removed and reinserted further down the tree such as:<br />
<br />
Remove the healing reduction from MS to 25% and add it back in as a buff to Improved Mortal Strike or nerf Soul Link and give the nerf back as a buff to Demonic Tactics. Considering the potential power of hybrid specs once you move to 71 talent points to spend in WotLK it wouldn't surprise me at all if a lot of the existing 21 point talents and maybe even some of the better 31 point talents start seeing changes like this.</div></div><hr />

Ambush: The damage multiplier on this ability has been increased from 250% to 275%.<br />
<br />
Buff, if you dont use it maybe this is Blizzards hint too start using it.<br />
<br />
Hemorrhage: This ability now correctly does additional damage when its debuff has already been applied.<br />
<br />
Again a buff too the class.<br />
<br />
Preparation now resets the cooldown of Shadowstep and no longer resets the cooldown of Adrenaline Rush.<br />
<br />
Basically, a decent rogue doesnt need AR too bring anything down. Plus the buff too hermorhage increases it damage if you spam it.<br />
<br />
Shadowstep now adds a 3 second, 70% movement speed increase.<br />
<br />
This just has anti warrior written all over it. Shadowstep, hemorhage, crippling poison applies. Run away with the speed of light, repeat, use rupture. Rogues will become more OP<br />
<br />
Sinister Calling now also increases the percentage damage bonus of Hemorrhage and Backstab by 2/4/6/8/10%.<br />
<br />
Buff? Yes of course.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pain</div><div class="date">2007-12-14, 10:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's a mere 5% if you have sinister calling. Odds are if you're that deep in sublety you'll have shadowstep aswell, and it looks pretty damn good now that it awards a combo point and increases movement speed by 70% for three seconds.<br />
<br />
I'd say it's a good tradeoff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all those amazing talents, increased backstab dmg, sinister calling, deadliness, serrated blades, prep, premed, shadowstep, cheat death, hemorage. <br />
<br />
combat looks like shit next to subtlety...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buff? Yes of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
There are some buffs, but overall rogue spec, AR/Premed was nerfed. You have to see the bigger picture here.<br />
<br />
# (2) Ambush: The damage multiplier on this ability has been increased from 250% to 275%.<br />
- dagger skill, every dagger build atm is shit except mutilate and even it is only so so compared to mace/sword builds. Mutilate would use CS 90% of the time even with this ambush buff. 1. its better to CS for the stun effect 2. mutilate is better with combat tree than subtely so you get no +crit for ambush = useless.<br />
<br />
# (2) Hemorrhage: This ability now correctly does additional damage when its debuff has already been applied.<br />
# (1) Hemorrhage weapon damage reduced from 125% to 110%, but the damage debuff has been increased.<br />
# Hemorrhage: Rank 4 of this ability no longer has its charges consumed by non-physical attacks and spells.<br />
# (2) Sinister Calling now also increases the percentage damage bonus of Hemorrhage and Backstab by 2/4/6/8/10%.<br />
<br />
as you see its an overall nerf to hemo damage and you have to go deeper into the tree, which is the blizzard's intention as they clearly stated it.<br />
The backstab bonus damage is nice but dagger builds already loose a lot of +damage talents becouse they are spreaded in all 3 trees and add to that that backstab is quite useless in pvp ( high energy cost, very bad damage if it doesnt crit, a lot of ppl with 300+ resiliance, very slow combo point buildup, hard to spec becouse of dagger talents spread in all trees, positional requirement....)<br />
<br />
# (2) Preparation now resets the cooldown of Shadowstep and no longer resets the cooldown of Adrenaline Rush.<br />
<br />
major nerf for combat/subtely builds<br />
<br />
# (1) Shadowstep now awards 1 combo point.<br />
# (2) Shadowstep now adds a 3 second, 70% movement speed increase.<br />
<br />
The talent was useless w/o that. The only 41 point talent that you could negate by....running.<br />
With this buff it sounds interesting and fun but Im not sure if subtlety tree will be viable in pvp becouse it might still lack damage compared to the other builds (mostly combat where most of the rogues will go back to)<br />
<br />
# Cheat Death: When multiple attacks land simultaenously, all those resolved after the attack which triggered Cheat Death will now have their damage reduced by 90% as intended. However, the combat log will still report them doing full damage.<br />
<br />
just a bug fix<br />
<br />
<br />
What really saddens me is the lack of repairing dagger vs swords/maces damage and utility imbalance.</div></div><hr />
