Activision Blizzard Q3 2018 Earnings Call<br />
Activision Blizzard has their earnings call today.<br />
<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard had 345 million Monthly Active Users in the quarter. <br />
Blizzard had 37 million MAU in the quarter. (Identical to last quarter) <br />
World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth set a new day-one franchise record with more than 3.4 million units sold-through. <br />
World of Warcraft engagement grew strongly quarter-over-quarter. The expansion saw strong participation in value-added services. <br />
Next year will be World of Warcraft's 15th anniversary, with events both in and out of the game.<br />
Hearthstone recently surpassed the 100 million life-to-date registered player milestone<br />
Players spent a record 52 minutes per day in Activision, Blizzard, and King games in the quarter. <br />
Viewership of Activision Blizzard games was up substantially this quarter, and in the month of October, Activision Blizzard had seven of the top 20 most viewed games on the industry’s largest streaming platform<br />
BlizzCon drew over 40,000 fans in person with millions more livestreaming from around the world<br />
Overwatch League continues to build on the success of its inaugural season with the announcement of the sale of another six teams in September, again at a substantially higher valuation than the team prices in the first season. <br />
The total Overwatch League roster is now at 20 teams, with nine teams outside the U.S<br />
Many top mobile games are based on IP originally created for console and PC, so the company is investing in mobile releases for Activision and Blizzard fanchises<br />
Fan reaction was muted, but fan's reactions at BlizzCon confirmed Diablo Immortal will be well received by players around the world.<br />
When the time is right, the team will reveal other Diablo projects in the works.<br />
There are a lot of players that are eager for more Diablo content on PC and console, that came through clearly from BlizzCon. <br />
Launching Diablo Immortal is only the beginning, there will be updates.<br />
The team is only going to release when Diablo Immortal meets the community's high standards. <br />
Taking a game to mobile with Blizzard quality standards can open Blizzard franchises to a new audience, especially in China where Blizzard is a strong brand. <br />
It's important that Diablo Immortal is an excellent experience when released. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Hearthstone Pop-Up Book Available on Amazon<br />
The Hearthstone Pop-Up Book (https://amzn.to/2JL9k7z) is now available for purchase on Amazon! This is a charming story told with the game's signature wit and whimsy, fully illustrated with center pops.<br />

Developers Working on Mobile Titles Across All Blizzard IPs<br />
In a recent press conference for Diablo: Immortal at Blizzcon, executive producer Allen Adham stated that mobile games for other Blizzard IPs are currently in development. Here is a recap of the specifics from the press conference. Wyatt Cheng is also part of the press conference.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BOVfw5O5c1g&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Many of Blizzard's best developers are now working on new mobile titles across all of Blizzard's IPs. <br />
Some of them are with external partners, like Diablo: Immortal; but many of them are being developed internally only, and they'll have information to share on those in the future.<br />
Blizzard's approach to mobile gaming comes from many people over the last few years shifting away from playing primarily on desktop to playing many hours on mobile.<br />
Allen says that they have more new products in development today at Blizzard than they've ever had before and the future is very bright.<br />
Diablo: Immortal is being designed with the intent that people of all ages can play it, and will not be a mature rated game.<br />
This is an opportunity to introduce Diablo to a much wider audience around the world.<br />
NetEase has been a partner of Blizzard for awhile and this partnership happened organically. There are developers here and in China working on this title.<br />
Diablo: Immortal being mobile was decided because the fidelity of mobile phones is getting to the level of being almost equivalent to PCs.<br />
Wyatt says that most of the criticism comes from being skeptical of the game, but many who have played it on the show floor started skeptical but thought it was awesome.<br />
Blizzard is always trying to innovate and this is just one of the ways they are experimenting with new genres.<br />
They do emphasize that they are working on multiple Diablo projects and the hard-core PC fans should take note of this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW Subreddit Developer Interview<br />
The WoW subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/) also interviewed Ion Hazzikostas (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9usbtb/rwow_blizzcon_interview/) during Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The major story arc for an expansion is planned out months to years in advance.<br />
The Alliance will learn of Saurfang's escape from a Horde hero in their midst and try to understand how a prisoner escaped from under their nose.<br />
There's more to creating a story than just listening to the community's perspective. Stories must have highs and lows then invoke different emotional responses from many different people in order to be meaningful and that means sometimes having frustrating moments which may be upsetting to some fans.<br />
There has to be a balance between highs and lows in a story.<br />
The PTR is when they’re more likely to take feedback from confused players and change things. Ultimately they feel that they need to trust creative impulses within the team and be story-focused, but they do listen to feedback.<br />
<br />
Warfronts<br />
<br />
The team admits that lack of clarification for how Warfronts cycle was not done well this caused a lot of confusion that can be addressed with better communication by Blizzard.<br />
Warfront cycles were created to give more content that ebbs and flows based on player activities.<br />
The new Warfront will have a rotating set of actual daily turn in quests while the contribution window is open. Different materials will be needed everyday rather than 13 things for you to do on day 1 and then zero for the rest of it.<br />
The team wants to focus on smaller chunks of world content available more often over larger chunks that are only available every couple of weeks so that there feels like there is more to do.<br />
<br />
Azerite Armor<br />
<br />
With Azerite Armor, they hoped to have a system where players are always building toward a more interesting upgrade - making new decisions on a regular basis, but they some of these iterations in Battle for Azeroth haven't translated as well as they had hoped.<br />
Having one spec trait to choose from and one generic trait was a major folly of the system upfront and they hope that the new second outer ring will address this by having several choices tailored to your spec to choose from right away.<br />
The hope is that adding an additional ring of traits will lessen the sense that there’s only one Azerite piece that you have to have for a given situation. The new currency system for targeting specific high-iLevel Azerite pieces should also help with that. <br />
They are still listening, still open to making changes as needed and hope that players trust that they care deeply about the matter and aren’t ignoring feedback because they think everything is fine.<br />
<br />
World Quests<br />
<br />
They admit that world quests have a lot of repetition and are looking for ways to address this, but the system as a whole is a much better one than past expansions where you only visited specific hubs in the world for daily quests after leveling to cap.<br />
They’d like to make world quests more varied and engaging than just “find the closest rare elites and kill them” to complete an emissary.<br />
Incursions are essentially world quests but are way more story driven and meaningful because they incorporate the war.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
The team believes that the quest system for professions in Legion was too heavy based on feedback.<br />
Later patches plan to add small quest content that tries to give importance to the professions that you have chosen.<br />
<br />
Legendaries<br />
<br />
The devs are open to having legendary items where it makes sense.<br />
They want to avoid past experiences of having players get lucky and being 20% stronger than anyone else because of it, guilds having bad luck and getting no legendary drops, or stacking players because they have legendaries.<br />
<br />
Guilds<br />
<br />
A lot can be done for the improvement both on the recruitment side and from a player looking to find a guild. That is something they're working on and will have some improvements to roll out later on in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
They want to make sure guild identity matters, but past iterations of buffs and level systems caused newer guilds to struggle to keep up, which limits the diversity of options.<br />
<br />
Crucible of Storms<br />
<br />
There will be a quest chain for both Horde and Alliance to explain the events leading to the raid. It will differ slightly based on faction.<br />
<br />
Sanguicells<br />
<br />
Enchanters will have new recipes that will actually convert Sanguicell into Expulsom for personal use.<br />
A universal cooking recipe will allow you to use Sanguicell in place of rare fish for the highest level of raid feasts.<br />
<br />
Emissary Rewards<br />
<br />
The team switched from random rewards to specific ones so that players could decide if they wanted to do the cache for the day.<br />
The rewards were recently increased to make it more worthwhile to players to complete emissaries.<br />
In retrospect, Paragon reputation should have been in Battle for Azeroth since launch to keep world quests and reputation more relevant.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We are happy about WoW and the record preoders and record sales in the first week of Bfa. Wow is doing great!&quot;<br />

When King.com is part of Activision, and NetEase is a big Blizzard partner, it's no surprise that's getting expanded on.<br />

<br />
Well there was some drama as people claimed this would affect Blizzard in some way but there were the naysayers that staunchly defended the fact that the news about it stated Activision had bought them and since Activision aren't involved in Blizzard's IPs, it wouldn't. It looks more and more like they were wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fidelity doesn't mean the size of the screen.. and mobile doesn't mean just mean phones. If you're playing on a 13&quot; laptop, the difference with a 12&quot; iPad won't be significant. Not everyone plays on the highest end of desktops, especially not when it comes to the style of games that work with touchscreens, such as RTS games.</div></div><hr />

Literally just means that 37 million people played any Blizzard game in at least 1 month during the quarter while 345 million played any Activision Blizzard game. Means nothing to the average Joe, really.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Activision basically told them to go make more money asap taking devs and resources from the pc flagships. <br />
A total disregard to the established fanbase just for the extra profits. They went so full EA its hilarious. Mike's timed departure looks so funny now. Like he didn't want to take part anymore knowing where they planned to go with all the blizzard games.</div></div><hr />

Whether you care for Az or not, I think this video shows enough all the Diablo aspects that (probably) goes away in Diablo: Immortal. I mean seriously, I didn't see ANY blood in what they showed except bugs that had green acid coming out of them.<br />

People aren't worried about it being a bad mobile game so of course once it's out it'll probably be downloaded and played a bunch and likely be well received (people WILL still protest in the reviews, however)<br />

In the end though, everyone's just pissed that it's a mobile game, period. They were looking forward to the next step in the franchise and this simply wasn't it.</div></div><hr />

This is the excuse a friend of mine used when I was complaining about the D:I reveal.<br />
<br />
He thinks mobile gaming is the future because of the power of modern phones. We both have the same phone. Samsung Galaxy S9 Plus. He uses the power and features of new phones as his reasoning that no one should be worried about D:I. Because you know... You have bluetooth controllers... You can use Mice and Keyboards... You can mirror it or connect it to your tv or monitor... blah blah blah.<br />
<br />
My thought is, if you have to carry a mouse and keyboard with you, or connect to a tv to make it fun, then you've already lost the idea of mobile gaming. Mobile gaming, to me at least, is playing a game in a car. It's killing time on the subway. It's something to do while waiting in the doctor's office.<br />
<br />
He doesn't seem to realize that the reason people are made is because we know what mobile games are like. (I guarantee you he has never actually played more than an hour of &quot;typical&quot; mobile games.) That, plus other reasons I'm sure are mentioned in this thread, are why players are pissed. but of course, he calls us entitled whiners, because we don't realize the true power of phones nowadays.<br />

This is why we were angry at Immortal. Most of us knew it was a portent of things to come. And now its been confirmed. Blizzard wasting their time developing mobile trash instead of making real games. <br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, they'll make a killing on these shit games. But in the longer run, this is the real start of the decline of Blizzard. <br />

Hard to tell honestly. It's an earnings call and they would certianly say something like this to lessen the blow to their investors, but it's also against the law to mislead them in an offical capcity. <br />

'Top' pay to win games? 'Top' most clickbaity games? I wonder what Blizz actually thinks<br />

I really hope they create Quality games for the mobile but id prefer them not to do mobile at all.<br />
But quality costs money and It is unlikely that any phone game will have the same experience as well done PC/console game<br />

I mean, you see the kind of insane shit big companies try to do regularly. It usually takes a large amount of fan backlash for them to get back on the right course, and even then they find themselves treading those same footsteps in the future.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrFiddleswitch</div><div class="date">2018-11-08, 10:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Blizzard never innovated; they just took existing concepts &amp; ideas and presented them in a better and more polished version. I mean come on, this is pretty much what Blizzard is known for - and they are doing it for mobile games now. Why people are reacting so negatively to this, god only knows, beacuse well, you could see this coming after mobile market's resurgence &amp; smartphones being readily avaliable for everyone.<br />
<br />
The problem isn't that Blizzard is developing mobile games - honestly, I'm surprised it's taken this long for them to have more mobile games after Hearthstone did so well. The problem isn't even Diablo: Immortal, which will likely end up a decent mobile game. I could easily see them tapping Warcraft RTS, Starcraft, World of Warcraft Pet Battles (pokemon Go with wow pet battle system and integration with your wow account pets - I would dump hours and likely many dollars into that game), etc. for mobile and be able to make quality, engaging content like Hearthstone has proven to be.<br />
<br />
The backlash from Blizzcon is that they headlined a mobile game that was meant for the eastern market at the western markets &quot;big con&quot;, and further added insult to injury by poorly setting expectations because they ran a massive marketing campaign for Diablo to the western market leading up to Blizzcon. We knew we weren't getting D4, but they could have (and should have) squashed the rumors of D1/2 remaster announcement or D3 expansion/character pack content. This was even further complicated by them having some seriously poor PR toward loyal fans when those fans asked some hard questions about this direction, instead of handling things professionally. This announcement should have been at PAX East, and the Headline should likely have been Warcraft 3 Reforged for this Blizzcon - especially since it too had a playable Demo.<br />
<br />
Another simple solution would have been a &quot;teaser&quot; trailer for D4, (which is obviously in development) ala the recent Elder Scrolls 6 or Starfield trailers from Bethesda E3. Just having a simple background of flames with Diablo like music and a logo would have been enough to completely change the narrative, regardless of if it really gave any details about the game. You don't need to show Diablo - or any of the characters in case the game's narrative is still in the &quot;flux&quot; phase of development (which rumor has, it is and has shifted multiple times so far). Just a simple announcement trailer to wet the appetites with followup at another con or Blizzcon next year.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it doesn't stop there either - based on what was said multiple times at Blizzcon following the DI announcement and then reiterated during the investor call today, they are shifting development away from PC for mobile, instead of simply expanding their teams for mobile. Hearing Blizzard quote, on multiple occasions during Blizzcon, and now to investors that they have, (and I'm paraphrasing here because I can't find the exact quote) &quot;Many of their best developers now working on mobile titles across Blizzard's IPs&quot;, is a real problem for fans, as mobile games should be there to compliment Blizzard PC games, not take over for them.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with Blizzard tapping the mobile market - it's huge in the east, and growing in west - but Blizzard shifting development to mobile in lieu of PC will likely lead to slower development of PC assets (which are already too damned slow vs. industry average), and likely a decline in the quality of their PC assets, as they are moving &quot;their best developers&quot; to mobile.<br />
<br />
This shift is what has long time fans upset and feeling a bit betrayed. Is it a bit entitled? Sure, but many fans that are upset, including myself, have been invested in Blizzard PC games for more than 20 years. To see the company that my money helped build shift their focus away from long time loyal fans in lieu of making a quick buck on the eastern markets is beyond disappointing, and I don't think it's wrong for myself, and other like me, that have supported Blizzard through thick and thin, to have a strong opinion - and further voice that opinion.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long write-up, just trying to break it down for you from the perspective of someone who is voicing their opinion in a polite way (these people that are flat out attacking Blizz employees really need to grow up!), but is a part of the negative reaction.</div></div><hr />

forum logic here would preclude folks reacting to this, because forum logic is that none of the 3 major subsidiary divisions of a/b are in any way accountable to a/b exec mgmt team. on MMO-C, such talk is considered conspiracy theory. I think the point of all this is to protect the belief that atvi exec team never ever has had the slightest influence on blizzard in any way (even though this might actually be illegal if true, fiduciary responsibilities and all that).<br />
<br />
forum logic does not discuss how the 4? billion in debt taken on from buying out vivendi was paid back by these independent divisions, or how the 5? billion in new debt from the King acq. is being paid back.<br />

the issue is, to the forum, the king purchase cannot have an impact on blizzard no way nohow - I suspect a number of posters would argue that blizzard doesn't even have to help PAY for the acquisition.<br />

Azerite armor is not an iteration of the Legion trait system, it's a bastardization. Having to continually re-earn the right to access an Azerite trait is crappy game play.<br />
<br />
<br />
They admit that world quests have a lot of repetition and are looking for ways to address this, but the system as a whole is a much better one than past expansions where you only visited specific hubs in the world for daily quests after leveling to cap.<br />
I liked daily hubs way more than world quests, so I strongly disagree with the contention that the former is objectively inferior to the latter.<br />
<br />
<br />
They’d like to make world quests more varied and engaging than just “find the closest rare elites and kill them” to complete an emissary.<br />
Sure, just as soon as personal flying is enabled.<br />
<br />
<br />
The team believes that the quest system for professions in Legion was too heavy based on feedback.<br />
So instead of making it less grindy, all that changed was the source. Yes it's marginally better, but that's not saying much.<br />
<br />
<br />
They want to avoid past experiences of having players get lucky and being 20% stronger than anyone else because of it, guilds having bad luck and getting no legendary drops, or stacking players because they have legendaries.<br />
Then what's the point of legendary item quality existing?<br />
<br />
<br />
In retrospect, Paragon reputation should have been in Battle for Azeroth since launch to keep world quests and reputation more relevant.<br />
Yeah, no. I had to brute force my way into getting all the Legion paragon rep rewards and by the time I got the last one (Valarjar mount), I had obtained Paragon of the Broken Isles (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/11653-paragon-of-the-broken-isles) on at least 13 characters. I'd hoped the system that started with Legion would also die with that expansion, but alas...</div></div><hr />

I watched part of Rhykker's video, and had to stop when he said he didn't know if he still had a job. <br />
<br />
This whole thing is just more bungling of PR by Blizzard. They cannot get their shit together, and it's beyond puzzling to me, because they can more than afford to hire the best in the business to handle things. Between their devs starting fires and their PR people stoking them, it's just a fun dumpster fire at this point. Like removing downvotes on YouTube videos...why? Just own it. Move past it. You're just handing ammo to the critics.<br />
<br />
And, can we have ONE interview with Ion without him saying some variation of &quot;We need to get better at communicating.&quot;? Dude. At this point, fucking DO IT, or stop talking about it. You've been saying the same thing since WOD. Nothing has changed. It's still you saying things, and people calling you out for it. <br />

The major story arc for an expansion is planned out months to years in advance.<br />
The Alliance will learn of Saurfang's escape from a Horde hero in their midst and try to understand how a prisoner escaped from under their nose.<br />
There's more to creating a story than just listening to the community's perspective. Stories must have highs and lows then invoke different emotional responses from many different people in order to be meaningful and that means sometimes having frustrating moments which may be upsetting to some fans.<br />
There has to be a balance between highs and lows in a story.<br />
The PTR is when they’re more likely to take feedback from confused players and change things. Ultimately they feel that they need to trust creative impulses within the team and be story-focused, but they do listen to feedback.<br />
<br />
Is Ion lecturing the playerbase how to write a story? Is he calling us confused? If the whole playerbase is confused about Blizzard's story, maybe the problem is not on the playerbase???<br />

Whether you care for Az or not, I think this video shows enough all the Diablo aspects that (probably) goes away in Diablo: Immortal. I mean seriously, I didn't see ANY blood in what they showed except bugs that had green acid coming out of them.<br />

<br />
From what I've seen fans reactions should indicate the game will be a pile of garbage.<br />
<br />
Translation: &quot;US/EU fans are rejecting the game, but they're not the intended focus. Don't worry, we'll print money with this game in China.&quot;<br />
<br />
They say in the call they're focused on the Chinese market. It's so obvious, I can't understand why anyone refuses to see it, unless it's just stubborn denial.<br />
<br />
There's a damned good reason why this game is being done with Netease, is PG rated instead of M, and is on phones: China. Period. <br />
<br />
Netease is already Blizzard's partner in China. They license WoW and Hearthstone and other titles there through Netease, and all finances flow throw them to Blizzard. Companies in China have to be Chinese owned to publish there, so it's a no-brainer to use Netease, and just fortuitous that they already had an MMO-RPG platform that could be adapted to Diablo, it saves money. Netease is ENORMOUS in China, they're not just some small game publisher, they're like the AOL of China. They will get this game into far more hands of players there, than in the US/EU. Netease also has the support systems for lootboxes and microtransactions in place, that Diablo:I can tie into, and more games in the future. It's all there.<br />
<br />
Fight it all you want, this is happening, and I don't think Blizzard/ATVI really cares what we think. If we buy it, cool, but they're rubbing their hands over the Chinese market, and building several more Scrooge McDuck money vaults to swim in from it. Look at it this way - it might fund more desktop titles. One can hope, anyway. <br />
<br />
More and more I'm convinced Morhaime stepped down, because he just doesn't want to run a mobile gaming company, no matter how much money it makes.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Biomega</div><div class="date">2018-11-08, 11:47 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem isn't that Blizzard is developing mobile games - honestly, I'm surprised it's taken this long for them to have more mobile games after Hearthstone did so well. The problem isn't even Diablo: Immortal, which will likely end up a decent mobile game. I could easily see them tapping Warcraft RTS, Starcraft, World of Warcraft Pet Battles (pokemon Go with wow pet battle system and integration with your wow account pets - I would dump hours and likely many dollars into that game), etc. for mobile and be able to make quality, engaging content like Hearthstone has proven to be.<br />
<br />
The backlash from Blizzcon is that they headlined a mobile game that was meant for the eastern market at the western markets &quot;big con&quot;, and further added insult to injury by poorly setting expectations because they ran a massive marketing campaign for Diablo to the western market leading up to Blizzcon. We knew we weren't getting D4, but they could have (and should have) squashed the rumors of D1/2 remaster announcement or D3 expansion/character pack content. This was even further complicated by them having some seriously poor PR toward loyal fans when those fans asked some hard questions about this direction, instead of handling things professionally. This announcement should have been at PAX East, and the Headline should likely have been Warcraft 3 Reforged for this Blizzcon - especially since it too had a playable Demo.<br />
<br />
Another simple solution would have been a &quot;teaser&quot; trailer for D4, (which is obviously in development) ala the recent Elder Scrolls 6 or Starfield trailers from Bethesda E3. Just having a simple background of flames with Diablo like music and a logo would have been enough to completely change the narrative, regardless of if it really gave any details about the game. You don't need to show Diablo - or any of the characters in case the game's narrative is still in the &quot;flux&quot; phase of development (which rumor has, it is and has shifted multiple times so far). Just a simple announcement trailer to wet the appetites with followup at another con or Blizzcon next year.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, it doesn't stop there either - based on what was said multiple times at Blizzcon following the DI announcement and then reiterated during the investor call today, they are shifting development away from PC for mobile, instead of simply expanding their teams for mobile. Hearing Blizzard quote, on multiple occasions during Blizzcon, and now to investors that they have, (and I'm paraphrasing here because I can't find the exact quote) &quot;Many of their best developers now working on mobile titles across Blizzard's IPs&quot;, is a real problem for fans, as mobile games should be there to compliment Blizzard PC games, not take over for them.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with Blizzard tapping the mobile market - it's huge in the east, and growing in west - but Blizzard shifting development to mobile in lieu of PC will likely lead to slower development of PC assets (which are already too damned slow vs. industry average), and likely a decline in the quality of their PC assets, as they are moving &quot;their best developers&quot; to mobile.<br />
<br />
This shift is what has long time fans upset and feeling a bit betrayed. Is it a bit entitled? Sure, but many fans that are upset, including myself, have been invested in Blizzard PC games for more than 20 years. To see the company that my money helped build shift their focus away from long time loyal fans in lieu of making a quick buck on the eastern markets is beyond disappointing, and I don't think it's wrong for myself, and other like me, that have supported Blizzard through thick and thin, to have a strong opinion - and further voice that opinion.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the long write-up, just trying to break it down for you from the perspective of someone who is voicing their opinion in a polite way (these people that are flat out attacking Blizz employees really need to grow up!), but is a part of the negative reaction.<br />
Excellent summation, and exactly echoing my own thoughts as well.<br />
<br />
We're not pissed because we got a mobile game at Blizzcon - we're pissed because we ONLY got a mobile game, and because of what the whole situation says about the future of PC development. And that has basically nothing to do with how good a game Diablo Immortal will turn out in the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This right here shows just how disconnected Blizzard is with their customers. The audible boos heard with their announcement, even with the audience reaction muted, was clear as day that the customers didn't receive it well.<br />
<br />
If that wasn't enough, the video upload to Youtube, which currently stands at 26 downvotes for every single upvote, clearly shows that the consumer thinks it is absolute garbage that is anything but well received.<br />
<br />
No Blizzard, you know the shitty mobile game is going to make you money hand over fist because it's cheap to make and will no doubt rely on predatory practices to ensure more money coming in. It may have been well received in the board room of the stock holders, but it definitely isn't in the eyes of the player base and customers.</div></div><hr />

the market probably actually likes this - it will be license revenue from netease, without a great deal of dev cost to blizzard ultimately.<br />

Yeah the CoD and Destiny situation is bad, well i mean CoD sold well no well for activition stand they want another 50m or something like that.<br />

Keep in mind, when Kotick says things like that, it's not directed at you, it's directed at shareholders, many of whom probably don't play games or follow video game news. This is all just PR for them, to get ahead of the bad press and fallout, nothing more. Kotick's comments are always like this - it's his chance 4 times a year to say &quot;Buy our stock! Here's why! Forget those silly fans and their tantrums, we're printing money, get in on this!&quot; <br />
<br />
We'll see what happens to the share price tomorrow. From an investment point of view, this is a buy, because the price is low, and they just showed how they're going to be making a LOT of money in the future. (If they don't fuck up.) <br />
<br />
What YOU think, as a gamer? Doesn't matter. Never did. Not on calls like this. That's why Kotick didn't even touch the azerite drama, and just bragged about MAUs and streaming numbers. They don't care if players are unhappy about pixels in a video game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Depends on what your definition of &quot;legit&quot; is. To a game publisher, anything that gets them profits is legit. <br />
<br />
This whole &quot;raising the standard&quot; is just the talking points. It's why the Diablo devs were parroting 'authentic Diablo experience&quot; the whole time. They're spinning. It's the bread and butter of marketing. <br />
<br />
And, every game except Starcraft has MTX now. Overwatch, Hearthstone, HOTS, WoW, and now Diablo. This is something new? Somehow MTX on mobile is worse than the WoW Token?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it is largely still a new emerging market. Everyone rushed to get in on the profits. Now if companies start making real gaming experiences on mobile that would leave less room for the shitty cash grab type games and hopefully drive them out.<br />

It feels the same as when we saw overwatch being built with such polish and launched at the time we had the biggest drought the game had seen. It's just shitty when the games that brought them the fortune they have is being funneled into projects with a wider audience while the original games are being left more and more. Now they are after an audience that has nothing to do with the audience that made diablo the series it is today. <br />
<br />
The &quot;bigger audience&quot; shit does not justify anything, they still are abandoning most of their original fanbase and the platform that allows them to get stinky rich from shitty games now. I do believe we will still get a diablo 4 and whatever the fuck for the other ips, but they are not a priority clearly. They are not going to be the games with the &quot;best developers&quot; or the most time put into them. It is like if your favourite metal band started to play some current autotune horseshit pop (sorry i have no idea what's in right now, in my head its that). That's what blizzard feels to me on many fronts now, they used to make games that felt like they were just made for whatever releases the dopamine in my brain. Now they are going forward with the audience first, then trying to figure out a game to reach as many people as possible instead of having their own vision.</div></div><hr />

This isn't their first mobile endeavor, Hearthstone was. <br />
<br />
They have to partner with a Chinese company, to sell a game in China. Companies in China that sell games have to be Chinese owned. <br />

Netease already licenses WoW and Hearthstone and other titles there for Blizzard. <br />
<br />
This is less about Netease's experience, because there are plenty of other Chinese companies with that, and more about Netease already being Blizzard's partner there, a necessary one, and that they have a game they can rebuild for Diablo is just icing on the money cake. I'd almost guarantee they didn't shop this project around to other Chinese companies. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard intended to make this game for US/EU markets primarily, they wouldn't need Netease, at all.</div></div><hr />

This whole &quot;raising the standard&quot; is just the talking points. It's why the Diablo devs were parroting 'authentic Diablo experience&quot; the whole time. They're spinning. It's the bread and butter of marketing. <br />

And, every game except Starcraft has MTX now. Overwatch, Hearthstone, HOTS, WoW, and now Diablo. This is something new? Somehow MTX on mobile is worse than the WoW Token?<br />

Yeah, it was the presentation, pretty much. We know now, that more stuff is coming for the franchise, so that issue is somewhat settled.<br />
<br />
The whole &quot;You guys have phones, don't you?&quot; thing is still obnoxious. They expected dedicated desktop players to just accept this, and it reeks of arrogance. It's not that they don't get the players, it's they don't care - and that comment is like &quot;Like, are you dumb or something? You don't get how awesome this is? Noobs!&quot; This was an obvious attempt to shove a game down the throats of players who didn't want it, don't want it, and have been starved for anything Diablo related for years. In a different context, in a different setting, it would have been fine. <br />
<br />
But I think that's been covered to death at this point. We all pretty much agree it was a shit move by them, and they responded by tripling down on their campaign. <br />
<br />
Again, their PR and marketing people are just awful.</div></div><hr />

The devs are open to having legendary items where it makes sense.<br />
They want to avoid past experiences of having players get lucky and being 20% stronger than anyone else because of it, guilds having bad luck and getting no legendary drops, or stacking players because they have legendaries.<br />
<br />
I dunno why they dont introduce some legendary random drop base on ilvl only<br />
<br />
One you have to be extreme lucky to get one<br />
You could put +5 ilvl over the mythic difficulty lvl drop. So if you have a possibility of a titanforged mythic piece of max 395 ilvl, the legendary would be ilvl 400 Which would be only a stats increase and it wouldnt be so much powerful that everyone would die for or whine about not having one. And it wouldnt be such a powerful item that the next content would make them obsolete and you would pray for another lucky drop.<br />
<br />
You could also introduce a grinding process to trade currency for a legendary upgrade. Pretty much like the valor points. It would take around 3-4 week to grind the currency and get one upgrade.<br />
<br />
That would be a cool and fun way to obtain legendary. You could also put some set bonus, like... <br />
2 legendary +1% increase dmg.<br />
4 +1.5%<br />
6 +2%<br />
<br />
I know the increased dmg % is low, but you don't wanna make it so powerful that you would keep them for the next content patch. So,this way, you'll always be sure that the player will replace his gear on the next content without having the problem to come up with some set bonus.</div></div><hr />

Now theres a head scratcher. I cant think of any top mobile games based on console or PC games. Fan reaction was muted? Now there's the understatement of the decade.

<br />
Anyone else wonder if not for virtual ticket sales if they would had even bothered with a conference this year? <br />
They've done it in the past and were none worse for wear afterwards.<br />
IMO the problem isn't DI alone, its that they offered nothing concrete to the fan base other than off the cuff comments when caught off guard. <br />
To us outsiders all we see is a cash-grab as the asia market where the mobile platform is a good earner for them already, the studio they partnered with already helps out with other blizzard products when their released there (for example in China where the company must be based within the country)<br />
The part about moving their best developers around doesn't install confidence either <br />

They were talking about the people who played the demo on the show floor. Every reaction I've heard from people who tried it was that it was pretty good / suprisingly good for a mobile game.<br />
<br />
This is one of the areas where they don't care if the core PC gamers dislike it, the people downvoting it were probably never going to play it to begin with. Their goal is to tap into a new market, especially in China.<br />

Logically, their end goal is to have PC gamers playing PC games, mobile gamers playing mobile games, console players playing console games. Right now there are a lot of untapped markets for them to pursue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Errrr.... what?<br />
<br />
I think they mean reactions on the stage were muted, but reactions among the people who actually played the demo and quite enjoyed it suggests it's, despite everything, good for a mobile game and could be popular among people who didn't go to BlizzCon hoping for D4.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep I kind of spit up a bit when I read that. Fan reaction at Blizzcon to Diablo Immortal was that most seemed so disinterested in it that they didn't even bother waiting in line to play the demo. The fidelity of phones has improved, but it's apples and oranges to compare it to PC gaming. Leadership that doesn't play games would compare the experience of a game on a 5 inch screen with no keyboard and significantly less processing power to PC gaming. That's what concerns gamers when we see Blizz doubling down on mobile and making out-of-touch comments like that.</div></div><hr />

Aka we ignored everyone who hates the idea of the game, didn't like the demo on the floor, or have spoke out against the idea of the game. However Steve likes the game and thinks it is going to do well... so let's listen to our lone supporter Steve.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is an amazing company that makes fantastic, well-polished, addictive games. BUT they were booed during questioning once it was confirmed that there would be no PC release. <br />
<br />
People aren't worried about it being a bad mobile game so of course once it's out it'll probably be downloaded and played a bunch and likely be well received (people WILL still protest in the reviews, however)<br />
<br />
In the end though, everyone's just pissed that it's a mobile game, period. They were looking forward to the next step in the franchise and this simply wasn't it.<br />
<br />
They WERE. Diablo 3 was pure trash cashgrab with one of the worst releases ever and broken to the bone. RoS fixed *some* stuff and then they just let the game stall. <br />
<br />
So yeah, as a Diablo lover, i am worried. They are showing to be below those standards, and Diablo 3 already was the most disappointing game for me, ever, period.<br />
<br />
It's not the same blizzard which worked as you said. You'll see when it arrives. If people are reacting as they are, it is because they are showing their new true colors, and we all used to see Blizzard as you described them.<br />
<br />
I trusted Blizzard the most and i don't anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how good a mobile game is, you simply cannot create the feel, depth, complexity and style of a fullly fledged pc title. It cannot be done.<br />
<br />
Blizz can make very good mobile titles which im sure will be fine, but they are not pc titles and its pc gamers that built blizzard.<br />
<br />
Entering the mobile market is fine, but they NEED to have appropriate PC titles being developed alongside them.</div></div><hr />

They could just say &quot;we moved devs&quot;. If they don't use the word best that doesn't mean they're the mediocre or redundant devs.<br />

And is anyone shocked about mobile ? Activision Blizzard bought King Digital entertainment in 2015. For 5.9 Billion USD. Didn't see this drama back then<br />

It means it's all PR speech and they're full of shit. Diablo Immortal is universally abhorred with only cucks like Jessie Cox defending it.<br />
WoW's BfA may sold the best, seeing how they've lured people with Allied Races in the pre-order, but I'm 99.9% sure the game saw loss in sub numbers from Legion. Most people I know and I have dropped BfA some time ago.</div></div><hr />

Activision Blizzard Q3 2018 Earnings Call<br />
Activision Blizzard has their earnings call today.<br />
<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard had 345 million Monthly Active Users in the quarter. <br />
Blizzard had 37 million MAU in the quarter. (Identical to last quarter) <br />
World of Warcraft: Battle for Azeroth set a new day-one franchise record with more than 3.4 million units sold-through. <br />
World of Warcraft engagement grew strongly quarter-over-quarter. The expansion saw strong participation in value-added services. <br />
Next year will be World of Warcraft's 15th anniversary, with events both in and out of the game.<br />
Hearthstone recently surpassed the 100 million life-to-date registered player milestone<br />
Players spent a record 52 minutes per day in Activision, Blizzard, and King games in the quarter. <br />
Viewership of Activision Blizzard games was up substantially this quarter, and in the month of October, Activision Blizzard had seven of the top 20 most viewed games on the industry’s largest streaming platform<br />
BlizzCon drew over 40,000 fans in person with millions more livestreaming from around the world<br />
Overwatch League continues to build on the success of its inaugural season with the announcement of the sale of another six teams in September, again at a substantially higher valuation than the team prices in the first season. <br />
The total Overwatch League roster is now at 20 teams, with nine teams outside the U.S<br />
Many top mobile games are based on IP originally created for console and PC, so the company is investing in mobile releases for Activision and Blizzard fanchises<br />
Fan reaction was muted, but fan's reactions at BlizzCon confirmed Diablo Immortal will be well received by players around the world.<br />
When the time is right, the team will reveal other Diablo projects in the works.<br />
There are a lot of players that are eager for more Diablo content on PC and console, that came through clearly from BlizzCon. <br />
Launching Diablo Immortal is only the beginning, there will be updates.<br />
The team is only going to release when Diablo Immortal meets the community's high standards. <br />
Taking a game to mobile with Blizzard quality standards can open Blizzard franchises to a new audience, especially in China where Blizzard is a strong brand. <br />
It's important that Diablo Immortal is an excellent experience when released. <br />

Developers Working on Mobile Titles Across All Blizzard IPs<br />
In a recent press conference for Diablo: Immortal at Blizzcon, executive producer Allen Adham stated that mobile games for other Blizzard IPs are currently in development. Here is a recap of the specifics from the press conference. Wyatt Cheng is also part of the press conference.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;180&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/BOVfw5O5c1g&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allow=&quot;accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
<br />
Many of Blizzard's best developers are now working on new mobile titles across all of Blizzard's IPs. <br />
Some of them are with external partners, like Diablo: Immortal; but many of them are being developed internally only, and they'll have information to share on those in the future.<br />
Blizzard's approach to mobile gaming comes from many people over the last few years shifting away from playing primarily on desktop to playing many hours on mobile.<br />
Allen says that they have more new products in development today at Blizzard than they've ever had before and the future is very bright.<br />
Diablo: Immortal is being designed with the intent that people of all ages can play it, and will not be a mature rated game.<br />
This is an opportunity to introduce Diablo to a much wider audience around the world.<br />
NetEase has been a partner of Blizzard for awhile and this partnership happened organically. There are developers here and in China working on this title.<br />
Diablo: Immortal being mobile was decided because the fidelity of mobile phones is getting to the level of being almost equivalent to PCs.<br />
Wyatt says that most of the criticism comes from being skeptical of the game, but many who have played it on the show floor started skeptical but thought it was awesome.<br />
Blizzard is always trying to innovate and this is just one of the ways they are experimenting with new genres.<br />
They do emphasize that they are working on multiple Diablo projects and the hard-core PC fans should take note of this.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WoW Subreddit Developer Interview<br />
The WoW subreddit (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/) also interviewed Ion Hazzikostas (https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/9usbtb/rwow_blizzcon_interview/) during Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Story<br />
<br />
The major story arc for an expansion is planned out months to years in advance.<br />
The Alliance will learn of Saurfang's escape from a Horde hero in their midst and try to understand how a prisoner escaped from under their nose.<br />
There's more to creating a story than just listening to the community's perspective. Stories must have highs and lows then invoke different emotional responses from many different people in order to be meaningful and that means sometimes having frustrating moments which may be upsetting to some fans.<br />
There has to be a balance between highs and lows in a story.<br />
The PTR is when they’re more likely to take feedback from confused players and change things. Ultimately they feel that they need to trust creative impulses within the team and be story-focused, but they do listen to feedback.<br />
<br />
Warfronts<br />
<br />
The team admits that lack of clarification for how Warfronts cycle was not done well this caused a lot of confusion that can be addressed with better communication by Blizzard.<br />
Warfront cycles were created to give more content that ebbs and flows based on player activities.<br />
The new Warfront will have a rotating set of actual daily turn in quests while the contribution window is open. Different materials will be needed everyday rather than 13 things for you to do on day 1 and then zero for the rest of it.<br />
The team wants to focus on smaller chunks of world content available more often over larger chunks that are only available every couple of weeks so that there feels like there is more to do.<br />
<br />
Azerite Armor<br />
<br />
With Azerite Armor, they hoped to have a system where players are always building toward a more interesting upgrade - making new decisions on a regular basis, but they some of these iterations in Battle for Azeroth haven't translated as well as they had hoped.<br />
Having one spec trait to choose from and one generic trait was a major folly of the system upfront and they hope that the new second outer ring will address this by having several choices tailored to your spec to choose from right away.<br />
The hope is that adding an additional ring of traits will lessen the sense that there’s only one Azerite piece that you have to have for a given situation. The new currency system for targeting specific high-iLevel Azerite pieces should also help with that. <br />
They are still listening, still open to making changes as needed and hope that players trust that they care deeply about the matter and aren’t ignoring feedback because they think everything is fine.<br />
<br />
World Quests<br />
<br />
They admit that world quests have a lot of repetition and are looking for ways to address this, but the system as a whole is a much better one than past expansions where you only visited specific hubs in the world for daily quests after leveling to cap.<br />
They’d like to make world quests more varied and engaging than just “find the closest rare elites and kill them” to complete an emissary.<br />
Incursions are essentially world quests but are way more story driven and meaningful because they incorporate the war.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
The team believes that the quest system for professions in Legion was too heavy based on feedback.<br />
Later patches plan to add small quest content that tries to give importance to the professions that you have chosen.<br />
<br />
Legendaries<br />
<br />
The devs are open to having legendary items where it makes sense.<br />
They want to avoid past experiences of having players get lucky and being 20% stronger than anyone else because of it, guilds having bad luck and getting no legendary drops, or stacking players because they have legendaries.<br />
<br />
Guilds<br />
<br />
A lot can be done for the improvement both on the recruitment side and from a player looking to find a guild. That is something they're working on and will have some improvements to roll out later on in Battle for Azeroth.<br />
They want to make sure guild identity matters, but past iterations of buffs and level systems caused newer guilds to struggle to keep up, which limits the diversity of options.<br />
<br />
Crucible of Storms<br />
<br />
There will be a quest chain for both Horde and Alliance to explain the events leading to the raid. It will differ slightly based on faction.<br />
<br />
Sanguicells<br />
<br />
Enchanters will have new recipes that will actually convert Sanguicell into Expulsom for personal use.<br />
A universal cooking recipe will allow you to use Sanguicell in place of rare fish for the highest level of raid feasts.<br />
<br />
Emissary Rewards<br />
<br />
The team switched from random rewards to specific ones so that players could decide if they wanted to do the cache for the day.<br />
The rewards were recently increased to make it more worthwhile to players to complete emissaries.<br />
In retrospect, Paragon reputation should have been in Battle for Azeroth since launch to keep world quests and reputation more relevant.<br />
<br />

This is one of the areas where they don't care if the core PC gamers dislike it, the people downvoting it were probably never going to play it to begin with. Their goal is to tap into a new market, especially in China.<br />

Logically, their end goal is to have PC gamers playing PC games, mobile gamers playing mobile games, console players playing console games. Right now there are a lot of untapped markets for them to pursue.<br />

And yet the polish is 100% gone now. They don't give 2 shits about polish anymore. It's ONLY about money.<br />
<br />
Beta test for azeroth says enough and now this outsourced scum mobile release... they are so lucky that so many people love their brand and that's why I hope they are going all in with 8.1 if that's shit too I'm done forever with wow. And maybe it's about time.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've yet to see a mobile game that wasn't complete shit and/or a ripoff. I think they are trying to get young audience interested in the Blizz IP and then pull them into the proper PC gaming platform. It's a decent strategy, however they should stop pitching these pathetic mobile products towards us, we are not the target audience and therefore fucking not interested.<br />
<br />
That's what pretty much everyone says.<br />
<br />
No one would have cared about them milking mobile turds that wanna pay 5bucks every hour to keep going. They see easy money so they go for it. I can understand that.<br />
<br />
But they give 0 fucks anymore and are fine with fucking any fan they have at this point. Fuck making your players happy, as long as the share holders are happy. Well we have been seeing that for a while now and boy is it helping them to get more subs!<br />
<br />
How can people that make so much money be so dumb.<br />
All they gonna do is end up like the next ubi/EA</div></div><hr />

They can't even make shareholders happy. Look at their stock values.</div></div><hr />

Unless you sold out and became a public company, in which case 'investors' will relentlessly pressure and stack the board to 'maximize shareholder value' ofc.</div></div><hr />

If Diablo:Immortal will become an ok game, they will contribute in getting better games for your mobile, so they won't all stay simple games. I think Nintendo's already pulling things in the right direction by getting full games to run on what's only slightly better than current phones. A mobile in itself isn't destined to be a terrible gaming platform. There have been huge technical limitations, but they are always improving. Casting to TVs is very close, I think. The hardest thing to overcome is getting good controllers implemented, but if someone makes a collapsible, comfortable &quot;console&quot; controller that could frame a large variety of phones, I think that would be an attachment that people wouldn't mind carrying around if the games were good enough to take mobile gaming to a different level.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fact! Diablo Immortal announcement WAS NOT well received, it was met with boos and mass dislikes. How can they so blatantly LIE that it was well received?!<br />
<br />
Fact! WoW is gushing out subs due to crap content and too low content. Even though they don't release sub numbers anyone who is still subbed and is not an MVP can clearly see it.<br />
<br />
Fact! Overwatch is dead. No major streamer still plays it, and that means quite a lot, ss streamers play what brings them views, and if they abandon a game, then it means it's no longer as profitable to play it because people aren't interested in watching it LET ALONE PLAYING IT.<br />
<br />
So...TELL ME LIES, TELL ME SWEET LITTLE LIES...<br />

Dude, who the fuck plays mobile games regularly in the west?<br />
<br />
What, are we talking little kids who don't have a PC nor a console? Are talking about the times we get explosive diarheea and sit an hour on the toilet with nothing to do?<br />
<br />
I'm a huge gaming nerd and single, and between workplace and my own gaming PC, I literally don't have opportunity or reason to play on my mobile. Can't see how someone else that is busier than me, would.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, most people do, like Pokemon Go and stuff.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
You know what the problem with your console and PC is? They are expensive, stationary and take up space. People need and want phones, and use them for everything, so they already have a &quot;free&quot; console built in already. The &quot;home computer&quot; is a thing of the past, except for a the gaming enthusiast, and that's why it's important to get good gaming onto the mobile devices. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Are talking about the times we get explosive diarheea and sit an hour on the toilet with nothing to do?<br />
<br />
I can sit on the toilet with my phone for 10-15 minutes easily, having a nice, relaxing shit, reading something on my phone or playing on my Switch. <br />
<br />

<br />
Well, for people not in a position to instantly flip from work to PC gaming, and having little downtime outside that, there is a demand, as is obvious when you look at the sales. Even the Switch, which you have to buy in addition to a phone, and a lot more cumbersome to carry around than a phone, is still a popular device that people use a lot in handheld mode. People like mobility, even if you don't have a need for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So they decided to mute that particular segment but not the rest then? Yeah that makes sense. Lying sacks of..<br />
<br />
&quot;Diablo: Immortal being mobile was decided because the fidelity of mobile phones is getting to the level of being almost equivalent to PCs.<br />
<br />
And top fucking kek to this one. Unless they are high on 32 types of mushroom mixed with a can of redbull there's no way they can't notice the difference between a 24-32&quot; monitor and a fucking mobile touch screen.</div></div><hr />

Yeah just like Heroes of the Storm.. even Heartstone.. all their &quot;new&quot; ip since 2004 have been far sub par to others on the market.. &quot;and prefire to triggered overwatch fans, CS:GO also much older and still better 5v5 fps game&quot;</div></div><hr />

We all saw them squirm on stage when their pitch crashed and burned nothing short of instantly when the word &quot;mobile&quot; was said...<br />
<br />
Americans should also stick to just saying &quot;cell&quot; instead of &quot;mobile&quot; (moble) seen as they can't seem to pronounce it correctly.</div></div><hr />
