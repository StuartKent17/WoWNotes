It's probably still a valid point, but don't compare a mitigation-geared DK to a haste-geared paladin. <br />
It is also the case that some tanks care a lot about their DPS and some just don't, even at the cutting-edge. That skews data. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321771823853363200))<br />
<br />
stop removing unique class abilities to just add X generic for all classes. Bring back mana burn<br />
We do the X generic thing to avoid too much class stacking / benching. Mana Burn we just didn't like. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321713759670398976))<br />

Hunter Bloat:EotB not &quot;bloat-&quot; Rotational and combat bloat is the problem. Ex.rather have Widow Venom baked in like war/monks.<br />
While combat bloat is a bigger problem, anything that fills up action bars is a problem. Venom would be a (small) PvP buff. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322389324408709120))<br />

why don't you want to answer to a question about hunter pet auto-taunt in dungeons? It's an obstacle that shouldn't exist.<br />
It's a problem but we haven't come up with a solution we like more than the problem. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322076811884371968))<br />

You made warriors dual 2h weaps you dedicated whole mop to locks why cant hunters dual 1h guns?<br />
It would require a lot of new animation and itemization and we're not sure the gain, while positive, would be worth the cost. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321338443156299778))<br />
(And whenever I say &quot;cost&quot; I am talking about production time, which is much more salient to our development than dollars.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321338599478026241))<br />

E.g., FB plus Flamestrike plus 3 GCDs of Blizzard weaker than 5x NT. FB strong enough, but fillers too weak so NT stays ahead.<br />
We were just talking about this. It's a fair point. We probably should have buffed the AEs when we buffed the bombs. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321721168979709952))<br />

Eminence not procing legendary, Glyph of Uplift isn't working with it. Channels don't benefit until recast.<br />
Because it's Real PPM (tm) as long as something procs it, you'll get the full benefit from the buff. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322446753611800576))<br />

Holy Paladin T14 4pc bonus feels mandatory because its better than T15 heroic items please do something<br />
Still skeptical of this. Giving up all of those stats on the higher ilevel is a big cost. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322389723807088640))<br />
Thats the whole problem. You're trading 4t14 with stats, the t15 bonuses are absolute 0. The 4 t14 bonus is also fun...<br />
I think absolute 0 is probably an overstatement. What you're talking us into though is nerfing the t14 4 pc. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322435686533849088))<br />

I quote in 5.2 &quot;We nerfed Phantasm and Psyfiend we didn’t want to hurt Mass Dispel or other utility that Shadow&quot; I'm confused?<br />
We looked, and very few Shadow took the Glyph of Mass Dispel, so we didn't think the cast time would be that noticeable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321669166513922048))<br />
I should clarify that I meant the glyph in PvE. We don't want to nerf PvE utility. We DO want to nerf PvP utility for Shadow. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321704368908935168))<br />
Have you considered giving mass dispel the colossal smash treatment? Pve/PvP versions<br />
We did, but it's more complicated than CS because we're generally okay with Disc / Holy Mass Dispel. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321715435403870210))<br />
<br />
A nerf to atonement means death to atonement. No one will ever use it and you'll have once again nerfed fun.<br />
I predict Atonement will be fine, just not the answer to every healing situation as it can be on live. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321665823989174273))<br />

is the ST nerf thanks to the DT Buff last patch? Was fun as a CP Generator, not as a wannabe autoattack spin-off.<br />
We didn't like it as a cheap CP generator. We wanted it to be for times when you couldn't be in melee. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321711555446177792))<br />
<br />
Potting as a Rogue is annoying, possible to allow pots usable in stealth?<br />
That doesn't seem unreasonable. We'll discuss. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321667061115912192))<br />

Curious as to decision on shammies and staves, would have liked Spiritbinding Spire from LFR as it goes well with Shammy T15?<br />
It's a tough one. We heard from shaman upset that we would give them a 2H weapon and not allow use of their shield. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321665996979048448))<br />
<br />
Based on feedback, we are going to revert the change and let shaman win caster staves (and maces) once again. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321792115040460800))<br />
So you will listen to feedback on staffs but completely ignore reasonable feedback to revert the totem change?<br />
Taking feedback isn't the same as doing whatever the community asks us to do. The design decisions are still ours to make. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322027908015194113))<br />
<br />
Is there any chance of re-vamping Unleash Elements, specifically for ele shamans? It's practically a useless spell.<br />
No immediate plans. It is rotational with Unleashed Fury and provides utility otherwise. The moving part is less important now. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321664342288379904))<br />

are you happy with the green fire boss? Its the best thing ever to happen in pve imo. Can you confirm it will not be nerfed?<br />
I can't promise it won't ever be, but it is self-nerfing as players get more gear. (Some players have done it very undergeared.) (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321316378894282754))<br />
<br />
Maelific G. and Haunt seem like they're too hard to design for pvp but they are perfect for pve. (Pt.2)<br />
Agreed. This is the heart of the problem. SB:SS also means individual dots can't do that much damage in PvE, which hurts PvP. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320261555537182721))<br />
But I should clarify that we generally like SB:SS in PvE. It's PvP where it hold Affliction back. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/320261656670261248))<br />

Once bloodthirst doesn't crit, nor proc and my rage is low. I have no other option than to wait for CD. Is this the intention?<br />
Yes. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322434564658180096))<br />
<br />
How many arena warriors w/o 2nd wind? If you just thought &quot;at what rating&quot;, cookie cutter.<br />
Might make sense to bake it in, but then warriors would not need a healing talent on top of that. Still evaluating solutions. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321436159119069184))<br />
<br />
Is it intended that Deep Wounds isn't benefitting from passive bonuses such as Seasoned solider and the SMF bonus?<br />
We like the DPS it is doing. If we made it benefit from other passives, we would lower the damage it does to compensate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321316505163821056))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
So Primordius now takes 75% less damage instead of 25% right? So what's about all those Guilds killed him with 25% less damage<br />
We had to make that change to fix a degenerate strategy. We also lowered his health to compensate. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322029376097095681))<br />
<br />
why the nerfs to 10 man normal?<br />
We gather a tremendous amount of data on raid progression. Some encounters were tougher than intended or compared to 5.0. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322394457276289024))<br />
so how many weeks should it take a normal 10 man guild like mine to clear ToT normal? just wondering if we are behind or ahead<br />
Typically the most relevant variable is how many nights a week you raid. There's no right answer, but fewer nights = longer. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322436607321985024))<br />
<br />
it sucked re-learning a farm fight. I don't hate on LFR, but why not nerf the maze hard in LFR vs big changes in norm/Hero?<br />
It was confusing in N and H too. The maze should be the challenge not the graphics and the run backwards part was just dumb. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322392491334709248))<br />
<br />
I loved 4.3 - LFR DS to reg/heroic DS with my guild on 4 toons every week. now I only have one raiding 90, period.<br />
You are comparing an overly long final tier to a hopefully short mid-tier though. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319166738057023488))<br />
<br />
Do you think anyone will do heroic scenarios without an LFG tool? You'd spend more time finding a group than doing content.<br />
We can't make random matchmaking content too challenging. If you have to form a group, there is some incentive to make it work. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319916362673827840))<br />
But it's definitely an experiment. We'll see what the response is. More challenge for more reward / efficiency could be fun. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319916488301613056))<br />
<br />
Looking at the avalaible data, ToT seems to be a heavy ranged favored tier, only rogues can compete in single. Thoughs?<br />
Pretty happy with it overall. Having 2 dot fights early on skews perceptions a bit. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/322439091121692675))<br />
<br />
What is your opinion on the amount of trash mobs in ToT? Most people I talk to (raid team/LFR) think that there is too much<br />
It's hard to get a good read on such feedback because players inherently argue for as little trash as possible. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318812750371487744))<br />
Yes players want less trash. I don't understand this anti player request mentality.<br />
Players ask for a lot that would make raiding easier or more convenient. That doesn't mean it's good for the game. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319242203132211200))<br />
Inconvenience for the sake of inconvenience is also not good for the game.<br />
Similarly, bosses without trash in between don't feel like bosses and the raid doesn't feel epic. Pacing is important. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319243564808818689))<br />
Again, opinion stated as fact. &quot;Feel epic&quot; is subjective meaningless term that lets devs justify anything.<br />
&quot;Feel&quot; makes it an opinion, not a fact. And yes, our opinions are important because we develop the game. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/321323232382828545))<br />
<br />
Pacing is important. ToT fails at good pacing. Why are you defending this?<br />
Because pacing is subjective and we're happy with it. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319517834810109952))<br />
<br />
Pacing was much better in Ulduar, just saying. This instance is designed for LFR, norm/hard are addendums?<br />
We always design normal first. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319515615347998720))<br />
<br />
A lot of pulls you need to &quot;tip-toe&quot; compared to past raids where you AoE/burn. Ulduar still best.<br />
I find AE/burn more tedious than anything. I like to be making some decisions when I play, even on trash. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318820801853943808))<br />
<br />
What was wrong with HoF/ToES/MV trash? Why did you need 3-4x more?<br />
The raid occupies a lot of geographic space... which is something many players were requesting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/318814933057941504))<br />
<br />
I'd like to get some clarification on the Secrets of the Empire drop. Is the drop chance shared between LFR and normal/heroic?<br />
Yes. You should not have to run LFR (for those drops) if you also run normal or heroic. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/319241980309819393))<br />

I'm inclined to agree.<br />
<br />
<br />
The blue-orange one looks... okay. It looks deserving of something like an exalted quest chain ender (or maybe a reward for earning &quot;the Stormbreaker&quot; title.)<br />
<br />
But the red-blue one and black green (http://www.millenium.org/images/contenu/actus/wow/5.2/wow_mop_patch52_raid_monture_armored_skyscreamer_01_hd.jpg) one just look so sexy... I'd say they're far more deserving of being the Raid Meta.</div></div><hr />

First off, if you're referring to the pterrorwing, it looks awesome. They just didn't choose the best skin.<br />

I don't understand this comment at all.<br />

Are you saying you think Holy is in a bad place just now?<br />

Is it possible that the T14 set bonuses where actually to good and that might be the reason Holy was so OP?<br />

No they are saying it is stupid that we are not upgrading our gear because of crappy set bonuses. It is a loss to upgrade to 522 tier even over just normal T14.<br />
<br />
Holy isn't OP. WoL healing ranks is about as balanced as they have been for a while, opposed to 5.0 being all monks and 5.1 being all disc priests. Now you see a mixture of monks, priests and paladins. Two healing classes obviously need some sort of boost(shaman and druid) but that doesn't mean paladins should be nerfed to their level.</div></div><hr />

And I said in guild chat before 5.1 came out how cool it would be to have a mogu ruins themed raid.<br />
<br />
And then 5.2 was announced. Blizz totally spied on my guild chat and used my idea, right?<br />

Holy paladins have not been the OP healing spec in MOP this far. They have strong points - and some very weak ones. The T14 set bonus was one where one of the weakest points (lack of movement while casting) was improved. But it did not make the class OP - just more versatile in their role.<br />
<br />
Tier 15 bonuses are very weak and would still be very weak if T14 was changed. The point that Holy palas are making (and have been doing for months) is that its simply not worth taking 2 or 4 set bonuses. They do not in any way strengthen the playstyle of holy palas or improve them in any way.<br />

<br />
True. Both disc priests and Monks are still way stronger than Palas at this point and usable 4 set T15 bonus for Holy palas would not change that. It could be shorten cast time on a spell to help the spec to deal with more movement intensive fights. Fights were monks are totally dominating now.</div></div><hr />

And yeah that mount is really ugly, can you even use it on Thunder Isle where it makes the most sense lore-wise? Takes up too much screen real estate for my liking too, but I guess it's a step up from the seasick Cloud Serpent animation.</div></div><hr />

But that means the T14 set bonuses are to good maybe? You can't see that? If 26 ilvls AND new set bonuses (however bad they are) are still a downgrade then the original set bonuses are to strong imo.<br />

This is what you called balanced?<br />

I would personally say.<br />
<br />
Druids, Monks and Holy Priests are in the right place.<br />
<br />
Disc and Holy Pally need to come down a bit and Resto Shaman (espec from a 10 man pov) need to come up a bit.<br />

Interesting statistics. Still - they do not really say much about the real things that are happening in the game. And neither do they show why these stats do not represent the reality that day to day players in WOW are facing.<br />
<br />
For example. Stats can be totally different in 10 and 25 mans for the healing specs. <br />
Secondly - other things might be influencing why some classes - including druids and shamans do not come out stronger in these stats. For example - in 10 mans there are quite a few fights where only two healers are required. That means one healer needs to turn into DPS and both considering gear and abilites- those two classes are more likely than for example holy paladin to step down. Cause holy paladin will need totally new set of gear while int based casters can still be very effective by switching out just few items. In that sence these two specs have more utility value than any other healing class. That does not make them weaker tho... if something it makes them stronger to get a spot in a raid.<br />
<br />
And thirdly. Things are still taking shape in this new raid. Stats you are refering to are in some cases no accurate considering that some bosses only have few parses while first have alot. And many players are yet to get their new tier set bonuses that will change stats even more.<br />
<br />
But your assumptions about posters here and why, how and when they play WOW followed by generalization on what ppl like me think of BLizzard does not in any way strengthen your case or your argument. In fact it does exactly the opposite. You are welcome to go on official forums and read what has been said about T14 and T15 bonuses for holy paladins. This is not just opinion from one or two players that you consider to be no longer playing the game and are just bitching.<br />
<br />
Edit - And guess what.... Blizzard nerfed t14 set bonus now on 5.3 PTR. Its now 1 sec but not 2. So their solution... is to ignore what holy paladins are saying... and just nerf them.<br />
<br />
Thing is... even with the 1 sec cd... its still way better bonus then t15 one.</div></div><hr />

And thirdly. Things are still taking shape in this new raid. Stats you are refering to are in some cases no accurate considering that some bosses only have few parses while first have alot. And many players are yet to get their new tier set bonuses that will change stats even more.<br />
<br />
But your assumptions about posters here and why, how and when they play WOW followed by generalization on what ppl like me think of BLizzard does not in any way strengthen your case or your argument. In fact it does exactly the opposite. You are welcome to go on official forums and read what has been said about T14 and T15 bonuses for holy paladins. This is not just opinion from one or two players that you consider to be no longer playing the game and are just bitching.<br />
<br />
Edit - And guess what.... Blizzard nerfed t14 set bonus now on 5.3 PTR. Its now 1 sec but not 2. So their solution... is to ignore what holy paladins are saying... and just nerf them.<br />
<br />
Thing is... even with the 1 sec cd... its still way better bonus then t15 one.<br />
OK.<br />
<br />
So I provide statistics and you just crap all over them because they don't back up your argument?<br />
<br />
There are over 50,000 samples for each class in that chart apart from Monks (about 30,000) and that is not enough samples for you? It is the reason I posted 10 man normals has it has the biggest samples by far.<br />
<br />
And your statistics are how many people are moaning and bitching on the forums?<br />
<br />
Now let me make something very clear to you.<br />
<br />
If the T14 bonus has been nerfed by 50% and it is STILL not an upgrade to get 26 ilvls and new set bonuses<br />
<br />
Then the T14 bonus is 100% overpowered.<br />
<br />
Can you not see that? Are you that stubborn and blind?<br />
<br />
To make it even clearer for you.<br />
<br />
The Resto Shaman T14 bonuses are worth dropping if you just get the 26 ilvls, without the new set bonuses, so let me play the worlds smallest violin for you.<br />
<br />
And did you really pull the &quot;you can go off spec easier&quot; so you should be bottom feeders of healing?<br />
<br />
Really? This is your argument?<br />
<br />
Holy Paladins have been at the top or close to the top of healing for a very long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And still you dont get it...<br />
Holy palas would still not be using T14 bonus to gain more healing power... but give them more utilities to deal with the content. <br />
<br />
I did not pull anything about bottom feeders. Just pointed out that the stats are based on ALL parses - including players that deside to build up both dps and healing spec gear and those classes are more likely to be shamans and druids at this point. If this game is all about meters ... then thats your problem - not mine. <br />
<br />
26 itemlvls will not change one thing if a paladin needs to move out of stuff and can not use any healing abilites while doing it. THAT is the reason why lower CD on instant spell is so important for paladins. Cause they have very few ablites that they can use while moving. Those changes to T14 will not make holy paladins change to T15... cause the players are still dead on the floor if a paladin has to move alot.</div></div><hr />

No I get it don't worry ;)<br />
<br />
You make it sound like resto shaman are running around with 7 instant cast heals.<br />
<br />
Oh wait....<br />
<br />
HPS is not the only part of healing (by far) but it is a part of it.<br />
<br />
And I just want to be 100% clear, your saying that our WoL parses are low because you think we are prioritising getting DPS gear over our healing gear?<br />
<br />
So Disc Priests have high HPS because they are not working on DPS gear? I guess they should be even higher by your logic then?<br />
<br />
Come on, get a grip on reality.<br />
<br />
So Holy Pally have high HPS and lack of mobility.<br />
<br />
Resto shaman have low HPS and lack of mobility.<br />
<br />
Yeah it sucks to be me I guess ;)</div></div><hr />

Blaming holy paladins for the state of resto shamans doesn't help anyone. Resto shamans have been buffed alot lately and full force of those changes are yet to be seen but the result is very obvious. When you take a look at the TOP 100 parses <br />
http://www.raidbots.com/dpsbot/Spec_Score/25N/100/14/60/default/#0000000000000000000000000000111111<br />
<br />
It will take longer for it to go work for the entire player base - specially in 10 mans where players need to switch specs. <br />
<br />
Why do disc priests not gather dps gear for raids? Probably because they are the class with the most healing utilites of any class atm. They have another healing spec they can change to if disc isn't viable. <br />
<br />
Why are druids and shamans the class that changes most between healing and DPS in 10 man raids? The answer is very clear - its based on the utilities that they still bring when not in healing spec. Holy paladin changing to ret will not give those utilites. Neither will monk. And both of those classes are a) Melee based that in most cases are not as good as range b) need totally new set of gear.<br />
<br />
Your way to improve your resto shaman is not to come here and shout at another spec. Make a real constructive post on the official forums about it. But again - do NOT expect the stats that you are showing from raidbots.com to tell the real state of healing in WOW. Thats childish and again - not what this T14 vs T15 set bonus for holy paladin is about. <br />
<br />
And neither is this about resto shaman having low HPS. They top every meter on fights where massive AOE is going on. Example... LFR where ppl dont move out of stuff.</div></div><hr />

So let me get this right.<br />
<br />
So far we have had &quot;Resto shamans are bottom because they can switch to DPS easier&quot; and &quot;Resto shamans are great in LFR&quot;.<br />
<br />
Would you like to spit in our faces any more?<br />
<br />
So we excel at AoE right?<br />
<br />
Our &quot;bandaid&quot; fix has been live 2 weeks so MORE than enough time for the logs to reflect the change.<br />
<br />
Megaera should be a fight we absolutely smash it<br />

Oh look what a shock!!<br />
<br />
You are moaning and crying that Holy Pallys are in a terrible place.<br />

I completely and utterly disagree, I am saying there are other healers in far worse place.<br />

<br />
Stop crying like 2 year old. Never said that holy palas were in bad place... this is about T14 and T15 bonuses. Get a grip and stop put words in my mouth.<br />
<br />
You have repeatedly shown total lack of understanding the the basics systems in WOW. Example. Why do palas and priests not go more dps in 10 mans instead of the shamans and druids? Answer... because druids and shamans get better DPS drops in raids that no other DPS class needs. At the same time every warlock and mage will have first choice of DPS gear over healing priests... and both warriors and death knights will be taking DPS strenght items ahead of healing paladin.<br />
<br />
What DPS spec is taking int base mail gear? What dps class is taking int based leather dps gear? In other worlds... both druid and shamans have higher chance of gaining better DPS gear than holy palas and healing priests. <br />
<br />
These things are not seen directly on healing meters. But its just one more explanation why druids and shamans are more likely to be the healing class to go DPS and do a decent job of it. And since both shamans and druids are there for switching between two core specs... they are more likely to adjust the stats on gear to work with both - rather than focus on one. Example... they might not necessarily be stacking spirit to the same degree so they can use that gear for dps as well. All this automatically means that shamans and druids will be healing less in raids... they are learning 2 rotations (healing and DPS) and are there for more likely to have lower overall numerics on both healing and dps meters. <br />
<br />
What you are asking for is that shamans and druids will be the most effective healers... be the healing classes with most utilities to switch specs AND have the best chance of getting DPS gear drop for their offspec. In other words.. you are asking Blizzard to make the game so that both healing priests and holy paladins will be left out of raids all together and we will be back stacking classes like shamans and druids. Again - shows the total lack of understanding for how the game works and how many other aspecs lead to the statistics we see on overall meters in the game.</div></div><hr />

I can't believe you spent time writing such utter total drival.<br />
<br />
So lets looks at the top 100 parses right? (top 100 is no where near enough samples imo and it introduces way to much rng and people solo healing 1/2 a fight as the other healer dies, but it is where you want to go).<br />
<br />
http://www.raidbots.com/dpsbot/Megaera/10N/100/14/30/default/#0000000000000000000000000000111111<br />
<br />
Oh look pallys still way out in front on a fight where Shamans should shine.<br />
<br />
I guess the top 100 shamans in the entire world are nerfing their healing to get dps gear right?<br />
<br />
Or the top 100 shamans in the entire world don't know enough about healing with their class because they spend soooo much time dpsing in raids and getting dps gear.<br />
<br />
That is the most flawed argument I have ever read in my entire life.<br />
<br />
Where will that argument stop?<br />
<br />
I guess Elemental Shamans are nerfing there dps to get healing gear right?<br />
<br />
I guess Unholly and Frost DKs are nerfing there dps to get tanking gear?<br />
<br />
Do you really have any idea how ridiculous that argument is?<br />
<br />
Have you considered that the Pally numbers are lower that reality because they include Pallys who main spec Tank or Ret and off spec Holy and get healing gear because it is useless to every single other spec in the game?<br />
<br />
I guess that never happens though.<br />
<br />
This is going nowhere you expect Pallys to be kings of healing forever and everyone else can go DPS, what a great attitude.</div></div><hr />

You dont have a clue do you. There are plenty of DPS shamans and druids that are unfamiliar with healing but are asked to fill the role for few fights. Parses do NOT represent the SKILLS of the players or how familiar they are with their role - the sooner you realise that the better. If you consider your value to a group beeing based on how good you are on meters (HPS or DPS) then you maybe should just quit playing now cause thats not what playing a computer game is about. And if your guild is looking at meters to determine how well ppl are doing... then I suggest finding another guild. <br />
<br />
But its true that holy palas get items that no1 else can use. Thats another reason to keep a holy pala in the raid. But 1or2 healing items for ret paladin will not make him effective healer or even remotely viable. Both elemental shamans and boomkins fill those roles much better. Its not just what I think on the matter - this is general view of every raiding guild in the game atm. If you can not deal with it then so be it. If not then dont. Paladins are taking a nerf with 2% lower illuminating healing. But I repeat here once again - this was NEVER about HPS. This talk was about T14 and T15 item bonuses. You turned it into a rant about HPS.<br />
<br />
http://www.worldoflogs.com/rankings/players/Throne_of_Thunder/hps/<br />
<br />
Shaman is toping HPS meters more often in LFR than Holy paladin. So do not act like shamans are totally crap. There are many different factors that explain what is going on in WOW and blaming it on low HPS is childish and just stupid.</div></div><hr />

OK I am sick to death of arguing with you, you win.<br />
<br />
Resto Shaman are fine, nerf them to the ground, because right now they are so overpowered, if you want they can just go DPS because they have the gear anyway.<br />
<br />
Buff Holy Pallys, make all there spells instant cast and make Beacon work on the entire raid.<br />
<br />
Long live balanced perspective on WoW healing!<br />
<br />
It is OK we have LFR to shine in.</div></div><hr />

And still you go on with untrue statements. 3 shaman healing spells were buffed by 20% few weeks back. https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/316652948455305216Thats Nerfing them more ?<br />
<br />

Sorry it was a mistype I meant just &quot;nerf them to the ground&quot; its fine right we can just go DPS? <br />
<br />
Or just heal in LFR where we will fell amazing because we are contributing so much.<br />
<br />
As I say you win.<br />
<br />
You bring such an amazing subjective overview of healing in WoW.<br />
<br />
You can be the lead healing designer in Blizzard I will give you my vote!</div></div><hr />
