<br />
Horde racials were veeery strong for a long time, so top tier guilds started gradually going Horde over the years for better shots for world rankings. These guilds attracted most of the recruitment pool with them, and now most guilds that hardcore raid are Horde because they cannot find recruitment that meets their standards in the Alliance. Currently the racials are more balanced than before, with some (like Void Elf racial) being overall stronger than most Horde ones.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alliance racials actually edge out in a LOT of cases, and the encounters are the same for both sides (only difference is Alliance faces Jadefire before Grong, while I think Horde have Grong first).<br />
<br />
The reason Horde is prevalent is due to a throwback time of Horde racials being WILDLY more desirable, and the vast majority of top guilds went Horde. Since then, they have stayed Horde and developed their guild scene on that faction, as there was no reason to switch to Alliance when the racials gap closed.<br />
<br />
The only reason everyone is Horde now is because that's how it's carried over from several expacs ago.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We’ll have to wait and see, sometimes the boss is so bugged/waiting on hot fixes that the day doesn’t matter.<br />
<br />
But if I’m Method I’m worried. Last tier was really close, and Limits going harder with undeniable advantages due to the day lead and the lack of streaming.<br />
<br />
It will be interesting to see if they stop streaming if they lose.<br />

How is that even relevant to anyone but the 0.01% top players?<br />
<br />
It have always been like this, the top 10 guilds battle it out and a few of those actually manage to clear it in a week or two (rarely if ever in a week), while the rest of us &quot;common people&quot; spend months clearing it.<br />
<br />
<br />
OT: <br />
What I've never understood, is why isn't the world first races just counted hours since raid opened, instead of how it is now? So NA wont get a 24hour lead, they just start the clock 24hours earlier.</div></div><hr />

Because it is a moot point you're trying to make. I'm one of those &quot;wait for mythic&quot;, that's the only raid difficulty that actually brings a challenge. Always has been.</div></div><hr />

They were banned for exploiting an LFR bug that allowed them to trade LFR loot for 4 sets on most of the raid, which were quite powerful. They did this by doing split LFR runs to funnel gear, using the exploit multiple times. Some guild got banned for doing LFR as a guild on day 1, finding out you could trade and reporting it. I'm not sure what kind of comparison you're trying to make between taking advantage of faction changing for loot and an LFR exploit.</div></div><hr />

It wasn’t for running LFR... it was because they figured out you could trade loot to players who were already loot locked so they made sure everyone got their 4 piece bonus.<br />

And that is one guild in the world. It doesn't matter that ONE top guild manage to clear 8/9 this fast. It's been like this for the last few expansions, the World First guilds always clear almost the whole raid the first few days, then finish it of the next reset with more loot.<br />
<br />
While us casual raiders are stuck there for months, which is what matters. <br />
<br />
The day mythic is cleared by a bunch of random people in some random guild, I'll agree with you. That won't happen though.</div></div><hr />

If it were a raid they'd never seen or tried before, sure. But they &quot;tested' the hell out of the raid on the PTR. <br />
<br />
I'd love to see Blizzard drop a raid of this scale onto the game with no PTR. But with the way Blizzard is these days, it would be a bugfest of Biblical proportions, but still, let's see how good Limit is without months of being able to get the right characters, right talents, and cheese the best gear possible before entering the raid. <br />
<br />
That's not coming from a place of anger, I have nothing against Limit or the other world first teams - but it's just not surprising they're going through it as fast as they are. It's like the teams going into the Super Bowl - this isn't the first games they've played all year. They had a little practice. :)</div></div><hr />

The US has always had a head start, but it’s been a long time since anyone actually gave Method a challenge. Let Limit have their win if they get it.</div></div><hr />

It was clearly not intended, but Blizz didn't say anything after it became obvious for a few days, so then everyone did it. Remember, this was two tiers after every single guild exploited to kill Atramedes because he was unkillable without an exploit, and there was no word from Blizzard on it.<br />

I personally don't care who wins or who the best guilds are, but the race is always interesting. As long as it's fair it's fun to follow.<br />
<br />
Please explain to me say if Limit were to get 9/9 right now and Method were 8/9, it's not exactly an even race, is it? Limit have had a significant head start. What am I missing that would say Limit is the winner in that scenario?<br />
<br />
Most of the time, the races haven't been close enough that the day would make a difference and you hope it's the same here.<br />
<br />
Other time context makes it clear that there was no real advantage. The last time the US got a world first, there was a bug on the first boss that basically stonewalled all the guilds until it was fixed so all the guilds effectively started at the same time. Blood Legion was world 3 behind 2 euro guilds after that boss but they caught up and got world first.</div></div><hr />

We aren't, you're avoiding the point. You can't do it, very few people can do it outside of the top .01%<br />
So it's a pointless discussion.<br />
<br />
This is what's happening.<br />
1. You make an invalid baseless point<br />
2. People correct you.<br />
3. You reassert your invalid baseless point<br />
4. People decide not to argue with a stubborn person.<br />
5. You get mad at them.<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;20 people on all of planet earth did it, must be easy&quot;</div></div><hr />

I just don’t understand why these inept mongrels get on here, say “wait until Mythic releases” and then say nothing when Mythic gets cleared nearly as fast as HC. If I didn’t have a point, people wouldn’t say “wait until Mythic releases” in the first place. <br />
<br />
I think it has a lot to do with the majority of them being white knights, and just can’t accept the fate that Blizzard has not a clue as to what they’re doing.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">huldu</div><div class="date">2019-01-31, 03:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">There are two types of guilds in world of warcraft. The actual ones that get top 20 or so first few weeks/month and then you the rest of the garbage that pretend to be good. The raids are never harder than you make them but a &quot;normal&quot; person might not have 12+ hours every day for X amount of attempts on a raid boss. That's what makes a &quot;raid&quot; hard for some guilds or rather &quot;most&quot; guilds because they're not bashing their head against the wall for that long. Eventually they'll start to outgear it and it becomes doable by design just by playing the game. Don't get me started on the people who pug raids... that's just sad and borderline pathetic.</div></div><hr />

It is the point, the people clearing World Firsts are so far removed from the average player - and even worlds above &quot;great&quot; players - that how fast something gets cleared by them is entirely irrelevant for 99.99999% of the playerbase and has absolutely no impact on anyone else's gameplay.<br />
<br />
Historically, bosses have always been knocked over quickly unless there was a specific cockblock from overtuning. Uldir was slower because Fetid Devourer was almost mathematically impossible, and required OBSCENE numbers and a shitload of brute-forcing to get through, then Zul was tuned heavy, then G'huun required hardcore raid stacking. Without the Fetid block, Uldir would have been cleared at a speed on par with how BoD is shaping up.<br />
<br />
If World First guilds get stuck on overtuned fights, how is that supposed to be done by the rest of the playerbase? Fights being cleared simply means that they are DOABLE by everyone else in the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Stay Alliance or switch back to Horde? No idea for either of those things. <br />
<br />
I think it would be funny if they had stayed Alliance because the charts would have one blue name above 4 red. Also &quot;[This game is bad] world first mythic dazar'alor&quot; being a legacy is a hilarious thing.</div></div><hr />

But with the way Blizzard is these days, it would be a bugfest of Biblical proportions, but still, let's see how good Limit is without months of being able to get the right characters, right talents, and cheese the best gear possible before entering the raid.<br />
The segment relating to this aspect goes from 13:42 to 14:22, explaining why Blizzard has not taken that approach since Blackwing Lair. (I can't adjust the player size, so I'm leaving it as a regular link.)<br />

Edit: To also clarify, this is not the first world race I've kept track of. I simply find this situation to be unusual.</div></div><hr />

They need all the help they can get LUL might pay off tho. I can already see the $$$ in Blizzards eyes.</div></div><hr />

Were those people not going to buy a token anyway? They didn't just see that Limit was on the market for tokens and go &quot;Oh boy I've gotta go buy one!&quot;, no they needed the gold so they bought one.<br />
<br />
If limit did anything they increased the price of tokens a little bit because they purchased so many in a short time frame.</div></div><hr />

Was it Paragon back in the day that spent way too much time on the one boss?, but couldn't or wouldn't change their strat, so just banged their heads against a brick wall.</div></div><hr />

Since they can train on the PTR there is absolutely no point at all....<br />
<br />
It was much better when everybody discovered the bosses at the same time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They are discovering the bosses at the same time... on PTR. AFAIK fights are hardly complete or tuned right on PTR (do they even release mythic fights on PTR?), so it's not like the top guilds are just walking into the raid to recreate what they've already done on PTR. PTR fights only give them an impression of what the fight is going to be like on actual mythic difficulty on live, so they can SOMEWHAT prepare. If there was no point and they already knew the fights beforehand, the new raids would be getting cleared on the first day, every time.</div></div><hr />
