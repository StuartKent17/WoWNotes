Rogue damage distribution<br />
Overall, we think rogues do too much passive damage -- autoattacks + poison. We want to shift more of that towards their specials, which will let both the finishers and the generators hit harder while keeping sustained damage about the same. It might mean less-skilled rogues do less damage by comparison, but that's not really a bad thing.

Tanking and Rage Management<br />
Early on in Karazhan you could get rage starved, and then letting off of some of the buttons for Shield Block or vice versa if you needed threat was a decision. I disagree with you that it was a major problem past that point. In the raids that followed you pretty much had enough rage to do whatever you wanted because the bosses hit so hard, unless you just got unlucky and had a string of avoidance or something.<br />
<br />
If you look at parses today of good tanks, you'll see them convert a great deal of autoattacks to Heroic Strike. Some of them can hit 100%. That implies rage is never an issue and they would have been able to hit the old Shield Block as often as they wanted... perhaps macro it even.<br />
<br />
Now if rage was a little harder to come by, then yes, you might make the decision between threat and survivability abilities. However, as a counter to that point, consider that MD and ToT combined with tauntable bosses and a lack of threat management fights like Voidreaver or Vael probably make threat rarely matter, so you lose the decision again.<br />
<br />
If we nerfed tank rage income in Cataclysm as well as nerfing the threat of MD and ToT, then I could see warriors and druids maybe having to manage their rage so they have enough for both threat and cooldowns. It's tricky though. If we went too far, then you'd feel continually rage starved, which is pretty frustrating. Having to manage a resource can be fun. Never having that resource to manage would suck.

<br />
<br />
I got into an argument on another forum, and I guess I can add a few things on my own site. <br />
<br />
I sincerely doubt that it's as simple as &quot;Thrall becomes the new Guardian&quot; and &quot;Cairne dies&quot;, this was the general idea when Cataclysm was announced and it leaves plenty of room for interesting lore twists. <br />
<br />
I still endorse everything I reported on the front page, I'm just saying that it won't be that simple. Now ... it's not like it's the first time Saurfang tries to take down a Horde leader before an expansion... right? And it's not like Cairne doesn't have any enemies. <br />
<br />
Edit: I also want to add that the lore leak originated from SomethingAwful forums, I am not really interested in spoiling that kind of stuff on the front page and assuming that I had more information about this, I wouldn't post it. (Except if I have to)</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but that sounds like you want to generalize the speculations, &quot;as long as some of it comes true, I was right all along, everything that differs was changed during development&quot;<br />
Sure, we think it's the other way around, you or whoever started this got at least some genuine information, e.g. Baine becomes the new Tauren chieftain, Garrosh (temporarily?) is in charge of the Horde/Orgrimmar, so let's deduct that Garrosh kills Cairne.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There is nothing to manage with a ressource that is depleted within 2 seconds and filled within 1 second.<br />
<br />
If tanks had 1000 rage and would be rage starved all the time, they could start doing some management with this ressource.<br />
99% of the rage is needed to sustain aggro/second. 1% to press some survival buttons. If Blizzard wants it the other way round all aggro spells need to cost 1-2 rage and you need some very good and very neccessary survival skills with low cooldowns (like shieldblock) that cost 50+ rage. Then you could start to manage anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Thank god, when more than 70% of overall damage comes from being able to stand close to a boss and not even push more than the initial autoacck button, that makes play feel a bit stupid. Good rogues have wanted more flavorsome rotations for many patches. Hopefully something will be worked out that will make rogueing interesting, if not fun. Right now utilizing engineering is the most in depth part of being a rogue.</div></div><hr />

This may be true, but rogues don't also have a 12 button &quot;rotation&quot; where missing one button = bye bye dps.. If shamans actually did REAL competitive dps (minus the 10% hybrid tax) we'd be talking different.</div></div><hr />

<br />
for every 100 successful melee swings a total combination of about 25 swings envenom/evis and mutilate/sinister strike will occur. <br />
<br />
So yea... as for your pvp, I don't know. I don't have the reaction ability to play well enough to arena, so I don't really know how it would effect things. I would assume they are thinking that pvp gear will = things out a bit since poisons and envenom don't have an armor table.</div></div><hr />

Well, I certainly hope for the sake of MMO Champion, PC Gamer, and the MMO Report that these &quot;spoilers&quot; turn out to be true. It would really suck for all of you on the factor of credibility if it turns out to be untrue. Not to mention Blizzard. Make a whole line of comics putting Me'dan as the Guardian of Tirisfal only to kill that and give it to Thrall.... Yeah, lotsasense there. ::)<br />
<br />
Might actually turn out to be true though and I'll have to eat a shoe if it's so, but you know what? I can live with that. I'm not the one who's credited to be a viable news source. :)</div></div><hr />

I for one welcome our rogue friends to the interesting world of appealing and demanding rotations (http://flyv.typepad.com/warcraft/2009/02/kitty-the-most-complicated-dps-rotation-in-the-game.html) (meh, this sounds way funnier in Ger (http://dict.leo.org/?search=ansprechend)man (http://dict.leo.org/?search=anspruchsvoll))<br />

<br />
Been a while since I really pvp'd, but from rogues, I disliked the mass of white hits in stunlock or lag-induced ones while I kited them 10y behind me more than the few styles they did. More focus on styles will even increase the disadvantage of bunny-hopping around a target. White hits are less prone to lag because the range limits are less restrictive when moving, some blue stated that back then when they were discussing the feral range bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I sincerely doubt that it's as simple as &quot;Thrall becomes the new Guardian&quot; and &quot;Cairne dies&quot;, this was the general idea when Cataclysm was announced and it leaves plenty of room for interesting lore twists. <br />
<br />
I still endorse everything I reported on the front page, I'm just saying that it won't be that simple. Now ... it's not like it's the first time Saurfang tries to take down a Horde leader before an expansion... right? And it's not like Cairne doesn't have any enemies. <br />
<br />
Edit: I also want to add that the lore leak originated from SomethingAwful forums, I am not really interested in spoiling that kind of stuff on the front page and assuming that I had more information about this, I wouldn't post it. (Except if I have to) <br />
<br />
<br />
No I have gathered that the whole Cairne deal might be a bit more complicated then I first thought, and that we have a lot to learn about it. That it might have to do with the Grimtotem, or whatnot. Or the real reasons that Thrall goes out on a boat trip, which we ain't really clear on.<br />
<br />
But I thought that Thrall was gonna go work with the Earthen Ring, and Cairne might hitch a ride on that project. Thrall just doesnt, even if the story around it could be complicated, have the necessities for becoming or thinking about being a Guardian.<br />
Maybe Cairne does a Wrynn? Now there's a thought. Hmm.</div></div><hr />

One thing I would like to hear from BB is that he's at least taken consideration into what's already been established in the comics, that is Me'dan already getting the title of Guardian, and then couple it with this thing about Thrall. Were there any questions being asked that run along the line of &quot;It doesn't make any sense that they would establish this in one media only to switch it over to this for the benefit of a different media&quot; before reporting that this is a genuine spoiler?<br />
<br />

<br />
I don't understand the mentality that its more skillful/fun/whatever to have to spam a single button over and over again in order to do any dps. Take a elemental shaman for example... their rotation is basically spamming LB, keeping FS up, and using LvB off cooldown. Now.. imagine there was an auto LB button, so that you don't have to constantly press the '1' button over and over again.. would that make the class any less challenging or fun to play...</div></div><hr />

<br />
...Yes? If mages automatically casted frostfirebolts, if warlocks automatically shadowbolted, if priests automatically mindflayed - it reduces the attention required and simplifies things. <br />
<br />
There's a reason why people in the same gear do (wildly) different DPS. Reaction time, hesitation, familiarity with rotation (especially when things like movement are introduced) and when to best make use of cooldowns. Blizzard thinks rogues do too much by right-clicking and standing in melee range.<br />

While some reported that it was hotfixed on their server...others have reported it wasn't on other servers. The tooltip still has yet to be updated to reflect any actual change (still says 6%). It's been so long now, I don't know that I ever saw an increase in my health.<br />

And for those whining about The Looking For Group/BG/Event Boss tools and long for the good 'ol days, you have a very skewed memory of what the &quot;good 'ol days&quot; were. Standing in one city looking for a group in General or Trade chat (there was no LookingForGroup chat or tool at all, not that many use the proper chat now), the chats were not linked between cities, there were no meeting stones, you couldn't summon into dungeons...etc, etc. If you think those days were better, or that somehow you are trapped in the cities now as opposed to then...you are an idiot.</div></div><hr />
