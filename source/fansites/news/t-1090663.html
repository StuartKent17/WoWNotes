WoW Ironman Challenge Completed<br />
You may remember that a community run challenge (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/217313-till-death-do-you-part/) became popular a while back which involves leveling to 85 with no deaths, as well as other restrictions. Kripparrian of Turalyon (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/turalyon/Kripparrian/advanced) recently completed the Challenge with his Hunter, and Nik (http://www.youtube.com/user/n1kftw) had the chance to ask him a few questions about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/february/ironmanFirst.jpg (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/turalyon/Kripparrian/advanced)<br />
<br />
So go ahead, why don't you introduce yourself.<br />
My name is Octavian, I enjoy LCD tanning at my computer desk, newly vegan, and live in Toronto Canada. When I'm not working or cycling, I play online games as Kripp (Kripparrian). I primarily play WoW PvE with Exodus. Before playing WoW, under other alias', I played Dark Age of Camelot for about 7 years, and Diablo 2 HCCL (Hardcore Classic Ladder) on and off.<br />
<br />
What inspired you to attempt the Ironman challenge?<br />
I heard about the challenge 3 weeks ago, once it had already become a fairly well known movement. It was clearly created as a non-competitive activity, but the way I see it; if you have a ladder for something -- its competitive. As such, the challenge really appealed to my taste of activity within a game. I thought that if anyone was to complete it, it would be someone like me (as I'm sure many people feel).<br />
<br />
Why did you chose Hunter to completed the challenge?<br />
Well, I have played a Hunter for nearly all my time playing WoW. The only other class I know how to play reasonably well is a DK, and they are against the general rules of the challenge. My mains armory can be found here (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/Cho%27Gall/Kripp/advanced) and hunter that I used to complete the challenge here (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/character/turalyon/Kripparrian/advanced).<br />
<br />
How long did it take you and what was the majority of your time spent doing?<br />
My first try was on Feb 12th, and I died at level 23 on the Mor'shan Caravan Delivery quest. I have not done the new Cata quests before this challenge and my inexperience followed by my death caused me to take a more cautious approach until level 60. I made the final character on the 13th and have played as much as I could until yesterday when I hit 85 at 4 days 17 hours 40 minutes played. All my in game time was spent on questing, I did not spend any time with the AH or trades as I felt it would be considered outside help -- although allowed by the rules of the challenge.<br />
<br />
Do you think it's even possible to be able to complete it using another class?<br />
I think any class can make it to 85. However, most classes will have to stick it out in WotLK zones and level to 85 with dailies as Cata mobs are brutal. Using the safe daily approach takes a lot more in-game time, leaving your character more prone to mistakes and disconnects. I think the chance of success with this method is about the same for those reasons.<br />
<br />
Was there any planning involved regarding it all?<br />
Of course! I really played this challenge to be the first to 85 -- and with others having a several week head start, my strategy was to make it near the top as soon as possible, then begin applying pressure. Last Wednesday (I get Wednesdays off work) I managed to play 14 hours straight;. During this time I leveled from 70 to 79 in one sitting and managed to pass all of the 3-4 of the challengers ahead of me. I was hoping to put a scare on the others near the top, and make them think they're behind, forcing them to play outside of their comfort range. Did it work? I don't know for sure, but when I was at work the next day, everybody else over 70 managed to die off. With this newly acquired 10 level lead, I changed my game plan to being more cautious. When I hit 81 after a couple days, I developed a game plan that I felt was safe enough, while still securing my lead in the challenge, you can check it out here (http://i.imgur.com/FBKnb.jpg). I had to change my game plan and go to Deepholm in the middle of Vashjir questing because the quest &quot;Looking Forward&quot; bugged, and I was not able to continue the main quest chain.<br />
<br />
Any tips for those following in your footsteps and attempt the Ironman Challenge?<br />
Have patience with this, but don't waste your in-game time. You may still see it as a race, as I did, but every action should prioritize security. If you have to use the bathroom, look up a quest, or check on something, log out! Utilize your in-game time only towards leveling, as being logged in just about anywhere has its potential risks -- falling through the world, kill exploits, etc.<br />
<br />
Any shoutouts that you'd like to give?<br />
I want to thank all the people participating in the Ironman Challenge for making it such a unique and special experience. Those who have supported it at wowironman.com (http://wowironman.com/) and the many individuals on The Official Ironman Challenge Thread (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4015202822?page=1). I am also grateful for the people that have given me their support and encouragement; the many on the forums, my YouTube subscribers, Taeyeon and Ennuo from Exodus, and my online friend of 10 years Krippie.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your time Kripparrian. If you'd like more from him or his guild you can check his Youtube (http://www.youtube.com/user/Kripparrian) channel or guild website (http://www.exo-guild.com/). Kripparrian has also uploaded a video (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnpttCCouXM) where he talks more in detail about the challenge.<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Dev Watercooler - Question about stats<br />
I think this sentence of the blog is important to note: First of all, please note that we actually aren’t making many stat changes compared to the ones we made in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
That doesn't mean nothing is changing with the other stats. But if said changes aren't laid out in Greg's latest blog, chances are the changes aren't as broad in scope.<br />
<br />
We'll start digging into the meat of the other stats and how we plan for them to play out in Mists of Pandaria class design soon enough. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/218357-dev-watercooler-question-about-stats/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4138433949#2))<br />
<br />
Naxx Achievement Drakes<br />
In some cases, we like to keep the mounts for those that managed to complete the content when it was at its peak. I think of it as a nod to the effort that went into achieving the task. Isn't it a good thing that, as Kazera said, some things can stay rare? (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/218191-naxx-10-25-proto-drakes/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3430033806#5))<br />
<br />
WoW Training Grounds<br />
The WoW training grounds is a max-level training ground with scripted training for each class and each of their specs.<br />
We've discussed a similar idea in the past, and it might be possible to use the technology we're using to build out the Scenarios coming in Mists to make something like this happen at some point in the future. Maybe!<br />
<br />
It would be cool. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/218234-wow-training-grounds-youll-never-be-the-same/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4079845898?page=2#38))<br />
<br />
PvP Balance<br />
We are sorry to hear that you feel that we perform sweeping game changes in expansions and that it makes the game more difficult for us to balance; each expansion has come with changes that presented their own unique challenges and we would like to feel that we overcame these with varying degrees of success, but success none-the-less. We are our own harshest critic mind you, and we are not afraid to say that some things did not work out as planned though.<br />
<br />
In regards to this particular comment: I think that if blizz instead stopped adding that many spells and instead focused on fixing what we have, not creating something new, then the game would be better.<br />
<br />
You have to remember that World of Warcraft is an incredibly complex machine and while we can make small changes and tweaks as we go along, things that affect multiple systems aren’t so simply changed in that way. We do the best that we can to make the minor adjustments wherever possible, but expansions afford us the opportunity to make those larger changes that will help improve and balance the game, and apply the resources we need to do them.<br />
<br />
These changes we are making to things such as abilities, talents and other systems are designed to try and create compelling choices and engaging content, for the betterment of both PvP and PvE. We just want to be sure that you know that none of the changes made through an expansion are done on a whim, they are incredibly thought out and made to ensure that the game will be as balanced and enjoyable as possible for everyone come its release.<br />
<br />
We have a lot of information that will be coming out over the following weeks regarding Mists of Pandaria, covering both the changes in store for PvP and PvE. We hope that you look forward to reading it as much as we are excited to be bringing it to you! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/218311-the-adding-of-expansion-packs-effect-on-pvp/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3429934356#2))<br />
<br />
PvP Ignored?<br />
I'm not going to go point by point right now, but I do want to reassure you that we're not ignoring PvP. We're definitely aware of the concerns that players have and like much of the current development, are working on many things for the future of World of Warcraft (as a whole) and Mists of Pandaria. With the press tour coming up in March, we can hopefully be able to get you a better look at what we have planned and how we're planning to address things such as the PvP concerns that people have and have been expressing. I'm not going to promise that we'll &quot;fix&quot; everything that everyone has concerns about because that's not something we can ever guarantee, but we will be keeping a close eye on all of the (constructive) feedback that we expect you will have. We also look forward to when we'll be able to get community members into the beta test (when it occurs) to give it a first-hand look as well. <br />
<br />
For those who are falling back to &quot;Next expansion pack will fix it&quot; as a complaint-- The most I can say is that this is the cycle of MMO development. As you also know, we've generally made changes that affect the game as a whole available to anyone regardless of whether they have purchased the new expansion pack or not as well as add content that is available via the expansion. That said though, I'm not making any guarantees of anything at this point in time, but I want the door left open for the possibilities. We'll be doing our best to explain all of this in the near future as I've mentioned.<br />
<br />
Will you please confirm that those of us on PvE servers who do not want or care for world PvP will not find themselves forced into PvP...<br />
I can't address these concerns for you right now, but we're aware of them and as I've mentioned in prior posts, we want to make sure what we're doing allows for PvP without infringing on those who are not as interested in taking part. The devil (as always) is in the details, however and we'll make sure to share those details with you all when we can so we can get your feedback. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/218241-ignore-pvp-any-longer/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4079626409?page=7#123))<br />
<br />
New Race and Class Combinations<br />
Well, we're adding the pandaren and monk in Mists of Pandaria and the monk class will be available to all races save for goblin and worgen, so you could say that, &quot;yes, we're still adding new race/class combos.&quot; That said, we want to make sure that when we add things like this that they make sense for the longevity of the game so we can't make any guarantees as to what or how often these will be added into the game. Balancing new classes into the game is a bit more difficult than adding a new race, but there are obviously complexities to both. <br />
<br />
Will races will get other classes. Remember how Cata got Human Hunters, Night Elf Mages, Tauren Paladins, etc...?<br />
That too is always a possibility if the developers feel it makes sense, but it would still incur some amount of additional development to make it all fit within the world both in terms of the story and in terms of items/gear.

To be considered part of the challenge there is some ladder out there you get put on, that tracks certain things that are against the rules. He is the first one who did it on the ladder. If not done on the ladder it does not count I believe. If you have not tried it and are thinking its easy, its really hard near the end.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the hunter class is a little bit easier then the other classes considering not all of your stats go to your pet only some of them do, also armor is a stat that isnt effected by the hunter so the pet is just as tough but he has less health.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hunters do have it easier its a fact. Even if the pet dies in say 2-4 hits that's 2-4 extra hits that the hunter isn't getting hurt. That gives the hunter time to lay down some smack on a mob and get some range once the pet dies.</div></div><hr />

I have spoken with Krip personally to make sure this was all correct before posting. The offical Ironman website validates this and I hope this clears stuff up for a few people.</div></div><hr />

So they're probly looted and not fished and still count towards the achievement. If you check the statistics they show &quot; - &quot; in the number of fishes fished. Anyways i don't see him thinking all of a sudden &quot;oh yeah i'm in a hurry but first... let's stop 2sec and fish something just to lose time and fail the challenge&quot; <br />
<br />
Gratz to him. I still think doing this with a hunter was the easy way to go, as dedicated as he seems to be i'm sure he could've been able to do it with another class but meh... :)<br />

An exception is made for First Aid.&quot; If you don't believe me check his armory and the rule page. He didn't complete the challenge.<br />

This notion of OMG HUNTER LOL, it's not just hunters, guys. <br />
<br />
- Mages using Frostbolt, CoC, Nova, Frost Armor, Ice Lance, etcetc. Mages would be relatively easy.<br />
- Warlocks have pets, too.<br />
- Paladins have bubble, a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot;, more or less, for those looking at FD.<br />
- Rogues could cloak / vanish if in danger.<br />

Wrong its another way to play the game, after you've cleared 8/8 HM there is little more to do, ironman challenge was something different to do too pass the time. Bitching for the sake of bitching should be an achievement id say alot of you would be contenders for world first.</div></div><hr />

I agree, the Ironman is nothing for me and Ill be the first to admit that, however if its something others would do for enjoyment then I take my hat off to them because there is NO WAY I could do this. As for &quot;Wasting time&quot; everyone who does anything in any game is wasting time. Raiding, PVP, Farming, Gearing up, its all one big waste of time but people do it for FUN. I find hardcore raiding to be pointless, dull and boring but I don't run around pointing fingers and calling them names, unless they act like some sort of snob to me.</div></div><hr />

In some cases, we like to keep the mounts for those that managed to complete the content when it was at its peak. I think of it as a nod to the effort that went into achieving the task. Isn't it a good thing that, as Kazera said, some things can stay rare? (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/218191-naxx-10-25-proto-drakes/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/3430033806#5))<br />
The proto-drake mounts from 10/25 aren't the greatest example to go for. Everyone knows (or at least ought to) that Naxx 25 was under-tuned and its 10-player counterpart was over-tuned. It was no problem, though, for a realm's top guild to rush to 80 and trounce everything in their T6 gear.<br />

Getting 0 deaths in WoW is hardly hard.I recently started playing GW and they have this sort of achievement for real. Multiple levels of it too. Between the lag, the actually hard-hitting mobs, no-gimmicky things like flying and the RPG mechanics of it all... it is actually quite a challenge. Don't mean to knock this guy but this is a joke. Levelling to 60 or even 70 without any deaths is impressive. Nowadays? LOL.<br />

I would say either your reading comprehension is severely lacking or you're just trolling. It's not just not dying, it's all the other limitations the challenge involves which are described in the link in the post.</div></div><hr />

I really think ppl over estimate a NORMAL (Read NOT bm) pet. Without talents or gear. They hit for really pathetic numbers. Yes i do belive hunter are the easiest class to do the challange but still a great feat by Kripp, GZ :D</div></div><hr />

As to those saying that hunter was 'easymode' due to pet, traps and FD...<br />
Every class really has ways to get out of stuff. That's why playing what you know is the key to victory.<br />
I'm currently going Paladin (My main's a paladin... Same name as here on the forums; Arthas server), but I've added a few 'personal rules' for myself. <br />
<br />
I will not have ANY professions... not taking First Aid. <br />

Yes hunters are probably the best class to pick but that doesn't mean it's easy. My character is lvl 24 and it takes a lot of concentration and every pull is a possible hazard. For example: I thought at one point I was pulling 2 mobs by sending in my pet. It turned out there were 3 mobs and I had to use all my skills (at lvl 17!) to stay alive. Only my years of experience playing a hunter as my main helped me here, not my squishy pet or a simple Feign Death (you get at lvl 32).I've come close to death on a couple occasions and it's been a thrill so far. Other guildies are also trying and one died at lvl 32. It's straining but so much fun. Go try it yourself!</div></div><hr />

But a class like Hunters shouldn't have been allowed. Gear or not a hunter will just have his pet to do all his work, and never have to worry about mobs touching him. It kind of defeats the &quot;disqualify on death&quot; thing. Before anyone says this. I'm not jealous, I have no care for this type of thing. lol<br />

The official rules of the ironman challenge don't state that: see wowironman.com/rules some impose it as an extra rule, particularly on EU realms but it's not required. Also remember, this is a PERSONAL challenge. You can do it however you want, though there is a tracker that will check your armory and stats for compliance to most of the rules.<br />

really guys, all you who say &quot;lol hunter, easy mode&quot; just go try it yourself. It's not as easy as it sounds, remember: Only greys/whites, no talents, no pet talents, not even specialisation. No buffs from food or flasks, no potions/ elixirs, no professions and no deaths whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

Especially in the amount of time Krip did coz this challenge is really gruelling and puts a lot of strain on you. You have to be focussed all the time. And yes hunters have an advantage with being a ranged class and tracking. A pet is a nice side benefit but don't trust too much on that as they are quite squishy without all the nice gear stats.I'm leveling an ironman character now and at lvl 24 I'm enjoying the pace. The only challenger is myself and I don't mind ladders. Just like Krip I rolled a hunter coz it's the onlyy class I know how to play really well. Why would you cripple yourself even more by playing another class you don't know? This challenge is hard enough already.Came close to dying a couple of times. Pulling 3 mobs at lvl 17 is insane. Only at lvl 32 you get feign death.Go try yourself and let Krip have the credit for this, he earned it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't strike you as ironic that you knew immediately who he was talking about and then complained that he didn't get enough attention?<br />
<br />
Gutrot used talents and he died, many times. His challenge was being able to kill anything before it killed him, a very different challenge than the ironman one. You can test yourself how tough the ironman challenge is: get white gear from a vendor, unspec your talents and try to kill green+ mobs. Then imagine doing that from level 1-85.</div></div><hr />

This notion of OMG HUNTER LOL, it's not just hunters, guys. <br />
<br />
- Mages using Frostbolt, CoC, Nova, Frost Armor, Ice Lance, etcetc. Mages would be relatively easy.<br />
- Warlocks have pets, too.<br />
- Paladins have bubble, a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot;, more or less, for those looking at FD.<br />
- Rogues could cloak / vanish if in danger.<br />
<br />
I could go on and on. Stop stripping away his achievement.<br />
<br />
heres why your wrong:<br />
- mages get alot of their cc and utility from talent points<br />
- warlocks dont have fiegn death and their pets are generally not as strong as hunter ones.<br />
- Paladin bubble does not get you out of combat, and is on a 5 minute cooldown.<br />
- Rogues do not have a pet</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2012-03-03, 03:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem is that the Ironman rules are not ´difficult´ they are just tedious if you are a hunter. If you are green questing (doing quests 2-3 levels below your level), mobs are not going to kill your pet even if it is untalented and gets no stat points from you. You can test this in 5 minutes. Respec your hunter, don´t take any talents, remove your gear fly to twilight highlands and send your pet on a lvl 83 mob. You don´t even have to do anything.. your pet will still finish off the mobs. Yes, it will take awhile and you may have to heal it... but that is just tedium. If your pet dies? feign and pull again.<br />
<br />
Now do the same thing as a warrior, mage or rogue. It is infinitely more difficult to kill a lvl 83 mob as any other class. If you are any other class except hunter, each pull is a real chance to die.. if you are a hunter, there is only a very small chance to die.<br />
<br />
Seriously, test is on some of your toons. It is easy to verify. untalent, grab some white vendor trash, and kill a few lvl 83 mobs. You will see how different it is for other classes. You can´t even compare warlocks, because only big blue would survive more than a few seconds, and he doesn´t have the offense to kill anything.. so you would be health funneling him, but he wouldn´t be killing anything.<br />

Oddly enough, the ulduar drakes are still available as part of the achievement even to this day. Later, the ToGC Tribute mounts were removed (in 4.2 I believe.. could be wrong about that, although I do remember them removing the original ZG mounts as well and replaced them with half-hearted recolors.)<br />
<br />
My point is, the whole &quot;nod to the effort that went into achieving the task&quot; and &quot;isn't it a good thing that some things can stay rare,&quot; is so subjectively biased on their part that it's really not even worth mentioning as an excuse. What about the people who worked hard for the Ulduar mounts when it was current content? Didn't they deserve the same level of rarity with their mounts?<br />
<br />
Either remove the Glory mounts systematically when the next tier is released, or don't remove them at all. If they're removed as a part of a pattern, people know when to expect their removal and therefore it's not a surprise (or shouldn't be, at least.) Or conversely, if the main intention is for everyone to &quot;have a chance&quot; at getting the mount regardless of when it was introduced, don't remove any of them ever. Flip-flopping is bad.</div></div><hr />

Sure there are people who have gotten the mount after classic, even after Wotlk got released. But that does not mean its not rare....<br />
<br />
There is probably alot for you to learn about Scarab Lord. First off, ye DKs have it, they also had to start on a new server where AQ gate was closed, so they could open it to recieve the quest. Its still rare, even tho it was optainable. Saying Scarab Lord is not rare is like saying Bronze Drake is rare.</div></div><hr />

Oh and all you got is CLAIMS that you could do it better hurr durr, but in the end you &quot;go outside&quot; instead of doing so...<br />
<br />
That shows me nothing more than someone who apparently CAN'T do it, but he only claims so. I rest my case...<br />
<br />
Why would I waste my time killing green mobs to 85? It's stupid. He should have saved his time and hit the gym. PS I'm a legendary player in WoW back when the game was actually good. I can do anything I put my mind to. I rest MY case. LOL. EAT IT.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kripparrian</div><div class="date">2012-03-03, 09:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not to knock his accomplishment but he didn't even follow the rules of the challenge. Everything was supposed to be randomly selected. He picked a hunter because he was used to it. Rolling dice was literally how it was supposed to be picked and he didn't do it. In my books, he's just the first person to reach 85 without dying without using any gear. He's not an ironman champ.<br />
<br />
I dont know if this was a rule originally, but when I picked up the challenge it was not -- and still isnt now.<br />
I tried to follow all the rules to the tee, as well as some of my own on top. The majority of the rules can be enforced by checking the statistics tab. wowironman.com performs this checking service quite well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually the rules are quite clear about how everything down to the race, gender, and faction are randomized. Every single thing about it is supposed to be random otherwise everyone would pick a hunter, mage (frost) or lock to get a pet. The only things you have a choice over is how the randomly picked toon looks and the server you play on although there is an &quot;unofficial&quot; server they are playing on. If you want to give him/her blue hair and its available to that race then so be it. Try reading the rules again since you obviously aren't aware of the rules you say you've read.<br />
<br />
<br />
*edit<br />
I do appologize but when the rules first came out it was listed on there everything was random but apparently THAT has been changed in what is now the latest set of rules.</div></div><hr />

This just in: someone does something impressive, others deny him credit. Nothing to see here people, move along. <br />
<br />
This notion of OMG HUNTER LOL, it's not just hunters, guys. <br />
<br />
- Mages using Frostbolt, CoC, Nova, Frost Armor, Ice Lance, etcetc. Mages would be relatively easy.<br />
- Warlocks have pets, too.<br />
- Paladins have bubble, a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot;, more or less, for those looking at FD.<br />
- Rogues could cloak / vanish if in danger.<br />
<br />
I could go on and on. Stop stripping away his achievement.<br />
<br />
You forget, that you dont have any talent points - no mage pet, no CoC &quot;nova&quot; and so on...<br />

Grats on being BM. I'm pretty sure he must have given his feign death key a workout too. Now let's see a class that doesn't do the work for you finish this challenge, because it's not a challenge if your pet is going to do 90% of the work.<br />
<br />
Quite funny, that you have no clue, just ask Krip - his Pet got kinda two or three shottet, once he entered WotLk/Cata ;-)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icedwarrior</div><div class="date">2012-03-03, 11:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You forget, that you dont have any talent points - no mage pet, no CoC &quot;nova&quot; and so on...<br />
<br />
I most certainly didn't forget; that's why I didn't list CoC root, WE, &quot;and so on&quot;. I only listed the default things that mages get that would fall into the rules. <br />
<br />
<br />
heres why your wrong:<br />
- mages get alot of their cc and utility from talent points<br />
- warlocks dont have fiegn death and their pets are generally not as strong as hunter ones.<br />
- Paladin bubble does not get you out of combat, and is on a 5 minute cooldown.<br />
- Rogues do not have a pet<br />
<br />
Here's why I'm not:<br />
- And they still can utilize all the different CC / Utility that I listed.<br />
- I never said they did. The fact remains that they have pets, that they can control ( which means less hits on the warlock), and they can funnel life / drain life. Boring and slow, but it's got to be stupidly effective.<br />
- I never said it put you out of combat, but it does provide 8 seconds of immunity, often enough time to heal to full, HoJ and successfully reset (1v1), etc.<br />
- When did I say rogues have a pet? I was using it as an example of a &quot;get out of jail free card&quot;. I'm going to die? Cloak + Vanish = I didn't die.<br />
<br />
As stated by many people, the pets don't have talents, etc. Remember, they scale with the hunter, so they're going to be hitting like a wet noodle, have poor health, etc. Again, hunters are hands-down the &quot;easiest&quot; class to do, but by no means is this an easy feat. Stop being jealous and simply give credit where credit is due.</div></div><hr />

$20 says all the nay-sayers haven't grasped the rules of this challenge. I'm getting annoyed having to respond to all of them. Good luck fighting mobs when you're in level 84 zones with what, less than 20k health and ONLY GREY ITEMS, WITH NO TALENTS AND SPECIALIZATIONS, not to mention other hampering rules? Give me a break. <br />
<br />
Then again, these are most likely the same people the complain about Blizzard doing something, not doing something, and other myriads of illogical things that I don't care to go into right now.</div></div><hr />

He was never in an 84 zone. He started Hyjal at 83. As for other classes it would be impossible other than warlock just because of life tap, drain life and health funnel.<br />
<br />
Mages - A lot of their CC comes from talents. Think of a mage not even going frost, all you have is cone of cold, very ineffective frostbolt with a very long cast time, and just base mana. You would go oom before killing a mob once you get to around 75+.<br />
<br />
Paladins - Just awful damage if you aren't ret, you wouldn't be able to heal for more health than you got hit and if you did you would go oom so quick you would just be white hitting.<br />
<br />
Warriors - The definition of a gear dependent class, you get hit like a truck and can't hit for anything so you cannot generate rage plus you have no healing abilities until enraged regen but by the time you would reach the level to train it you would have most certainly died at least once<br />
<br />
Rogues - even with gear rogues are squishy, without gear and abilities aren't static but scale based of AP you have no chance of killing anything quick enough before it kills you<br />
<br />
Shaman - See paladin<br />
<br />
Priest - Are you really going to smite them to death? You will go oom after 5 smites or so around 60+ with no gear and wouldn't have any mana to heal yourself<br />
<br />
Druid - trying to level as a caster would force you to go oom too quick. Now if you tried to level in a form, cat form would be ineffective you just couldn't put out the damage without feral talents and such a low amount of armor and health. Bear form wouldn't be very useful because the armor you gain from bear form is scaled from your current armor, you wouldn't do any damage and still get hit like a truck.<br />
<br />
And for people calling other people jealous, why on earth would someone be jealous of a feat like this? Can one simply just not state that the person took the easy way out. A hunter, whether you like it or not, has a major advantage of every class.<br />
<br />
Hunters - They use focus for their abilities which is a major advantage to using rage, energy, or mana. Rage would be too hard to gain due to lack of your damage output, Energy regenerates ate a fairly quick rate but not as quickly as you can with focus using steady shot. Mana is just a huge joke and has the worst regen, the only thing that comes close is a warlock with life tap but it costs a good amount of health when you already have little to begin with not to mention you gimp your damage by using drain life, unlike a hunter where steady shot is used as a normal rotation ability.<br />
<br />
They also have feign death, which I know rogues have vanish and night elves have shadowmeld and mages have invisibility but most likely a mage wouldn't reach 78 before dying and FD is on a much shorter CD than the rest of these abilities.<br />
<br />
Pet for a hunter is also a huge advantage. Like I said yes warlocks have pets as well, but using life tap with such low health to begin with and having to drain life would be too slow and wouldn't generate enough health without being talented into it which you can't use talents. Not only that their ability to heal their pet as well takes life from them when a hunters heal is a HoT and costs no focus.<br />
<br />
People aren't saying this challenge was easy, but the fact that hunter was the easiest class to do it with and had major advantages over every other class. If you really read people's posts out of context that bad where you think they are just calling it easy, you need to go back to english class in school.</div></div><hr />

Regardless, this should not be on the front page, imo.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">icedwarrior</div><div class="date">2012-03-04, 03:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">He was never in an 84 zone.

<br />
Impossible? Yeah, okay. /sarcasm. Difficult? Sure, but not impossible. <br />
<br />
<br />
Mages - A lot of their CC comes from talents. Think of a mage not even going frost, all you have is cone of cold, very ineffective frostbolt with a very long cast time, and just base mana. You would go oom before killing a mob once you get to around 75+.<br />
<br />
Okay, so since people are completely ignoring my point -- that mages have a lot of base cc / control / utility -- let's list out what they have, THAT IS ALLOWED for the challenge:<br />
<br />
- Frostbolt at level 7.<br />
- Frost Nova at level 8.<br />
- Counterspell at level 9.<br />
- Evocation (glyph isn't allowed, but still regens mana) at level 12.<br />
- Polymorph at level 14.<br />
- Blink at level 16.<br />
- Cone of Cold at level 18.<br />
- Ice Block at level 30.<br />
- Remove Curse at level 30.<br />
- Slow Fall at level 32.<br />
- Mage Ward at level 36.<br />
- Mana Shield at level 46.<br />
- Conjure Maga Gem at level 48.<br />
- Mirror Image at level 50.<br />
- Frost Armor at level 54.<br />
- Mage Armor at level 68.<br />
- Spellsteal at level 70.<br />
- Invisibility at level 78.<br />
- Ring of Frost at level 83.<br />
<br />
All of these are learned via leveling, and have no bearing on talents, glyphs, etc. But you're right, they only have two abilities that they can use. Oh, wait...<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins - Just awful damage if you aren't ret, you wouldn't be able to heal for more health than you got hit and if you did you would go oom so quick you would just be white hitting.<br />
<br />
I definitely agree with you here, I couldn't imagine leveling a Paladin in this challenge. But my point is that if they need an OH SHIT! button, they have bubble, effectively resetting the fight, be it healing, HoJ and running out to evade the mod, etc. Obviously FD is better, but the point is it's there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warriors - The definition of a gear dependent class, you get hit like a truck and can't hit for anything so you cannot generate rage plus you have no healing abilities until enraged regen but by the time you would reach the level to train it you would have most certainly died at least once<br />
<br />
Definitely the most gear-dependent class, but I remember a certain fury (?) warrior who had self-imposed a &quot;similar&quot; challenge, in which he could only use certain weapons and the like. My memory's hazy on this, because it was a while, but I remember it being pretty impressive.<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogues - even with gear rogues are squishy, without gear and abilities aren't static but scale based of AP you have no chance of killing anything quick enough before it kills you<br />
<br />
No chance of killing anything, eh? Yeah, you're totally not exaggerating. They're squishy, sure, but they have, oh, let's see:<br />
<br />
- Evasion<br />
- Recuperate<br />
- Kick<br />
- Gouge <br />
- Sprint<br />
- Vanish<br />
- Kidney Shot<br />
- Blind<br />
- Dismantle<br />
- Cheap Shot<br />
- Garrote<br />
- Safe Fall<br />
- Cloak of Shadows<br />
- Combat Readiness<br />
<br />
They have a *few* tools at their disposal, and whenever something goes wrong, vanish, gg.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman - See paladin<br />
<br />
I couldn't imagine doing this as enhancement and/or restoration, but I could see elemental being a &quot;maybe&quot;. Frost Shock, Earthbind Totem, etc. They have a shot. Hard? Sure. But they have a shot.<br />
<br />
<br />
Priest - Are you really going to smite them to death? You will go oom after 5 smites or so around 60+ with no gear and wouldn't have any mana to heal yourself<br />
<br />
Yeah, this would be tough. Very tough. They could, uhh, mind flay? A lot of their good abilities come from talents, so...<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid - trying to level as a caster would force you to go oom too quick. Now if you tried to level in a form, cat form would be ineffective you just couldn't put out the damage without feral talents and such a low amount of armor and health. Bear form wouldn't be very useful because the armor you gain from bear form is scaled from your current armor, you wouldn't do any damage and still get hit like a truck.<br />
<br />
You certainly make a good point about bears, but with entangling roots, I think that a &quot;boomkin&quot; (yes, they can't talent, just saying a caster druid) could be plausible. I may be wrong, because I've never, ever played a boomkin, but I would think it would be possible. In terms of kitty, I would think they could pull it off. Painful, but possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for people calling other people jealous, why on earth would someone be jealous of a feat like this? Can one simply just not state that the person took the easy way out. A hunter, whether you like it or not, has a major advantage of every class.<br />
<br />
That's the only thing I can conceivably think of as to why someone -- let alone this many people -- discredit what he's done. Did he pick the &quot;easiest&quot; class to do so? Sure, I don't think any of us are saying that. But I see so many &quot;lol front page gg mmo-champ&quot; posts, it's just disgusting. <br />
<br />
<br />
Hunters - They use focus for their abilities which is a major advantage to using rage, energy, or mana. Rage would be too hard to gain due to lack of your damage output, Energy regenerates ate a fairly quick rate but not as quickly as you can with focus using steady shot. Mana is just a huge joke and has the worst regen, the only thing that comes close is a warlock with life tap but it costs a good amount of health when you already have little to begin with not to mention you gimp your damage by using drain life, unlike a hunter where steady shot is used as a normal rotation ability.<br />
<br />
They also have feign death, which I know rogues have vanish and night elves have shadowmeld and mages have invisibility but most likely a mage wouldn't reach 78 before dying and FD is on a much shorter CD than the rest of these abilities.<br />
<br />
Pet for a hunter is also a huge advantage. Like I said yes warlocks have pets as well, but using life tap with such low health to begin with and having to drain life would be too slow and wouldn't generate enough health without being talented into it which you can't use talents. Not only that their ability to heal their pet as well takes life from them when a hunters heal is a HoT and costs no focus.<br />
<br />
As I've previously stated, hunters are in the best shape for this, so no point commenting here.<br />
<br />
<br />
People aren't saying this challenge was easy, but the fact that hunter was the easiest class to do it with and had major advantages over every other class. <br />
<br />
Okay. <br />
<br />
<br />
Gear or not a hunter will just have his pet to do all his work, and never have to worry about mobs touching him.<br />
<br />
<br />
Its funny, Hunter and DK are the only classes my 4 year old can play reasonably too lol<br />
<br />
<br />
That sort of makes the point to &quot;not die&quot; null when you have a pet to die for you.<br />
<br />
<br />
regardless of playing a hunter using that much time on a game is a little sad.<br />
<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned doing the Ironman Challenge as a hunter it not really doing the same achievement as everyone else. The hunter's pet is an asset that makes things so much easier compared to what the rest of the classes dispose of. Anyway, he doesn't deserve a post on the main page and even less an interview. <br />
<br />
<br />
Getting 0 deaths in WoW is hardly hard.I recently started playing GW and they have this sort of achievement for real. Multiple levels of it too. Between the lag, the actually hard-hitting mobs, no-gimmicky things like flying and the RPG mechanics of it all... it is actually quite a challenge. Don't mean to knock this guy but this is a joke. Levelling to 60 or even 70 without any deaths is impressive. Nowadays? LOL.<br />
As others have also pointed out: Hunter. This *has* to be a joke right?<br />
<br />
These are just five quotes from the first and second page. People are so misinformed, illogical, ignorant, and flaming it's appalling. You've even gone so far as to criticize someone because they've devoted their time to a video game, which is even more hilarious coming from someone that has 557 posts on an online forum. Tell me, what's the difference? You've spent some time online, and so has he. Hypocrit much?<br />
<br />
<br />
If you really read people's posts out of context that bad where you think they are just calling it easy, you need to go back to english class in school.<br />

- Ring of Frost at level 83.<br />
<br />
All of these are learned via leveling, and have no bearing on talents, glyphs, etc. But you're right, they only have two abilities that they can use. Oh, wait..<br />
As I said it isn't just about the lack of useful CC but about the mana problem you have due to not being able to wear gear with stats on it. You won't have extra range or the slowing percentage of frost bolt, so how do you expect to keep kiting when the slow doesn't last that long, it doesn't slow them down that much, and you have to cast a full 2 seconds every frost bolt. You do not have cold snap to reset these abilities either and they are on a pretty decent cooldown. Unless you are planning to use evocate on every single mob pulled you are going to have a rough time even making it to 60. You are going to get hit like a truck and have no chance of making it to even 75 let alone 85.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I definitely agree with you here, I couldn't imagine leveling a Paladin in this challenge. But my point is that if they need an OH SHIT! button, they have bubble, effectively resetting the fight, be it healing, HoJ and running out to evade the mod, etc. Obviously FD is better, but the point is it's there.<br />
Just because you have an oh shit button doesn't mean you are guarenteed not to die.<br />
<br />
<br />
Definitely the most gear-dependent class, but I remember a certain fury (?) warrior who had self-imposed a &quot;similar&quot; challenge, in which he could only use certain weapons and the like. My memory's hazy on this, because it was a while, but I remember it being pretty impressive. Regardless of weapons you don't have the healing and damage output necessary to kill a mob past level 40.<br />
<br />
<br />
No chance of killing anything, eh? Yeah, you're totally not exaggerating. They're squishy, sure, but they have, oh, let's see:<br />
<br />
- Evasion<br />
- Recuperate<br />
- Kick<br />
- Gouge <br />
- Sprint<br />
- Vanish<br />
- Kidney Shot<br />
- Blind<br />
- Dismantle<br />
- Cheap Shot<br />
- Garrote<br />
- Safe Fall<br />
- Cloak of Shadows<br />
- Combat Readiness<br />
<br />
They have a *few* tools at their disposal, and whenever something goes wrong, vanish, gg. <br />
I understand they have all of these cooldowns but with lack of gear at level 70+ how much damage can you pump out with white weapons? 20% of their health? Then you pop evasion thats another what maybe 30 to 40% health, you still have 40 to 50% of their health to burn through before you die. Rogues have no chance even with their arsenal of survivability cooldowns.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I couldn't imagine doing this as enhancement and/or restoration, but I could see elemental being a &quot;maybe&quot;. Frost Shock, Earthbind Totem, etc. They have a shot. Hard? Sure. But they have a shot. <br />
Once again you underestimate how much mana you burn through without gear, go out and play a high level caster naked untalented and tell me how it goes as far as mana problems.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, this would be tough. Very tough. They could, uhh, mind flay? A lot of their good abilities come from talents, so...<br />
Mind Flay is a shadow talent, all you have is smite and once again mana comes into play and you don't have the damage output to kill a mob past 50+<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You certainly make a good point about bears, but with entangling roots, I think that a &quot;boomkin&quot; (yes, they can't talent, just saying a caster druid) could be plausible. I may be wrong, because I've never, ever played a boomkin, but I would think it would be possible. In terms of kitty, I would think they could pull it off. Painful, but possible.<br />
Entangling roots has diminishing returns, with no gear killing a mob in 3 entangling roots is not plausible, and even using cooldowns your mana gets depleted and you get hit way too hard.<br />
<br />
<br />
And to top it off, you end it by insulting my intelligence. Kudos. Did my &quot;wall of text&quot; pass your English class?<br />
That line wasn't directed at you but you seem angry about it.<br />
<br />
What you have trouble factoring in is everything. You have clearly never played a near naked character at a high level with NO talents. Talents in cata are what make or break every class and give that boost to kill things. Other than a hunter and warlock there is near no way for any of the other classes to complete this challenge. I'm sure it is possible but I want to say around a .001% chance of it happening and would take immense amounts of effort and time and strategy to pull something like that off.<br />

Look at that chart, the closest people have gotten that are not a warlock or hunter is a druid at 66 (once he gets to northrend it will be game over for him), paladin and rogue at 64 (again once they hit northrend is where it separates the men from the boys). The highest mage is level 43.</div></div><hr />

According to wowhead, Frostbolt has a base 35 yard range, 40% snare for 9 seconds, 2 second cast time, all untalented. I will concede the fact that I have never attempted to play untalented, grey gear, and any / all of the Ironman rules, so yes, I don't know the mana issues. That said, I see Ice Lance is 6% base, I would think with proper abuse of Frost Nova and kiting with Frostbolt / CoC, it is possible. Timers on CDs are irrelevant; unless you're aiming for world first (which has obviously been done already), what does it matter if the challenge took 5 years? It would be plausible to wait 10 minutes per pull, so long as you achieve the ultimate goal. But, of course, this would just be further ammunition for people to bitch about, and would invalidate the achievement. Somehow. You won't be getting &quot;hit like a truck&quot; if you can successfully kite, but again I have not attempted the Iron Man Challenge. I am merely suggesting that it is possible. <br />

When you're only addressing me, I would have thought it was safe to assume that it was addressed to me, but I guess I'm wrong. Regardless if you're referencing me, or John Smith, insulting someone to get your point across doesn't strengthen your argument. It's an ad hominem attack.<br />

Of course I haven't; I'm currently unsubscribed, and I never had the thought &quot;You know what would be fun? Level 1-85 with no deaths, talents, gear, etc&quot;. It is a fun idea, and something I would actively pursue if I was. I simply don't have the time anymore to do so, nor do I have the money. I still maintain that mages would be viable candidates.<br />

Of course not many mages have reached that far, because only 7.6% of the Iron Man Challenge are mages. Compare that to, say, Paladins, which are amazingly almost double the amount. For some reason. <br />

<br />
<br />
then in all honesty youre not that good at questing<br />
<br />
i can do 1-85 without raf in under 2 days played easily(and have multiple times)<br />
<br />
dungeons are awful for pure leveling speed <br />
<br />
and ive had a few friends beat me by ridiculous amounts(like 5+ hours) without raf so im not even that great.<br />
<br />
edit:<br />
this is the only ss i have because my harddrive randomly died but ive had better times:<br />
<br />
http://i.imgur.com/BrVDy.png<br />
<br />
<br />
i reaaly dont even like warlock that much at leveling. after leveling every class multiple times during cataclysm 1-85 druids are definitely the fastest.<br />
<br />
<br />
fuck i really wish they would lift the character per server limit. i really want to reactivate to see how fast i can do 1-85 after practicing a lot but fuck 10 chars per server :(<br />
<br />
also that was pre 70-80 nerf, the most recent nerf.<br />
<br />
im pretty confident that it is possible to do 1-85 in 1 day 5-10 hours or less without raf now.</div></div><hr />

I just love people like you: &quot;I'm currently unsubscribed, have never done this so i can't talk from personal experience, but please take me seriously as i make a serious suggestion which i will base only on pure speculation and guesswork.&quot;<br />
Yeah. That's. Nice. To say the least. Thank you for that completely useful input on your part. Lemme just get through some points in your post. The thing that you obviously fail to understand is the reliance of a mage class on it's talents and gear. Every spell has a base mana cost, and with no stats on gear that's actually flat mana cost considering the fact that base = actual mana with no gear on. The cost of 1 frostbolt is 13% of that mana. The cost of icelance is 6%. If those two numbers alone aren't enough for you to get a clear picture of things then let me illustrate it for your convenience. <br />
<br />
You will not kill a mob over level 30 with 3 frostbolts, or 4, or 5, or 6, or 7 etc. With base frostbolt damage, you will need 10+ frostbolts (on average, including crits) to down a mob. How much is 13%x10? I leave that to you to figure it out. <br />
Now let's take icelance into consideration. Icelance costs 2x less than frostbolt, but does half it's damage unless the target is frozen. So, unless the target is frozen, cost to damage ratio of icelance is almost identical to frostbolt. When is the target frozen? Specless mage can only use Frost Nova to freeze enemies. It's a spell with 25sec cooldown and 7% mana cost. So depending on your luck, you may fire off up to 3 icelances on a frozen target before the frost effect breaks which will save up to 3x7% (the difference in cost of 3frostbolts vs 3icelances) - 7% (the cost of Frost Nova) of mana. Which still ends up at more than your entire mana pool for just one mob. Can you grasp now the severity of leveling a mage this way? And this is only on level 30. As you continue progressing, mobs health increases rapidly while base damage of your skills is only slightly enhanced. At certain point, your entire mana pool + evo won't be enough to down even 1 mob. That's where your journey ends. As far as combat is concerned. You could still do dailies if you manage to get to zones that have them, but you won't. So, effectively, finishing the ironman challenge with a mage is impossible. There are no buts and maybes and &quot;it will just take 5years!&quot;, it's simply not possible.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fair enough. As I've said, I haven't considered mana cost, I've been thinking about the abilities and what not. I would, however, like to point out that mages have abilities such as Evocation and Conjure Mana Gem, things that would help in this department. But whatever, it's impossible. <br />
<br />
Regardless, I'm over this conversation. It's pointless when the other side won't entertain anything, and we're not giving credit to Kripp, which this thread should be about. So I'll say it again, kudos Kripp.</div></div><hr />

First: That ladder is fairly new and came long after the release of Cataclysm. IMO the players who completed the Ironman Challenge before the ladder was even avaliable still count.<br />
Second: The software used for the ladder is still buggy. It disqualified many players (me included) for no valid reasons.<br />

Not to belittle what he did, but there has to be an easiest and hardest class to play. The rules dont mandate what class to play, only what to do and what not to do and attempt to win.<br />
<br />
If hunters are are the &quot;best&quot; class why didn't other hunters beat him or why we dont see tons of hunters finishing 2nd, 3rd, 4th or 5th etc? Look at the link I provide, A TON of players are playing a hunter and are 1+ levels behind him.. He obviously put in the most time, effort and had the most skill to finish the challenge. <br />
<br />
So, regardless GRATS TO HIM.<br />
