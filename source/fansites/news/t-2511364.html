https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/june/mvbar900.jpg<br />
<br />
Starting the Grind<br />
In order to even be able to start the reputation grind for the mount, players must have acquired either Bumbles (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/143730-bumbles) (aquired from the Let's Bee Friends (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/13062-lets-bee-friends) achievement) or Seabreeze Bumblebee (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/143176-seabreeze-bumblebee) (purchasable at revered with Storm's Wake).<br />
<br />
<br />
For those looking to get Bumbles (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/143730-bumbles), you must complete the quest chain that starts with Mayhem at Mildenhall Meadery (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/50343-mayhem-at-mildenhall-meadery) first.<br />
Once the chain is completed, you can farm for Annealed Honey Amulet (https://www.wowdb.com/items/163699-annealed-honey-amulet), which is a drop from either certain bees or honey elementals in Stormsong Valley.<br />
Once you acquire the Annealed Honey Amulet (https://www.wowdb.com/items/163699-annealed-honey-amulet), you must then find Rosaline Mildenhall in Boralus (she has multiple spawn points) and speak to her to receive Rosaline's Letter (https://www.wowdb.com/items/163702-rosalines-letter).<br />
Upon returning to Mildenhall Meadery, you can obtain the quest Bumbles the Bee (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53347-bumbles-the-bee) from Ancel Mildenhall (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/131793-ancel-mildenhall).<br />
This opens up the daily quest Let's Bee Friends (https://www.wowdb.com/quests/53371-lets-bee-friends) that must be completed 7 times to receive the achievement and the pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
Summoning either of these pets around Barry the Beekeeper (https://www.wowdb.com/npcs/153393-barry-the-beekeeper), an npc found near the Mildrenhall Meadery flight path, will cause him to talk about a new hive in the area. Your bee pet will discover a green aroma pool nearby. If you head north and follow these green pools you will eventually find the Honeyback Hive (waypoint is 62, 26).<br />
<br />
Barry will stop the Hivemother from attacking you (though if you enter the hive now you will be teleported out and become poisoned). He suggests you calm her with some jelly. There is a Thin Jelly (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168822-thin-jelly) nearby at waypoint 63, 28. Offering this to the queen does nothing and Barry is forced to communicate to her through dance, eventually granting you access to the hive.<br />
<br />
Inside you will find a Nascent Harvester, a small larva on the honeycombs on the left side of the cave. This is the most important part of the grind as this harvester is who you must raise into your mount!<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/thumb/hive.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/hive.jpg)<br />
<br />
How to Gain Reputation and Get the Mount<br />
The Nascent Harvester has a friendship bar when you interact with it that starts at 0/3000. Filling this bar involves feeding the Harvester jellies that you can find all over Stormsong Valley. They are obtained from nodes called Jelly Deposits which look like single or triple honey combs on the ground or clinging to walls and trees. After filling the bar to 3000/3000, the Nascent Harvester becomes a Juvenile Harvester with a friendship bar of 0/7000. Filling this turns it into a Mature Harvester and finishes his friendship bar.<br />
<br />
Upon first unlocking the hive you also get the Honeyback Hive as a typical reputation in your reputation tab. (Note: This reputation DOES NOT count for 100 Exalted Reputations (https://www.wowdb.com/achievements/12866-100-exalted-reputations) achievement) You must raise this faction to exalted while also completing both of the Harvester's friendship bars to receive the mount.<br />
<br />
Ways to Earn Reputation<br />
<br />
Main Source - Jelly Deposits around Stormsong Valley<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/thumb/deposit01.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/deposit01.jpg) https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/thumb/deposit02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/september/deposit02.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Note - Turning your ground clutter graphic settings to 1 greatly increases your ability to see these nodes.<br />
Neutral to Honored - Contain usually 1 Thin Jelly (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168822-thin-jelly)<br />
Honored to Revered - Can contain multiple Thin Jelly (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168822-thin-jelly) and sometimes Rich Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168825-rich-jelly)<br />
Revered to Exalted - Can contain multiple Thin Jelly (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168822-thin-jelly) and sometimes Rich Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168825-rich-jelly) or even Royal Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168828-royal-jelly), and VERY RARELY Crystallized Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169133-crystallized-jelly), which contains a small amount of all of these jellies. You can also rarely obtain Jelly Magnet (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169110-jelly-magnet) which provides a 30 minute buff that can increase the amount of jelly you harvest from nodes.<br />
<br />
Thin Jelly (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168822-thin-jelly) - 20 reputation and 5 friendship when given to Harvester.<br />
Rich Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168825-rich-jelly) - 80 Reputation and 20 friendship when given to Harvester.<br />
Royal Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168828-royal-jelly) - 160 Reputation and 40 friendshup when given to Harvester.<br />
<br />
You can exchange these jellies with the Honeyback Hivemother to receive the upgraded rarity or downgrade to the lesser rarity.<br />
<br />
4 Thin Jelly (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168822-thin-jelly) can be exchanged for 1 Rich Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168825-rich-jelly).<br />
8 Thin Jelly (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168822-thin-jelly) can be exchanged for 1 Royal Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168828-royal-jelly).<br />
1 Royal Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168828-royal-jelly) can be exchanged for 8 Thin Jelly (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168822-thin-jelly).<br />
<br />
Can also contain various hats and cosmetics for your bee pets.<br />
<br />
Honey Smasher Elite Rare<br />
<br />
Ettin rare located on the beach north of the hive. Has a short respawn timer.<br />
Can be killed for rewards once per day<br />
Killing him provides 500 reputation with the Honeyback Hive and a chance for jellies.<br />
Has a chance to drop one of the new butterfly pets<br />
Can also drop Jelly Magnet (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169110-jelly-magnet)<br />
<br />
Beevents! (Bee Events)<br />
<br />
Every so often around the map (noted by a star) you can find a Honeyback Harvester over a flower bed with a light to the sky.<br />
Interacting with this harvester initiates a 5 minute event in which waves of adds spawn that get progressively harder as the event goes on.<br />
The mobs gain a stack of Jelly Aggression (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/301465-jelly-aggression) every wave.<br />
There is a chance for a rare mob to spawn at the 5 and 10 stack mark. It seems to be guaranteed at the 15 stack mark.<br />
<br />
These rares each provide a unique blue item drop that can be turned in once (could be weekly, needs reset to confirm) for 750 reputation with the Honeyback Hive.<br />
<br />
Note - When the event ends, all mobs will become unable to be attacked and leave. This includes the rare mobs so the more dps the better! Most people tend to shout the location of the event in general and wait for the masses to arrive before activating it.<br />
Once the event ends, a jelly deposit will appear on the ground that contains increasingly better amounts of jellies for how far you managed to stack the Jelly Aggression (https://www.wowdb.com/spells/301465-jelly-aggression) buff.<br />
<br />
Beevents can be done multiple times a day.<br />
<br />
<br />
Benefits of Reaching Revered<br />
The grind becomes a lot more tolerable once you reach revered. Not only do the jelly deposits have a chance to contain higher rarity jellies, but you gain access to an item that significantly speeds up your deposit farming time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beeholder's Goggles (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169109-beeholders-goggles)<br />
<br />
Sold by Barry the Beekeeper right outside the Hive. Requires revered to purchase.<br />
Costs 20 Rich Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168825-rich-jelly) but is extremely worth it.<br />
These goggles have infinite uses on a 1 hour cooldown and provides a 1 hour buff that displays nearby jelly deposits on the mini map.<br />
<br />
The deposits show up on your map from very far away. You might think this is not worth the investment, but trust me it is!<br />
<br />
You can also buy the Alluring Bloom (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169862-alluring-bloom) from the Hivemother, but this isn't worth it provided you have flying.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Obtaining the Mount<br />
Once you reach exalted while also having filled the harvester's friendship bars (both the 3000 and 7000 bar after) the Mature Harvester will offer the Leaving the Hive quest that has you speak to Barry outside and obtain the Honeyback Harvester (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/170069-honeyback-harvesters-harness) mount! Congratulations! Your little bee is now your steadfast flying steed!<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous Information<br />
<br />
Jellies can be sold and purchased on the auction house.<br />
The Hivemother also sells Collected Tidebloom Honey (https://www.wowdb.com/items/172383-collected-tidebloom-honey) for 35 Royal Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168828-royal-jelly) at exalted, which provides a weekly quest for 850 reputation with the Storm's Wake.<br />
The Hivemother also sells Alluring Bloom (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169862-alluring-bloom) for 5 Thin Jelly (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168822-thin-jelly) at friendly, which is consumed on use.<br />
Barry the Beekeeper sells Summit Zephyr (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169395-summit-zephyr) for 15 Thin Jelly (https://ptr.wowdb.com/items/168822-thin-jelly) at honored.<br />
Barry the Beekeeper also sells Butterfly Net (https://www.wowdb.com/items/169141-butterfly-net) for 25 Royal Jelly (https://www.wowdb.com/items/168828-royal-jelly) at exalted, which strangly is not a toy.</div></div><hr />

Yeah it is kind of crap that the Worgen/ Goblins did not get thier armor. EVEN so you would not have to grind them to lv 120 you would have to get them to exulted with Gilneas like with the Dwarfs Tauren Gnome ect....</div></div><hr />

Never was a fan of riding bugs (even if its one of the best ones).<br />
And lengthy (and boring!) mount grinding rep also doesn't help to get the motivation to acquire it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Started a bit yesterday, finishing today. And there is a social aspect about it too, general chat is buzzing of people who wants to bee friends.</div></div><hr />

I’m a horde player that has been waiting forever for the bee mount, and that is extremely upset that it’s faction gated. I would have happily did the faction rep grind on my alt alliance toon just for the mount. You know, much like Alliance players get to do for BOTH of our faction exclusive mounts that aren’t even unique. Oh and also, don’t y’all get a chance to ride every single one of our rep mounts via alternate skin? That’s why some of us are mad. It’s insulting.

Oh and also, don’t y’all get a chance to ride every single one of our rep mounts via alternate skin? That’s why some of us are mad. It’s insulting. Don’t bring your horses straw man argument either.<br />
<br />
Not a straw man it's a simple fact also assuming this stays alliance only the total mounts obtainable by each faction will again be balanced.</div></div><hr />

Even after I've gotten the mount myself I will grind some more to sell on the AH for some lil gold. Sell a couple of Seabreeze Bumbles as well. <br />
<br />
Started a bit yesterday, finishing today. And there is a social aspect about it too, general chat is buzzing of people who wants to bee friends.<br />
<br />
You already have it? Legendary :) I just got to Honored. I love this rep grind and how it makes you kind of act like a bee to get it. Plus its a great cooldown off the whole war thing, chilling with all the nice scenery out there.<br />
<br />
I wonder what other faction specific mounts they'll do later.</div></div><hr />

You people are truly amazing. You ALWAYS manage to find something to complain about. They didn't timegate rep this time? Let's complain about the fact that rep can be &quot;'farmed&quot; through AH, which is obviously done so ppl spend money on tokens.<br />
<br />
I mean, truly incredible, remarkable talent you got there. If only you could apply it to something other than being a complete retard.<br />
<br />
Also, laughing at all the horde tears, game is literally so horde-favored in every single aspect of the game that matters, and yet they cry because Alliance gets A MOUNT. Great, now if only it would help us get some more players, and maybe mythic azsharas...</div></div><hr />

Your faction is favoured every step on the way. It only took a week of getting ganked by alliance to be able to turn off warmode in every rested zone. Months of alliance getting zerged vs 1 week of horde whine.<br />

They can, yes. But it's either a &quot;magical rare drop&quot; or several tokens expensive. You get to have unique models by just farming rep, the bee was obviously introduced like this to make up for the many recycled horse/gryphon models the alliance got for rep mounts, whether you like that argument or not.</div></div><hr />

No, I went to sleep after work so lost 4 hours then we did some dungeons, but grinding as we speak:P Getting tired though, so I guess I have to forfeit and say that I will get it tomorrow instead.. ^^ Speed things up though grinding it in the night. Stormsong is so soothing as well, chill grind is nice. <br />

Alliance has gotten the bigger WM bonus for the better half of the expansion (by far), they get free gear from AAO, they get extra honor from BGs, their racials are now slightly better than the Horde ones for raiding, Shadowmeld dominated M+, you got a unique mount model in PvP S1 from BfA and now you get an exclussive mount while all the Horde ones are also useable by the Alliance, in addition to another rep to make the collection achievement easier.<br />
<br />
You're right, thank god the Alliance finally got something. Just try not to be biased for a millisecond, it'll do wonders.<br />
<br />
Note: This is not a complaint about the bee mount being Alliance exclussive, there's plenty of mounts in the game, it's pointless to whine about the 1 not obtainable. I just can't help myself when I see people pretend like Blizzard is so grossly biased towards one faction, while being completely blind to their own.</div></div><hr />

AOO got nerfed and is only useful for lazy alts if at all now.<br />
How are alliance racials better for raiding?<br />
Shadowmeld maybe dominated m+ tournaments because you can make preset characters. This shit is not replicated in live at all.<br />

That's what I'm doing. Park your alts at the spawn point of the daily rare and farm it overtime. No rush. No fuss. When you have collected enough to get to revered, buy the honey goggles and speed up the farm (if you want to wander around collecting the stuff). If not, just do the math and count how many jellies you need to befriend the bee and reach exalted with the hive. Save them for a human char, wait for a rep bonus event (like DMF) and turn everything in with 20% bonus.</div></div><hr />

No it’s not, since you can get that mount as a drop on your alliance toons if you want. No reskin for the bee for us.</div></div><hr />

You have to be really blind to miss the horde bias over all these years.<br />
<br />
Doesn't change the fact that you get extra gear, even if it is just easier t ogear up alts a bit faster. The fact that it even offered competitive rewards at one point is laughable.<br />
<br />
Racial = stronk = good for raiding? Not sure what's not to understand here. As I said, it's slightly, but they are better. It's due to the addition of allied races, as I'm sure you extrapollated.<br />
<br />
Doesn't change the fact that it's the top racial for M+? If it was a Horde race, this would 100% be used as a case for Horde bias.<br />
<br />
And yes, this gem of an image.<br />
<br />
1: Devs boo'd Alliance players?<br />
2: Counterpoint, Alliance gets better allied race and PvP mounts. Not to mention that all Horde mounts are available to Alliance either way. I agree that the 3 horses were bad but it's cherrypicking a specific situation to try and make a case for bias.<br />
3: The Alliance equivelant has been added. Alliance got their winterspring saber in vanilla, Horde didn't get an equivelant until WotLK. I genuinly don't see any problem here.<br />
4: As the end of the war campaign is now revealed, Anduin releasing Saurfang saved the war, albeit indirectly. If Anduin didn't release him, it meant no rebellion, no Thrall, no joint forces between Alliance/Horde and Sylvanas being more likely to succeed. Pretending like the second cinematic wasn't relevant for Alliance is sticking your head in the sand as it was a pivetal moment, in which Anduin played a huge role. Also, the Legion cinematic was a Varian monologue, where was the Horde counterpart back then?<br />
5: See above. I think this is a relatively fair point, even if it's presented poorly.<br />
6: The buff that has been stronger for Alliance now for much longer than it has been for Horde?<br />
7: Again, insanely poorly made point. Being on the launcher =/= getting paid and the reason the Alliance players were booted is because they were lagging out the zone, no such reports were made about the Boralus raid, IIRC. Streamers are on the launcher frequently, one of them just happened to be raiding an Alliance city. This is such a gross misrepresentation of the whole situation.<br />
8: Okay. Raiding has been uneven in the past, as has high end PvP. I agree that it's a problem, cross-faction raiding would solve the problem. Especially as raiding has gotten more complex, while the player pool has gotten smaller.<br />
9: Horde who gets their warchief shit on the faction, followed by the Alliance High King giving a speech in their capital.. There's plenty of moments that feel bad for both factions.<br />
10: Ah, something 100% subjective, great point.<br />
<br />
So basicly, your rep mounts were poor and player choice for Alliance players would be nice. You know, formulating it like this might actually get devs to pay attention to the request, instead of constantly misrepresenting things to try and make the situation look worse...</div></div><hr />

The only Horde exclusive mount from a questline is a reskinned direhorn. The formerly exclusive flying mount can be used by Alliance now but the bee isn't usable by Horde. It's incredibly unfair.</div></div><hr />
