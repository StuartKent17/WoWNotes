Artifact Power Adjustments from Islands Bug<br />
Last week, there was a bug active for approximately half an hour that resulted in a small number of players receiving an extreme amount of Artifact Power from completing Island Expeditions. While this error was on our end, the amount of Artifact Power given was far too high to leave as-is, as doing so would give an unfair advantage to the handful of players that happened to queue for Islands while this bug was active.<br />
<br />
To that end, we have been working to identify and isolate these incorrect Artifact Power gains and remove the additional amounts that should not have been given. Players who were affected by this bug will instead be granted the amount of Artifact Power that would have been correct for the Island Expeditions they completed. This action has now been taken, and affected players will notice their total amount of Artifact Power has been reduced.<br />
<br />
We apologize for the confusion and frustration this has caused, and remain committed to providing an equal and fair environment for our players.</div></div><hr />

Its almost like everyone just uses ptr to check new models and raids and then gtfo without even reporting bugs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno, I've seen lots of people who report bugs. I've even done it before, but very rarely. I think part of the problem is bugs not being specific enough to help fix the issue, or there not being enough reports of the issue for Blizzard to take it seriously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Uhhh no.<br />
<br />
There were a shit load of bug reports/concerns made during BFA alpha/beta that NEVER got resolved prior to launch.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no reason to think this is the fault of people volunteering their time to report bugs. It is not the player's job to find bugs. Anyone playing Beta's/PTRs is volunteering their time to find and report bugs as they occur.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, no. That's Blizz's job. I mean, if they don't even fix the problems and bugs that people DO submit...<br />
That's gotta be the stupidest attempt at defending Blizz I've read in a while. Congratulations.</div></div><hr />

They fixed the bug in less than an hour tho? A bug which did not appear on ptr.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm not a big fan of Blizzard these days, but really, there was NO reason to ban anyone. There was no way to avoid the bug by playing normally. You ban people that abuse faults in the game, sure, but if hearthing gave people the &quot;famed slayer&quot; title, would it be fair to ban them for using an integral part of the game?</div></div><hr />

I have been in some betas and of all the bugs I reported every single one made it into the release version months laters(even those that have been easy to solve but very annoying...like being sent to an alliance quest giver as a horde player). That's when I stopped reporting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is interesting that Blizzard decided not to punish anyone who benefited from this bug, even if people may have intentionally utilised it and gained an advantage might have been similar to that gained from other bugs.<br />
<br />
I think it makes total sense though. In the case of bugs like repeatedly completing the same WQ, or killing a world boss for loot over and over again, it was clearly not how the game was intended to be played: WQs and world bosses are clearly only meant to be done once. This is not the case with Island Expeditions, which are intended to be able to be repeated indefinitely. Players who repeatedly did Island Expeditions while the bug was active were not playing the game in any way contrary to how it was meant to be played, even if they were deliberately trying to take advantage of a bug (by doing more expeditions than they might have normally done). I feel reassured that common sense was able to prevail when Blizzard made their decision (not to ban anyone).</div></div><hr />

You should rapidly be advancing your neck up to the low 30s now because of how much the amounts to level have been reduced.</div></div><hr />

Well that was when I was 117. I am 120 now and my neck is 31 now. That's why i was so confused when it happened. Maybe it was a weekly thing?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's hogwash. People absolutely report bugs. They even compile bugs into reports for the team. There's a lot of organized, intelligent feedback.<br />
<br />
And only a tiny fraction of it is actually worked on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, i'd consider something that can alter the performance of a character a bigger problem than a cosmetic title. The fact that you think missing titles deserve more recognition than some people abusing islands giving unintended amounts of AP to skyrocket in levels is just.. wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
UPDATE: I did get hit on my lock. My neck went from 31 to 25. No idea how I benefited from the bug other than gaining like 16 levels from an IE. Oh well.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard ignores the shit out of any feedback received on PTRs and betas. That's not how you make people report more bugs lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've reported over 80 bugs during beta (single leveling playthrough, 3-4 days of playing), I haven't been able to replicate any of them since launch. It's as if people just assume everyone else will report and complain when no one did and the bug is still in later on. Not to say that all bugs gets fixed and Blizz is perfect. But the amount of time I hear a guildie encountering a bug and after telling them to report they just reply: Meh, probably already reported.. I mean, people just seem to love to play in a broken game and don't really want it to be fixed.</div></div><hr />

Yea, grinding arbitrary AP is not important to me. Titles I worked hard for is. wow</div></div><hr />
