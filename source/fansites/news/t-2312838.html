Because different stages. Easier to get them both done together. Plus you can always just get a recap of one.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully it will be about how they hired some real story tellers instead of who ever they have/had as the story telling has been really bad for a while.</div></div><hr />

This is the beauty for someone like myself who can't physically attend, the Virtual Ticket. Not that I'm personally interested in SC anyway, but still.</div></div><hr />

Generally opening and the e-sports stuff<br />
<br />
<br />
10 minutes scheduled for Diablo? Man fuck this.<br />

Usually just the opening and tournaments but yeah there are always restreams so it's not really an issue, I've never bought a ticket and have had no problems watching it any year.</div></div><hr />

If I remember correctly Legion was announced at Gamescom, which was the first time they did something like that (I'm so glad they're not doing it again) <br />
<br />
the deep dive is always after an expansion announce, nothing new there, just more details about the expansion.<br />

A while back, they were hiring writers under the team name of The Crucible, who would be writing for all of Blizzard's franchises. (They replaced Metzen with a team) It will be interesting if this is who is giving the talk, and who's on the team.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have bought the virtual ticket multiple times in the past and it's not worth the price, especially this time. <br />
<br />
They are literally getting people to pay to watch them advertise their new content. Meanwhile, streaming for free on Twitch would get them a lot more viewers and interest. <br />
<br />
Obviously people are free to spend their own money however they want. However, I can't logically justify paying $40 for a literal advertisement which would pay for itself long term if they actually have anything worth showing. The panels for Blizzcon this time make it an even worse deal. I would have a hard time justifying the virtual ticket at even half the price it currently is. <br />
<br />
Within minutes, Blizzcon information will be posted on the front page of MMO-Champion and within hours the panels will be up on youtube to watch for free. So unless you think $40 for a mount they could have added to WoW in actual content is a good deal, it's a scam in my opinion.</div></div><hr />

No, a digital mount is not worth $40+ to most people. You can literally buy an entire game for the amount you are talking about. And Blizzard could take the mount and actually add it for content in WoW. You know, since people already pay $15 a month to play the game.</div></div><hr />

Im married and have 3 young kids. I dont have any family to &quot;help&quot; and watch them. So when these virtual tickets come out, I buy it up. It's the only time I really get to somewhat participate in any type of &quot;con&quot;. It's worth the money...</div></div><hr />

I don't think you understand how this works, it might not be worth a full game TO YOU, but one mount alone, is $28 AUD, and a ticket is $50 AUD. The other goodie items make up the rest of the price and more. <br />
<br />
It doesn't matter how much it's worth to you, that is its value.</div></div><hr />

The in game store mounts are not content and are not worth anything close to what they cost either. That's not a good comparison.<br />
<br />
If you're rich that's great but most people have to choose between things unfortunately. So that is where something being &quot;worth it&quot; comes in to play. If you have only enough money for a game you really want or Blizzcon goodies you might think differently.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're mistaking your values, with the actual value of the item. You might think they're overpriced, but people purchase them for that price, and that is the price the people who have created it have deemed it as. <br />
<br />
Rich or poor doesn't come into the value of it. <br />
<br />
The in game store mounts and the goodie bag mounts are both mounts. They are both the same thing, a mount you pay to get. <br />
<br />
You might not be able to afford the ticket, that sucks for you, but a shit ton of people can, and pay that price. It's a shame you miss out because you don't have the money to buy it, but you aren't a special snowflake, just because you can't afford it, doesn't mean the whole price changes. <br />
<br />
Having money restrictions leads to having to choose between the things you want. It's life. You can't get everything you want all the time. Choose between the game you really want, and watching blizzcon+getting the goodies. Life is decisions.</div></div><hr />

Oh trust me, Blizzard can be very wrong, very often. And in this case, Blizzard isn't right or wrong, this is just how money, purchases and the real world works. <br />
<br />
If you go to the shops with only $5, and there's a $5 pizza you don't think is worth that but really want, and a $5 microwave meal you really want, you don't get to take both, you have to pick one. They aren't changing their prices just because you personally don't value one that high.</div></div><hr />

That's almost what I was saying though lol. I have a different perspective than you are thinking I have here. If there is a $5 Pizza I don't think is worth the price and a $5 microwave meal I really want, which is also more filling. Why would I ever buy the Pizza unless it was reduced in price?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's the thing though, just don't buy it. Don't expect the price to change, other people are happy to spend $5 on it. And as soon as enough people no longer want to buy it, they'll either drop the price or remove it from sale. <br />
<br />
Just down at the store where I live, dumpling microwave meals used to be legit $5, but no one bought them, they're now $2.50 constantly. <br />
<br />
If to you, the game is worth more, 100% buy the game, don't buy the ticket, you can watch the opening ceremony and the tournaments without a ticket, and get all the information minutes after it comes out just by watching things like mmochamp for the panels.</div></div><hr />

Right. But my point is that Blizzard could get a lot more attention and viewers by either reducing the price or streaming a version without goodies for free. I would be willing to bet if Blizzcon virtual tickets were $20 U.S instead of $40 they would sell a lot more. If they streamed it for free without goodies on Twitch they would get a significant boost to viewers to advertise to as well. Their model is outdated currently in the era of Twitch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There are statistics, algorithms, and all this crazy math they do to evaluate what cost would make them the most money. If they made it $20, and only 25 more people signed up for it, they would not make as much as money. They know what they're doing.<br />
<br />
Personally, I wouldn't pay for it, as I'd rather take a day to read all about it on MMO-Champ, and I don't care for the mount at all. But if the mount was cool, yeah you bet I'd forego a night out to eat to purchase it.</div></div><hr />

You can just feel the virtue signalling. Considering they're in Commiefornia, the very center of SJWs, this should surprise no-one. But then again, I get the idea, but the wording is just retarded.<br />
There have always been strong women in Warcraft, any true fan will tell you that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get the expansion reveal on the main stage, which will be 1 hour.<br />
<br />
then you get the deep dive which is 45 minutes.<br />
<br />
Then the Q/A which they usually DON'T go immediately into questions and most questions asked will be about the new expansion, so count that<br />
as an additional hour. <br />
<br />
2:45 of actual new information 1 hour of SJW pandering, 1 hour of pointless boss spiel.</div></div><hr />

Will be announced during the opening ceremony as per usual then get a panel where they talk about it.<br />
<br />
Been like that every time an expansion was announced.</div></div><hr />

As it turns out, with no Diablo on the table, I feel like I dodged an expensive bullet. <br />
<br />
They still might surprise us, but without so much as a single panel in the schedule, it feels really hollow to be a Diablo fan now.<br />
<br />
Well they announced a few days ago there won't be any major stuff for Diablo right now...<br />
<br />
<br />
Hey everyone,<br />
<br />
BlizzCon draws near, and we wanted to give you an update about Diablo’s presence at the show. Last year at BlizzCon, we kicked off Diablo’s 20th anniversary by announcing the old-school cathedral dungeon (if you missed that the first time around, it’s coming back in January) and unveiling Rise of the Necromancer. This year, we want to give you a heads-up that while Diablo will be on the show floor, we won’t be making any new Diablo announcements. There will be a time for that at some point in the future, but that time is not now.<br />
<br />
However, in addition to the special BlizzCon Diablo III in-game reward, we’ll also have Diablo panels for attendees and Virtual Ticket holders, and, as always, we look forward to a weekend filled with fun and revelry with the heroes who call Sanctuary home.<br />
<br />
Patch 2.6.1 is on the horizon. Looking beyond that, we’re hard at work on the future of Diablo and exploring what’s next for the franchise. Please be patient. Our passion for Sanctuary burns as bright as the High Heavens and as hot as the Burning Hells—and we’re excited to hunker down and get working!<br />
<br />
Until next time,<br />
The Diablo Development Team</div></div><hr />

<br />
JFC, why are you all still going on and on about this? <br />
<br />
NO ONE HAS ANY IDEA WTF THAT PANEL IS GOING TO BE YET! Save for the fact that it clearly will only include women voice actors. It is impossible to know if they wanted only women on the panel to spotlight specific demographic of talent or if they picked the panel due to context within their warcraft announcement and came up with a cool title for it once they realized it was all women OR maybe they could only book women and are making it sound cool. <br />
<br />
Speculating on which it is, by all means. But &quot;why cant we get men too?&quot; is the most pointless, least interesting, deadest end contribution to the conversation that we could possibly have. Give it a rest. <br />
<br />
For the record, it sounds awesome to me, whether they specifically booked only women or it turned out that way. You cant have everyone on stage and who wouldnt want a whole panel of Laura Bailey, Elisa Gabrielli, Mara Junot, Anna Maltese, Debi Mae West, Claudia Christian, Karen Strassman, on and on?</div></div><hr />

of course it makes sense, I think people are poking fun at the &quot;powerful women&quot; buzzword. Could have been anything like Women of warcraft, female heroes of warcraft. Powerful women is Huffington Post article about Wonderwoman worthy<br />

Which is totally irrelevant. No one goes to Blizzcon to watch - from the title, appears to be - an attempt to make a statement. If they want to include women in panels, include women who make sense in that panel. Hell, no one would even have a problem if they had the panel with a name like Powerful People in Warcraft and it was only women. No one minds all women panels, the same as people don't mind all male panels, but making an entire event with the express purpose of trying to make a statement is just going to piss people off because it's obnoxious.</div></div><hr />
