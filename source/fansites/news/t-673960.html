Icecrown Citadel - Save the Paladin, Save the World<br />
<br />
<br />
Hide your eyes behind your hands and push your &quot;Page Down&quot; key twice if you don't like spoilers<br />
<br />
Here, can't say I didn't warn you now, and yes I do realize you can't push the key if your hands are on your eyes. Apparently Arthas got a new champion .... our good old friend Bolvar! I won't start speculation here, even if it would be interesting to see what would happen if we didn't manage to save Bolvar before the Lich King converts him. Please note that the screenshot was taken on a Horde character, this is definitely not an alliance-only yell. <br />
<br />
Thanks to deathstar878 for the screenshot, feel free to discuss it in the original post : Icecrown pics/lore compilation (http://www.mmo-champion.com/general-discussions-22/icecrown-picslore-compilation/). The alliance version of the chat is available on Elitistjerks (http://elitistjerks.com/f15/t30118-world_warcraft_lore_storyline_discussion_spoilers/p241/#post1426160) (and is pretty much the same as the horde one)<br />

Mr. Chilly now available<br />
A few people didn't get their pet but it is now officially available. According to GMs in game people who didn't get their cute little penguin will get him very soon.<br />
The in-game penguin pet is now available. If you have already converted your account, when you log in you should receive a special something in the mail. If you are already logged in you will have to log out and log back in to get the pet. <br />

Class-Specific Interface<br />
I don't think it is required. Everyone's definition of required is going to vary quite a bit but very few mods are actually required in my experience.<br />
<br />
Building an in-game UI to handle paladin buffs is something we would like to do for Cataclysm (then again, so is &quot;overhaul every aspect of the game.&quot;)<br />
<br />
It was once a goal to make every class UI the same. Since the DK, and more recently the shaman and to a lesser-extent the druid, and then soon the warlock, we've been moving away from that. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/20442618251-gc-pallypower--required.html))<br />
<br />
Gear Score<br />
We actually talked today about adding an item level 300 shirt that did absolutely nothing but mess with mods that attempt to boil down players to gear scores. :)<br />
<br />
[...] The ubershirt solution would be pretty easy to bypass unfortunately.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, we're really not that interested in trying to shut mods like this down. Players will always have the Armory and to a lesser extent Inspect with which to judge other players.<br />
<br />
It's not an easy problem to solve. On the one hand, we can recognize that there is value in being able to determine if that guy you are considering for your pug is much less experienced and talented than he claims to be and is going to drag everyone else down and cause other players to leave. On the other hand, the WoW community seems to have become so obsessed with efficiency and so adverse to wiping that there is, in my opinion, an unreasonable demand for player skill and gear requirements even for relatively easy content. It's one thing if your VoA tank is in all blues. It's another if you're asking for Ulduar gear for your Naxx run.<br />
<br />
Many players are perfectly reasonable. However we've all run into That Guy who takes any attempt at measuring his awesomeness in the game (gearscore, achievements, dps meters) way too seriously and looks for the same in others.

Scourge Strike on PTRs<br />
It looks like several players are still posting without reading the entire thread. Until SS is working correctly on the PTR, telling us it has double resists isn't so helpful. I don't want to hit that particular nail too hard because I would hate for players not to report any bugs because they assume we already know about them. But in this case it's not going to be effective -- yet -- to tell us about your SS hits on the PTR.<br />
<br />
It's entirely possible we'll end up with e.g. a SS that hits for 80% weapon damage (like Obliterate) and does a lot less Shadow damage per disease. Unholy already ignores disease damage very much at its peril so it's probably okay if this one ability doesn't derive so much benefit from diseases. It will lose a little bit of its synergy with the other +Shadow parts of the tree though. It's just too soon for that decision. We need to see some legit numbers first.

Reincarnation<br />
As I said in the healing forums, we may drop Reincarnation to 30 base, talented to 15. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20431796675-reincarnate-gets-the-shaft.html))<br />

Warriors in Cataclysm<br />
In Cataclysm you'll get more talent points. That may open up the reality of an Arms - Fury hybrid build. We're not sure if that's something we're going to support yet or not -- we just haven't gotten there yet. For now, we don't really want to see warrior talent builds that go halfway down both specs. They aren't designed to do so elegantly. Arms is really focused around a single slow weapon and bleeds. Fury is built around dual-wielding and &quot;blendering.&quot; At the moment, an Arms - Fury build would feel (to us) a little like a Holy - Shadow build -- possible perhaps, but what's the point? That's what I meant by &quot;get both.&quot; To do so, you'd have to ignore the spirit of both trees while just trying to cherry pick all the special abilities.<br />
<br />
In short, if warriors need buffs (debatable), we are unlikely to do so by making MS - BT the dominant build. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20566566529-please-fix-mortal-strike--bloodthirst.html))</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone would be better off writing an &quot;achievement score&quot; addon.<br />
Check what instance the player has done, and how long ago those were. Based on that you'd know at least what he's got experience with.<br />
<br />
Then, check the number of kills and use that to produce a number in tandem with gear score and you'll get a much more accurate reading than just the gear score alone.</div></div><hr />

Saurfang runs with the Horde. Muradin runs with the Alliance. Curious what his dialogue is. :)<br />

Relene, I can see that too. Would be epic to fight Bolvar down to say half, then have him turn back and help us against Arthas (Maiev 2.0?). I think he's going to get Killing Blow on Arthas at this rate.</div></div><hr />

As for bolvar, he went &quot;missing&quot;. So technically he wasn't actually dead yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Probably there will be an explanation that if Bolvar were proven to live, Varian would have charged Icecrown and not Lordaeron and get himself brutally killed.<br />
Alexstrasza didn't send you to him to try and keep him calm, but to aim his anger at the Horde for a bit instead.</div></div><hr />

Saurfang Jr. is still on 3.3 DB as the Deathbringer Saurfang. So, Arthas using Saurfang's soul on Bolvar's body is still possible.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;merely a setback&quot; joke is getting annoying, especially on a world full of magic, demons and necromancers.<br />

<br />
The surprise isn't that Bolvar is in Icecrown..it's that he hasn't been turned yet. The assumption has been that Saurfang the Younger and Bolvar were turned into Death Knights, and while that seems to be true of Saurfang, Bolvar may yet be saved.<br />
<br />
What I find interesting is the Lich King's search for a new champion. Was it not originally the intention of Ner'zhul to merge with Arthas, but merely did it out of necessity? Given that the Lich King now has a body, why does he have a need for a new champion? It seems silly to me that the Lich King would need a new Arthas, when the old Arthas is more badass than ever. It just seems like an unwilling participant such as Bolvar would make a poor champion, seeing as many of the Lich King's most powerful followers are the willing. Unless of course he's meant as a lure. Hmm, I wonder?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bloodwine77</div><div class="date">2009-10-16, 02:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My biggest beef with gearscore checkers is I have met my fair share of horrible players in ToC10/25 level gear.<br />
<br />
I've been in H ToC 5-man pugs where we wipe and fail multiple times when both the tank and healer are 4500+ gearscores (scores are according to the in-game addon).<br />
<br />
There have always been players that do better jobs with less gear. Some players just know their class more than others and can squeeze out more of their characters. Also, many players are lazy or do not keep up with current trends and perform in a lackluster fashion. I'd go as far to say that I've met enough bad players at 4k+ gearscore that gearchecking is fairly worthless except to keep a 2-3k gearscored person out of ToC10/25, or to keep a fresh 80 from tanking VoA or Onyxia. Things of that sort.<br />
<br />
I have seen crazy requirements in trade chat for raids, like &quot;MUST DO 4K+ DPS FOR NAXX10 RUN!! PST WITH ACHIEV!!&quot;. At first thought you think they are on a badge farm run and want to get it over with, but the reality is in many cases they are trying to find others to carry the slack and the rest of the fail raid.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrgnDancer</div><div class="date">2009-10-16, 02:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So you are SUPPOSED to carry pugs and have a wipefest?<br />
<br />
<br />
They aren't talking about people checking out gear scores and achievements and making reasonable intelligent decisions about who gets into your progression raid. They're talking about &quot;OMG, why is this guy tanking H-Nex with a 2100 GS? He's horrible! Why I had to cast two whole heals on him during that trash pull!&quot; I've seen this myself. My alt is a druid, and her off spec is tanking. Now, as the off-spec of an alt, her tanking gear is unsurprisingly lack luster. It's not awful (and it's getting better), but it's not fantastic either. I've actually had PuGs comment about how she *only* had 31K health (closer to 35K now, but this was a few weeks ago) tanking H-VH.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously. It wasn't all that long ago that most people were in half blues-half purples, Naxx25 gear was the shit, we *drooled* over a tank with &gt;30K health in a PuG, and we were doing the SAME content. Half blues-half purples is pretty much acceptable gear up through Naxx 10. If the rest of the raid is strong then carrying someone in ALL blues through Naxx10 is no big deal (My guild got the 8 man achievement a few months ago on a mostly alt run. We had two guys below 2K DPS, and my druid's heal set at the time was as bad or worse than her tank set is now. We has three or four mostly Ulduar geared people that kept things from falling apart). Naxx25 gear acceptability runs at &quot;mostly heroic purple&quot;. <br />
<br />
Doesn't mean you need to bring a guy in all blues on your ToC run, or even your Ony run, but people are getting ridiculous about gear score. <br />
<br />
<br />
On the Bolvar issue, I see this going one of three ways. Either both Horde and Alliance are trying to rescue Bolvar (for their own reasons) and Saurfang the Younger is the &quot;Greatest Deathknight&quot;; both Saurfang and Bolvar are still alive and get converted at the last minute then each faction has to fight the opposite faction's hero; or each faction has to fight their OWN faction's hero to save the other faction's hero. The second one could go a long way to helping Blizz get the whole faction war hinted at in Cataclysm going. Horde is forced to Kill Bolvar and/or Alliance is forced to kill Saurfang Jr. and the opposite faction misunderstands. Much hilarity ensues as the Lick King manages to start a very destructive cross faction war even as we're killing him. I think the first option is most likely though. There's a good balance with the LK trying to replace Tirion with Bolvar as his champion. Both are Paladins as Arthas was in his former life.</div></div><hr />

As others have said wrathgate video made as much clear and the quests afterwards with the dragon queen. The bolvar story is the best story of wotlk and definitely made me happy to be alliance experincing it from setting foot up to the wrathgate ending.<br />
<br />
As for why the lich king is looking for a new champion when he has arthas is because champion does not equal a new host. It merely means a leader of the troops, exactly what all his other famous death knights were. Except this one is to be better then the rest. Tirion wasn't going to become the new lichking but he was going to become nearly as powerful if he was corrupted.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cerbdog</div><div class="date">2009-10-16, 03:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Gear score is, thankfully, something I don't see as a requirement much when I see people forming pugs on my server. Horde side on Garona seems to be real kind about this, but as we have such a low player population, we just get-by with what we have. I don't pug much since my guild, although small, is very active with 10-mans and 5-mans.<br />
<br />
The alliance side on Garona, however, is a different story from what I've seen. There they do ask for your gear score for heroics like violet hold or halls of lightening, which I find pretty unfortunate. What really makes it a pain is that players that have to put up with that will oftentimes do pvp to get some epics of a certain item level just so they look better on a gear score. These players are probably perfectly competent at their class in mostly blue pve gear and could easily do the run anyway, but they aren't permitted to go because of what they're wearing. Seems like an awful thing to put up with to me. You can't get gear unless you go on raids/heroics, but you can't go because you don't have the right gear. It strikes me as completely unreasonable.<br />
<br />
Obviously just my two cents about it, but I can't imagine I'm the only one who feels that way.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raiss</div><div class="date">2009-10-16, 03:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">you know..because violet hold is srs bsns on heroic.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because players running around with Toc-5-heroic and Conqueror (helm and chest) without a single socket and enchant is serious business. Blizzard already made gearing too easy, people should be glad and, at least, use rare gems and good enchants.<br />
<br />
<br />
A player should be able to choose with who he is going to raid, period. If you are a DPS that can pull easy 5k on heroics, it's normal that you will want all players with similiar gear level, so you can run that boring heroic as fast as possible. I think the problem is the Heroic Daily, that &quot;forces&quot; end-game players to run lower content everyday. Players with 245ilvl just shouldn't do 180ilvl content.<br />
But I must agree that iLvl isn't what you should be specing on. I'd invite a player with average ilvl200 gear full enchanted before any 230 without basic enchants.<br />
<br />
But I do hate gearscore, one single person with this add-On will lag the whole raid. Addons like this should be banned, really. ToC 25-man is so laged that we had to download a add-on so we can check who is using heavy addons that lag the raid. It's just.... stupid.<br />
<br />
btw:<br />
<br />
Alexstrasza: [Draconic] They must not discover the fate of the young paladin. Not yet. <br />
<br />
I just wonder if Blizzard allowed the &quot;bug&quot; on purpose, so people could speculate about it. Now it seems pretty obvious that, at Yogg vision, Lichking is turning Bolvar into a Deathknight. <br />
<br />
I wouldn't be surprised if there are some special encounters at Icecrown, like Algalon. Where is Mal'ganis? :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I'm pretty confident that the Lich King will be channelling Bolvar when you meet him, and he will be interrupted, leaving Bolvar half turned/half normal. You will have to kill Bolvar first, then someone like Triton will cure Bolvar and he will fight alsongside you, sacrificing himself in the end.</div></div><hr />

you can't really blame them. those people burn through the game without taking a second to understand what they are doing. then when something like this happens they are totally clueless, and just start saying random things to feel part of the discussion. wait... i guess you can blame them after all.</div></div><hr />

The assumption has been that Saurfang the Younger and Bolvar were turned into Death Knights, and while that seems to be true of Saurfang, Bolvar may yet be saved.<br />
<br />
What I find interesting is the Lich King's search for a new champion. Was it not originally the intention of Ner'zhul to merge with Arthas, but merely did it out of necessity? Given that the Lich King now has a body, why does he have a need for a new champion? It seems silly to me that the Lich King would need a new Arthas, when the old Arthas is more badass than ever. It just seems like an unwilling participant such as Bolvar would make a poor champion, seeing as many of the Lich King's most powerful followers are the willing. Unless of course he's meant as a lure. Hmm, I wonder?<br />
<br />
<br />
because if he didn't have a new champion we would only have 11 bosses, and one less plot twist. HELLO McFly!<br />
<br />
as for the &quot;willing&quot; part. sure there have been those that have willingly given themselves to the lich king, but once they are his they are under his near unbreakable total control. the only instances where we have seen members of the scourge break free of the lich kings will were darion mograine (and his knights), and slyvanas. both didn't enlist with the lich king willingly they were enslaved, and only broke free from his control during extraordinary circumstances (sylvanas when illidan attacked the frozen throne a second time weakening the lich kings powers, and darion and his knights when Tirion &quot;defeated&quot; the lich king at lights hope chapel.). Bolvar will still be a boss fight in ICC, but it will probably end with the obvious redemption of his soul.</div></div><hr />

Warriors in Cataclysm<br />
In Cataclysm you'll get more talent points. That may open up the reality of an Arms - Fury hybrid build. We're not sure if that's something we're going to support yet or not -- we just haven't gotten there yet. For now, we don't really want to see warrior talent builds that go halfway down both specs. They aren't designed to do so elegantly. Arms is really focused around a single slow weapon and bleeds. Fury is built around dual-wielding and &quot;blendering.&quot; At the moment, an Arms - Fury build would feel (to us) a little like a Holy - Shadow build -- possible perhaps, but what's the point? That's what I meant by &quot;get both.&quot; To do so, you'd have to ignore the spirit of both trees while just trying to cherry pick all the special abilities.<br />
<br />
Seems that this guy is the only person in Blizz team that knows less than most players... referring to warrior talents (but seriously, why warriors? are they still so op?) like they will stay way they are through revamp in cataclysm... Best trash comment about warriors I've ever seen!</div></div><hr />

Check what instance the player has done, and how long ago those were. Based on that you'd know at least what he's got experience with.<br />
<br />
Then, check the number of kills and use that to produce a number in tandem with gear score and you'll get a much more accurate reading than just the gear score alone.<br />

Just FYI, but that kind of got retconned. Spoiler below...<br />
<br />
Arthas and Ner'zhul in the latest novel have a few conversations inside his mental dreamscape. Ner'zhul wants to complete the merger and become one, but in the end Arthas, using a dream version of Frostmourne, stabs the soul of Ner'zhul and destroys/banishes him. The Lich King is Arthas, having removed Ner'zhul and Matthias Lehner (what was left of his good soul) before awakening to begin the war we take part in today.</div></div><hr />

They're talking about &quot;OMG, why is this guy tanking H-Nex with a 2100 GS? He's horrible! Why I had to cast two whole heals on him during that trash pull!&quot; I've seen this myself. My alt is a druid, and her off spec is tanking. Now, as the off-spec of an alt, her tanking gear is unsurprisingly lack luster. It's not awful (and it's getting better), but it's not fantastic either. I've actually had PuGs comment about how she *only* had 31K health (closer to 35K now, but this was a few weeks ago) tanking H-VH.<br />
<br />
I mean seriously. It wasn't all that long ago that most people were in half blues-half purples, Naxx25 gear was the shit, we *drooled* over a tank with &gt;30K health in a PuG, and we were doing the SAME content. Half blues-half purples is pretty much acceptable gear up through Naxx 10. If the rest of the raid is strong then carrying someone in ALL blues through Naxx10 is no big deal (My guild got the 8 man achievement a few months ago on a mostly alt run. We had two guys below 2K DPS, and my druid's heal set at the time was as bad or worse than her tank set is now. We has three or four mostly Ulduar geared people that kept things from falling apart). Naxx25 gear acceptability runs at &quot;mostly heroic purple&quot;. <br />
<br />
Doesn't mean you need to bring a guy in all blues on your ToC run, or even your Ony run, but people are getting ridiculous about gear score. <br />
<br />
I don't mean this to sound like one of &quot;Those posts&quot; but it's going to anyways: <br />
What we are seeing is a direct result/action to Blizzard's creation of more accessible and easy content. When content was &quot;hard&quot; or at least getting gear was somewhat difficult, Heroic gear and Naxx/Ulduar gear was impressive. Progression was very straight forward and took some time <br />
<br />
But now?<br />
<br />
Just hit 80 and walk into ToC, or even H ToC if you have friends who can carry you. You can jump straight into gear comparable to Ulduar normal. Run normal ToC 25/10 , Vault 25/10 and your Heroic Daily. That's roughly 50 badges a week, which is enough to almost 2 pieces of 10 man Tier 9. I'm not saying the content is EASY, but the speed at which you can gear up to current gear levels has never been faster in the history of WoW. <br />
<br />
As a direct result of this ease of gearing the expectations of players involving gear has skyrocketed. It's now expected you have a huge &quot;gear rating&quot; it's now expected that your tanks have close to or above 40k health, your healers with 2.5k SP, your DPS all above 6k. Fights have become so easy that people are no longer used to non-one-shots. If you wipe once on Emalon, 6+ people Rage-Quit. If they get, or don't get their gear off Koralon, 5+ people quit. You need achivement links and stat links and gear lists to get into even Heroic Dailies or Naxx. <br />
<br />
For every action there is an equal reaction. Because Gear acquisition has become easier and fights have become easier, Player expectations have become higher, and patience has become lower. Everyone wants immediate gear, immediate results and with minimal effort or hassle required. <br />
<br />
I blame those people who demand gear scores and armory checks and achievement links a lot. But at the same time I can't fault them for doing it as it's just a natural reaction to the direction of the game. <br />
