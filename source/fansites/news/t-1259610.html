Patch 5.2 - Darkmoon Faire Updates<br />
In Patch 5.2, the Darkmoon Faire daily quests (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/world-events/darkmoon-faire?filter-daily=1) no longer reward a Darkmoon Prize Ticket (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/515-darkmoon-prize-ticket) directly, but instead reward a Darkmoon Game Prize (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/93724-darkmoon-game-prize). <br />
<br />
This usually contains a Darkmoon Prize Ticket (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/515-darkmoon-prize-ticket), but also has the chance to contain a Darkmoon Top Hat (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/93730-darkmoon-top-hat). If you aren't lucky enough to get one out of the prize, you can purchase one from Gelvas Grimegate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/14828-gelvas-grimegate) for Darkmoon Prize Ticket (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/515-darkmoon-prize-ticket) x 10.<br />
<br />
Patch 5.2 also adds the Darkmoon Fishing Cap (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/93732-darkmoon-fishing-cap), but no source has been determined for it yet. <br />

<br />
<br />
PTR Class and Set Bonus Issues<br />
At this point in 5.2 development, we are greatly slowing down on class mechanic changes. There will still be some, particularly in response to feedback and PTR testing, but ideas for new talents, core spells and the like are even less likely to get our attention now.<br />
<br />
We still have not completed our tuning pass. You’ll know we're in the midst of it when you start to see a lot of PTR notes with number tweaks. Having said that, if you have specific concerns about PTR (not live) numbers, and you have some kind of mathematical evidence to back those concerns up, please let us know.<br />
<br />
As always, this is not a good thread for whining. No thread is really ideal for whining, but we'll be particularly vigilant here. Sorry to end on a negative note, but it will likely be another long thread and we want to maximize the prospects for communication.<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
To stave off the controversial Protection haste issue, we are making a chance to Grand Crusader to proc from dodge and parry at 30% instead of CS and HotR at 20%. This will improve dodge and parry slightly for active mitigation purposes without negating the +haste slant that many paladins have taken.<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
This is very much a PTR experiment, but we are going to try moving Blazing Speed to the top talent tier to replace Scorch. Scorch will become a baseline Fire spell. Blazing Speed’s old position on the talent tree will be replaced with a new talent.<br />
<br />
The new talent is currently called Flameglow, and it is a “permanently on” ability that reduces all damage taken by a flat amount, based on spellpower, up to a maximum of 30% of the hit. The intent is to give mages a passive defensive option, and also one that varies with the frequency of incoming damage. Remember, mages must give up Temporal Shield or Ice Barrier to take the new talent.<br />
<br />
We agree with the feedback that Blazing Speed makes more sense grouped with the movement talents than with the defensive talents. In addition, we have buffed Ice Floes already from live, and we have added an additional perk that spells cast within the first half a second of Ice Flows don’t consume a charge. Currently if you’re making use of spell queuing, it’s easy to waste the first charge, so this fix is intended to help with that.<br />
<br />
That brings us to Scorch. Sorch feels really valuable to many players (above and beyond Arcane using it rotationally to avoid dropping stacks), but we’re concerned that it feels more valuable than it actually is. Yes, Elemental and Hunters can do a lot of damage while on the move, but not every spec in the game needs to do so, and mages have a lot of other advantages. Mages do have several tools to deal with movement, such as several instants and abilities such as Blink and the tier 2 talents to minimize movement time. We’d rather seem mages plan, move quickly, and plant rather than just stay moving all the time. Scorch preempts all of those tools and has the added psychological benefit of feeling like you’re always doing something, and because of that feeling of being productive, we’re concerned you have less motivation to minimize movement. Mathematically, if you’re making full use of your available tools without Scorch, Scorch isn’t much of a benefit of all, and we think the mage class would feel and play better overall without Scorch as a crutch. We debated removing Scorch completely, and we still might, but we’re sensitive to the fact that so many mages are using Scorch today and might not understand or appreciate its loss. As a compromise, we’re going to try Scorch as Fire only to preserve the gameplay for players who really like it and to help differentiate the Mage specs a bit more.<br />
<br />
This is a big change, and the kind of thing we might revert if we and you don’t like how it plays. Try it out and let us know.<br />
<br />
EDIT: The correct Grand Crusader number is 30% in case you're trying to theorycraft it.<br />
<br />
Unless you can demonstrate that &quot;scaling&quot; is going to cause a 5-10% DPS difference between one spec and another within a single tier (say 13 ilevels or so), we're not inclined to mess with it. I'm not trying to dismiss the concerns, but it's become such a buzzword among players that I worry scaling discussions are drowning out other conversations.<br />
<br />
Priest<br />
- We are reverting the change to how Devouring Plague deals damage. It will have more up-front damage in 5.2 as it does in 5.1. We think the more recent nerfs to Shadow healing and Phantasm are more appropriate changes for PvP.<br />
<br />
You mean that you're leaving haste AS IS for prot, but removing GrandCrusader from proc'ing off of CS/HotR and changing that to dodge/parry? Or do you mean that you're removing Sanctity of Battle for prot, and giving us the above change as the &quot;fix&quot;? Your wording was a little ambiguous, and it makes a HUGE difference about the angry prot pally mob forming or not.<br />
No change to haste, dodge, parry or Sanctity of Battle. Grand Crusader changes to proc on dodge / parry to increase their value for active mitigation. <br />
<br />
To address other concerns I've seen: yes, this is a small nerf to DPS when not the focused tank (and is similar to blocks for warriors). Yes, this improved Holy Power generation when AE tanking (but again is similar to Revenge for warriors, which hasn't been a gigantic balance problem). No, you shouldn't have to give up all your haste gear. This change should just let any dodge or parry you do accumulate be more attractive.<br />
<br />
The tooltip for PW:S on the PTR was recently updated to show it shielding for 40% more than on live. However, the actual numbers for PW:S on the PTR do not reflect the 40% buff. Can you confirm if this is just a tooltip error or if there is an intended buff to PW:S in the pipeline?<br />
We did not make a change to PW:S points nor is there anything in the patch notes or in one of my posts as far as I can recollect. <br />
<br />
I will add that so far on our PTR raid testing, Disc priests are using PW:S along with PoH and not having abnormal HPS or mana problems. Heroic testing will tell more.<br />
<br />
Level 90 Hunter Talent - Powershot. Yes you have stated that you are trying to rebuild it, and I am positive that it will be great if you can get it to work properly, but there is no indication that it will be fixed by 5.2<br />
Until a time comes when I say &quot;Sorry, we were not able to get it to work,&quot; then you can safely assume our plans have not changed.<br />
<br />
Not 30% DR. I made the same mistake by reading it too fast. Read it again, and pay attention this time. It's a flat damage reduction (aka a number such as 3000, 2746, etc.) based on spell power, capped on a maximum 30% reduction. So if a hit would deal X damage, it deals X minus that number, but it cannot reduce the overall damage by more than 30%.<br />
This is correct. Apologies if my initial description was insufficient. The rate of incoming damage is important here.<br />
<br />
Thank you for additional feedback from everyone on various topics, though I am of course unable to comment on it all. Also recall my initial post in this thread: we're only interested in 5.2 (not 5.1) DPS comparisons for purposes of this thread, and also, no whining.<br />
<br />
Until a time comes when I say &quot;Sorry, we were not able to get it to work,&quot; then you can safely assume our plans have not changed.<br />
In fact, I posted this too soon. We have now completed rebuilding Power Shot and Glaive Toss. Both abilities always hit their primary target and are much more responsive to secondary targets in our initial testing. Once these abilities have been subjected to a QA pass, you can try them in a future PTR build and let us know how they work.

World PvP and CRZ<br />
The evil side of me wants to just reply and say something along the lines of &quot;PVP is Death. There's no escape, your character will eventually be killed, ganked, roflstomped and massacred over and over again. The only question is 'when'&quot;.<br />
<br />
On the other side, though, World PVP is not fair, there'll rarely be an equal number of forces, or at the same level... and so on. If you can push through it, at times you'll find yourself at the opposite end of the experience (revenge is a dish best served cold, isn't it?), as well as move to a different zone to continue your leveling.<br />
<br />
But, if the notion of other players being able to disrupt your gameplay at some point is something that you just don't want to deal with, then the best option is to reroll on a PVE realm, where you can decide when and how to flag yourself for PVP.<br />
<br />
Translation: Another benefit of CRZ is the money we make, we knew this would happen.<br />
There're unscrupuloous players that use unrespectful tactics to fight others and then escape unpunished. PVP realms were designed with the intent to be a place where wild PVP could take place, so... a player on CRZ killed you. <br />
<br />
Ganking is ganking, no matter if the player comes from another realm or not, this has been happening since the dark ages of WoW...

LFR Feedback<br />
Looking at people with epic gear should be a motivator to get yourself into raiding, and if you don't have the time for it, then to bad for you. Get over it.<br />
You can't control people's motivations. For many players out there, gear is not the objective, just the mean to an end (defeating more difficult foes).<br />
<br />
Having LFR as a tool for those who cannot commit to organized is fine (all thought I dont agree to it), but why do they have to get gear from it? It's not like they're gonna need it if they're not gonna start in normal/HC modes. They get to see the content anyway.<br />
We all log in to progress our characters, so removing gear from the Raid Finder because &quot;they're not gonna start in normal/HC modes&quot; is not really fair. Also, there are players that do take the gear they get from Raid Finder to normal/Heroic modes, as they use this venue as just another way to gear up and get something better in those slots than the blues/greens from the leveling experience and 5-mans.<br />
<br />
I wish there was an LFR for every raid mode i.e normal etc...<br />
It wouldn't really work though. 25 strangers that have never played together would not be able to defeat Garalon (just look at the changes his Raid Finder version went through shortly after being released on the live realms).<br />
<br />
I've been an active raider from Molten Core to Dragon Soul, but nowadays I've grown a bit tired of adhering to the schedules of organised raiding guilds. Now I prefer raiding on my own terms, whenever I feel like it, and LFR grants me that. It's what keeps me subscribed to this game. I wouldn't mind a bit more ilvl disparity between LFR and normal/heroic (I think 5.2 is doing that already?) but I'd like to keep the ability to see the raids and improve my character please.<br />
This is something I've seen around myself (and I guess I'm not the only one that can relate to this experience?) as we get older, and schedules, real life, work and other things get in the way, some friends had to become more casual in order to keep playing. <br />
<br />
Just as a reminder, next Monday, WoW will turn 8 in Europe, just think about how much your life has changed in 8 years, even if you weren't playing back in Vanilla.<br />
<br />
If you don't have a time for something. Why should you as a game creator make it easier for those who doesn't have time to play your game? I don't get it!<br />
The opposite would be having raid content be seen by a minimal amount of players, which is not good, particularly when it comes to how the developers can better spend their time designing content.<br />
<br />
So basically, because I'm 30 years old and married with a child, i work 9-11 hours per day and can not commit to my guild raiding time, I'm not entitled to the option of seeing raids or getting some gear, I do not pvp, I never had, used to be able to raid in vanilla and BC, but now I can't and lfr is perfect for me<br />
Not so long ago (12 years ago?) it was believed that the average gamer stopped playing videogames at some point on his mid 20s due to real life constraints and would stop playing altogether. <br />
<br />
If you think about it, and the games we had back then, it kinda makes sense. Most of them were still rather hardcore and not accessible to what we consider today a casual gamer, so it's not entirely surprising to see people out there that think that because you're 30 years old you shout put gaming down and move on.

Two specs (First Fire, now Arcane) down, one left to ruin (though, Frost is so far behind as is, no one will notice).<br />
<br />
Not only do we not have scorch to help maintain charges any more, they removed our ability to do any sort of consistent effective damage while moving as well.<br />
<br />
Laughably, citing that &quot;Hey! You (Mages) don't need to be able to do competitive damage while moving, like say Hunters or Locks&quot; - no, no instead we want you to plan, plant, etc.. - ie. Play better &amp; harder to just keep up with other classes that can do so with ease. <br />
<br />
Nevermind that the lvl90 talents for mages on their own are by far the most lame (necessity to play well Very well to be competitive, at the same time extremely restrictive in movement) in the game.<br />
<br />
Yeah Blizz, that works fine in LFR - not so much in Heroics where the ability to move at a moments notice (While doing good DPS mind you) is a considerable part to the success of an encounter.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It was more like 35% because of the LFR, afaik. And what reason to play if you dont PvP, raid or do both? Is there a reason to even log in at this stage? I doubt that the people who just play to pick up flowers even log in 4 hrs a week, whereas raiders are usually online 4 times a week for 4 hours MINIMUM!<br />
<br />
Everything in this game is based around raiders, the professions and their perks... the consumables, materials and so on would be useless and would collapse without raiders. WoW revolves around raiders and PvE, sorry.</div></div><hr />

Where the fuck are the Balance druid and Elemental Shaman changes.<br />
Should I as a balance druid wait for the next expansion to get a fix ?<br />
<br />
- I'll give all my gold to a Balance druid using Dream of Cenarius ! I challenge Blizzard to find one !<br />
- I'm still using the ONLY class which has silence on a 60 sec cooldown while everyone retain their blanket silences with 24sec cd<br />
- They have reverted Cyclone to be the shortest range CC ever<br />
- Mighty bash is still melee and can be dodged and parried<br />
- Force of Nature treants that could be summoned like mirror images still require us to click the ground (and lose the target sometimes)<br />
- Soul of the forest will never be used by ANYONE because it screws dot duration (hello!!!! we lose 2 sec on our dots without t14) and makes them finish always when you are in the middle of eclipses<br />
- Barkskin only reduces damages by 20% every other class can reduce them by 50% and more<br />
- Lunar Shower is still crap for movement dps<br />
- Starsurge still triggers multiple times but we can't use it becase if you are playing at range from your target you have to wait for the previous one to hit the target<br />
- Did a blizzard emplyee ever tried to kill a FC Warrior with his balance druid? hint: you can't outdps his passive healing !<br />
<br />
Do blizzard think it's balanced that a shaman can bring to a group <br />
self ress+mastery+intellect+stormlash totem+healing tide totem+heroism while me as balance struggle to find a group for challenge modes because i no longer bring CoE (earth and moon) nor heroism ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Secondly - Some spells and abilites scale differently. So a class might become totally useless compared to another one in certain situations. Making character swapping become the only way to progress in raids...<br />

In Vanilla mounts cost like 1000g each. He doesn't have enough gold, but Loki appears and 'blesses' him with all the gold he needs. Flash forward to today's LFR loot system where he wins only gold and never sees or receives loot.</div></div><hr />

Half the people crying about ´scaling´ don´t even realize what it is referring to. Back in Vanilla, there were a ton of classes who had flat damage on their abilities. This meant that classes that scaled with AP jumped WAY ahead of them every tier. Heroic strike did 274 damage no matter if you were in tier 1 or tier 5. Warriors did not scale well.<br />
<br />
Since WOTLK at least, every ability scales with AP or SP. Some classes benefit more from AP, others benefit from hitting haste threshholds etc etc. But the point he was trying to make is that EVERY class and EVERY ability now scales with gear, and within a single tier, no class is going to go from ´balanced´on patch day, to -5% by the end of the tier because of gear. It is more possible that a spec may jump ahead by 5% if some haste threshold is hit, but that wouldn´t be ´my class is 5% behind´ that would be every class is 5% behind and they would nerf the one ability causing the OP issue.</div></div><hr />

This is actually not true. Some Hunter abilities were straight increases (Aspect of the Hawk, for example) through Cata, which is why they needed buffing in DS. This was fixed in MoP tho.</div></div><hr />

He is PRO old players. Any MMORPG before WoW was pretty hardcore and expensive (internet costs, subscription fees etc.), so in the beginning the WoW player base was also pretty hardcore. They didn't have a problem with extensive farming, grinding and wiping. But during the past 8 years the player base evolved overall. games are much more accessible today, no matter if you're playing GTA, Skyrim or WoW.<br />
<br />
Some older players tend to see themselves as &quot;oldschool elite&quot;, because they grew up with games like Mega Man, Civilization, Everquest, Zork or Falcon 4.0, which weren't &quot;casual&quot; at all. I think this attitude is quite antiquated and extremely &quot;geeky&quot;.<br />
<br />
Computer games are not a safe haven for lost souls and nerds anymore. They are mainstream. It's okay to play as an 30+ person ;-)</div></div><hr />

The opposite would be having raid content be seen by a minimal amount of players, which is not good, particularly when it comes to how the developers can better spend their time designing content.<br />
<br />
Don't know how to link blues but, why are they saying this when most people i know and in general says TBC was the best raiding they had?, not many got to see it and yet people still found it awesome, i just don't get it really, LFR should never be about gear at all, but that's the only reason 80% does it, there's a few rare people that do it to see the bosses, never met one myself though, most just says &quot;hmm did not get the gear i wanted on this boss, i'll just leave LFR&quot;.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm sure nostalgia has nothing to do with it. It was the first time I played WoW, to me it was fun only because of that reason. It was still extremely fresh and most people that remember and were here for BC remember it that way as well because now we have had so many expansions.<br />
<br />
Also LFR is about people who don't have time to raid, those people who don't have time to raid normals don't magically not want gear anymore.</div></div><hr />

The thing is... the MOP expansion is much more than just 13 ilvls... and the gear will continue to scale abilities and make them more and more unbalanced. What was 10% over 13 ilvls - becomes 100% over 130 (we are already at 100 ilvls now after patch 5.2). <br />

Cross realm zones create new issues that were not there before. It has nothing to do with new community. It has to do with LACK of real server community that was there before. You see exact same thing all across the field - LFR and LFG - but ofc its worse in gankfests like PVP zones. PPL act like morons cause they get away with it cause the chance of seeing those ppl again is so low. Low lvl ganking is now a norm when it was exception before.<br />
<br />
So the members of the community have not changed. The server structure and their populations have been changed. Thats Blizzards doing - not the players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I get your point of the entire expansion, but Blizzard does rebalance during each patch.. so if the devs balance something at the beginning of a patch, you only really have 3 months or so (ha) for scaling to cause things to unwind. I am sure it is with that in mind that GC asked someone to prove to him that scaling would be an issue. If the devs only balanced classes at the very beginning of an expansion, and then you had 100 ilvls of gear changes, then definitely I could see classes become very unbalanced.<br />
<br />
And that is what GC is asking. Show him a spec that because of haste or spirit (primarily) gained within a tier, that spec will go from balanced at the start of the tier, to more than 5% OP at the end of the tier. Is there a certain crit, or haste threshold that will drastically alter the rotation of a spec to allow them to do something new that gains them that much of an advantage. Is there a mana-regen threshhold at which point a healing spec can drastically alter what spells they are casting to the point where they are now drastically better than the other healers who also have gotten similar upgrades?<br />
<br />
That is what GC is asking.. show him the mechanism for a spec that allows gear to create those type of drastic changes in gameplay within a tier.</div></div><hr />
