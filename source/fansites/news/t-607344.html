<meta name="description" content="Arena Season 4 Items now in German and French 
The season 4 item lists are now fully translated in German and French, I can't promise I'll do that everytime there is a major feature added to the game because it takes a tremendeous amount of time, but I guess it will make a few people happy. 
 
The remaining parts of each parts of each post will be translated later today, any help on the german version would be greatly appreciated.

The9 Manually Set Chinese Realms' Isle of Quel'Danas Progress (Via WoWinsider (http://www.wowinsider.com/2008/05/02/wow-china-gets-all-access-pass-in-queldanas/))<br />
&quot;The9, the company that operates World of Warcraft in China has announced today that all Chinese realms will have their Isle of Quel'danas progress manually set to be fully completed, since &quot;all players have contributed as they should to the world event&quot;. They also apologized for the server problems players experienced these past few weeks, while wishing everyone a happy Mayday (a four-and-a-half day holiday this year in China).<br />
<br />
This rather drastic measure comes amidst widespread player complaints of their servers' poor performance after patch 2.4. Many of the more populous realms suffered frequent restarts and periods of downtime, especially at peak hours. As a result, a significant number of these realms also fell victim to rollbacks. Some of the hardest hit realms had their IQD progress reset multiple times in a single day.&quot;<br />

<br />
Every server in BG9 goes down 3 times daily, with lag inbetween after 2.4 and we get what? 1 day free playtime! The chinese get handfed progress and items.<br />
<br />
Not really suprising considering the joke that is chinese WoW.</div></div><hr />

Chinese players pay by the minute, so The9 is actually pretty cheap by doing that. ::) And what items are handfed exactly? It's not like the epic gems don't cost badges on Chinese realms.</div></div><hr />

(Quote from http://tobolds.blogspot.com/2007/07/how-much-would-you-pay-per-hour-for-wow.html):<br />
In China World of Warcraft is payed per hour, at a rate of 0.45 Yuan per hour. At today's exchange rate, that is 6 US cents per hour of World of Warcraft. But of course the wages in China are lower, and 6 US cents buys you more stuff in China than in the US. So at purchasing power parity (PPP) the 0.45 Yuan per hour correspond to about 25 US cents per hour. Which isn't quite that cheap any more.<br />
<br />
Well, I prefer the monthly system still...<br />
<br />
Oh BTW: If you're making a british/US flag for the english language, you should also make a german/austrian flag for german! :O (we exculde switzerland now cos they dont just speak german but also french and italian)</div></div><hr />
