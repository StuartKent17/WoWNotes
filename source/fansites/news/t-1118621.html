BattleTags Now Live...ish!<br />
The Diablo III beta is now connected to the live version of Battle.net. If you are in the Diablo III beta, or your friends are in the Diablo III beta, you are able to add them to your friends list via Battletag in Diablo III. Once they are added, they will appear on your friends list in WoW, allowing you to take part in cross-realm activities together. You can even add your friend's other friends by BattleTag (when they are BattleTag friends and not RealID friends with the player).<br />
<br />
If you want to take advantage of this, be sure to add your friends before May 1, when the Diablo III beta ends (http://www.diablofans.com/blizz-tracker/topic/220928-the-diablo-iii-beta-draws-to-a-close/). If you don't, you will be stuck waiting until May 15 when Diablo III is released to add any new friends. There is no word yet on when we will be able to add people in WoW directly by BattleTag.<br />

Horde Pandaren Introduction<br />
After leveling a new Pandaren character the player must choose a faction to leave The Wandering Isle. After selecting a faction you meet with the faction leader to learn a little bit more about the faction. <br />

WoWDB Pet Pages Update<br />
Work continues at a steady pace on WoWDB, with the addition of more information for Pets after the changes in the last Beta build. We now have fixed the dedicated pages for all of the Battle Pet abilities and added more information to each pet's page. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/april/petSkillNews.png <br />
<br />
The tooltips for individual (http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/169-deep-breath) abilities (http://www.wowdb.com/pet-abilities/230-cleansing-rain) will show you which pets the attack is strong against, and which pets the attack is weak against. The page will also show you which pets can learn the abilities. On each pet's page (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/23811-jubling), we have listed all of the spells that the pet can learn. We will continue to add features as the system is fully implemented in the beta.<br />

Patch 4.3.4 64-bit Client<br />
If you are having trouble getting the Launcher to work correctly with Patch 4.3.4, don't forget to delete the following files if you have the 64-bit client installed: Battle.net-64.dll, MovieProxy.exe, WoW-64.exe. <br />
A 64-bit client is once again available for use with Patch 4.3.4. Before being able to launch WoW in 64-bit mode you will need to download the 64-bit client for PC/Mac (using one of the links below), and unzip it into your World of Warcraft directory. Once you extract the files you can start the 64-bit client by opening the Launcher as normal (Run as Administrator if applicable). To switch back to the 32-bit client, go into Options -&gt; Game Preferences, and check the Launch 32-bit client setting. The game will display which version you are using at the bottom left hand corner of the login screen. ex: Version 4.3.4 (15595) (Release x64)<br />

Next wave of Mists beta invites?<br />
As soon as we're ready to invite more people to test the beta, we'll let you know as we have with previous waves. <br />
<br />
It just wouldn't be very helpful if we made an advanced warning announcement that an advanced warning announcement will be coming soon. 'Cause then people would be asking for hints as to when the warning about the warning is coming. Pretty soon they'll want clues about the hints about the warning warning to come before the announced announcement.It's not a good idea to look at it that way since we're not sticking to an invite schedule. We invite large chunks of Annual Pass holders, then we give it a while to monitor realm stability and population. Each wave of invites has a varied impact on the beta test. We can't know in advance how many of the people invited will start playing right away (if at all), or how often they'll all play, etc.<br />
<br />
Once things start to stabilize after invites are sent out and we see more predictable statistics, we'll set up another wave and start inviting more people. It isn't an exact science, which also means it's not very feasible for us to be transparent about every step of the process between waves of invites being sent.<br />
<br />
There are a few simple goals with beta:<br />
<br />
- Get plenty of people testing all the new content/features so we get solid feedback, as well as address bugs and crashes<br />
<br />
- Get the remaining Annual Pass holders in as quickly as possible so they're given what they've been guaranteed<br />
<br />
- Make sure the environment is stable enough that we can accomplish the first two goals<br />
<br />
Having said all of that, I just want to try and drive the point home that you'll virtually never get an adequate answer when you ask us when another wave of beta invites will be going out. The community team will be notified once the developers and producers are prepared to invite more people. We get the messaging together, localize it as needed, and post as soon as we get the green light. There's virtually no point in that process where publicly providing estimates on when the next wave is coming will be useful, as that whole process generally happens within a matter of hours (not days or weeks).<br />
<br />
Aside from being unable to get everyone into the beta myself, I hope this info helps a bit. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/221053-next-wave-of-mists-beta-invites/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4489049500?page=11#218))<br />

Battle.net® Update: Updated Terms of Use<br />
In preparation for the upcoming launch of Diablo® III, we’ve updated the Battle.net® Terms of Use to cover some key changes that will be occurring prior to the game’s release.<br />
<br />
New Battle.net Balance Limits and Security Requirements: With the upcoming release of Diablo III’s currency-based auction house, account security will become more important than ever; we are making a few changes to ensure that players who wish to use the auction house have a safe and worry-free experience. Beginning prior to the launch of Diablo III, in order to carry a Battle.net Balance greater than $100 USD (or equivalent), players will be required to attach a Battle.net Authenticator or Battle.net Mobile Authenticator to their Battle.net account. In addition, we will be instituting a Battle.net Balance maximum limit of $250 USD (or equivalent). We’ll go into more detail about the different options for making purchases in the currency-based auction house prior to launch.<br />
<br />
Global Play: When Diablo III presales began, we mentioned as part of the purchase process that Diablo III players would be able to choose to play on game servers based in the Americas, Europe, or Asia, regardless of what region they were connecting from or which language-version of the game they purchased (with certain restrictions). As you’ll see in the updated TOU, the name for this functionality is “Global Play,” and we’ll be providing more information about exactly how it works, including the restrictions noted above, prior to Diablo III’s launch.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned to diablo3.com for further details on the currency-based auction house and Global Play in the coming weeks.

It's not roleplaying when NPCs do it. That IS their 'role' within the game. They're not 'playing' at anything, unlike we silly players. Two NPCs talking to each other =/= roleplay. Two naked worgen players in Cathedral Square talking softly to each other = roleplay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this is much different. In the blood elves case, they weren't split and some joining alliance and some horde. they all joined the horde. He's right not to trust them when this is the most heated the war between the alliance and horde has ever been. which brings me to the seconds point. <br />
<br />
They're in all out war mode now. they need to make sure that the allies they're gaining are going to be capable and not endanger their own side. when the blood elves joined, they weren't really at war, especially because thrall was the warchief. So it didn't really matter if the blood elves were capable fighters.</div></div><hr />

Every quest in Cataclysm is the same for Horde and Alliance up to Twilight Highlands where they to factions split and the quests for Horde in this zone made me laugh my ass off when the Alliance was just Meh.. <br />
<br />
I hope the challenge for Ally Pandas will be changed so they will fell the epicness of becomming a member of the alliance.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xanwryn</div><div class="date">2012-04-19, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, the guy who posted the comment about MMO-Champion having Horde favouritism was trolling, I found this pretty obvious considering the fact that MMO-Champion posted the Alliance intro yesterday (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2738-Alliance-Pandaren-Intro-WoWDB-Advanced-Tooltips-Patch-4-3-4-Notes-and-Hotfixes).<br />
<br />
Secondly, Garrosh is a dick. I can understand making you prove your mettle but he has to use the biggest enemy he can find, not one of his supposed &quot;strong orc soldiers&quot;. It just makes it look like he was essentially hoping you'd die just for his own entertainment, I didn't see a show of mettle at all. If he wanted to prove the Horde's strength he should have done so with his own race, not with another.<br />
<br />
I'm not a fan of the hole &quot;You are now Alliance, you must hate Horde!&quot; or &quot;You are now Horde, you must hate Alliance!&quot;. When Varian says, &quot;I will NOT tolerate friendships across enemy lines.&quot; that just pissed me off because so many NPCs have &quot;friendships across enemy lines&quot;. There are entire factions (many being druids or shamans) who are allies that also have tired with both the Alliance and the Horde, yet the player - who will become a hero through the games storyline - is not allowed to have friendships across enemy lines?<br />
<br />
Screw you, Varian and Garrosh. I'm gonna befriend a goblin and there ain't shit you can do about it. We're gonna the best of buds, blowin' holes in the sides of Kalimdor and the Eastern Kingdoms! TOGETHER!<br />
<br />
FRIENDS 4 LYFE, GOBBY PAL. FRIENDS 4 LYFE.<br />

Oh, also: Punching a KING in the face is far more satisfying than killing 3 ogres. Anyone can say they've killed 3 ogres. I bet all of you have killed hundreds of 'em on your level 70+ characters. Who the hell gets to say they had a scrap with a king and WON? I do! Though I do agree the bastard should actually fight back.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">esmifra</div><div class="date">2012-04-19, 09:49 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">this is much different. In the blood elves case, they weren't split and some joining alliance and some horde. they all joined the horde. He's right not to trust them when this is the most heated the war between the alliance and horde has ever been. which brings me to the seconds point. <br />
<br />
They're in all out war mode now. they need to make sure that the allies they're gaining are going to be capable and not endanger their own side. when the blood elves joined, they weren't really at war, especially because thrall was the warchief. So it didn't really matter if the blood elves were capable fighters.<br />
<br />
Actually their race actually split, BLood elfs joining the Horde and High Elfs staying with Alliance. The difference is little more than fel/arcane addiction.<br />
Now that Blood elfs are free from their addiction the difference is even less. They are basically the same race, but divided factions.<br />
<br />
The main difference player wise is that you don't get to play High Elfs, only blood elfs.<br />
<br />
For me this is more like the DKs. At the end of the introduction you need to choose a faction. That is made through a quest.<br />
<br />
As a blood elf you never need to choose a faction in game. That was made lore wise, and the player in game is already playing those that choose the Horde.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Depends on how you look at it. When I was watching the horde introduction I though how lame that you need to walk all the way to arena while Garrosh just flies there, In the Alliance quest you walk with your king.<br />
<br />
I also though alliance quest much more personal then the horde. The king decides to test you personally to see what you got. I only wish the female Panderan to join the fight instead of just standing there.<br />
<br />
In the horde I think its lame that you just fight a few mobs. I was hoping for a Garrosh fight, they aren't even horde races just some scattered big mobs from around the world of warcraft that the player will kill by the hundreds eventually. I think that is to show that Garrosh is a little cucco in the head, and actually seems to try to kill the Pandaren. Ji even states that himself.<br />
<br />
Also you enter the Orgrimmar arena and the loading screen is a wildhammer... GG Blizz you'r so BIAS!!! /end sarcasm:p</div></div><hr />

Really? You checked your bnet account not your email right?

All but a few Pandaren have been living in Exile either on the Wandering Isle or on Pandaria, unknown to the outside world, not knowing their customs, etc. <br />

Blizz are setting up Garrosh as a contemptible character; we are supposed to end up disliking him by the time Theramore [literarily] goes down.

You seem to have that backwards. In the alliance intro, as you walk through SW, you meet all of the different races in a rather comedic fashion(the drunk dwarf at the end).

Granted, you didn't say separate races -perhaps it was your grammar that threw me off -but still you seem to misunderstand the lore:<br />
<br />
Specifically, you think or suggest that (1) High Elves are a playable race for the Alliance, (2) that 'their race' split into Blood Elves and High Elves, then (3) said 'High Elves' stayed (sic) with the Alliance and therefore (4) they were ever part of the Alliance. All of which is wrong.<br />

He didn't say High Elves are playable, you even quoted the part of the post where he specifically states they they aren't playable. The Quel'Dorei race did in fact split into factions. High elves have been members of the Alliance for a very long time, many followed Kael'Thas and took on the name Blood Elves after The Third War and left the Alliance when he did, but the ones that weren't into the whole demon energy thing stayed High Elves and are a part of The Alliance today</div></div><hr />

I think they did a lousy job by cutting out important stuff.<br />
<br />
As for the video quality, it looks as good as the alliance one (at least graphically).<br />
<br />
You can see the full Horde Pandaren intro on youtube. I can't post the link here cause I'm new to the forums. :(</div></div><hr />

Could be something on my end, I suppose. I had it set to HD and full-sized, but the thing looked like 240p.<br />

You're welcome, and thank you for pointing out that video. It's definitely better than MMO-C's version.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Specifically, you think or suggest that (1) High Elves are a playable race for the Alliance, (2) that 'their race' split into Blood Elves and High Elves, then (3) said 'High Elves' stayed (sic) with the Alliance and therefore (4) they were ever part of the Alliance. All of which is wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
(1) You actually posted the phrase where I say the exact opposite.<br />
<br />
(2) Their race(nation call whatever you like) did split. Some followed kael'thas others didn't. The first called themselves blood elves and requested help from the horde through sylvannas, the second kept their name and stayed affiliated with the alliance and Dalaran.<br />
<br />
(3)and(4) High elves were part of the first alliance. Afterwards in WC3 they didn't helped the human kingdoms but still belonged to an alliance with them. Following arhtas invasion the survivers reacted to events the way I explained in (2).<br />
<br />
See Vereesa, in a book where she enters for a brief period (or was it a short story, I don't remember) she talks about many High Elfs that didn't followed kael'thas despite still suffering from the well's destruction, they stayed with alliance or Dalaran, by keeping the same relations they had before the well's destruction. And those relations where not with the Horde.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe its the way I write English, maybe its late in your country but you seem to read one thing and create a different idea in your head. For 2 times you actually quote me on things that say the opposite of what you are suggesting... I don't know.<br />
<br />
Just a word of advise don't start posts with &quot;Total lore fail&quot; I know this is mmo-champ which is known for not being friendly but it still makes you look like an uptight a**. Specially when showing afterwards that you didn't read or understood nothing of what I wrote.</div></div><hr />
