Patch 5.2 - Increased Drop Rates in 5.0 LFR 
It seems that the LFR drop rates will be increased for the current Patch 5.0 LFR content once Patch 5.2 is released.

Defense of the Alehouse<br />
It appears that Defense of the Alehouse may be the DotA style battleground that is under development. It looks like many of the buildings are placeholders, so keep in mind this is still a very early preview. <br />
<br />
It is unlikely this battleground will be in Patch 5.2, as the last official word was that it still needed new tech. Also, see the below tweet from Ghostcrawler that was in response to existing quiver models, but also applies to this preview. <br />

Patch 5.2 - LFR Item Level Requirement<br />
Just checked out the PTR, and there's an ilvl486 requirement to enter the new LFR.<br />
<br />
Now, there's no new 5 mans to buff our ilvl, so for non-raiders... exactly how are we supposed to reach this without PvP when the current LFRs drop 476 and 483s? Am I missing something here? Do you expect non-raiders to spend months (to the point the raid after thunder king is released) getting valor to buy that gear for ilvl?<br />
<br />
I know it's PTR, and it might just be inflated for testing purposes, but it seems a bit weird that you would place the ilvl requirement for the new raid above the ilvl of the gear that drops in the previous LFR.<br />
I think you've hit the nail on the head by saying it's a PTR. That's the most important thing to remember. We'll do our best to keep you informed on where we end up with the item level for the Raid Finder when we can.<br />
<br />
With some of the really unpopular changes being pushed from the PTR to the live realms, there's a feeling by several of us in the community that if we don't speak up (and speak up a lot) over things that we greatly dislike.... Then it'll go live.<br />
<br />
We know it's the PTR, but realistically... I don't think we'd be having the level of conversation concerning it if it had even been 483. (A much more realistic number as this is the Ilevel for the current LFR drops.)<br />
<br />
The other frustrating part is that several of the people saying this isn't a big deal don't seem to understand that the requirement works off an average. Not simply having one piece at that point. There seems to be a lack of understanding with how this system actually works.<br />
Completely understood and we do want people to speak up about their experiences or thoughts as long as they remember to remain constructive, (which you have.) My post wasn't meant as a, &quot;OK stop talking now.&quot; It was just meant as a way of conveying that it is still PTR and things could have the potential to change. Please feel free to continue to discuss though.<br />

Eye of the Black Prince Issue<br />
There’s currently no way to obtain an additional Eye of the Black Prince (http://www.wowdb.com/items/93403-eye-of-the-black-prince), and we’re aware it can create a situation where people are deterred from wanting to upgrade their items. That’s not the intent, we want you to use it and enjoy the upgrade then and there, and so we’re looking into a way for players to obtain additional sockets similar to how you can purchase additional legendary gems. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/250217-eye-of-the-black-prince-replaceable/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/7415516316?page=1#18))<br />
<br />
WoW City Sizes<br />
Because they are really just a representation. Having all the villages, towns etc their *proper* sizes would make them massive ingame.<br />
Pretty much this. Massive in-game towns and cities can become tedious and annoying real fast in MMORPGs because of the increased travel distances they cause... you already spend a lot of time travelling around in WoW (and other games like it), so if everything from small towns to huge continents were redone so that everything has realistic proportion and size, you would need enormous amounts of time just to travel from place to place. <br />
<br />
Towns and cities may look really awesome and have the perfect atmosphere if they are of realistic size in games (I personally know this from other MMORPGs I have played(Yes, I enjoyed playing them)), but it is annoying to be in them because you always have a lot of running to do even for the simplest tasks that are supposed to be quick... long runs between vendors, quest NPCs, banks, AHs, and other points of interest. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/250188-wow-village/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6298061623?page=1#6))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
UI / Addons<br />
Could a role selection (DPS etc), be implemented on the calendar when players sign up for events? Would make life easier!<br />
Yes, we'd like to add that. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281093757061963776))<br />
<br />
What exactly is your stance regarding that? There are a lot of addons that could vastly improve the glyph interface.<br />
Philosophically, we have no problem with customization, just automation. Would like to allow former while protecting the latter. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/282198998578778114))<br />
<br />
Please stop being so restrictive about the Glyph/Talent UI. It's driving people nuts, I loathe the moment I have to change!<br />
Philosophically, we don't want automating talent or glyph swaps. Once it's easy to reglyph every pull, players feel like they must. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/278572849529245697))<br />
I'm sorry did you just say you use &quot;bugs&quot; to prevent reglyphing every pull? Or misunderstood Znuff's tweet?<br />
I said we want to be very careful about the degree to which we let players automate talent or gylph swapping. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285141735527550976))<br />
improve the glyph interface? it's already wickedly easy to use and simple. some players and their addon addictions<br />
Philosophically, we're okay with players changing the UI. We just want to protect against too much automation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285818284249608193))<br />
<br />
Ever thought about adding a UI feature/option that displayed character health as number &amp; percentage, instead of either/or?<br />
Yes, and you should be able to try it out in 5.2. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285144916106035200))<br />
<br />
Hey who makes those icons for all the spells and abilities? I love those icon art!<br />
The art team shares the work. Good icons are hard to do so it's amazing they can make so many. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285139415943217152))<br />
<br />
can you guys improve the BM AH UI sometime down the road? I just lost 25k gold thinking i bid on a mount but it didn't. <br />
Is it the &quot;hot deals&quot; button that throws people off? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285473467300708354))<br />
It's confusion between trying to bid on a short/ending and having your money automatically go to hot deal.<br />
We can just have one bid button. I think that is in the works for 5.2. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285806863956717569))<br />

Reputation / Questing<br />
Why are dungeon tabards a mistake? Alot of people WANT them back so that they are not forced into doing dalies.<br />
Let me put it this way: What if dungeon tabards gave Honor, then you wouldn't have to PvP either? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285819500610342912))<br />
<br />
Rep Tabards weren't a mistake, removing them was. They allowed multiple ways to get rep, which was great if you hate dailies.<br />
Today, gear can come from dungeons, reps, raiding, PvP or crafting. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285811683648221184))<br />
They allowed dungeons to give rep, valor and purples, making them the only real option. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/285811545806610432))<br />
<br />
Not sure if you're the guy, but 5.1 rep grind was great. It didn't feel like a grind. You wanted to progress the story.<br />
We agree. It felt more reasonable. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280721511013294080))<br />
You should not send people into enemy hubs in PVE dailies. You should not put PVP objectives in a PVE zone<br />
Why? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280725440337940480))<br />
<br />
But endless rep grinding is an artificial way of trying to prolong an exp. It's not fun, it's boring busy-work<br />
None of those reps are anything you absolutely must have, and by &quot;endless&quot; aren't we really talking about a few weeks? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280383555496988672))<br />
Not required? No profession recipes or valor gear if I don't. More than one character. Game shouldn't feel like a job.<br />
I think you mean &quot;I want to get ALL the recipes.&quot; You don't need e.g. Royal Satchel or Gloves of Creation. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/280484895959158784))<br />
<br />
Will we ever need the extra Sigils from the legendary questline once we've completed the quest? Or can we trash them safely?<br />
Trash away (unless you're a compulsive packrat). (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281875355873198082))<br />
<br />
Like dailies now? They suck, but provided the most efficient way to grind Valor/rep unlike Mech there is no alternative<br />
Raids, dungeons, scenarios and challenge modes offer a pretty good alternative for valor generation. How bad do you need the rep? (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/281859517690548224))<br />

I really doubt it. Some will probably get more items they already have or don't need and they will complain even more. Too many people in this community who don't have a clue how things work.<br />

<br />
I think in your rush to whine about dailies you've become confused- he's talking about the 5.1 dailies, ie the ones that tie rep gained in dailies to the progression of the Divine Bell storyline. A very elegant solution for getting players invested in the dailies and the faction they support. Suspect we'll see more of this in 5.2 and future patches...</div></div><hr />

Valor was always about spending your &quot;bonus&quot; points on gear to help you progress vertically, especially when you're on a string of bad luck and just can't get your loot to drop from other sources, in this case: raids and LFR. Outside of item upgrade (which is still fairly new and doesn't seem to be returning quite yet come 5.2), Valor is a complete waste of a resource if you don't do the rep grind. You may not have to get Exalted with a faction, that's for sure, but you better at least strive for Honored/Revered.</div></div><hr />

I agree that bring back the tabards isn't the solution, but they could balance things, use both, more relevant factions like Dominance offensive should use only the Daily Quest system, I agree with that, but factions with less relevance in the lore should had the tabards available for dungeons, we would not be stucked only with daily quests everywhere and the reputation grind wouldn't be so tiring and boring, even for alts. I repeat, why must it be one or another? why not balance things and use both?</div></div><hr />

I have 10 other alts but I just do not care anymore about raiding, progression. I am gonna spend my 15 bucks to play the game how I want to play it from now on. Eventually I will get bored and take another break. The game is what it is, no use in crying over something that will never change.

They should have removed reputation tabards a long time ago. I guess only people who played before WotLK understand how ridiculous those tabards were.<br />
<br />
I play from 2005 and I agree that we need dungeon rep. Either like TBC rep/dungeon or like wrath&amp;cate with a tabard. If dailies and dungeon runs would give the same rep and people would chose to do the dungeons, it just means nobody likes dailies and they should stop putting development time into them.<br />
Fact: if dungeons and dailies would give more equal rewards, both would be avaible for players and both contents will be used by players and neither group will feel left out.<br />

Dungeons in MOP are terrible. No reason to keep doing them even if you found an amazing team in a dungeon, you just leave at the end because you only get 40VP for the next one. First Blizzard destroys realm communities by introducing LFD and now they even don't want you to make friends in LFD anymore. I didn't notice the point where suicidal goth hipsters became the target market for Blizzard.<br />
I'm sure the community will benefit greatly from letting people do simple solo content instead of learning them how to play and communicate in a group. Blizzard is so good in planning for the future and recognising how important the MM and RP are in an MMORPG to keep contineous subs. Who knows maybe that's why they went from 10mil to 2mil EU+NA subs.</div></div><hr />

But endless rep grinding is an artificial way of trying to prolong an exp. It's not fun, it's boring busy-work<br />
None of those reps are anything you absolutely must have, and by &quot;endless&quot; aren't we really talking about a few weeks?<br />
I thought it was a few weeks till I was about to hit exalted and I was all happy like yea now I have free time since I don't have to do these dailies anymore and eventually I won't have to do any :) WRONG how else do I get my Lesser Charms, looks like it's dailies forever. <br />
<br />
<br />
Not required? No profession recipes or valor gear if I don't. More than one character. Game shouldn't feel like a job.<br />
I think you mean &quot;I want to get ALL the recipes.&quot; You don't need e.g. Royal Satchel or Gloves of Creation.<br />

<br />
Dungeons lost importance somewhere in Wrath when they made them one-button friendly and that's it - they are just too easy. <br />
<br />
Cataclysm release dungeons were a challenge but mostly to healers with the revamped healing system, everyone else was still pressing one button for high DPS, while the healers without adequate gear struggled a bit. MoP dungeons are again a walk in the park again. Imagine having TBC dungeons like Shadow Lab, with todays players, like yesterday every single LFD I did put me in a group where one or two of the DPS was pulling 15-20k dps at level 90 and I was pulling aggro away from the Tank (which is not possible in todays times with vengeance etc) - It would be impossible to do any hard dungeons with those kinds of weekend players, who probably don't even understand their class properly. <br />
<br />
And of course there's no point doing dungeons for anything but to cap Valor if you're out gearing the content by 20 ilvls or more, it was always like that even in the old days, but in the old days, gearing your character in full epics or even good blues took about 3-5 months instead 3-5 weeks it takes now. <br />
<br />
As for challenge, you got the challenge modes, where the dungeons become significantly harder, the rewards are cosmetic tho.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard wants you to do quests for factions in the world, not slap on a fugly tabard and watch the Rep Bar slowly rise.<br />
From here you're free to tinfoil around about slowing people down intentionally for subs.<br />
<br />
Congratulations, you just figured out how MMOs work.<br />
<br />
Rep Tabards ruined factions completely and I'm so glad they're gone. Hard to find a so called balance for those who say they want a balanced solution.<br />
So if every finished heroic gave a set amount of reputation with a faction of choice... low amount slower than dailies because you also get Justice, Valor and 463 you might need.<br />
And then people would start bitching about it, saying it'd take too much time to reach whatever goddamn rep level they want.<br />
&quot;I NEED TO DO 60 DUNGEONS HONORED -&gt; REVERED WTF BLIZZ, 60 DUNGEONS IS WORTH X + Y AMOUNT OF VALOR I CAN'T SPEND FU!!1&quot;<br />
<br />
If you don't want to do dailies, alright. Your choice. Just don't expect to reap the rewards anyway for doing easy 5man content which also earns you other currencies and items.<br />
When did people stop understanding that in MMOs, you will have to do repetitive tasks in order to progress. Blizzard is very good at finding balance, but no. If you want to buy Valor items you get your lazy arse to Honored, and that takes merely a few DAYS.</div></div><hr />

What I wanted to say was that they should let us queue for multiple LFRs at once.<br />
Like for example, I queue for Mogu 2, HoF 2 and Terrace and whichever group is full first pops (let's say HoF 2 is full first).<br />
And then I queue again for Mogu 2 and Terrace at once and this time Mogu 2 pops and I'll only have Terrace remaining left to do.<br />

<br />
You know what the real problem is? Players are getting used to 10 minute queues and now anything longer makes them rage and quit while if you are in the queue for 45 minutes for the piss easy LFR which you finish extremely fast and gives you very good loot it's still superior to pugging normal raids.<br />
<br />
An hour long queue sucks but it is still better than the alternative. Making previous tiers irrelevant although they are still a lot of fun to do just to increase queue times is a big mistake. They already made this mistake years ago with normal raids by giving everyone badge gear to solve the problem of players not being able to catch up. Now they have LFR as catch up mechanic which is a lot more fun than just spamming heroics for JP/VP gear and I don't think we should ruin this for the sake of convenience AGAIN. They better come up with another solution to decrease queue times maybe a technical solution instead of one that influence gameplay.<br />

This will help a little:<br />

Why didn't players just demand to get the full LFR set from T14 in their mailboxes after 5.2 comes out, they would of got it.<br />

Is that serious? If you don't grind the rep the valor is worthless to any fresh 90s.</div></div><hr />

In all honesty, given the level of player aptitude I've seen in TES on many fights, I think a good number of runs should be a prerequisite before allowing people to just herp the next tier of content, and this comes from having to run previous tiers waiting on drops. 472 was required for HoF/TES, so it's not unreasonable to ask casual players to gear up a bit more.

<br />
Random is random. Its obvious that the goal from BLizzard this expansion is to &quot;make it a journey&quot; where journey means you have to stay subbed and do certain things every week to progress. How this will work when new players will come in mid expansion - and ppl with their alts as well still buying 489 gear for 1000 valor per week ... is still not clear. <br />
<br />
Its a new system and Blizzard have shown so far that they have been unable to support their new systems in resonable way in past 2 expansions when it comes to LFG or LFR. They obviously had some goals with these new systems but forgot that players determine how these systems work ... not developer ideas.<br />
<br />
The part about the journey tho.. It has to be intresting enough to work for 2 years. Cause we know next expansion is 2 years away. So far no WOW expansion has been able to keep the journey going that long. And it seems grinding and extra gated content is the only way Blizzards see this as possible instead of making good and fun game to play.</div></div><hr />

It was 10k before as well. You can just get it from a vendor now.<br />

Except the ones you're talking about are the 5.0 dailies. And even those had a little bit of story that you obviously failed to read (seriously? No progress in the story with the Klaxxi?).<br />

<br />
Who's the baddie? 'cause I think you're it. You just showed by your post that you have NO idea how to play this game properly without being carried.<br />
Hows this you say? Because your post either A)shows you don't know what your talking about before posting and being a douche, or B) You advocate NOT gemming and enchanting your weapon while you work on heroic modes...and we all know only baddies don't bother to gem and enchant.<br />
<br />
Lets talk about a high end progression raid group.<br />
As a progression raid group, before you go working on heroic modes, you still have to clear on normal. So what happens when your Sha-Touched normal weapon drops? Are you going to NOT gem and enchant it while you work on heroics until you get your heroic version? That's what this hotfix was designed to resolve, the ability for players to gem and enchant the CURRENT version of their weapon without worrying that they CAN'T gem and enchant their upgraded (heroic) version later.<br />
<br />
So either you are saying that you should raid heroic bosses without enchants or gems, or you're just opening your mouth to say something, anything, regardless of comprehension of the way the game works.<br />
Well, that determines it, YOU are actually the &quot;baddie&quot;. <br />

Sort of an issue with addons. It's a (few?) bad hooks in Bliz' API. This issue can pop up with just about any addon regardless how innocent it is.<br />

I change glyphs/talents quite often depending on what class I am , and what I am doing. LFR's, Transmog runs, Pvp... I change quit often. I try to make sure I have at least 60 tomes on me when I go to a main city.<br />

Players are getting used to 10 minute queues and now anything longer makes them rage and quit while if you are in the queue for 45 minutes for the piss easy LFR which you finish extremely fast and gives you very good loot it's still superior to pugging normal raids.<br />
<br />
Yes, now where everybody is doing it the queue is 45 minutes. Once 5.2 hits and noone above Ilvl 486 (or whatever it will be that is needed for the T15 LFR) does the T14 LFR the waiting time will go up massively (if they even start at all).<br />
<br />
<br />
An hour long queue sucks but it is still better than the alternative. Making previous tiers irrelevant although they are still a lot of fun to do just to increase queue times is a big mistake. They already made this mistake years ago with normal raids by giving everyone badge gear to solve the problem of players not being able to catch up. Now they have LFR as catch up mechanic which is a lot more fun than just spamming heroics for JP/VP gear and I don't think we should ruin this for the sake of convenience AGAIN. They better come up with another solution to decrease queue times maybe a technical solution instead of one that influence gameplay.<br />
<br />
This will help a little:<br />
<br />
I don´t see how catch-up dungeons influence gameplay. It´s old loot. Who cares if if someones alt can get the old loot that i´m replacing easier now then i did back in the day?<br />
For me it look more like one of these barely thought through philosophical design decisions Blizzard likes to do from time to time, like the &quot;Wow dungeons are hard&quot; stuff in Cataclysm. They do it just for the point of it or maybe because they are at heart hardcore players and then they are surprised by cancellations of the casuals.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's caused by addons likely, but it's not the addons fault as the person above explained. I can't play this game without addons tho, the default interface is displeasing to the eyes, and stuck in year 2000 design land. <br />
<br />
Running ElvUI, Skada and EPGP, that said, ElvUI is a heavy &quot;complilation&quot;, the glyph bug happens even if I run just Dominos, Clique and Skada, I belive it would happen if I just run anything.

We should also not forget that ilvl requirements are not only to there to block you from content but also to make sure everyone is geared enough to compensate for noobs, bad players and slackers.<br />

<br />
Before LFR the way to catch up with gear was to spam heroics all day long instead of doing the previous tier raids. So there are two options:<br />
- spamming heroics and most likely skipping all raids and go straight to the newest raid<br />
- progressing from raid to raid<br />
<br />
Now with LFR we went from spamming heroics to catch up by doing LFR. Again two options:<br />
- again spamming heroics<br />
- progressing from raid to raid but now through LFR which is obviously far more accessible and faster. Boosting loot drops will make sure that everyone progresses at a good pace.<br />
<br />
How does this not influence gameplay? I don't give a shit about what loot I get or how fast I get it. I don't care who gets it. All I care about is how I get it. I rather do a raid three times instead of spamming boring heroics AGAIN.<br />
<br />
Itemlevel requirement is also a big part of this. If it's too low players will still skip a whole tier of fun gameplay. It needs to be high enough so players actually go through the 'old' content and not just skip everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We are talking about alts here. For new players it may be different but on the other hand, how many new players start in the middle of an expansion and want to get into the raid endgame ?<br />
And for alts, i'd rather run a few new heroics and then get into the newest LFR instead of doing the old shite time and time again (with the added bonus of 2 hours+ queues). In the end a dungeon you already did countless times gets boring, no matter if it's a raid or a dungeon.</div></div><hr />
