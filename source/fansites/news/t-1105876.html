Did you read the beginning of the video? These dungeons are in their early stages and will change a lot. Most likely part of that will be the overall quality of the look of the dungeon. You could see from the video there were many unfinished parts, and parts that have not been polished yet. And the graphics still look like vanilla? You are kidding yourself. WoW now on Ultra, with dx11 and all that jazz looks like a different game almost from vanilla.</div></div><hr />

6 in one, 5 in one, and 3 in the last, as Blizzard said there will be 14 bosses in the first tier of MoP.</div></div><hr />

They are all going to be with release and are all the same tier. It's similar to the start of Cata. where Blackwing Descent, Bastion of Twilight and Throne of the Four Winds were all the same tier.</div></div><hr />

I agree man totally amazing also it has the feeling of Ulduar atmosphere because it's Titans creations and stuff. :)<br />

Blizzard got some awesome instance designers, but even if the arts a really cool, the graphic still looks like vanilla.The old WoW graphic engine can't really stand compared to modern games =(.It doesn't really stop you to have fun, but makes the eyes sad.<br />
<br />
Graphics isn't everything when it comes to a video game mate. Gameplay and enjoyment is way more important than graphics. For example, I enjoy playing the old Final Fantasy series (episode 4,5, and 6) more than the new ones like 10 or 13 even though the graphics is nothing compare between the old FF series and the new ones. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Seems slightly biased, because of the 5 raids only Firelands had lava. The only dark rooms I know of are two bosses of eight in Dragon Soul.</div></div><hr />

Since i started playing towards the end of Wrath, it'll be nice to get into long instances. DS is fine and all, but it can be cleared in 2 hours. I'd like to see something that takes multiple raid nights. Looks impressive so far</div></div><hr />

It will be a Tot4W type. VoA and BH where one boss per season PVP oriented, capture style, easily puggable and downable raids. I expect this one to be as hard if not harder then Tot4W, and it will have 2-3 bosses.<br />

Firelands hat lots of lava. BoT had Lava everywhere around the bosses ( Halfus , Valiona + Theralion , Sinestra ). BD: There was also Lava behind Magmaw , Omnotron , Atramedes and sure Nef had some nice lava. Well I kinda felt like the DW-Fight had a lot of lava/molten stuff. So theres been a lot of hot stuff around in Cataclysm. But I think it fits.<br />

<br />
I was referring to Cata's overall theme; look at zones like Barrens, Loch Modan, Ashenvale, etc. Drenched in lava and Twilight's Hammer stuff.<br />
<br />
-Though of the raids, Blackwing Descent was built into Blackrock Mountain, so it was filled with lava. Magmaw lived in lava and spit it, Onyxia was taking a lava bath before the pull, etc. Firelands was...again, all lava.<br />
<br />
-Bastion of Twilight was nothing but dark rooms. Got kind of depressing going in there every week. Zon'ozz and Yor'sahj could also be &quot;dark rooms&quot;.<br />
<br />
Of all of Cata's raids, Throne of the Four Winds was by far the most visually impressive. Shame it was such a quick, forgettable raid.<br />
<br />
Bring on the bright colors, Pandaria!</div></div><hr />

<br />
I assume when they realised they didn't have Raids or already Pre-Determined Lore (The Pandas have no &quot;Set Path&quot; in the way their LORE works unlike Illidan, Arthas, And Sorta Deathwing - He was a touch more flexible in Story) they thought to themselves, &quot;Lets make sure our Raids in MOP are similar to what players love the most&quot; ...So they obviously have no doubt read extensively how Basically 90% (Made up Number for Exaggeration, but I wouldn't be surprised if that's the truth) of the WoWbase, regardless of whether you raided it at the time or not, consider Ulduar and Karazhan as the top 2 Raids of all Time, Aesthetically and Mechanically. <br />
<br />
They're not going to go backwards and use the Mechanics from those raids, and nor should they, but it's good to see that they've obviously put some thought into where to go with these raids and are bringing back that Karazhan/Ulduar feel in the aesthetics of the Raids and they Look AMAZING. Now lets just hope the Boss Fights give us something to remember these by and they could damn well be some of the best raids ever (Perhaps even Top Ulduar? Who knows, Nothing can top Karazhan for me but Ulduar, these look like they stand a chance to topple it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dunno the way WoW looks is one of the reason I like it so much. Personally I don't like some of the newer games with the graphics engine they use. I felt Rift was incredibly ugly for example. They tried to make things look real a bit too hard and it just came out looking horribly dreary to me. Skyrim is the same way. Nice graphics, but very dreary. <br />
<br />
WoW on the other hand I've never seen as dreary. And I think it's b/c of the graphics engine they use. There comes a point when the fantasy world you're playing in can start to look a bit too real. Me, I rather like knowing it's fantasy when I'm looking at it. To each their own though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it will come with 5.0 Just becasue a (small) part of one raid isn't finished yet (hell it might be finished, and just not put in the game yet) doesn't mean they won't manage it in the next 4-5 months of beta testign</div></div><hr />

This is my biggest issue, looking at these raids. The art department have done wonderful work on the textures and overall feel of the environments, I can't fault that at all. But I'm sad to see that these raids are awfully linear, because that was the dullest thing about BoT and one of the many faults of DS. Very very few old raids were linear in style and it's a big buzzkill to see that these are the railroad style. I can guess that this is going to become a very normal feature with LFR though, to minimise &quot;I WANNA GO X BOSS&quot; &quot;NO WAI WE'RE GOING Y&quot; &quot;BUT MOM SAYS I HAVE TO GO IN 10 MIN OMG&quot; drama. A shame. :(</div></div><hr />

Personally (and I appreciate I may be in the minority) but I'm glad it can't. Oh sure, I wish it wasn't such a resource hog and be more laggy than a game much newer with better graphics, but if WoW lost its original vanilla &quot;cartoony&quot; graphics it would ruin it in my eyes. I have been playing and loving this game since 2005 and I love the style of the artwork. If it changed too much it would be like losing an old friend.

<br />
They are supposed to be all with the launch of MOP, whatever patch that is, 5.0.1 or something (5.0 will be the pre-launch patch I think). Of course anything could happen between now and then, but they SAY we will have all three with launch. Not too surprising, we had three with cata (BOT, TOTFW, BWD), three with BC (Kara, GL, ML), two with wrath (NAXX, OS).<br />
<br />
Having more bosses per tier COULD open the way to having large tier sets (but I cant see it happening). Would love to see 8 piece set bonuses again!</div></div><hr />

I think almost everyone agrees 8 piece set bonus was cumbersome in the way that you only managed to keep the bonus for a short period between &quot;farm of tier X&quot; and &quot;progress of tier Y&quot;. HOWever I would like to see more set pieces, now with &quot;real&quot; models for belts they could expand tier sets to 6 pieces and make the 4 set bonus the stronger one and the 2 pc bonus the weaker one (as it is now at least with my healer toons, 2pc is always way better than 4pc).</div></div><hr />

This is the same for me too. I don't want everything to be more realistic i play a fantasy game to live a seperate life in a &quot;better&quot; world. It's one of the main reasons wow kept me hooked for 7 years. I love Blizzards style. Saying that i really wanted to find something to qq about, just so i could kill an elf but i couldn't :(.</div></div><hr />

Personally I don't like some of the newer games with the graphics engine they use. I felt Rift was incredibly ugly for example. They tried to make things look real a bit too hard and it just came out looking horribly dreary to me. Skyrim is the same way. Nice graphics, but very dreary. <br />
<br />
WoW on the other hand I've never seen as dreary. And I think it's b/c of the graphics engine they use. There comes a point when the fantasy world you're playing in can start to look a bit too real. Me, I rather like knowing it's fantasy when I'm looking at it. To each their own though.<br />
<br />
I totally agree with you about Skyrim. That place is just depressing as heck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you look at most raids prior to Firelands, they all took place in relatively small spaces. I like this feeling. It feels like you're really progressing deeper and deeper into a cavernous dungeon, and hence feels more like a &quot;raid&quot;. BoT/BWD felt great for this expansion, but Firelands just felt like a giant space with a bunch of zoo animals randomly spread out in it. Dragon Soul isn't even in one consistent location. I am personally very pleased they're bringing back the old fortress/dungeon style raiding, and I don't think space will be an issue.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">willowe</div><div class="date">2012-03-28, 01:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I dont see what you're talking about.<br />
<br />
Zero raids look as claustrophobic as HoF.<br />
<br />
Naxx? No<br />
MC? No<br />
SWP? No<br />
BT? No<br />
Ulduar? No<br />
ICC? No<br />
Even T11 was more open.<br />
<br />
It seems they need to raise the roof 10 feet and widen the halls about 5 feet.<br />
<br />
The design is cool, don't get me wrong, but I don't see how a 25m raid will be able to, um, spread out. Imagine one of the encounters everyone has to spread 5 ft from each other. I don't see a single room in there the side that would accommodate that. You need a room the size of BQL (ICC) or more, and I just don't see anything in that place letting you spread out in there.<br />
<br />
The other raids are awesome, Terrace looks like another 2 boss raid like ToT4W and Gruuls, imo. Vaults is easily the biggest. My guess is Vaults has 8, Heart has 4, Terrace has 2, which gives 14.<br />
<br />
And, I am proud to kill elves. As long as they're from Silvermoon.</div></div><hr />

Would be cool if you only had to fight one in normal mode ( the other one fleeing upon his brother's death) and both in heroic. maybe even make the death of both in heroic being the trigger to access to the heroic only &quot;sinestra-like&quot; boss for t14. Having extra bosses would do wonders for heroic gear, since there's plenty of other wais to get normal mode equivalent loot (even without valor there's still acheology, reputations, crafting), but only boss drops for heroic gear...

<br />
The engine has had upgrades continuously, but there is a limit, yes. What they manage to do with the engine they have to work with, I think is amazing. I absolutely love the designs. <br />
Many 'modern' games try to make everything look as real as possible. When actually, it's all about the feeling you get, not whether it looks real or unreal. And the feeling is one thing Blizzard manages to put down perfectly in my opinion. <br />
Every instance has its own unique feeling. Doing that with 28 raid instances plus the upcoming ones is one hell of an achievement.</div></div><hr />

Your point being? A large part of information about the expansion is data mined, like the models of the armor, weapons, new pets and mounts, and these raid instances.<br />
It's in the game files so it's public. MMO just does the work for us and posts the pretty pictures ;)</div></div><hr />
