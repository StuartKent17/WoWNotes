<br />
What Is WoW Classic?<br />
World of Warcraft Classic is a faithful recreation of the original WoW experience, as it was in 2006. Everything about the game‚Äîfrom combat mechanics and talent trees, to character models and zone layouts‚Äîhas been restored to realize a truly authentic experience.<br />

<br />
<br />
Getting Started<br />
All players with active World of Warcraft subscriptions or game time on their accounts have access to WoW Classic at no additional cost.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/thumb/classic02.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/classic02.jpg)<br />
<br />
<br />
Open the Battle.net desktop app and select World of Warcraft from the menu.<br />
Under the Version menu, select World of Warcraft Classic. If you have more than one World of Warcraft account, you‚Äôll see a second dropdown for Account. Select the active account you wish to play on from that column.<br />
Click the Install button. The progress bar will show you when the game is available to play.<br />
Once the installation is complete, click the Play button.<br />
<br />
<br />
You‚Äôll need to select the realm you want to play on from a variety of available realm types. Make sure you pick the same one your friends play on‚Äîin World of Warcraft Classic, characters can only group with others on the same realm!<br />
<br />
If you‚Äôre looking for a group of like-minded players, you can head over to the New Guild Listings forum to begin your search.<br />
<br />
<br />
Realm Types<br />
There are several different realm types to choose from. Choose carefully, as each one has a distinct play style.<br />
<br />
<br />
Normal‚ÄîThis realm type is best for those who don‚Äôt want to take part in open world PvP. All zones are considered contested except for enemy faction cities, in which players will be automatically flagged for PvP. Players won‚Äôt be able to attack each other in contested areas unless they flag themselves for PvP with the command /PvP.<br />
PvP (Player vs. Player)‚ÄîThis realm type allows for open world PvP in all areas except for designated ‚Äúsafe‚Äù or sanctuary areas, such as the starting zones where new players begin.<br />
RP (Role-Play)‚ÄîThis realm type is best for those who wish to take part in role-play with others. This realm type uses the Normal ruleset and does not have open world PvP.<br />
RP PvP (Role-play Player vs. Player)‚ÄîRP PvP realms are for role-players who prefer the ruleset of PvP realms‚Äîexpect open combat in contested areas.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Creating Your Character<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/thumb/classic03.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/classic03.jpg)<br />
<br />
After you‚Äôve selected your realm, you‚Äôll be able to create a character and begin your journey in earnest. You‚Äôll choose your faction, class, and race, as well as fully customize your new character and give them a name. Select the Create New Character option to begin the process.<br />
<br />
There are four Alliance races and four Horde races to choose from. Each faction has access to nine classes, and just like in the original release of World of Warcraft, the Paladin and the Shaman classes are restricted to the Alliance and the Horde respectively.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/thumb/classesclassic.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/classesclassic.jpg)<br />
<br />
Each race has specific abilities and traits that can have a big impact on your gameplay, so choose wisely.<br />
<br />
You‚Äôll be able to create a maximum of 10 characters per WoW Classic realm, with a total maximum of 50 characters across all realms in your region. You‚Äôll also be restricted to one faction (Horde or Alliance) on PvP realms.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Abilities, Weapon Skills, Spells, and Talents<br />
Characters in World of Warcraft Classic earn new abilities as they level, based on their class. You‚Äôll have to train these abilities as you acquire them (or earn higher ranks of existing ones) by visiting class trainers located in the capital cities.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/thumb/spellbook01.png (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/spellbook01.png)<br />
<br />
At level 10, you‚Äôll gain access to class talents, which enable you to further customize your character. You earn a talent point with every level starting at 10, for a total of 51 points at level 60. Every class has three distinct talent trees, and you can spread your points among them as you wish, depending on your goals and play style.<br />
<br />
You can visit your class trainer to reset your talent points at any time. The cost for doing so increases every time you reset your talents, up to a maximum of 50 gold.<br />
<br />
If you need help figuring out where to spend your talent points, you can check out one of the many talent calculators created by the World of Warcraft community.<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/thumb/talenttree01.png (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/talenttree01.png)<br />
<br />
In World of Warcraft Classic, weapon skills are key if you want to perform well in combat. The more you use a specific weapon, the higher your skill in it will be, which has a substantial effect on your ability to hit your target. Each class is able to become proficient in specific types of weapons, and you‚Äôll need to visit a weapons master in your capital city to learn any weapon skills available that you didn‚Äôt start out with.<br />
<br />
Available Weapon Skills<br />
<br />
Bows<br />
Crossbows<br />
Daggers<br />
Guns<br />
One-Handed Axes<br />
One-Handed Maces<br />
One-Handed Swords<br />
Polearms<br />
Staves<br />
Swords<br />
Thrown<br />
Two-Handed Axes<br />
Two-Handed Maces<br />
Two-Handed Swords<br />
Unarmed<br />
Wands<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Resources<br />
Some classes require resources to cast specific spells or use certain abilities. Priests will need to purchase candles to cast Prayer of Fortitude, rogues will have to craft the poisons they apply to their weapons, and hunters will need to keep a supply of food specific to their pets to maintain their loyalty or risk losing them. And if your character uses a ranged weapon such as a bow, you‚Äôll need to keep a stock of arrows. <br />
<br />
Tip: Buffs don‚Äôt come cheap, so if you want to get a pocket healer to join you on your next adventure, you may just want to buy them a few supplies . . . out of the goodness of your heart, of course.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
<br />
https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/thumb/classic09.jpg (https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2019/august/classic09.jpg)<br />
<br />
In WoW Classic, there are nine primary professions to choose from, and characters can learn up to two of them at once. Blacksmithing, Engineering, and Leatherworking professions also have additional specializations that can be learned from trainers around the world. There are also three secondary skills, and all characters can learn all three.<br />
<br />
Primary Professions: Alchemy, Blacksmithing, Enchanting, Engineering, Herbalism, Leatherworking, Mining, Skinning, and Tailoring<br />
<br />
Blacksmiths can specialize in Armorsmithing and Weaponsmithing.<br />
Engineers can specialize in Goblin or Gnomish Engineering.<br />
Leatherworkers can specialize in Elemental Leatherworking, Dragonscale Leatherworking, or Tribal Leatherworking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Secondary Skills: Cooking, First Aid, Fishing<br />
<br />
Tip: Even a healing class can benefit from learning First Aid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Transportation: Getting Around Azeroth<br />
You‚Äôll need to get to know Azeroth‚Äôs network of flight paths, ship routes, and zeppelins in order to get around. Once you reach level 40‚Äîif you‚Äôve managed to accrue enough gold‚Äîyou‚Äôll be able to learn the riding skill and purchase your first mount.<br />
<br />
Tip: You can also befriend a mage or two to get a quick portal to key locations. If you do get a mage to use their talents on your behalf, it‚Äôs a nice gesture to give them a tip. Alternatively, you can also get summoned by a warlock (with the help of two other players) to another location. You‚Äôll need to be group up with either the mage or the warlock first.<br />
<br />
<br />
Grouping Up and Looting<br />
You‚Äôll want to group up with others to take on powerful foes or complete quests more quickly. While in a party, you‚Äôll get credit for shared kills, so everyone in your group can benefit.<br />
<br />
Your party leader will be able to set loot distribution to specific rulesets, including:<br />
<br />
<br />
Master Loot: The party leader determines who gets the loot.<br />
Round Robin: Each party member loots in turn.<br />
Group Loot: Party members can roll on powerful items.<br />
Need Before Greed: Only party members who can use the item can roll on it.<br />
Free-for-All: Anyone can loot anything.<br />
<br />
<br />
Make sure you establish loot rules with your group before getting too far into your adventure. If there‚Äôs a specific item you want or need, you‚Äôll want to understand how the group plans to handle distributing that item.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids and Dungeons<br />
<br />
<br />

Molten Core<br />
<br />
With the launch of WoW Classic, you‚Äôll be able to take part in some of the dungeons and raids that defined the game in its earliest days. That said, you‚Äôll need to find a few friends to join you first. The Looking for Group channel (/join LookingForGroup) is a great resource for finding players to group up with. If you want to summon them to your location, you‚Äôll need to add a warlock to your group‚Äîotherwise, you‚Äôll need to wait for them to make their way to you. If you travel to the entrance of a dungeon or raid, you can hover your mouse over the Meeting Stone outside to see the name of the dungeon and its level-range.<br />
<br />
While soulbound items generally aren‚Äôt tradeable among players, there‚Äôs a two-hour window from the time an item drops from a raid boss where you can trade it another player in your raid group, provided they were present when the item was acquired.<br />
<br />
This is just the start of your new adventure, and there‚Äôs a lot more to learn as you rediscover Azeroth. We wish you the best of luck‚Äîmay your blade never dull!</div></div><hr />

Was dial-up supported for WoW originally? I forget.<br />

I know even I had DSL (even if it was shit DSL that was only slightly better than dial-up), and that was in rural Georgia, which tends to be pretty far behind when it comes to Internet service options.</div></div><hr />

L2R. He doesn't like all of the Classic news. Maybe he needs to be nasty to get the attention of people though some of them have trouble reading.<br />
<br />
Why is this info released. I thought everyone new everything there was to know about Classic. Kind of redundant.<br />

I'd just prefer to not see news about a version of the game I won't be playing. Not trying to be hostile I just really don't care to see the news. There is a reason they made an overwatch and hereos of the storm site. Prior to MMO champ making those their own areas I was annoyed at scrolling through all of their news too because I don't play those games.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I know even I had DSL (even if it was shit DSL that was only slightly better than dial-up), and that was in rural Georgia, which tends to be pretty far behind when it comes to Internet service options.<br />
<br />
I first started playing with 24 kbps dial up. My mothers house in rural South Carolina still cannot get anything better. My grandmothers who is a few miles away can get like 3mbps or 6 mbps DSL or something like that. Still garbage. Companies like Century Link and the other big name companies care about building to new developments in cities with a high population density than building up the networks they have in rural areas that haven't changed since the 90s or early 2000s. <br />
<br />
I remember getting an ATT celluar card that used USB 2.0 and playing off of that and getting about 400 kbps. It was amazing being able to actually use youtube to listen to music while playing. This was fine in 10 mans, but sometimes in capital cities and 25 man raids I would disconnect. I actually lost my raid spot in Ulduar cause of it. <br />
<br />
Then I moved to a city to finish my bachelors and got a 25 mbps Time Warner connection. Oh, that was good as sex back in the day. And today, I get a 500 mbps fiber connection as an employee discount for working at an ISP and have more bandwidth than I can realistically use.<br />
<br />
Most amazing part was with 600 ms latency I would get to 1800-2100 in arenas and when I got my 25mbps connection I was able to get 2700 with about 200 ms. Ah, the days of having nothing in the world to do but be a mediocre college student and play WoW, drink, and party.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And yet the pro classic people in this thread behaves exactly the same. Reading your post, they are not the only ones whos insecure. Pro classic and pro retail, how silly it is to differentiate those &quot;groups&quot;, is behaving exactly the same. I tried classic prelaunch today and every 10 seconds it popped up &quot;bfa is fucking trash&quot; and other shit of retail being so bad in general chat. So whos childish, insecure and toxic?<br />
<br />
Some people will be toxic, no matter what they like or what they do. Stop pretending classic fans are angels. Just reading here on mmo-champion would tell you that both groups are behaving the same way.</div></div><hr />

and classic team worked for free yeah ? all the salary they got could have been put into retail as it should have. <br />
Classic is never gonna last. Blizzard won't allow it become more popular then retail because there is no money in classic. No tokens, no ingame shop, no character services. Bfa game licenses made more then 200 million euro day 1, thats not even counting all the racechanges, faction swaps, realm changes etc. and its counting people who bought a regular sub. all the people who paid with gold, thats a 25 euro token behind instead of the 10 something a sub cost. For classic to make that much money in day 1, they need like 15 million new subs the first day. And thats never gonna happen, they won't even get 1 million new subs thats not already subbed to the game.<br />
<br />
And if blizzard stay true to what they said, about fixing classes and go back on many of the changes they have done to classes, which is the main source of pain for most people now. 9.0 probably gonna outsell bfa day 1, and thats another easy 200+ million euro. So yeah. Classic with no other income then a sub, has no future and is not the priority for blizzard.<br />

Not entirely. For example, Ion Hazzikostas is game director for both. There's probably still a fair bit of overlap on the engineering side as both games are built on the same core game client and probably need to maintain some degree of version parity.<br />
<br />
Of course, Classic is Classic which means it doesn't take much from an art and design perspective.<br />

Yeah, it was supported. Widespread high speed internet really started growing nationwide in 2005, and really took off in 2008/10.

BFA is a bad, bad fucking joke. There is a pattern, every expansion gets worse lul, so you did get one fact in there I suppose. I just had to steer you into it like a tricycle.<br />
<br />
Maybe post in this thread again eight months from now and we'll talk about the state of the game, ok?<br />
<br />
and what exactly is false with any of what i said ? Bfa is bad, sure, still doesn't change the fact that it was the fastest selling wow expansion ever, and actualy one of the fastest selling games ever and it sold 3.4 mill, followed by legion who sold 3.3 mill. Those are factual numbers you can use to calculate how much it earned. So now, where is the falsehood and opinionated shitpost ?<br />
<br />
but i guess bfa bad, classic good yeah, classic gonna get 15 million subscribers and be more profitable for blizzard, even without the tokens, character services and game licenses ?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gadzooks</div><div class="date">2019-08-09, 08:44 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">and classic team worked for free yeah ? all the salary they got could have been put into retail as it should have. <br />
Classic is never gonna last. Blizzard won't allow it become more popular then retail because there is no money in classic. No tokens, no ingame shop, no character services. Bfa game licenses made more then 200 million euro day 1, thats not even counting all the racechanges, faction swaps, realm changes etc. and its counting people who bought a regular sub. all the people who paid with gold, thats a 25 euro token behind instead of the 10 something a sub cost. For classic to make that much money in day 1, they need like 15 million new subs the first day. And thats never gonna happen, they won't even get 1 million new subs thats not already subbed to the game.<br />
<br />
And if blizzard stay true to what they said, about fixing classes and go back on many of the changes they have done to classes, which is the main source of pain for most people now. 9.0 probably gonna outsell bfa day 1, and thats another easy 200+ million euro. So yeah. Classic with no other income then a sub, has no future and is not the priority for blizzard.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
don't think that has ever been confirmed. It was a theory some people had. Since mop was good, wod was crap. Legion was good, bfa was crap. it looks like a pattern<br />
<br />
I listened to the Activision-Blizzard investor's call earlier today (yes, it happened, and I'm kind of shocked the usual suspects haven't gotten a video up yet...Heelvs, you feeling okay?), and they mentioned specifically that they've added devs this year, across the board at Blizzard, to make more content, and release it more often, and used 8.2 as an example of what they think is how it should be. <br />
<br />
&quot;This is J. This is a question that teams really spend a lot of time considering on how to be successful, it is a priority for me personally. There is a high demand of Blizzard game content and it's a challenge we faced for a long time. I think we have made some headway over the years. At the same time, I think it's very clear that we could be doing better, and that was one of the driving reasons for us increasing the amount of developer talent at the company as well as really focusing on our priorities this year. Having more people in place to support the various initiatives that we have and the various features is really critical. It's the -- the process of iteration that we feel is really critical to us reaching the right quality levels.<br />
<br />
It's going to take some time to further ramp up on content delivery across our franchises. But we're happy with the early progress. We've seen significant new content for Hearthstone and for World of Warcraft just this quarter, and those are both very positively received by both communities. And ultimately, that's how we're thinking about Blizzard quality. Internally, we talk about craftsmanship and to us that's about meeting our expectations as well as the player expectations and both in terms of of frequency of content and in the level of polish. And so when we say that we're aiming to release more Blizzard game content for our players, it means that they can start to look forward to not just more Blizzard games, but more Blizzard quality game experiences across the board.&quot;(emphasis by me)<br />
<br />
And, it's been discussed by Ion and Brack that the Wow Classic team is it's own team, within the WoW overall team, and did not pull development from BfA - and why would it? They have all the art, the models, all they needed was to rebuild the databases, and the skills/talents, and you don't need hundreds of people to do that. And they mentioned that subs are UP, and they attributed it partially to the upcoming Classic release. No, they don't know how it will go, and Brack specifically told one of the investors that. But it's a gamble they were willing to take. Every mention of the Classic team has been that it's small - and none of the people working on classes and such for BfA would need to design classes - they're already designed. <br />
<br />
But here's what they had to say: <br />
<br />
&quot;And then World of Warcraft subscriber numbers have increased since mid-May, following the release dated announcement and beta for Classic and the Rise of Azshara content update in late June. The World of Warcraft team is focused on delivering substantial incremental content in non-expansion years has resonated with both current and lapsed players. The community excitement around Classic continues to build ahead of its August 27 release. Blizzard will be supporting release with a major awareness campaign for the large community of players, who have been a part of World of Warcraft, over the last 15 years.&quot;(emphasis by me)<br />
<br />
So, even discounting happy joy investor stroking...they're seeing growth for BfA AND Classic. Huh. Imagine that. And, before you start - and I know you are - they can't lie to investors. They usually haven't mentioned sub numbers in the last couple of years, so it's notable that they used &quot;subscriber numbers&quot; specifically and not MAUs. They have to be able to back that up with actual sub numbers, if the investors push hard enough. <br />
<br />
I get that you WANT Classic to fail, for your own (and suspectly selfish) reasons, but can we stop with the &quot;they're taking dev time away from retail!&quot;, please? And this 15 million subs stuff to pay for it is just silly, and you made it all up. They're stating point blank that a sub is a sub, regardless of what game they play, and they're not going to &quot;hold back&quot; Classic, because there's nothing to hold back. They're not sure how it will do over time, Brack made a point to say that in the investor call, but they still thought it was worth doing, and figured out how. It is what it is, it's coming, get over it. <br />
<br />
(I can't wait for the reaction to Brack &quot;You think you want it, but you don't&quot; saying &quot;Classic is something that's really close to my heart.&quot;) (it will be a shitshow, obviously)<br />
<br />
(BTW, profits are down, but they outperformed expectations, and had a lower operating margin, so more store mounts are in coming. It's working. Something like that. But the stock price went up, nobody is getting fired, so...just another Thursday, but i know the usual suspects will gnash their teeth over it tomorrow, and Asmondgold will restream it all for easy clicks)</div></div><hr />

This is all fine and dandy, but you cannot deny that they simply earn too much money in selling new expansions to just stop and focus on classic, which was my original point. Classic is done, they won't work more on it. It will get a few more subs, but thats that, When it comes to wow, the income is from the store, tokens, character services and expansion sales.</div></div><hr />

I can't agree more, people saying wotlk was best make no sense to me. Everyone forgot where their cc button is in dungeons, it was just aoe spam until everything dies. Tanks could keep threat with any aoe ability... No skill required at all. Burning crusade was the best expansion.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it is. But at the end of the day. At day 1 of the bfa's release, they still had sold 3.4 million copies. That is a lot of money. Now ofcourse i don't know how much it cost to develope bfa, but im sure they made a rather nice profit, and that has been my original point since way back in a few other threads. Classic was probably not too expensive to make, but the income for that game will never be high enough for blizzard to restart wow and focus on classic rather then retail.</div></div><hr />

Classes are super limited in uses and the game has a ton of inconvenience around it. Longtime players will probably become annoyed because they are used to modern convenience's and players who weren't there(esp of the younger variety) will probably not be able to bear the pace and super slow rewards. I don't think classic is overtaking retail, that's absurd. In fact within a year its either super niche or only played by the most hardcore of people. That is my prediction. Classic will be hard to sustain, especially with its demands of players and especially when Blizz announce the next xpac. As a player who lived it from beginning to Naxx, all I can say is good luck! Especially to those who weren't there and are going in thinking its &quot;all that&quot;...... surprise, its not. Rude awakening inc.</div></div><hr />

How much do you really think it'll cost to keep Classic running compared to Live? Classic players are doing Live players a favor by subbing for $15 a month. If they truly keep Classic they way they say it'll be, then they can put the vast majority of the money they bring in, aside from needing to hire people for customer and technical support, into the live game, since there will be virtually no development costs for Classic.</div></div><hr />

Classic is never gonna last. Blizzard won't allow it become more popular then retail because there is no money in classic. No tokens, no ingame shop, no character services. Bfa game licenses made more then 200 million euro day 1, thats not even counting all the racechanges, faction swaps, realm changes etc. and its counting people who bought a regular sub. all the people who paid with gold, thats a 25 euro token behind instead of the 10 something a sub cost. For classic to make that much money in day 1, they need like 15 million new subs the first day. And thats never gonna happen, they won't even get 1 million new subs thats not already subbed to the game.<br />
<br />
And if blizzard stay true to what they said, about fixing classes and go back on many of the changes they have done to classes, which is the main source of pain for most people now. 9.0 probably gonna outsell bfa day 1, and thats another easy 200+ million euro. So yeah. Classic with no other income then a sub, has no future and is not the priority for blizzard.<br />

don't think that has ever been confirmed. It was a theory some people had. Since mop was good, wod was crap. Legion was good, bfa was crap. it looks like a pattern<br />
<br />
You do realize that blizzard nets $20 for every sub gained from a token right? People that use tokens to pay their sub actually participate in a system that makes blizzard more money. And there is something called &quot;segmentation&quot;. Classic WoW earns revenue therefore it can offset the cost of the developers and servers. Each &quot;segment&quot; has its own budget based on projected revenue.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im fully aware that gold subs are worth double, which i wrote in the comment you quoted. But what you talk about in segments and revenue per segment, People paying with gold need to do that in retail, no tokens in classic. So where does that revenue go ? playing in retail to be able to buy a sub to play classic. Which segment does that money go to ? So with this logic, The only money that should go to classic, is the subs being paid in full and never log into retail.</div></div><hr />

It won't &quot;fail&quot; because the costs to make it were probably so low. They can probably recoup their investment after a single month of 100k subs or even less.</div></div><hr />

Ah, moved to the next stage of grief I see.<br />
<br />
I guess it's not going to fail anymore, but it existing will bring profit for Blizzard and they can &quot;recoup their investment&quot;..<br />
<br />
...Blizzard is going to do far more than just &quot;recoup their investment&quot;...and I think that's very obvious for anyone paying any attention at all. <br />
<br />
The amount of resubs that Classic will cause will be extremely high initially based on various factual things, like the fact most stress-tests, actually intended for heavy-player-load, have all had major stability issues... which means that Blizzard will need to invest in more hardware for Classic before launch. <br />
<br />
I like the fact that we have moved past the &quot;Classic is going to fail&quot; and &quot;Classic is all nostalgia&quot; phase of discussion...and we're now at the &quot;Classic will be a little successful, at least enough to prevent any damage&quot;<br />

Same here! thanks for beta-testing the game for us! We have things like anti-cheating software now with 10+ years of development from the old game and the same tech as the old game! so Classic is likely going to do incredibly well this time around since that is the case! Can't wait for BC and TLK too, those will be awesome!<br />

What are you even talking about? What is your problem? People on the classic forums misrepresent anything you say and it's seriously annoying. Grief?? No I'm not &quot;grieving&quot; anything.

They are scared that &quot;retail&quot; is going to die off. Pro tip...It already is . BFA is straight up garbage. And since 8.2 is going to last till Late January or March , more people are going to leave it . There is just nothing fun to do in 8.2 now<br />

Yes it was. My wife and I traveled for about 6 months during the vanilla era. There were several places we stayed that I could only use dial-up to login. I learned to stay out of highly populated areas if I was using it. But it was absolutely fine for leveling/questing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
on the note of one being better (or for that matter, another expansion being better, TBC and Wrath get thrown around a lot) while it does make perfect sense depending on a persons experience in an expansion that one might resonate more, be careful of how nostalgia impacts the argument. I personally came in with classic, and have great memories of it, so I am excited to play through it (and show my wife it, she humors me well but was never into wow so it would be new for her) but that makes it easy to overlook negatives. <br />
<br />
I see a lot of posts about current wow being casual, and this is a return to when it wasn't, but remember one of the original draws to classic when it was new that it wasn't as hard core as some of it's competition, that it had a streamlined quest system, you could get progress on crafting and your character without months of farming for basic items (end game quests not withstanding, and even then it was not that bad) the draw was it was accessible to more casual players.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying that made it always easy, but a lot of the challenge was the lack of knowing how the game worked, resources, fight guides, etc. Anyone that played then spent a lot of time just figuring things out, there wasn't an easy way to just look up where to go and how to do something, for most players it was through word of mouth (I mean eventually we had Thottbot SP? but even then it wasn't wowhead). To be fair that was part of the fun, an unsolved world where even incorrect information could be true (like finding a purified Ashbringer), but also I don't feel it is fair to paint it as people back then were awesome and people today are casual, few of us, myself included, knew much about how the game truly worked, learned through trial and error, and felt accomplished figuring something out that today would be something that was just expected of the person to know.<br />
<br />
TLDR: goals change over time, experience changes over time, but as long as it's enjoyable it might be better to focus on that and building the community instead of what set point in time is best.</div></div><hr />

Actually, it's not. The classic team is entirely made up to support classic and any hiccups it might have, this is also the reason why the Classic development team is having a &quot;War room&quot; for release in order to tackle any issues that may pop up. <br />

I know this is way over your head, but if you actually bothered to read some of the blue posts that come out instead of going &quot;Nuh uh! This ain't happening&quot; then you'd realize why they would have to hire new animators for 14 year old models.</div></div><hr />

There is no speculation on my end, the only one trying to shift goalposts and say &quot;Oh yeah, but they didn't hire new X specifically!!!&quot;, would be you.<br />

How are you not speculating? You don't work there, so everything you're saying is literally a guess...and a bad one at that. There is one WoW team. To appease you I will note that yes there are multiple &quot;teams&quot; within the WoW team, such as Level Design, Game Design, Quest Design, Raid Design, Character Art, Enviromental Art, Prop Art, Dungeon Design, Concept Art, Animators, Storytellers, producers, engineers, tools, programmers, and so much more. Are you that dense that you can't realize that classic wow literally has no need for most of those?<br />

You know what you've been told which amounts to virtually nothing, everything else you say is just a guess based on what you've been given.</div></div><hr />

How is it not speculating, you ask? Because I'm going by officially announced facts, unlike you. <br />
It's not a guess, they literally hired new people for a seperate team to work on Classic and speak of them as a separate team from the ones working on Live, making it clear that the efforts would not take people from the established live teams from the very start.<br />
<br />
That's a fact no matter how much you want to believe differently. The only one speculating here, and based on nothing to boot, is you. The official word &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yours. <br />

<br />
&quot;This endeavour is being undertaken by an entirely separate team at Blizzard from the one working on World of Warcraft and its next expansion. That‚Äôs great news for players who don‚Äôt care about revisiting the past but are much more interested in Warcraft‚Äôs future. &quot;We‚Äôre going to hire people specifically for this job, and we‚Äôre going to staff it with people who are interested in bringing back Classic WoW in the best, most authentic way,&quot; Brack says. &quot;And that‚Äôs how we‚Äôll be successful.&quot;<br />

That's a fact no matter how much you want to believe differently. The only one speculating here, and based on nothing to boot, is you. The official word &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; yours. <br />

<br />
&quot;This endeavour is being undertaken by an entirely separate team at Blizzard from the one working on World of Warcraft and its next expansion. That‚Äôs great news for players who don‚Äôt care about revisiting the past but are much more interested in Warcraft‚Äôs future. &quot;We‚Äôre going to hire people specifically for this job, and we‚Äôre going to staff it with people who are interested in bringing back Classic WoW in the best, most authentic way,&quot; Brack says. &quot;And that‚Äôs how we‚Äôll be successful.&quot;<br />
<br />
From Brack himself. <br />

Suck it up, buttercup. I'm not sure what you were hoping to prove here, but you've literally been wrong all along yet acted as if you weren't. GG you.<br />
<br />
So when the credits come out for Classic in a couple weeks be sure to compare them to BFA. It's going to be funny watching you eat your words, don't worry I won't forget.</div></div><hr />

*sigh*<br />
<br />
They're not my words, that came from Brack himself, you just refuse to acknowledge it.<br />
As for the credits, stands to reason that they'll go back as far as to the original names that first put out the game, seeing as how it's a rerelease of their work, with some credits given to the team that worked on the new release.<br />
<br />
Makes perfect sense, not sure what words you expect to be eaten here.</div></div><hr />

Load up classic and compare them, you can do it now. How do you like your Crow?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ohoho, there is no crow being had on my end, as much as I'm sure you're taking great delight in deluding yourself to thinking that.<br />
<br />
The credits literally list the regular leads at Blizzard for everything that wasn't needed for Classics rerelease, and entirely new people for the things that they did need done, which then shows in the credits list. <br />
<br />
Example 1: Dungeon Artists: New for Classic credits: Luis Armstrong-Torres. <br />
And so on. <br />
<br />
Exactly as per the words of Brack himself, they hired new people to put Classic out.<br />
And there's even a bar that shows the credits for the original as it came out, as predicted. It's a tad greedy of them to not just feature the new names that worked on this rerelease of Classic in the credits, but I'm sure there's some legal matters behind that decision. <br />
<br />
If there had been zero differences, they would've been caught in a lie, and why risk that when they can just do what they set out to do? Which they did. <br />
<br />
Enjoy YOUR crow, God knows you've earned it.</div></div><hr />

You're not even arguing the point anymore...of course there are going to be a few new names to the list. But all the other names are almost exactly the same with a few minor changes. After the layoffs the dev team was expanded and more people were hired in every department. You're just can't handle being told that you're wrong so I'm going to go ahead and assume you like your crow Medium-rare like god intended.</div></div><hr />

:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I am arguing the point, you're simply not capable of understanding it, which is why you're still deluded and thinking you're correct. <br />
<br />
Like I said, again: Check the names, for everything that was needed to put out Classic, there are NEW names, even new categories. The rest are the same simply because of legal matters, not because all those people literally worked on Classic's re-release.<br />
<br />
There is no crow being had, things have gone down exactly as Brack said. They hired new people to put out Classic, and those new names are shown in the revised credits. Since I'm sure you're still going to refuse to see the facts, I'm putting you on ignore now. It's literally a waste of time arguing this with someone more concerned with being able to say &quot;told you so!&quot; than with the actual facts of the matter. You were wrong, Brack's word holds more water than yours.<br />
<br />
What a shocker. But not really. Have a nice day.</div></div><hr />
