Blizzard Takes Seattle at PAX West - Legion Panel Live Stream<br />
It looks like we might hear more about Patch 7.1 at PAX West tomorrow. <br />
PAX West takes over Seattle, Washington again this year from September 2–5, but you don’t need to attend to get in on some of the action.<br />
<br />
Panel Live Stream: World of Warcraft: Legion – The Invasion Continues<br />
<br />
Sit back and enjoy a hot mug of coffee or steaming cup of tea in the comfort of your own home, and catch our Legion panel stream live from Seattle here on the World of Warcraft site—no umbrella required. World of Warcraft developers Luis Barriga, Cory Stockton, and Eric Maloof will be on hand to talk Legion and discuss the next chapter in its evolution.<br />
<br />
When: Saturday, September 3 from 1pm–2pm PDT<br />
<br />
Where: Live stream here on the World of Warcraft site, or in person at PAX West in the Wyvern Theater<br />
<br />
Visit the Blizzard Booth<br />
<br />
If you’re in Seattle and far from your home computer, don’t worry—you’ll be able to visit the Blizzard Booth 425 in the Expo Hall to get in some quality time with Legion and hang out with our helpful Blizzard staff.<br />
<br />
If you want more streaming action, then make sure to catch community content creator Swifty, who will be streaming live (https://www.twitch.tv/swifty) from PAX West during the show hours all weekend long direct from the Blizzard Booth.<br />
<br />

<br />
Commanding Shout should no longer grant more than the intended bonus when combined with other effects that increase health.<br />

Items<br />

Equippable items from Legion dungeon treasure chests should match your class proficiencies.<br />

<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Reaves Module: Snack Distribution Mode (http://www.wowdb.com/items/132529-reaves-module-snack-distribution-mode) no longer requires feasts.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Experience earned from gaining Honor has been reduced by approximately 50%.<br />
<br />
Developer’s note: We want battlegrounds and skirmishes to be a worthwhile and rewarding activity while leveling, but that should not be the most efficient method for gaining XP. While we've decreased the experience from PvP, it is still more efficient than it was in previous expansions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Fixed an issue where faction transfers would interfere with Death Knight's ability to complete the Class Hall quest &quot;The Firstborn Rises&quot;.<br />
Fixed a bug causing players who died during the sequence of Dalaran's teleportion would get stuck in Deadwind Pass.<br />
Paladins should now be able to progress with their Class Hall Campaigns after completing the quest &quot;The Scion's Legacy&quot;, by speaking with Lord Maxwell Tyrosus.<br />
Teensy Weensy Fae Dragons should now appear more frequently during the quest “Teensy Weenies!”.<br />
<br />
<br />
Artifact<br />
<br />
Rogue player should no longer sometimes experience issues using their Smoke Bomb during &quot;The Unseen Blade&quot;.<br />
Players should no longer be erroneously placed in a phase in Deadwind Pass that makes them unable to complete quests in the area, including &quot;Following the Curse.&quot;<br />
Hunters completing to quest to obtain their second or third artifact should no longer receive the quest &quot;Hunter to Hunter&quot; after turn-in.<br />
The points of interest for the Warrior quest “Legacy of the Icebreaker&quot; are now displaying correctly and the stage objectives update appropriately.<br />
<br />
<br />
Azsuna<br />
<br />
Daglop should no longer disengage with the player, allowing “Minion! Kill Them!” to be completed normally.<br />
During &quot;The Right Weapon for the Job&quot;, shipwrecked captives in the Shipwreck Arena clubhouse should no longer glow as if they’re viable targets for the quest.<br />
Players who leave the area and return during the “The Scythe of Souls” should be able to complete the quest.<br />
Players entering the Nor'danil Wellspring in Azsuna should no longer be incorrectly queued to enter the Withered Scenario in Suramar.<br />
Players should no longer fail to loot several quest objects in the Nar’thalas Academy during quests such as &quot;Study Hall: Combat Research&quot; and “Dressing with Class”.<br />
<br />
<br />
Highmountain<br />
<br />
The bungee rope attached to the player should no longer disappear during the quest “Going Down, Going Up”.<br />
Mayla Highmountain should no longer leave combat and reset the Wrath of Dargrul boss fight during “The Underking”.<br />
On “Murlocs: The Next Generation” and “Oh, the Clawdacity!”, Murky’s abilities no longer affect other players in PvP. Gurrullrurlll mrrrgrglru ruluulll.<br />
<br />
<br />
Stormheim<br />
<br />
&quot;Waking the Shieldmaiden&quot; now has a correctly-placed location dot on the map.<br />
<br />
<br />
Val’sharah<br />
<br />
Fixed a number of issues with the &quot;Defend The Temple&quot; Bonus Objective in Val'sharah.<br />
<br />
<br />
UI<br />
<br />
Obelisk of the Void should appear in the Dungeon Journal for all ranged damage dealers and healers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Zones<br />
<br />
Orgrimmar, Stormwind, and previously invasion-affected areas should once again be unified for single realms.<br />
<br />
Developer’s note: On RP servers, we’re setting sharding and cross-realm zoning back to how things were working before the Burning Legion invaded. This had been changed for stability during pre-launch events and invasions.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
World Quests &amp; Cross-Realm Grouping<br />
We’re currently tracking an issue that can cause players to “lose” World Quests when grouping with other players cross-realm. Correcting this issue is a top priority for us, and we’re working hard on a fix, but wanted to share some workarounds for this issue in the meantime.<br />
<br />
You can tell if you’re experiencing this issue by checking the quest tracker (which, by default, at the right side of your screen. If you don’t see the World Quest there, it’s not currently active for you. You can re-activate it by doing one of the following:<br />
<br />
<br />
Logging out and back in to that character <br />
Running a fair distance away from the World Quest area and then back <br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, if you plan to join a cross-realm group to do a World Quest, you can avoid this issue by joining that group before you arrive at the World Quest area. Note that this issue only occurs when using cross-realm grouping.<br />
<br />
Again, we’re hard at work on a fix for the issue, but the above workarounds should allow you to complete World Quests properly until that fix is in place.<br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Legion Auction House<br />
We are discussing adding an Engineering Auction House to Dalaran, much as it was in Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
<br />
I'll update this thread with any more information I hear on this. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/758774-please-add-auction-houses-to-legion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20748836407?page=3#44))<br />
<br />
Dalaran Underbelly Guards<br />
When people signed up for PVE server we were under the impression that PVP will be purely optional. From what I can tell bodyguard doesn't always work.<br />
<br />
Bodyguards are bugged. Once they're fixed its a non issue unless 5g is too steep.<br />
We've seen reports of this, just a heads up that we are looking into issues reported with bodyguards in the Underbelly. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/758507-i-dont-understand-the-underbelly-issue/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20748876394?page=3#45))<br />

PvP<br />
I still don't understand how you get gear from pvp or what item level it is and what you do to get higher item level gear.<br />
not happy with the transparency on this. Getting fixed in 7.1. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/770253937517531137))<br />

I guess this means they're disabling sharding for capital cities, but does it also mean they will go back to being just people on that server? Or are they keeping the cross-realm capitals?</div></div><hr />
