With the release of Battle for Azeroth on August 14, players will begin their journey toward bringing two new Allied Races to the fold: Mag’har orcs and Dark Iron dwarves (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21701413). You’ll earn their loyalty through the expansion’s War Campaign and will need to meet the following requirements to add their might to your faction:<br />
<br />
<br />
Reach level 120<br />
Become Exalted with the key subfaction from your side’s War Campaign:<br />
<br />
Alliance: 7th Legion<br />
Horde: The Honorbound<br />
<br />
<br />
Complete the War Campaign in Kul Tiras and Zandalar and earn the Achievement Ready for War (Ready for War) (both Horde and Alliance).<br />
<br />
<br />
There’s plenty of ground to cover in Battle for Azeroth, and it all comes down to where you’ll focus your efforts first.<br />
<br />
Uldir Awaits<br />
<br />
Millenia ago, seeking to understand the nature of their eternal foe, the titans constructed this sprawling underground facility to research and quarantine captured specimens. They hoped that by studying the void energy that bound the Old Gods, probing it for weaknesses and reactions, they could find some way to neutralize it. They were horribly, horribly wrong. The facility was sealed away so that the horrors within would never be unleashed upon Azeroth. But now those seals have broken. . . .<br />
<br />
Raid Bosses: 8<br />
Difficulties: Raid Finder, Normal, Heroic, Mythic<br />
Level: 120<br />
<br />
September 4 – Normal and Heroic open<br />
September 11 – Mythic, Raid Finder Wing 1: Halls of Containment (Taloc, MOTHER, Zek’voz, Herald of N’zoth)<br />
September 25 – Raid Finder Wing 2: Crimson Descent (Fetid Devourer, Vectis, Zul, Reborn)<br />
October 9 – Raid Finder Wing 3: Heart of Corruption (Mythrax the Unraveler, G’huun)<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth: PvP Season 1 – September 4<br />
<br />
Ready your swords and boards: the new PvP season is on its way. Battle for Azeroth PvP Season 1 kicks off September 4 with new rewards and two new Arenas — Hook Point and The Mugambala. Read about rated PvP updates and rewards here (https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/21881588/) and prepare to leap, blink, sneak, or charge your way into the action.<br />
<br />
Battle for Azeroth: Mythic Keystone Dungeon Season 1 – September 4<br />
<br />
We’re adding a new layer to Mythic Keystone Dungeons with the introduction of Mythic Dungeon seasons that align with the latest content and rewards. As a part of Season 1, we will be introducing using a new seasonal affix—Infested—which will appear on level 10 or higher Keystones. The Infested affix reflects the extent of the corruption of the blood god G’huun as it seeps out into Azeroth to infect select denizens of each dungeon. With each new season, we’ll be changing out this third affix to keep players on their toes. How will you deal with these new dangers?</div></div><hr />

Edit: Yes I realize the achievement won't happen the first day, the point is we won't need to wait for a patch (which could take longer than the achievement).</div></div><hr />

It'll be probably impossible to finish all the requirement in the first day to be honest.<br />
<br />
Complete the War Campaign in Kul Tiras and Zandalar and earn the Achievement Ready for War (both Horde and Alliance).<br />
<br />
And that &quot;both Horde and Alliance&quot; looks odd...</div></div><hr />

That is to unlock both of them.<br />
the post is mentioning as if you wanted to get both.<br />
So you will need to do the faction campaign on horde and alliance, you cant just do the horde one if you want both allied races.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah blizzard said awhile back to unlock stuff like that you would not need to do the other faction, people were confused when path finder required loremaster from both factions, but blizz commented &quot;nope you will not need to do horde to unlock stuff on alliance, that is simply how the achieve works that it shows whatever for your faction&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well if you are able to hit 120 and get exalted and finish achievement on the first day, you DO deserve to get it...</div></div><hr />

Awwww ... can you share your feelings with us on why? I'm pretty sure Blizzard asked about you specifically. Also, bonus points for asking about a date for 8.1 release, as there is a rumor that Ion from Blizz is personally reaching out players who ask about this to let them know when it is safe to play the game.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you just suck at getting your point across?<br />
When you say get hyped we get them day one, that makes it look like you think you can make one on release day, sorry you feel attacked when corrected.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Correction wasn't needed, it was clarification. Also don't feel attacked,if you give an attitude prepare to receive one. Sorry I assumed the average person was smart enough to understand what I meant. Quite simple, really.</div></div><hr />
