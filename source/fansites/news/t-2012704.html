Legion - Dev Q&amp;A Today<br />
Check back later today for the first weekly Legion Dev Q&amp;A! We'll be recapping it for those of you unable to watch. <br />
As we announced on our blog, we’re starting up a series of Live Developer Q&amp;As taking place every Thursday at 11 a.m. PT for the next several weeks. You’ll be able to tune in live at Twitch.tv/Warcraft (http://twitch.tv/Warcraft).<br />
<br />
You can submit your questions via Twitter by using the hashtag #LegionQA, or simply by replying to this forum thread. For our first session, we’ll be talking with Assistant Game Director Ion Hazzikostas, and there are no restrictions on topic—as long as it’s related to the Legion expansion, fire away!<br />
<br />
Please keep in mind that we want to make sure we get to as many questions as possible, so try to keep it short. We’ll only consider questions that use 40 words or less.<br />
<br />

Raid Testing Schedule - June 17-20<br />
On Friday, June 17, and Monday, June 20, we will continue our Legion raid testing.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires 20 and does not scale.<br />

As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the bosses being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
<br />
Demon Invasion Event Test June 16-17<br />
With thanks to all testers who participated in our demon invasion Beta test last week, we're going to have another.<br />
<br />
On Thursday, June 16, starting at 10:00 a.m. PDT, we will activate a demon invasion realm in the Legion Beta. This Beta realm will be dedicated to testing the pre-expansion demon invasion event with as many testers as possible for approximately 24 hours, and we expect to remove the realm after 24 hours have elapsed.<br />
<br />
We ask that all Beta testers please join us in focusing testing on the demon invasion realm when it is available. Other Beta realms will not be available during this 24-hour test.<br />
<br />
Please direct your pre-Legion event feedback to the Beta General Discussion forum, and please direct any feedback you have about other Legion subjects to the appropriate dedicated subforum.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much! We’ll see you at the defense of Azeroth!<br />
<br />
<br />
Current PTR Content Available<br />
Hello PTR Testers,<br />
<br />
Currently the PTR does not have Demon Invasions active, and Broken Shore and the follow-up quests are disabled as well; this is intended. This content may be enabled at a later time as testing progresses.<br />
<br />
The important things that you can help us test out (feedback and bugs) on the PTR realms right now are things like:<br />
Transmog Changes and the Appearance Tab Spell and Talent Changes PvP and Honor Changes Other System Changes like Class Specializations and Glyph System Engine Changes (New System Settings and Graphics Options) <br />
<br />
Also if you haven't yet, check out the PTR Patch Notes for more info!<br />
<br />
<br />
PTR Character Copy<br />
The Character Copy button is present in the current PTR build and characters from your retail account are listed, but we're still working to get the copy process finalized so you'll likely run into &quot;Copy Failed&quot; errors.<br />
<br />
We're working on resolving this but I don't have a current ETA to provide. I'll provide updates as we continue work on this.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blood of Sargeras Sources<br />
Blood of Sargeras (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/124124-blood-of-sargeras) is a BoP Legion crafting reagent. There aren't many ways to earn it outside of gathering and occasional world quests, but that is changing. <br />
Hi friends - I just wanted to chime in that in the next beta build you should see more Blood of Sargeras dropping from non-tradeskill sources (dungeons, in particular).<br />
<br />
<br />

Court of Stars and Class Hall Campaigns<br />
So are warriors still going to have their class quests need these dungeons. If so, this seems poorly thought out. Mythic groups usually have Ilvl requirements, and seeing as the gating of the class quest will prevent us from having the third relic slot it will put us behind a little. Honestly I'd rather that the normal dungeons open up at an early rep, and where the quests need you to do something it requires heroic/mythic instance to complete and those modes be tied to higher difficulty.<br />
Class Order campaign quests that currently send players into Suramar dungeons are being changed to target different dungeons - that should be visible in the next build. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/413994-court-of-stars-requirements-and-tuning/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20744874839?page=7#122))<br />
<br />
Polymorph and DoT Removal<br />
Ok as a mage you use poly to reset fights, I literally CANNOT do that now as a fire mage, because I can't wipe the dots I constantly place on the target with so many spells.<br />
Actually, Polymorph should remove all damage over time effects when cast on targets in PvP. We've changed all crowd-control abilities that break from damage to clear damage over time effects when applied. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/414174-for-the-love-of-polymorph-fix-it/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745065450?page=1#15))<br />
<br />
Legion Beta Blood Death Knight and Holy Paladin PvP<br />
At the moment Hpals barely heal, they just run in pop wings and top the meters while keeping their group alive. Blood Dks on the other hand are simply immortal gods that deal way too much damage in particular with heart strike criting sometimes for over 700K.<br />
Much of the blood DK damage was coming from the Honor talent &quot;Blood for Blood&quot; which we've toned down in an upcoming hotfix, and the talent will no longer remove the rune cost from Heart Strike. The idea of the talent is to give Blood DK's an option to increase their damage at the expense of a survivability loss (most tank specs have an honor talent similar to this), it was just overtuned.<br />
<br />
As for Holy Paladins, the honor talent &quot;Avenging Light&quot; was probably too good now that Holy Light heals for so much. We've toned that one down too, which should be live now.<br />
<br />
Thanks for the feedback! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/414171-unable-to-properly-test-pvp/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745075609?page=1#14))<br />
<br />
Focused Testing - Player Collision<br />
Greetings all, as you continue testing World Quests we would like to put a special focus on areas of player collision. These can often be some of the most frustrating issues to run into on day 1 of the expansion's launch, as I'm sure we've all experienced the line to kill the one boss or loot the one item you needed that wasn't flagged for multi-tap.<br />
<br />
This includes, but is not limited to:<br />
<br />
Single kill targets that are not multi-tap. Objects that are not multi-loot. Too few spawns of a type in an area. Too slow of a respawn time for spawns in an area.<br />
<br />
Please let us know if you run into any of the above issues on a World Quest, thanks! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/414240-focused-testing-player-collision/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745225851?page=1#1))<br />
<br />
Kirin Tor World Quests<br />
There are a few issues with the Kirin Tor world quests, we're on top of them, they won't be fixed in today's build but should be by the next one. Thanks for all of the reports! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/414138-kirin-tor-emissary-bonus-no-world-quests/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745115418?page=1#10))<br />
<br />
Quest In the Blink of an Eye<br />
This looks to be working properly after restarts!<br />
<br />
Please re-try this if you were having problems earlier. You might need to drop the quest and pick it back up from Khadgar's Elemental Servant (re-log if he doesn't pop up immediately). Then just run to the middle of Dalaran (over Karazhan) and you'll be on your way to New Dalaran!

Quest 'The Fallen Lion' is Broken<br />
We're looking into this as well, apologies for the delays it causes.<br />
<br />
We're continuing to investigate into why this is broken on Beta Realms. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/414183-quest-the-fallen-lion-is-broken/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20745085860?page=1#15))<br />

<br />
No more so than any other legion spec. There is hardly anything complicated about any now including the new Demon Hunter. <br />
<br />
BM Hunter can be a lot more active than people make it out to be. Taking Chim shot helps a lot of course. But what I've noticed as gear increases so does the amount of dire beasts you have out and you can easily go back to filling in gaps with cobra shot which feels close to how it used to be. I don't even notice it anymore, I wanna say that I became fully adapted roughly halfway to 110. And actually something I did this week is switched to AMoC for doing world quests. Making sure to time that right so you get the reset on every mob adds something to do as well.</div></div><hr />

Of course it will be. So they can avoid any hard questions. :) <br />

<br />
A: We found increasing the size didn't make content quicker it just made more content.<br />
Q: Where is this content? Legion has one of the lowest sets of dungeons and raids and have the least amount of content for pvp. <br />
A: Um. We have some exciting stuff planned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
they made a fantasy movie in general and a warcraft movie specifically for the fans. the viewership is a tough crowd and such a big title for gamers and such a small title for every non-gamer.. you cannot tell me that they estimated 1bn. if they would have gotten 50 million and nothing more, the movie would be a failure and nobody would push for a sequel. but they did something greater and opened the door to much more.<br />
<br />
the sequel will probably have more time to develop story rather than the put-it-all-on-one-card approach of this movie.</div></div><hr />

You realize movies run for longer than just one week right. Also the movie has yet to come out in a dozen countries.</div></div><hr />

Nope. The point of having an herbalist/mining is to save time, because you're going to run around to harvest stuff (without flying) and being able to harvest herbs AND mining deposits instead of looking at the mine and telling yourself &quot;I'll come back later with the other character&quot; is an immense time saver.<br />
<br />
The BOP Blood decision was made without a clear vision of what was intended, and little anticipation of its consequences, which the team is now trying to untangle.<br />
<br />
For instance, it is the first time ever that two professions are interlinked in the same character. Prior to that, any BOP component for a profession was either made by the same profession, or obtained completely outside of professions. If you needed something from another profession, you had the AH because it wasn't bound. &quot;Take whatever professions you like!&quot; seems to be the motto, and they even spent a lot of time at one point trying to make sure you didn't had &quot;mandatory professions&quot; due to perks. Which they later removed. Here, while there are &quot;some other sources&quot;, the primary source of BOP components for a crafting profession is a gathering profession. Which makes it almost required for any character to couple a crafting profession with a gathering one.<br />
<br />
Now, with all the &quot;fantasy of the class&quot; (or profession) talks from Blizzard, about why &quot;feels right&quot; is important for them, this one does NOT match a fantasy of professions. First of all, it's not required that my leathercrafter has skinning. He can have herbalism for all I care, the only thing he needs from the gathering profession is the BOP Blood. The rest can go straight to my alchemist for the potions. In fact, I can have an alchemist/skinner and a leathercrafter/miner and a smith/herbalist. None of the combinations make sense individually, but the end result perfectly works.<br />
<br />
Of course, let's not forget the two professions that don't have an associated gathering: tailoring + enchanting. In fact, since enchanting benefits from getting cheap crafted from tailoring to disenchant, and tailoring uses dusts from enchanter to make advanced cloth, both professions could be said to be each other's gathering, and it's no surprise they are often together on the same character. But you cannot make, say, the disenchanting process drop randomly rare bloods or have tailors make bolts from cloth scraps and randomly proc some blood. Because that would allow said enchanter/tailor to purchase mats at the AH, craft, and make as much Blood as needed at any one point &quot;without spending time in the world harvesting&quot; (which I assume is half the reason why it's so, the other being &quot;cut the RMT Botting for gold from AH&quot;). So that's not a solution. Yet, no gathering profession make sense AT ALL to couple with those two. Exit profession fantasy #2.<br />
<br />
I can go on, but the above show clearly that this late decision had too many consequences, and Blizzard is probably going futilely to now try to &quot;fix&quot; the problems they caused in the first place until they come to realize that, if they did not want people to sell Bloods on the AH to keep Obliterum rare (or whatever reason they suddenly discovered this late in the beta), they have a perfectly adequate solution: make the bloods BOA. It's still not a good &quot;fantasy&quot; of crafting, but it's a thousand times better than &quot;oh, and by the way, tailors should pick herbalism for this expansion at least, and they'll probably be able to go back to enchanting in the next expansion which is not going to use that stupid mechanic anyway&quot;.<br />
<br />
(yup: we're asked to entirely reshuffle our profession setup for this expansion, and it's almost certainly not going to matter at all in the next)</div></div><hr />

Says who, though? The usual formula for 'break even' is double the production cost, so it's closer to 300m than 500m.</div></div><hr />
