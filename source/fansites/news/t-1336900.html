Patch 5.4 - Visions of Time: Hidden Threads<br />
Patch 5.4 adds a quest line on the Timeless Isle that involves working for Kairoz (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/72870-kairoz) of the Keepers of Time (http://wowpedia.org/Keepers_of_Time). He is on the Timeless Isle because the Bronze Dragonflight is not as powerful as it once was, only being able to catch furtive glimpses through time. He has created an hourglass that will allow for a window into the timeways, but you must collect 50 x Epoch Stones (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/105715-epoch-stone) to make it usable. <br />
<br />
After collecting the stones, you embark on a series of weekly quests to use the Vision of Time (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/105930-vision-of-time) in different locations to calibrate the Vision of Time. Kairoz eventually will reveal (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/33376-seeking-fate) that there is a traitor among the Bronze Dragonflight.<br />
<br />
As the hourglass grows more powerful, he will send you to the Siege of Orgrimmar to look at one of the most devastating timeways you can find, which is the scene you see below. This uses the damaged Stormwind Harbor (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNkl8yB1tYw) area we posted a few weeks ago.<br />

Patch 5.4 Developer Interviews<br />
The Starting Zone (http://thestartingzone.com/post/58931613345/episode-63-developer-interview-with-wow-technical) recently had a chance to interview Marco Koegler (Technical Director). You can find information from previous interviews on our Patch 5.4 Developer Interviews page (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1345).<br />

New Player Models<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't ready to show off any of the new player models yet, but hopefully will have an announcement soon.<br />
One of the human models was changed six years ago and there was a large uproar over how the eye blink changed.<br />
Changing the player model risks causing players to no longer feel attached to their character. <br />
Upgrading player models has never been done successfully in an MMO.<br />
<br />
<br />
Game Engine<br />
<br />
The engine is about 12 or 13 years old now, but has been improved constantly.<br />
For a long time it was mandatory to maintain the same visual look across all hardware, but recently they have diverged from that idea, allowing the team to do some nicer things at the higher end. <br />
The last two expansions increased the minimum requirements on the boxes, but the team still tries to support the hardware from older minimum requirements.<br />
Switching to another existing engine wouldn't make a lot of sense, as the WoW engine has been optimized for certain things that aren't supported well (or at all) in off the shelf engines. For example, moving to an engine that used more dynamic lighting and bump mapping would also require reauthoring most of the existing textures that have been created over the years. This would take a very long time and come at the cost of new content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
There was a bug at the Mists of Pandaria launch that made it harder to interact with objects the longer you raided, which is something that the developers noticed during their own play time and were able to fix.<br />
The systems have been improved to where downleveling your character to play with a friend that is leveling is technically possible, but there aren't any announcements to make.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria Story<br />
The debate over faction story development continues internally here at Blizzard, as it does on the forums and elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Any chance we can get more updates on that debate? We get constant updates on gameplay mechanics from Ghostcrawler and other CMs about their thoughts and feelings, but we only rarely hear things from Kosak and friends. It'd be very helpful if they started talking to us and telling us what they're hearing, because right now it seems like there's a really big communication gap. <br />
It's something we're working on. I'd love to set up more story-centric interviews and conversations with the community. But, while Dave and Greg are both design leads, it's very difficult to compare their tasks, workloads, and roles within the community. <br />
<br />
Systems design is extremely complicated, but it revolves primarily around math. It's easier to have a conversation over class balance concerns and walk away with some objective, actionable feedback. We also try not to change classes too dramatically from patch to patch -- we don't want people logging in and suddenly not knowing how to play their class every time they download a new patch. Greg can talk about general changes early on in a patch's development cycle, and then he can take feedback and look at an array of statistical data we collect in order to finetune numbers closer to the patch's release.<br />
<br />
Story development works very differently. Concerns are much more subjective. This isn't to say they're inherently less valuable, as we're always taking careful note of what the popular opinion is on a given topic. But, there's often a degree of complexity to story development concerns that certainly can't be addressed by changing a couple values somewhere in the game code. And the story we want to tell, combined with the gameplay we want to introduce, is determined much earlier on in development than what class balance will look like in patch X. <br />
<br />
For example, there are several people in this thread asserting that the entire concept of the Siege of Orgrimmar is flawed from a story perspective, particularly for the Alliance. Well, we knew Siege of Orgrimmar would be the final raid of Mists of Pandaria before the expansion was revealed at BlizzCon 2011, and the story framework for how we'd get there was already more or less in place. So, even when we do react directly to feedback about story concerns, we're looking much more at the big picture here, and what stories we want to tell and how they should unfold over the course of several patches (or even expansions). <br />
<br />
We can make some tweaks and refine some story arcs along the way, but regardless of the discussions taking place right now, the 5.4 story is set. It has been for quite some time. That's in big contrast to the aspects of systems design that draw the most discussion (i.e. mainly class balance).<br />
<br />
So, tying this back to the varying capacities in which Dave and Greg engage the community, I couldn't be very liberal with Dave's time when it came to booking interviews. I found about an hour of his time (hour and a half if you count that I stole part of his lunch break) and sat him down for back-to-back interviews -- in, out, and done in one swoop. The reason being that his role in the development of a patch happens at a very different stage of the cycle. At this point he's not actively reading PTR feedback and tweaking how the Horde and Alliance are responding to the threat of Garrosh, or deciding to rework the conclusion of the siege. It's way too late for that, and he's already very busy working on the stories yet to unfold in World of Warcraft. And, yes, in that space he takes popular feedback to heart.<br />
<br />
Dave Kosak... I just don't know anyone more passionate about this game's narrative, or more burdened with the responsibility of making sure that the story is fun to play through regardless of the faction, race, or class a player chooses. He cares deeply about you feeling personally invested in what you're doing, and whether you're red or blue certainly doesn't change that.<br />
<br />
All this being stated, I want to add more words to this post. <br />
<br />
Part of my role on the WoW Community Team is fansite/influencer relations, which includes booking developer interviews. I've been on the team for six years, but I took on the role of fansite relations shortly before Mists of Pandaria was released. Not counting things like PAX or other press events, I've been responsible for booking developer interviews for five press rounds (5.0-5.4). Each time I experiment with the formula by trying to cover different formats, give different sites or people a chance to talk to the devs, etc. <br />
<br />
Looking back on the last five rounds to determine how we can improve the process and results going forward, I'll tell you right now that I'm most interested in bringing story discussion more to the forefront of interviews -- including WoW devs like Dave Kosak, as well as folks from Creative Dev like Chris Metzen and Micky Neilson -- and getting our artists involved more regularly, 'cause you don't hear from them enough. And finally, while I understand the importance of having a mix of text, audio, and video formats, I want the developers on camera more. I believe strongly that the more you get to see and hear the individual behind the name, the better!<br />
<br />
My friends and I have a running joke. If you're a Monk leveling through Pandaria (or a Pandaren for that matter) it's a bizarre experience, because no one recognizes you. They treat you like as much as a freak as everyone else. Now, obviously its unreasonable to ask to have different quests. But it's the bare-bones minimum to ask to see different text when chatting with NPCs.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the joke: &quot;We don't see many of your kind around here, Monk,&quot; says the Pandaren surrounded by Monks. We use it as slang for when something small catapults you out of immersion in a game. So, I have read and understand your words, but...eh. No one's perfect and WoW is huge, but c'mon. <br />
Hah! I know what you mean. And I bet if you sat down with Dave to talk about that over a spot of tea, you'd find that those types of things bother him as well. <br />
<br />
In all, Mists of Pandaria has a plethora of good examples where we implemented content in new ways to avoid immersion-breaking moments like that. But we're definitely not perfect, and we have to weigh the time/resources it takes to address an issue like the one you recounted, versus working on other things. I know some people hate seeing such an excuse, but the truth is it's a very real challenge we face everyday. Game development on World of Warcraft virtually never stops. In general, every task has to be looked at from all angles so an accurate estimate of time and resources can be made, before the task is green-lit and prioritized among all others.<br />
<br />
Using the issue you noted as an example, we have to ask ourselves questions like, &quot;Do we want to make sure Pandaren questing in Pandaria have a lot of unique VO and quest text, or do we want to design a rich gameplay experience on the Isle of Thunder in patch 5.2?&quot; That's not literally what it came down to, but sometimes the choices are that stark.<br />

Battlefield: Barrens Ending Soon<br />
Will the Radical Mojo be BOA / BOE after 5.4 or not.<br />
No. As the armor tokens and weekly quest are going away, Radical Mojo won't be obtainable once Patch 5.4 hits. However, as we've stated before, Gahz’rooki’s Summoning Stone, Raptorhide Boxing Gloves, and the Kor’Kron Supply Satchel can still be found on the Kor'Kron mobs in Northern Barrens.

Scaling up Old Dungeons and Raids<br />
I think you might be referring to this interview (http://youtu.be/9ckHhcp7mvo?t=11m7s) with Vanion (http://www.vanion.eu/). We still need to find an appropriate reward scheme for the scaled up content though, so feel free to share your eureka moments, might help out our devs and eventually speed things up a bit, as Tom said, we won’t be seeing this happen until some point in the future.<br />
<br />
I don’t know about you guys, but personally, this news is so exciting that I think I’ll be running faster than usual for a while.<br />
<br />
To me it spells good news, even though it could be considered &quot;recycled content&quot;. It'd be nice to give these older things more attention and bumping them up to the level cap seems to be the right way to go.<br />
I see it as a chance to make all that incredibly rich and awesome “lost” content relevant once again.<br />
I always felt it was a tiny bit disheartening to see such well-designed dungeons that used to be the “crème de la crème” of past expansions, end up being skipped by most new players. I mean, new content should still be the main focus and the most rewarding, but if we can revive it in a way that it does justice to what that content once was and to the challenges that it used to represent, then I think it can come out as awesome fresh new experiences for new players and at the same time provide a much higher diversity of content at max level for everyone else.<br />
<br />
New content is great but “new” is such a fleeting thing… I think diversity is just as important as freshness. More available dungeons = less chance to get bored. We’ll see how this goes (if/when this comes out), but I’m sure I will enjoy it no matter what, can’t wait to run some of my favourite dungeons once again at max level, and there are so many of them!<br />
<br />
I also like the challenge of trying to solo older raids, but I guess that's just me.<br />
Please take this is with a grain of salt, but I believe the current idea would be to still preserve the option to run content at their originally designed level if the player wishes to.

Patch 5.4 - Echo of Elements<br />
One of the complaints about Elemental Shamans has generally been directly linked to the procs coming from Echo of the Elements. Because of the recent change to Echo of the Elements on the PTR, you should not be too concerned for any minor increases to the damage of Lava Burst as it will no longer be chain-casted onto you in PvP. We do still appreciate any of the feedback that you have on the 5.4 PTR. <br />
<br />
You can see the change to Echo of Elements here (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/blog/10158897/54_PTR_Now_Live_%E2%80%93_Updated_August_20-28_08_2013#shaman):<br />
Echo of the Elements' spell duplication effect can no longer occur more than once every 4 seconds when used against hostile players, and their pets or guardians.

I´d say so. This is just a lazy excuse of Blizz to somehow calm the players down because how could you expect new models of no other MMO did it successfully?<br />
<br />
So it takes them ages to create new models because Blizz fears the special snowflakes? Would you guys rather play as a misshaped Human or a good looking one? Ok it could happen that your favorite hairstyle is no longer available, so what? You then choose another one.</div></div><hr />

In that recent interview they said that they are comparing the old models with the new ones all the time because they fear the player´s reactions on the new models.<br />

Why do they have that much fear? They could just implement a button that allows some stupid players to keep they're old models while everyone else gets fresh new ones but NO &quot;We don´t want to upset our players :(&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I think the reason they're even entertaining it, is so they can keep saying they dont want to upset people to get the good guy award. Probably will never get released with the rate at which the subs are going :/<br />

<br />
Didn't... didn't Runescape do it... 3 times?<br />
<br />
upgrading the whole engine technically counts as a model update... right?<br />
Firstly, I think they meant one of the big MMOs. Despite Runescape being &quot;the largest browser-based MMO in the world&quot; and having around 537k paying customers, it really isn't in the same category as WoW.<br />
<br />
Secondy, - technically. RS has done this only once - from RSC to RS2. Armour model update is not a player model update (WoW has new models of armour too, they just don't update the older ones) and RS3 does not include any model update afaik, this is, I think, coming with the HTML5 version, which is still in Beta... Other engine updates, that Jagex so often mentions, are more along the line of what WoW does with every expansion... Also, they are keeping all the old versions, RSC is still running today, despite being updated 9 years ago, HTML5 client won't replace the Java client, they will coexist on the same live servers...<br />
<br />
Also you could argue if any of this was successful, because every time this is done, tons of people hate it. I, for example, despite not being &quot;one of those&quot;, am still not used to the new armour models, despite it being already 1.5 years since they were updated. The difference between RS and WoW in this matter is that in WoW, you don't use the old armours, except for the graphics, while in RS, even high level players sometimes use lower level armour (e.g. Rune Plate, Guthan Full) because of its lower cost compared to the high end armour.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Changing the player model risks causing players to no longer feel attached to their character.&quot;<br />
So somehow I can relate to my &quot;character&quot; because his armor hides his/her body's current model. But I can't fall in love somehow with a new model hidden under the exact same clothes...<br />

Under this assumption I should hate all new races and other MMO characters. Because they are different, and in fact probably more detailed than the last.<br />

<br />
Shadows of Luclin came out, character models were updated. Don't like it? No problem!<br />
Open the options, go to the right interface and just click the checkbox....per race.<br />
<br />
So players could have updated humans and elves with original model trolls and ogres if they wished. They could have all new, all old, or any mix of the two they wanted. And that's what they'd see for ALL models of that race.<br />
<br />
Promotional art and screenshots showed the new ones, of course, but if a player particularly disliked it the OPTION was there to use the old ones and it worked quite well. It also allowed players on older computers to turn them all off to use original models and lower the performance demand on their PC.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What happens when Tier 23 comes out and the old troll models have helm clipping issues, and the old human, blood elve, and worgen models all have their shoulders sitting two feet above their bodies? How many resources do they need to put into fixing that? If most people use the new models, do they just leave the old models broken? And speaking of that, how much dev time should they put into QA for both old and new models wearing all the various equipment in each expansion/tier? In three more years, they'll have to spend double the amount of time developing and testing equipment to make sure the the old models wear everything correctly, even though a small minority would still be using them. That's resources that could be spent working on a new dungeon or raid.</div></div><hr />

So the numbers in the next expansion will rise so dramatically that they will require a transition from 32 bit to 64 bit? That is the part I don't get. Actually the blue post that concerned the item squish had no information in it other than &quot;approaching a database limitation&quot;, so it is hard to really understand the problem and it very much seems like a lame excuse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Item squish is more work than not doing the item squish. They have to go back to all the old raid content and items from TBC -&gt; MoP and balance them all down. This is not an easy &quot;lets just do 60% across the board&quot; fix. Because it takes so much time and resources to do this, I''m not sure how you are interpreting this as &quot;cheap and lazy&quot;.<br />
<br />
2) I want to say (this I will admit I'm not 100% sure) that they:<br />
<br />
a) are really just looking at their main recent MMO competitions, such as Aion, SWTOR, guild wars 2, rift, etc, whenever it comes to &quot;successfully in an mmo&quot; and<br />
<br />
b) They have mentioned time and time again that they are making these changes very, very, very carefully to not turn-off any of the community as much as possible. That's not lazy/cheap. Let's say they have already done 20-30 different models for humans, each one a tad better than the previous. Until they get the model right, the rest of the animations will have to wait, which is more future work. To you their process might look like &quot;ok I like this new model, let's choose this model.&quot; but it's not as simple as that. <br />
<br />
c) Their definition of success might be different than what we think. Just changing the models isn't a success. Maybe changing them all with minimal complaints and ppl threatening to leave the game if they dont change back is a bit more successful, don't you think? And what about this: What if they did just the perfect job on these models so that this makes players want to come back to WoW that have been gone for a long time? Isn't that even a bigger success than the previous 2 examples of &quot;success&quot;</div></div><hr />

If they make dramatic changes to WoW models I'm sure some would be okay with it. They might even like it more. But, we should all know that it could potentially cause many thousands of players to be upset and even cause them to quit. This may seem ridiculous, but it will happen.</div></div><hr />

I think they need to make the graphics engine less cpu bound and put more of the load on the video card before they worry about upping graphics quality. Not even a supercomputer can run the game at 60 fps with all options at max because of how their engine works and the fact that the game can't even utilize more than 2 cpu cores.

When they say models have never been updated successfully, they mean without ANY player of that game complaining about them. How hard is that to grasp? And hey, guess what, they're right. People even complained a lot about the Everquest model update, which many of you are so quick to point out. Runescape made an entire sequel to update models and not everyone loved those either.<br />
<br />
So yes, Blizzard are correct in saying that no MMO has ever updated models successfully.<br />
Most of you are only complaining because they mentioned they were actually doing them just before MoP went live. You'd not have batted an eyelid about the models if they hadn't mentioned them. I've seen people say they will come back to WoW for new models despite leaving the game because they hated it. Logic doesn't work well with most WoW players, current or ex.<br />
<br />
And considering this &quot;fan&quot; base that WoW has, I'd want to take my sweet time to get them done right too.</div></div><hr />

People say Everquest did this, but I haven't played/followed that game at all.<br />
<br />
EverQuest 1 did successfully update every player model when Luclin came out AND gave people the choice between newer and older models. Developers will never satisfy 100% of the playerbase with any changes made to the game, so &quot;success&quot; can't really be gauged in that manner unless the models are universally hated.

I came here to say this. The Blizzard fanboys trying to spin it so that it takes every single person to be happy with a change for it to be considered &quot;successful&quot; are delusional. If that's the standard they want to go with then I guess WoW is an abysmal failure, huh? The EverQuest team did a phenomenal job with the new player models, and allowing players to choose which models they used at the time was genius. Why Blizzard refuses to give credit where credit is due is beyond me.</div></div><hr />

Me, I've grown detached from the entire WoW game because I keep playing newer games that show me just how outdated WoW is graphics wise. Yep, 12-13 year old engine, and the player models are the exact same age. I got tired of hiding my character in armor that was just as ugly, a bunch of blocks and polygons that had texture painted on them like some old PS1 game. I played Undead, and while the blocky painted armor might have hid some things, I still had to see the rectangle bones and low-resolution fingers/toes poking out of the boots and gloves.<br />
<br />
Update the game, and forget the people that are attached to such old graphics. Make it free to play, I'd be back. $15 a month for such an aged game though? Nope.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So it takes them ages to create new models because Blizz fears the special snowflakes? Would you guys rather play as a misshaped Human or a good looking one? Ok it could happen that your favorite hairstyle is no longer available, so what? You then choose another one.<br />
Runescape and Everquest both have successfully updated player models without fuss, just off the top of my head. <br />
<br />
I think the longer they wait, the bigger peoples' expectations get, and the more likely players will be disappointed or unhappy. They ought to at least just show us what they've got like they did with the druid forms. Give us a bit of what to expect now, so we don't keep building the hype only to have it inevitably dashed later.<br />

Yeah, no. You may have been playing EQ but you certainly weren't reading the forums then or now if you never saw the enormous drama over the model update. Not only do I think Blizzard was not ignoring EQ, but that it was the foremost example in their minds of a poorly received model update.<br />

There was a time, not long ago when Blizzard liked being the first to do things. Instead of just copying other mmo's and giving bull shit excuses, they actually innovated. These ghosts they're referring to that will be upset that their hair lip is gone are exactly that, ghosts. They don't exist. In fact, I'd say the majority of the population will see the new models, go &quot;oh hey that's cool&quot; and then never think about it again because most of the time your gear covers everything up anyways.

The majority of players liked the models. A large portion of those who didn't like them simply never turned them on. Some drama on a forum isn't going to change that.<br />
No change made to an MMO has ever made 100% of the playerbase happy. You said yourself that the majority didn't hate them. That's the definition of success in the MMO world. <br />

Who fucking cares really<br />
<br />
Even in the most perfect scenario, there is going to be people who will dislike, despise &amp; hate change or new stuff regarding the whole universe let alone a multiplayer game. I can guarantee you right here and now, that when we finally get new models, there's going to be so much trash talk about how bad they are and that everyone wants the old ones back that the official forums are going to explode. <br />
<br />
It's been that way since forever, but the love &amp; hate camps are about equally big, the biggest of the camps however is those who don't give a shit if there's old or new models, but would welcome a change to high fidelity, not demand it, but welcome.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Daniri</div><div class="date">2013-08-30, 02:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah I'm sure your reading of a forum makes you an expert on all things Everquest. <br />
<br />
If only we were talking about all things Everquest this might have been a worthwhile sentence. The question is whether there was backlash against updated models and don't try and change it to anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
On the flip side, the other half have been playing with their characters for up to seven years. Having a different skin, different eye shape, or even different body frame may perturb them. Back in 2001 Everquest launched Everquest: Shadows of Luclin which included the “Luclin models” which were a new set of character models (including armor). Many players felt that the changes were unwelcomed and ruined their game which is why players now have the ability to switch between post Luclin and pre-Luclin models in Everquest.<br />
<br />
This is a game that over 10 years ago implemented this change and players, to this day, can be found arguing on the various message boards about which is better. Same say the blocky pre-Luclin models are far superior to the non-blocky post-Luclin models while others find the improved graphics to actually be an improvement. There is no clear victor in an argument of perception, but we can see how serious this subject is.<br />
<br />
This is the truth. Every time there's been a discussion about updating WoW models over the years, someone invariably brings up Luclin as a cautionary tale. If you don't know that, if you haven't seen that, then you shouldn't be having this discussion. You aren't aware of the context.</div></div><hr />

New Player Models<br />
•Blizzard isn't ready to show off any of the new player models yet, but hopefully will have an announcement soon.<br />
•One of the human models was changed six years ago and there was a large uproar over how the eye blink changed.<br />
•Changing the player model risks causing players to no longer feel attached to their character.<br />
•Upgrading player models has never been done successfully in an MMO.<br />
<br />
Game Engine<br />
•The engine is about 12 or 13 years old now, but has been improved constantly.<br />
•For a long time it was mandatory to maintain the same visual look across all hardware, but recently they have diverged from that idea, allowing the team to do some nicer things at the higher end.<br />
•The last two expansions increased the minimum requirements on the boxes, but the team still tries to support the hardware from older minimum requirements. (WE aren't running on XP machines anymore with 32bit OS) come on....<br />
•Switching to another existing engine wouldn't make a lot of sense, as the WoW engine has been optimized for certain things that aren't supported well (or at all) in off the shelf engines. For example, moving to an engine that used more dynamic lighting and bump mapping would also require reauthoring most of the existing textures that have been created over the years. This would take a very long time and come at the cost of new content.<br />

&quot;Upgrading player models has never been done successfully in an MMO.&quot;<br />
<br />
There was a time, not long ago when Blizzard liked being the first to do things. Instead of just copying other mmo's and giving bull shit excuses, they actually innovated. These ghosts they're referring to that will be upset that their hair lip is gone are exactly that, ghosts. They don't exist. In fact, I'd say the majority of the population will see the new models, go &quot;oh hey that's cool&quot; and then never think about it again because most of the time your gear covers everything up anyways. I play zoomed out as far as I can when I raid so I don't even remember what my character looks like.<br />
<br />
completely agree with this.</div></div><hr />

I hated those models. Many people I played with hated them too. When I first read the interview I immediately agreed with him and thought about how terrible EQ1 did it.<br />
<br />
If they make dramatic changes to WoW models I'm sure some would be okay with it. They might even like it more. But, we should all know that it could potentially cause many thousands of players to be upset and even cause them to quit. This may seem ridiculous, but it will happen.<br />
<br />
It's also funny that shitloads of people actually liked them in EQ, also upsetting a few thousand players and so what?, they have 5 million + players and i bet the main part of those either A) don't give a shit and B) Casuals that just go with the flow of the game so it will not affect them anyway.</div></div><hr />

When they say models have never been updated successfully, they mean without ANY player of that game complaining about them. How hard is that to grasp? And hey, guess what, they're right. People even complained a lot about the Everquest model update, which many of you are so quick to point out. Runescape made an entire sequel to update models and not everyone loved those either.<br />
<br />
So yes, Blizzard are correct in saying that no MMO has ever updated models successfully.<br />
Most of you are only complaining because they mentioned they were actually doing them just before MoP went live. You'd not have batted an eyelid about the models if they hadn't mentioned them. I've seen people say they will come back to WoW for new models despite leaving the game because they hated it. Logic doesn't work well with most WoW players, current or ex.<br />
<br />
And considering this &quot;fan&quot; base that WoW has, I'd want to take my sweet time to get them done right too.<br />
Oh god I never believed that anyone can be that wrong at all. If just 1 person complains about something in WoW then the game would be a fucking failure and you know it. There won´t be anything in any game that does not cause at least a few guys to complain on the internet.<br />
<br />
&quot;When they say models have never been updated successfully, they mean without ANY player of that game complaining about them&quot; <br />
<br />
So just shut down WoW because in this case the game has been a massive failure because with every new stuff they added there were a lot of people complaining on the internet. Stuff like new tier sets, new races, new content had a ton of complaining people and every new stuff they will add in the future will be the same.<br />
<br />
Sure if Blizz would add new models there would be a bnuch of people whining but EQ1 did that successfully because they added a feature that allowed you to choose between old and new models. That was a long time ago and you guys tell me that Blizz can´t do that in 2013 ?? I thought they were a fucking billion dollar company with a lot of great devs?</div></div><hr />

<br />
As in they werent forced on anyone. And you had to manually toggle them on to begin with. Which is probably a far better way to do it than what blizzard will do.<br />
<br />
OK, seriously. What's the hurry?<br />
<br />
Sure Blizzard can put out decent ones and leave them toggle able so people won't get pissed. But why settle for that?<br />
<br />
They are trying to make full on replacements that feel the same as the old models but are of higher quality. Why not let them try?</div></div><hr />
