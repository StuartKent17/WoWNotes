Below is a small recap of the Q&amp;A of the Class Discussions panel. <br />
<br />
Casters will finally get a Legendary item in one of the first raids of the expansion.<br />
Cataclysm will change the ways abilities are learned. Abilities ranks are gone and ability will just scale progressively with levels instead. <br />
Most of the Talent Trees will be changed dramatically, a lot of the passive bonuses will be removed and talent trees should be more fun. (No more &quot;Hurray! Level up! I just got 1% more hit!)<br />
There is no plan to allow players to train more than 2 profession. <br />
There is no plan to allow more than 2 specs with the dual-spec system.<br />
Bags might get slightly bigger with Cataclysm. <br />
You will never be able to cleanse the Corrupted Ashbringer.<br />
Developers want shaman to be good AE healers and might buff Chain Heal even more. <br />
Multi-passenger flying mounts could be added in the future. They might also allow crafters to craft 310% flying mounts if they already completed an achievement rewarding one. <br />
Every healer class can now dispell magic, the niches will other debuffs.<br />
Engineers might be able to craft bows in the future.<br />
If you already own a 310% mount, you might be able to boost the speed of all your 280% mount to 310% just to let you use the one that you prefer. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter <br />
Hunter's new ammos might drop from bosses or bought with emblems, nothing is decided for the moment. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest<br />
Shadow Priests will most likely get a nuke without cooldown in Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
Shamans (Elemental) looks like &quot;turrets&quot; in PvP for the moment, the idea is to make totems funnier in the future (&quot;put a totem down and something cool happens&quot;) but not a lot of details for the moment.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior<br />
Warriors won't be as affected as other classes by the itemization changes, the goal is to make other classes gears look a lot like what warriors have. <br />
<br />
<br />
Class Discussions Panel<br />
The recap is now complete, I also added a few parts from Wryxian's Recap on Official Forums (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/10543537977-blizzcon-09-classes-items-and-professions.html) where he did a much better job than me. <br />
Archaeology<br />
Archaeology is the new secondary profession that will be joining the ranks of cooking, fishing, and first aid in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm. Archaeology allows the player to unlock new abilities and rewards by discovering ancient treasures throughout the world. Each archaeologist uses the profession to uncover clues hidden in the world around them, such as troll relics or map fragments, and decipher their meaning, enabling the clever archaeologist to manipulate pieces of the past, learning the location of a treasure cache or valuable artifact. Such artifacts are highly sought after by the Archaeology Society, and they pay in gold and items for their return. Those who have mastered archaeology can find Titan artifacts, earning special currency used to unlock character paths and allowing the player to further customize their character. <br />
<br />
Reforging<br />
Reforging is another way to customize your gear.<br />
It will be relatively cheap, you will need a Blacksmith / Leatherworker / Tailor / Jewelcrafter / Engineer to do it. Each profession get to reforge a type of items. <br />
It lets you reduce one stat for another. Some restrictions will apply, you can't put the extra stat on something that is already on the item. <br />
<br />
Professions<br />
Multi-gains will be added, while you level up your trade skills, rare items will give you more points as you skill up. (Rare items will give you 5 points for example, while green bracers will only give one)<br />
Gathering should be a little more fun.<br />
Engineering is a very fun tradeskill, but it's either amazing or it sucks and everybody drops it. More convenient items like Jeeves or Wormhole Generator will be added to the profession in the future to get back to the roots of Engineering. <br />
Fishing will also have some big changes, no details yet but it's going to be more fun. <br />
<br />
Itemization<br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, there are plans to streamline the statistics found on items. We want to remove all unnecessary stats, make all existing stats understandable, and make all &quot;core&quot; stats more appealing. Here are some examples of such plans.<br />
<br />
MP5: This will be removed from items and replaced with Spirit. All healers will be given a meditation-like ability.<br />
Spell Power: Spell Power is being removed from items as well. Don't panic, we'll be improving Intellect so that it provides mana and Spell Power.<br />
Attack Power: We're removing Attack Power from items as well. Instead, we're allowing Agility to provide the necessary Attack Power for leather and mail wearers. Strength will provide the appropriate amount of Attack Power for plate wearers. This means leather and mail items will no longer be desirable for plate wearers.<br />
Defense: The Defense statistic is also being removed from items so that players no longer have to worry about juggling around &quot;the cap.&quot; Tanks will receive the necessary anti-crit from talents, like Survival of the Fittest.<br />
Armor Penetration: This ability is too confusing and &quot;mathy.&quot; It is being replaced with Mastery, a stat that makes you better at what you do. More on that later!<br />
Haste: Will also increase the rate at which you gain energy, runes, and focus. Retribution paladins and Enhancement shaman will have a talent that allows them to take advantage of this benefit.<br />
Block: Block Value is being removed. Blocking will now always mitigate a percentage of damage.<br />
Stamina: Players will notice more Stamina on gear as Defense, Spell Power, Attack Power and Armor Penetration are removed. <br />
<br />
Legendary Item<br />
Shadowmourne - You won't get Frostmourne in Icecrown but Death Knights and Hunters will get a Legendary Axe named Shadowmourne. <br />
<br />
Goblins<br />
Rocket Jump - Activate your rocket belt to jump up to 20 yards, every 2 min<br />
Rocket Barrage - Fire your belt rockets at an enemy within 30 yards, every 2 min. (Shared cooldown with Rocket Jump)<br />
Time is money - Cash in on a 1% increase to attack and casting speed. <br />
Best Deals Anywhere - Best possible gold discount, regardless of reputation.<br />
Pack Hobgoblin - Calls in your personal servent, allowing you bank access every 30 min.<br />
Better Living Through Chemistry - Alchemy skill +15, Your potions give more health / mana<br />
Goblins can be all classes except Paladin or Druids<br />
<br />
Worgens<br />
Darkflight - Activate your true form, increasing movement speed by 70% for 6 sec, every 3 min.<br />
Viciousness - Increase damage by 1%.<br />
Abberation - Reduced duration on Curses and Diseases used against you by 15%.<br />
Flayer - Skinning skill +15, you skin creature fast, and you don't even need a knife. <br />
Worgens can be all classes except Paladins or Shamans<br />
<br />
Worgen Form<br />
The Worgen Form is cosmetic only<br />
out of combat you can pick between Human or Worgen. <br />
In combat you will be a worgen.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ihunters.gif Hunter <br />
Hunter's mana is GONE!!!<br />
Hunters now use focus, no longer care about intellect or mana regen. <br />
Focus regenerates contunously, Steady shot improves the rate of getting focus bag.<br />
Rogue energy comes back at a 10 / sec rate, Hunter focus comes back at 6/sec (12/sec with steady shot) <br />
A shot costs 30 to 60 focus. <br />
Hunters will have fewer cooldowns on abilities<br />
Ammos will become an item, not a consumable. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock<br />
Soul Shards are no longer in your bags. The goal is to make them fun, not a hassle.<br />
Soul Shards will be integrated to the user interface. (Just like Death Knight runes)<br />
You get three shards per fight, they will regen very quickly out of combat. <br />
It will be possible to get more for long fights or mistakes through Drain Soul.<br />
Soul Burn (New Spell) : Cost 1 Shard, 30 sec cooldown, off the GCD. Empowers your next spell, many (not all spells) behave differently when empowered.<br />
Empowered Searing Pain : Next 3 Searing Pains crit<br />
Empowered Summon Demon : Instant Cast<br />
Empowered Soulfire : Instant Cast<br />
Empowered Fear : Instant Cast<br />
Empowered Death Coil : Longer Horror, more healing received.<br />
They are only used in combat, summons or demons won't use your shards. <br />
&lt;a name=&quot;classpictures&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;<br />

Mana/5 sec is gone. Spirit now regenerates mana. <br />
All healers will get a Meditation like skill. (In combat regeneration)<br />
Mages and Warlocks won't have to deal with Spirit on their gear anymore.<br />
Spell Power is also gone. Intellect now provides mana AND Spell Power<br />
Hunters and Enhancement Shamans won't have to worry about intellect anymore<br />
Attack Power is also gone. <br />
Agility now provides 2 AP for rogues, hunters, shaman, and druids. Plate-wearers won't steal your gear anymore!<br />
Defense is gone. No more juggling around the cap. Tanks will receive the needed anti crit from talents (Survival of the Fittest)<br />
Armor Penetration is gone. It was too confusing and is now replaced with a mastery. <br />
Mastery makes you better at what you do. (more on this later)<br />
Haste now increases rate which you gain energy, runes, rage, and focus. <br />
Talents for Enhancement and Retribution will make this work.<br />
Block value goes away. A block mitigates a percentage of damage. It is now a real mitigation stat. <br />
With No Defense, Spell Power, Attack Power = more Stamina for all. <br />

WOAH JUST WOAH :D<br />

out of combat you can pick between Human or Worgen. <br />
In combat you will be a worgen.<br />
<br />
<br />
abit confused here &gt;&lt; can u see plate armor for example on worgen form or just runing naked as wolf ? :D</div></div><hr />

Sounds to me like they are making things a whole lot simpler to understand and less of a theorycraft to know exactly which items are better for you and which are not. I hope Retribution ends up no longer needing to worry about mana (much as the Enhancement Shamans).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Some classes all they really cared about, at their core, were maybe 2 stats. Take holy paladins for example (obviously some favored more stats than others), it became a game to see just how much Intellect we could stack in our gear. Sure, you didn't want to gimp your other stats but most of the gear we had access to came with all the crit/haste/mp5 you could handle. It's not entirely uncommon to see holy paladins in some of the Uld-25 hardmode gear/AT gear and have mana pools in excess of 40k. One such paladin on my realm sits at approx. 44-45k 25-man buffed but sh!t for mp5 --- I think unbuffed he sits somewhere around 70.<br />
<br />
A lot of specs have been headed in this direction, so it makes sense for them to push all classes in that direction as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Anyone else read the word &quot;Itemization&quot; above the list of stats being &quot;removed&quot;? Your items (armor, weapons, etc) aren't going to carry those stats any more. You're still going to have Attack Power, Spell Power and all that. Jeez. Last I checked, your stat sheets aren't items.</div></div><hr />

Anyways I guess Blizz can do a &quot;cataclysm&quot; like event every few years (when they run out of ideas, like the LK xpac) so they can change lots of stuff and still make it feel like its wow.<br />
<br />
still lookin forward to the new changes, *fingers crossed it goes well*</div></div><hr />

-- I think I fun little thing that I would like to do come back to these panel notes closer to release to what made it and what didn't. Remember none of these items are promises from blizzard. I look at this list as more of a wish-list and brainstorming. A good many will be in game but their numbers and how they are described now can change.</div></div><hr />

There you go. That's all. Everying else, GONE!<br />
<br />
<br />
Although you're forgetting about:<br />
Spirit<br />
Agility<br />
Strength<br />
Haste<br />
Crit<br />
Hit<br />
Spell pen<br />
Expertise<br />
Dodge<br />
Parry<br />
Block<br />
Block value<br />
<br />
So uhhh... I'm pretty sure gear won't only have 2 stats on them =P<br />
<br />
Healers will most likely have stam, int, spirit, crit and haste</div></div><hr />

<br />
* Reforging is another way to customize your gear.<br />
* It will be relatively cheap, you will need a Blacksmith / Leatherworker / Tailor / Jewelcrafter / Engineer to do it. Each profession get to reforge a type of items.<br />
* It lets you reduce one stat for another. Some restrictions will apply, you can't put the extra stat on something that is already on the item. <br />
<br />
So it's safe to assume the following:<br />
<br />
- Blacksmith = plate items only.<br />
- Leatherworker = leather/mail items.<br />
- Tailor = cloth items.<br />
- Jewelcrafter = necklace/rings.<br />
- Engineer = trinkets.</div></div><hr />

I've always said that the day i equip a spirit item on my resto shaman is the day i kill myself, so i guess im gonna die at the release date of Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
Im really dissapointed, especially cause i never said a bad word about anything Blizzard made even if it wasnt a very beneficial change, its just such a huge let down for me.<br />
Seriously, this is stupid...<br />
<br />
And all of those change are more than welcome if you have a look at the current itemisation IG : every single item has at least 5-6 different stats which doesn't make sense : merging those combat stats with the more common stats will just reduce the amount of information displayed on every item.<br />
<br />
And for those whinning about the defense cap, yeah it seems pretty obvious that Blizzard just want to remove every tanking mechanics : in the next Xpac a tank will only be a health pool with a lot of armor, of course... -_-</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's start off from archaeology, it does sound interesting, endgamers will probably all want to max it asap cause you save time by being able to travel from place x to y faster and gain recipes/e-peenflexstuff with it. <br />
<br />
I don't really like idea of being able to reforge items. For example as a healer you get and item with x amount of stamina and y amount of int and you don't have any spirit at all in it so you're able to convert ? amount of x into spirit. The only good thing I see in this change is that you'll be able to get the stats you want easier, but hey, is Blizzard just getting lazy with designing items with different statcombinations? <br />
<br />
When it comes to being able to level up trade skills easier by making rare items, I totally agree with it. Making a rare item usually costs you more and it's been a pain in the ass that you gain only 1 point of it/creation if even that. Good that they'll make the &quot;boring&quot; professions more fun. <br />
<br />
Itemization. What the hell are you doing? If there never was mp5, spellpower and stuff like that before but the upcoming stuff instead I would have absolutely nothing against it, but why now after all these years? I'm not worried about having to learn how to calcuate all the gear available, but just the fact that the changes about these seem a bit radical (but I guess that's something you're able to do now cause hunters won't need mana no more). I've never played a melee in my life but I guess the changes about the upcoming melee stats sound just as weird as they do for casters. <br />
<br />
New legendary item? Yay. ROGUE WEAPON? Goblin rogue, anyone?<br />
<br />
New classes. Wow, goblins can shoot 'emselves up the air and worgens can sprint, cool stuff. <br />

It's nice that they're finally getting rid of all these stats. This is an MMO, there's no reason any person should have to worry about balancing 500 different stats. It just makes everything more difficult, even for developers in balancing and itemizing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a difference between difficulty and just flat out time consuming. Choosing gear and getting the right stats is not hard. Its just a nuisance that takes time. Time doing nothing but looking on WoWhead at which item you wanna get next. Removing all of those stats doesn't make the game any easier than it already was. Just makes it so you spend less time browsing WoWhead using the calculator to see which item your going after next.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'd prefer the strategy to be the difficulty of a game, not juggling caps and waiting for the perfect item to drop because itemization is so whack.<br />
<br />
This really isn't that different from Pre-BC. If items had attack power they maybe had 10, 20 on them.<br />

You'll be the same as all other priests? How is that different to now? Currently we all ignore the base stats, and stack spellpower, crit, haste, and whatnot. In the new expansion we'll stack intellect instead of spellpower, spirit instead of mp5. Crit, haste, hit, etc. Will all stay the same. How will this change affect you in any way, other than consolidating a couple of stats into one, the way the did with +healing and +damage back in the day?

Sounds to me like they are making things a whole lot simpler to understand and less of a theorycraft to know exactly which items are better for you and which are not. I hope Retribution ends up no longer needing to worry about mana (much as the Enhancement Shamans).<br />

<br />
&quot;remove every stat on items&quot;? What are you talking about? They're basically removing ArP because it was a pain to calculate, and a bit overpowered in the end. They aren't removing any other stats. Intellect and spellpower are being merged, same with mp5 and spirit, and AP with Str or Agi, depending on your class. I don't understand why everyone's freaking out about this. It's no different to merging +healing and +damage, or merging spell hit and hit.</div></div><hr />

Using add-ons, spreadsheets and EJ?<br />
<br />
It's like math, where 20 x 65 is harder then 113231 x 131234...<br />
Since you KNOW you'll be using a calculator for the second, the first one you actually read and think about.<br />
<br />
I hate this annoying elitist doing from a lot of posters..<br />
You are not better because you use an add-on or calculator that someone else made!<br />
<br />
This makes player less dependant on those things so they can actually do some head-math theirselves.<br />
So I approve (Y)<br />
<br />
<br />
But now.. the hunter changes &gt;.&lt;<br />
Sigh, big big sigh! Energy?<br />
If I wanted energy, I would have rolled rogue or druid.<br />
Hmm, my gf is levelling my pally for me.. I think I will continue with that character till they give them energy too :')<br />
<br />
We have too many spells that use mana, are we really getting mend pet for 5 energy?<br />
But hey! Rogueeeeeeees!!!! We are back &lt;3<br />
All is hunterloot once more! *ninja ninja* <br />

I guess math is not your strongest point:<br />
<br />
- boss X has a loot table, including 1 mail +agi drop, and 1 leather +agi drop.<br />
- for rogues and ferals, thats 1 item they can roll on.<br />
- for hunters that's 2 items they can roll on (which they will).<br />
<br />
It has happened before (vision of sargeras), and it will happen again. At least in WOTLK they NEEDED that extra INT, else they were gimping themselves, so rolling on leather wasnt so good. Now they can freely roll on both.<br />
<br />
It's up to Raid Leaders to decide which class they want to piss off, hunters for limiting them to mail, or rogues/ferals by allowing hunters to roll on their gear.<br />

We don't know the mechanics yet though. Perhaps Hunters will get a Haste -&gt; AP conversion, much like Int -&gt; AP now making Mail Haste pieces more preferrable than Leather ones that tend to have half the Haste of Mail equivalents.<br />

thats only half the argument, the other half is homogenization.<br />
sure most people tend to follow the same trend once the numbers have been established.<br />
but then some content changes and they focus on.. gasp whats this? a different stat or setup.<br />
<br />
now if you remove the alternative stats what are you left with? forced homogenization.<br />
<br />
meaning next expac nobody will have mana, then everyone will heal, then everyone will only have a single talent tree, then we'll all have the same talent tree, then its real life again.</div></div><hr />

Standard Piece of Plate Gear<br />
xxxx Armor<br />
xxx Stamina<br />
xxx Strength<br />
-Option A-<br />
Pick one: Hit, Expertise<br />
Pick one: Crit, Haste, Armor Penetration<br />

<br />
All they are doing is removing Armor Pen, nothing else changes for plate wearers.<br />

<br />
<br />
And they're replacing ArP with 'mastery'. So if anything, plate wearers have exactly the same number of stats. (You never geared for AP.) Agi users have ONE less. Casters have TWO less.<br />
<br />
Plate: Str, Hit, Mastery, Haste, Crit (agi to a very small extent)<br />

Well, they said that +agi will be only stat they need from gear, so no, I don't think there will be conversions like that. They will just take away stats you had on your existing gear and convert them to stats according to new scheme. Which is fine. What's not fine is the fact that hunters WILL roll on leather for new drops.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't say that, you don't know the mechanics or the itemization. What if Haste scales amazingly better for Hunter because more Focus = more DPS? What if it doesn't scale at all for Rogues? Then, since the Developers planned it this way, Mail has twice as much haste than Leather. This would prevent Hunters from wanting Leather, because they want the extra haste on the Mail. Is this going to be the case? I have no idea. But it's possible to design the classes in such a way that Hunter's won't WANT to roll on Leather. Let's just hope they actually do that.</div></div><hr />

I think that the trailer is stating the current moment. It's saying &quot;While you all are battling the lich king, there's a power awakening in the Maelstrom&quot; or something to that effect. I don't think it means that you won't kill Arthas in Wrath. I'm guessing that you'll kill Arthas and it will integrate seamlessly with the awakening of Deathwing and the following cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

Oh don't be silly. If your raid leader has any common sense then leather wearers will obviously have priority on those items and if no one wants them, then hunters can roll. Giving leather to hunter over rogue/druid in such case is just plain retarded.</div></div><hr />

I agree. There's already been 2 expansion that were both pretty much the same. Players are getting bored and Blizzard knows this. They needed to mix things up and bring back the players that have left and that are thinking about leaving. Another &quot;same old&quot; expansion wouldn't have done a thing. Blizzard is extremely smart no question.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game should be challenging because the bosses are difficult, not because it takes time to calcuate stats and then wait for like 4 months because none of the items in your perfect setup ever drop, and tbh if you enjoy looking at gear because you find it challenging maybe go play a simpler game :/</div></div><hr />

I honestly can't stand this anymore. People constantly claiming they are going to ruin wow. This is how it was to start with. Basic stats. That's all we needed, it's all we used. People are saying they are dumbing wow down, I have news for you, if they took away enemy casting bars, buffs showing all the time on enemies, and the hundreds of other little changes they have made over the years people would shit themselves.<br />

<br />
thats fucking retarded, seriously<br />
<br />
Customisation was something that actually required thinking and looking up stuff, getting an excell file out and checking out an upgrade path, changing gear cause of a nonhit trinket, cause the new one has a ton of haste or crit, where will you gain it ? where will you replace it ?<br />
<br />
no, its now all changed to one single stat on gear and if u drop an item that has more of that stat, its better, else its not.<br />
<br />
this also means spriest-mage lock, using the same nontier pieces, and perhaps boomkins and ele shamans to.<br />
<br />
there is only one good thing about this : running the cataclysm version of naxxramas will have retardedly easy to hand out gear.<br />
this brings it to the core of this very change<br />
<br />
WoW 4.0 is for casuals(nothing new) cause<br />
<br />
Casuals get to : see everything, get everything handed to them, expirience everything, kill everything, without the need of skill, time or dedication<br />
<br />
dedicated pve'ers get : hardmodes of what u allready killed that now give loot that has 4 more int or agi<br />
<br />
<br />
so aion, i heard its a nice game<br />

People constantly claiming they are going to ruin wow. This is how it was to start with. Basic stats. That's all we needed, it's all we used. People are saying they are dumbing wow down, I have news for you, if they took away enemy casting bars, buffs showing all the time on enemies, and the hundreds of other little changes they have made over the years people would shit themselves.<br />
<br />
Wow is dumbed down, has been since 2.0. Bring on the old days.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's no secret they've made WoW more for the casual player. It brings new players and lessens the huge gap that there have been in the past. Hardcore players are no more and if there are they whine about it.Give it up it's just a game. Making gear to the point where no one can get it is asinine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
thats fucking retarded, seriously<br />
<br />
Customisation was something that actually required thinking and looking up stuff, getting an excell file out and checking out an upgrade path, changing gear cause of a nonhit trinket, cause the new one has a ton of haste or crit, where will you gain it ? where will you replace it ?<br />
<br />
no, its now all changed to one single stat on gear and if u drop an item that has more of that stat, its better, else its not.<br />
<br />
this also means spriest-mage lock, using the same nontier pieces, and perhaps boomkins and ele shamans to.<br />
<br />
there is only one good thing about this : running the cataclysm version of naxxramas will have retardedly easy to hand out gear.<br />
this brings it to the core of this very change<br />
<br />
WoW 4.0 is for casuals(nothing new) cause<br />
<br />
Casuals get to : see everything, get everything handed to them, expirience everything, kill everything, without the need of skill, time or dedication<br />
<br />
dedicated pve'ers get : hardmodes of what u allready killed that now give loot that has 4 more int or agi<br />
<br />
<br />
so aion, i heard its a nice game<br />
<br />
Just shut the fuck up and quit then, you big fucking baby.<br />
I'm so sick of people like you.<br />

<br />
Gear will now only have &quot;Gear Points&quot;. You may place a gear point into any of the currently existing stats and it will increase the amount of stats per gear point (which may be subjected to diminishing returns if desired).<br />
1 Gear point into stamina = 10 stamina<br />
1 Gear point into spell hit = 1 spell hit<br />
etc. etc.<br />
<br />
The amount of gear points will be higher with higher ilvl gear obviously.<br />
<br />
You can differentiate the gear that drops from healers, tanks, and dps simply be restricting what stats you can gear points you can place in.<br />
<br />
===========================<br />
<br />
This design does two things that will satisfy everyone:<br />
1) the people that wish to keep game mechanics to differentiate the &quot;bads&quot; from the &quot;goods&quot;<br />

2) allow blizzard to be lazy with gear design and they do not need to itemize every single piece of gear and simply let the player do it.</div></div><hr />

By the looks of it,we can infer that reforging will turn agi/int/ect into haste,crit and the like. So basicly,its the same thing except the PLAYER chooses the stats.Wouldn't that require more skill than using gear thats already balanced the momment you get it?<br />
<br />
Why do i think int/agi/str/spirit will turn into haste/crit/ect?<br />
<br />
Well,they are making changes to those stats(Haste/ArmP).Why would blizz bother making changes if they are removing those stats? <br />
Also, it says you will be able to trade a stat for another,and since gear only has white stats,then its safe to say you can turn white stats into the other stats.Simple common sense.</div></div><hr />

The weird thing is, however, that it will still be there, it will just look different. Let's say that the conversion will be something like 1 Int = 1 SP.<br />
<br />
Random WotLK Cloth Piece<br />
xxx Armor<br />
108 Stamina<br />
100 Intellect<br />
65 Spirit<br />

<br />
Essentially these are the same pieces of gear, and provide the same stats. It's just implicit that the spell power is now a part of the intellect. Does it look worse? From an aesthetic standpoint, perhaps, but thats because we are so used to seeing spell power on gear. Remember when they changed all the gear from &quot;Increases spell damage by xx and healing by xx&quot; to just spell power? That was a huge change too, but now we're so used to it, who really cares? I bet this will end up the same way.</div></div><hr />

Shadowmourne - You won't get Frostmourne in Icecrown but Death Knights and Hunters will get a Legendary Axe named Shadowmourne. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
First off, I have to say for the record, Hunter weapon. Now that I have that out of my system, it's about time! Tbh, the legendary bow doesn't really count. Maybe 3 hunters per server had it, as well as rogues and warriors trying to take the bow too, which makes no sense at all. But anyway, besides the bow hunters have only been able to use 1 other legendary, Thunderfury, which wasn't something hunters used in vanilla anyway because for one Rogues Warriors and Pallies were getting the pieces well before hunters, which does make sense. <br />
<br />
Back on track though, this will be the first legendary for hunters specifically, even if it is a dk weapon as well. Hopefully there won't be too many haters, so please just go with it. Anyway, who really expected to actually use THE Frostmourne? Very Very evil here people, I don't think the gods of WoW would want a player with that sword. I mean, come on, right now if you can solo stuff that used to take 20 people, you would become one huge badass, and turn into a superman version of the Lich King. Nobody wants that. So I, for one, am just gonna go with it, and enjoy the novelty. And I hope Blizz doesn't screw it up too bad. Have fun, and please don't be too flamish about it, It's really annoying to scroll through 15 pages of flaming just to see a decent discussion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why do people act like Blizzard is going to change how things are itemized? What's with this notion that things are going to be obvious upgrades or obvious downgrades? It's going to be exactly like it is now, certain pieces will favor certain stats and you'll have to tradeoff to build a specific way.<br />
<br />
To change your example, here's what I expect things like rings to be itemized:<br />
<br />
Random Cataclysm Ring 1 (iLvl 300)<br />
100 Stamina<br />
85 Intellect<br />
60 Spirit<br />
Increases critical strike rating by 72.<br />
<br />
Random Cataclysm Ring 2 (iLvl 300)<br />
107 Stamina<br />
70 Intellect<br />
85 Spirit<br />
Increases critical strike rating by 60.<br />
<br />
Random Cataclysm Ring 3 (iLvl 300)<br />
103 Stamina<br />
74 Intellect<br />
72 Spirit<br />
Increases haste rating by 38.<br />
Increases critical strike rating by 36.<br />
<br />
You're still going to have to make choices for gear. Do you want:<br />
A - A heavy spellpower/crit ring with low regen.<br />
B - A heavy regen ring with low spell power/crit.<br />
C - A balanced spellpower/regen ring with low crit, but with additional haste.<br />
<br />
Please, let's try to think about this logically.</div></div><hr />

Exactly, these people must be running with really shitty guilds/raid leaders. In 99% of all the raids I've been in, main spec armor always went to that class over offspec for other classes. IE Priests get priority on cloth over shaman, druid and pally healers. Cloth caster gear goes to mages, warlocks and shadow priests over ele shammy's/boomkins. Druid heals got priority over shamans and pally's for leather healing gear ect. If this has ever been a problem, leave your shitty ass guild for a better one that actually knows how loot should be distributed.</div></div><hr />

I'm kind of curious as to how this change may effect Enhancement Shamans. As it is now they both share the same type of gear but if hunters no longer need mana will shamans see a decrease in mana cost on Shocks and Lightning Bolt or will they get a talent to increase their mana pool or improved mana regen?<br />

•Haste: Will also increase the rate at which you gain energy, runes, and focus. Retribution paladins and Enhancement shaman will have a talent that allows them to take advantage of this benefit.<br />

Expect a Haste to scale the amount of mana gained through Imp. Stormstrike and Judgements of the Wise.</div></div><hr />

Oh... like &quot;weapon skill&quot; that they broke apart and turned into expertise becuase it was to easy/good to stack.<br />

All the stat changes seem like they simply want to simplify the math for themselves. So they can stop getting slapped in the face with all the numbers and spreadsheets that the theorycrafters develop to show them they don't even understand their own game.<br />

What's with this notion that things are going to be obvious upgrades or obvious downgrades? It's going to be exactly like it is now, certain pieces will favor certain stats and you'll have to tradeoff to build a specific way.<br />
<br />
To change your example, here's what I expect things like rings to be itemized:<br />
<br />
Please, let's try to think about this logically.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I cut out your examples, but I will explain from a warlock point of view.<br />
<br />
For a warlock (destruction), everything has stam+int+spellpower. Then you get two more stats on your gear - spirit, haste, crit or hit.<br />
<br />
The thing is, hit has a cap. Haste has a cap (softcap) where it becomes less desirable. So the only things that don't cap are crit (unless you can get 100%, which you can't) and spirit.<br />
<br />
Now remove spirit. Remove spellpower.<br />
<br />
Everything has int+stamina (assumption), and once you cap hit, there's only haste and crit. And once you softcap haste, you want crit. More crit. And more crit. There's not really anything else to look for.<br />
<br />
Does that really sound exciting and interesting?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">patrux</div><div class="date">2009-08-22, 04:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">i was all looking forward to it, untill i saw this rediculous removal of stats<br />
<br />
thats fucking retarded, seriously<br />
<br />
Customisation was something that actually required thinking and looking up stuff, getting an excell file out and checking out an upgrade path, changing gear cause of a nonhit trinket, cause the new one has a ton of haste or crit, where will you gain it ? where will you replace it ?<br />
<br />
no, its now all changed to one single stat on gear and if u drop an item that has more of that stat, its better, else its not.<br />
<br />
this also means spriest-mage lock, using the same nontier pieces, and perhaps boomkins and ele shamans to.<br />
<br />
there is only one good thing about this : running the cataclysm version of naxxramas will have retardedly easy to hand out gear.<br />
this brings it to the core of this very change<br />
<br />
WoW 4.0 is for casuals(nothing new) cause<br />
<br />
Casuals get to : see everything, get everything handed to them, expirience everything, kill everything, without the need of skill, time or dedication<br />
<br />
dedicated pve'ers get : hardmodes of what u allready killed that now give loot that has 4 more int or agi<br />
<br />
<br />
so aion, i heard its a nice game<br />
<br />
<br />
Aion ain't for PvE'rs, next.</div></div><hr />

If it were *truly* balanced completely alliance would have 4 paladins, but it's not that important.<br />

My mistake, I seemed to have forgotten that draenei are pallys. But all im trying to say is horde really do not need another shaman. To make it balanced it would seem to just give the horde the pally and leave it at that. This also has to deal with lore and such. And as far as im concerned, Goblins are not magical caster beings. They always have all the technology crap. Which is why im so confused. Refer to my first post.</div></div><hr />

Anyone read of a new hero class, or any hints of one? I thought there was supposed to be one with each expansion. Well, we still have time. I'm waiting on the Sapper class :P<br />

I'll be sure to save this post when all of this does go live and you quit for fearing change. You do realise making a new class, especially a hero one has been shown as a huge undertaking? Here we are almost a year since the release of Wrath and DK's are finally getting balanced somewhat.

Welcome to the world of Plate itemization, now your class is on the same page with Warriors and Paladins. Here, I'll change your post to show you what I mean.<br />
<br />
For a Paladin (Retribution), everything has Stamina and Strength. Then you get two more stats on your gear - Hit, Expertise, Crit, and Haste.<br />
<br />
The thing is, Hit and Expertise both have a cap. Haste isn't desireable for ANY 2Hander class, it's essentially wasted itemization points. So the only things that don't cap are Crit (unless you can get 100%, which you can't).<br />
<br />
Everything has Stamina and Strength (assumption), and once you cap Hit/Expertise, there's only Haste and Crit. And you never wanted Haste to begin with, you want Strength. More Strength. And more Strength. There's not really anything else to look for.<br />

Goblin Shaman sets an imbalance between giving horde and alliance equal amounts of shaman/paladin (originally faction-exclusive)<br />

With all the homogenizing of gear, what makes you think they are going to keep intellect on mail physical dps gear? The will just turn enhance to ret with 5k mana (we can do it, so can you)</div></div><hr />

With enough dedication and skill, you too can play an MMO. And don't forget, when your DPS is over 5000, you receive a salary, benefits and an engaging and exciting career.<br />

Well, aside from armor penetration, that someone else mentioned... In cataclysm, haste will be a better stats for physical dps as it will increase your regen rates for focus/rage/runes. Doubt they'll leave retris in the cold there - but who knows? ::)<br />
<br />
Also the reforging system might make it so that if you have 100 hit rating more than you need on your gear, maybe you can reforge those 100 hit rating into X intellect or Y crit rating instead. Then item choices would open up alot.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">WilliamAG</div><div class="date">2009-08-22, 04:56 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Agreed. Gut instinct says we'll see the next xpac in April or May. Maybe March but I think that'll be cutting it close.<br />
That all depends on if it takes more time to redesign a zone than to create a new zone from scratch. If it takes less time, then the release is sooner. If it is more time, then the release is later.<br />
<br />
Though from that video, it looks like that the folks at Blizzard already have working models of the redesigned zones, which means the content might be sooner.<br />
<br />
Blizzard could be shooting for a late February 2010 release like they did with the Burning Crusade.<br />
<br />
But either way, a lot of these zone redesigns are probably going to start hitting the normal servers before the launch of the Cataclysm Expansion Pack. Too many things can go wrong if they did all these changes at once.<br />
<br />
We already know from the test server that we are getting quests that hint to the changes that are coming.<br />
<br />
The third impact (in game) will likely happen sooner than you think. (Sorry to all you EVA fans out there.) ;)</div></div><hr />

200 intellect<br />
100 spirit<br />
<br />
then one that is:<br />
<br />
100 intellect<br />
50 spirit<br />
50 spell power<br />
20 mp5<br />
<br />
It just looks better. Its about time they get rid of the stupidity that is the defense rating as well. I personally can't bring myself to play a tank that isn't a druid anymore because I'm tired of playing the defense balancing game. Gear upgrades should be gear upgrades and because of the stupidity that is defense that is not always the case. Now they just need to get rid of crap like resilience. I also LOVE how they are talking up &quot;rated battlegrounds&quot; but not mentioning arenas at all. Maybe they finally realized when less than 10% of your player base competes in a system it might just not be that fun.</div></div><hr />

Everquest 2 is still pretty fun, but is NOT made for a wide audience so it could never hope to nab the fanbase that WoW has. And Aion, well...I tried the beta out and it was pretty fun, but I don't see it overturning WoW. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warhammer is a much better game than WoW. Hands down, its just a much better game. Its much more fun and the majority of the systems are much more playable. It actually focuses on fun through out the entire game instead of grinding to the end to grind for the gear. The problem with it is that it doesn't have server stability because they were dumb enough to not use decent servers. However, its still 100x more fun than current WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Had they not given Goblins shaman, there would have been 3 Shaman and 2 Paladin for Horde, with 3 Paladins and 2 Shaman for alliance. <br />
<br />
<br />
Ok, are you proud of yourself? You drove me to create an account on this website, because I was sick of hearing your verbal butthurt.<br />
<br />
You're completely missing the big picture. Alliance also has one extra of a class, which balances, if not tips the scales in favor of the Alliance. Alli now officially, in the Worgen, has one extra what? What is this? Druid. The class that was limited to not 4, not 3 races, but one. There was originally ONE class per faction that could use a druid. And quite enjoying them, and knowing that there were only one per faction, kind of annoyed me as the alliance were getting another race that could use them. One more shaman on the Horde side (that could originally use them!) shouldn't be as big of a deal.<br />
<br />
These goblins are shamans because they were shipwrecked, and came from a completely different place. They are not Gadgetzan goblins, and they are not Venture Co. goblins. They have a completely different set of morals and ideals than these goblins. Think about it, it would argueably make sense for worgen to be druids (though I say argueably because I don't think a werewolf beast people summoned by mages would be too attuned to the earth and its spirits), then they may have made them druids anyways. Think about it. If the horde had the same amount of pallies and shammies as the alliance, but the alliance had one more of a unique class to each faction, where would that leave us?<br />
<br />
The arguement is over. Blizz thought about this beforehand, and adjusted accordingly, so leave it alone and shut your whore mouth. No more QQing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sure they're removing a few itemization stats from gear (SP, AP, etc...), but they also expressed plans on adding features such as the Path of the Titans. Personally? I'd love that change. There's a certain set talent spec for nearly every class in order to maximize dps and such that everyone pretty much follows now. If what they plan is actually executed, you'll hopefully see a bunch of different builds that are viable instead of for example, seeing every single boomkin with the exact same spec.</div></div><hr />

Hunter's mana is GONE!!!<br />
Hunters now use focus, no longer care about intellect or mana regen. <br />
Focus regenerates contunously, Steady shot improves the rate of getting focus bag.<br />
Rogue energy comes back at a 10 / sec rate, Hunter focus comes back at 6/sec (12/sec with steady shot) <br />
A shot costs 30 to 60 focus. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
DO NOT WANT, I've always hated playing rogues, simply because of the whole energy thing, but now there doing it to my favourite class? the hunter? you must be kidding, this kinda ruins my excitement for this expansion.. :-[[/list]</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grenn</div><div class="date">2009-08-22, 05:45 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't know what people are freaking out about... It sounds like it is going back to the way gear use to be. (though for lawls the last set should just be called of the falcon or what have you.) I think people are just upset cause they want to see all that green lettering underneath their gear. <br />
<br />
By synchronizing stats it will be easier to balance classes (warriors and priests go yay, pallies go &gt;:l). Cause they can give different preferred speccs (cause everyone copy and pastes speccs now a days.) the same stats vs. other classes to see how they scale then they can decide what to do about buffing or nerfing or altering. As in they could give a fire mage 500 base int and a shadow priest 500 base in and do tests to see how each does well, and also with all the other casters etc. Rather than have SP which can do different things for different classes at different rates. (Hopefully all spell power will scale the same on ALL spells and then they will decrease/increase dmg coefficients where they need be, same with AP).<br />
<br />
I just think people are gettin upset over nothing... there will still be gear and gear will still play a part.. but it seems like what they are trying to do is that when someone has crappy dps or healing or tanking instead of thinking &quot;hmmmmmm... I need to update my gear&quot; they will think hmmm... maybe I should tweak my specc to work for me. Overall it seems like it is becoming a more skill based and talent based game rather than gear/ class based game.<br />
<br />
Idk, sounds really awesome imo.</div></div><hr />

If you read about a page ago I was saying that the imbalance between the two previously faction-exclusive classes was &quot;not that important&quot;. What you quoted was me justifying my questioning of Blizzards decision to add Goblin Shaman. It's crazy what can make people nerdrage these days.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Trolls can also be Druids now, giving both the horde and alliance two druids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're enabling faction changes: Alliance-&gt;Horde and Horde-&gt;Alliance.<br />
<br />
Unless they've changed their mind, I believe they're still sticking to their guns about not allowing race changes within factions.<br />
<br />
If that is the case, just wait it out. It'll change too.</div></div><hr />

I've always loved old world content and to finally see those zones opened that were closed is pretty awesome. The new talent system sounds interesting can't wait to hear more details about that. I don't play a warlock or a hunter but the changes to shards sounds awesome. I'm not sure about the focus system since I've never played a hunter. If its like rogue/kitty druids then it might not be all that bad? So Ret Pallys are the only Phys DPS left with mana as a resource or do enhancement shamans still use it but not rely on it as much as they do now?</div></div><hr />

Take away the spellpower gains from my pure spellpower gems and trinket, and you get a number very close to that.</div></div><hr />

I'm excited about the SP changes. My main spec is Disc with the rare chance I decide to play shadow. Do you think they will keep the talents that give you more Spirit/Int?</div></div><hr />

It's just going to water the game down even further. Most healers are stacking Int already, with these changes the DPS will be too.<br />

Some amazing changes but why do they want to remove so much stats? I think they want to close more Itemization-Niches :-/</div></div><hr />

One of the biggest fun of this game for me is figuring out is this item gonna improve me more or not. In some cases an item with a lower ilvl is better then one with the higher one simply because of certain combination of stats and to change that simply because some people cba to &quot;calculate&quot; is beyond me.<br />

not everyone enjoys drawing up spreadsheets to figure out stats. this will be much better and brings things back to the way they were pre-BC.</div></div><hr />

Iam still confused, what does this means?:D Spirit for Paladin healers?:D<br />

They really need to totally redesign all the talent trees and abilitys to make this happn. This is madness.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The changes to gear stats is NOT removing AP / SP etc from the game, its removing SP / AP etc from gear, you will still have AP on rings, AP gems, SP trinkets, SP Rings and so on. They are making it so that gear will be a base stat conversion from talents or class, IE wars get AP from Strength, Rogues from Agility and so on.<br />
<br />
You can then Reforge an item to give you a diff stat that you want by lossing a stat currently on the gear, like trading Stam for Haste / Hit / Crit or what not (not 100% sure on how much or what ratio you get, will be watching tomorrow to see what the deal is).<br />
<br />
I just see alot of QQ... trying to do my part to clear up the info, alot of people didn't see the Q&amp;A and are going off what is written down from people who aren't in-the-know.</div></div><hr />

now that you see some changes that resemble old times you QQ just as much.<br />

Mass ressurection ? like 4 stats total to go for ? It's just all a bit too ridiculous. The changes to aoe in wotlk were bad enough already now that CC doesn't exist anymore and everyone just zergs whatever they see instead of having to think about it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xentropy</div><div class="date">2009-08-22, 07:17 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">For casters, the changes really won't make a huge difference. Spellpower is just on every single cloth item in the entire endgame. Period. Removing spellpower and rolling it into intellect does absolutely nothing except shorten the item descriptions. Rolling mp5 and spirit together doesn't change a whole lot either, really, since as it is now spirit is just mp5 that only works for some classes instead of all. Melee has always gotten more out of raw stats than casters have, so it makes sense to make casters actually give a damn about a base stat.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thorgred</div><div class="date">2009-08-22, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Personally I am pleased about the Mp5 removal. Mp5 is boring, and it created the need for more different types of loot (ie, Mp5/crit, Spirit/crit, Mp5/hit, Spirit/hit etc etc)<br />
<br />
I am a little worried that gear might start to look boring. 100 Stamina, 100 Crit, 100 Intellect.... Also unless the conversion rate is done well, I personally like having spell power as a visible stat and hate having to make the mental % conversions when I have talents that do that.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Number one thing that annoys me out of all those lists: Defense rating removal.<br />
As a dedicated tank i plead PLEASE do not do this. It is useful for people to be able to throw on a set of tank gear and play well in it as a different spec, (especially as you can't rely on everyone to have dual talent spec). You consciously removed +Defense talents when WotLK hit so that it was possible (for example) to tank as a ret-specced paladin. You said you wouldn't balance the game around people having dual spec, but this seems like a step in the wrong direction.</div></div><hr />
