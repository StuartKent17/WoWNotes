<br />
New models have smoother animations and he had to align it to the original's timeframe for the sounds to match the length so that's why it looks a bit off in certain parts, so even though the animations play at the same speed, they don't look like they do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How so? It was a weapon specifically designed to kill him. You're saying he should've just been able to laugh and ignore it like some OP Mary Sue character? &quot;Hahahah! Even though you poured years of research, countless resources, and fine-tuned it perfectly to work against powerful living AND undead beings, I am completely immune and unaffected!&quot;<br />
<br />
He already resisted it far better than any other creature out there. Instead of melting him and killing him almost instantly, it gave him a really bad cough and hurt enough for him to say 'fuck this, I'm out'.</div></div><hr />

It probably has to do more with how cartoony and rubbery faced the new models are. they have the same issue in the actual blizzard created game cutscenes that use in game models. I laugh more at the overly exaggerated facial animations. This remaster just highlights it more because of the close ups on the faces.</div></div><hr />

Aside of Malygos going mad and preparing to purge the world of all magic users he didn't approve of while at the same time attacking other flights, Nozdormu being lost in time, Ysera sleeping and not really able to lead the greens, and Scourge running all over dragon shrines in Dragonblight?

<br />
It's more likely that the person that animated this doesn't have as good a grasp on facial animation or was inexperienced working with the facial rigs.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has been able to get fine results animating on their new character models with their cutscenes. Animating dialogue is difficult; that's why Blizzard has designated animators on their cinematics team that work on such things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It had its moments, most notably with Bolvar's facial animations that were good and bad. When he's calling out Arthas is an example of good. When he's dying at the end is an example of bad.<br />
<br />
I'd be legitimately surprised if Blizzard didn't have him on payroll one way or another. I know he did the stuff for the Blizzard &quot;LOL E-SPORTS&quot; stuff on the Launcher, I'm pretty sure he got some compensation for that</div></div><hr />

<br />
Pretty sure the expansion was called Wrath of the Lich King. Not Lich King gets pwned by a 15th Century Plague Doctor. <br />
<br />
The whole point of the expansion was to show how powerful and threatening Arthas was and that the only way he could be killed was in close proximity to his seat of power. So seeing some fucking Forsaken nobody make him run off crying for mommy was simply pathetic. <br />
I'm just glad the Alliance got to rip that stupid mask off Putress' face and shove it up his ass sideways when we invaded the Undercity.<br />

You are comparing a fan remaster using current in game assets to the old assets. He didn't &quot;make&quot; any of this, just reskinned what was already created. Also it doesn't compare to how blizzard uses their assets for the current in game cutscenes, present day is much better quality.</div></div><hr />

Really weak..only the raised undead army including dragons makes him strong.....oneshotting the most powerful heroes during the fight.....(saved by Ashbringer..) mopped the floor with the choosen one (Illidan) so whatever mate...</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should read the book. Illidan was toying with Arthas not even fighting with both weapons at the beginning, had him 2 times defeated got cocky and toyed even more with him. Than 2 random lucky strikes. <br />
<br />
Raising an army doesn’t make him strong. And he did not one shot the greatest hero’s. He stunned a old paladin and a elite troop. <br />
<br />
Greatest hero’s would be the classes with the weapons from legion and alone the dk is stronger than the lichking at this point.<br />
<br />
Remember we defeated the lichking with only mortals. Not special item , no god or half god helping nothing. <br />
<br />
But fanboys who don’t read the lore can’t be argued with anyway. <br />
<br />
But I trust more what blizzard states than what you think</div></div><hr />

Remember we defeated the lichking with only mortals. Not special item , no god or half god helping nothing. <br />
<br />
But fanboys who don’t read the lore can’t be argued with anyway. <br />
<br />
But I trust more what blizzard states than what you think<br />
<br />
Chronicles vol 3 and the research story for the dk frost artifact says Arthas and Illidan are even matched in that fight but it was luck that made Arthas win that day, however legion Illidan got a lot of power from absorbing souls from demons and fully &quot;digesting&quot; the power of Gul'Dan, so he will win this time without any doubt.</div></div><hr />

1. The guy did an amazing job updating the cinematic with the constraints the original placed on him <br />
2. A large portion of the fanbase is really pathetic and gets insulted when anyone else achieves anything. <br />
<br />
I enjoyed this a lot more than the original, because the original looks so janky its distracting. Great work, guy who wont ever read this.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It did seem a bit faster, and Bolvar's facial expressions, particularly when yelling for Arthas, were a tad uncanny valley.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The whole point of the expansion was to show how powerful and threatening Arthas was and that the only way he could be killed was in close proximity to his seat of power. So seeing some fucking Forsaken nobody make him run off crying for mommy was simply pathetic. <br />
I'm just glad the Alliance got to rip that stupid mask off Putress' face and shove it up his ass sideways when we invaded the Undercity.<br />
<br />
So yeah. Fuck this scene! Fuck Putress! And fuck the Forsaken!I could have sworn we dealt with a poster like you in the lore sub-forum not too long ago...<br />
<br />
Anyways, it's a fantastic remake. I don't want to think about how long it must have taken.</div></div><hr />

Of course it is. The animator did a great job with remastering this cutscene. It's miles better than the original.<br />
I'm just saying I have always had a bone to pick with this cutscene in general. Just the way everyone gets punked by these Forsaken twats has always left a bitter taste in my mouth.</div></div><hr />

Can't wait to see your version... Obviously you've done a better version right? no? didn't think so...<br />
<br />
why would I waste my time on something like that? Only &quot;people&quot; like you care about it, and to normals like me, it does not matter.<br />
<br />
I'll let you ponder that one.</div></div><hr />

What is the timestamp on that from the video? Can't seem to find it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I kind of get what he's saying, he's just not articulating it very well. It's true, challenging a character's strength and determination gives the character depth by revealing fears and motivations. Bolvar was the hero here. His mettle against pure evil was tested. We sympathized with him.<br /> 
<br />
But the Lich King is meant to be the be all, end all of that story. Having him show weakness to a sub-plot character is a disservice to the heroes' journey and overall narrative. Like Boba Fett showing up at the end of Empire Strikes Back, kills Luke and almost kills Vader.</div></div><hr />
