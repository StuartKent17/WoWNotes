Armory Stats - Highmaul and Blackrock Foundry<br />
Today we are taking a look at the Highmaul and Blackrock Foundry achievement completion rate of players. The data used today is a sample of 6.1 million characters from 3.1 million accounts. We also did this for Siege of Orgrimmar during of Mists of Pandaria, which you can see here (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3984-armory-stats-siege-of-orgrimmar-progression-blue-tweets-dlc-439). <br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
Time pressure and sports (i.e. the clock ticking down). Some video games have it, some don't (e.g. WSG vs. AB). What do you think about it? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/579496314771271680))<br />
It makes more sense in 1v1 sport like tennis. Otherwise turtling. Think football during the final 2 minutes of a game(spiking)<br />
yeah or basketball where they pass the ball around for 20 seconds. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/579499647334400001))<br />
<br />
It does have a timer, 15 min, which I personally think is way too short, I'd like longer games.<br />
20 in RBGs though. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/579498410115371009))<br />
it's also 15 in wargame tournament rules unfortunately. Slightly skews rbg tournaments<br />
Sounds like a bug. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/579515290612080640))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Besides WoW PvP do you watch any other E-Sports?<br />
I have enjoyed watching Smash, League, Counter-Strike and Heroes. Only scene I follow besides WoW is Heroes. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/579515146445393920))<br />

Blizzard released an overview video of the Tomb of the Spider queen map added in the latest patch.<br />
<br />

<br />
Rift - Wardrobe Update<br />
Rift is also getting a Wardrobe feature in Patch 3.2 (http://community.riftgame.com/en/2015/03/26/3-2-wardrobe-update/). <br />
<br />
<br />
When any armor or weapon is added to your inventory, its appearance is automatically unlocked for you across your entire account.<br />
You can create and save wardrobe sets to allow easy switching of your appearance.<br />
You can use dyes to color the armor in any slot.<br />
A future patch will also add Wardrobe sets you can collect, with the UI showing your progress towards collecting the full set. <br />

<br />
Wowprogress statistics only include players who raid current tier content in a guild and aren't representative of the whole userbase. This sample includes all kinds of players, including PvP players, RPs and casuals who haven't stepped into any current tier raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or it's a success because that's exactly what Mythic is for and the reason why we have 4 difficulties. And also, way over 10% of raiding guilds have killed bosses in BRF Mythic.</div></div><hr />

How exactly does removing content, that 2% of the players do, prevent burnout? What exactly are you suggesting that they go back to, that worked according to you?</div></div><hr />

One problem sign that I can see amongst all raiding guilds is recruiting people. Nobody wants to join a heroic guild, the only people getting recruits worth anything or even at all are already established mythic guilds.<br />
<br />
My raid team is capable of doing mythics, we just cant get enough recruits to get a consistent 20 man roster. Either they need to go back to flex mythic, or reduce mythic requirement to 15 people.<br />
<br />
It's just too hard to get 20+ skilled people online at the same time for multiple days for several hours. If it could be 15+ flex, we would actually be able to work on Mythic! At least in the pre-mythic stages of MoP, our 10 man guild (at the time) could work on top tier content albeit harder restrictions on smaller groups.<br />
as of right now we're stuck on the recruitment boss with a full heroic geared group hoping for warforged/socketed drops.... for 6.2 I guess?<br />

One problem sign that I can see amongst all raiding guilds is recruiting people. Nobody wants to join a heroic guild, the only people getting recruits worth anything or even at all are already established mythic guilds.<br />
<br />
My raid team is capable of doing mythics, we just cant get enough recruits to get a consistent 20 man roster. Either they need to go back to flex mythic, or reduce mythic requirement to 15 people.<br />
<br />
It's just too hard to get 20+ skilled people online at the same time for multiple days for several hours. If it could be 15+ flex, we would actually be able to work on Mythic! At least in the pre-mythic stages of MoP, our 10 man guild (at the time) could work on top tier content albeit harder restrictions on smaller groups.<br />
as of right now we're stuck on the recruitment boss with a full heroic geared group hoping for warforged/socketed drops.... for 6.2 I guess?<br />
<br />
This is not a matter of boss and raid difficulty, this is a matter of getting enough people together.<br />
<br />
Did you start recruiting when WoD hit or did you recruit during 5.4? You had a year to prepare for the 20 man raids.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rudol Von Stroheim</div><div class="date">2015-03-27, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly don't know why they don't just simply make all raid content 10-man. It's easier for many larger guilds to do two 10-man teams than for small guilds to do one 20-man. At this time I'd simply trash LFR, Flex, and go to a 10-man normal to heroic setup. Then spend more time working on my dungeons to make their heroic versions more difficult with greater reward/opportunity for progression for those that just can't get into the raiding scene.<br />
<br />
Right now dungeons are about pointless. LFR is about pointless. Mythic is about pointless. Why? Because they either don't really provide the game much of anything or are so remotely accessed they might as well be a non-feature for 90% of the population. This is why the game feels so featureless right now. This is honestly one of the most poorly managed endgames to date.<br />
<br />
Bolster your non-raiding content and paths of progression. Simplify and downsize raiding content for easier assembling of teams.<br />
<br />
Right now I love FFXIV because I can farm dungeons(and they're well-designed and fun) for points which allow me to get my characters to ilvl100 as fast as I desire. Then from there I can run Syrcus Tower, a pug raid designed purely with that in mind, and farm sands/oils to improve said items to ilvl110. Meanwhile I have poetic points which are capped weekly; however, provide me with ilvl120 gear. Much like the ilvl100 stuff, I can grab a weekly, do the three-set of pug raids(Labyrinth of the Ancients, Syrcus Tower, and World of Darkness), and upgrade each 120 item to 130. That's as high as the gear from the most difficult raid content in the game.<br />
<br />
Basically, you can be as strong as you desire without even raiding really and it's fun to do so. While the raid content, which is more hardcore in nature, provides people with a great challenge and experience for probably what is easily the coolest looking gear in the game. You really pop with that stuff on. You also only need 8 people to do it while the 24-man content is the pugged raids I was talking about. Literally 3-team raids and they're fun as hell and anyone can do them.<br />
<br />
I 'unno, for a game with HUGE emphasis on the very back-end of their content Blizzard just doesn't really impress as of late. They seem to be getting worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well considering all of us quit the game after ToT in MoP (because of non flex specific 10 man raiding that was poorly tuned requiring 11-12 raiders to adjust per fight need) and came back for WoD, We started recruiting in WoD. Merged with some old friends that were pretty good and managed to get about 16 people. It's just an up and down of recruits from the beginning.<br />

<br />
I wonder if they're going to continue to limit LFR loot (no tier) and making us wait longer to access the wings? Seems like they're inhibiting the vast majority of the player base. Curious about Normal and Heroic attendance, though.</div></div><hr />

You need about 12 people to raid 10 man anyways (unless everyone has 100% attendance, but thats unlikely) and with off specs you rarely need to swap people mid raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its better for us all! <br />
<br />
for the game, for the players and for you!<br />
<br />
I would have to agree totally with you. I remember while back in beta, so many were calling this the best expansion in the game. I am not sure how many of those people actually had beta access, but I was not see the same things they were. Blizzard got a ton of feedback, but yet chose not to really take much of it. I also remember people constantly asking questions about the lack of content. The timeless isle approach and using it in and entire world of content was a disaster in the making. How they equated a catch up featured island to a total successful one enough to apply it to a whole world of content, was beyond me. <br />
<br />
At this point, I enjoyed Cata more than this one and I simply hated Cata as a whole. I doubt given what they have delivered to date,6.2 is going to get any better. If we simply get more garrison stuff and jumping puzzles to go along with some more selfie stuff, I will have to simply stop playing this game. <br />
<br />
I was really hoping for the 2nd coming of TBC or even Wrath from a story perspective, this does not even get close to what little they had for a story in Cata, let alone either of those two expansion. They sure as hell put a lot of pressure on 6.2 to deliver big and big it better or this won't be going down as the best expansion. The world look amazing, BRF from a design is also amazing, some of the featured tech is some of the best they have done to date, yet it lack a story, most if not all the content has to been consumed by many many times over by now. Dungeons that have little or no purpose, nicely done for a change, but no real reason to go back through them once one get whatever gear they need and dungeon achievements.<br />
<br />
In many parts of this content it feel very incomplete for what has been done. Things feel a bit hurried in places, maybe to see the light of day in another patch, maybe not. It feels in those places that it was simply slapped together at the last minute and not the two or three years plus they actually been working on it. Seem like they started creating the content when they brought 5.4 out or after that. They have said in the past that they are always working on the next expansion while still working on the current and they are conceptualizing and design for the next one after that. If this is true, then how did they only get what they launched done?<br />
<br />
Seem in the past with a smaller team they pumped out far more than this huge one they have now. WoW been their cash cow to be able to do other games. Seems at this point, they are just trying to milk it out for all its worth. Which is sad when one gives it some thought. This could have been the best work they have done, but someone chose to get greedy and give back not so much in return. This expansion so far is more like a glorified content patch with a lot of dungeons and couple raids. Using difficulties to equate them as additional content, just means they tried to cut corners elsewhere thinking the masses would not notice it much. The graphs above with the snapshot they give more than show the level of raid participation in this game. Yet they put the most effort into creating that content and not so much to what people seem be doing.</div></div><hr />

I starting up a brand new raiding guild in January and have recruited my way up to 20+ and am starting to do mythic raids, granted i am on a high pop server, but a majority of them have been recruits from other servers.

<br />
Exactly and nobody wanted to be the 11th/12th. which is why flex was such a great addition, everyone could go without hurting the raid.<br />
Once we lost a critical floater that rotated evenly, we started to lose progression. Once we lost the second tank, even after several new tank recruits we couldnt get back to where we were and the guild crumbled.<br />
<br />
I sadly forsee the same thing happening now. People arent going to stick around to continue clearing heroic for no reason, they will want to advance to mythic.<br />
We cant get a 20+ man roster even with multiple forum recruitment posts, trade chat spam, and paid server transfers for those prepared/interested for mythic.<br />
tell me that isnt a player restriction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I bet if they broke the numbers down further the vast majority in the first chart would be those that cleared the raid content on the LFR, yet you are conveying it be removed. The next two charts more than take a snapshot of how many people actually raid in an organized group or use the group finder to do so to clear the content. It sad they spend the greatest amount of design and development still on a feature that even people largely are not going into those difficulties or very few are able to go into those difficulties. Actually, I would love for them to give as much effort they do in raid content to the world content as whole. Jumping puzzles, garrisons, selfie cameras, twitter integration to further bolster the &quot;ME&quot; crowd of the game. <br />
<br />
The world in most part plays more like a single player game, than a MMO and for those that usually try to get a group together for a world boss or an apexis daily on an alt and even a few months back when everyone was still doing those, were simply met on my realm with stop spamming general or what not and use the group finder to join a group. The fact that a person can't get in a group on their own realm and have to resort having to go on the group finder to join one on another realm. more than tells the state of the current players that play this game. Mind you not all people that play are numb nuts, but there are enough of them that it just makes wanting to do any group content a horrid experience outside a group of friends. <br />
<br />
It also does not matter, if these people are in the minority or not. The fact they are in the game makes it less a wonderful experience for everyone that has to come in contact with them on any level of content in this game. They used to be largely put in a box before we got all the cross-realm crap put in the game. At least if someone acted up they were simply treated like they were a plague and they had to resort to name changes and in most cases had to either transfer off the realm or leave the game because no one wanted to deal with their crap. This does not happens anymore, there are very few check and balances to use for the player anymore to combat the idiot of the game. Blizzard open the flood gates and the genie is completely out of the bottle now and everyone get to experience the garbage now, not just a few.</div></div><hr />

its really hard for lfr raiders to take the next step into actuall raiding. you wanna know why ? because of the shitty additude alot of people have towards those who are actually interested in giving it a try, but get absolutely shat on because they get told they are not good enough. its not blizzards fault, its the playerbase that refuse to let those people give it a try. the new pug system was a nice attempt from blizzard to make it easier to get groups going for raids, but to be fair it has been the worse thing that have happened to the game. trying to get into a pug group for a raid is impossible unless your ilvl is high, and it makes me cringe superhard when i see some of the ilvl reqs on raids that are way over the actuall ilvl req for that raid. lfr needs to stay in the game for these reasons. i find it kinda sad that some players are forced to raid lfr because they cant progress trough other difficulties.</div></div><hr />

I have no clue what a &quot;No True Scotsman&quot;-like definition of &quot;raiding guild&quot; is supposed to be but if you think using random words will prove me wrong, go for it.<br />
<br />
But sure, 10% might be a bit too high, depending on the definition of a raiding guild. It is about 3% if you count guilds that did 1/7 N as raiding guilds if that's how you want to see it. It's around 14% if you define a guild that raids at least once a week as a raiding guild.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, I could care less for the feature as long as our gear still looks like garbage. Update the models all you want. They remain appearing terrible with those ghetto ass kicks on. Seriously, I thought it was strange for them to put so much effort and time into new models only to outfit them with horrendously outdated gear concepts. Now we simply look like high-res versions of 2004, the leap is minimal feeling at best. Then take a gander at Tyrande, Thrall, Sylvanas, etc... that gear needs to be common for the players.

<br />
Being someone that raided in the past it was truly amazing to watch how these, so called raiders acted when the came into the LFR. They slam on people, like you say and then think that is going to make them want to strive to become a better player. Like shaming someones is simply going to make them want to better themselves and want to go into a higher difficulty of raid content. Maybe a few, but not the majority will bother and most of those see how these people are treating and interacting with others. To me, if the whole purpose is to try to enlarge the raiding base, which is what Blizzard was hoping for that positive effect, but it went south when many of the raiders decided to act worse than little children. <br />
<br />
Sure there are a lot of people that do not give a crap what others are think of them and never will. But a person that is either coming back to the game either never raided before or another person is new to the game and they are see how these so called raiders at acting towards others. It makes them pause and wonder if they want to bother to take the next step, some do and some don't. If one is simply on the fence about raiding they are going to first look at people from how they conductive themselves, there skill level more than shown on a meter and how they interact with the environment. <br />
<br />
As for myself I pay a lot of attention to those guild or people in guilds that are on my own realm when I am in the LFR. I like to see how they handle themselves and see if they are the bigger person and really want to help, than hurt the group of people that actually care for why they are there. If they immediately go into jerk mode, then I usually steer clear of interacting with both them and their guild, since after all they are a representative of the guild and if they are on the raid team well that says a lot about them as a whole. <br />
<br />
I considered going back to raiding this expansion after taking a break from doing so in MoP, but between how I see people interacting both in the world and the LFR. I can't bring myself to the people where I want to even bother. I am foremost a people person and I very much enjoy interacting with others, but with every passing day I play in this game now. I mostly stay within the guilds that I am in or solo whatever content I can on my own. I have done few things through the group finder, but mainly those are apexis group dailies or the occasional world boss. <br />
<br />
Yea, I get what you are saying. I do feel that as mind numbing of the experience of the LFR is, its just better than having to listen to 9 or more other people problems or what they can and cannot or won't do for the guild. The experience I had in Cata with raiding was far different than the one I had over BC and Wrath. The raiding guild I was in during Cata was pretty much doom from the start, the guild leader and few others were friends, so I stuck it out to the bitter end. We had a few that never did anything but show up on raid night, contributed nothing at all the rest of the week, but were always the first to have a problem or bitch and complain. <br />
<br />

its better for us all! <br />
<br />
for the game, for the players and for you!<br />
<br />
What? Leave it out, I just dropped £30 on this thing, it'd be an even worse expansion if they ended it as quickly as possible, due to y'know us all having just dropped £30 on it. Seriously dude, QUIT THE GAME if you don't like it. Every single day you're on here moaning about how much the game is shite yet you still hang around! What, you like throwing money down the toilet for something you don't like?<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, I could care less for the feature as long as our gear still looks like garbage. Update the models all you want. They remain appearing terrible with those ghetto ass kicks on. Seriously, I thought it was strange for them to put so much effort and time into new models only to outfit them with horrendously outdated gear concepts. Now we simply look like high-res versions of 2004, the leap is minimal feeling at best. Then take a gander at Tyrande, Thrall, Sylvanas, etc... that gear needs to be common for the players. Otherwise it really was all for naught.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tyrande, Thrall, Sylvanas look like that in order to stand out because they're major lore characters. We can't ALL look as special as the major lore characters, otherwise noone looks special. What's &quot;outdated&quot; about the new gear? I can understand perhaps not liking it, but I have no idea how it's &quot;outdated&quot; as concepts.<br />
<br />
Also, how much less could you care for the feature?</div></div><hr />

As for myself I pay a lot of attention to those guild or people in guilds that are on my own realm when I am in the LFR. I like to see how they handle themselves and see if they are the bigger person and really want to help, than hurt the group of people that actually care for why they are there. If they immediately go into jerk mode, then I usually steer clear of interacting with both them and their guild, since after all they are a representative of the guild and if they are on the raid team well that says a lot about them as a whole. <br />

I considered going back to raiding this expansion after taking a break from doing so in MoP, but between how I see people interacting both in the world and the LFR. I can't bring myself to the people where I want to even bother. I am foremost a people person and I very much enjoy interacting with others, but with every passing day I play in this game now. I mostly stay within the guilds that I am in or solo whatever content I can on my own.

Yea, I get what you are saying. I do feel that as mind numbing of the experience of the LFR is, its just better than having to listen to 9 or more other people problems or what they can and cannot or won't do for the guild. The experience I had in Cata with raiding was far different than the one I had over BC and Wrath. The raiding guild I was in during Cata was pretty much doom from the start, the guild leader and few others were friends, so I stuck it out to the bitter end. We had a few that never did anything but show up on raid night, contributed nothing at all the rest of the week, but were always the first to have a problem or bitch and complain. <br />

<br />
i have never really considered myself a hardcore raider, and i have never been one either. when wod hit, i wanted to dedicate my time to actually get into proper raiding, but more than often i have met the door hard than making progress. endless drama and people being assholes is what i have been forced to deal with recently. my last guild was trying get a stable raiding team, but people started to leave the guild. it came to a point where my GM decided to quit the game, and the guild disbanded. it has just come to a point where i feel like its just a huge waste of time. it might be that i have been unlucky, but after those first hand experiences i might just give up. tried to pug for awhile, but i cant even get into groups that dosent quit halfway in. its tough, and to be fair i cant really blame those who dont want to make an comitment to it. its just way too painfull to get the ball rolling.</div></div><hr />

That's my character on FFXIV. Now that's an interesting, well-detailed outfit. Especially when referencing the robes specifically.<br />
<br />
So you're telling me on WoW I have to be relegated to a one-piece, full-body, painted on piece of shit because I'd be too cool comparatively against the main characters of the game? That is literally the lamest excuse I have ever heard someone come up with in the defense of... well... anything! Why not have them stand out on their own merits and what they bring to the story versus the idea that they'll stand out purely upon the basis of their outfit? <br />
<br />
...This, above all other issues, is why I've left WoW. Tired of the excuses. If it isn't Blizzard it's the players making it for them. No matter how absurd.</div></div><hr />

At the beginning of MoP I moved to another realm and decided I needed a very long break and I been on that break ever since.<br />
<br />
This very similar to the decision I made, going into WoD. I used LFR a lot in MoP, and was sick to the teeth of the PUG and LFR bullies and loudmouths and crybabies. I tried fighting back, but the tide was too strong - every group had at least one, who thought it was okay to mock others for their gear, or gems, or recount numbers, who would start demanding DPS be kicked for any reason, who refused to explain fights, and then would fail the chat with &quot;fucking bads&quot; and &quot;You all suck!&quot; with the inevitable wipe. Run your own group? They still show up. Threaten them? They pull the boss and leave, like children, or refuse to leave the instance. The 10 year olds I have run into in the game act more maturely than these guys. <br />
<br />
I saw just more of the same in WoD, so I decided, no PUG or raiding in WoD. I'm done with it, for now. Little did I know, that was the only thing to do, post 100. The idea of sitting in a raid for 10 minutes while &quot;My tank alt&quot; screams at &quot;my other tank alt&quot; over talents or gear or whatever the hell bug crawled up their ass that day makes my teeth bleed from gritting them. I'm not going to carry these pricks by joining their groups, life is too short. <br />
<br />
The only way it will change is if the players tell them bluntly that their behavior is unacceptable, and remove them from groups - but it's a losing battle, because all the good players have left, or are too terrified to speak for fear of getting the attention of the bullies - and all the new players are encouraged to act like that, because there's no repercussions for any of them. <br />
<br />
I came into WoD already disgusted with this kind of players, and not wanting to bother sharing a single moment or goal with them, which is why WoD's lack of content was harder to take - it's one thing to have less to do - but it fucking sucks when you know the few things left are riddled with asshole bullies, douchebags, and personality disorders.</div></div><hr />

Should just be 10-man normal and 10-man heroic, no reason to really have anything else.<br />

you are just reinforcing my point, the only people getting recruits are already established mythic guilds.<br />
<br />
<br />
You claimed that &quot;the only people getting recruits are already established Mythic guilds&quot;. I just wanted to disprove your point. Yes, established guilds have it easier but it's not impossible for new guilds.<br />
<br />
I don't mean to insult. But from what you are saying I can only assume that your server has too many guilds at the same level. This can only be fixed by merges or guilds disbanding.<br />
<br />
But I do apologize for claiming that you don't put in enough effort. You probably are, I can't know. Maybe you aren't ready to sacrifice enough (i.e. your guild identity).<br />

<br />
I think its is a total waste of art dept and raid team assets to design gear and new mechanics for ~2% of the player base, an utter waste.<br />
<br />
I understand that. You are free to have that opinion being a paying customer. But there are almost 2000 guilds that killed bosses in BRF Mythic. Considering rosters of ~25 that's 50'000 people. Sure, it's a small minority but still 50'000*15€*12=9'000'000€ per year. I don't know if that can really be called a waste of resources from a business perspective.<br />

My bad for not being clear once again. I was not really trying to justify the existence of 4 difficulties (or at least it wasn't my intention) but I was trying to say that Mythic is justified even if it is only played by a minority of players. I wouldn't mind if we only had Mythic and Normal. Or hell, call it heroic if you wish, just has to be a fixed size that is clearly above 15. So I'm basically saying the same as you do.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You do realize how ridiculous that sounds right?<br />
<br />
I'd argue that you can make more difficult content for a 10-man than a 25-man because you can more intensely focus your numbers and mechanics. I know when I was doing 25 it felt like there was a lot more room for error than in a 10. So the higher number of players does not, at all, make content anymore difficult or better. In fact often the opposite.<br />
<br />
The point of having smaller groups though is to even the playing field more for all guilds. It's much more difficult to get 20 consistent players together than 10 and on top of that, your unity is stronger with a smaller pool. <br />
<br />
Want 'epic fights' with 'loads of people'? Do a world boss. Instanced content is meant to be a more focused, trialing experience.</div></div><hr />

The only thing new that is being added to it is the dying option (previously you bought dyes and applied them to each separate item), and they are now using a feature akin to Diablo 3 where any item you acquire has its appearance automatically added for transmog use. I think it's a great update, WoW needs to follow suit. Void Storage is too small and a hassle to move things between. God knows we'll never have dyes in WoW.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arbs</div><div class="date">2015-03-27, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I honestly don't know why they don't just simply make all raid content 10-man. It's easier for many larger guilds to do two 10-man teams than for small guilds to do one 20-man. At this time I'd simply trash LFR, Flex, and go to a 10-man normal to heroic setup. Then spend more time working on my dungeons to make their heroic versions more difficult with greater reward/opportunity for progression for those that just can't get into the raiding scene.<br />
<br />
Right now dungeons are about pointless. LFR is about pointless. Mythic is about pointless. Why? Because they either don't really provide the game much of anything or are so remotely accessed they might as well be a non-feature for 90% of the population. This is why the game feels so featureless right now. This is honestly one of the most poorly managed endgames to date.<br />
<br />
Bolster your non-raiding content and paths of progression. Simplify and downsize raiding content for easier assembling of teams. <br />
<br />
Your idea would do more harm than good. FF14 is a good game, but it raiding is the weakest part of the game &amp; doesn't represent a good challenge. There's a reason people rather raid in WoW or Wildstar. They atleast represent a challenge.<br />
<br />
I will respect this as your opinion, but IMO it is a bad one. <br />
<br />
What Blizzard should do is Combine Normal / Heroic into a Uldaur style mode. Have 3 modes: LFR, N/H - (Ulduar Style) &amp; Mythic. <br />
<br />
LFR &amp; N/H is Flex, clearly people are clueless on why they picked 20 man for Mythic with no Flex. It was suppose to only be fore the established Hardcore Guilds &amp; not for everyone.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">goblingirl</div><div class="date">2015-03-27, 08:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The boss completion charts are very interesting. Far fewer people have killed bosses in BRF as compared to how many had killed bosses in SoO a few months into that raid. FAR fewer people. So that means people are dropping out of raiding (cancelling accounts too? Hard to say.) <br />
<br />
And there's a giant dropoff from Highmaul to BRF. Given that all of the BRF bosses are open and the LFR wings have been open for weeks/over a month for the oldest of them, you would think the participation rate would be higher.<br />
<br />
I can only speak for myself, but I did raid Highmaul to completion. I raided in BRF for a few weeks and got all bosses down but Blackhand, and then drifted off 3 weeks ago from disinterest. I wasn't enjoying BRF so I stopped going. I didn't enjoy Highmaul much either. I really don't know why... I raided SoO for over a year and I got cloaks on 5 characters over the course of MoP. I took all those characters into Heroic SoO and geared them up over that year. I've raided since Molten Core so I don't think the problem is that I don't like to raid. Honestly HM and BRF rank among the least enjoyable raids for me ever, save perhaps Dragon Soul which was rock bottom horrid.<br />
<br />
I can hardly be bothered to take my main into BRF, and I will never take an alt there save enough runs to get the ring runes, if I even bother doing rings for alts (and I may wait to see if they do some sort of better catch-up buff like they did for cloaks). I dunno.</div></div><hr />

FF14 is a good game, but it raiding is the weakest part of the game &amp; doesn't represent a good challenge. There's a reason people rather raid in WoW or Wildstar. They atleast represent a challenge.<br />
<br />
I will respect this as your opinion, but IMO it is a bad one. <br />
<br />
What Blizzard should do is Combine Normal / Heroic into a Uldaur style mode. Have 3 modes: LFR, N/H - (Ulduar Style) &amp; Mythic. <br />
<br />
LFR &amp; N/H is Flex, clearly people are clueless on why they picked 20 man for Mythic with no Flex. It was suppose to only be fore the established Hardcore Guilds &amp; not for everyone. That way fights can be tuned for a certain quota &amp; not be easier cause they have to tune for both 10 &amp; 25 man.<br />
<br />
<br />
1) Raiding is the strongest part of the game if you're not on an RP server. Coil is extremely well done and enjoyable. Mind you, my favorite raid in WoW was Ulduar. Beyond that and maybe ICC - I'd argue Binding Coil is better than anything WoW has produced, especially as of late. T13 of Final Coil requires a great deal of min-maxing and making the most of your teams.<br />
<br />
2) WoW hasn't represented a challenge for me in years so I don't know where you're coming with this. That said, I can't count on one hand how many guilds I've been in on WoW that never could grasp the most simple of rules when it comes to raiding. That is, &quot;Don't stand in the fire!&quot; -- you'd be surprised how quickly you can get stuck on the first or second boss of a normal raid that is really not a challenge at all.<br />
<br />
Therefore, me like many won't ever get to do heroics. So it's ultimately non-content as far as I'm concerned. If I could clone myself 10+ times, sure. Just doesn't work like that and I'm not going to spend my time screaming at moms and their kids -- getting too old for that shit.<br />
<br />
That is before we get into art assets, mechanics, and the overall enjoyable nature of the raids themselves. Which for WoD is probably the lowest it has ever been. They simply aren't putting forth the effort they once did.<br />
<br />
3) Simplifying things down to normal and heroic of the same size would actually free up resources significantly and make balancing a lot more easy. Normal is for your everyday players while heroic is an obscene version of it and leave it at that. There's really nothing difficult to grasp about the idea and I personally think it's a damn good one.<br />
<br />
Instead now you have several difficulties of the same pile of steaming shit that spreads out resources, confuses players, and really doesn't add anything to the overall experience. If it did I'd still be playing WoW versus FFXIV. I didn't switch games just to make a fashion statement concerning their crappy looking gear. I did it because I was honestly uninspired and left without motivation.</div></div><hr />

- Art design is different for all games, I never cared about WoW art as it just cartoony like Wildstar &amp; SWTOR. I think Rift has ugly art others love it. I love GW2 Art even though the armor can look ugly at times, but also amazing.<br />
<br />
- But Yes I have heard that line before from people &amp; friends who now play FF14, yet they never attempted or even completed Heroic before. Not my fault you can't get into a better guild. People will flock to the easier content, we see it in WoW now. But i'm not here to convince you what you may already know. <br />
<br />
- Raiding is not the strongest part of FF14 maybe Crystal Tower &amp; World of Darkness are interesting &amp; a better LFR than what WoW has. But FF14's raiding for sure is the weakest. Good raiding, but FF14 has alot of better things running for it than raiding. I don't even consider Primals or Coil actual Raid content. I can't stand 8-10 man raiding I have always been a fan of 20 &amp; 25 man raiding. I did 40 man raiding in Vanilla but wasn't up for it in Wildstar <br />
<br />
You gain a different mindset &amp; opinion of Raiding in WoW to others MMOs, when you have actually experienced the hard modes or now hard modes. You learn to appreciate the raiding. <br />
<br />
- WoW has been simplified more than anough, if they went back to a Normal / Heroic only format. Heroic would most likely 20 man only &amp; Normal being flex 10-30. But why would you remove LFR when many players do participate in it. I don't &amp; never will, but their are players who enjoy it regardless of how bad it is. If Blizzard turned back time maybe they could fix the mess they caused, but now it is something that needs to be embraced.<br />
<br />
3 Difficulty in a current WoW scenario is how it would have to be with: LFR / N-H (Ulduar Style) &amp; Mythic. <br />
<br />
LFR for the casual players wanting to see the content, N-H for the friends / pug groups &amp; Mythic for the established groups that are capable of doing Mythic content. <br />
<br />
- But my question to you is why does it matter what WoW does when you play FF14 &amp; you think it is better. Why look back &amp; try to change things that would harm the game more than help it. Removing LFR &amp; Mythic would hurt the game more than just leaving them be.<br />
<br />
All your ideas are great in the mindset of FF14 being a very casual / pug friendly game, WoW is pretty casual itself. But it does have a hardcore Raid community that has continued to chug along for the past 10 years &amp; prbly the most competitive players &amp; guild in it's community out of all the MMOs available.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because I've been playing WoW for ten years and it keeps drifting further and further into a territory that I and many others aren't interested in. I genuinely despise and loathe what the game has become to the point I am enraged at the developers, developers that I want to love, and gained a seething hatred for a game that was my world once upon a time. I own all the books for Warcraft. I own the Monopoly game. It was, for a long time, THE game for me.<br />
<br />
It has ruined itself in my eyes and continues to degrade its own standing with each new expansion it seems like. Not only are they going in undesirable directions but not doing much to bolster other aspects despite really having all the talent and resources to do so. It's very upsetting and beyond disappointing.<br />
<br />
Removing LFR and Mythic wouldn't hurt the game. It'd greatly help it if it was combined with other strategies. Instead, because that's literally all they have, yeah - if you remove shit from shit well, you have less shit! At least for many more shit is better than less shit but it doesn't change the fact it's all shit to begin with! Now I'm making myself laugh but my reasoning is solid. They've just really neglected a lot of their game and now you can't even talk about simplifying the ridiculous difficulty settings to two better optimized standards without people screaming bloody murder.<br />
<br />
Also, Coil is very strong in FFXIV because it's all anyone just about gears up for -- there is a very keen desire to clear it and gain the gear from it. Just like you do in WoW. The difference is the systems in place and the side material makes the game much more healthier and robust over all. It isn't JUST coil and then you basically beat your meat off into a bush otherwise.</div></div><hr />

No removing LFR &amp; Mythic would hurt the game, you don't understand what problems it would cause. Regardless of my huge dislike of LFR, they're players who enjoy it &amp; removing it those players would basically have no reason for them to play &amp; same goes with Mythic It is part of the game now, I rather Arenas get removed for the severe lack of balance they have caused to the game, but it is part of the game.. I rather WoW not become more of a single player game other than allowing casual to do LFR. But less single player experiences that you can in do FF14 or more guild / group based content is what I want. We have to many queues system I don't want more.<br />
<br />
The one thing I wish came back is the need for a guild &amp; wanting to get better so you can do the content. Sadly that isn't FF14, that is why I don't raid in it, but I still enjoy the story &amp; primal fights :D.<br />

<br />
The boss completion charts are very interesting. Far fewer people have killed bosses in BRF as compared to how many had killed bosses in SoO a few months into that raid. FAR fewer people. So that means people are dropping out of raiding (cancelling accounts too? Hard to say.) <br />
<br />
And there's a giant dropoff from Highmaul to BRF. Given that all of the BRF bosses are open and the LFR wings have been open for weeks/over a month for the oldest of them, you would think the participation rate would be higher.<br />
<br />
I can only speak for myself, but I did raid Highmaul to completion. I raided in BRF for a few weeks and got all bosses down but Blackhand, and then drifted off 3 weeks ago from disinterest. I wasn't enjoying BRF so I stopped going. I didn't enjoy Highmaul much either. I really don't know why... I raided SoO for over a year and I got cloaks on 5 characters over the course of MoP. I took all those characters into Heroic SoO and geared them up over that year. I've raided since Molten Core so I don't think the problem is that I don't like to raid. Honestly HM and BRF rank among the least enjoyable raids for me ever, save perhaps Dragon Soul which was rock bottom horrid.<br />
<br />
I can hardly be bothered to take my main into BRF, and I will never take an alt there save enough runs to get the ring runes, if I even bother doing rings for alts (and I may wait to see if they do some sort of better catch-up buff like they did for cloaks). I dunno.<br />
<br />
We feel the same way in some sense I have bee raiding since MC &amp; I have wanted to stop raiding myself. But it isn't the game just myself thinking holy crap I have been playing for 10 years when does it stop.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, my only complaint about FFXIV is the lack of emphasis on guilds clearing content. That said it's namely due to the fact that you have 'Linkshells' which act like guilds in their own right and make running content that much easier. It's not, at all, a reflection on how easy coil is -- not even close. We've simply got more options and available resources for us to utilize. Where as WoW, if your guild isn't progressing, well, you aren't progressing either. Not the case in FFXIV.<br />
<br />
I like that and then I don't. I would like to see something more rewarded for progressing with your guild versus a linkshell. Even if it simply vanity.<br />
<br />
However, LFR serves no purpose right now. It's gear is shite. It's entire existence rather pointless except being a tour -- which, as mentioned before, Youtube or Twitch could provide all the same with likely greater excitement. Let's face it, when a quarter of your LFR group is AFK, another quarter ignorant of the mechanics, and you're still clearing it without breaking a sweat what's the point?<br />
<br />
Then dungeons. WHY ARE THEY EVEN MAKING DUNGEONS ANYMORE?! Again so easy they're not fun at all. They're largely unimaginative. Then you have like little reason to clear themn. I don't understand at all what they're doing with this game. Even from a casual's perspective it's wonky as hell. The only content worth doing right now is the raids themselves beyond LFR and that's if you can get past the fact that most regard the current raids as some of the most pitiful and uninteresting to date.</div></div><hr />

We agree on many things, but as much as we want change it will not happen as we know Blizzard will no sacrifice subs. If they were willing too. LFR would of been gone along time ago. Ya Dungeons are useless it is very sad that we can't have interesting dungeons anymore. The reality of WoW that we have now will mostly result in dungeons getting a Timewalker mode that allows us to do all dungeons at max level just mentored down. <br />
<br />
Honest I don't know what Blizzard is gunna do, but all I care about is raiding. An the day it comes I'm down with WoW. Could be soon or later on counts on how much longer I want to raid than I will mostly be done with raiding MMOs. But that is just me, good talk &amp; civil discussion I enjoyed it :).<br />

I think the main problem is they made LFR so pointless. The gear is shit and the drop rate for the legendary doodads are awful. It is also utterly boring. I think the grand plan to get people into other difficulties of raiding has back fired big time. LFR was the most popular raiding by a country mile and they made it so bad a good chunk of people don't bother.

It is the same reason that the legendary ring percentages are so god awful. You have to wait weeks for terrible drop rates and less drops.<br />
<br />
Yeah.<br />
<br />
Further to all that though, and what I said before, too. Raiding participation is lower in the face of a reported higher subscription rate. That is interesting, too. They went from a little over 7 million subscriptions to 10 million subscriptions, and somehow fewer of those people are bothering to raid Highmaul, and even far fewer are bothering to raid BRF. I'm sure it's down to a lot of stuff - other things in game to do, the gear is mediocre at best, and these raid zones are both boring as hell. But it's really a sharp drop off, especially when you consider how much higher the subscription base is per Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

I've always wondered why WoW gets top billing on this site when it's called MMO Champ. Does Blizzard own part of this?<br />
<br />
No it is owned by Curse, but the Admins choose to post WoW / Blizzard related news &amp; it is a WoW focused fan site with A Video Games section that has other game thread, but not to the depth of what they do for WoW. Curse promotions also do pop up on the front page too. <br />
<br />
It is called MMO-Champion, but it could be called WoW-Champion as it is a WoW focused fan site, but it does post the odds news about other games, when WoW news is very low you can tell when Chaud does the graphs.</div></div><hr />

This site really should try and be more of a proper MMO page and less of a WoW satellite. Then they wouldn't have these lulls where they have to put up such things. I really don't get why they call themselves 'MMO Champion' and then primarily report on just one to the point of it nearly being exclusive. Seems a bit silly does it not?<br />
<br />
Hell, it doesn't even need to about all MMOs. Like MMORPG does articles on every game from the genre and it really ends up kind of cluttered and trashy. Hit up some of the biggest titles like SWtoR, FFXIV, GW2, WoW, etc. You can keep it classy, focused, but expansive enough to avoid being little more than a straight up fan-site.</div></div><hr />

LOL . Insane much? LFR was made so your grand-dad who cant focus or press his buttons fast enough to experience the lore/story of the game. Is LFR doing it's job? Yes. It sounds like the people who were too shit for normals and only had LFR last year are the ones crying about it. I dont know.<br />
Has mythic/old heroic been for the 1% ? Yes .... <br />
If you're a regular guy you shouldn't even think about mythic , you are just not good enough and that's fine. We have 4 freaking difficulties for every single type of person, more then we have ever had and people STILL bitch, cry and moan about it. I think the only failure this xpac was that heroic dungeons are not doing a good enough job to prepare people for raiding ( and dont call LFR raiding please.. It will never be that )</div></div><hr />
