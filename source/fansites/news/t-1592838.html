It looks like you won't need the cloak for Ordos (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/511942709092052993) anymore either!<br />
As your journey takes you from Pandaria to Draenor, we wanted to extend one last opportunity to obtain your Legendary Cloak—and share some important updates related to this iconic item. <br />
<br />
Legendary Cloak Changes: Once More unto the Breach<br />
As a part of the transition from Mists of Pandaria to Warlords of Draenor, we’ll be making some changes to the Legendary Cloak quest line and ultimately closing it out as players head into the new expansion. Once the quest is fully closed, the item will no longer be attainable, and the cloak will become a symbol of the great deeds you’ve accomplished in Mists of Pandaria.<br />
<br />
With the release of the pre-expansion patch (6.0.2), players who are not already on the journey through this quest line will no longer be able to begin it. We will also be removing the Test of Valor step with patch 6.0.2 as a part of our transition from using Valor as a currency.<br />
<br />
Once Warlords of Draenor launches on November 13, the Legendary Cloak quest line will be gone entirely—the quests and the cloak will no longer be obtainable, and any related in-progress quests will be cleared from your log.<br />
<br />
But when one door closes, another door opens. In Warlords of Draenor, players will have the opportunity to earn a new Legendary item available exclusively in the new expansion: Khadgar’s Band of the Archmage (http://beta.wowdb.com/items/armor/rings?filter-search=spellbound).<br />
<br />
The Gaze of the Black Prince: One Last Look<br />
If you haven’t yet earned your Legendary Cloak, you still have one final opportunity to make accelerated progress on your quest. Rather than end the Gaze of the Black Prince buff on Tuesday, September 16 (as previously announced), the buff will remain active until the release of the Warlords of Draenor pre-patch (6.0.2). This buff increases the reputation gained with the Black Prince by 100%. It also increases the chance of obtaining items from his foes needed as a part of the Legendary Cloak quest line, including Secrets of the Empire, Sigil of Wisdom, Sigil of Power, and Titan Runestones.<br />
<br />
Good luck on your quest, but remember that your voyage doesn’t end here. Soon, you’ll be setting your sights on the new Legendary item, Khadgar’s Band of the Archmage, in Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Heirloom Vendor Change in Patch 6.0.2<br />
Heirlooms in the Warlords of Draenor beta currently have some gold prices (http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/52037-zulna#related:sells;_!) associated with them, but the prices may not be final. You will still be able to get the shields and offhands from the Darkmoon Faire (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/511930566610939904). <br />
With the upcoming release of Patch 6.0.2, we’ll be sending the vendors who sell Heirlooms for Justice Points on a nice vacation.<br />
<br />
As you might already be aware, both Justice and Valor Points are being removed as currencies from the game in 6.0.2. As we started to work on new ways to buy Heirlooms, we found that we were setting their value up for a rollercoaster ride. That's because we’re also working on a larger Heirloom system for a future patch, and we don’t want to introduce an interim pricing scheme that could temporarily devalue Heirlooms or limit how we’d be able to give them out in the future. Rather than make players face buyer’s remorse and hand-wringing decisions about when to buy, we’re going to give the Justice Heirloom vendors some time off while we work on improving the system as a whole.<br />
<br />
One thing to note is that this change only affects vendors that sell Heirlooms for Justice. PvE Heirlooms will still remain available at the Darkmoon Faire and the Trial of the Crusader, and PvP Heirlooms will continue to be available for Honor.</div></div><hr />

Might want to ask a dev on this - Some clarification would be nice, although as far as I can tell it should just be obtainable from the quest after A Test of Valor.</div></div><hr />

(Like if you run LFR, you should be able to run LFR and get the drops even after you've gotten them once during the week). It's the only way to let people finish the quests who are on it, but are at the mercy of the RNG gods. At this point I don't think it should be an issue to let it be done by everyone else (or however many alts they have).<br />
<br />
But I'm sure I'm the only one in that frame of mind. /shrug.</div></div><hr />

I mean, I'm glad they're extending the Black Prince buff, my mage is at 6/12 runestones as of today and I still have to do the first two wings of SoO. That being said, I knew I wouldn't have time to work on this on my druid that hit 90 a week and a half ago, and I was really wanting to be able to go back and work on it after the expansion.<br />
<br />
So this greatly saddens me. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

I like the idea of not being able to get that AQ mount or Naxx staff, or the current legendary cloak. Don't see why people get hung up on it. It's nice to have items that are out of reach.<br />
<br />
Showing off unobtainable items to those &quot;special snowflake's&quot; is priceless. You know how much they want them and know they can't every have them. Makes you more special than them for a few seconds at least :D 1up for the vet players with less time to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Legendaries cease to have any meaning if they become transmog sources, being in effect epics with another colour.<br />
Though in some ways, they aren't much different already.<br />
This unusual move of removing the ability to earn it at a higher level means it maintains a certain amount of value, whatever the &quot;thoughts&quot; are on difficulty.<br />
Legendaries have always had more of an RNG aspect than &quot;skill&quot;.<br />
Your performance in a a fight does not mean better odds of required loots.<br />
Someone with world ranking dps is just as likely to see a certain item drop as someone who is being carried.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rae888</div><div class="date">2014-09-16, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Considering the length of time it takes to finish this quest chain, they really should have made this announcement earlier. Anyone who hasn't started it at this point will never be able to get it now. (Doing A Test of Valor now from the start alone will take you up to 6.0.2 probably).<br />
<br />
I know, someone will say &quot;you had 2 years to finish it!&quot; That's right, but it's not the point. Someone may have been planning to get it at some point in the future--for an alt, or just for looks, or because Blizzard had promised that the valor portion would be skipped in the future while the rest of the quest remained, or whatever--and thought they could do it at a leisurely pace, but now they're out of luck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is what bugs me about it. Once the test of valor goes away, we'll effectively have just over a month (if we're lucky) to finish the entire rest of the legendary quest chain. And since 6.0 also removes the black prince buff, you basically have to pray to whatever deity you follow that your titan runestones and secrets drop with relatively high frequency to finish the cloak before WoD.<br />

Yeah, it sounds a bit odd of them to do that...maybe they'll increase it to guaranteed drops during that time, hopefully for the unlucky at least.<br />

To be fair, if someone had the black bug and wasn't using it, I'd question their choices.</div></div><hr />

I don't care about any of the so-called prestige, it's just a shame that new or returning players won't be able to experience the storyline. Considering all the work put into it by the writers, quest designers and voice actors, removing it seems like a pointless waste.<br />
<br />
I agree, a new player should be able to experience it (or even just someone who didn't do it). Just as a new player can still experience the ICC questline.</div></div><hr />

Once the test of valor goes away, we'll effectively have just over a month (if we're lucky) to finish the entire rest of the legendary quest chain. And since 6.0 also removes the black prince buff, you basically have to pray to whatever deity you follow that your titan runestones and secrets drop with relatively high frequency to finish the cloak before WoD.<br />
<br />
And if you don't? Lots of wasted effort!<br />
<br />
The black prince buff stays until WoD is released. So essentially you will have a month with the buff and no valor wait/restriction. Should be super easy.<br />

Rather than end the Gaze of the Black Prince buff on Tuesday, September 16 (as previously announced), the buff will remain active until the release of the Warlords of Draenor pre-patch (6.0.2).<br />

The same time as the Test of Valor goes away, so too does the Gaze of the Black Prince.</div></div><hr />

gaining rep is fine, all it takes is about 2 hours or so of grinding in Isle of Thunder to get exalted. But RNG is very<br />
VERY dreadful in this game. Nothing sucks more than doing a RF, or just anything and getting either nothing or<br />
doubles of the same exact thing. Especially if you spend coins or tokens to reroll and STILL getting the same<br />
exact thing. It's incredibly demoralizing. And since this quest requires you to get large numbers of coins and<br />
tokens (and most RF dungeons have about 3 bosses total) it takes quite a bit of time. Nothing sucks more than<br />
doing those three and getting nothing to show for it. Leaves you to wonder just how much of a bump in coin<br />
drops the buff is supposed to give.<br />
<br />
The Valor buff was poorly handled. Even though sure, an extra 100% was fine, especially since it stacked with the<br />
max valor buff on all your alts, but WHY did it still have a valor cap? All it did was essentially force players to spend<br />
3 weeks to getting the quest completed.</div></div><hr />

not everyone is playing the game all the time. personally i only played a few months at the beginning of MoP and that was it. cloak is lame and everybody and their mother has it but still. removing it seems kind of unnecessary. keeping the insane tittle even though like 50% of the requirements no longer existed in the game was fine though. kinda makes you wonder what goes through their heads sometimes</div></div><hr />

2. MoP is changing, lore wise Garrosh has done the plot and moved on, it would be retarded lore wise to keep it as current <br />
3. RNG is dedication and effort, you are investing time</div></div><hr />

this questline is RNG? i don't think you quite understand RNG.<br />

sure you can be faster/slower than others based on RNG but everyone who tries will 100% complete this quest and obtain the cloak.</div></div><hr />

Adding unnecessary exclusivity to something that does not, nor should not be exclusive.

<br />
What's next, can't gain any mythic mogging gear or achievements after the expansion is over to offer more artificial exclusivity, while also shoe-horning as many players as possible into Mythic raiding while it's still relevant content so they can show off to their investors that making a mythic difficulty isn't a bloody waste of time?</div></div><hr />

1. Wrathion is most definitely a villain or an anti-hero in WoD. Either he gives that up after seeing the abomination he created in the Iron Horde, or his writing just got a little more terrible.<br />
<br />
2. Yeah, and what about the countless other legendaries where the lore changed? Icecrown, Ulduar, everything has been plundered and has faded into the irrelevant, but their legendaries are maintained because they didn't involve the world around them to some slight degree?<br />

1. Irrelevant what reason is behind it, he remains in the current xpac<br />
2. All the story lines of previous legendarys ended lore wise. Either the main villain died in that raid, or the story is closed. Garrosh is still alive and still relevant in the story of WoD<br />
3. RNG in the very least requires you to run the said dungeon / raid at least once, cuz as u mentioned the drop isn't 100%. Even then it's time investment</div></div><hr />

Yeah that was the most annoying part the fact that you can't mog the cloaks, and in most cases if you have a nice armor mog set the cloak would clash with it big time.. The only way around it was to hide the cloak but really is a poor option..</div></div><hr />

Precisely they should either allow a massive speedup for peoples alts or make them account wide purchasable for alts.. Like they did with getting to Ordos on alts that don't have the cloak have the cloak on at least one toon to be able to buy it for alts..</div></div><hr />

I don't think they should remove the cloak questline entirely (and should have given much more notice if they were going to).<br />
<br />
But, the thing that enrages me is the buff only lasts until the patch and there won't be enough time from then until WoD comes out for anyone not already almost done to finish it.<br />
<br />
Last week, with the buff, one of my characters got only 4 runestones.<br />
<br />
I have several on Test of Valor now. There is no way without the buff that people not already probably well into secrets now can possibly get the cloak. <br />
<br />
Just so unfair to spring this at this late date.</div></div><hr />

I have a feeling they may change their stance (maybe) when people start to complain of wasted time and effort.. Since yes this has pretty much come out of nowhere and with the test of valor being as it is (stupid) there is no point starting the questline now for those who have not yet started it (not yet hit 90)..</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, I had alts on Test of Valor and wasn't in a hurry to get the Valor the past few weeks since I knew that I was going away. I thought I could finish Secrets and Runestones at my leisure. Had I know then questline would go away, I would have done it differently.</div></div><hr />

The cloak is not going to be replaced by a green, there is no green with an higher ilvl in WOD. Probably by level 100 dungeons gear, but you'll keep it for the whole leveling, and it's really REALLY OP while leveling.<br />

Heirlooms in the Warlords of Draenor beta currently have some gold prices (http://beta.wowdb.com/npcs/52037-zulna#related:sells;_!) associated with them, but the prices may not be final. You will still be able to get the shields and offhands from the Darkmoon Faire (https://twitter.com/nite_moogle/status/511930566610939904). <br />
With the upcoming release of Patch 6.0.2, we’ll be sending the vendors who sell Heirlooms for Justice Points on a nice vacation.<br />
<br />
As you might already be aware, both Justice and Valor Points are being removed as currencies from the game in 6.0.2. As we started to work on new ways to buy Heirlooms, we found that we were setting their value up for a rollercoaster ride. That's because we’re also working on a larger Heirloom system for a future patch, and we don’t want to introduce an interim pricing scheme that could temporarily devalue Heirlooms or limit how we’d be able to give them out in the future. Rather than make players face buyer’s remorse and hand-wringing decisions about when to buy, we’re going to give the Justice Heirloom vendors some time off while we work on improving the system as a whole.<br />
<br />
One thing to note is that this change only affects vendors that sell Heirlooms for Justice. PvE Heirlooms will still remain available at the Darkmoon Faire and the Trial of the Crusader, and PvP Heirlooms will continue to be available for Honor.<br />
<br />
Ex-fucking-cuse me? &quot;We're removing Heirlooms for now, because we don't want to devalue them or set their value up for a rollercoaster ride.&quot; Because making them only obtainable from the Argent Tournament and the Darkmoon Faire doesn't make their value skyrocket the fuck off the rollercoaster? WTF?</div></div><hr />

If you're currently on the Valor part, it is time gated, so you literally can do nothing - and 32 drops are after the Valor part. So.. lol? wtf? Sounds like they were trying to make it work, only they derped out and just took something out without even understanding how their own quest line works. This is idiotic.

What's the point of that. My alt on an alt server is at the start of the 3k valor. If I take the time to get that 3k the drop rate buff goes away &amp; getting the rest of the drops COMPLETELY sucks. WTG Blizz if I continue her on I see lots of wasted time &amp; effort if the RNG gods aren't generous.

I've got 2 months left to get one, so I don't think I have enough time to get it. I try to put effort into the raids and yet I still get bored out of my mind doing constant LFR, just for a chance to get the quest items.

My alt on an alt server is at the start of the 3k valor. If I take the time to get that 3k the drop rate buff goes away &amp; getting the rest of the drops COMPLETELY sucks. WTG Blizz if I continue her on I see lots of wasted time &amp; effort if the RNG gods aren't generous. Hell I have another alt that needs 1 more sigil of wisdom to finish that part, he ran 1st 2 wings of MV &amp; not 1 sigil dropped AT ALL with the damn buff. FAIL just FAIL imo.<br />

<br />
What i do mind is not removing test of valor now. Anyone not already past that point is just sol on the cloak now. I was planning on getting my 5th cloak on my rogue and she is just this week starting the valor quest so now it's pretty pointless to even bother as it's not doable at all.<br />
<br />
Removing the valor quest at 6.0.2 when anyone not already past it anyway will not have enough time to get the 32 drops they lack is pretty shitty. It's a meaningless change just meant to make ppl go &quot;hooray, it's gone&quot; until they realize it made no difference any longer any way.<br />

their sub numbers for q3 must be looking really really bad since htey have to resolve to such tricks - decision to remove proving grounds and legendary quest - clear desperation<br />

Nope, when 6.0.2 launches you will no longer be able to start it BUT those on it already will be able to finish it. Those people have until the actual launch of WoD to do it, when it goes live the quests will be cleared.<br />

They're taking away A Test of Valor in 6.02, but at that point it's basically too late for anyone on that part of the quest to get the legendary cloak before launch.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Cassidin</div><div class="date">2014-09-16, 10:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why not just let people who are on the quest line finish it? Like the Hand of A'dal title quest chain.<br />
<br />
Not hand of A'dal but.... I remember I was one maggy kill away from Champion of the Naaru on my second character when suddenly after saying it would go after Wrath came out - it was removed in the pre-patch 2 days before the scheduled maggy kill...... I was on the last stage of that one and it just &quot;went&quot;. They did keep the Hand of A'dal if you already had it (think they made a new version of the quest and only the old version if people still had it worked for Hand of A'dal) but they got rid of Champion of the Naaru even if you were just about to finish it back then - so this doesn't really surprise me (although I would rather they didnt get rid of the cloak quest)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since they had been hinting all along that the quest would not be removed, i.e: Removing the Valor portion of the quest in WoD.<br />
<br />
I still have yet to get my cloak on any of my characters but just figured I would go back and grab it at some point in a later expansion if legendaries became transmogable.<br />
<br />
Really not in the mood to re-subscribe before WoD pre-event just for the cloak now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The same time as the Test of Valor goes away, so too does the Gaze of the Black Prince.<br />
<br />
So basically.... if you get to that stage at that time.... you have about a month to get 20 then 12 runestones..... with no buff...... Even WITH the buff you have a good chance of not getting all 32 items in a month... without it.... forget it! Basically anyone who isnt already on the last stage (runestones) when 6.0.2 comes out - is VERY unlikely to complete it. removing the valor requirement is academic.... if you are just at that point come the pre-patch - it doesnt matter if you need the 3000 valor or not.... you wont get the cloak quest done either way.</div></div><hr />

Or will I be able to continue since I have already started the quest chain?<br />
<br />
If you are in the middle of Test of Valor when the WOD pre patch (patch 6.02) comes in then you will just continue the quest chain from whatever quest comes after that. You will either have Test of Valor removed from your quest log and replaced with the next quest or you will find Test of Valor removed from your quest log and you will just have to go and pick up the next quest Wrathion to continue.<br />
<br />
It's basically if you have started the legendary quest chain before patch 6.02 you have till WOD launch to finish it. If you haven't started the quest chain by patch 6.02 you can't start it. When WOD launches the quest chain is totally removed from the game even if you are part way through.<br />

<br />
Please don't be serious. You honestly think the reason they announced this now instead of, say a few months ago, is the proof its a sub ploy? Surely to whatever you pray to you understand the amount of stupidity it would be for a business to wait till the 'last minute' to announce something like this if their goal was to increase sub count (ESPECIALLY since sub counts are in intervals of one month...) before their next expansion hits.<br />
<br />
I understand your frustration on the matter since you seem to have a lot of alts, but lets be honest. If you unsubbed then you obviously do not care about it too much. This seems to be nothing more than like when a small child never plays with his GI Joe toy, but the MINUTE that neighbor kid wants to play with it, its a quick &quot;NO ITS MINE I WANT IT NOW!&quot;<br />

<br />
I mean, I'm glad they're extending the Black Prince buff, my mage is at 6/12 runestones as of today and I still have to do the first two wings of SoO. That being said, I knew I wouldn't have time to work on this on my druid that hit 90 a week and a half ago, and I was really wanting to be able to go back and work on it after the expansion.<br />
<br />
So this greatly saddens me. &gt;.&gt;<br />
<br />
This.<br />
<br />
I stopped subbing as I rejoined WoW late in MoP and I missed out on hitting exalted in Vial Eternal Blossoms by about two days of dailies. I started to feel disconnected from my char as I am a completest, but when I could no longer do something, it made me feel excluded from parts of the game.<br />
<br />
I personally think, if people are willing to spend the time, they should be able to complete legacy content. I bet once WoD gets to a null slow period pre-patch content...people will want to farm this chain on their alts.</div></div><hr />

I don't really understand this?<br />
<br />
Your a completest, but you have not been subbed long enough to complete exalted with Vial?<br />
<br />
Did you complete Full Heroic clears of all MoP raid?<br />
<br />
Brawlers Guild?<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds Endless?<br />
<br />
CM 9/9?<br />

Otherwise, you would end up with even more new players begging others, friends they make and what not, that if you loan them just a few K gold, they can get up to level 100 faster and help you out with your end level content... or just be able to pay you back with interest.<br />
<br />
Edit...<br />
<br />
For all of you saying you get a free level 90 boost. There will be people who will say that they used theirs on another realm, and it would take a new player a while to farm up that much gold.</div></div><hr />

I have some alts on the very first/second step of the chain and I wouldn't mind keeping the quest cycle, but I never put effort in these alts' cloak, and I will not care in 10 levels.</div></div><hr />

Yeah. It's only legendary if you happen to be the class that can use it! And who cares about the long grind it took to get the cloak. We need more legendary's like warglaives! Now THOSE were hard to get!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Will black prince rep still be obtainable after this quest line is removed?<br />
<br />
Will the vendor who sells replacement legendary items still be there, or do I have to buy any cloaks now whose effects I might want visually (for whatever reason) in the future?<br />
<br />
I believe the reputation is gonna stay. We still have Hydraxian Waterlords after all.<br />
Current CM sets will be available at the Shrine for those who got 9/9 with the character they're playing, throughout WoD; so I'd say they will still keep the quartermaster for those who finished the questline.</div></div><hr />

It's only a legendary if it's actually legendary to acquire. You shit on the Warglaives being &quot;easy&quot; but look at the effort required to even get to Illidan back in TBC, let alone kill him. There's nothing legendary about a pretty cloak all of the bads can wear because they wiped on LFR until the dumb stacks got high enough for them to kill the boss. The entire quest should have been restricted to heroic raiding, maybe only attainable for one person via a quest. That would be a legendary item.</div></div><hr />

Nope. Naxx 60 and I believe you got part of it from AQ too didn't you?<br />
<br />
In any case. Another thing to remove from the game. And as many others have said another, &quot;limited time only.&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't know why so many people refuse to see this as a potential marketing scheme. It's like people think that they are incapable of making decisions based on anything other than altruistic for the well-being of the player good intent.<br />
<br />
But on a non-argumentative note, I am mostly disappointed about the heirlooms. I was looking forward to buying the last few I didn't have with gold for in the future. But who knows when they'll actually make another class again with these annual mini-expansions they've got lined up.<br />
<br />
Not sure what the fiasco is with pricing. The prices they had weren't that expensive, and the cost of garrisons and recurring cost of mount training shows they obviously like having other ways to sink gold. So why remove another way to sink gold? <br />
<br />
Not sure that many people even need the heirlooms anymore though so it's probably not a huge deal. Not like you even really need them anymore at this point before level 80.</div></div><hr />

Showing off unobtainable items to those &quot;special snowflake's&quot; is priceless. You know how much they want them and know they can't every have them. Makes you more special than them for a few seconds at least :D 1up for the vet players with less time to play.<br />

You know, I quite like thinking of it that way. My only problem is I'd like to still be able to go back and redo some parts of it on a character that has the cloak. I actually enjoyed the 'Tank Trial'(was quite a shock to see Deathwing, and doing more than just 'get aggro')</div></div><hr />

Exactly. You can still grind your blades of azzinoth but this lame legendary needs to be locked and become a symbol of your deeds in MoP?<br />

The point was that there's barely any reason at all to make this a &quot;limited legendary&quot; other than hoping some &quot;scrubs&quot; as you call them would resub and finish it before MoP.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard is cutting so much stuff out of the game it's ridiculous. MoP CMs: Gone. MoP Brawler's Guild: Gone. And now MoP Legendary: Gone. Absolutely ridiculous.<br />
<br />
Aww you mad you're not going to be able to get the challenging stuff at ease when you out-level the content?</div></div><hr />

Every challenge has it's moment of glory, you get praised for your achievements if you complete them when it matters, no one cares if random guy #12946 beats tonight heroic lich king for the first time, what people cared about was the first kills some years ago. But our dear random guy will have fun killing it, he knows its not a big achievement, but he will enjoy it.<br />
<br />
With legendaries or almost any other aspect of the game this works the same way. There is a cool item, some cool lore, some cool title, mount, pet... whatever, that is no longer relevant, people know already that it doesn't have a lot of value at this point, but is always nice to have the chance to play that content, to live that content, it helps to build up your character, because even if my paladin was created during TBC she will always be the proud owner of Thunderfury, i don't care if i didn't obtain it when it was relevant, all i care about is the fun i had obtaining it.</div></div><hr />

Thing is tho, when it's a highly recognizable visual like the CM sets or unique looking legendaries, they feel just that much more special when they aren't held by just anyone. I think it's a good thing that people who actually managed to get them in time can have something recognizable in the time to come after the challenges are no longer available. With the cloak it's not -that- special since it's fairly easy to get over time, but it should still apply imho.<br />
<br />
I would love it if I ever saw someone in Stormwind with the cataclysm staff and thought &quot;wow, that guy did something awesome&quot;, instead it's pretty much just &quot;meh, probably just outleveled it&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Even if it's higly recognizable... the cool moment to wear that awesome paladin set was during MoP. I can't tell the amount of challenge runs we sold just by having our paladin standing all shiny with his set in the middle of the shrine :p he was the ad-guy.<br />
<br />
Those challenge sets will feel less and less special as we get further into new content, some day they'll release a new cool set and with time the awesome mop challenge mode set will just be a transmog option for a few players, no one will care about the effort to get it, no one will ask if the guy with the set paid for it or worked for it. All you'll have is an irrelevant part of the game blocked for many players. One day a new player (assuming we get new players :p) will ask how to get it and when he learns that he can't get it... the reaction won't be 'wow, that's awesome!'... the reaction will be 'that sucks'.<br />
<br />
All i'm saying is that exclusivity can't last forever.</div></div><hr />

And since as you say, there will be new cool sets etc and that these will just be an option, then again there is no real problem here, they can just work towards that one instead then, right? The only thing I hear in the complaints lately is people don't want to work for it when they are available, and are now pissed off they can't steamroll it later on, degrading the achievement of those who actually got it when it was hard.<br />
<br />
And i'm not talking about me here, let that be said. My only &quot;prestige&quot; item is the cloak, and like I said that one's not really that special. And quite frankly, those who work to get 100k to buy a boost run, they've worked for it as well in my eyes.</div></div><hr />

&lt;SARCASM&gt;<br />
Absolutely true! So please also remove all opportunities for people to enter lower level raids for transmog too please. They had plenty of time to get these items while the content was relevant and its far too late to be able to get it now. If you didn't play during BC and you want the warglaves or phoenix mount... too bad.. you should have got them when it was current.<br />
&lt;/SARCASM&gt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
It works both ways, if it's irrelevant then there's no real reason to remove it. The difference is that by keeping it, any player can return at any given time and get something cool to use however they want, maybe becuse they leveled up a new toon and would like to use that set, maybe because they didn't play during mop. But removing it will only cause that content to be gone forever and slowly forgotten, that's a shame for such a good sets.<br />
<br />
And just talking about the cloak, it's even funny because harder legendaries that required way more effort and even help from your guild mates have been aviable for years and will still be aviable, but they decided to give the 'exclusive' treatment to the welfare legendary that everybody can get just by raiding in any difficulty with exactly the same effort.</div></div><hr />

this is utter complete bs - there is milion of sets much nicer then cm sets - they were never distingusihing - its what sad pathetic nolifers tell themselves - blizzard take the route of pleasing such pathetic cretures - ok for me but im also super happy they will loose another milion or 2 subs over this stupid like hell changes - <br />
<br />
they are removing almost everything which they put in into mop making the question why the fuck they bother to put it in there in first place if they remove it - stupid decision which will hurt the game overall.<br />
<br />
and but the comment about overleving it - u just flipped a finger to thousands of people who daily farm old raid mounts - lets remove them all cause why not since we removing 3/4 of mop content - hell lets remove everything and let people only play WoD while starting on lv 90 cause why the hell not</div></div><hr />

In worst case, if they want to remove legendary cloak so much, then remove it, but keep the actual questline in place, make it reward not cloak but something else instead.<br />

Hey, why not remove all MOP (all its zones) as well? Make it so those who played it had something to be proud of - aka some stupid achievements which you can't get anymore, at the cost of actual chunk of game. Sounds stupid, doesn't it?

Atiesh. Try as you might you won't be getting that anymore.<br />
<br />
They should remove legendaries with the passing of content, retaining them in later content is trivial and cheapens the original intention of the item. If you don't retain it in the relevant content, they should pass on to history.</div></div><hr />
