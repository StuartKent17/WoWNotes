Its not a lock nerf, its a &quot;casttime increasing nerf&quot; its the same with slow and mind numbing. Hopefully we'll last a bit longer agains mutilate rogues though (not that it matters much, but still) =)</div></div><hr />

It kind of sucks for the fight being nerfed but it does help the people (such as myself that has done 10M 3D + 25M 3D) which is colour blind to it. Basically when someone says &quot;MOVE!&quot; etc I just move the hell out &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Sorry wheres the nerf?<br />
<br />
<br />
They placed an upper limit on how much extra energy Ferocious Bite can 'eat'. The conversion rate is an extra (9.4 + AP / 410) damage per point of extra energy.<br />
<br />
If you had 3000 AP, that works to 16.71 extra damage per energy, or 1086 more damage if used with a full energy bar.<br />
<br />
The upper limit of 30 energy cuts this to about half, or 501 more damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Where is the nerf to hunter explosive shot in pvp? Since mutilate took a hit I demand explosive shot get nerfed in PvP.<br />
<br />
<br />
Explosive Shot was already hotfix nerfed (as of last week?), the tooltip just hasn't caught up. It's possible the tooltip clarification either did not make it into this patch or just wasn't caught by the patch notes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, stop whining. It's a PvE/soloing buff and a PvP nerf.<br />
<br />
For those of you not willing to actually learn how to fight other classes in PvP, ret paladins took 3/3 Stoicism and only 2/3 Sanctified Seals. This gave Seals 96% dispel resistance, making them a pretty damned nice dispel buffer for the RNG to play around with.<br />
<br />
That's gone. No more dispel buffering. They need to be cast less now. Good times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did you somehow miss the &quot;Divine Plea: The amount healed by your spells is reduced by 50% (up from 20%) but the effect can no longer be dispelled.&quot; Ergo, every Holy Paladin gives the opposite team a free Mortal Strike at the best possible time (when the pally is running out of mana). Divine Plea being undispellable changes nothing - between Sacred Shield and all the other random crap buffs up, it was effectively undispellable before even without Stoicism.<br />
<br />
As a bonus, it also nerfs Retribution's Art of War procs and Divine Storm healing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This, to say it's been hotfixed is ridiculous and you probably haven't pvp'd if you think its not overpowered.<br />
<br />
Also whats with all the retards whining about 30minute seals?<br />
I play a prot paladin and its annoying as hell having to rebuff during your tanking rotation instead of using defensive gcds, think for one fricking second before you assume its just a ret buff.</div></div><hr />

* The duration on all Seals has been increased to 30 minutes and can no longer dispelled.<br />
* Divine Plea: The amount healed by your spells is reduced by 50% (up from 20%) but the effect can no longer be dispelled.<br />
* Sanctified Seals: This talent no longer affects dispel resistance, but continues to affect crit chance.<br />

Point out what helped a ret pally.<br />
<br />
#1? No<br />
#2? Nuh uh<br />
#3? Considering ret pallies still won't pass the 3/3 talent up. still no.<br />
<br />
Maybe if you had a paladin you would see the only reason these help are convenience so we don't have to put seals back up or as often, pretty much they are shaman weapon enchants now.</div></div><hr />

since ure already whining about this i figure ure not that good to think further than: :O BUFF! omg i gota go whine!<br />
<br />
random noob: buuhuuu fights last 1 min (keep in mind that pvp ret's have specced into their seals are imune to dispell and seals last for 2 min, or 1 min longer than fight lasts)<br />
<br />
then the 30 min seals come in.<br />
<br />
random noob: buuuhuuu they got buffed buuhuu it cant be dispelled (it never coud lol) /cry it lasts for 30 min (he just cried battles last 1 min)<br />
<br />
in my opinion i dont see the problem. as ret's will most likely stil specc stoicism and sanctefied seals.<br />
so the only buff is that pve palas dont need to refresh alot and it makes the pve ret specc more viable for BG's if u dont want to respecc for that.</div></div><hr />

the one thing I care about is the divine plea BUFF.<br />
yes it's a buff for PvP..<br />
<br />
i mean, GOOD paladins used divine plea once their team mate is at ~80-100% anyway.And then they los'ed everyone that can dispel it.<br />
<br />
now they dont even have to LoS...<br />
burst dmg will be towned down, the 50% healing reduction wont hurt that much(in PvP, ofc), and if the Paladins really really need to heal themself/their partner, they just click divibe plea off....</div></div><hr />

tell me one GOOD reason why should rogues wait for pve buffs till 3.1? even eleshaman got them in 3.0.8<br />
also bringing those buffs now will provide more real testing, especially since current pve content is easy at could be more balanced whn 3.1 launches<br />

and no, i dont have a rogue for raiding or pvping, my rogue is still sitting at 70 lev, basically rogues are shafted and even tho i like them being nerfed in pvp, i dont like rotating 3 rogues for 1 rogue spot just because their dps isnt as good as it should be. i wouldnt bring any rogue, but since we dont have any feral druid, we would waste quite abit of leather drops, so... please, some pve rogue buffz, now!<br />

Mutilate will now do 120% instead of 150% on poisoned targets. That's a decrease of mutilate damage by 20%. Damage from mutilate itself only makes up 20% of the damage of a rogue.<br />
So basically the &quot;nerf&quot; is about 4% of total-damage done.<br />

On the other hand HfB will now give 15% damage increase, up from 9%, that alone is a ~5,5% buff, and then you also get the buff from SnD which also benefits Mutilate Rogues ofcourse.<br />

<br />
for me atleast, there is still no justification for this nerf anyhow<br />
since if they want to balance around UR, they might also nerf down other glyphs since its also affected by UR then.<br />
also i dont think that a 2% crit chance (meele-wise) will be on par with 3% less proc chance.</div></div><hr />

do you have EJ link, please? not that i dont trust them, but i can pull random numbers out of my ass, too, if i wanted to, still, even with 300 dps increase, which i doubt it will be, rogues were alot more behind other dps classes than that.<br />
<br />
if muti nerf will be 5% loss, HfB 6% buff, its 1% gain, since white attacks are about 30-35% dps, 130%&gt;140% speed is only 7,7% increase of white dmg, its about 2,7% overall increased dps, add 1% from HfB/muti and you have 4% dps gain in pve, tops, thats hardly significant or proclaimed 300dps and hardly number, which will make rogues competitive<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because the UR changes are also giving us a self buff of 2% melee crit, and they have nerfed the WF glyph to compensate for it.<br />
<br />
<br />
well, i also dont see ANY connection between WF glyph and UR, UR change is comming in 3.1, WF glyph in 3.0.9, also there are toher ways to balance thing than with glyphs, but its not like 2% melee crit will make big difference anyway, since enhas has quite alot of dmg in magic.</div></div><hr />

<br />
60% mind numbing is now changed to 30%.. thats nerfed by HALF. What about slightly tweaking it down to maybe 40-45% ? I mean it cant have been OP by a full 30% ffs. Also, thank god they change gotta go to a joke since i would probably not have got it done prenerf with this form of poison.<br />

As far as other class changes go it seems like blizzard just dont realise how big 25% increase/decreases are. Do they just pull numbers out their ass? Seems like it<br />

<br />
How come? Because our damage is increased in PvE we should cut wrists and bleed to death? The mutilate % damage modifier affects certainly the burst damage delivered by it, but PvE is not really about burst damage. The changes to HfB and SnD will overall boil out to be way more significant. The only concern, if any, is that combat tree is slowly starting to look like the topdog once more. Hopefully they can and will maintain also in the future that the more complex game style will be rewarded with more DPS. For PvP mutilate will be nerfed, but if the ocean of tears on various fora is any indicator from its present state, the nerf was most needed. All-in-all, these are the gradual upgrades to rogue DPS that are greatly needed, although there is a risk that with the upcoming changes on haste rating promised, rogues will end up delivering too much damage as faster attacks have a habit of scaling in most great fashion.</div></div><hr />

Other classes are doing way way more damage than mutilate in PvP and none of these changes really affect that. Look at DKs or Mages. In arena you meet targets with high resillience and its already extremely tough to nuke some of them down.<br />
<br />

<br />
Well blizzard wanted warlocks/spriests to e able to live when they get out of cheap shot I guess so they might have a chance to do something against you, and well, they aren't the only ones dying in a global against a muti rogue. And btw, did you just read the rogue part of the post? Because they did nerf arcane mages:<br />
<br />
*Arcane Power now increases damage and mana cost by 10%, <br />
<br />
*Arcane Power and Presence of Mind now share a category cooldown. Arcane Power causes a 15 second cooldown. Presence of Mind, once consumed, causes a 1.5 second cooldown.<br />
<br />
*Slow (Arcane): now increases cast time by 30%, down from 60%.<br />
<br />
However, I really enjoy seing arcane being nerfed as an arcane mage myself atm. Since they said that they would give fire some survival I hope to be able to go for that in arena again. :) Otherwise frost is always an option. Arcane needed some nerfs. But, I think that category cooldown on ap and pom looks a bit stupid, they should have nerfed the dmg instead of making pom some sort of warning sign, looks stupid.</div></div><hr />

I've been expecting and waiting for this burst damage nerf for a while now and tbh I enjoy frost alot more then arcane but it's almost impossible to kill a paladin or a DK as it is.. now when this patch rolls out and my rogue / mage setup gets nerfed into the ground what chance do we have?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I also just noticed that on the mmo talents for mages.. it says PoM and Arcane Power have a 2min cooldowns and that arcane flows reduced the cooldown of both by 2mins, mean? no cooldown on PoM and Arcane Power must be a bug or tooltip mistake?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
to those who don't think rogues are/were &quot;OP&quot; in pvp. your wrong. ive seen priests with 900+resil get killed in the duration of cs/ks. blizzard has said they want to make pvp &quot;less burst then it is&quot;; the change to mutilate certainly helps with that.<br />
<br />
in case you haven't read the other class changes (hi gortz), every cast-time reducing effect is being changed by roughly the same amount. <br />
<br />
however i agree that they need to figure out how to increase dps in pve environments for rogues. i dont think the HfB/Slice and Dice increase will be enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
i play a mage.<br />
<br />
to those who think arcane got &quot;nerfed into the ground&quot; in pve. your wrong. OLD: 30% damage for 18sec (glyphed), 2m cd = 4.5% increased dps. NEW: 10% damage for 18sec (glyphed), 42sec cd =4.28% increased dps. 10% dmg for 15sec (no glyph), 42sec cd = 3.57% increased dps. <br />
<br />
the new AM glyph is a dps increase of approx. 1.5%, assuming 57/3/11 (ty to Maledict for the numbers; im lazy at 6am). <br />
<br />
AB glyph has been 3% for the last 2 weeks, they just haven't changed the tooltip, as some mentioned earlier<br />
<br />
the only thing that has really changed is the need for better/different CD management, and replacing AP glyph for AM glyph.<br />
<br />
the old arcane/Pyro spec is probably gone in pvp. now we know how ret-paladins felt. i expect to see the top-end players respec to something along the lines of 28/0/43.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Divine Plea: The amount healed by your spells is reduced by 50% (up from 20%) but the effect can no longer be dispelled.<br />
<br />
<br />
Huge PVE nerf for pallies, would be logic if they reduce the time of the effect from 15 sec to something like 5-10sec... getting 2.5k FL crits for 15 sec is just waste of mana.</div></div><hr />

Where are the Paladin buffs?<br />
As someone else posted, people would go 3/3 Stoicism and 2/3 Sanctified Seals to play with RNG so that dispels would still attempt to target seals. It's a PvE buff, nothing more.<br />

So is this their sad attempt at buffing sustained Feral PvE DPS? Weren't people complaining about it being too bursty in PvP? Sounds like the Rogues are getting the love and the Ferals/Arms aren't? Fingers crossed that this is just a precursor to the changes in 3.1 ... I've about had it with Feral.<br />
<br />
The issue with Feral is that the rotations are specific, and somewhat complicated... Rake &amp; Mangle, Shred when Mangle is up, keep SR up, keep Rip up. And then try to slip a Ferocious Bite in there? At Rank 8 FB, it's 35 + this 30 energy to use change... over 1/3 of your energy gone.

since if they want to balance around UR, they might also nerf down other glyphs since its also affected by UR then.<br />
also i dont think that a 2% crit chance (meele-wise) will be on par with 3% less proc chance.<br />
<br />
<br />
Enhancement is getting an additional 2% melee crit chance PLUS 3 extra talent points to spend (or at the very least a better place to put 2 talent points than Improved Shields if you weren't specced into UR). Assuming the tree doesn't change around, that should still be a net buff. Windfury is an Enhancement-only glyph -- it wouldn't make sense to nerf glyphs used by Elemental (e.g. FT) if they want only to balance an Enhancement change. Enhancement boss dps has been on the high side any way. I wouldn't be surprised if we saw an actual nerf at some point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if theoretically we end up some 1-2% above patch 3.0.8, we did actually get nerfed. ~8% less damage on heroism and cooldown stacking bring this buffed damage down along with hurting us at fights where instant burst is required. Few examples being the Four Horsemen (nuke Thane asap without swapping) and Malygos (take all benefit off the short while there are 3 stacks of sparks on the ground). I imagine future encounters also including moments like these.<br />
<br />
Our Patchwerk dps might end up raising a tiny, tiny little bit, but our burst management when the situation is calling for it is going down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Death Knight (Skills List / Talent + Glyph Calc.)<br />
* Gargoyle and Unholy Blight have swapped talent positions. Gargoyle’s damage has increased and runic power cost per time has decreased.<br />
* Pestilence – this spell no longer causes damage but just spreads diseases. Blood Boil is intended to be the general area attack, and has been changed to be castable on targets with no diseases on them, but does extra damage if diseases are present.<br />
* Unbreakable Armor now absorbs a flat amount of damage that increases as your armor increases. It no longer boosts armor.<br />
* The Frost tree has been shuffled. Among other things, PvP talents such as Endless Winter are closer to the top of the tree where Blood and Unholy death knights can access them.<br />
* Sudden Doom – this talent now procs a Death Coil rather than requiring an additional button click. It works similarly to shamans’ Lightning Overload.<br />
* Magic Suppression and Blood of the North have been reduced to 3 ranks for the same benefit.<br />
* Blood Gorged now grants armor penetration instead of expertise. <br />
<br />
* Blessing of Kings – this spell is now a base ability trainable by all paladins.<br />
* Exorcism – this spell now causes damage to all types of enemy targets. However, it always critical strikes undead or demon targets. This change should make sure paladin damage doesn’t drop when going from Naxxramas to later tiers of content.<br />
* Shield of the Templar now causes your Avenger’s Shield and Shield of the Righteousness to silence targets for 3 sec. The old damage bonus of this talent has been folded into Holy Shield, Avenger’s Shield, and Shield of the Righteousness.<br />
* Ardent Defender, Improved Hammer of Justice, One-Handed Weapon Specialization and more have had their ranks reduced.<br />
* Guarded by the Light – no longer reduces the mana cost of shield spells, but now has a 50/100% chance to refresh Divine Plea duration.<br />
* Judgements of the Just – now also reduces the cooldown of Hammer of Justice by 10/20 seconds and increases the duration of the Seal of Justice stun effect by 0.5/1 second.<br />

WHATA ??? O_O... what is ur server ? i wanna be there ! in mine every single rogue ARE KITED TIL healer has NO MORE MANA !... -.-!!!(talking about rogue+resto shammie for 2v2)<br />
<br />
actually u don't see the thing even if in the overall pve dmg it is a 300dps boost to rogue, now there is no doubt that combat in 3.1 will be better since they get alot more from haste then mutilate ones do, and combat is pretty much boring compared to mutilate -.-.<br />
<br />
About PvP lets even imagine in an ideal arena that blizzard wants to have... that players are not so bursty... how the hell is a rogue supposed to survive without CDs ?... yes u can claim &quot;duh but it won't be bursty anymore so you would be ok&quot; actually NOT cuz there is a reason all people target rogues in double dps teams and in 3v3... rogues are the SQUISHIEST class in the game atm:<br />
<br />
1- less armor then others(yes u can claim there are clothies but every single one of them has an armor boost and locks even have SL)<br />
<br />
2- ANY player that has leveled a rogue til... lets say level 30 sees that if there is no vanish and evasion and sprint and there is a pull with 3mobs you simply die.... period its a fact rogues die very easily without CDs(you can claim other classes without CDs die too but the last time i checked mages,hunters,etc all had at least one &quot;short time cd&quot; for surviving well guess what rogues don't.<br />
<br />
3- Yes i'm against the dmg decrease of mutilate no i'm not against buffing resilience a bit and yes i am a rogue.<br />
<br />
In PvP if you want rogues to stay &quot;rogueish&quot; they must have damage since their survival is pretty bad after CD's are consumed.<br />

<br />
With this Im in no way claiming that everything Blizzard is doing is correct. From the first day of arena I put forward my opinion that this system with same specs going for PVP ARENA, WORLD PVP, and PVE could never ever work longterm cause things would fast become to complicated to balance, need huge amount of testing time, and in the end it would lead to the REAL content of the game to become stale, with every class hintered by the ability of others, even in diffrent content.<br />
<br />
I think and hope Blizzard will in the end admit that this can not go on much longer. Arena IS a seperate game from the rest of WOW. It should be played out as such with each class having ONE single PVP tree beeing created for the purpose of that gameplay. The sooner that BLizzard does this - the better. And belive me - this will happen. There just is no way that the current system can go on with nerfing weak classes in PVE because they are to strong in PVP and vise versa.</div></div><hr />

so translate that for me. from what i understand u said, it seems your saying rogues need to kill the player before within first 20 seconds of combat. or theyre is no point of being a 'rogue'<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Go hide out in a crack somewhere with the roaches for a bit until the CD's are refreshed again. -Solved! This is simply a small step in the right direction towards balance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
imo you are the one who is retarded... I'm a PvP rogue and ppl whining about rogue burst must play a fucking priest or something. Nerfing rogues is completely wrong. The classes they should nerf is druids, dk's, huntards, ret palas.. ppl whining about rogue burst (and other class burst) don't realise that the rogues use like 80% PvE gear. I always go in PvP gear when I do arena and if I crit it's usually around 2,8-3,1k.. and nerfing mutilate will make my dmg lower and tbh I think my dmg is low now in PvP.. Rogues need a fucking buff. If Blizzard had bin smart they had removed the PvE gear from PvP and there won't be any 20k hp in 3 secs. Nerfing mutilate is retarded.. or.. if they had buffed the resi wich imo also is bullshit atm.. a deadly geared shouldn't lose against a t7 geared, but he does..<br />
first they make sub useless in PvP and now mutilate and I will NEVER go combat in PvP.. suck ballz.. I am soo going to roll a fucking ret pala, they don't need PvP gear in arena.. they just bubble.. Good I have an alt pala at 68</div></div><hr />

<br />
idk if anyone who ISNT a holy pally realises this, but almost all of our high end gear has haste over mp5 now.<br />
<br />
sooo.....this is gonna suck.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's fine... really.<br />
<br />
I can't honestly say I have mana issues at all in most fights, and I certainly don't use DP every CD in the majority of cases (barring sarth 3d, but even that can be accommodated in this &quot;nerf&quot; with good timing and clever use of cancelaura macros).<br />
<br />
Sure, a lot of our gear has haste, and a certain amount of it is always handy, but there are always mp5 pieces/trinkets/rings that can be swapped in if the lack of mana regen really bothers you.<br />
<br />
For the moment I'm going to wait and see how this plays out when we start raiding again after the reset. They haven't included the proposed nerf to Spiritual Attunement that they mentioned in some earlier posts, and hopefully they'll not feel the need for it if this turns out to be enough. <br />
<br />
Whatever happens, I certainly don't expect to encounter any problems at the likes of Naxx/Malygos for the time being at least.</div></div><hr />

I suspect you are wrong, as you said the EU PTR mentions lots of 3.1 so its set for 3.1 to be the next PTR release<br />
<br />
however GC said this today (In regard to HFB change)<br />
<br />
&quot;The damage increase is for 3.09. The mechanic increase is for 3.1. We probably confused some people by announcing the much larger 3.1 changes first.&quot;<br />

I think the windfury glyph nerf isbecause enhance shammies are up there at the top of pve dps right now when shamans are supposed to be a support/enhancing class, who therefor shouldn't really be ahead of pure dps classes that dont contribute much else.

<br />
<br />
It only consumes 30 energy on top of its base cost meaning you can only benefit from 30 energy added to its actually damage (it has base damage then the rest of the damage if from that energy spent). So, it is a nerf to FB, but its not a huge one.</div></div><hr />

It is not really a nerf at all. It just means that holy paladins will need to know when to use Divine Plea now. Its more of a micro management issue than a nerf.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If they do that they will have just returned the spell to how it was originally designed to work before a bunch of whiners complained about it being &quot;overpowered&quot; when it wasn't. Pre-BC it was powerful, but it was never actually overpowered, and in Wrath it is pretty much a necessity.</div></div><hr />

Divine Plea being undispellable changes nothing - between Sacred Shield and all the other random crap buffs up, it was effectively undispellable before even without Stoicism.<br />
<br />
As a bonus, it also nerfs Retribution's Art of War procs and Divine Storm healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
All it means is they will shield, hit divine plea, and then heal themselves to full even with divine plea up. Nerfing a paladins heals even by 50% when they are geared well doesn't really mean crap. I mean half of a 25k crit is still 12.5k every 2 seconds (with haste).</div></div><hr />

Mediocre pet buffs, seems to me like Blizz took a mile from BM and now are giving back an inch.<br />
<br />
<br />
Beast Mastery is PET BASED dps. They are going to buff pets to allow the tree to be competitive. They are buffing pets even more in 3.1. If you don't like your pet doing most of your damage then spec marksman or survival (both will be about equal after 3.1).<br />
<br />
It is true, they nerfed a class that could do 5000+ dps in good blues, but thats not really a problem seeing now they can still do 4000+ dps in good gear. However, some of the other insane dps classes could use a balance.</div></div><hr />

Because one is on a 6 minute timer and the other one is on a 5 (3) minute timer. If you want to put divine plea on a 6 minute timer then you can start complaining about the healing reduction.</div></div><hr />

They promised that we'd be able to test the change to Divine Plea before it went live! :(<br />

they once again managed to kill Mutilate specs for pve. <br />
<br />
<br />
i dont see were it ups Mutilate specs.. yes we get 6% bonus dmg on HfB but we lose effective 30% mutilate dmg.... so basicly we lose dmg in pve.<br />
<br />
the SnD change in nice. but aint gonna work much difference to muti specs as we're already fast weaponised<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like its time for mutilate to adjust in a respec to combat. Adapt or die off, the burst damage done in pvp had to go. Next they need to work on burst damage to all other classes then purge this game of the stupidity that is mortal strike.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It is not that its trashy it is that it is only balanced for pvp (with the exception of a few items) because resilience now costs a lot more than it did in TBC. They are also keeping pvp gear and pve gear pretty equal. In TBC the start pvp gear was just as trashy, but as they kept adding seasons they kept improving that gear and it didn't take long until the arena gear was better than 95% of the raid gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Huge PVE nerf for pallies, would be logic if they reduce the time of the effect from 15 sec to something like 5-10sec... getting 2.5k FL crits for 15 sec is just waste of mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe PvE paladins will need to learn to actually play their class now? I mean, seriously, if you had to use DP and heal at the same time then you failed. You use it when you know there isn't a lot of damage coming in. At the very most this change will make it so the main tank actually needs two healers instead of just one paladin.</div></div><hr />

Stupid imo.... Blizzard is just making the seal buffs less unique every time. Soon it will just end up as a shaman weapon enchant and duration increased to 1 hour. <br />
/Facepalm<br />

Weren't people complaining about it being too bursty in PvP? Sounds like the Rogues are getting the love and the Ferals/Arms aren't? Fingers crossed that this is just a precursor to the changes in 3.1 ... I've about had it with Feral.<br />
<br />
<br />
The sad part is that you play a feral druid and think this is a pve buff instead of a pvp nerf. You need to learn how your abilities work.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The issue with Feral is that the rotations are specific, and somewhat complicated... Rake &amp; Mangle, Shred when Mangle is up, keep SR up, keep Rip up. And then try to slip a Ferocious Bite in there? At Rank 8 FB, it's 35 + this 30 energy to use change... over 1/3 of your energy gone. Is this supposed to be a replacement for using Rip exclusively?<br />
<br />
<br />
FB doesn't belong in any pve rotation unless the mob is about to die and you want to get that last bit of burst in. I will agree that the rotations are complex. So are the rotations for Moonkin (watch your buffs because as soon as eclipse is up you have to suddenly switch to starfire). I much perfer something simple like a shadow priest where as long as your dots are up and your mb/death are always on cool down you are golden.</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure about wether or not someone else has said this (not reading through 12 pages of tears and glee :)) but its not really a nerf? 10% haste is a fuckload on something that we always get, this would give us extra energy extra poison procs.

True pve players give a crap less about pvp. These nerfs are coming because your fellow arena players wanted them to happen, so blame them. Like I have said, if all you want to do is pvp constantly then go play a game like WAR where pvp is much more of the game then re-rolling whatever class is oped at the moment to mow down newbs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Very few pieces of Arena gear were better than the equivalent raid gear. <br />
The issue was attainability - S2, which was T5 equivalent, could be had by anybody at a time when most guilds were still farming Karazhan for gear rather than badges. S3 was pretty much the same when it came out.<br />
<br />
So yes, if you were in a badly progressed guild, then pvp pieces 1-2 tiers above the pve gear you could actually earn were indeed better than &quot;95%&quot; of those pieces. Much the same way that pve gear 1-2 tiers above your progression is better than &quot;95%&quot; of those pieces.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fye-San</div><div class="date">2009-02-10, 03:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think the windfury glyph nerf isbecause enhance shammies are up there at the top of pve dps right now when shamans are supposed to be a support/enhancing class, who therefor shouldn't really be ahead of pure dps classes that dont contribute much else. See also rogue QQ. I have thoroughly enjoyed watching them squirm since wotlk released. <br />
<br />
<br />
This is extremely erroneous thinking; Don't contribute much? Lets see, strength of earth (which overwrites a dk's HoW), windfury if you don't have a frost dk, unleashed rage if you don't have a blood dk/mm hunter, heroism, 1% hit to aura if you're draenei, poison cleansing totem, disease cleansing totem... The wf nerf isn't at all related to the &quot;buff&quot; of unleashed rage, given that blood dks and mm hunters get the exact same thing for fewer talent points and with a great additive effect, 2% melee crit is nice but it's not that great compared to 2% strength.<br />
<br />
Enhancement is NOT ahead of pure dps classes (with the possible exceptions of warlocks and rogues who both do need some looking at), you'll have fury warriors and frostfire mages leading the pack, shaman nowhere near their dps level. The reason most of us are angry at this change is because it completely derails the paradigm of enhancement and effectively kills off windfury at being a viable weapon imbue. Kid you not, the BiS mainhand with these changes will be Torch of Holy Fire, bis still being webbed death; both imbued with flametongue. How is that in any way a desirable route to take, effectively putting us back into the beta stage as far as weapon choices go.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Significa</div><div class="date">2009-02-10, 04:30 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe it's good now that seals cannot be dispelled (Reason being, paladins cannot do much without an active seal) but, increasing the duration to 30minutes…is just…well wrong. Honestly, I’m sure many paladins do not wish to be an auto-attack class (Yeah, I’ll just use the BoM glyph + Command and autoattack for 30minutes). I did not have a problem with the 2 minutes earlier but I suppose 5 minutes would not have been bad (Or perhaps I’m thinking, they could incorporate the duration of the seals into Sanctified Seals, so it actually pertains to seals. Like a extra minute per talent point).<br />
<br />
Now, Divine Plea on the other hand, is heavily uncalled for. Yes, in the current situation it is nearly impossible to run out of mana but whoever, that may not be the case for Ulduar. Also, Divine Plea makes around 30% of my mana regeneration at the moment, second to Illumination. As of now, with JotP and my haste, I can cast about 9 – 10 Holy lights around 10k~ each (Assuming it’s not a critical heal) in the 15 seconds of Divine plea. That’s about 50,000 health less I’m healing (That’s like 5,700~ mana which is how much one Divine Plea restores). Now if you’re going to say “Use Divine Plea when you aren’t casting”, I don’t think there’s a period of time a healer should just be standing there doing nothing during a raid. Perhaps reduce the mana regenerated or duration instead of making it a 50% reduction which in my opinion, is overdoing it.</div></div><hr />

Wtb Mutilate Glyphs already, god damn Blizzard.<br />

Anyways, the SnD/HfB changes will increase our white/special damage overall, even though white damage isn't our thing, specials are. Also, more haste = more FA procs = more energy = more chances to Mutilate, could possibly reverse the Mutilate nerf.<br />

All classes have those sorts of concerns, simply to different degrees and in different areas. That's what keeps them interesting.<br />
<br />
You should worry more about keeping your abilities up than overstacking combo points - yes, ultimately you're losing 'opportunities', but the main throttle on rogue dps is energy gain.<br />
HfB is changing to have no stacks at all in 3.1, so it will be much cheaper to restore when lost on a melee unfriendly boss fight (are there any melee friendly boss fights?)<br />

* Hunger for Blood (Assassination): Now increases damage 5% per stack, (up from 3%.)**<br />
* Mind Numbing Poison now reduces cast time by 30%, down from 60%.<br />
* Mutilate damage will now do 20% increased damage against poisoned targets, down from 50%.<br />
* Slice and Dice: This ability now increases melee attack speed by 40%, up from 30%.**<br />
<br />
Those hunger for blood and slice and dice nerfs definitely nerf pve harcore!<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all, i hope this is fake news. Theres no mention of it anywhere by blizzard and those links in OP dont say anything related to this.<br />
<br />
They shouldn't have touched mutilate though. If they wanted to change burst they should modify overkill or Vigor cuz right now we're sitting with 130 energy with 10 energy reduction on abilities for 6 sec after breaking stealth. This is where the burst is coming from. The change just ruins our sustained damage on fights where we arent starting from stealth and it really annoys me blizzard have no idea what they're doing.</div></div><hr />

These nerfs are coming because your fellow arena players wanted them to happen, so blame them. Like I have said, if all you want to do is pvp constantly then go play a game like WAR where pvp is much more of the game then re-rolling whatever class is oped at the moment to mow down newbs.<br />
<br />
<br />
I play pve as well, but i notice a huge difference between the extremists in pve and pvp. although pvp has a much higher competitional environment, the players that are doing it are much better sports. While a pve'er only wants to top dmg to show off, and need on all epics they can need on, even on pvp items so they can have &quot;fun&quot; in a bg rather then a true PVP player. Im glad with the nerfs to rogue, and the buffs to BM, and ur right it happends because &quot;my&quot; fellow arena players wanted them to happen.<br />
<br />
I do not blame them, i cheer at them, and i cheer at blizzard for listening (even though they are slow). Btw, ive been at servers 1st kills since SSC, so im a pve'er as well.<br />
<br />
Besides, ive only played 1 class for 3 years.. a hunter, and ive stuck with it trough nerfs and nerfs. So ur comment is kinda out of place here.</div></div><hr />

But while top mages were already playing frost stacking high haste rating (look at best european rpms) so they won't be hit so hard by the arcane nerf, rogues rely to much on assassination talents like deadly brew at the moment (Crippling poison without deadly brew is the worst snare in the game unless you're playing against a priest team). We got two 51points talents (hunger for blood and killing spree) completely usless in pvp. Shadowdance could be nice (even if I think it is a bit too situational and counterable and the ambush / silence nerfs almost killed the offensive utility of this talent) if only they didnt nerf shadowstep and hemo / backstab damage wasnt so low compared to the damage any other class can deal (including healers). I really hope to see some nerfs to all other op damage dealers, like dks and hunters, a really BIG nerf to holy paladins which at the moment requires almost 0 skill while playing fotm and some fixes to the subtlety tree so that we can at least choose to change our spec.</div></div><hr />

Its funny people keep Q.Q, if you dont like it leave, yes this is my first message here specialy acc made for people whining, you try keep over 10 MILJION people happy, there making it as fair as they can. if a rogue Q.Q that he cant kill a mage its not called OP its how you play your class. and if you return with a comment they get payed for it over millions per month so they have to do a job, ever heard of employee bills, Power etc.<br />
The servers are up 24H a day. exept wednesday. and yes there are some minor bugs but its a game not a life.<br />
if you whine at people's work that prolly means you cant make it and your jalous.<br />

Exactly if you think further then your tiny brain, you know that as i said there are over 10 milion people to please, Not everybody has the time to raid from 19:00 till 23:00 or even longer. Thats why they created pvp, if you dont like it play a game where you cant pvp only pve.</div></div><hr />

Yet a warriors shout is still 2 minutes and requires 2 talent points and a glyph to make it 4 minutes.<br />
<br />
3.1 comes along and blessing of kings becomes baseline<br />
Yet a warrior still has to spend 7 talent points for a inferior ability<br />
<br />
A paladin pays 2 talent points to improve the effects of blessing of might by 25% while a warrior still pays 5 points for a 25% increase in shouts.<br />
<br />
Yet the Dk still wins with horn of winter not only do they gain 130 strength/agi (best of all 3 buffs) it also cost them no resources but instead gives them resources for free.<br />
<br />
Imo battle/commanding shout should be combined into 1 shout with a 5 minute duration 30 second cooldown and grant 10 rage (costs no rage)<br />
commanding presence should be changed into a 2 imitation of improved blessing of might<br />
The battle shout glyph should increase the rage given by using a shout by 50%</div></div><hr />

look at all the top teams with a holy pala, they need to be toned down, and to all the pve carebears, i very much doubt that someone cant cover your healing for 15 seconds for you to regain 25% of your manabar (sick) if things start to look grim.. but should blizzard ignore PVP nerfs just cause all the pve QQ:ing ?<br />

Crappy comparison.. if u bought an expensive car, and it would stop working, u would get pissed, and complain to the company that sold them, or made them. If u bought a crappy 2nd hand car and it broke down.. u would be more likely be thinking &quot;meh, was bound to happen some day&quot;. Ofc ull think of a solution for the moment, but on long term, u would either get ur car fixed or buy a new one.<br />
<br />
Blizzard made a game, it was fun and good. Then in the years it has become crappy and breaks down frequently. U have the right to complain to Blizzard and demand fixes for the product u pay for on a monthly basis. Its a product we all invest our money in to see improvement, and thus we deserve to be heared.<br />
<br />
They make tons of money, why cant they hire good programmers to do the job right straight away? Why cant they buy more servers for faster que's, lagless instances and raids? Why cant they release patches without them having tons of different bugs that werent there before, and all of a sudden broke down? I honestly dont know..<br />
<br />
Democracy is a good thing, and its good Blizz heard our complaints about Rogues in PVP, and i can only hope the nerfbat works just as well on Paladins in 3.1<br />
Not all players have more then 1 car (more then 1 char) I for example have only 1 for 3 years, and cba to start playing another. Ive excepted the nerfs they did to hunter, but i can complain whenever i feel like its needed. Because its my product, i paid for it, thus deserve a good product for the money and time i put into it.</div></div><hr />

Well I get bored of the same class if I play it every day, so Changing it up is nice, and I don't think the nerf bat will be hitting anything but holy Paladin, Ret paladin wont see a nerf cause blizzard can't nerf them as is. If blizz wanted to do anything to Ret they have to give paladin more latent dmg abilities and otherwise. The only reason they are so bursty is because they only have 3 damaging melee attacks, and upcoming exorcism change. So you won't see a ret nerf until they do an overhaul. as for the product we pay for, I have taken shits worth more than 15$, and its only a month, that's seriously a joke, a bum off the street could scrounge up 15$ in less than a day. If blizz was charging 60$ a month, then I would understand your complaint about product satisfaction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I was also referring to Holy Paladins. I think rets are fine atm. You seems to forget that 6 million ppl are paying 15$ a month. Sit and think about the amount of money they gather every month. Blizzard should hire some better programmers, gametesters, etc etc to improve the game. Never have i played a game that was this buggy, and recieved this amount of complaining. I complained about the big BM nerf, but am happy with this patch, and maybe patch 3.1. Its in Blizzards best interest to keep product satisfaction, or ppl will just scout for something better.<br />
<br />
I myself used to be a programmer, and now im a gamedesigner. Blizzard is lucky this game makes ppl addicted to it, or it would have died long ago :)<br />

Honestly, I’m sure many paladins do not wish to be an auto-attack class (Yeah, I’ll just use the BoM glyph + Command and autoattack for 30minutes). I did not have a problem with the 2 minutes earlier but I suppose 5 minutes would not have been bad (Or perhaps I’m thinking, they could incorporate the duration of the seals into Sanctified Seals, so it actually pertains to seals. Like a extra minute per talent point).<br />
<br />
<br />
Removing 2 minute seals will make the paladin an auto attack class? Have you ever played a paladin above level 40. Currently, paladins at 80 are spamming consecration, hammer of the righteous, holy shield, shield of the righteous, judgment and exorcism/holy wrath if they are protection. Retribution spams crusader strike, divine storm and judgment. Holy damage will be spamming holy shock, shield of the righteous and judgment. What part of that makes them an auto attack class exactly? Please learn what you are discussing before typing anything about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, Divine Plea on the other hand, is heavily uncalled for...<br />
<br />
<br />
Given replenishment while you are stacking intellect and using mp5/crit gear you can easily spam heals and never worry about mana issues as it is. DP isn't necessary in the majority of fights. You claim Uludar will be harder because Blizzard claims it will be harder, but as I will say for the 100000000x since I started playing MMOs, don't start talking about how it will be impossible to do something in future content until you actually play that content.</div></div><hr />

That includes 3.0.1. When they released 3.0.1 they didn't mention there would be a patch until way after noon eastern.

<br />
I am just glad Darkfall is around the corner with crappy graphics and all.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes because a rogue and mage bursting through anything that isn't able to stack stam through the roof and stack resilience just as high is &quot;balance&quot;. You are so pathetic if you think so. If your rogue/mage can no longer kill something in an opening combo then that is balance. Other classes are having issues killing things in opening combos. PvP fights aren't supposed to last less than 20 seconds. They still need to address more of the burst in other classes, but this patch nerfs mage burst, feral burst, and rogue burst already. 3.1 has even more nerfs to feral burst and warrior burst. Face it, after 3.1 classes aren't going to be able to destroy casters in less than 20 seconds. Deal with it or please quit. Enjoy Darkfall or whatever. Do you have any idea how many games are put into concept and never see the light of the gaming world? Hell, Mythic had to sell its soul to EA just to get WAR out.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No they created PvP so that people could enjoy facing each other in combat like was done in the Warcraft games. Then they slowly dwindled it down into Arenacraft after people bitched enough about how it was created. You don't like nerfs, but the majority of pvp in this game has been nerfed into stupidity.</div></div><hr />

Yet a warriors shout is still 2 minutes and requires 2 talent points and a glyph to make it 4 minutes...<br />
<br />
<br />
As a protection paladin I totally believe that warrior shouts should be made 30 minutes and they should rework the talents so that they are equal. I kind of like equality among the classes. Short of that, if they are going to be short duration buffs then let battle should restore 10 rage and commanding shout restore 10% of health and put them on 2 minute cool downs.</div></div><hr />

Maybe it's not nerf on paper but in practice... we'll see<br />
<br />
<br />
All I play is PvE and I still don't give a damn about it. I play because I like the social aspect and raiding can be fun sometimes. That doesn't mean I actually care about PvE. Doing new things can be fun, but I don't worry about progression, and I never do fights where I don't need the gear. I'm one of those PvE loot whores that people have been complaining about. I haven't bothered with Malygos because our main tank does it and I don't need anything from it (I could care less about a title). I don't mind doing OS with drakes up although all it gives is dps gear for 2 and a drake/title that I could care less about for 3.</div></div><hr />

This will hit the 5 man palas alot harder - making their life almost impossible. Maybe thats intented. <br />
<br />
Secondly. The change to seals was needed. The paladin class is becoming the biggest micromanagment class out there atm. All specs have huge amount of instants that they need to focus on to be able to play the class properly. WOLK brought no real base spells to the class - only buffers that improve previous spells. <br />
<br />
WOW can never be considered to be fair game when it has to please both PVE and PVP with the same basic stats. Thats why this current system is so bad cause in many cases it will have to destroy what is unique about the class in one part to balance the other. <br />
<br />
Best thing Blizzard could do come next expansion is to seperate the PVP and PVE specs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With the Divine Plea nerf, and when the arena metagame is less burst oriented, Holy Paladins numbers will skydrop.<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason that holy paladins are on top in 2v2 imo is because they can constantly spam heals using beacon of light on two people to the point that it is hard to kill either member of the team. On top of that they can still do decent damage (from a pvp standpoint) at the same time. To top that off they have a ton of survivability tricks if specced right including the ability to just remove 60% of all damage from their partner while making themselves immune to damage for 15+ seconds. During that time they can still heal. Holy paladins are on top because they are the most powerful of the healers when it comes to actual survival now, and they are going to stay there after this patch. As far as the DP nerf, please tell me the last time a well geared paladin with replenishment had mana issues even without DP.</div></div><hr />

DO you rly think it's fair to nerf a class that don't need it at all? If they buff resi then the PvE burst wouldn't exist and ppl would start using PvP gear.<br />
<br />
<br />
Keep telling yourself that. Blizzard gave up on that stupidity finally. Resilience will never do enough to overcome burst in this game. This game simply isn't set up to be a defensive game in PvP. It is all about offense, so the nerfs have to come from offense too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It just makes them have to think when they are forming a 5 man group. They will need to have replenishment and a mage (for arcane intellect) in their 5 man pve groups now. It is next to impossible to run out of mana with replenishment up when I heal currently with a 19k mana pool and I'm healing as a protection spec on the fights I heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They capped the top end for Ferocious Bite because it was too much straight burst damage. It also is a PvE nerf/buff however you want to see it. Meaning all of your energy when you use it won't be drained if you use it on a boss. So if you had 100 energy and used it, you would do full damage with the max 30 extra energy and still be left with 35 left, which you can use for another skill.<br />
<br />
&quot;Converts each extra point of energy into [ 0.244% of AP + 9.4 ] additional damage.&quot; so the max you could do is 30*.244% of AP + 9.4 extra damage (which is added on to the base amount you get for using it).</div></div><hr />

For Mage / rogue teams in arena who QQ- <br />
<br />
You knew this time would come. Admit that your burst is too much right now. Wait, don't admit it, it doesn't matter. 95% of the players have noticed it and it's changing, regardless of what you say.<br />
<br />
For all of you who think Ret paladins need a nerf in PvP - <br />
Why? There aren't many rets in the 2k+. At least not on my battlegroup.<br />
<br />
Currently, at least for my battlegroup, once I got passed 1900. Every team I fa ced had one of these three classes : Mage, rogue, priest. Not cool to 70% of the rest of the players. Rogues and mages are getting much needed burst nerfs so other classes have a fighting chance.</div></div><hr />

<br />
JotP should just give us 15% spell haste, hell I'd be happy with 10% if it meant I could stop judging in raids.<br />
<br />
<br />
I hate pallies that don't judge. JoW/JoL/etc on bosses is EXTREMELY powerful for ANY mana based class in a raid, put it all together and having 3 pallies in a raid vs. having 1 is a world of difference.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladins don't even use Beacon of Light in 2v2, they use 49/0/22.<br />
<br />
The reason Holy Paladins are the best healers in S5, is because of the current meta game, burst oriented, just like tbc S1. Paladins have the best tools in the game to counter burst. Arena burst is going to be replaced by sustained damage just like S2/S3/S4, paladins representation will go down.<br />
<br />
<br />
Season 6 is not going to be Season 2 in terms of Paladin representation. They have received MASSIVE improvements since Season 4. Not the least of which being excellent instant heals between Holy Shock, Sacred Shield, and instant FoL procs (or 1 second Holy Lights). Don't forget a new and improved Sacrifice, Freedom that removes stuns, 40 yard judgments, and HUGE mana efficiency; as well as the old staples of Bubble, BoP, and HoJ (and new, improved anti-silence talents).<br />
<br />
Any negatives from this Divine Plea nerf will be countered by buffs from cast speed slowing effects being only 25-30%.<br />
<br />
If you expect Paladins to nosedive to last place in S6, think again.</div></div><hr />

Like I said - most good palas will be fine. Problem is that when ppl are doing 5 mans and puging - then you dont know beforehand if the person is good or bad player. And no... Still doing 5 man content does not make ppl bad players. But the trend in WOTLK has been to avoid holy palas when puging 5 mans and this will just increase that trend. <br />
<br />
There are plenty of bad players playing the other healing specs that are able to progress in the game. Those classes have been given tools to manage all situations. Holy palas dont have the tools at same degree and Blizzard is not doing anything to correct it. Well.. actually they did it when they increased BOL to 20 yard radious - only to change it back cause RAIDING ppl where whining their arse off cause of it. That change had nothing to do with raiding tho. It had to do with the very basic grouping wich the entire game is build upon in PVE. And there is one healing class that is still considered by the entire WOW comunity to not have the tools to be able to do that to the same degree as the other healers. But again - maybe thats intented by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have to agree with you on this one. Most players that havn't played paladins since start of TBC dont realise how huge swings have been going on for the spec. There was the day when downranking WAS INTENDED by Blizzard and the entire holy paladin spec was build around that. Then came season 2 of Arena with huge changes that hurt ret palas alot more than holy palas (something that Blizzard seems to have learned from now). Then came more changes to PVE raiding way of playing - including changing stats and set bonuses and in the end they even SKIPPED creating ANY healing plate gear for the raiding content. <br />
<br />
What we can be 100% sure of that Paladins are the class that BLizzard has always had ZERO problem about throwing around anyway they like. Thats probably the main reason alot of paladins quit now cause 90% of the time - the changes are not thought out at all. Just random fast changes while most other classes are given time to balance it out over time. <br />
<br />
Holy paladins are they only spec ingame atm where Blizzard is not sharing the basic idea of &quot;bring the player - not the spec&quot; in PVE content. EXACTLY because of that the spec now needs a nerf to ANOTHER part of the game - namely PVP cause a class that ONLY has single healing spells simply HAS to be more powerfull in that apartment to even be ABLE to DO the basic PVE content of the game. This simply has to change. ALL HEALING CLASSES NEED TO HAVE THE TOOLS TO MANAGE THE BASICS ! Holy paladins could still be prefered as tank healers even if they had a basic 5 man heal. And that 5 man heal will come. There simply is no way past that. The other option is to nerf the PVE single target heal to balance the PVP healing. Thats something BLizzard is probably thinking about doing and thats their normal way of treating paladins. But holy palas will get their groupheal in the form of a spell at the end. Or... Maybe in 4 years time we will still have a spec using the same old glyph to do basic healing. No.. We all know how stupid that is. And then we all see how stupid Blizzrd really is in THINKING they can leave one single healing spec with ZERO basic ability to counter specific DOMINATING form of dmg in the game.</div></div><hr />

Sometimes I wonder what kind of retards that work at blizzard. Hey why not buff hunters and deathknights for PVP also, thier damage and slowing skills isnt good enough.</div></div><hr />
