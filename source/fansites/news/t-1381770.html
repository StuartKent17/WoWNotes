Battle.Net Beta Profile Images Updated<br />
It seems the Battle.Net Beta Profile (https://us.battle.net/account/management/beta-profile.html) has been updated with new images to reflect the upcoming Diablo 3 and WoW Expansions. The previous art was Mists of Pandaria themed, but now appears to be an image of Thrall, similar to the banners (http://i.imgur.com/Kbxrf5b.jpg) being put up at the convention center.<br />

It won't be official until we see official documents or press releases from either Boub or Blizzard. Simple as. As of right now, there are multiple ways this could go. My best guess is that most of this Warlords of Draenor theory-plotting is complete bullshit, fanmade. This does not rule out the possibility of the title being Warlords of Draenor, but i genuinely think the story will be different from all the recent &quot;leaks&quot; - As well as this, i still believe The Dark Below is just as likely to be the next expansion. Blizzard could easily have put the two up against each other to promote discussion / speculation, which i believe has worked out thus far.</div></div><hr />

I can understand why you would think that. I just dug up the same post for Mists of Pandaria a couple years ago. It has both the same numbers of I guess &quot;Goods and Services.&quot; The MOP Trademark had listed &quot;009&quot; and &quot;041&quot;. (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/july/mistsfopandaria.jpg) The Warlords of Draenor has the exact same numbers. The terminology has changed since then, and I'm assuming still includes the same stuff from before.</div></div><hr />

<br />
True but they've mentioned computer game discs. Surely you can't have a disc without a manual? I initially thought perhaps Blizzard are going to abandon boxed copies of the expansion and offer it online only. Which wouldn't be a huge drama because everyone has to download the expansion anyway regardless of if they buy it or not.. the only thing you really get with the box is a code and the manual. Maybe they're planning to have everyone buy the expansion via the Blizzard store this time. Cuts costs.. makes sure Blizzard gets 100% profit. Wouldn't explain the reference to discs tho. Weird.</div></div><hr />

<br />
its a TWO section statement. In the first part of the statement it just says downloadable electronic game and game discs computer game etc. How is it even logical to be a hearthstone xpac when the game is still in beta? Think before you type lol. The portable part is probably to just have exclusive licensing for phone apps and stuff</div></div><hr />

It is a trademark, it is meant to keep others from using your IP (this includes name, icons etc). If they do not mention portable devices someone else might make an iOS or Android app and call it Warlords of Dreanor or Warlords of Draenor manual, like we see with so many IP's.<br />
<br />
Now keep in mind that we will be seeing this happening more often in the future now that portable devices have become this popular.<br />
<br />
It seems as if people think that the trademark is something that Blizzard needs to file in order to release a product, this of course is not the case, they can release manuals without including it in the trademark.</div></div><hr />

Yes, but my point is they always include specific things in the class 9 trademark depending on what the product is. Go to the US trademark site and look up Burning Crusade, Wrath of the Lich King, Cataclysm, Mists of Pandaria, Wings of Liberty, Heart of the Swarm, Legacy of the Void. They all make mention of game manuals and software being sold as a unit and anything else that's specific to the game such a mousepads.</div></div><hr />

There could be a number of reasons, remember these trademark requests are filed by different employees, each could have a different approach within the specified policy of the company. Also if a trademark is too broad you increase the risk of objections.</div></div><hr />

Also that old image of Thrall being plastered outside the convention center is interesting. Leads me to believe they really want to keep the expansion a secret until the announcement.<br />
<br />
Isn´t there a mobile AH app?<br />

or it could just be them being thorough.<br />

or the more likely situation where it is just a defensive copyright to prevent someone else from throwing up some terrible app with the same name.<br />

<br />
I think the thing that's putting most people off it is the leak that claims we'll be going back in time, hence Warlords of 'Draenor' and not 'Outland'. If we do go back in time, there'll be no return of Illidan, no Alleria or Turalyon, no revamped Outland, no Argus, no Xoroth, no revenge of the Burning Legion, just the old Orc clans, the Draenei, and one hell of a historical mess and retcons.<br />
<br />
I'm still holding out hope for The Dark Below, because I like the Naga and Old Gods a lot and I want to see both Nazjatar and Ny'Alotha more than anything. But, I'm down for a return of the Legion. It'd be awesome adventures beyond our world again, and possibly playable Ogres or Arrakoa or even Ethereals.<br />
What I don't wait is what the leaks and speculation hints Warlords of Draenor will be, which would involve a whole expansion of time-travel and a massive headache for anyone following the storyline.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To be fair, the idea of travelling back to pre-Legion Draenor brings up a lot of problems. For example (based off the time-travel speculation and supposed leaks):<br />
-Wouldn't some people like Velen who lived through those events recognise us back in the present?<br />
-How will the orcs forget about creatures such as the player Goblins, Pandaren, Worgen, Trolls, Gnomes, etc? Since they obviously aren't familiar with them when they first saw them in older games, what causes them all to forget us at the end of the xpac?<br />
-Are we in disguise like in Caverns of Time? If so, I'm sure it'd annoy a lot of players to be stuck in say Orc or Draenei or some other form for the expansion.<br />
-It feels a bit strange and somewhat underwhelming to be fighting Garrosh and Deathwing again, after they already had an expansion each building them up as the main villain for their story. To then go back and fight them again, as downgraded versions (by which I mean lesser story elements than 'final boss') feels a bit sucky.<br />
-Ultimately, we already know what's going to happen. For our timeline to continue existing, we'd have to either engineer the events that caused the Orcs downfall into fel-corruption, or stop others from preventing it. In either case, we already know how it all works out.<br />
<br />
Time-travel, at least in my opinion, works best in smaller doses. Such as the Caverns of Time instances. It's a lot easier to work our appearances (mostly disguised) into single events like ensuring Thrall escapes Durnholde Keep, or keeping Arthas on the path we already know he took in our timeline. A whole expansion based off that concept could cause massive plot holes, inconsistencies and overall be a massive headache to follow.</div></div><hr />

Mists of Pandaria sounded very weird - it's arguably the best expansion to date (personal opinions ofc). If they take the positives from this expansion we have and implement it in this one Im really looking forward to it.<br />
<br />
Yes time travel is tricky and can be a mind fcuk for people but hey they might pull it off better than you think, they may do things you never thought about and certainly the bad people may not be the people you were expecting.<br />

Why go back in time? Whats done is done. Wont we change it all if we go back? Will all the stuff that happend between classic-MoP just be for no reason? Or do we need to go back in time and make sure it stays like that?<br />
<br />
I dont know, it sounds like total chaos. Blizzard is making sure more people wont get into the lore if this is time travel. Talk about making a mess.<br />
<br />
Also, orcs again? I swear, if I see Thrall or another orc playing a major part in the next xpac I will be greatly disapointed. Come on, give us something else than green jesus.<br />

Yeah.. Time travel is fun for some quests and dungeons. For a entire xpac? No way. Thats going to create a total chaos lorewise.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's my main concern. In a time-travel situation, the best outcome would be that the timeline goes on as normal. Which, when we return to the present, will feel like it didn't matter, since there'd be no difference between our adventure and the whole expansion simply not happening at all. Or the worse scenario, in which we end up altering major events. Which would cause retcons in the storyline, which in turn would be very frustrating that suddenly... say X character is now presented in a completely different light to the previous lore, or Y event now no longer happened. What would the consequences be? How would they be shown in-game? Or would it just be shrugged away and ignored? It's a very thin line, one too thin (in my opinion) to be the basis of an entire expansion. A dungeon or raid? Sure. We've had those before and it was both cool and interesting. But a whole expansion is an entirely different ball game to that. A single event is fine, it can easily be kept within the bounds of the story as we know it to have happened. An entire expansion on that concept would be far too difficult to keep in line with the rest of the story.</div></div><hr />

GC stated it multiple times that a large chunk of people who do LFR do it exclusively and did not even raid prior implementation of LFR. LFR is there just for the casuals to see the new content, besides they're slowly trying to move people away from LFR to Flex raiding which is slightly more challenging. I don't know why you mad though, you have normal and heroic modes to enjoy. <br />

On topic, devoting an entire expansion pack to time traveling would be a huge mistake. <br />
If we go back in time for an entire expansion we surely will have a huge impact on the current lore which means it would make little sense when we go back to the future and it'd require complete world and story revamp. If we do something and in the end they just back track then the entire expansion would be pointless. <br />

Trademark 09 and 41 just like all the other WoW expansions have had. I am guessing the government had to edit a classification to 09 because of windows 8. So the mobile devices really do not mean anything its a WoW expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly, I have to agree, I see these nerfs as totally unnecessary, I run LFR every week, shortly I'll stop as I can't get any upgrades, but, I clear it all each week, first Garrosh kill took 6 wipes, second took 7-8 wipes, can't remember exactly, you know what? I was totally fine about wiping on Garrosh, I love that fight and I want an end boss to be challenging, even in LFR.<br />
<br />
Wiping on Iron Jugg again and again and groups falling apart etc is ridiculous though, and it's all the people, not the game.<br />
<br />
What screwed LFR over is a combination of Flex and Timeless Isle, Timeless Isle is amazing for gearing alts, but for gearing mains to straight 90 to SoO is totally wrong, and I hate, and will always hate, that LFR doesn't audit your character for missing gems and enchants. the armory has an audit on your character profile saying if a person has missing enchants, gems, belt buckle etc, implement that into LFR, fail the audit? You can't queue.<br />
<br />
Back when I was in a top 100 guild, I spent days and days wiping on a single boss, man, 90% of the people would be in for a shock if they raided progression, I know it's not really an argument or the right context, but it's a funny thought.<br />
<br />
On topic, so this basically confirms WoD, however, I do not believe it will be centred around Time Travel, it just doesn't work well, it ruins the feel of the game, I think they will have worked out something different, what exactly? I have no idea, but we will find out soon enough, so I'm ready to not judge it yet, tbh they could release an expansion that I hate the idea of, and I'll still buy it, and play it, and I'll only unsub when either, A: I get bored, B: Friends quit, I'm hoping for minimal time travel BS however.<br />
<br />
Currently I'm loving MoP overall, it's far, far above Cata and I'd say just above Wotlk also.<br />
<br />

no. alternative ANYTHING would be a waste of an expansion.<br />
Time travel is likely to play a part but i VERY much doubt it'll be the focus of the expansion. i think we can expect caverns of time to come back for a dungeon or raid though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But isn't it getting less and less challenging every time you wipe because of the determination buff? It's not that your group was learning and getting better until you beat the encounter (ie, really accomplished something), it's just the game buffed you until it was idiot-proof. So all they're doing is cutting out the first say, 5 wipes with these nerfs.<br />

Also that old image of Thrall being plastered outside the convention center is interesting. Leads me to believe they really want to keep the expansion a secret until the announcement.<br />
<br />
I reckon it's for the mobile/tablet gaming platform and not a WoW expac. Agree with Mischievous - this doesn't follow the 'norm' when it comes to trademarking for the full expacs. - Honest feel? Tower defense type game, Horde vs Alliance PvZ style.<br />

Because it is already in Beta, and maybe they want to introduce the xpack on blizzcon as the next step in heartstone. Yes, it is not released, but to create an xpack for Hearthstone is very easy; and because the Name really fit in the Heartstone-Category.

Just to throw you in a different direction; or we go back with the intent to destroy the horde, we fail, but our meddling throws the horde down a different path which changes the here and now to the horde having a different history altogether, preparing for a new expansion.<br />
<br />
And another one; or we go back and it has to do with the horde, but we're not trying to destroy it. We're there for something else, which really could be anything, so this direction of thought could land you anywhere. Which is my overall point, by the way. :p<br />

In a time-travel situation, the best outcome would be that the timeline goes on as normal. Which, when we return to the present, will feel like it didn't matter, since there'd be no difference between our adventure and the whole expansion simply not happening at all. Or the worse scenario, in which we end up altering major events. Which would cause retcons in the storyline, which in turn would be very frustrating that suddenly... say X character is now presented in a completely different light to the previous lore, or Y event now no longer happened. What would the consequences be? How would they be shown in-game? Or would it just be shrugged away and ignored? It's a very thin line, one too thin (in my opinion) to be the basis of an entire expansion. A dungeon or raid? Sure. We've had those before and it was both cool and interesting. But a whole expansion is an entirely different ball game to that. A single event is fine, it can easily be kept within the bounds of the story as we know it to have happened. An entire expansion on that concept would be far too difficult to keep in line with the rest of the story.<br />
<br />
The forgot the most important scenario. Whatever happened happened. Meaning, no, we don't change anything; however, things worked out the way they did because we were there in the first place. So, it did matter that we were there and what we did mattered because it's the reasons things worked out the way they did in the first place.<br />
<br />
Why doesn't anyone remember us? Well, that's something we'll have to wait to find out. But, I think it's easy to make work.</div></div><hr />

Dark Below has the same class codes. Hell, Corgi's Unleashed had the same class codes. Those don't confirm anything, and the definition under these class codes is so extremely wide. The only difference here is that under the short description given under the class codes, they often relate to the product. Never before they put &quot;mobile devices and tablets&quot; in the description, it also wasn't in the description of the Dark Below. Either they're taking WoW to tablets, or this for something else or it is a cover up. We know the so called screenshot was a fake, due various hints obviously giving it away. I'm personally open to anything, but I just prefer &quot;The Dark Below&quot; being the next expansion than whatever this will be.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm aware, they don't have to pay to apply for a trademark either.<br />
<br />
Looking at the past, Blizzard has been very fond of attempting to cover up their leaks or the trails people pick up, and they also tend to trademark the expansion name a few months in advance of it's announcement.</div></div><hr />

Haven't you read? Class 009 cover a very wide area, the info next to it is merely just summary what will apply to the trademark mainly, but in reality, the trademark covers all areas of the entire 009 Class. Similarly, the trademark would also apply for mousepads, even if they're not mentioned in the summary. It's curious they would now explicitly mention mobile devices such as phones, handheld computers and tablets in the description, rather than the usual schmuck. <br />
<br />
Similarly, my speculation can also mean nothing because as I said, the 009 class covers a lot of bases, and for Pandaland, they explicitly mentioned mousepads (altho, to be fair, MoP mousepads were produced, just like any other expansion name).<br />
Eitherway, this whole trademark blow up has definitely caused hype, but for that purpose really? Creating hype for Blizzcon to trick more people into buying the virtual ticket? Or to catch everyone by surprise when it isn't the expansion? <br />
