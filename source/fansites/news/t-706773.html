If you read this site regularly, and I'm sure that you do, you probably remember the Icecrown Citadel quests introduced with Patch 3.3.3. These quests have finally appeared on live servers and the rewards from this questline are actually Shadowmourne extra rewards. <br />
<br />
It looks like Blizzard decided to add a couple of flavor items to let you attract the attention even more! When you kill the Lich King with a player wearing Shadowmourne in the raid, you will get an additional item - Unsealed Chest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/51316/unsealed-chest/). After bringing the chest to Darion he will open it up and let you bring the items back to their respective owners to get your rewards :<br />
<br />
Reins of the Crimson Deathcharger (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52200/reins-of-the-crimson-deathcharger/) - A brand new mount that looks like the Death Knight's class mount.<br />
Muradin's Favor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52201/muradins-favor/) - A 10-minute Frost Dwarf transformation.<br />
Jaina's Locket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52251/jainas-locket/) - A portal to Dalaran on a 1-hour cooldown, you finally have your own pocket mage!<br />
Tabard of the Lightbringer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52252/tabard-of-the-lightbringer/) - A tabard with a very shiny on-use effect. <br />
Sylvanas' Music Box (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52253/sylvanas-music-box/) - A music box that plays Lament of the Highborne (http://media.worldofwarcraft.com/movies/video_loader/wow_video.htm?vid=LamentoftheHighborne&amp;dir=movies/lament&amp;rating=wow). <br />
<br />
I do realize that a couple of guilds with Shadowmourne already killed the Lich King in Patch 3.3.3, I will assume that the quest was bugged and only recently fixed. Thanks to Heist (http://www.heistguild.com/) from EU-Genjuros for this info! <br />
<br />
Fun fact, even the mount isn't bound on pickup. Time to buy all the Primordial Saronite at the AH.<br />
<br />
Quest - Quest: Personal Property (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24914/personal-property/)<br />
Reward - Unsealed Chest (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/51316/unsealed-chest/)<br />
Description<br />
Bring the Sealed Chest to Highlord Darion Mograine in Icecrown Citadel.<br />
<br />
You can detect no hinges or openings on this box. Were it not for the shifting of items inside, it could easily be mistaken for solid metal. If anyone could know the method of its opening, it would be Highlord Mograine.<br />
<br />
Presumably, opening the box will contain five items, which the player will then return to their respective owners:<br />

Reward - Jaina's Locket (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52251/jainas-locket/)<br />
Description<br />
What's this? He... he kept it.. all this time he kept it! &lt;Cries&gt; I knew! &lt;Cries&gt; I sensed a part of him still alive... trapped... struggling. Oh Arthas! Perhaps he might someday remember from what he once was... By the Light may he at last find rest, free from the icy grip of that terrible blade!<br />
<br />
Quest - Muradin's Lament (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24917/muradins-lament/)<br />
Reward - Muradin's Favor (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52201/muradins-favor/) - Frostborn Illusion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/73320/frostborn-illusion/) - Screenshot (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/february/frostbornillusion.jpg)<br />
Description<br />
Oh lad, how I missed those endless days in Lordaeron, sharpening your skill with this dull blade. Forging you into a weapon meant to withstand the demands of a great destiny. Heh… You sure put them skills to use, didn't you lad? If only I'd been able to stop you that day, how different things migha' been. If only I'da never discovered that accursed blade. Farewell, Arthas, my brother.<br />
<br />
Quest - Sylvanas' Vengeance (http://db.mmo-champion.com/q/24918/sylvanas-vengeance/)<br />
Reward - Sylvanas' Music Box (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52253/sylvanas-music-box/)<br />
Description<br />
So, it is done. I had not dared to trust my senses. Too many times has the Lich King made me to be a fool. Finally, he has been made to pay for the atrocities he imposed upon my people. May Azeroth never fail to remember the horrible price we paid for our weakness, for our pride. But what now, Hero? What of those freed from his grasp but still shackled to their mortal coils? Leave me. I have much to ponder.<br />

Reward - Tabard of the Lightbringer (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/52252/tabard-of-the-lightbringer/)<br />
Description<br />
Arthas... Alas, hero of Azeroth. You give me a greater gift than you know. Long have I struggled to forgive the prince for his terrible transgressions. My soul has been wracked with unbearable anxiety, dark thoughts, distancing me from the light. I recall clearly... the gleam of pride in his eye as he stood before me, eager to defeat the enemies of the light... eager to defend his people, no matter the cost. It is this memory of Arthas that I choose to keep in my heart. I shall always be in your debt, friend. Thank you.<br />

Description<br />
Alexandros: Darion, my son. At last I am able to lay my eyes upon you again. The Lich King tormented me without end, Darion. Endlessly he sought to break my will, to force me to serve him, to bind me to his blade. Finally, when events demanded his full attention, he left me. The one memory I clung to Darion, the one thought that kept me from giving in, it was your sacrifice, my son. That again saved me from eternal peril.<br />
<br />
Darion: Father, father, I… I feared for your sanity, father, for you, I would give my life a thousand times.<br />

Mana regen in Cataclysm (Bye Bye 5-Second rule)<br />
Two changes we're considering are combining all food and drink into food+drink and getting rid of the five-second rule in exchange for an out of combat rule. We're going to start talking a lot more about Cataclysm changes soon. <br />
<br />
The FSR provides some interesting gameplay (but at a pretty high complexity cost). We think we can engineer similar gameplay where choosing spell A over spell B is a mana-based decision rather than casting vs. standing still doing nothing is a (less fun) mana-based decision. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038607788-when-will-hybrid-tax-apply-to-fury-warriors.html))<br />
<br />
Cataclysm Healing and effects on PvP<br />
Ideally you'd go into an Arena game and not know immediately whether it was going to be an outlast game or a fast game. We don't have a problem with either case, but we think the overall experience is less fun when it's always and predictably one or the other (and in LK too often it's the latter).<br />
<br />
We're not really interested in over-emphasizing mana draining as a dominant strategy, but running someone out of mana by causing a lot of damage seems perfectly reasonable. If you can't run the healer OOM then really your only options are to blow someone up while the healer is controlled or blow someone up so fast the healer can't respond. Again, those need to be valid strategies. They just can't be the only strategy. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038607788-when-will-hybrid-tax-apply-to-fury-warriors.html))<br />
<br />
Hybrid Tax System<br />
We'll continue to polish it, but we're not fundamentally changing the design. We think there is plenty of evidence to suggest that pure dps would die off if more flexible classes could do everything they could do and more. Again though, in most cases gear or skill will have a much bigger influence on your performance than the potential maximums we engineer into the classes. While the averages more or less follow our general design (with some exceptions that we need to address), you can find plenty of individual parses where a hybrid &quot;wins&quot; or a pure &quot;loses.&quot; (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038607788-when-will-hybrid-tax-apply-to-fury-warriors.html))<br />
<br />
Farming Frost Badges in Heroics is boring<br />
Some players like having a reason to still visit older content and a reason to do something on nights other than raid night, while other players want to be able to log in, raid, and be done for the week. It's hard to provide an incentive structure compelling enough for the first guy without the second feeling like he has to grind. The emblem system has a natural tapering off period where you start to get everything you need and have less and less a reason to keep earning them. But it can feel pretty overwhelming when a new tier starts and you're counting up the hundreds of badges you're eventually going to need.<br />
<br />
The problem, and something for which we have a solution, is that the costs are balanced around the maximum badge income per week, which means doing both raids, the weekly raid quest, the weekly Icecrown raid quest, and a heroic run every night. That's a bit much for most players, but since the option is there, some feel like they have to do it. On the other hand, if you have more than one character you care about, then you could burn yourself out quick.<br />
<br />
There are alternatives though. As a simple example, if you could run all your Dungeon Finder groups in one or two nights for the week without having to log on every night, it might feel less grindy to you. (Again, for some players doing anything more than a few times is going to feel grindy, but it's impossible for us to develop content faster than players can consume it.) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23425468385-frost-badges--heroics-daily--sickening.html))<br />
<br />
Class Balance and FOTM Classes<br />
Actually, the evidence suggests otherwise. Rogues for example have been in a pretty good spot for most of the expansion in PvE and PvP but are one of the least popular classes. If anything I suspect there aren't that many true FotM rerollers probably because they imagine after they've put in all that effort to reroll that we will have adjusted the status quo in the meantime. If players really swapped classes with reckless abandon, I further suspect you'd see a lot fewer &quot;buff me plz&quot; posts. I also suspect it's more likely that players play the classes they like and then get frustrated when they think we aren't holding up our end of the bargain (which is a pretty reasonable response when you think about it). If the motivation was just to go where the damage is, there would probably be fewer passionate pleas to get everything so close.<br />
<br />
I don't know if shameful is the word I'd use. That's a pretty heavy one. DPS across the board is pretty close, certainly relative to where it has been in the past. We can still probably do even better, but let's keep things in perspective. Every class has multiple viable specs in PvE and in most cases if they have a spec that is lagging behind it's because it's dominant in PvP so we don't have a lot of room to just tweak up the damage. That's small consolation if you just love the Arms playstyle, but it's better than Arms being a completely dead tree (as Subtlety was close to being). In the meantime, if dps really matters to you, the Fury tree doesn't require massive regearing or relearning. It's not as bad I'd argue as a Shadow priest who has no option but to heal if he's not competitive, or a Balance druid who has to start over with gearing up in order to go kitty.<br />
<br />
I'd say it's close, but we can do better. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038607788-when-will-hybrid-tax-apply-to-fury-warriors.html))<br />
<br />
Healing and Mana Efficiency in Cataclysm<br />
You should be able to use your efficient spell virtually forever (or at least much longer than the average encounter length). That efficient heal may be fine for earlier dungeons or raids. Eventually though you're going to hit points where someone is going to die in between casts of the efficient heal. In those cases you should switch to an inefficient but fast or big heal. Yet, if you focus on the inefficient heals too much, you will run out of mana.<br />
<br />
As players gain more and more regen in later tiers of content, they'll need to rely on their inefficient heals more, but will also have the stats to be able to do so.<br />
<br />
Not every healer has enough spells to currently make the decisions between efficiency and other choices. In fact, we'll probably have to adjust the toolbox of everyone to some extent. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/24038459143-how-will-mana-be-an-issue-in-cataclysm-late.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Most healers spam one heal now. Druids for all of their spells can do very well with just Rejuv and Wild Growth. Disc priests spam PW:S and Holy priests spam CoH on cooldown. We want to carve off niches for other spells. Flash Heal can be awesome if it runs you out of mana to hit nothing but Flash Heal. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/24038459143-how-will-mana-be-an-issue-in-cataclysm-late.html))<br />
<br />
[...] Casting a couple of fast / expensive heals to save someone's life is exactly what you should be doing. Casting nothing but the fast / expensive heal because, hey why not, leads to pretty repetitive gameplay. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/24038459143-how-will-mana-be-an-issue-in-cataclysm-late.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We will have to change numbers for Cataclysm. It's probably a safe assumption that we'll adjust every number in the game in order to account for changes such as larger health pools, lower mana regen and all of the talent tree changes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/24038459143-how-will-mana-be-an-issue-in-cataclysm-late.html))<br />
<br />
[...] I was talking in the context of raiding, but the entire discussion of infinite mana is generally within the context of raiding. The fights are generally shorter in the 5-player content to where mana likely won't be much of a problem. It might be on some of the more challenging heroic bosses, in the same way that Loken was pretty punishing to heal when LK first shipped. If you go to your Flash Heal too often you might run out of mana, but with a Divine Plea, Mana Tide, Shadow Fiend or Innervate you should be good to go and the fight will likely be over (one way or another) before you need them again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/24038459143-how-will-mana-be-an-issue-in-cataclysm-late.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We want to shoot for a BC style model, except the choice will come from spell A vs. spell B instead of rank 3 of spell A vs. rank 9 of spell A. Downranking had some serious gameplay problems, most notably being an unintutive mechanic for new players and letting players in general cheese coefficients of lower ranked spells. The actual decision that downranking offered of efficient vs. big vs. fast is an interesting one though, and one we think is missing for too much of LK.<br />
<br />
To get there, many healers will need a new spell B or A, except potentially druids, who just need the numbers tweaked on some existing spells so that they have more defined niches.<br />
<br />
As someone who has spent a lot of time healing, I *think* it's going to be a pretty fun time for healers, though I'm sure it will take some tweaking before it feels exactly right. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038607788-when-will-hybrid-tax-apply-to-fury-warriors.html))<br />

Retribution<br />
Yeah, while Ret and Enhancement generally work out okay as cooldown-limited specs, we think we need to juice up the gameplay of both just a little bit so there are more opportunities to screw up, so that when you don't, you feel really awesome. Removing the chance of failure doesn't really make for compelling gameplay. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/24038607788-when-will-hybrid-tax-apply-to-fury-warriors.html))<br />

Enh Shamans useless because of 3.3.3 Icy Talons?<br />
My raid sat me, not because I didn't bring a useful chunk of raid synergy, but because some other guy brought it in a more convenient package. I'm sticking with the guild though. I love those guys, even though they don't let me play much, and I think they're going places with their penchant for min / maxxing.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, we'd like to iron out some of the disparities where one buff requires more maintenance or RNG or talent points than another, but I have a hard time imagining that many players are really being negative impacted by the relative convenience of identical buffs.<br />
<br />
Pushing for more awesome buffs isn't going to lead to more awesome buffs. It's going to lead to more homogenization and less group synergy overall. We'd be in a land where every raid buff or debuff just passively radiates a 1% bonus or whatever so that your group composition had an almost trivial contribution to your success. I'm not sure that would be as much fun though. We don't think the buffs have to be identical. They just have to be close enough that it isn't a major consideration for most reasonable guilds or pugs.

Heroic Strike / Next Swing Attacks<br />
<br />
We're not getting rid of Heroic Strike et al. We're just making them instant attacks instead of on next swings. The nice thing about on next swings is that they could consume rage without sacrificing a GCD. In reality though, I don't think that benefit is worth their downsides. A new player for instance hits Heroic Strike and doesn't really notice anything different happening. Not a great introduction to the warrior class.

I'd like to know about this too.. The items are BoE and bind on use, which indicates that they can be sold - but is that a mistake from blizz? <br />
<br />
Also, to those asking if it is raid-wide... I do believe it says that you get it, if you kill lich king while having a person in the raid with Shadowmourne - not necessarily yourself.</div></div><hr />

the way i understood this is that the whole raid can accept the quest and when they kill the lk with at least one shadowmourne in the raid, everybody gets the chest.<br />
<br />
my question would be if you get all the items inside or have to pick one. if it is the latter, is the quest redoable?</div></div><hr />

Portal Machine<br />
Tabard that turns you into the sun<br />

It looks like Blizzard decided to add a couple of flavor items to let you attract the attention even more! When you kill the Lich King with a player wearing Shadowmourne in the raid, you will get &gt;&gt;&gt;an additional item&lt;&lt;&lt; - Unsealed Chest.<br />

The items are either BoU or BoE, that means not only the whole raid can get any of them, but they could be sold on the AH as well. Nothing exclusive here.</div></div><hr />

My raid sat me, not because I didn't bring a useful chunk of raid synergy, but because some other guy brought it in a more convenient package. I'm sticking with the guild though. I love those guys, even though they don't let me play much, and I think they're going places with their penchant for min / maxxing.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, we'd like to iron out some of the disparities where one buff requires more maintenance or RNG or talent points than another, but I have a hard time imagining that many players are really being negative impacted by the relative convenience of identical buffs.<br />
<br />
Pushing for more awesome buffs isn't going to lead to more awesome buffs. It's going to lead to more homogenization and less group synergy overall. We'd be in a land where every raid buff or debuff just passively radiates a 1% bonus or whatever so that your group composition had an almost trivial contribution to your success. I'm not sure that would be as much fun though. We don't think the buffs have to be identical. They just have to be close enough that it isn't a major consideration for most reasonable guilds or pugs. <br />

We'll continue to polish it, but we're not fundamentally changing the design. We think there is plenty of evidence to suggest that pure dps would die off if more flexible classes could do everything they could do and more.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If anything I suspect there aren't that many true FotM rerollers probably because they imagine after they've put in all that effort to reroll that we will have adjusted the status quo in the meantime. If players really swapped classes with reckless abandon, I further suspect you'd see a lot fewer &quot;buff me plz&quot; posts.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nice... &quot;If we don't hybrid tax, we think everyone will reroll, but don't worry about blatantly imba classes, because we don't think everyone will just reroll.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yes a change you have no details on is a huge nerf, because you obviously know what they're planning. (And not all abilities are on the GCD.)<br />

Yes, it's free until level 10. So essentially you can try all the classes out to 10 and decide if you like. You can keep playing at 10 for however long you like though. It appears they consolidated starting areas too (Orcs begin in Chaos' starting area for example) because before that and the server merges you saw maybe one or two people on the way to mid-20s.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but now the question is, can Cruz do it again next week?<br />
Since it's a quest to open the chest, there is a chance he can't open it again, so you wouldn't be able to keep obtaining these items and pass them out / sell them every week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard can no longer create a balanced mana driven healing content. They will try but will fail big time. And why on EARTH should healers be the only class that have to think about their mana ? Its not like the dps classes (the ones that actually can rely on 1,2,3, button smashing) are having to think about it. <br />
<br />
The thing that Blizzard can change tho is to make the SMARTHEALS be extra expensive so that they are not spammed 24/7. It wont happen tho cause then Blizzard is taking the niche out of every healing class.. making them all the same.<br />
<br />
I personally see healing in Cataclysm become the biggest issue WOW has faced so far. To me it looks like it will go horribly wrong. Easy and hard is not based in skills in WOW. Its based on gear. So if healing is gonna be based on mana regen - that is 100% based on gear - then its a disaster waiting to happen.</div></div><hr />

I mean thats a huge nerf, an instant attack take a GCD which would mean no one would ever use HS unless it did more damage than slam, in which case they would be trading slam for HS. Even that would be a huge nerf still because one of the main reasons to use heroics strike on every main hand attack is that it changes that hit from being a white to a yellow so the hit requirement is considerably less.<br />
<br />
<br />
Looks like that so far, but I highly doubt Blizz are gonna just leave it that way. Spamming heroic strike kinda was killing my hand sometimes, but at least it was an easy and good rotation and I'd prefer it to stay that way.<br />
At least I'm really HOPING they'd finally remove fucked up scaling TG penalty.</div></div><hr />

You seem to have missed the point here, so I'll try to explain.<br />
<br />
1. It does not matter whether anyone complaining about them is able to kill the Lich King because the complain is that they exist at all.<br />
<br />
2. They do not enhance your characters ability in any way, shape or form, so why are they being given out to everyone else rather than being left along to give the class they belong to some flavor?<br />

This just in, The box drops a recipe that allows you to cook foods to Shapeshift randomly into one of the druid forms for 60 min, active while in combat. It will be platter-style, like a fish feast.<br />

(then maybe they would be forced to do some graphical touching up on Tree of Life and Moonkin form, so nvmnd this wouldn't happen.)</div></div><hr />

Also, how are Alliance supposed to turn in something to Sylvanas, or Horde turn in something to Jaina?<br />

EDIT:<br />
<br />
If only the Shadowmourne wielder can open it, and b/c its a quest you can only open it once, does that mean that only the Shadowmourne wielder gets it, and even then he can't (or shouldn't have to) let the raid roll for the contents b/c he can't open it ever again?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since I understand people cba to look at previous pages.<br />
<br />
The person with Shadowmourne is the only one who can open the chest. He can then distribute the contents to himself, the raid or the AH as he pleases, or as forced by his raid leader :P<br />
<br />
Which means, no, you can't ninjaloot the chest when it spawns.<br />
Yes, the Shadowmourne wielder can ninjaloot the chest and run away.<br />

Very unlikely, if you read the previous posts you'll find that its a QUEST item (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/51315/sealed-chest/) and &lt;b&gt;only&lt;/b&gt; the person with the weapon can loot it...</div></div><hr />

Definately shouldn't be exclusive for the shadowmourne wielder. Everyone in the raid has the right for those items. I'm atleast glad blizzard made it shareable with others.

what a douche :P..<br />
<br />
I'd like to see him getting the rest of his shards alone.<br />

and yet I'm sure many will keep the items and will the guild risk losing the Shadowmourne over vanity items, probably not.<br />

I think this was just an awful idea. Pretty unfair to mount collectors, and it reminds me a lot of the AQ questline when Blizzard stated they didn't wish to do something like that again (award one person with an exclusive vanity item from the work of their entire guild).</div></div><hr />

Doesnt change the fact that he raided with 24 in order to cash in on the legendary, which is cool.<br />

They most likely had no idea what was going on, as the first person to loot the lich king most likely got the item, the same way bloods for the shadowmourne quests were the first week, and EVERY OTHER &quot;This item begins a quest&quot; item.<br />
<br />
You know, where you go into a group and someone loots it, then your like aww man i hope mine drops i still need that. Yeah...<br />
P.S. Other guilds with shadowmourne have killed lich king since this was looted, it's obviously not 100%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Not to mention those chat logs show nothing, other then them stating only 1 person which happened to be the person with shadowmourne was able to loot it.<br />
And the rest was pretty much made up, since you cant trade the item in its chest form he has no way of knowing if you need a axe to open it like a key.<br />
The only thing that is for sure is the items inside are BOE, and for which i'd say thats alot of stuf for 1 person.</div></div><hr />

He can't be further from the truth. In PVE rogues are outdamaged by feral druids. Earlier they were outdamaged by ret palas, dks, and in Naxx by everyone.<br />

In PVP rogues are easily killed by anything wearing plate or frost mages. You just can't kill a 39k HP plate monster.<br />

Oh I agree with you 100% that this is an absolute horrible way to award a mount and that Blizzard made a very, very poor decision.<br />
I really thought they wouldn't do something like this, I am pretty shocked, they said they didn't want a repeat of the AQ40 chain (one person from entire guild gets a mount for all the guild's work) and they seemed to have headed away from that direction (achievements that award everyone in the guild a mount, hard mode rewards like Mimi's Head having 100% drop rate, etc) and then they do something completely idiotic like this? I really don't understand it.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Only Qruz was able to loot the chest&quot;<br />
<br />
So your translation of this sentence is &quot;Qruz was the loot master and he took the shiny epic item that no one ever seen drop before just because he has Shadowmourne&quot; or something like that? :)<br />
<br />
My guess would be that the loot master had no idea what the item was so he tried to give it to someone (himself, guild master, etc.) and received the &quot;player is not eligible....&quot; message until they realized that they can only give it to Qruz since only he is eligible because this is somehow related to his Shadowmourne quest line... Then the sentence above would make sense to me :) <br />
<br />
So your guess is that this is something like Onyxia's head that drops only if someone in raid has the legendary and its not even 100% drop, right? :) I really doubt that, but well, its only speculations, we will know soon how it works...</div></div><hr />

No, im saying he didnt need master looter, he was the first to click on the LK's corpse.<br />
If you look at LK kills, it has been killed since then on 25man with shadowmourne users with no drop.<br />
Either way, we will soon see the truth on tuesday or wednesday.</div></div><hr />

My raid sat me, not because I didn't bring a useful chunk of raid synergy, but because some other guy brought it in a more convenient package. I'm sticking with the guild though. I love those guys, even though they don't let me play much, and I think they're going places with their penchant for min / maxxing.<br />
<br />
Seriously though, we'd like to iron out some of the disparities where one buff requires more maintenance or RNG or talent points than another, but I have a hard time imagining that many players are really being negative impacted by the relative convenience of identical buffs.<br />
<br />
Pushing for more awesome buffs isn't going to lead to more awesome buffs. It's going to lead to more homogenization and less group synergy overall. We'd be in a land where every raid buff or debuff just passively radiates a 1% bonus or whatever so that your group composition had an almost trivial contribution to your success. I'm not sure that would be as much fun though. We don't think the buffs have to be identical. They just have to be close enough that it isn't a major consideration for most reasonable guilds or pugs. <br />

Wait, so GC plays an enhancement shaman?<br />

Logging in just to say this: what makes you think rogues should out dps feral druids? Feral rotation is about 4x as complicated as rogues AND ferals have to stay behind their target at all times to do their most basic attack. <br />

I would hope the class that actually has to work at their dps can out dps a class that just stands there and goes 1-2-2-2-3-2-2-2-3, ad nauseum</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its like: Oh hi healers, dps has like 6 legendary weapons by now so we will let you finally have one... however...<br />
-No it won't fit into Lore anywhere<br />
-No it won't be totally OP <br />
-No epic quest line for you<br />
-It will be replaced by a better weapon within the same expansion<br />
<br />
<br />
Then shadowmourne comes...<br />
- Awesome lore tie in behind it<br />
- Pretty sweet questline, when you use it you know how bad you worked to get it<br />
- Crazy OP stats and 3 gem sockets<br />
- The most OP proc I have ever seen on an item<br />
- Awesome flavor effect on your character when you use it<br />
<br />
Wait, its not good enough yet...<br />

Has any player/guild confirmed what this GM said, that its repeatable?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">palpahtine</div><div class="date">2010-05-24, 07:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I just wanted to clear up any questions as to the purpose of what the unsealed chest is for. I have spoke with gm's on the topic and they have confirmed that the chest is meant for the person with shadowmourne as a way of saying great job. I asked them why would they make the items bopu if they could forsee the drama it could cause, and they responded that blizzard made the items bopu, for the sole reason to allow the wielder of shadowmourne to do with the items as he or she see's fit. They stated that is if they want to keep all the items for themselves that is perfectly acceptable, and if they wanted to give the items away that is also acceptable that it is entirely up to them. So that sums it up, it is soley meant for the wielder of shadowmourne to do with as they want. If you guild is trying to force you to give up the items they are in the wrong, regardless if they view it as a group effort or not. <br />
<br />
The only time I really can see a guild having any imput into the loot from the chest, is if they provided all the saronite you needed to get started. Guilds are saying it was a group effort, and we had to change strats to get the quest done for them. Ok first off if the guild didn't provide the saronite, especially before the price dropped that is one large investment the person made on their own. Second, there is really no strat change to do the quest. This is what I mean: The abom is the same regardless, some think you haft to let one ooze not be slowed to get it, well they are just doing it wrong all oozes can be slowed, so no change in that one. Blood Queen: Someone always has to be bit, your just letting that peron be bit second and then they bite the next three after soaking one tick of blood mirror, so no strat change there. Sindragosa: Here is the only slight deviation from a normal strat in that the person has to soak 4 frost breath, but if done correctly they can get the breath and still dps, so no real change there, especially if it's the tank. So that stops that arguement on strat, and I pose this question, would the guilds still be raiding ICC 25 man every week just the same if there was no shadowmourne to gain, yes they would. I know of no guild that is only running ICC to get a person a shadowmourne, so with that your doing what you would anyway so as far a shards go, the guild really isn't doing anything special to help the person, just the loot master clicking to give them a shard drop.</div></div><hr />
