It's (finally!) time for the last batch of guides and a recap! I got a little behind on the schedule because of the PTR patch but we're ok now! First, all the guides are now available to the public in the following forums:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Guide Submission - Rare (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/323-Guides-Submission-Rare)<br />
Guide Submission - Uncommon (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/322-Guides-Submission-Uncommon)<br />
<br />
<br />
Guides in the &quot;Rare&quot; forum are usually better than in the &quot;Uncommon&quot; forum but this isn't always the case, it depended a lot on my mood when I read the guide and the type of guide you have. For example, a lot of Archaeology or Roleplaying submissions went there after I saw the guide to Roleplaying Gnomes because I knew they wouldn't win against that anyway, it doesn't necessarily mean that your guide was bad. <br />
<br />
We also have the last 3 winning guides today: <br />

Heroic Dungeons Difficulty<br />
I don't believe we ever said we refuse to nerf Heroic dungeons. What we've been trying communicate is that it wasn't our plan to make sweeping nerfs to Heroics within the first month of the expansion's release. We will continue tuning dungeons, trash, boss encounters, and abilities. Some of those changes will involve nerfs. This act just shouldn't be misconstrued as us changing our minds, or a sign that we're unhappy with the general level of difficulty of all Heroics.<br />
<br />
We don't think it was a mistake to start with the difficulty we did. We're happy overall with the progression path we have in Cataclysm. I think we've set an appropriate standard for this expansion, but we'll continue fine-tuning things (nerfs and buffs) to make sure the end game feels right as time passes. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/149910/cataclysm-heroics-being-nerfed-secretly))<br />

Baradin Hold Access<br />
We don't have plans to allow both factions to access Baradin Hold, regardless of who controls Tol Barad. We do have some balance adjustments we'll be making to Tol Barad gameplay in patch 4.0.6 though. They just haven't been listed in the patch notes as of yet.

The Daily Blink - Bitter Gnomes and Goblins<br />
Yes, they are bitter. <br />

<br />
What we've been trying communicate is that it wasn't our plan to make sweeping nerfs to Heroics within the first month of the expansion's release<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just my sleep-deprived brain but this kind of sounds like that they plan to make them after the first month or first few months of the expansion's release. Who knows, maybe I'm reading too much into it. Although, if they are considering making sweeping nerfs, I'll be a bit disgruntled. Difficulty is fine where it is, and they're fun now. Not just mindlessly mashing 1 button.<br />
<br />
Lastly, you're right, Gnomes are better. In the &quot;Shorter Than the Top of Your Boot&quot; category.</div></div><hr />

You really have got to learn about crowd control spells.<br />
This happened to me all the time at first, but after a while i started practically begging my fellow party members to use their crowd control abilities frequently, and i also used my mind control all the time. We are running heroics mostly like it were back in Wotlk, and I really would actually like blizzard to buff everything in heroics and make them harder, as they are about to become on par with normal dungeons, and normal dungeons going down to lower then noobs only dungeon level.</div></div><hr />

This has to be a minority. On non-raid nights, I'm on for maybe 1 or 2 hours. I have enough time to complete my dailies and do a random heroic. I mean, I did a heroic last night and it took about an hour. With CC and everything. Not to sound like a jerk, but if you haven't been able to complete a heroic, you need to:<br />
<br />
1. Learn how to CC or make recommendations to classes that can CC.<br />
2. Focus fire on the tank or main assist's target.<br />
3. Find a better group of people (if possible).<br />
4. Improve your own playing abilities.<br />
<br />
Blizzard has said that they aren't handing stuff out anymore. And I'm not even in the slightest bit upset. I mean, the first time my guild did a Heroic Deadmines run we wiped on Ripsnarl for like an hour (Yay all melee group!). Sure, it made us feel like complete morons, but we worked hard and completed the run. Now that we know how to do it, it's a joke.</div></div><hr />

The difficulty is fine where it is. Ive cleared PuGs of Grim Batol, Stonecore (without any cc) and Deadmines without a single wipe. On the other hand we couldn't get past the trash in some of the easier heroics with people dieing and thereafter rage quitting. Its the people not the game. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day its all down to luck and the group the LFD system assembles for you. Saying its unplayable isn't right. It will punish you if and when you make mistakes and will definitely make things a lot harder when you enter at the bare minimum ilvl (especially when the ilvl doesn't discriminate against main/offset/pvp gear).<br />
<br />
Some are admittedly longer than others and i have already seen the reduction in the number of trash mobs in some of the dungeons (Oafs on DM). But the level of difficulty is fine and it actually gets a whole lot easier with each piece of gear you upgrade.</div></div><hr />

Not true at all! The problem is that most people play DPS and they refuse to wait for more than a few mins for randoms.<br />
Just enter the LFD tool and start with dailies, auction hall scanning, questing etc.<br />
The best way to lower the time when you are a DPS is to get healing and/or tanking friends or guildies in your group.<br />
If you are talking about the difficulty you can just quit the game already. You're spoiled after playing too many WotLK heroics in full tier with all enchants and gems.<br />
Now go and learn the strategy for each boss, learn to use CC and start asking the random group members to use CC as well.<br />
It's easy!<br />
The main problem is that many people refuse to quest or do more normal dungeons when they have the required minimum item level to enter heroics.<br />
Use your brains: of course it will be hard in heroics when you don't have the gear!<br />
If you can't CC on top of that, you seriously need to learn how to play this game properly!<br />
<br />
Just my tree fiddy!</div></div><hr />

Nonsense. PUG's in heroics currently are perfectly doable with normal level gear and Justice Point stuff. It does help if you're a capable person that knows what he's doing though, it inspires confidence in a group. If you just mindlessly go into trash, or even bosses, with a WotLK mindset you will fail.<br />

I don't mind little tweaks such as trimming the trash in Deadmines. That doesn't affect the difficulty of Deadmines, it just makes it a little faster (that place takes forever even with a competent group).<br />
<br />
Also, I have noticed that heroics have already gotten a little easier now that more people have 333, 346, and even 359 gear. I've had less issues with pugs this past week.<br />

There will always be bad groups, but I think the heroic difficulty is just fine as it is.<br />

<br />
It's more like 50% not 90%. Anyway about half the guild I'm in tries to do heroics the other half kinda gave up on them. <br />
<br />
The problem is that heroics have to be done raid style if you want to actually finish them. If you try lfg pugs, 4 out of 5 fail before the first boss. <br />
<br />
Basically it's 5 man raiding. You need the right team mix, everyone to be ready at the right time and so on. This is not good for me, not for heroic 5 man dungeons. Cata is now hardcore and you need 4-5hours/day if you want to do something.</div></div><hr />

We barely CC anymore, or even communicate with each other while pulling - but yeah that's usually a guild group, pugs tend to go from very good to very bad. What bothers me the most is the time required to finish some of the instances. Some are a breeze while others take ages thanks to bazillions of trash, which is not hard at all, just takes time to plow your way through. <br />
<br />
Well luckily Blizzard &quot;fixed&quot; the Deadmines trash, now it's time to look at other instances too, like SFK (courtyard &amp; kitchen rooms before 2nd boss), Stonecore (cultists after 2nd boss) etc. Way too much trash. I like hard instances but trash doesn't make an instance hard, it just makes it 1hour instead of 30min to complete.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Bad players are the main problem with cata pugs, not blizzards design philosophy- except, of course, that it is their design philosophy in the first place that made so many bad players during wotlk. Fortunately cata will be thinning the baddie herd, so many of them will be gone before too long because they, like the poster who started this &quot;omg heroics are too hard&quot; notion, will quit the game because they cant l2p.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wish Blizz would just stick with what they say instead of changing their mind every week because players threaten to quit.<br />
<br />
They said they'd wouldn't make &quot;across the board nerfs to Heroics.&quot; That's a direct quotes BTW. They never said, we won't nerf any heroic, for any reason, ever. They'd be morons to say that. Let's play make pretend a moments. Let's pretend that there was, at release, a boss that more than 70% of groups wiped on consistently. Not once or twice, but consistently. Would a nerf be OK, then? What about 80%? 90%? &quot;No one has ever actually beaten this boss&quot;? I'm not saying there are any bosses like that, what I'm saying is that Blizzard deliberately never painted themselves into that corner. They knew they'd have to nerf a few a things, and buff a few things no matter what they did. Look at the changes that have been made so far. There's at least as many buffs as nerfs. <br />
<br />
They only really &quot;big nerf&quot; was to trash in the Deadmines. I did Deadmines last night (and I've done it before the nerf). The difficultly hasn't changed. All the big pulls are still there. What's changed is that now there are only two pulls of Oafs instead of five or six, four reapers instead of seven, three packs of a single Evoker and three miners instead of six... They made it faster, because you have fewer repetitive kills. The difficulty is still there.<br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just my sleep-deprived brain but this kind of sounds like that they plan to make them after the first month or first few months of the expansion's release. Who knows, maybe I'm reading too much into it. Although, if they are considering making sweeping nerfs, I'll be a bit disgruntled. Difficulty is fine where it is, and they're fun now. Not just mindlessly mashing 1 button. <br />
<br />
I suspect that they are, again, not painting themselves into a corner here. If, by tier 13, heroics are trivial like they were at the end of Wrath they probably want to option to cut down on some the annoying (Deadly now, annoying by then) abilities, like they did at the end of Wrath. By saying it this way, people won't be able to throw it back in their faces a year from now. <br />
<br />
<br />
Cata heroics are not playable. I've been in 3 groups yesterday that disbanded after 1-2 pulls. To be short cata is not playable. After you got all the gear from normal dungeons you can't do anything unless you want to play 4h+/day. Pvp is not an option as the pvp balance is still as bad as it was at lv80 in patch 4.0.<br />
<br />
This is just silly. I've been PUGing heroics since the third or fourth day of the expansion. My guildies were slow to level so I used LFG. I've completed every Heroic Dungeon in the game just fine except Stonecore... and that's just it's RNG. Only gotten it once for some reason (and it was one of the few groups I've had that fell apart). In the month since release I've had maybe 5 or 6 groups fall apart. Maybe. Use CC, watch your aggro, use survivability cooldowns, kill bosses.</div></div><hr />

I don't believe we ever said we refuse to nerf Heroic dungeons. What we've been trying communicate is that it wasn't our plan to make sweeping nerfs to Heroics within the first month of the expansion's release. We will continue tuning dungeons, trash, boss encounters, and abilities. Some of those changes will involve nerfs. This act just shouldn't be misconstrued as us changing our minds, or a sign that we're unhappy with the general level of difficulty of all Heroics.<br />
<br />
We don't think it was a mistake to start with the difficulty we did. We're happy overall with the progression path we have in Cataclysm. I think we've set an appropriate standard for this expansion, but we'll continue fine-tuning things (nerfs and buffs) to make sure the end game feels right as time passes.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well Nerfs or not the fact of the matter is that people are complaining &quot;It's to hard please nerf it&quot; , and i for one would like them to remain difficult. Being a Vanilla beta player and playing through all the content, This expansion has been challenging and I love it. The First bos in Herioc SFK is a pain in the rear, but after you get a difficult dungeon or Boss down there is that sense of accomplishment and the next time you are back in said dungeon or fighting said boss it will be a little easier for you. With Blizzard saying that&quot;Some of those changes will involve nerfs&quot; just means to me that they are afraid to lose player base because they have made the game &quot;to hard&quot; so to speak, but I say to the whiny QQers, Get off your butt get the gear that the hard core to semi hard core people have and then run those heroics. Heroics are suppose to be challenging and difficult. Not &quot;ok it is the start of the heroic lets just AOE everything and be done in 30 mins, and then on to the next one. So leave the heroics Heroic and if you can't do the dungeon cancel your account and go play Hello Kitty Adventures for an easier game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Xelestial</div><div class="date">2011-01-08, 05:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">ARGH! SO MUCH QQ ABOUT HEROICS AND NERFING! What the blue said, translated to me was: When we released the heroics, they weren't necessarily perfect or intended to be as easy or hard in some places as they are. So therefore if it needs to be nerfed or buffed, it will be nerfed or buffed and we're not scared to do it. But time will tell.<br />
<br />
It does not mean they plan to do sweeping nerfs of heroics, it's a game that is constantly updated to put the game at where THEY feel it should be. It's not static, and that's just how it is. Go play something else if you can't handle that they will buff some things and nerf others. I think they will put it at where the majority of the community needs it to be without sacrificing too much integrity. <br />
<br />
After getting gear, Heroics are quite easy with a guild group but they probably want it to be doable with PuGs too.</div></div><hr />

The only problem I have with some is that the have insane amounts of trash in some of the heroics, which was one of the things I hated in vanilla was that there was so much trash.<br />
<br />
I do agree with the people who say its 5 man raiding, but that's just to prepare people for the 10/25 man raids since the bosses there are like evolved version of multiple heroic bosses / trash mobs put together. I also happen to find the bosses this expansion much more fun, so I'm liking this Xpack so far.</div></div><hr />

You couldn't be more wrong. I've been doing nothing but pugging heroics. They have been all kinds of various group combos. Some have failed, yes. Most have succeeded. I don't have hours to play.

No Blizzard did something wrong, not the players.<br />
<br />
We have forever been told that Raids are where you go for challenges, Heroics and Regular Instances are for those who either did not like to raid, could not raid because of outside reasons, or just could never get down the mechanics. Now the guild I am in is fairly large, we have over 100 regulars (counting accounts) with prime time peaks of 40+ on. We have all sorts of people. The number that just are down on this expansion is amazing and it all is from one source, they do not like the new instances, worse outside of a handful none will even bother with heroics , they just level alts. I can't count the number of formerly great healers (good people, behaved and did what was needed etc) who are now doing alts. When the class you enjoy saw its ability decrease each and every level as you went up it makes the game no fun. People don't like feeling inadequate and making healing spells cost four times their original amounts does not make a class fun. Blizzard said challenge, well the only class they nerfed to accomplish this was healing specs. Sorry, that is just lame. <br />
<br />
People pay to have fun. Fun is not sitting in an instance for an hour or more. Before some elitist p comes back and says &quot;they all take 30 minutes&quot; well sorry they don't, we don't just run a select group of people. Being part of guild means we try to have everyone participate. We have to autistic children in this guild, they have a hard time understanding some of the mechanics used in the newer complex boss fights, even when guided on vent. So they are screwed even on regular runs because they don't react as fast. <br />
<br />
Blizzard failed to maintain the fun with CATA. The elite players can have Raids, leave the instances and heroics to the average player. Leave those players alone. They help make our guilds fun. They keep it lively. Yeah, occasionally we took one or two not good players on raids, but that when we had them on farm. Now we have to spend too much time helping them through regular runs.</div></div><hr />

If you read the original thread instead of only that comment you can see that the comment is only the response to someone who said that blizzard promised that they will not nerf the heroics. It seems that this tier heroics will stay the same.<br />
<br />
However no one knows what will happen when patch 4.1 is live, I think not even blizzard knows, it depends on how many new 5 mans there will be, the impact of new crafts etc, they will want progression from fresh 85 to complete raiding on heroic to take the same time as it takes now so if with this difficulty+ whole new tier it takes more time to progress there will be nerfs. Even if those nerfs will be only to make orbs tradeable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The queues are ridiculous<br />
Some of the content is crappy OP or cheap easy, all it needed is fine tuning<br />
Its not &quot;too&quot; hard.<br />
Some accommodations must be made, that don't involve nerfing or dumbing down the challenge.</div></div><hr />

We have forever been told that Raids are where you go for challenges, Heroics and Regular Instances are for those who either did not like to raid, could not raid because of outside reasons, or just could never get down the mechanics. Now the guild I am in is fairly large, we have over 100 regulars (counting accounts) with prime time peaks of 40+ on. We have all sorts of people. The number that just are down on this expansion is amazing and it all is from one source, they do not like the new instances, worse outside of a handful none will even bother with heroics , they just level alts.

It all gets fine after you get past the first hurdle which is gear - the game becomes fun as hell. I'm a holy priest myself and was struggling at the start of this xpac, but when I finally collected some gear with millions of wipes and such and we really rarely wipe now and I barely run out of mana on anything dungeon related. <br />
<br />
And don't bring autism into this debate, it's a game for the masses not minorities. Just because someone is missing a foot, doesn't mean they should stop selling shoes in pairs.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TobiasX</div><div class="date">2011-01-09, 02:00 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Cata heroics are not playable. I've been in 3 groups yesterday that disbanded after 1-2 pulls. To be short cata is not playable. After you got all the gear from normal dungeons you can't do anything unless you want to play 4h+/day. Pvp is not an option as the pvp balance is still as bad as it was at lv80 in patch 4.0. <br />
<br />
I canceled the subscription because it's no point to waist time with this game until they fix it.<br />
<br />
As many people have said, and keep saying, &quot;Go with a guild group&quot;. Alternatively go with people who you know and won't quit after 1 wipe. Out of the 20-30 heroic dungeon attempts I've had since cata was released I'd say less than 8 of those ended in a disband. The rest cleared it, even if it did take us a while on at least half of those clears.<br />
<br />
I enjoyed the difficulty of heroics on my main and now, leveling my alt, I'm annoyed that I won't have the same difficulty to look forward to. :(<br />
<br />

I suspect you started playing in Wrath of the Lich King. Heroic dungeons during The Burning Crusade could easily wipe players in Tier 5 loot (the second tier of raid gear for the expansion) if you didn't use crowd control and a lot of us actually liked that level of difficulty. As specific examples I clearly remember wiping in both Shattered Halls because we messed up CC on one of the early packs and Botanica just because we pulled too many mobs. You mess up: you wipe; that's fine. Yes, there were some walkovers (I seem to remember Ramparts being one of them) but there were also some very challenging fights in heroic dungeons for the larger portion of the expansion. You were introduced to the wrong version of 'Heroic' with regard to 5-mans.<br />
<br />
I am nowhere near competing with the best players in the world, in terms of raid progression or individual skill, but I've done every heroic except deadmines since launch and if people don't want a challenge then that's their problem.</div></div><hr />

How can you talk about TBC heroics and not mention Heroic Shadow Labs?! The room before the 2nd boss was a CC bonanza ... and half the time a sneaky rogue patrol mob would sneak up and start shanking the healer right after the trash pack was pulled.</div></div><hr />

The biggest problem is that people out there seem to have completely forgotten that they have cc, since it wasn't widely used last expansion - if at all. I've seen a mage who was told to sheep something say &quot;gimme a sec, don't have it on my bars.&quot; Same for a warlock with banish. It's tough now. I like it that way. Granted, it does occasionally make the RDF an exercise in patience, but eventually people will get enough rep to buy better vendor gear, and hopefully learn how to play their class to the fullest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you high? Did you ever step foot into a BC heroic? Those things were NOT for people who didn't know what they were doing.<br />
<br />
Hell, did you ever step foot into Strat or Scholo or BRD back in Vanilla? Cata Heroics are no harder than those were back then.<br />
<br />
<br />
Look, just because Wrath Heroics could be soloed by most classes at the end of the expansion doesn't mean that 5-mans have always been face-roll.</div></div><hr />
