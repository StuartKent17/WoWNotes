It's been an exciting year for MMO-Champion, and we've been busy launching new site features, expanding our coverage of the Blizzard universe, and welcoming new members to our growing community. Let's take a look back at what we've accomplished in 2017 as we start off the new year on a high note.<br />

If you want even more security on your account, you can enable two-factor authentication (https://www.mmo-champion.com/profile.php?do=twofactor) on your account and use Google Authenticator (Android (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2&amp;hl=en) / iOS (https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/google-authenticator/id388497605?mt=8)) or Authy (https://authy.com) to secure your account.

MMO-Champion 10 Year Anniversary<br />
Earlier this year, we reached a monumental milestone: MMO-Champion's 10 year anniversary (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6379-MMO-Champion-10-Year-Anniversary-Celebration). In addition to a variety of giveaways, community members were able to share their favorite MMOC memories, reminisce on the last 10 years of World of Warcraft news, and even test their MMO-Champion knowledge. Whether you've been a part of the site for years or you're brand new, thank you for spending some of your 2017 with us.<br />

MMO-Champion Premium<br />
MMO-Champion Premium (https://www.mmo-champion.com/premiumpromo.php) launched in November of this year, and it was primarily developed as a way for the community to support the site and browse MMO-Champion ad-free. Premium also includes a custom forum title and a new forum badge, all for just $0.99/month or $8.99/year. We'd like to thank everyone who has taken advantage of the program thus far, and we're excited to continue adding cool new perks to the Premium program in the future.<br />

At BlizzCon, the MMO-Champion team was able to say hello to community members, conduct exclusive developer interviews, and hand out a lot of MMO-Champion stickers.
