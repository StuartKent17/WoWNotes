Russian WoLK Retail Boxes and European Accounts<br />
We are aware that many of our Russian speaking players, European account owners, upgrading to World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King have purchased the retail boxes that only work with Russian accounts. Therefore, we have decided to make the European to Russian account conversion (http://www.wow-europe.com/migration/account-migration.html) process available again until 16 December (inclusive). However players that would like to keep their European accounts will be able to contact our Billing team (http://eu.blizzard.com/support/article.xml?articleId=23210) to arrange this. For all the details, please refer to the forums (http://forums.wow-europe.com/thread.html?topicId=6848316238&amp;sid=5).<br />
<br />
You should transfer your characters before converting your account. Thus, the free character migration (http://www.wow-europe.com/migration/) from European to Russian realms has also been extended until 16 December. Please check our character migration FAQ (http://www.wow-europe.com/en/info/faq/russianmigration.html) for further information. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Gear upgrades in WotLK<br />
Because we didn't make any big changes to gear itemization the improvements aren't as drastic in this expansion. If we assumed every player already had season 2 gear and made improvements to that from the initial quests, that would put some players at a disadvantage which we don't want to do.<br />
<br />
Keep leveling and keep instancing, you'll find upgrades soon enough. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12661302875-new-gear---where-is-it--in-lk.html))<br />
<br />
Battle for Undercity hotfixed<br />
The hotfix for this should be going live within the hour. We'll need a server restart for it to take effect, but after that the event should no longer hang. Thanks for all of the feedback. You should be able to take the portal in Stormwind Keep back to Undercity and pick the quest back up from Broll (assuming you were on the Battle for the Undercity quest).

Blade Barrier<br />
This was fixed for the next patch. It is a more appropriate animation. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12661301643-blade-barrier-is-annoying.html))<br />

Hunter concerns (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12065203251-hunter-class--arena--pvp--wotlk--read.html))<br />
Survival against magic - We think survival against magic is a legit concern, and unfortunately gets overshadowed by (some) hunters concerns versus melee. We are discussing changing Deterrence. <br />
Aspect of the Beast - We're not sure what we're going to do with Beast, but as you said, for now we basically consider the choice at 80 to be Dragonhawk vs. Viper. <br />
PvP against rogues - Dismantle - I think discussion of this one would end up taking over the whole thread. Bottom line is we wanted to give rogues a cool new ability. Many of their new abilities for LK were very situational (though honestly this one is too). <br />
Disengage bug - As I have explained before, the slow leap that occurs when snared is a bug. It shouldn't remove the snare, but the leap itself should not be slow. <br />
Freezing Arrrow - Freezing Arrow is a way to remotely deploy traps. It is not intended to be an unavoidable, instant cast, long range, instant effect, 10 sec crowd control that you can reapply every 30 sec. I can understand why you or any class would want an ability that reliably and unpreventably takes a player out for 33% of their time though.<br />
<br />
Hunters in Arenas<br />
To name just a few examples, we think the hunter mana situation is in much better shape now, we think your base attacks are not so dependent on shot rotation mods or macros, and we think Disengage is a button worth pushing. We tried some Arena maps with fewer LOS-blocking elements and no safe starting rooms. We gave pets some cool abilities like Roar of Sacrifice and decent crowd control.<br />
<br />
I know that the rest of this thread will be filled with counterarguments for why these are terrible ideas or won't work for whatever reason. That is the way these things go, where you need to argue from your point of view. So ultimately, it is probably best if I just say we want hunters to be good in Arenas and are willing to make changes that perhaps we weren't willing to make before to get to that point.

Avenging Wrath and Divine Shield on a 30 seconds shared cooldown<br />
That last part is still the plan. There are limitations to what we can hotfix. Those are essentially server-side changes. Changes to your client require an actual patch. Patches, sadly, are much more difficult to do. That doesn't mean it isn't important to us. It just means we have to test patches very thoroughly. Breaking everyone's WoW is almost always a lot worse than whatever bug or issue we were trying to fix.<br />
<br />
We will patch this before the first major content patch (Ulduar AKA 3.1). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12666303677-ghostcrawler--ret-paladin-wings-discussion.html))<br />
<br />
Fallback taunt<br />
We think this is one of the strongest reasons to go with a new ability – paladins don’t have a ton of snap aggro abilities at the moment. We're working on something now but it's too early to announce it yet. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/12643744594-tankadins-arent-very-happy-gc.html))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/rogue.jpg Rogue (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=630) / Talent Calc. (9095) (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?rogue))<br />
Fan of Knives and AOEing your way through dungeons<br />
We should keep the discussion of whether Fan of Knives is worth using a little separated from the idea of whether you can just AE your way through dungeon content. What I mean is that getting in the mode where only AE matters so we keep buffing everyone's AE doesn't really get the game into a place where we want it.<br />
<br />
By most account so far, you can't really AE your way through the heroic 5-player dungeons, so we'd like to see more people get to 80 and try those first. It is not our intent that CC and single-target dps are just a thing of the past. Sure Nexus and Drak'Tharon may be a little easy, but you know, at least people are running the level-up dungeons instead of skipping them. That's a good thing.<br />
<br />
Fan of Knives is a separate issue. We do want it to provide rogues with decent AE in situations where they need it, and it may not be doing that enough right now. We would just need to set up the mechanics to where you never wanted to use it on single targets. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/12661072422-ghostcrawler-where-is-our-hfb-fix.html))<br />

US - Free Character Moves<br />
More character moves have been activated to help lowering the queues on full servers.<br />
Why are the dates changing so fast on free character moves ?<br />
There are only a certain number of transfers we can allot to a new realm before populations on the new realm become another issue. This is why all free character moves are prefaced with a statement iterating that they should be utilized as soon as possible if you wish to transfer, as we cannot guarantee they will remain open for the specified duration. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12666203951-why-the-date-change-so-soon-on-xfers.html))<br />
<br />
Transfers to Fizzcrank<br />
We will be reopening free character transfers to the PvE realm, Fizzcrank, on Wednesday November 19 from 9:00am PST to 2:00pm PST. If you are looking to transfer to this realm, please be prepared to do so during this timeframe. No characters will be eligible to use the free moves to this realm once they are complete. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/12661603300-transfers-to-fizzcrank.html))<br />
<br />
Free PVE Character Moves to New Realm! 11/17<br />
We will be offering free character moves from selected high population realms to a brand new PvE realm, Dawnbringer, to assist in population dispersal. The ability to move a character on the selected source realms will become available starting on Monday, November 17 at 11:00PM PST, and is scheduled to run until Monday, November 24 at 12:00PM PST. Dawnbringer is a central timezone realm on the Retaliation battlegroup.<br />
<br />
In the event that these realms meet our transfer goals before the scheduled end date, the transfers to that realm will be disabled. We highly recommend that if you are planning to transfer that you do so at your earliest convenience. No characters will be eligible for these free moves once the transfers have been closed.<br />
<br />
You can begin your transfer by visiting the Character Move page located here: https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html (https://www.worldofwarcraft.com/account/character-move.html)<br />
<br />
We will continue to evaluate realms and add more free character moves as we feel they are needed.<br />

The last line = gold!<br />

But yes, you had to fight your way to get a Bear with a collander on his head, versus grind a bit to get a Bear with night vision goggles. Choices!<br />

Like all cooldowns ingame... it continues. If the time for respawn is within the maintenance, he will be there after server comes up again. Maintenance or Server-downs do not have any influence at cooldown times.<br />
<br />
Btw. Rare spawns dont have fix respawn timers, it can be very fast or takes very long for a rare mob to respawn... its random. Or did you find a raremob which spawns every 6 hrs? ...always?</div></div><hr />

Goblin-machined Piston (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44501) - 1000g x8<br />
Elementium-plated Exhaust Pipe (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44500) - 1500g<br />
Which comes down to 12500g per mount. Also note that the Exhaust Pipe has a limited stock.</div></div><hr />

On the official Wow forums I read some days ago that they would have credited our accounts with +2 gameplay days, due to the patch/general chaos with WOTLK. I've just checked my account but I still see the same days, did anyone notice if those 2 days were credited... or not? Credits were for both US and EU players, but not for Oceanic I bet. It's interesting to notice that if we sum up all of the hours of &quot;extended maintenance&quot; occurred in our paying life, I'm sure we should be credited with a LOT of time...</div></div><hr />
