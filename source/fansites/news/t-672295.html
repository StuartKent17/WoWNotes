I had to rush the video a little because of the official preview posted a few hours ago but ... here it is, a fairly complete preview of the Icecrown Citadel, the raid instance introduced with patch 3.3. 
 
Keep in mind that some of the monsters and objects are missing and the instance will look nicer on live servers.

Note on the Frozen Throne - The Frozen Throne is also obviously a work in progress. If you think that the area looks small I would also like to point out that during the Blizzcon, developers clearly said that some of the floor would collapse during the fight. Destructible objects can't be displayed in the video and it will most likely look VERY different when you finally get a chance to meet Arthas.<br />

<br />
<br />
Boub is an amazing dataminer, and even if you don't see it live, the models and textures of the zones and items/mount are in the game's files. Boub then uses some programs to get those models in a screenshot. Then he grab some fancy Krasus Landing background or some other place and slap the model there.<br />
<br />
He makes videos like this the same way people makes machinima videos, by taking the models and animations and capturing it on video.</div></div><hr />

I just hope (please please) it isn't 6 hours of trash and 1 hour of boss fights like the first half of BT (and much of TBC, really) was. :P I understand that trash &quot;paces&quot; a dungeon and makes it feel larger because it takes longer to move through corridors, but in this video I could see several rooms where I can imagine 10 pulls and 30 minutes just to move through that one room.

BT's trash was fine, it didn't even take anything close to 6 hours for the first few bosses. 2h and you would already be knocking at bloodboil/ros fights.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The tilesets are mostly reused from Icecrown buildings, and while it does make sense, some extra/unique detail could have helped in making ICC feel different from the rest of the Icecrown buildings.<br />
The ramparts area is so generic that if feels painful to the eyes.<br />
<br />
The Oratory stands out cause it has some unique design, and the Spire is bloody amazing.<br />
<br />
However the 3 wings look bleh. Plagueworks is a set of corridors with alembics, then we got corridors with blue fire and corridors with red fire. All wings have apparently ONE somewhat unique room, and while the blood wing last chamber at least looks inspiring with the veils and all, Sindragosa's lair is as plain as it gets.<br />
<br />
What bothers me the most is that the entire instance seem to be made of corridors and circular rooms, and well, ToC wouldn't be any cooler if the was a corridor between each identical room either would it?<br />
It's early to say, but I was hoping for some EPIC setpieces for these fights. Not only the place is fairly barren and repetitive, but the rooms seem actually fairly small. When you're reusing the same tileset you've used since the beginning of Icecrown, you could at least add some detail or some inventive room design. Also because since the possible boss mechanics have been explored to death (we know we will have the boss you need to taunt after 3 stacks etc), room design can really give some edge to the fight - think Al'ar, it's a very simple fight at the core, yet the room design gave it its unique twist.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So glad im playing AION now, much more pro :D (vanilla wow style) 8)<br />
<br />
Though, i like to read news about WoW .. since ive played it for 5 years ;)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Valtiel</div><div class="date">2009-10-07, 07:59 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">While I'm deeply enjoying Aion too, there's still nothing even remotely close to the scope of something like ICC in it, in terms of pve content.<br />
If you enjoy pve content, your best bet atm is grinding your teeth and hope Blizzard will finally get an instance right in WotLK.<br />
<br />
If anything, the comparison with Aion made me think about the epic factor. I was a huge fan of WoW's cartoonish graphic for the longest time, but they probably reached the point where they undermine the potential of the game's content.<br />
<br />
It's really painful coming from a session of Aion and logging for a WoW raid. It's not because of the pure brute quality of the graphics (which is of course huge), but for the design itself. It's somewhat scary to come from grinding nonelite mobs that look organic and believable and then log in for ToC and looking at Icehowl's body and consider that it's straight out from a saturday morning cartoon. <br />
It can't be helped and it's not Blizzard's fault, but to think that I got a bigger sense of awe from such a lowly (and repetitive and fairly bland) instance like Fire Temple than this Icecrown preview somewhat saddens me, but graphics do help immersion and I've really come to the point where I feel like WoW's buildings seem to be entirely made of plastic.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sharandris</div><div class="date">2009-10-07, 08:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nice, but once again I feel a bit betrayed.<br />
<br />
I really hoped that the special encounter of icecrown would be against the frostwyrm queen and not another vs. the other faction encounter.<br />
I mean it's a frostwyrm and we don't want to fight those from a building / the ground again. Nightbane, Felmyst, Sapphiron - none of these encounters is a true air battle.<br />
<br />
Standing on your air ship while flying over icecrown at high speed, pursuing Sindragosa is what I was hoping for.<br />
The tactics would envolve switching positions inside the air ship, manning a few (just a few) cannons to pull her towards the ship to allow melees to attack, maybe shooting people on her back Flame Leviathan style and evading all kinds of attack (tackling the air ship so you can fall off, breathing fire over the deck etc.).<br />
Hardmode would be to take out the other faction's air ship before they can actually help you.<br />

This would give this encounter a totally unique feeling, even though it's just a mix of old stuff combined with the boat / air ship mechanics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The tilesets are mostly reused from Icecrown buildings, and while it does make sense, some extra/unique detail could have helped in making ICC feel different from the rest of the Icecrown buildings.<br />
The ramparts area is so generic that if feels painful to the eyes.<br />
<br />
The Oratory stands out cause it has some unique design, and the Spire is bloody amazing.<br />
<br />
However the 3 wings look bleh. Plagueworks is a set of corridors with alembics, then we got corridors with blue fire and corridors with red fire. All wings have apparently ONE somewhat unique room, and while the blood wing last chamber at least looks inspiring with the veils and all, Sindragosa's lair is as plain as it gets.<br />
<br />
What bothers me the most is that the entire instance seem to be made of corridors and circular rooms, and well, ToC wouldn't be any cooler if the was a corridor between each identical room either would it?<br />
It's early to say, but I was hoping for some EPIC setpieces for these fights. Not only the place is fairly barren and repetitive, but the rooms seem actually fairly small. When you're reusing the same tileset you've used since the beginning of Icecrown, you could at least add some detail or some inventive room design. Also because since the possible boss mechanics have been explored to death (we know we will have the boss you need to taunt after 3 stacks etc), room design can really give some edge to the fight - think Al'ar, it's a very simple fight at the core, yet the room design gave it its unique twist.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I think it indeed looks rather bland. <br />
The instance layout these days really breaks down to corridor, circular room, corridor, circular room, corridor, circular room.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My comment wasn't oriented to gameplay; in that case, if you notice I pointed out at how WoW's pve content, while at its historical lowest point, is indeed more fleshed out than anything the competition has to offer.<br />
I could retort to your point considering that grindfest or not, Aion's actual gaming mechanics are a universe and 2 parsec ahead of WoW's absolutely horrible and outdated combat system. Another scary factor: Aion's horribly grindy, but at least it's fun to play. I was oblivious to the pitfall of WoW's gameplay till I tried something similar yet better developed.<br />
<br />
However my above point wasn't about gameplay, but atmosphere and looks, which is what the preview video is made of. And I was merely pointing out that like it or not, Icecrown could be a perfect advertisement for the Arthas' Playmobile Castle toys range. There's no life to it, it's just a big, blue, plastic cartoon castle.</div></div><hr />

Trash were too hard? cmon you need alot of trash in such place like Icecrown Citadel.. afterall Lich King controls such huge Undead Legion..<br />
<br />
<br />
No, not hard. Time-consuming. That's the point. Sitting through hours of easy crap to get to the real challenge isn't my idea of fun. Sorry. Challenge = fun. Wastes of time to get TO the challenge = not.<br />
<br />
SOME trash is fine. Enough to pace the place, to give the feel that Arthas really does control massive undead hordes. The latter would mean a lot of aoeable quickly-cleared trash, broken up by the occassional smaller pull of stronger mobs. But BT had far too much trash, it took 50 minutes out of every hour killing trash, ten minutes of actual bosses. One pull of stronger trash per room and a lot of aoe fast-clear = ok. Ten pulls per room of trash that isn't hard but takes 5 minutes per pull to kill just because of its design and/or tuning = bad bad bad.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
BT's trash was fine, it didn't even take anything close to 6 hours for the first few bosses. 2h and you would already be knocking at bloodboil/ros fights.<br />
<br />
<br />
I bow before your guild's speed-running abilities. Mine (and any other I talked to on my server) took about 45 minutes just to clear to Teron after killing Akama. Clearing enough of Supremus's room to have room to kite was a good half hour as well. I'm talking here about before it was outgeared and farmed for months, but getting sick of the place due to overtrash long before you even get sick of it due to overfarming is a bad sign.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

I think expecting normal mode 25 men instances to be cleared in more than one reset is not realistical anymore. The only answer is gathing or limited attempts or simply bugging bosses. It's impossible to design content that is meant to be accessible to over 50% of the playerbase and at the same time have it survive the attention of the hardcore guilds for more than a couple of days.<br />
<br />
If Icecrown is released without bugs, Arthas will go down in the first week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Very shortly: my lvl 25 tanking character has more dps moves than my level 80 Death Knight, and no fixed rotation. This even before I touch tanking. I won't digress on gear design, the absence of globalcooldowns, the approach to cast times and movement, the melee mechanics and way roots are handled, but it's honestly fairly hard not to find something wow does that Aion (or frankly 90% of the MMOs on the market) don't do better. Don't make me start on animations.<br />
<br />
WoW's strength is in it being a &quot;fast food&quot; MMO, but where this is a strength in the way content is handled (because of the constant instant gratifications and the easy of access), to me it becomes a huge weakness because, to put it bluntly, WoW is absolutely unfun to play. This is the point; this isn't about Aion. Who cares about Aion. The problem is that once you stop considering content, and gear, and instant gratifications, WoW is one of the least fun games I've ever touched. The gameplay is just bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You are pointing out the atmosphere, well thats where in my opinion Aion is lacking too.<br />
<br />
While the hotspots and cities just look enormous and are sure superior to WoW, the world in Aion is not as open as it should be in an MMO. You have this divided world, but i felt kinda like jumping from one sandbox to another. <br />
Those wingy thingy look very cool, but its like they only last a very short time and you can't use them anywhere, which limits you in the world much further.<br />
Just side notes to Aion, what freedom you have while you grind shit all over the place.<br />
<br />
<br />
So if we keep this cosmetic way, the ingame look is waaay outdated in comparison to Aion, and the additions to the engine of WoW are just plain minimal, as they will be in Cataclysm too. But it somehow always fits in the atmosphere and lore of Warcraft, like it was created in the very beginning of Warcraft:Orcs and Humans. Its Warcraft goddamn, they kept the feeling over years and years, in addition with awesome and epic soundtracks, maybe the very best ever created for games.<br />
<br />
Icecrown Citadel has its own style and just fits the scourge theme perfectly. I'm looking forward to it.<br />
And to add in some fanboi stuff, Blizzard Entertainment just is one of the very few game developers, that don't just throw in all their energies in cosmetic and best graphics. Just to mention Starcraft, aye.</div></div><hr />

I would try to keep the discussion on Aion to the minimum, because this isn't a website about Aion, it's a website about WoW. Suffice to say that I agree with some of what you say (the open world is much less open in most of Aion), but there's solid design choices behind it, and while Aion IS grindy, it's not more so than Vanilla was, and while I've not indulged into nostalgia so far (because I sincerely believe that at least till some point in TBC WoW has evolved and not degenerated), many times in Aion I find myself thinking &quot;wow, this feels just like Vanilla&quot; and it's... nice, I guess. But enough of Aion.<br />
<br />
I'm just commenting on how we've reached something that (despite the fact that I'm not big on the Warcraft Lore as some people I know, I personally find it extremely overrated) is probably the biggest lore climax yet in the game, and I find myself underwhelmed by what I feel is very generic instance design but more importantly a graphic interface that fails to capture my expectations as far as the Icecrown atmosphere would be. Enfasis on mine because the truth is that Warcraft has always been a cartoon, and while I've grown up ever since I first saw Arthas take on Illidan and thought &quot;cool!&quot;, there's no reason the game should do the same and change what it is. The blame is on me, most likely. But on the other hand, to add to the things that freak me out... despite being an old fart, I renewed my passion for D&amp;D lately, and it's scary how I'm getting a stronger D&amp;D vibe from a freakin' Korean game than from WoW. But I repeat, it's probably just me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Trash isn't necessary just a filler. Well developed trash can create the climax to a bossfight. Blizzard attempted this in the past (with mixed results - think Reliquiary, the idea of descending down a corridor with constantly spawning specters to face the horrible source of it all was cool, but the rushdown made it annoying more than anything else).<br />
<br />
As long as trash isn't made of pacs of undead orcs patrolling in a circle while the fortress is under siege - that is, as long as trash is deployed in a way that feels consistent and immersive with the idea of exploring and infiltrating Arthas' bastion, then trash can be a great thing to build up on the bossfights.</div></div><hr />

I think they've missed a trick here to distinguish Wrath, since Twilight Highlands in Cata (and SMV in BC) have more reason to be literally dark .. from their names!<br />

<br />
<br />
There are two kinds of people who complain about trash: people who whore epix and those who have only set their foot to Naxxramas.<br />
<br />
Yes, trash in Naxx was horrible aoe-fest that should've never happened. Trash in Ulduar on the other hand was partially even harder than bosses in Naxx. So like the poster I quoted said, please bring trash but give it a thought what it's going to be like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I really hoped that the special encounter of icecrown would be against the frostwyrm queen and not another vs. the other faction encounter.<br />
I mean it's a frostwyrm and we don't want to fight those from a building / the ground again. Nightbane, Felmyst, Sapphiron - none of these encounters is a true air battle.<br />
<br />
Standing on your air ship while flying over icecrown at high speed, pursuing Sindragosa is what I was hoping for.<br />
The tactics would envolve switching positions inside the air ship, manning a few (just a few) cannons to pull her towards the ship to allow melees to attack, maybe shooting people on her back Flame Leviathan style and evading all kinds of attack (tackling the air ship so you can fall off, breathing fire over the deck etc.).<br />
Hardmode would be to take out the other faction's air ship before they can actually help you.<br />
<br />
This would give this encounter a totally unique feeling, even though it's just a mix of old stuff combined with the boat / air ship mechanics.<br />
<br />
<br />
so fucking /sign! this would be an Epic Fight :D but Blizz like Dragons on or Through the ground i guess ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Trash mobs drop loot just very rarely. Also why is it that everyone looks at raiding now as a loot / hr mechanic. The free flow of gear from piñata bosses (expecially Naxx / ToC) is retarded. Getting upgrades is fun but give out too many upgrades for too little work and it cheapens the reward factor. If you have to eat your vegetables to earn the ice-cream it's not only good for you but makes the ice cream that much sweeter. People who eat nothing but ice cream don’t live very long and they don’t enjoy the ice cream as much.<br />
<br />
Hope trash packs resemble Uldar with mix groups of nasty mobs (Freya / General) that require organization and individual skill. Mindless AoE fests like Naxx or no trash like ToC detract from the raid atmosphere. It's the headquarters of the scourge the biggest and baldest undead are kept there. All the peons are out on the front line battling the Crusade what should be left should be a decent number of the LKs best. 5-8 packs of trash between bosses a number of patrols and at least one gauntlet event.<br />
<br />
Gear is nice to get but the awesome feeling you get taking part in an epic, culminating battle with the LK and his armies is a greater reward to me. Want a time / reward system farm Honor or Heroics for Triumph badges, want to take part in an amazing PvE experience raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually the inflation values are within expected range.<br />
<br />
For Blizzcon, I wanted to complain about the gear inflation in WotLK and how it was so much worse than BC with the many tiers of gear and the huge gap from T6 to T9 already seen.<br />
<br />
So I hunted up Kiljaden loot tables and found the 1H epic weapons he drops were ilvl 164 and dps 114.2. Then checking out old Kelthuzad's lvl 60 loot table I found his gear to be ilvl 89 1h dps 73.1.<br />
<br />
So using those numbers I found from end 1.3 to end 2.3 ilvls had increased by 1.84 and dps by 1.56. <br />
<br />
So right now at 3.2 top end items so far have 258 ilvl and 1h dps of 216.4. So from 2.3 to 3.2 we increased 1.57x ilvl and 1.89x dps. That means that we are still within target of the 1.84x ilvl boost come 3.3 putting top end items off of Arthas being ilvl 302.<br />
<br />
The only problem is that item DPS to ilvl scaling isn't linear therefore player damage is accelerating higher than ilvl multiplications. This is solved by HP inflation which has happened in BC and has been promised again to happen with Cata.</div></div><hr />

Ulduar was fine (though I think there was *slightly* too much trash leading to Vezax; maybe a couple of removed packs there would've been perfect). Naxx wasn't awful because at least it was pretty much aoeable and didn't serve as a huge timesink. My main complaint was about Black Temple, and a hope that this doesn't end up like BT v2, because BT's trash was far too copious and mundane. Trodding through that place was an exercise in true frustration, because trudging from boss to boss was pure boring. BT was like a return to Molten Core, only at least the bosses weren't just as boring as the trash like MC.</div></div><hr />

I guess I don’t share the same sentiments as many around here that it looks awesome. The death of Arthas will be closure on a culmination of Warcraft history over the past 7 years. <br />
<br />
Does it look good? Yes<br />
Does it look big? Yes<br />
<br />
Is the art fitting of the closing chapter of the story of Arthas? I don’t think that it is… <br />
<br />
I expected epicness and beauty beyond any scale that we have seen so far in WoW. It is a whole lot of blue and whatnot but other than the spire in the center it isn’t anything that we haven’t seen in the game already on one level or another. <br />
<br />
It is good but it isn’t Blizzard’s old level of good and it certainly falls short of my expectations.</div></div><hr />

I didn't really expect much from ICC, to be honest. When you insist on your final zone always being the darkest and dreariest you don't leave yourself a ton of room for a visually interesting experience. Maybe all those people who complain that Diablo 3 isn't enough brown and gray are having little orgasms over all the brown, gray, and blue in ICC. I really hope that the lore experience and the boss fights are great, to justify the epic hype of the lich king. <br />
<br />
I'm already kind of looking forward to Cataclysm. Deathwing is more interesting than Arthas anyway. Hopefully Cata isn't just &quot;the fire expansion&quot; the way that Wrath has turned into the &quot;Ice and snow&quot; expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
Well, most bosses in WoW are considered evil that alone gives a good reason for the raid to be dark. Also, this is The Lich Kings domain, The Prince of Darkness, The King of Death and Undeath, ect... It's not The King of Rainbows, Flowers, Bunnys and Pink Ponys.. It's expected to be the &quot;darkest and dreariest&quot; raid in the expansion and the game (so far) So I dont really see how it lacks &quot;a visually interesting experience&quot; I mean what were you expecting? Sunwell or TK? With flowers, trees, bright surroundings and fruity looking pheonixs? Don't judge the content before you experience it yourself, and also think about what you're saying about a raid that inhabits nothing but death, being too dark and dreary =\</div></div><hr />

<br />
Here's a brain workout: If it was a 5 man would you view the instance differently? Does a 25 man instance have to be visually more impressive than a 5 man? Why does it matter?</div></div><hr />

I disagree.. the Black Temple wasn't named that way for nothing, right? :p - I expected most of ICC to be made of ice.</div></div><hr />

ICC = Ice Crown Citadel. Crown = Top. The Top is made of Ice = Ice Crown. Giant Gothic-esk structure = Citadel.<br />
<br />
Put it all together!!! Ice Crown Citadel</div></div><hr />

(daily quest Slaves to Saronite, anyone?) Hell, Malkris, the Vile Hold was gonna be a Naxx made of nothing but Saronite. Arthas loves the stuff, so it fits in quite well, what I want to know is will we get to hear some distant part of Yogg still whispering through it as in the Saronite Mines.</div></div><hr />
