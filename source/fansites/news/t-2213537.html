Activision Blizzard Earnings Call<br />
The quarterly Activision Blizzard earnings call was today:<br />
<br />
<br />
Activision Blizzard had 431 million Monthly Active Users in the quarter.<br />
Blizzard's revenues from in-game content grew more than 25% year-over-year, driven by revenues from World of Warcraft in-game content and continued strength of Overwatch customization items. <br />
Blizzard had record first-quarter time spent, up a double-digit percentage year-over-year. <br />
With a regular content and feature update cadence, World of Warcraft time spent grew year-over-year in the first quarter. <br />
Legion's overall performance is slightly ahead of the prior expansion.<br />
Hearthstone set a new all-time Daily Active Users record last month with the release of a new expansion, Journey to Un'Goro.<br />
Blizzard had the biggest Q1 online player community in its history with MAUsA of 41 million, up 58% year-over-year. <br />
Hearthstone MAUsA grew year-over-year and quarter-over-quarter, despite no content releases in the first quarter, and recently surpassed the 70 million registered player milestone life-to-date. <br />
In late January, Overwatch had its fourth seasonal event, Year of the Rooster, to celebrate the lunar new year. The event drove engagement records for the game. <br />
Blizzard launched a fifth seasonal event in April, Uprising, including a player-versus-environment game mode which drew record time spent. <br />
Overwatch continues to be Blizzard's fastest growing new franchise, reaching over 30 million players globally less than a year after launch. <br />
Overwatch is now the 8th billion-dollar franchise in Activision Blizzard's portfolio. <br />

If you're going to resourcify BrM Mastery stacks, you'll need to modify it to stop stuff like this happening:<br />
&quot;Worst Case&quot; meaning 'if you never dodge except at 100% dodge'? Why model/consider something so unrealistic? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/857484068182568960))<br />
I just did some in-game testing. Out of 172 dodges (against 3 targets), 20 times EB reached over 100% before a dodge occurred. That's 11.6%.<br />
Yes, but that's a far *far* cry from &quot;Mastery between 28% and 42% is functionally useless&quot;. That's just false. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/857501754404904960))<br />
Those are merely breakpoints where the value per point drops somewhat. The value per point between those is not 0%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/857502138569605123))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
When developers/designers give answers that are less than satisfying like “the technology isn’t there yet”, was that usually the actual answer and the explanation for it would be technical jargon that would be too boring/advanced for most people to read/understand or was it a euphemism for something else like “too expensive for too little return” or “trade secrets, can’t tell you”?<br />
<br />
In my experience, it’s usually legit. My general philosophy is that game players are pretty intelligent and they have the power of crowd sourcing any problem, so they’ll usually figure out when you’re not being completely honest.<br />
<br />
So I will be honest that sometimes we are truthful but a little vague just because we don’t want a lot of folks with a little bit of subject matter knowledge but missing a whole lot of context chiming in about how we’re wrong. Those are kind of tedious conversations to have, and they don’t often seem to really end up with either party feeling better for having had the discussion.<br />
<br />
This sounds harsher than I intend, but the kind of thing you see a lot is “I took a couple of classes of computer science, so I can tell you for a fact that the problem is that the developers didn’t use Java and I could fix this problem in my sleep.” You get the idea. <br />
<br />
I see this a lot with statistics too. “Oh, but you probably forgot to exclude the level 1-30 players” or “You’re treating it as a normal distribution, but it should be binomial, or whatever.” It’s unlikely our business intelligence folks would overlook something really obvious, but if you try and engage in those conversations, it spirals out of control really quickly. It feels like you often get to the point where the only logical conclusion is “Okay, let me send you over all the data so you understand the nuance, and then I’ll walk you through how we came up with the analysis we did.” They are just long conversations and don’t often change the results. Maybe it’s a kind of victory if you get those few interested players to understand your logic, but you’re probably better off focusing your efforts on something with a better return for players overall. <br />
<br />
So we fall back a lot on “This is our conclusion from looking at the data,” which isn’t very satisfying for some players, but I haven’t yet come up with a more fruitful way to have the conversation.

A lot of work went into Garrison shit too, and see how that turned out. This is actually quite good news, considering that for past ~8 years WOW subs have been in steady decline.</div></div><hr />

He's been the worse thing happening to WoW ever. Since thee minute he took the job the game went super sh*t.<br />

A bit dramatic. If they listened to the community this game would be a hodgepodge of bad ideas. Have you seen the forums? They would make the worst game.</div></div><hr />

There's no getting wow back to its glory days. Metzen retired, it's only downhill from here.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lightbull</div><div class="date">2017-05-05, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Anyone say this coming, but the fact that it's better than WoD means that the game isn't dying anymore, and it's getting better. it wasn't dying in the first place but you get what I mean<br />
<br />
Also, this is in terms of earnings. WoD had hardly any content and a massive content drought after 6.2, so Blizzard would have spent less money. I'd argue Legion is doing miles better than WoD because a lot of work has gone into Legion in the last few months, meaning they spent more, and is still earning more than WoD.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont mean literally copy from the forum posts, that would be even more retarded than Ian's design, however starting listening to PTR feedback would be a great baseline and we would not have for example affixes that are obviously not QA tested, bugs into major encounters that are only acceptable on ptr or pre-alpha, decisions that destroy QoL and give nothing back or uninteresting timegating quests aka 7 fillers of the broken shore.</div></div><hr />

Why so salty? It's proven that MMO-Champ doesn't reflect the game's standard-players - hell, the MMO-Champion community is in fact pretty hardcore. So please don't take your skill level as an indicator for other people's gaming ability. WoW is NOT an easy game. I'm playing it since release and switching between characters takes a lot of effort (rotations, procs, gearing etc.), even for experiencend players. Then there is this crazy ass complex world with myriads of tasks and time sinks. I think the classic MMORPG isn't really appealing for today's audience anymore.<br />
<br />
Overwatch, for example, so absurdly easy to learn.</div></div><hr />

If it means player activity then it counters claims of Legion doing worse than WoD from players are leaving comments already being posted.<br />

So basically Legion is Classic wow only now people are so pandered they consider grinding to be detrimental to gameplay. <br />
Classic wow was ALL grind in every way. <br />
It wasn't alt friendly as alts took ages to level and even longer to gear. Remember 20 man UBRS for those last pieces of the set armor? Or hell, even the fire res cloaks and don't even get me started on amassing elemental resistance gear in 14 slot bags. There were no collection tabs so everything took up bagspace and alts had to get their own mounts. Those mythic guilds quitting just goes to show that people have gone soft.</div></div><hr />

People want classic wow but quit when faced with the same elements. Pathetic.<br />
<br />
People are blinded by nostalgia at times. Like many have said, MMOs just aren't really the type of game that people like nowadays. Nobody likes spending tons of time doing things that aren't fun for a game that's supposed to BE fun. It's much easier just to start a FPS or MOBA or even an single player RPG and instantly have fun with no commitment.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, this is in terms of earnings. WoD had hardly any content and a massive content drought after 6.2, so Blizzard would have spent less money. I'd argue Legion is doing miles better than WoD because a lot of work has gone into Legion in the last few months, meaning they spent more, and is still earning more than WoD.<br />

7.2 brought the sub numbers crashing down. Fact</div></div><hr />

lots have unrealistic expectations for wow nowadays. its impressive that it can still retain this. imo it doesnt really matter what wow adds anymore no matter what awesome feature gets added its simply not going to pull everyone in. People have lives. Me and a college friend very rarely get to play together on the weekend because school gets in the way and we are the target demographic. Legion had a great launch and it isnt until just a few weeks that people are complaining that the Broken Shore is weak and I agree although I am not holding it to some high ass standards as Argus is coming and I wouldnt be surprised to spend two patches there</div></div><hr />

The open world is essentially the same thing you've been doing since dailies were created, with a different paint job.

Classic wow was ALL grind in every way. <br />
It wasn't alt friendly as alts took ages to level and even longer to gear. Remember 20 man UBRS for those last pieces of the set armor? Or hell, even the fire res cloaks and don't even get me started on amassing elemental resistance gear in 14 slot bags. There were no collection tabs so everything took up bagspace and alts had to get their own mounts. Those mythic guilds quitting just goes to show that people have gone soft.<br />
<br />
It was fun, because the community was much different. Nowadays its more like a singleplayer with mmo aspects. Dungeonfinder/Raidfinder destroyed the community completely.</div></div><hr />

But wouldn't you agree that world quests are way better handled than dailies? I think it's way cooler to look at the map and see something I want (Transmog marks for PVP for example) and then specifically doing that WQ, in comparison to &quot;I need to be exalted with fat pandas so I can buy an enchantment for my shoulders which max my dps in raid X&quot;.<br />
<br />
As for doing the same stuff all over again:<br />
Well that's pretty common with endless games isn't it?<br />
In mobas for example you are playing the same map all over again, but it's still fun.<br />
<br />
If repeating stuff is not the thing for you, you should probably not play MMOs or just play the new content when it comes out (like one of my friends does it).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Or maybe... just maybe... a mythic guild rotated someone out for Elisande and brought them back for Gul'dan because their strategies called for a different raid comp. But that's probably too complicated and shocking for the kind of people who only want to check out your armory so they can call you out in public.<br />
<br />
<br />
OT: Legion has its good parts, but a lot of its &quot;content&quot; comes from extending gameplay elements by several orders of magnitude through grind, RNG and gating.<br />
<br />
Take something as simple as reputations for example. The basic elements haven't changed: you have a faction with some unique aesthetics, leveling quests and dailies (in one form or another) to earn reputation, and a cool mount as a reward. From BC on to MoP, going from neutral to exalted with a faction and earning the reward took a little under 30 days. In Legion, I'd say it takes on average 3.5 months to get from neutral to the point where a mount drops from a paragon cache.<br />
<br />
That's not more content, it's just a longer grind on the same type of content (and that's not counting the late introduction of the paragon caches). It might keep players subscribed for a while, but it's also burning them out a lot harder.<br />
<br />

<br />
Apexis areas and now World Quests were technical improvement on dailies in the sense that it's great you no longer have to go through the chore of picking up and turning in a bunch of them at NPCs.<br />
<br />
But you're still going to get burned out of going to the same places and doing the same things every day. Blizzard needs to shake up the aesthetics and story, and sometimes the mechanics of what you do to prevent people from getting bored. Legion hasn't been very successful at that.</div></div><hr />

People forget this. The game is over a DECADE old, of course it's not on the incline... I think there's a lot of players who are bored of the game, as a result they assume it's a total fault with the game and nothing to do with them not enjoying it anymore.<br />
<br />
I take the game with a pinch of salt personally, I've literally played since release and I fully understand the fact that the game is old as fuck. It's amazing I still enjoy it after all of this time, that's a testament to how good the game really is. I honestly can't think of any other game I could put in 973 days+ (edit: had to actually check my /time on each character after posting this) of game time and still look forward to logging in to.</div></div><hr />

Look at WoD how many store mounts and pets they pumped out all the time, this expansion has had barely any, gotta remember that those mounts and pets generally sell around a million each, which is around 20-25 million dollars missed in profit, per fiscal quarter, to put that in perspective it's the same financial value of around 1.1 million subs after taxes (It's actually more profitable than subs because unlike the game because it requires much less times and resources to patch it into the game).<br />
<br />
As for subs declining, let's be honest we know it would happen, wow has never been a stable subscription game past wotlk. It's always a very high peak at the start and it gradually drops down to about half of that number. Does it mean the game is dead? No, if you learnt anything, WoW has a very stable veteran club which doesn't really fluctuate much, they aren't going to quit over the things that the regular players quit over, because they have nearly a decade of time invested in WoW and that's worth more than the flaws, so they ignore the flaws most of the time.<br />
<br />
Though just when I look at my friend list, I have a lot of players that came back for 7.2 but they are the type of players that do a few things for a few weeks and quit again until the next patch.<br />
<br />
Which makes sense, there's so many players that do not have the time to play on daily basis, let alone play multiple hours per day to stay equal on a competition level, and most will actually quit simply because of the fact that they can't keep up anymore. So they just sub to test the new stuff for a bit and then they go play other games until the next cycle of content. <br />
<br />
To my experience all the friends I've seen quit over this expansion has been more about the legendary rng or ap grinding, or they hated the class changes. Personally I could see myself quitting over the class, because I think that the MoP playstyle of all classes was the best it has ever been and WoD/Legion are both the worst it has ever been (excluding one button vanilla rotations). Though I probably won't.<br />
<br />
I do see a problem or a trend with blizzard devs. They go full opposite compared to the previous expansion :<br />
<br />
Cata had nothing to do -&gt; MoP was overloaded with dailies.<br />
WoD had nothing to do -&gt; Legion overloaded with grinding<br />
Next expansion will have not much to do.<br />
<br />
Going from one extreme to another extreme doesn't do anything good it creates a sort of resentment towards the current expansion and homesickness towards the previous, until the next expansion where it entirely flips around again, they'll wish it was the previous expansion and not the current.<br />
<br />
Though the AP grinding is sort of fixed now. It scales so out of control... there's gonna be a point you won't have enough time in your life to invest into getting more traits. For example everyone that's grinding now, is literally burning themselves out, yes you'll have your titan trait faster, but when people reach AK40 (2-3 weeks before ToS opens up) they'll get from let's say 45 traits to 52 traits within 102 dungeons.

Another lesson that blizzard needs to learn is that gating by extreme values hasn't worked and will never work, you will always have the kind of players that will go beyond their own limits to make it happen, although, at the currently scaling of AK, there's going to be a point where you literally have be alive for 90 years to even get one trait done, but even then, there's still gonna be those that would try it (even though they physically can't).</div></div><hr />

It's proven that MMO-Champ doesn't reflect the game's standard-players - hell, the MMO-Champion community is in fact pretty hardcore. So please don't take your skill level as an indicator for other people's gaming ability. WoW is NOT an easy game. I'm playing it since release and switching between characters takes a lot of effort (rotations, procs, gearing etc.), even for experiencend players. Then there is this crazy ass complex world with myriads of tasks and time sinks. I think the classic MMORPG isn't really appealing for today's audience anymore.<br />
<br />
Overwatch, for example, so absurdly easy to learn.<br />
<br />
WoW is too complex for people to understand who don't know where to get additional information, guides etc. And it's not a new problem. I have met mages in classic who had strength and dexterity items - not only because poor itemisation back then, but also because they thought that they could be more effective with their swords like that. Now, if you don't know the weight of secondary stats and their importance for your spec, you go for item level and probably equip the wrong pieces if you don't have a guide or addons which tell you what's best for your class and spec. And this is just this fraction of the game. Constant tweaking of classes and skills does not help with this at all.</div></div><hr />

Dailies felt like a chore to me, while world quests simply offer something I can do if I want.<br />

Except that with dailies, you were done after reaching exalted and buying all things you needed from the vendor. If you returned to them later, it was only because you needed the currency/gold. Now, you are NEVER done as long as you still don't have all legendaries or need AP (which you will need for a long time, because this grind never ends), or still miss paragon reputation rewards.

<br />
Exactly. Even as an experienced player, you actually can't perform well without the help of class-guides, spreadsheets, tell-me-when-addons, dbm and other &quot;fun stuff&quot;. The gap between a beginner and a pro is so gigantic, that it overwhelms even loyal and skilled players from time to time.<br />
<br />
Most of today's players just want to hop in and out, play a few rounds and rank in some sort of ladder. That's clearly impossible for a game like WoW which requires a MASSIVE commitment to time management and team coordination, even if you play it casually.</div></div><hr />

Legion is better than WoD, but eventually people move on. WoW isn't a game I consider noob friendly. You could almost consider the design hostile to anyone that's only played popular games created in the past several years.<br />
<br />
yep. this. mmorpgs just isnt a genre for that ppl. so blizz should finally stop catering to them and focus on mmorpg players. they would earn over a longer period than 2-3 months (i.e. 1 year) more money. because mmorpg players are longterm customers. they dedicate to the game and invest time. masses will never do that.<br />

<br />
Anyone say this coming, but the fact that it's better than WoD means that the game isn't dying anymore, and it's getting better. it wasn't dying in the first place but you get what I mean<br />
<br />
Also, this is in terms of earnings. WoD had hardly any content and a massive content drought after 6.2, so Blizzard would have spent less money. I'd argue Legion is doing miles better than WoD because a lot of work has gone into Legion in the last few months, meaning they spent more, and is still earning more than WoD.<br />
<br />
and here lies the problem: how should blizz come to another conclusion like &quot;we spent a lot more and earned a little more&quot; so we can go back to WoD, its more efficient ?<br />
<br />
and to your first part: everything is better than WoD (or doing nothing). so its not that difficult to go upwards from there. that doesnt mean the uphill curve is starting.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
And if you don't cater to them at all, they simply never come. So you have 2-3 months of decent revenue vs 0 months of decent revenue. The choice is obvious.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
yep. this. mmorpgs just isnt a genre for that ppl. so blizz should finally stop catering to them and focus on mmorpg players. they would earn over a longer period than 2-3 months (i.e. 1 year) more money. because mmorpg players are longterm customers. they dedicate to the game and invest time. masses will never do that.<br />
That cannot be done, because WoW (as most MMORPGs) is way too expensive to develop. Unless you go full sandbox (i.e. players make their own content), and even about that I'm not sure. Art assets are a major money and time bottleneck these days.</div></div><hr />

yep i agree. this would make sense if blizzard start catering to the mmorpg crowd instead of the masses again. they pay for quality. longterm. masses pay for 2-3 months and some eye catchers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, no matter what number you believe between 100 million accounts created or the worst case scenario where people claim that WoW now has less than a million player - there are LOTS of different players and opinions. And that is just looking at this forum.<br />
<br />
Funny though how people keep saying &quot;this cant end well&quot; endlessly (aka &quot;things that killed WoW&quot;) and yet WoW is rolling and rolling. But yeah..one day the servers will indeed shut down, so I guess you are right that it won't end well.<br />
<br />
Thing is, with all the info and clever people out there who apparently know so much better who to cater to and who to target, there never seems to be a MMO who can draw in the crowds and beat WoW off the playing field. Not when WoW was 2 years old, not when it was 5, 8, 12. And when WoW was released, there were other big players established on the market that had years of advantage in knowledge and a loyal player base. And where are they now? WoW overtook them, I believe, within a year<br />
<br />
Not even that, franchises with a HUGE inherent fanbase and millions of sold copies with other games of the franchise stood a chance (looking at SWotOR and LotRO)<br />
<br />
Even if people want to make out Blizzard as clueless idiots....it is scary how much more clueless everybody else in the business must be then, because no matter what people try to do different or &quot;better&quot; than WoW, it never seems to work big time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
The reason WOW is a phenomenal hit..the reason it has a solid place in the history of video games........is because blizzard brought a mmo to the mainstream to the masses. <br />
<br />
So to say they should stop catering to the masses means they should stop catering to their market? The same market they had for over a decade?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niwes</div><div class="date">2017-05-05, 11:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Legion being slightly ahead in performance, it doesn't necessarily mean subs. Look at WoD how many store mounts and pets they pumped out all the time, this expansion has had barely any, gotta remember that those mounts and pets generally sell around a million each, which is around 20-25 million dollars missed in profit, per fiscal quarter, to put that in perspective it's the same financial value of around 1.1 million subs after taxes (It's actually more profitable than subs because unlike the game because it requires much less times and resources to patch it into the game).<br />
<br />
As for subs declining, let's be honest we know it would happen, wow has never been a stable subscription game past wotlk. It's always a very high peak at the start and it gradually drops down to about half of that number. Does it mean the game is dead? No, if you learnt anything, WoW has a very stable veteran club which doesn't really fluctuate much, they aren't going to quit over the things that the regular players quit over, because they have nearly a decade of time invested in WoW and that's worth more than the flaws, so they ignore the flaws most of the time.<br />
<br />
Though just when I look at my friend list, I have a lot of players that came back for 7.2 but they are the type of players that do a few things for a few weeks and quit again until the next patch.<br />
<br />
Which makes sense, there's so many players that do not have the time to play on daily basis, let alone play multiple hours per day to stay equal on a competition level, and most will actually quit simply because of the fact that they can't keep up anymore. So they just sub to test the new stuff for a bit and then they go play other games until the next cycle of content. <br />
<br />
To my experience all the friends I've seen quit over this expansion has been more about the legendary rng or ap grinding, or they hated the class changes. Personally I could see myself quitting over the class, because I think that the MoP playstyle of all classes was the best it has ever been and WoD/Legion are both the worst it has ever been (excluding one button vanilla rotations). Though I probably won't.<br />
<br />
I do see a problem or a trend with blizzard devs. They go full opposite compared to the previous expansion :<br />
<br />
Cata had nothing to do -&gt; MoP was overloaded with dailies.<br />
WoD had nothing to do -&gt; Legion overloaded with grinding<br />
Next expansion will have not much to do.<br />
<br />
Going from one extreme to another extreme doesn't do anything good it creates a sort of resentment towards the current expansion and homesickness towards the previous, until the next expansion where it entirely flips around again, they'll wish it was the previous expansion and not the current.<br />
<br />
Though the AP grinding is sort of fixed now. It scales so out of control... there's gonna be a point you won't have enough time in your life to invest into getting more traits. For example everyone that's grinding now, is literally burning themselves out, yes you'll have your titan trait faster, but when people reach AK40 (2-3 weeks before ToS opens up) they'll get from let's say 45 traits to 52 traits within 102 dungeons. Whilst those other guys probably did around a 1000 for the same progression. A lot of players are playing so much they burn themselves out and end up quitting because of it.<br />
<br />
Another lesson that blizzard needs to learn is that gating by extreme values hasn't worked and will never work, you will always have the kind of players that will go beyond their own limits to make it happen, although, at the currently scaling of AK, there's going to be a point where you literally have be alive for 90 years to even get one trait done, but even then, there's still gonna be those that would try it (even though they physically can't).<br />

i agree to a lot and have 2 questions:<br />
<br />
1) then why they dont start catering towards that crowd you mentioned in the first part ? instead of trying to cater to every fukin one on the planet (which obviously dont work) ?<br />
<br />
2) blizzard was a swinging pendelum from one extreme to another since day1 in wow. in every class buffs, nerfs, design, game reward systems. they always swing between balck and white only and never hit the grey area. so, how can a company manage it, to be and keep being that learn resistent after 12 years ?<br />
<br />
i will never get some wow related global descissions of blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Problem is if you do that then subs will plummet even more and there will be no major increases anymore when expansions come out. MMO in general is a dying breed, so it has to become adaptive and use parts from other genres to keep itself going. So either Blizzard gets a small but steady stream of income with large spikes occasionally (Patches, Expansions) or they just get a smaller, steady stream. What would you do as a business?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if people want to make out Blizzard as clueless idiots....it is scary how much more clueless everybody else in the business must be then, because no matter what people try to do different or &quot;better&quot; than WoW, it never seems to work big time.<br />
<br />
first: it just wasnt all the cleverness of blizzard brought them their success. if they did and act 2005 like they do and act today, they had never got the monopol they have since years. next thing is luck. blizzard had way more luck than brain. next thing is dedication. longterm mmorpg players dedicate to the game they invested a lot. blizz did things right in 2005-2007. ppl that played into wotlk were that much dependent on all their investment, they just didnt stopped, even when there had been a same good mmorpg. this on the other side keeps other mmorpgs falling on their start. because a mmorpg has to evolve from release to that great game. wow was the same. it was totally unfinished when launched with vanilla (hell there wasnt raids rdy). if at this time there had been a product polished and with dedicated players since years, wow never had did it. they had the luck that AoC and others sucked in polishing, delivering new content, evolving, etc. and ppl fast joined wow.<br />
<br />
second: wow will end as all that stories have always ended. some time there will be a new thing that do things better, offer more, maybe target more, has a better reward system, etc. and the same thing that wow made big will happen. the only problem is, that (as i said) most competitors cant even evolve a lot and a lot of the mmorpg crowd is dedicated to wow for 4-10 years and must see something bigger/better than wow in release 1.0, otherwise they wont test and game never can evolve to be on par or better than wow.<br />
<br />
third: i disagre to most of what you said, just alone for the mentality behind it. i could bring the same dumb arguments like you to prove the opposite. I.e. saying that since they stopped catering to mmorpg players and tried to cater to mass audience, with introduction of LFG mid wotlk and LFR in cata start, the sub numbers dropped and dropped and dropped. without any context i could argue, without any problems, the change in target audience is the reason for falling subs. and this would be the same stupid arguments, without any differentiation, that you brought.<br />

i dont want to attack your holy fighters (blizzard) so you have to start your white knight crusade, but from a logical point of view you are talking a lot of BS in my eyes, with the blizzard-goggls on your nose.</div></div><hr />

wildstar never had a chance to. it had the same high hopes (as wow in 2005) before they released wildstar. but since the game has to develop, they hadnt the time with enough players to evolve. and ppl checked 1.0, said meh and gone back to wow. in the same situation wow in 2005 had also be fucked up. for more details see my answer to det.<br />

MMO in general is a dying breed, so it has to become adaptive and use parts from other genres to keep itself going. So either Blizzard gets a small but steady stream of income with large spikes occasionally (Patches, Expansions) or they just get a smaller, steady stream. What would you do as a business?<br />
<br />
i dont believe in that model. my personally success as sw dev experienced the same thing. and i started beeing successful when focused on my niche. and every company i worked for or in, in the last 15 years, experienced the same.<br />
<br />
the thing is that you compare it wrong:<br />
<br />
you say, that they either hold actual mmorpg crowd subs + 2-3 months masses. and then compare it to ONLY that actual crowd without the masses. ofc thats worse. what you dont mention is the ppl that leaved or stay away from wow because they target the masses too.<br />
<br />
what you have to compare correctly is: either get some small longterm crowd and a big spike for 2-3 months, or get some mid longterm crowd without any big spikes for 2-3 months.<br />
<br />
i dont say what is better, because i have no data. i just say: compare it the right way. because you did not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And blizzard seemed to understand that and catered appropriately from wotlk to even WoD. Somehow and for some reason they got it in their mind that the way to make the game big again was to go back to decade old ideas of gating, rng and grinding to keep up the illusion of replay ability.

since we could look at all the patch notes and the history of wow, its barely hard to not to agree. i cant say how wow feels to a totally new beginner these days, but i see no facts that could stand against what you said. i.e. to click on tool and join LFR IS easier than to search 2 hours for a kharazan run in TBC. in this time you even had to know what you searching for and how raiding work. you dont need to know anything of this to join a raid these days in 1s to 5mins. <br />
<br />
so its hard to not see your argument as a fact. so i agree.<br />

<br />
I think a lot of people forget how popular WoD was at the beginning. It wasn't until a bit later when subs fell off the cliff, for obvious reasons. When the company says Legion is slightly better today, it's comparable to the same time period, not cherry picked to the worst time of last expansion for an argument.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The way I see it, none of us knows what the proper assumptions are (because in the end, thatis what we do..we assume) None of us works in the industry or ever will. Aren't we all the posterboys that Ghostcrawler might have had in mind when he said &quot;This sounds harsher than I intend, but the kind of thing you see a lot is “I took a couple of classes of computer science, so I can tell you for a fact that the problem is that the developers didn’t use Java and I could fix this problem in my sleep.” You get the idea. &quot;<br />
<br />
Unfortunately &quot;what is good for the player&quot; is also an incredibly stretchy term, because we have established that there is not one player but millions of people with millions of opinions. LFR can be good for one player and bad for another (as countless threads here proof). And there is not one feature in WoW that hasn't been met with harsh critique<br />
<br />
And yeah, I understand that a company making millions of dollars does not equate &quot;good games&quot; - because again, &quot;good&quot; is in the eye of the beholder. A company making a lot of money indeed only shows that they make a popular game that hits a certain nerve. Which Blizzard somehow now manages for over 20 years (or is it 25?). I don't even have to look at other companies. Out of the Blizzard portfolio, only WoW and Diablo interest me. Overwatch looks great nut I couldn't tell you if HS or HotS are &quot;good games&quot; because I just do not like that genre.<br />
<br />
Can you find a current game that everybody will agree on is &quot;good&quot;?<br />
<br />
To also answer to the underlying &quot;fanboism&quot; that always creeps into comments - it is not that I love Blizzard and think they cannot go wrong (because obviously there are quite a few things I disagree with in current WoW), it is more how everybody claims they know everything better for a fact.<br />

Did they really notice it as a &quot;mistake&quot; per se? And when did that happen? Because to me it seems we got the Cataclysm as an excuse to rebuild Azeroth so we can fly ther. An extremly popular demand. So it took them..what...over six years to realize this mistake?<br />

<br />
Nope. All you have to do is play an older iteration of the game to see where your argument fails (which i'm not advocating btw... :rolleyes:). <br />
<br />
In the beginning, leveling took ages but it was content. It was challenging, and getting to end game was massively rewarding in itself. <br />
Getting into dungeons took some organizing, but was rewarding. You could come out with a piece of gear which gave you a massive power boost and made the next 5-10 levels that much easier. You would also have to interact with the community, people you'd see about at end game in a few weeks/months time, and make friends while doing so.<br />
When you hit max level, you had an insane amount of things to do in which to progress your character before you were raid ready. Content felt literally endless and devs didn't have to gate things weekly (outside of boss loot) to give people stuff to do.<br />
Getting into raids felt massively rewarding when you finally did. And the beauty was that once you did, you were done with dungeons if you really wanted to be. There was still incentive to replay dungeons for badges and rep to fill holes in your gear. All stuff that felt rewarding with an end in sight, as opposed to an endless AP &amp; TF/WF grind that if you don't do, you can't compete. Nothing feels rewarding about being drip fed the resource that is vital to progress.<br />
<br />
Professions took ages but were massively rewarding. You could craft gear that would get you into raids, pvp or make you a ton of cash, which you needed to buy flying etc.<br />
Alts took ages but felt massively rewarding. You literally got to start the whole game again, with a new class with a ton of new abilities. You could explore zones you completely ignored the first time, with some larger bags, lessons learned and a more efficient experience. It was rewarding as hell to see how far you'd come and how fast you could get to 60/70/80 this time round with a new class. <br />
You're talking months to get to end game and it was never seen as a chore except by a vocal minority. People who picked the wrong class and wanted to start over complained that the time they invested was wasted etc. Min/maxers who had their classes nerfed complained that it would take them a long time to roll FotM again.<br />
<br />
Everything felt REWARDING. Making 60g for your mount at level 30/40 felt fucking awesome.<br />
<br />
Blizzard gave in to the demands of impatient players who wanted to be the guys standing on top of orgrimmar bank with their ZA bears and full t6 without putting in any effort. They trivialized the world content outside of end-game instanced content and made the world feel small and took away the magic.<br />
<br />
They invented systems that that let people access everything faster and faster until they ended up having to offer watered down versions of every aspect of the game to point where they can't push content out fast enough to keep up with the rate that players consume it with the help of their own catch-up mechanics and lobby systems. Now they have to resort to AP &amp; endless RNG as their only incentive to keep people playing outside of actual content which, not surprisingly, is now also the very reason a lot of players, like myself, detest what the game has become. <br />
<br />
People wanted things to be easier, which blizzard gave them, and in turn spoiled the reasons that made WoW such an immersive and rewarding game in the first place. The moral of the story is that players don't know what they want and Blizzard should never have listened to them.</div></div><hr />

Mythic+ dungeons have to go. It's a grind most ppl don't have the time for. Legendaries are not special anymore. That was a big mistake. The biggest mistake is the artifact weapon just because of the question where do we go from here? Take a retribution Paladin for instance, he held the Ashbringer, probably the most famous weapon of his order and if they won't carry on with those weapons he will hold some crap weapon next expansion that has better stats but is no Ashbringer. But these mistakes aren't the reason Legion has just a few more users than WoD. The reason is WoD itself. Many of my friends quit WoW because of WoD. They might have come back if Legion would've been way cheaper. But they didn't want to pay 50 bucks for an expansion that might be better than WoD. And because Blizz didn't give out any price reductions to atone for their mistakes a huge chunk of the playerbase didn't come back.</div></div><hr />

i cant agree. i loved no flying when the world was dangerous. when mobs unmounted you and could kill you. when i have to carefully plan my route. <br />

todays no flying means i ride across all mobs and if i get unmounted i stupidly brainless aoe grind that mobs for 5-10s and mount up again. its just annyoing.<br />

There's a happy medium. There's good and bad feedback on a plethora of topics. Plenty of feedback on how classes/raids/bgs/arenas/quests feel/behave/perform that's worth listening to. However, I'm of a firm belief that anything that's made the game easier/more accessible has ultimately been one of the biggest failings of the dev team (outside of near relatively impossible standards set by things such as original Naxx, etc.).</div></div><hr />

<br />
first: that was a good and diffrentiated text from you. it wasnt that superficial text i critized your texts a few weeks ago. glad to see that, and to see i was wrong. this is a good, strong and solid oppinion statement.<br />
<br />
second: i agree to most of what you say. there are a lot of things we just dont know because we have no data or insight. and since a lot of the information base is not existing for us, a lot of our arguments are based on assumptions.<br />
<br />
third: the thing i dont agree is that noone of us is in this industry. because i am. and i or ppl around me have to do the same descisions with the same (more or less) high risk outcome. some of us do the same things as blizzards managers or developers, just with an outcom/10or100 lower. but nontheless its the same thing and the same bigbusiness stuff. not all players posting on forums are that students, coding a hello world app and think they know how the business of software companies work.<br />
<br />
fourth: the othe thing i cant agree or better said that seems a bit weird to me, is that you say especially in wow there are that much niches, oppinions, stuff etc. Therefore in my oppinion its even more important to focusize on a specific crowd. bc all the stuff you mentioned as problematic to decide things is ofc problematic for blizz too. in some way you support my cater-more-to-1-crowd argument with your text.<br />

Agreed. And the mainreason for vagueness is that Legion is hardly something to celebrate (not as content or quality, but as economical performance). If Legion was going outstanding, it would have been expressed in a much more detailed way, since it is directed to investors and shareholders who want to know the good stuff. Now it has to be compared to the worst (again as economical performance), just to look ok and a little more positive.<br />
<br />
If you really want to argue this, just read the celebration comments posted for other games with the one short, vaguely described WoW MENTION.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Niwes</div><div class="date">2017-05-05, 01:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Nope. All you have to do is play an older iteration of the game to see where your argument fails (which i'm not advocating btw... :rolleyes:). <br />
<br />
In the beginning, leveling took ages but it was content. It was challenging, and getting to end game was massively rewarding in itself. <br />
Getting into dungeons took some organizing, but was rewarding. You could come out with a piece of gear which gave you a massive power boost and made the next 5-10 levels that much easier. You would also have to interact with the community, people you'd see about at end game in a few weeks/months time, and make friends while doing so.<br />
When you hit max level, you had an insane amount of things to do in which to progress your character before you were raid ready. Content felt literally endless and devs didn't have to gate things weekly (outside of boss loot) to give people stuff to do.<br />
Getting into raids felt massively rewarding when you finally did. And the beauty was that once you did, you were done with dungeons if you really wanted to be. There was still incentive to replay dungeons for badges and rep to fill holes in your gear. All stuff that felt rewarding with an end in sight, as opposed to an endless AP &amp; TF/WF grind that if you don't do, you can't compete. Nothing feels rewarding about being drip fed the resource that is vital to progress.<br />
<br />
Professions took ages but were massively rewarding. You could craft gear that would get you into raids, pvp or make you a ton of cash, which you needed to buy flying etc.<br />
Alts took ages but felt massively rewarding. You literally got to start the whole game again, with a new class with a ton of new abilities. You could explore zones you completely ignored the first time, with some larger bags, lessons learned and a more efficient experience. It was rewarding as hell to see how far you'd come and how fast you could get to 60/70/80 this time round with a new class. <br />
You're talking months to get to end game and it was never seen as a chore except by a vocal minority. People who picked the wrong class and wanted to start over complained that the time they invested was wasted etc. Min/maxers who had their classes nerfed complained that it would take them a long time to roll FotM again.<br />
<br />
Everything felt REWARDING. Making 60g for your mount at level 30/40 felt fucking awesome.<br />
<br />
Blizzard gave in to the demands of impatient players who wanted to be the guys standing on top of orgrimmar bank with their ZA bears and full t6 without putting in any effort. They trivialized the world content outside of end-game instanced content and made the world feel small and took away the magic.<br />
<br />
They invented systems that that let people access everything faster and faster until they ended up having to offer watered down versions of every aspect of the game to point where they can't push content out fast enough to keep up with the rate that players consume it with the help of their own catch-up mechanics and lobby systems. Now they have to resort to AP &amp; endless RNG as their only incentive to keep people playing outside of actual content which, not surprisingly, is now also the very reason a lot of players, like myself, detest what the game has become. <br />
<br />
People wanted things to be easier, which blizzard gave them, and in turn spoiled the reasons that made WoW such an immersive and rewarding game in the first place. The moral of the story is that players don't know what they want and Blizzard should never have listened to them.<br />
<br />
you could compress that into an opponent extreme example:<br />
<br />
think about a wow when pushing green eye button and get 16 epics and see all ingame videos and story immedeatelly.<br />
<br />
no one would play this game. and noone would play it longer than 5 minutes.<br />
<br />
- effort is a good thing.<br />
- challenge is a good thing.<br />
- dedication is a good thing (especially in mmorpgs).<br />
<br />
it all helps to keep a reward rewarding.<br />
<br />
and if you have to just DO stuff (maybe on a daily base) thats called a JOB. if you have to achieve stuff, put in effort for your reward, or overcome a challenge, thats called a GAME. or is at least the base idea of games in general.<br />
<br />
so why you want pay 15 bugs a month for a job? you want pay 15 bugs a month for a game. ppl often forget this, when they crying for faster rewards, easier challenge, or so called QoL changes.</div></div><hr />

They tried to reverse that mistake but the playerbase was already fat and lazy and didn't care about &quot;the world&quot;. They wanted their loot fast and for that they need flying.<br />

What utter bullshit.<br />

Flying doesn't make the world void of worthwhile content, just as no flying doesn't make the world engaging and filled with relevant content. Case in point; WoD. <br />

agree.<br />
<br />
maybe the only thing you could get out of this is a more bad direction than a good one. because since marketing is pulling out the best stuff of everything by stretching the reality as max as possible (to not become a straight lie) the term &quot;slightly better&quot; is very untypical for hyping marketing and that statement is &quot;the best they could make out of it&quot;. thats the only thing that scares me :)<br />
<br />
that numbers or statements are always fined. if &quot;slightly better&quot; is the fined version then that has some salty taste.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Which brings me again to what it is: Do they listen or don't they listen.<br />
<br />
The no flying debacle was used as a scapegoat for making WoD world content pretty much non-existant once reaching max level. Idiots gobbled up the kool-aid and suddenly Flying was to blame for everything wrong with the game, even though no flying didn't exactly make WoD a good expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It might feel tedious at the time, but when you finished grinds of the past you felt on top of the world. That's what made the game see 13m+ subs even if only the minority would see end game. The rest would look at those players and say &quot;one day&quot; and that was the only incentive they needed to log in every day.<br />
Now, you start at 100, 110 takes a week for an average player, 870 in few days, LFR cleared in 1 day, raid tier over with nothing to do, except do the whole thing again on a higher difficulty, with more stress and barely noticeable rewards, so we have this carrot on a stick element with AP and legendaries - grinds which feel tedious and almost endless.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's nice and all, but the world grew irrelevant and trivial just fine from the very start as players leveled up and got gear. Legion has more relevant world content which also SCALES than any previous iteration of the game, and what have we gotten? Players bitch that there's &quot;too much to do&quot;. Mind you, that bitching comes mainly from people unable to control themselves and pace their gameplay. <br />
<br />
I think it's a good thing that they don't cater the game around people thinking that time investment required = challenge. In Classic it was a big thing to reach max level. Not because of challenge, but because time investement required. Today, you need to put far more actual gameplay and SKILL into getting somewhere in-game. Less time is needed, but you're not considered a winner just by reaching max level and having 1 piece of epic loot.<br />

<br />
People pursuing LFR and then considering themselves done with the game would just as easily not play at all if they didn't have shit to do beyond leveling. The expansion where casuals were catered for = the one which saw this game boom the most. <br />
<br />
LFR funds the resources put into Mythic raiding, and that area has been top notch for years now thanks to this fact.</div></div><hr />

Not exactly a valid line of thinking. If you only cater to your current players, you will never experience growth.

yep. thats right. but on the other side blizzard were always conservative. even in the old days of wow they never tried some crazy stuff out, or put in little pieces of creative stuff in content. they always drived the safe way. foremost of being qualitative, balancable, well rounded, and stable. their conservative game design never allowed them to play with minigames in wow (there could be way more creative stuff than the simon says color game in TBC or the plants game) or play with crazy class ideas (because of balance). so going the same old safe route and only adjust things like how grindy or how rngish, was always the blizzard way.<br />

<br />
another one comparing apples with oranges. cater to a specific player type != cater to only your existing playerbase of that type.<br />
<br />
also &quot;new bloods&quot; could be a target of that catering. and also &quot;new bloods&quot; can stay away from wow because catering to everone is not what they like. <br />
<br />
ppl always doing like there is only 1 player type in 2017... and no, just because the world is full of 30min player ppls with no commitment to everything dont mean its the only existing player. and then they think by catering to other game design you only catering to existent players. thats just horrible wrong and stupid.<br />
<br />
ofc repeating 2005 shit dont helps. but if you make a solely 30min game out of wow, you loose 3 mio players and dont win 3 mio another potential players of that type, that will be 15-25 years old next year. but you win maybe 1 mio 30 min players (when they dont play another game in this second) and they will leave after 2-3 months. <br />
<br />
sometimes i get the feeling the game industry is creating a player type by designing games for them, even when this player type even exists yet. there are more than enough gamers out there that want to dedicate theirselfes to a good AAA game. not all of them are 30min superficial game hoppers.</div></div><hr />

Let me rephrase; The people not playing Legion because they tried it and thought &quot;Lol this is just like WOD hurr durr!&quot; and thus quit, are not the players the game needs.<br />
<br />
Same goes for the idiots looking at the quarterly report and thinking Blizzard's saying &quot;Legion is only slightly better than WoD in terms of content quality and quantity&quot;, rather than pointing to figures and activity. Being slightly better than WoD means probably that it's closer to MoP, which was also an amazing expansion with staying power even though a lot of players discarded it based on being unable to look past pandas. <br />
<br />
WOTLK had 12 million subs at one point, yet the world of Northrend was dead and PVE-people were sitting in cities spamming for groups all day long. Then came the Dungeon Finder tool, and people would still be sitting in cities all day long. I was considered weird for spending tons of time at the Argent Tournament for the mounts... <br />

<br />
Also &quot;overall performance&quot; can mean pretty much anything. The subs can be lower but that doesnt mean less people logging in. <br />
Now that there is WQs, mythic+ and stuff like that, people are more evenly logged compared to WoDs &quot;log to raid then log out for a week&quot;.<br />
Also overall performance might mean stuff like &quot;more server transfers bought&quot; etc - good for investors bad for players because they had to buy one to keep playing.<br />
<br />
Its in &quot;Deep engagemnt&quot; category after all.<br />
<br />
BUT Remember that they are vague for reason. No big corporation wants to say &quot;we failed&quot;. We dont know what subs are in US or EU. We dont know has it really been better since WOD on subs or player activity.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you're basically someone playing WoW and being turnt off by WoW having content.<br />
<br />
My point stands. Legion has more relevant content than any previous iteration of the game at max level, and people find a way to bitch and turn it into a negative fuel for their conspiracy theories regarding the dev team. Here's a thought; Maybe you just don't enjoy this game anymore, and nothing the developers add or don't add will change that?<br />
<br />
As someone enjoying this game, Legion is the epitome of what this game should be. Is it perfect? No, but that doesn't cancel out the things it's done right so far.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jyggalag</div><div class="date">2017-05-05, 02:32 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's nice and all, but the world grew irrelevant and trivial just fine from the very start as players leveled up and got gear.

I think it's a good thing that they don't cater the game around people thinking that time investment required = challenge. In Classic it was a big thing to reach max level. Not because of challenge, but because time investement required. Today, you need to put far more actual gameplay and SKILL into getting somewhere in-game. Less time is needed, but you're not considered a winner just by reaching max level and having 1 piece of epic loot.<br />
<br />
What a poor argument. The difficulty of the content, i.e. the grind to get there, meant that there were so few players to actually complete everything the game had to offer prior to the release of the next tier/expansion. The carrot on a stick in previous expansions was actually content and not AP and RNG loot drops - which BTW was still there, in the form of gear that you couldn't get on heroic/normal/LFR that hand't dropped from a boss yet, and legendaries like Warglaives.<br />
<br />
All content was relevant too. A new player would get to 70 and t4 would still be relevant when Sunwell was out. You could leave your character for a month and revisit the game to find a ton of players at the same level doing content relevant to you. Nowadays everyone skips previous tiers and jumps right into the most recent one and if you miss a few days you already feel behind everyone else.<br />
<br />
There wasn't a single player I knew after clearing Sunwell who felt done with the game. People from 15-40 years old, who had alts to level, gold to make and gear to farm.<br />
<br />
And the skill thing is the most retarded argument ever. I can safely bet I have more skill in my big toe than you, and it didn't come from the last two expansions. <br />
<br />
My balance druid in EN was the easiest it's been in years. MM hunter is a joke. DH is faceroll beyond belief. Prot warrior was unkillable. Monk has had its skillcap crushed since MoP. Raids are no longer about class skill, but learning bosses and pressing whatever lights up next out of your 4-5 abilities and min/maxing gear from split runs and chain running M+ for WF/TF gear. If you're chasing that cutting edge FoS, you better understand the mechanics of a fight and do your homework before progressing. If you're chasing world ranks, you better be on PTR and no life the shit out of that, and split run heroic raids as many times as humanly possible during the reset.<br />
<br />
You're absolutely not considered a winner by killing bosses faster than me unless you raid the same hours a week - you're seen as a no lifer with more time than me. If I get world 100 at 2 nights/week raiding, and you get 50 at 7 nights/week then you've no lifed the fuck out of it and everyone presumes you haven't missed a single point of AP since the launch of the expansion.<br />
<br />
PvP is a complete joke compared to expansions like WotLK and Cata. If you're actually going to argue PvP takes more skill now than previous expansions then your entire argument has 0 credibility and you need to stop talking about stuff you've no idea about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Difficulty =/= Grind. Just saying. People didn't struggle to reach max level in Classic because of mechanical difficulty (the AI of questing mobs is the same now as then), but because of the time investment it required. Everyone able to put in that time, got to max level just fine. <br />
<br />
To get somewhere in the game NOW, you need more actual gameplay skill than ever, and this fact has only gotten more cemented as every expansion has been released with more demanding endgame content from a performance point of view. Logistics have gotten easier, but personal performance requirements have gone up. Saying that Mythic raiding today involves nothing but knowing boss mechanics and mashing buttons as they light up is a testament to just how ignorant you are. Meanwhile, 90%+ percentiles on spec and class performance remains ever rare. <br />
<br />
I can assure you that you don't have more &quot;skill in your big toe&quot; than me, when you believe that overcoming a grind equals skill by default. What endgame PVE content have you done this expansion?</div></div><hr />

Blizzard always liked to throw specific numbers when things were going well and made sure everyone knew about them. On the other hand, when things weren't as good they were always vague or said they couldn't be specific because of some made up reason, and this time they were extremely vague which imo doesn't point towards good numbers.<br />

In the end it doesn't matter much since they will keep making stuff for WoW, some people will keep playing (some non stop, while others with breaks) and I doubt they will ever invest in a WoW2 since compared with other genres, it would make less of a profit now a days.</div></div><hr />

Because I'd imagine 1st quarter WoD was fairly successful.<br />
<br />
1st quarter of WoD saw 10 million active subs, if that's indeed what they refer to, then yeah...<br />
Interesting to see what Q2 will say in terms of retention.<br />

A WoW2 would also give loyal customers (myself included) a good reason to stop playing.<br />

Screw investing 9-10-12 years into a game only to have it broken down in order to try and drag new blood in. New blood whom often can't be arsed to get more invested in a game than remembering what level they're on in Candy Crush Saga...</div></div><hr />

<br />
To get somewhere in the game, you need more actual gameplay skill than ever, and this fact has only gotten more cemented as every expansion has been released with more demanding endgame content from a performance point of view. <br />
<br />
I can assure you that you don't have more &quot;skill in your big toe&quot; than me, when you believe that overcoming a grind equals skill by default. What endgame PVE content have you done this expansion?<br />
<br />
Cleared EN mythic raiding 8 hours/week in world rank 16 2 night/week guild on 2 different classes with 0 split runs and no PTR. Sold Nightbane runs for about a month.<br />
Last expansion? Highmaul world 36th in 3 night/week guild. Rank 5 ele shaman allstar logs in the world. All CM best times on two separate realms at end of the expansion.<br />
Before that? SoO mythic, 1000+ CM carries, all realm best CMs.<br />
Before that? Hero of the Alliance in RBGs - rank 1 team in Europe season 1 and 2.<br />
<br />
Your turn.</div></div><hr />

Not sure what server you were playing on but from the ones I've experienced, all of Northrend has actually been packed with players. The dungeon tool was a convenience but during 3.3 dungeons were farmed out at that point, its only gotten cancerous when it was available during the beginning of a new expansion.</div></div><hr />

In that case, assuming you actually did play yourself, you should be well aware that Mythic bosses don't go down if people just mindlessly mash buttons that light up. That was a thing in Classic, but hasn't been a recipe to down bosses since TBC. Look at how the best guilds in the world had to butt their heads against Mythic Helya. EN and Mythic Xavius in particular was viewed as a joke by the best guilds though, but a joke to them, not the remaining 99%.<br />
<br />
As for my own experience;<br />
<br />
MoP; Mythic SoO (didn't raid the first 2 tiers), Challenge Modes out the wazoo both in order to get the sets for every class and for boosts (gold) with my tank.<br />
<br />
WoD; HC all tiers, Mythic HFC but not the full clear, no world ranks. Did Challenge Modes and was going to repeat the same pattern as during MoP but decided not to once it became clear we'd unlock all weapons by finishing it once. <br />
<br />
Legion; HC EN, Trial, Nighthold, progressing Mythic Nighthold.<br />
<br />
In short; I have enough experience to know that you don't perform at the top possible percentile by &quot;mindlessly mashing buttons&quot;. If you got your world rank kills through doing just that in Emerald Nightmare though, I find it a bit more believable. <br />

<br />
Draenor and Silvermoon, only the 2 most populated PVE servers on EU. <br />
<br />
Northrend zones were not nearly as relevant at max level as zones in Legion. Legion might have half the subs of WOTLK, but I sure see a far more alive world thanks to the actual content in said world beyond leveling.</div></div><hr />

Nope, quit the game because of the same systems you claim to defend like the AP grind. I'd have to have a serious amount of cash to achieve all that with a pilot account. I wouldn't buy an account like that to quit playing either.<br />
Not once did I say bosses just went down.

Used to be someone like me who wanted to kill bosses by playing 2 nights a week could do so by mastering my class and a few wipes to pick up the mechanics. Sure, the bosses are harder, but that's not incentivising players to play, it's putting them off. People don't want to have to play 7 nights a week to kill bosses.

I don't &quot;defend&quot; the grind, in fact I'm downing Mythic bosses just fine and I can 100% honestly say that I have an attitude of &quot;fuck the AP grind&quot;. My artifact weapon hit 54 traits before 7.2 came out and I didn't grind. I'll max it out once more before 7.3 comes out just fine, and I don't grind. I always have something relevant to strive for in-game, always some way to progress even on my main. It used to be that once my main was raid geared, I'd run out of shit to do with that character until the next tier came out. <br />
<br />
Downing bosses still comes down to people playing their classes and specs correctly vs the boss mechanics. You won't get world rankings having my attitude towards the AP grind, but I'd rather play the game and enjoy it than bend over backwards and not enjoying it for some thankless goal.<br />
<br />
Hell, there's even complaints that raids aren't getting faster to clear and bosses easier in NH despite people learning the fights and getting gear. I've never seen this complaint before in all my years raiding. It's not a positive or negative thing in my book though, it just is. Granted, people are now roflstomping EN Mythic so perhaps the jumps in power vs content are meant to happen between tiers rather than within them.</div></div><hr />

Granted, people are now roflstomping EN Mythic so perhaps the jumps in power vs content are meant to happen between tiers rather than within them.<br />
<br />
So what's your argument? You've just had a go at players &quot;bitching about having too much to do&quot; in the context of the AP grind, and yet you admit you don't like it yourself. <br />
Going back to your previous comment about &quot;time investment =! challenge&quot;, players who want to complete a raid tier at a challenging mythic level are largely limited by time investment, which is more relevant now than ever. And the sad fact is that you're wrong about world ranks and your attitude to AP. Every single player who has achieved world ranks hates it. The only people that like it are the people who do content where the AP grind doesn't matter.<br />
<br />
Saying that the current progression system is better than previous expansions that had almost double the player count because mythic bosses are harder or the fact that world content scales is nonsense. Those things aren't mutually exclusive. It's not like RNG and AP has to exist to allow Blizzard to design harder bosses or implement scaling.<br />
<br />
Your 3rd point is an absolutely valid complaint. It's the reason a lot of top mythic guilds are quitting. When you've no-lifed a raid until it's on farm, your reward used to be a break from a demanding progress schedule to re-clear and farm loot for the next tier/raid instance. That's not possible when raids are still taking as long to clear week in week out, with 12 minute bosses taking just as long each reset. It's not healthy for the mythic raid scene. Most decent 2-3 night/week guilds that get manage to get cutting edge Gul'dan will maybe kill him a total of 1-2 times before the next raid. Burn out is guaranteed.</div></div><hr />

And yet here we are 13 years later. Hell that tombstone from The Daily Blink explains these threads perfectly.<br />

Claim it's dead all you want every earnings quarter but the fact is 13 years later and the game still seems to be going fine. Name one MMO that's still this successful 13 years later. Everquest, Everquest 2, Guild Wars, FF11 all MMOs from that time period are essentially dead as a dodo with barely any players.</div></div><hr />

what this guy wanna say is that Legion raiding is more dependent on stuff around than ever. <br />
<br />
the typical &quot;2-3 evenings a week&quot; hardcore raider that is dedicated to raiding and not more (maybe additional 3-4 hours with guild in dungeons, grind stuff, do quests etc but not more) and that wants to make &quot;the best out of his 2 raid evenings&quot; (by clearing hc and first few myth bosses, or by clearing mythic etc) has a really hard time in this xpac. and this is why some ppl hate it or leave.<br />
<br />
on the other side, if you are unemployeed or student, have just a single main char and/or play 7 days a week and need 5 of them to clear mythic, and want always something to do, you have the best time of your life in Legion (as long as you like grinding too as a raider).<br />
<br />
for years in my life i was in the second group. since 2 years i am in the first group. so i think i understand what he (and many 28-55 year old wow dedicated longterm players out there) means.</div></div><hr />

Legendaries will probably go next expansion anyway. No way they will keep them after the shitshow.<br />
<br />
Artifacts should be going after Legion. Who knows what will happen then. Probably go back to standard weapons.<br />

I think AP should have been for all specs. Maybe to compensate they could have cut the amount the other 2 specs get in half? I dunno just throwing an idea out.<br />

If they want to make the best then that's their choice. Nobody is forcing them. Especially with Tomb being less tuned around Artifact traits this time.

Ya after getting kicked from 2 guilds whom I told I was a tank with little dps artifact power who had me go dps most of the time anyway and then would complaine about my dps enough was enough why spend 20+ hours a week farming shit just to raid when I can go right to the fun shit in overwatch/lol.

<br />
yep. simple truth.<br />
<br />
make a chars power dependent on that much rng stuff and that much grind stuff, while excluding everything else, is plain and simple the WORST idea ever you can do in wow, when you played your own game longer than 1 xpac.<br />
<br />
and on top of that you release tripple spec which is nearly useless cause of trinkets, relics, AP, legendaries and a lot of RNG. what a weird shit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">det</div><div class="date">2017-05-05, 04:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">fourth: the othe thing i cant agree or better said that seems a bit weird to me, is that you say especially in wow there are that much niches, oppinions, stuff etc. Therefore in my oppinion its even more important to focusize on a specific crowd. bc all the stuff you mentioned as problematic to decide things is ofc problematic for blizz too. in some way you support my cater-more-to-1-crowd argument with your text.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
With options I mean you can decide to raid in several difficulties or not at all and still somewhat progress. And ofc there is stuff like &quot;pokemon&quot; or just hunting transmog (&quot;Barbie simulator&quot;). You can do only pvp or not at all if you chose. Etc etc.<br />
<br />
Fair enough that some people think one should focus on a special crowd, but I see with myself how I changed in my approach. From a no-life raider of almost 7 years with more than half of my combined 12 years of playing on just ONE (of 12) toons to somebody who now barely raids at all and hardly touches mythic 5 mans. Today I am an altoholic that collects artefact appearances.. In that way I am glad the game offers many things to chose from.<br />
<br />
Second guessing here ofc - but I think that Blizzard also tries to keep up with how players change. Which understandably annoys some of the more hardcore 1st day people.</div></div><hr />

Then again, people thought that of garrisons - but Blizzard decided they were basically not a bad idea and tweaked them.<br />
<br />
Sometimes I wish for an alternate timeline where Blizzard never added anything or tried different things. No flying, no LFG, no experiments with &quot;housing&quot; or adding another raid difficulty. No experiment with artifacts.<br />
<br />
My opinion is that WoW would have been truly dead by now.</div></div><hr />

Legion jumped the shark when they added all the new traits on the weapon. I mean seriously ... the AP hamster wheel is so bad. I just look at my weapon and it's hundreds of millions of AP its futile to even bother before i research more. So I go level an alt, and the hundreds of different quest lines i need to do again ... FML. <br />

And ofc there is stuff like &quot;pokemon&quot; or just hunting transmog (&quot;Barbie simulator&quot;). You can do only pvp or not at all if you chose. Etc etc.<br />
<br />
Fair enough that some people think one should focus on a special crowd, but I see with myself how I changed in my approach. From a no-life raider of almost 7 years with more than half of my combined 12 years of playing on just ONE (of 12) toons to somebody who now barely raids at all and hardly touches mythic 5 mans. Today I am an altoholic that collects artefact appearances.. In that way I am glad the game offers many things to chose from.<br />
<br />
Second guessing here ofc - but I think that Blizzard also tries to keep up with how players change. Which understandably annoys some of the more hardcore 1st day people.<br />
<br />
its not that unknown to me. i play since 2005 release without interuption. i since day 1 was an altoholic but always have my xpac main and raid. did pvp as well. i like it that there are a lot of options in the game. <br />
<br />
what i mean with cater crowd is not the different ppl that play the game different. i mean how long or much ppl play wow. an audience that play wow 2-3 months and leave forever should not be the target audience for wow.<br />
<br />
its even more an insult to everything added to wow over the years that is never used by players leaving after 2-3 months.<br />
<br />
even for a lower level player like lfr heroes there is no need to hand them stuff out in a short time. they could raid and evolve the same as everybody else, as long as they keep playing. but stuff like lfr is instead made for that 30min players, that level, do dngs and lfr and leave forever. no need to cater to them with fast rewards for easy stuff.</div></div><hr />

Would have definitely have been a big step in the right direction. IMO the fact that there is no cap and that it's effectively an endless progression system is it's biggest downfall. There will always be a group of people chasing as much as they can and getting burnt out from their own desire to be the best. There will always be standards set by raid-leaders that raiders will feel obligated to meet. In some cases, blizzard just need to save players from themselves.

An incentive to clear each dungeon once per week that got easier each week and was content outside of raids. More than enough for the average player to do and still allow time for other aspects of the game.</div></div><hr />

lots of that crowd are completionists or collectors. they love to get things declared as &quot;done&quot;. they have a &quot;checked&quot; mentality. AP grind is the exact opposite. it never feels &quot;done&quot;. ppl feels always unfinished or underperforming.<br />
<br />
thats a thing I DEFINETELLY would have in mind when i would design a thing like Legion for my customers. blizz either dont know their customers well or target another auidence (but which with longterm AP stuff ??? surely not the 30min players) or they just didnt think that much when doing game design.<br />

Wow is fine, and still enjoyable for some million players. <br />
The next xpac could be the last, could be not. I hope it's not.<br />
<br />
What it surely will not be - is vanilla 2005 kind of a disaster, with 40m lagfest raids and 2 month wait time on a bench, to get to the raiding spot for MC, every one here keep having wet dreams about.<br />
<br />
True, I always laugh when I see someone complaining about how much better WoW was in Vanilla, yet Nostalrius only had/has a fraction of the playerbase that live WoW has and it was FREE! If anything Vanilla WoW had a much higher skillcap (Mostly due to the lack of abilities for every situation, to which we have way more now) and the devs bended to whiners way less, how do they honestly think that would be a more successful business model? If players are quitting over the difficulty or un-approachability to the content now, then Vanilla would scare those players off of WoW forever if it were released today.</div></div><hr />

exactly this. never heard anyone complain about the valor system. it was great in pandaria to get your valor via many different sources. it was a currency. you get it the way you most liked until cap. and then spend it and progressed a little. nothing wrong with that.</div></div><hr />

This may surprise you, but a public forum, in which there is no subscription fee, which happens to be the biggest WoW related forum outside of official forums, which Blizzard will undoubtedly visit, is actually a great place to engage public interest and find out why people who aren't subbed, aren't subbed, and fosters just as much healthy discussion about it as anywhere else. <br />
I can post here without being a statistic implying support for design decisions I don't like, avoid paying £9.99 a month, kill some time at work, and hope that the game I've clocked 700 days in over 10 years revises some of the things I don't like so that I might play again in the future, since there are no good alternatives.</div></div><hr />

agree.<br />
<br />
Legion had a great platform and they invested time and effort again. but they split too much between 12 classes and 36 specs so many players just have a 36th of their effort/content. but way more worse, they put that massive RNG and grind D3 shit on top of an otherwise great platform, Legion is. and changed a lot classes not to the better.<br />
<br />
or in short: they killed an otherwise good xpac with their stupid RNG/Grind shit and their class dev team.</div></div><hr />

If they keep upping the ante, I could see Old gods, Titans, Void Lords. Others want the South Sea. MMOs do okay / survive on under a million players. So I doubt the next x-pac is the last, but who knows. Even there they might go the way of Diablo with one last x-pac and then a few years of the odd DLC at a price.</div></div><hr />

The people still stream Heartstone look completely bored out of their mind and who are constantly receiving fake donations who are inkling by with low qual ad spamming. Honestly, MTG-fanboy plug here, its more hilarious watching someone's perceived unbeatable deck get crushed by a prepacked deck due skill and luck. It's the teaers.

<br />
You have to remember this is an earnings call to investors. They don't give a shit about sub numbers, specifically. They care about money.<br />
<br />
&quot;overall performance&quot; most likely equates to level of money coming in and the amount of time that people are still playing, compared to WoD, to keep buying tokens (that cost more than a sub) and paying their sub. It has essentially nothing to do with how many are actually subscribed.<br />
<br />
Legion is all about stretching what content/features it has to the utmost to keep people playing longer for this reason. If the expansion didn't stretch everything out, there would be less money floating about for the investors to be happy about.</div></div><hr />

Which means Legion is defying the whole &quot;constant decline&quot; thing, which means it is not a failure, you idiots :)<br />

Also &quot;this could spell the end for WoW&quot; Jesus christ... Come on now, 3.3 million sales day one, likely nearly 6M subscribers right now. That is still one of the most profitable games on the market. Fucking clown haters on this forum.<br />

<br />
WoD and presumably Legion sold extremely well. Their subscription numbers jumped ahead for those first 90 days. WoD and now Legion's problem is retention.<br />
<br />
My takeaway from this is their push to two year expansion cycles was a seriously poor idea. Admittedly they never actually wanted 2 year cycles, they were forced into it because they repeatedly failed to release expansions faster. But from a business sense, they would be much better off releasing a WoD-sized expansion every fall... which was the original idea they failed to execute on. <br />
<br />
The plan for Legion was to buckle down and carefully trickle out the content so players were never more than a couple weeks from something new. But players are smarter than that. We're into week 15 of Nighthold and it's getting seriously old. The new content in 7.2 was class-specific and most people only have 1-3 max-level characters, so it seemed very content-poor. The weekly stuff they're trickling out now is horrible &quot;do 12 world quests&quot;. <br />
<br />
If you're Activision, what do you do? How do you steer World of Warcraft in a better direction? Well, they need to release an expansion every 18 months. 12 would be better. That's what players are excited about. Entirely new stuff. They need to figure out how to do that. For real, this time. No foolin'. <br />
<br />
IMO, Activision should spin off a Blizzard division in Montreal dedicated to churning out off-year expansions, just like they did for Call of Duty releases. 2016 you get the great expansion from Blizzard Irvine. 2017 you get the perhaps not so great (but at least new) expansion from Blizzard North. Every year you get that $50 box price and players get a bonanza of truly new content, which is what actually retains subscriptions.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, you should be happy that they talk about it, negative or not. The day they stop talking about it altogether, that's the day they no longer care about the game.<br />

You have to realise that most people don't actually hate the game. They just dislike the current iteration. They complain because a game they actually love isn't as fun to them any more, due to X/Y/Z change(s).<br />

<br />
If you ever go as a noob, no heirlooms, on a fresh server, and choose a class/role you've never played before with no bankrolling from higher toons, it's a very unfriendly game.<br />
<br />
The learning curve is steep. The community is unhelpful. <br />
<br />
And then, when you do get to max level, it's utterly confusing how I (a fresh frost mage, let's say) can perform so poorly next to another frost mage. Oh, they have better gear than me? Well that makes sense. I go get that gear. They STILL outperform me vastly? Oh, well I needed X leggo or Y trinket. Got it. Get those things...still getting mopped. Huh. Now i have to go track down a guide. Huh. Guess I was &quot;playing wrong&quot; even though I have a handful of skills to work with. Alright. I correct that. STILL getting mopped by some other dude. Oh, well there's this whole meta of stats, and when to use X or Y....<br />
<br />
TL;DR: Even after dumbing things down, it's still a very complex game where the RPG elements run deep enough (and the class design is complex enough) that it can be very hard to be competent.<br />
<br />
<br />
If I were to pin anything that Legion gets &quot;wrong,&quot; it would be the vast, broad application of RNG. It wasn't enough to have loot drops be RNG off a big loot table--now it's also in every aspect of the game, including crafting. I don't get to choose the stats on crafted pieces? And instead of turning in valor/justice for sure pieces, i turn them (shards) in for a completely random piece of gear for a slot? I hate it. I hate the RNG rewards, and they just keep going further and further into that design.</div></div><hr />

Sure, they swung and missed with the garrison/shipyard and Ashran but they were still trying new things. <br />
<br />
Legion is a bunch of recycled garbage. The artifact is nothing but an old talent tree, and like I said, they added &quot;content&quot; by making everything a grind, timegated or RNG. Run along and grind some AP now.<br />
<br />
I dont grind anything in the game I just play it lol<br />

They had a winning formula, and should have stuck with it, all the while improving graphics, lore and filler content, like pet battles, achievements and transmog etc.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a winning formula though. If we compare it properly, compare Legion to TBC (unless you wanna wait 7 years for enough content). At this point in TBC i was doing nothing, there was nothing to do. If you don't raid, and don't pvp, you...quit? Also the age of wonder is gone, MMO-C and other content sites have made sure of that with easy access to information. There is no mystery and it isn't the fault of Blizzard for that. Also locking story behind raids was a horrible idea, never encouraged me to raid just to be salty about it and have to watch videos with shitty music.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're never going to please everybody though. I wasn't initially a fan of the idea but they're genuinely fun as hell, and don't take anything away from the rest of the game. If players didn't like them, there was nothing they were missing out on by avoiding them apart from some achievements.<br />

<br />
Well the reality is that if you genuinely found yourself with nothing to do, then you weren't the target audience of the game at the time.<br />
If the developers wanted to cater for people who didn't want to do anything the game offered, they should have found a way to do so without taking anything away from the people who actually wanted to raid or PvP. You have to remember it's a game and not a book. The rewards should come from playing and beating it like every good game, not by just taking part. <br />
Not saying it was perfect by any means. They could have improved various areas of the game dramatically. As you've said; having to raid at a level beyond you to see the story play out is obviously not the best game design. There was certainly room for an LFR style mode that allowed you to experience major lore events first hand, but it should never have come at the cost of the community and player interaction that one would expect of an MMO. LFR today is in a good place and isn't something I would argue needs to go to give WoW its winning formula back. A lot of people will tell you it's the reason they still play today. <br />
<br />
I'm playing a server ATM and having a blast just farming and playing the AH. I haven't got any characters at max level and there's no rush to as I'm finding plenty of things to keep me occupied. There's definitely still mystery. I'm finding quests chains in remote areas of the map that i never knew existed. You're free to cheapen the experience if you wish by googling the answer in the same way you're free to google a movie ending before watching it.</div></div><hr />

We still have things that you couldn't find without googling in the current game as well, such as the Mind Riddler mount. However the problem with the older versions of the game (Pre WotLK) is it offered very little to people who didn't PvP or Raid. Problem with that is the people who do those activities make up a vast minority of people in total, and if the game were catered to them, then the game would die, easily. And while i do miss the community of back then, i would HATE to be forced to interact with the community now, given its relatively toxic state it has become.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">KrotosTheTank</div><div class="date">2017-05-05, 08:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Legion had a few peoblems, problems that made me quit for good, which I'm glad I did.<br />
<br />
1 Demon hunter balence ya I know don't play the new class if you want balence, but when you lock compeitive single target dps behind a single legendary item you did something wrong.<br />
<br />
Legendarys, after 4 shit legendarys in a row I had no will to continue on<br />
<br />
Artifact power grind. Anyone that had to play multiple roles early kew what a pain it was. You either have 2-3 shitty ones or 1 good one and 2-3 supremely shitty ones<br />
Artifact power should have been for all artifacts, make the grind longer if you have to to compinsate.<br />
<br />
Yet you're still here reading and commenting about it after you &quot;quit for good&quot;. You'll be back. <br />
<br />
Your first point is petty, and is far from the first time that's happened.<br />
<br />
Your second point you can cry about all you want, but that's how it goes, you deal with what you have, you aren't in the top 5 guilds, your specific legendaries are NOT going to be the reason you fail to do something.<br />
<br />
As for your third point, you're clearly still reading here, and if you had any basic math skills you'd realize that the disparity due to new scaling isn't NEARLY as bad as you think it is. For perspective, let's say you get a weapon to trait 52 (the break point atm, all else is icing and less important), you could instead have 2 weapons at 49 or 3 weapons at 48. That may seem like a big-ish difference now, but by the time ToS is released players will have at least 5-6 new AK. As it progresses you'll be even higher. When you get to trait...idk...75 let's say, which is roughly when it'll start being a chore to level higher, you could have 3 weapons at 71, which at that point is meaningless AND by that time, with how easy it is to get legos now you'll have every tool you need. <br />
<br />
People need to seriously stop thinking that having multiple weapons will be nearly as large of a burden as it was when the AP scaling from trait to trait was only 5% after 35, instead of the 30% it is now...<br />
<br />
<br />
And while i do miss the community of back then, i would HATE to be forced to interact with the community now, given its relatively toxic state it has become.<br />
<br />
If people were forced, once again, to rely upon each other, they'd learn to be less toxic, else they won't get as far as they can skate by now. When a community is emphasized, people will more likely treat others as they would in person rather than knowing that relative anonymity is saving them from consequences.</div></div><hr />

another one comparing apples with oranges. cater to a specific player type != cater to only your existing playerbase of that type.<br />
<br />
also &quot;new bloods&quot; could be a target of that catering. and also &quot;new bloods&quot; can stay away from wow because catering to everone is not what they like. <br />
<br />
ppl always doing like there is only 1 player type in 2017... and no, just because the world is full of 30min player ppls with no commitment to everything dont mean its the only existing player. and then they think by catering to other game design you only catering to existent players. thats just horrible wrong and stupid.<br />
<br />
ofc repeating 2005 shit dont helps. but if you make a solely 30min game out of wow, you loose 3 mio players and dont win 3 mio another potential players of that type, that will be 15-25 years old next year. but you win maybe 1 mio 30 min players (when they dont play another game in this second) and they will leave after 2-3 months. <br />
<br />
sometimes i get the feeling the game industry is creating a player type by designing games for them, even when this player type even exists yet. there are more than enough gamers out there that want to dedicate theirselfes to a good AAA game. not all of them are 30min superficial game hoppers.<br />
<br />
I am not comparing anything? I state how it is. A statement. Go on a trip elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

Yet those expansions had almost double the player-base of today. Your argument holds true only partly because the demographic has shifted and a lot of players who were &quot;old&quot; in video game terms are older now and can't commit to raid schedules, again, further emphasising the point that LFR and other world content that came with legion are great features and would have been welcome in TBC. The main problem of the game today is, as I've stated in earlier posts, that the devs decided to rush everyone into end game content and cheapened the rest of the game as a result. It's like inflating a currency. <br />
Players got so much spoon fed to the point where they can't possibly churn content out fast enough. After they made it so that people could queue for content and clear raids in a single sitting, players ran out of things that they enjoyed and the rewarding feeling went away. Who'd have guessed?<br />
<br />
That led to the AP system and the RNG style loot system of Diablo, which works for those players as it gives an infinite amount of replay value, but are a nightmare for players who did enjoy what the game offered at the time, and still like to be competitive today. There should either be a happy medium or the two systems should be separated entirely. There's no one size fits all solution, but there are blindingly obvious systems in the game today that should never have been implemented, if the game was to stay true to its roots.</div></div><hr />

They had double the player-base because it was the best MMO out there for most players, and F2P wasn't really a thing. Also the story tie ins brought people from WC3 over as well, which was my main reason of playing the game since Vanilla. I disagree that leveling should be the focus, as it was never hard or long, we were just stupid. Then leveling guides came out and the time it took went down, however i feel they need to put a massive increase in focus on the World and World content. Broken shore is a disappointment to me because if you just have one character the quests have no substance to them at all.</div></div><hr />

Those are all contributing factors but I disagree that 5-7m people would be turned off the game because some half assed alternatives came along with a lower price tag. An mmo is an investment. People become attached to their character as there's continually growth, and it's genuinely difficult for a lot of people to leave it despite its failings. I'll admit the story after WotLK never was just as interesting - but I never needed to have a deep understanding of the lore to enjoy the game. <br />
<br />
I never said the focus should be on leveling. I'm saying that leveling was at one point relevant and time consuming. It's an example of content that was challenging and rewarding outside of raids and pvp at end game. While some people found it tedious and cried for QoL improvements, they still logged in and chipped away at the grind that had an end in sight, unlike today where everyone's max level and they can chip away at improving their artifact, except there's no end in sight, and no rewarding feeling at the end of it. <br />
That feeling has been replaced for a lot of players by burn out as they force themselves to log in to keep a raid spot in a guild where they've made deep relationships with players they've spoke to every day for years, because devs are trying to simultaneously trying to cater for the most hardcore players by making bosses require maxed weapons, and casual players who just want something to do, with the same system.<br />
<br />
That's not even taking the TF/WF &amp; legendary systems into account, which, if you're unlucky, are a competitive player's worst nightmare.</div></div><hr />

Not in terms of quitting but more of getting new players, WoW is just not the only option, which is why no matter what formula they use i doubt we would see massive numbers for a long period of time ever again. But i do agree with the rest of your point when it comes to the balancing act with the repetitive grind. I like the idea of the AP system but their implementation just doesn't work out right now. I don't think they could make leveling any better now though, as we are talking only 10 levels instead of 60, and i am sure people wouldn't enjoy it taking a month to go through 10 levels, especially not raiders when the goal is for them to hit endgame as soon as possible.</div></div><hr />

Yes I agree. There's no going back to the days of old and campaigning for a u-turn at this point is completely pointless. I'm not advocating that they do. There's still a great game there with shiny new graphics, a fun new class to play, challenging bosses and more. Easy access for players who can't commit is also great for the health of the game. It's just no longer for me, as someone who feels they should be clearing the most difficult content on a modest 2 night/week schedule without feeling guilty if I don't log in every day, which has been the case for years prior to legion. If the devs could find a solution to that then they'll get my £9.99</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have to realise that most people don't actually hate the game. They just dislike the current iteration. They complain because a game they actually love isn't as fun to them any more, due to X/Y/Z change(s).<br />
<br />
Ofc, some people have gone far enough to genuinely hate the game and Blizzard and wish nothing but death and destruction... but still, that's a minority.<br />
<br />
I can agree that talking about it lets it live on. Just to bad this forum has turned into a venting forum for just the people who tend to hate everything blizzard does. I use to enjoy a lot of good constructive conversation on mmo champs a few years ago. Now it is just one thing after another. :) awe well at least i enjoy legion and i am looking forward to going to Argus!</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not surprising when they continue to backpedal on QOL things they add into the game then remove at a later date.<br />
<br />
Flying, Rep tabards, Dailies, Cata Heroics (which they realized was a mistake), Have Group will Travel ect.<br />
<br />
How long before they start removing dungeon finder, start back pedaling the questing to be lackluster and forcing you to just exp grind on mobs?<br />
<br />
Blizzard for whatever reason are stuck in the past, are constantly trying to get back to their more &quot;Hardcore&quot; (Grindy) roots, but that era has long passed in mmo's largely in part to blizzard themselves, and all it is doing is sending them further into the hole.</div></div><hr />

I am a mage and my friend is a warlock, since launch we have been raiding together always fighting for the top on the meters in each fight, but then suddenly he started pulling ahead from me after he got 2 dps legendaries while i got 2 utility legendaries (It was cool, everytime i blinked i was nearly unkillable) then patch 7.2 hit, the nerf to fire hit, the gap became higher to the point that i stopped caring anymore, he was always top3 while i was at best top 6; but two weeks ago i finally got 2 good dps legendaries and once again i am a contender for the top 3 dps on my raid alongside my warlock friend.

People need to seriously stop thinking that having multiple weapons will be nearly as large of a burden as it was when the AP scaling from trait to trait was only 5% after 35, instead of the 30% it is now...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If people were forced, once again, to rely upon each other, they'd learn to be less toxic, else they won't get as far as they can skate by now. When a community is emphasized, people will more likely treat others as they would in person rather than knowing that relative anonymity is saving them from consequences.<br />
<br />
I can still frequent this forum even tho I stopped playing wow, this is the first time i have posted in the wow section in months.<br />
<br />
And yes anger of the half gient was required to do anything similar to passable single target dps for havoc at launch, not sure if it still is but like I said, too late for me. Not sure why dh only had 2 talent trees anyway/why they made their only dps tree a super specialized one for aoe only, making havoc a bit more of a jack of all trades would have helped.</div></div><hr />

You have to realise that most people don't actually hate the game. They just dislike the current iteration. They complain because a game they actually love isn't as fun to them any more, due to X/Y/Z change(s).<br />
<br />
truest words ever spoken on this forum. seriously. a true statement written down so plain and simple, even the hardest &quot;haters gonna hate&quot; ppl can understand.<br />

<br />
I am a mage and my friend is a warlock, since launch we have been raiding together always fighting for the top on the meters in each fight, but then suddenly he started pulling ahead from me after he got 2 dps legendaries while i got 2 utility legendaries (It was cool, everytime i blinked i was nearly unkillable) then patch 7.2 hit, the nerf to fire hit, the gap became higher to the point that i stopped caring anymore, he was always top3 while i was at best top 6; but two weeks ago i finally got 2 good dps legendaries and once again i am a contender for the top 3 dps on my raid alongside my warlock friend. So much for the skill&gt;legendaries lol.<br />
<br />
forget about ppl that didnt get it. everybody with the least exp in organized hc or myth raiding realized since release that the actual class design needs low skill while legendaries, relics, trinkets and AP have a HUGE influence on dps. you can study other raids of your level on warcraftlogs and directly see how their dps get some stuff and go from 7 to 2-3 and so on. this xpac is totally derailed when it comes down to the relationship between skill, gear and grind. its that obvious when you raid regularyly.</div></div><hr />

I don't know why I have to keep explaining this but here goes.<br />
<br />
Time spent does not equal subscription volume. The &quot;slightly better than WoD&quot; metric is not subscriptions, its engagement (how long someone is staying logged in). <br />

<br />
and thats why they do more maintaining and grinding on this game... instead of going back to the better days of wow...<br />
<br />
they probably going to end this with a &quot;legacy&quot; where you can run all old dungeons and raids via timewalking...<br />
<br />
the game IS dying... but its a slow death.. and blizzard is preparing for it.... (more and more grinding for the hardcore-nerds and more incentives to pay gold for carrys etc for the casuals who join in once in a while) (even old raids cant be farmed for xmog because you only get 1 item IF YOU ARE LUCKY.. &quot;oh not on your loottable? sorry maybe level a *insert class with the item on the loottable here*&quot; to get a once a week chance or make a group and hope someone gets the item and doesnt want it.) &lt;- just an example for all the other grinding you &quot;have&quot; to do outside of legion content.</div></div><hr />

Because any chance people get to dump on WoW they do? Thought that was obvious. Oh only slightly better? &quot;Game is dying, sky is falling bla bla bla&quot; I remember when people didn't give a shit about subs or player numbers and just played the game for fun....</div></div><hr />

<br />
and why do people like you dont understand that MAUs are not people who are actually playing the game?<br />
<br />
why do you think blizzard is pulling people back in every month with some events ?<br />
<br />
because all they care is the MAU numbers... and MAUs are not active players...<br />
<br />
they earn the same or even more money with less players who are spending MORE money on blizzard games.... and do you really think that is GOOD for a game in the long run? have fun with playing you game online while there are only 100 people online to play with. (extreme example).<br />
<br />
thats also why its so dumb of publishers to seperate the playerbase with mappacks and other stuff... because the &quot;whales&quot; going to have less and less people to play with... which results in a worse experience for everybody... = people moving on... (they dont care about the games and the community.. they care about cashing out.. and pulling people back in with &quot;new&quot; stuff until they realize its the same shit over and over.. so they are gone again)</div></div><hr />

im kinda okay with that, I can stop myself from mindless farming until I reach something...but I do realize this is tailor to people on the edge of addiction and thats shitty business (there is amazing southpark episode about this...)<br />

<br />
key words here is that Blizzard had no issues with Ian, and they like how things are going, if I have said it once I have said a billion times, you vote with your dollar, and as there are 5 million at least still giving them money to play the game, they are okay with how things are going, you stop playing , then they will notice, but not before<br />

and a word to all the vanilla dreamers, you apparently were not around then, it was a miserable grind if you had no one to play with, the game is nice and stream lined now, the content just sucks<br />

You have to remember that at launch and slightly after WoD was considered a huge success because the sub numbers were still every high when they reported them. The problem was that so many people unsubbed when the launch was a colosal failure that it was the second earnings call that they started to get real worried about.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you are correct, however, if that would be the case currently, blizzard would rub those numbers in our faces like they did with overwatch or heartstone, but the way message was communicated makes me think that it is FAR worse than some optimists would like to show.</div></div><hr />

Why is that something weird? I quitted wow 3 months ago, yet i still check what's new every week or two (bored at work) to see if something interesting is happening that might make me consider re-subbing.

WOW is not an easy game. Figuring out what rotation gives decent results requires going to a web site, finding out which talents are trap talents, much weaker than the others, requires going to a web site, figuring out how to get to where a given quest is located requires going to a web site, figuring out which quests are part of a quest chain requires going to a web site, so on and so forth.

<br />
Exactly. WoW is not an easy game whatsoever to a brand new player, coming in never trying this game before. Imagine a new player gets an account setup, tries out a boosted 100 character, gets them to 110 eventually, and then does crappy. If you want to be a good DPS player ( meaning 800k dps minimum ), it's just stupid the amount of research you need to do, learn how to play it, and study guides, and test it out, and see what works and what doesn't, and still after all of that you may still have low damage. <br />
<br />
That to me, is not a causal friendly game. <br />
<br />
People just want to log on, level up their character, run some dungeons, dish out good damage and call it a day. Well not in this game, you will get kicked immediately unless your swinging 600k dps, hell even doing 400k is unacceptable for most people, and they will rage quit on noobs.</div></div><hr />

Because it was overall a good xpac? had content flow (not perfect but it was there most of the time), it had diversity in the content (not the same reused demon models for like everything, you actually had more than just green fire or purple-overload in the end game), cool new class and goofy race, thematically fresh ideas, new lore etc. How is that in any way &quot;odd reason&quot;? I mean you may like whatever you want (after all you'll find worshippers for every expansion - including wod), but objectively MoP had plenty of things to enjoy which is a good indicator of it to be at least decent xpac. Compared to Legion that had plenty of things to enjoy at first, but those things, while gaining in quantity, didn't continue offering anything &quot;new&quot;. In MoP you had a whole troll-thunder-mogu themed island, solo instances, raid, quest progression, all the good stuff.
