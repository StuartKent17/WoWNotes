Patch 4.2 - Updated Valor Points Rewards<br />
Valor Points rewarded were updated in the latest build of Patch 4.2, names have been moved around, item models have changed, and most importantly a couple of stats were changed. Among other things, Relic items now have a Prismatic gem slot instead of a Red one. <br />
<br />
See the updated list below, now with item screenshots. <br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
New SSDs are here, faster and more expensive than the current generation. Look for small price drops over the next few months as the last gen is put on sale. New AMD CPUs will be here in August or later, performance is still unknown. <br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date. If you experience problems after updating, roll back to the recommended Nvidia Drivers (http://www.nvidia.com/object/win7-winvista-64bit-260.99-whql-driver.html).<br />

New to building your own computer? ArsTechnica (http://arstechnica.com/ask-ars/2011/04/how-to-build-your-own-computer-ask-ars-diy-series-part-i.ars/) recently released a nice guide for new builders (Part 2 (http://arstechnica.com/software/guides/2011/04/ask-ars-computer-building-diy-series-part-ii-software.ars) and Part 3 (http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/guides/2011/05/how-to-build-your-own-computer-ask-ars-diy-series-part-iiicases.ars)). They don't talk about it specifically, but Artic Silver 5 (http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002EQU6C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=mmochamp-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0002EQU6C) is standard for thermal compound, avoid using what came with your heatsink. Usually it is easier to connect the case headers when the motherboard is not in the case, provided the wires are long enough. She does mention a five hour build time, two hours seems more likely. <br />

Oh and I forgot to mention how you can pay a guild to run you in heroic modes from the heroic boss drops to upgrade your gear to 391 items as well. Sure this won't happen a week after the patch is released, but in a month or two, but you know guilds will be rolling in the cash once their core raiders have been equipped.<br />

It looks alright on video, but it looks amazing in game. The flame effects are very well done, I just have one complaint. If you use the two hour on use, to enter fire form out of combat, and then enter combat: You lose the buff. It makes sense because normally the buff triggers upon entering/exiting combat. However it is a bit depressing to use the 2 hour CD, and then say something attacks you, you kill it, and then the buffs gone. Oh well, small issue, for an overall amazing item.</div></div><hr />

Right clicking the staff gives you the buff. Goes away when you zone or die, and puts the staff on a 2h cooldown (that's not to say you can't turn into a fire cat at any time, because you can regardless of staff CD if in combat)</div></div><hr />

That is raid rep ala ICC rep, BT rep, etc.<br />
<br />
It probably WONT be fast and who knows, maybe revered &gt; exalted wont even be awarded from trash and possibly even from normal mode bosses.<br />
<br />
Oh and those two trinkets? Suck. From ele PoV, Volcano &gt;&gt; both by large margin and even normal Theralion would be better than the crit one and probably on par with the spirit one... depending on how spirit heavy will be the rest of the 4.2 gear, because honestly, even in 359 gear, you have so much spirit you actually reforge out of it anyway. Heroic Theralion is just flat out better. Even possibly heroic Bell<br />

<br />
OT: fucks sake fucking tank rings having fucking strength jesus fuck<br />
<br />
Of course. Because druids dont use normal tank items. You can use agility for tanking stats, no other tanks can now. You will never see a agility/dodge item come out now because it will be worthless to every class/spec except feral bear druid. Str provides a parry conversion for all other tanks. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
So for spriests/boomkins/ele shams, there are 2 easily obtainable 378 trinkets, a 378 cloak that looks pre-heroic BiS (hit + haste), a 378 belt and TWO 391 rings for all incredibly low prices. 6 amazing epic items all from an easy faction grind? That along with the new easily obtainable epic craftable armor pieces and epic weapons (along with world boe drops) really shows just how far things have gone away from the &quot;epic&quot; feel of epics. <br />
<br />
Oh and I forgot to mention how you can pay a guild to run you in heroic modes from the heroic boss drops to upgrade your gear to 391 items as well. Sure this won't happen a week after the patch is released, but in a month or two, but you know guilds will be rolling in the cash once their core raiders have been equipped.<br />
<br />
L-O-L.<br />
<br />
Which has never happened before? Top guilds were selling t1/t2 in vanilla, SWP items were sold in BC, and ICC was sold in Wrath. Its got nothing to do with ease or difficulty of the items to acquire unless you make it take months to gear up and clear content entirely. 5 weeks after ZA came out on my server the bears were being sold for 10k per by multiple guilds. TK/SSC/BT and Hyjal were all run as gold selling runs by high end guilds where you paid 1-2k per item you wanted (or bidded if multiple wanted it aka GDKP).<br />
<br />
Even already in cata, guilds/groups farm trash for BoE's and GDKP runs go into BoT and BWD regularly so your point is completely moot as its never been a problem previously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hate it when people say this. Obviously the &quot;feeling of taking down a boss&quot; is fun enough in progression terms, but then why would you repeatedly kill a boss? Why do you keep showing up for raids when you've already killed those bosses? Maybe cause you're trying to gear up. <br />
<br />
Also, what people tend to look past when people say &quot;the epic feeling is lost&quot; it's not just *seeing* people walk around in epics, it's the excitement you feel when you do get a new piece in a raid. Like when you have 3 other competitors on some trinket you want in a raid for example, when you see your top roll for that piece you've been wanting for weeks, you get a feeling that all your time spent helping out your guild/wiping/farming/putting in raids hours has paid off.<br />
<br />
There's not a single prson out there upon getting the winning roll on a piece of gear they want that doesn't feel some sort of happiness, so don't try and give me this &quot;I don't raid for gear&quot; crap.<br />
<br />
<br />
That is raid rep ala ICC rep, BT rep, etc.<br />
<br />
It probably WONT be fast and who knows, maybe revered &gt; exalted wont even be awarded from trash and possibly even from normal mode bosses.<br />
<br />
Oh and those two trinkets? Suck. From ele PoV, Volcano &gt;&gt; both by large margin and even normal Theralion would be better than the crit one and probably on par with the spirit one... depending on how spirit heavy will be the rest of the 4.2 gear, because honestly, even in 359 gear, you have so much spirit you actually reforge out of it anyway. Heroic Theralion is just flat out better. Even possibly heroic Bell<br />
<br />
For the &quot;easy &lt;faction&gt; grind&quot; you get 365s<br />
<br />
There's no way Volcano will win out vs the spirit one, maybe the crit one, but that spirit + on use: Int will be near, if not the, pre-heroic BiS. Hit is the #1 dps stat obviously followed closyly by haste, reforging that spirit to haste will be incredible, and on use int is amazing for ele shams due to elemental mastery (+ berserking for the troll shams) to be used in conjuction. <br />
<br />
And check it out again, it's not 365 gear, it's all 378 gear according to the post.</div></div><hr />

Why cant quicksilver be healing and viridian dps? Viridian has been used before, and it was for plate dps items. It has been used for healing dragons prior only I believe. <br />

Well of course there were, I remeber nether vortex selling very well for the all-mighty Stormherald. HOWEVER, only a certain number of pieces could be upgraded using them. I believe it was the weapon, boot and a pair of shoulders. In 4.2, EVERY SINGLE VALOR POINT PIECE will be upgraded using the heroic mode drops.

<br />
Instead of raiding for gear, raid for the enjoyment and be happy when gear comes your way. More and more are actually caring more about gear than the enjoyment of raiding. Which leads to burnout, slower progression and less output. People focus so much on their gear that they blame gear for their failures, pass on upgrades because there might be a more 'visible' upgrade on the next boss (Saw someone pass on a trinket to upgrade a blue 346 to 359 perfect stats for class trinket, because they wanted tier shoulders from last boss when they had 353 in indentical stats to tier I believe so was a really minor upgrade - token didnt drop for them and trinket had already been sharded). Items get sharded/given to others and people performance falls behind - which they then blame on gear. Many will also feel entitled to said item when it finally drops and became upset when someone else fairly wins it over them because they 'havent won a thing for weeks'. <br />
<br />
Dont believe me, watch when you raid with PuG's and friends. See how many dont take the first upgrade that drops because they want XX item from the next boss or 5 bosses further in etc. I see it in basically every raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I wasnt talking about upgrading items - crafteds etc. Im talking of the actual drops. Nether vortex were common and easily distributed. Vortexes were only used to upgrade the BS weapons, and craft the new drops. As were the Heart of Darkness from BT/Hyjal (crafting not upgrading) and Sunmotes/Hardened Khorium used for crafting and changing/upgrading in SWP. <br />
<br />
People paying many thousands for drops from other peoples raids was still very common (DST from Gruul was going for 15-20k before SWP came out on my server). These shards are not going to be any different really, you can upgrade 5-6 items max per spec, so 10-20 weeks of farming every heroic mode boss for a 10man raid give or take. By that time everyone is in full heroic loot and bosses on farm will be killed with alts/PuGs paying gold for drops. So instead of getting set drops, they now can sell the shard on top of it. So you can upgrade 4-5 items you need to farm the VP to get in the first place (which with a 980 cap will take you weeks upon weeks of capping out to do) All raids usually give something to upgrade items over what you have. Heroic tier tokens for example. Tier was bought with current currency item then upgraded via a heroic boss drop which could be sold etc once the guild no longer needed them. Heroic drops were used for crafting items etc.<br />
<br />
I think your expecting alot more slots to be filled with VP items over what there actually is. Look at the list, only a few select classes will be using alot of those items over drops, as most will get raid drops in those slots much quicker than buying them. 4 Separate slots*</div></div><hr />

My guess is that it'll proc from melee hits. So you would wanna melee to transform into a fire cat as a hunter.<br />
But maybe it checks for a cat shapeshift on a caster in order to transform him into a fire cat form.</div></div><hr />

Not even really sure if you know what you're arguing here. People who went into a raid not wanting gear, wouldn't give away items because the want another item later on. What you were originally trying to say was that people should &quot;RAID FOR THE FUN OF IT&quot; and the example you've just given shows no evidence to support your theory. I've passed many items on first and second bosses to go for items on later bosses that I would want but I'm still going to the raid to upgrade my gear and chat with the guildies. <br />
<br />
You argument lacks sense.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the first time in AGES that blizz has been willing to give players additional real changes to their look, in a dramatic way, that is specific to certain loot. This should be the norm in a game where you could have so much individuality. Instead, everything looks like everything else.<br />
<br />
Every top-end weapon in this game should have dramatic results for equip, Complete Tier sets as well. Not just fancy shoulders.<br />
<br />
<br />
But anyways, I don't thats the case here. I'm thinking that the staff has a yet-unannounced proc that does the fire kitty thing, but right now its activating constantly and doing the graphical effect..kind of a functional, but bugged item.</div></div><hr />

Raid leader/guild master has to be fair, if both the hunter and druid both have enough DKP, the leader has to followed the rules.<br />

I am also surprised that noone in 6 pages of replies has played on the PTR. The staff, at least until yesterday (Saturday, when last I was on the PTR) had an on use effect that gave you a buff that your cat form is the fire kitty. It has no duration, however the use triggers a two hour cooldown. From the video I would guess that the in combat effect does not require using the &quot;On Use&quot; effect. This On Use effect is also NOT noted in the items stats, so this may all be fluctuating. <br />

That along with the new easily obtainable epic craftable armor pieces and epic weapons (along with world boe drops) really shows just how far things have gone away from the &quot;epic&quot; feel of epics. <br />
<br />
Oh and I forgot to mention how you can pay a guild to run you in heroic modes from the heroic boss drops to upgrade your gear to 391 items as well. Sure this won't happen a week after the patch is released, but in a month or two, but you know guilds will be rolling in the cash once their core raiders have been equipped.<br />

<br />
SSDs certainly offer a performance boost for your OS and some games (including WoW) but they're still in their &quot;infancy&quot; in terms of where the tech is at and the early adoption stage. I was heavily considering ordering one for the computer I built last month but I decided to hold off until the price vs GB vs performance ratios are a bit better, along with reliability. But of course if you have the money to spend, might as well upgrade your storage drive since it can be a good upgrade over a mechanical HDD. I might get one later this year if there's anything good on Black Friday/Cyber Monday or something. :P<br />

People who went into a raid not wanting gear, wouldn't give away items because the want another item later on. What you were originally trying to say was that people should &quot;RAID FOR THE FUN OF IT&quot; and the example you've just given shows no evidence to support your theory. I've passed many items on first and second bosses to go for items on later bosses that I would want but I'm still going to the raid to upgrade my gear and chat with the guildies. <br />
<br />
You argument lacks sense.<br />
<br />
What im saying is, and you have proven the point. You care more about purples and the items, then actually earning/getting them. If everyone did as you did and passed on early boss loot in the hope of getting loot from Cho'gall, how likely would you have killed him as early as you did? Likely you either would not have, or been weeks behind due to average raid gear level being so much lower. Everyone always looks at it as its only 1 item, but 10 people doing it is 10 items, if its 500dps per dps'er then your down 2500 dps in a 10man. Maybe you lose a tank and wipe because the tank is hit harder and the healers did not get as strong a heal of, or OOM'd.Why would you pass on a guaranteed upgrade which will benefit your raid immediately and help you kill more bosses/faster in the hope of an item later on. Im not meaning slight upgrades or sidegrades but pure and simple upgrades. Im not saying your not having fun raiding, merely noting that a certain item (in every case ive seen its usually a highly visible item such as weapon, helm or shoulders) regardless of its equipment value to your class is more important than actually putting in 100% to kill bosses. If your not putting in 100% (which is the case when you pass on upgrades for no reason except wanting possible chance later on at another loot), your not there to progress, only there for your own epics. My reasoning, and you may dissagree, is you are not taking all steps to improve your raids outcomes simply in the interest of your own loot. Maybe your take on raiding is vastly different. But I have fun killing more bosses/harder challenges than farming the same stuff or sitting in SW on my main with epics on. <br />
<br />
I mostly raid on alts, so any loot I get is passed on by mains first. My main, if anything drops I can use as an upgrade in either 3 specs I will take it (offspecs after someone elses mainspec obviously). If that means im waiting months for a drop from Cho or Nef so be it. But falling to 250k wipes etc when you know 2-3 dps have passed upgrades for tier tokens that they then havent gotten is really sad. <br />
<br />
I dont go into raids not wanting loot. I go into raids to raid and simply that. If an item drops I can use to improve my character, I take it and use it (unless its a bigger upgrade to another person). I dont care what my ilvl is, I dont care that I might still have a blue left etc. I care that we kill bosses faster, easier than last week and have fun doing so.</div></div><hr />

So, exactly what kind of things for socials DO you suggest? And how would a social be acquiring the mount0for-socials? Pay 20g and that's it? What exactly is it you want? You refuse to PvE, refuse to PvP (serious enough for the mounts anyway), I really fail to see why you're even playing, I'm a bit confused.

Not to you in specific, but to so called 'casuals' (here defined as a person who says he has no time to play and finds everything too hard to obtain): Sorry that you can't play the content. Maybe this game is not for you after all if you don't have the time for it. Asking to dumb down the game in whatever form or way just to suit your 1 hour a week playstyle is not something I approve of, especially not when you fail to come up with concrete examples of how you envision this.</div></div><hr />

well i can give you my personal background story if you like.<br />
started wow on beta US servers, moved to EU when BC came out raided threw it pvped also (never high end pvp).<br />
my job makes me travel alott and i sleep at the base (im in the navy) so most of the week days i cant raid anymore (used to alott).<br />
i still enjoy pvp a TON and some some heroic dungeons.<br />
got TB dragon mount, so i guess i can farm dont mind it either!<br />
<br />
my main consern is, for this patch atleast they are adding some &quot;fun&quot; factors but those are mainly for semi pvp and semi raiding.<br />
so thats why i posted pvp mount good fun! it really is i love the concept instead of 0.5% of the arena teams get one (which they deserve! dont get me wrong).<br />
but still rated bg's i doubt anybody would take me along for that sinds i mostly only play on the weekends.<br />
<br />
second part raiding... gf again for people who raid and work hard for me but thats my own personal problem that i can't raid (sucks for me)<br />
but there is no in betwine... if you know what i mean? either you DO rated bgs or DO raid! or nothing... (or pay 20 dollars :P)<br />
so my specifik little corner (maybe there are more maybe not) has no option to buy a mount or tradecards.<br />
<br />
<br />
(maybe another tb mount? or more honor mounts?)<br />
more boe world drops good old times?<br />
daily quests rare drops?<br />

Intels SSDs are leagues ahead of everything in terms of reliability and 'safety'.<br />
<br />
When I mean reliability I'm not just referring to breaking or the issue of moving parts vs non-moving parts. It's an issue with longevity and the limited number of read/write (program/erase) cycles that can be done to a SSD vs a HDD and how prone to failure they are, especially after only a year or two of use, again likely due to the write limitations along with other issues, an issue that's not really there for HDDs, I still have HDDs from five to eight years ago (now retired, with a couple likely to be put into external enclosures) that still perform perfectly fine, as it stands now I doubt you could life get the same life span from a SSD you bought today or a year or two ago. Never mind that if your SSD fails you better have regularly back it up because you'll lose everything with no hope of recovery because it will die and most likely do so without any warning. Granted you shouldn't be putting anything other than programs/games onto it (and never any &quot;important&quot; files that are going to be frequently changed) with other files onto a HDD anyway.<br />
<br />
SSDs are getting there and yeah Intel right now is considered the &quot;best&quot; in reliability and seems pretty confident now with their recent warranty increase for some of their SSDs. But SSDs are still &quot;new&quot; and will continue to improve where as HDDs have pretty much reached the end of where they can go. Once the limitations are resolved and the price/GB ratio starts to drop significantly mechanical drives will start being phased out, but we're still a ways away from that happening.<br />
<br />
SSD have one real advantage, it is a big one and that's obviously speed. Yeah, no moving parts and power consumption are advantages too but that's not why people buy them.<br />
<br />
<br />
Do they have to throw crit on every and each damn STR item....<br />

To make up for their throwing Haste on almost every damn STR item in T11 as someone with a Warrior main, I'm pleased about having more options when it comes to Crit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see why they would.<br />
<br />
Every non-transforming class gets to change their look every tier. Cats looked the same as every other cat regardless of gear from T1 - T11... it doesn't exactly make them special to finally get an item that makes them look different.<br />
<br />
To those Druids pointing out that this only looks different in combat... I think the point is to leave the native gear look for major cities and for this look to be more of a while-raiding/PvPing sort of thing.<br />
<br />
But, oh the QQ we'll hear when this staff becomes obsolete and Druids have to leave it behind. Here's hoping that keeping it in inventory will be enough to trigger the effect.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">HatakeSC</div><div class="date">2011-06-13, 10:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really love this idea for the cat staff and honestly something like this should probably be available every tier for the various druid forms just to give them some visual benefit of gaining armor. I would say though that the spell effect of going &quot;firecat&quot; looks a bit odd. It uses the &quot;cloud splash&quot; looking effect that comes down from the sky as part of the Worgen (and perhaps other druid) transforms which make sense when you take a vertical standing creature and convert it from head to toe into another creature. I'm not sure if this was Omen of Clarity procing either but there also seems to be that burst of green at the same time (which clearly describes nature and not fire).<br />
<br />
If I could change anything I would make the fire come from the face of the cat and move backwards along it's body and a similar kind of effect coming out of it. Even just taking the current effect and rotating it would be perfect.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoca371db5304</div><div class="date">2011-06-13, 11:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It's an issue with longevity and the limited number of read/write (program/erase) cycles that can be done to a SSD vs a HDD and how prone to failure they are, especially after only a year or two of use,<br />
The limited number of write cycles is not a concern; barely so for MLC drives (for 24/7 enterprise) - and not at all for SLC drives. You telling me that you expect to write anywhere near 420 terabytes of information on a single 120gb SSD? (Or 1.2 petabyte on older units)<br />
<br />
an issue that's not really there for HDDs, I still have HDDs from five to eight years ago (now retired, with a couple likely to be put into external enclosures) that still perform perfectly fine, as it stands now I doubt you could life get the same life span from a SSD you bought today or a year or two ago.<br />
Sure you can, again - just don't buy OCZ drives. Some 0.5% of intels SSDs have failed three years after the release of the original X25-M; and Kingston is showing no issues either. Compare that to the absolute minimum of 2% for the lower capacity caviar black HDDs in the same period (which is the best HDD in this department), but much worse (up to 10%) for the higher capacities. Added platters absolutely destroys reliability.<br />
<br />
<br />
Never mind that if your SSD fails you better have regularly back it up because you'll lose everything with no hope of recovery because it will die and most likely do so without any warning.<br />
You just described a hard drive, roughly half of the mechanical hard drives that die do so without advance warning. The Sandforce controller is known to die, but that still doesn't kill the data the drive itself stored. That makes it trivial to recover it; which in fact could be done at home with the correct tools, something thats impossible with a HDD (You know why they say never to disect a HDD and expect it to work afterwards?).<br />
Part of the reason why enterprise SSDs sometimes implement hardware level encryption.<br />
<br />
<br />
Granted you shouldn't be putting anything other than programs/games onto it (and never any &quot;important&quot; files that are going to be frequently changed) with other files onto a HDD anyway.<br />
You should not be storing anything of importance on a single drive of any sort, SSD or not. Backups should be obvious, and RAID1, 5, and 10 was devised for a reason; to minimize the impact of the all to regular hard drive failures.</div></div><hr />
