I was under the assumption they just gave her those insane buffs and that was it. Someone else was claiming you have to tank them as well. (Which seems to make the fight outrageous).</div></div><hr />

I like the PvE-nerd vs PvP-guy comparison. You do know that some of the best PvPers happen to also PvE. Either way, this discussion is derailing the thread. ::)<br />

The content is challenging enough for any non-BiS guild (read: Insidia is not one of them) and I think that's where most players are sitting at now.</div></div><hr />

To bad 90% of high-end pvp players do competitively in pve (because its so damn easy) but turn that around and you might meet about 30% of the high end pve people being good in pvp (and about 80% of those are carried by OP pve gear in arena)</div></div><hr />

HAHA. Fake numbers are fake.<br />
<br />
Regardless of what anything thinks, people who DO NOT PvE, should not talk about how easy the fights are. The same way you'd be hard pressed to find someone who isn't 2200+ to talk about being 2200+. Stay in your own kitchen and everyone will have fun with the game.</div></div><hr />

Seeing as the better you react to situations in PVP is also important in PVE. So those top guilds who do really well in PVE like what most of us are now calling SUPER HARDCORE guilds also have very talented PVPers. This ofc is my opinion and I have no basis of fact except common sense.<br />

I do agree with this 100%, I am bad at Arena however do pretty well in World PVP which means absolutely nothing to the majority of players, however I do enjoy World PVP versus organized BG's and Arena's. I love WG when Lag is not killing the mood. It's fun going at it for 5-15 minutes, wish it was longer.</div></div><hr />

In fact, too bad it's the other way around... &quot;90%&quot; of &quot;high-end pvp players&quot; are &quot;high-end&quot; because it takes skill to choose the OP comp of the season and faceroll their OP cooldowns to higher ranking. Gratz, you know how to pick a winning comp.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatelly you can't just pick a DK/Holy Pally combo, faceroll their CDs and clear everything to the last hard mode.<br />
<br />
Unfortunatelly too, for you, probably all REALLY good PvPers came from PvE... I doubt there are more then just a few &quot;PvP only players&quot; on that level.<br />
<br />
btw &quot;carried by OP pve gear in arena&quot;? So, the game turned out to be easy and those skilled guys can't clear Naxx/OS/EoE?!?! Well maybe you meant &quot;bad players carried by their OP comps choices&quot;? You know what? Blizz should just end with this &quot;PvP&quot; gear. They were created because the &quot;skilled PvPers&quot; couldn't kill raid bosses, even with all their awesome skillzz, and they were just destroyed on sight by the ppl who could clear a raid and gear up!<br />

Blizz wanted a competitive 'e-sport' game out of WoW -- so what did they choose?<br />
PvE? No.<br />
PvP? Yes ..<br />

And if you ever played any real game beyond the &quot;world first&quot; nonsense you would know WHY they did this!</div></div><hr />

So you're surprised that the top guilds in the world, who had PTR practise and spend the next few days on WoW clearing content like their life depended on it cleared Ulduar in a few days? <br />

You sir have no idea what are you talking about. When Alganon is dead, then you can say all content is cleared. Because to get to him, you must complete EVERY SINGLE hardmode there is on every other boss. What we have seen this week, is the clear of easy mode.<br />

And in regard to the PvP, aren't most of the best PvP'ers in top PvE guilds?? ;) if you actually checked the rankings for the battlegroups to see who wupped your ass in the arena, for example Meka out of Ensidia so you might know who Im actually talking about :P, 2nd for 2v2 and 1st for 5v5 for the season in BG Conviction and by fuck its the same on Cyclone with the PvE players arena rankings ::). Anyway who cares come on Inner Sanctum for worlds first!! ;D ;D</div></div><hr />

Because you need to kill Iron Council on one of the hard modes for the drop to start the quest, then kill Hodir, Thorim, Freya, and Mimiron on their hardest modes for the quest items. Guilds have done Iron Council, Freya, and Thorim hard modes so far, but they've been different guilds. I don't see any guild doing all 5 hard modes within the first reset, especially since so many of the top guilds have already killed those bosses on easy mode.</div></div><hr />

Now, how long will it be before Blizzard finds a bug in the encounter that trivialized it that should have been found on PTR but wasn't because only the &quot;world first&quot; crowd was there testing to begin with? I'm willing to bet it gets hot fixed early next month. <br />

I would love to be impressed by such garbage but game history has shown that the majority of world first guilds don't do anything honestly.</div></div><hr />

Made my day! Thanks :)<br />

Course if the pvp guy played a REAL game (see WAR) instead of putting up with the overly crappy &quot;pvp&quot; available in this Blizzard train wreck of popularity and marketing then he wouldn't be in the minority fighting against all these pve nerds.</div></div><hr />

However all the fixes do is demand more gear to make it easier. Blizzard dont understand these players want a skill, tactic, synch etc challenge, not one that just requires then to farm easy content for 2 days a week for a while. You will also notice no buffs to easy Yogg, lol, only buffs to hard modes. Hard modes is the real deal.</div></div><hr />

They don't want challenge. They want to put the least amount of effort into stroking their epeens which is why they do it in a video game to begin with. They also notoriously use any cheat they can possibly find and I'm talking about real cheats (walking through walls, safe spots and every other bug) to get those world firsts. Then give Blizzard about 1-2 months to find major glaring bugs that the &quot;world first&quot; crowd guilds ALL used. By that time the world first guilds have their accounts canceled and are waiting to come back to 3.2 and do the pattern again. It has been the same pattern for the last 4 years. This is why when serious MMO players (that don't play Blizzard's test in marketing) look at this game they laugh their asses off at just how popular the game is with just how fail the &quot;community&quot; is.</div></div><hr />

that's not right, it may be the case for some times but generally no. <br />
Davvv is correct up to a point about gear vs challenge and this is a blizzard decision with the general philosophy of the encounters over the years. <br />
Grats to our ex mates btw :)</div></div><hr />

Indeed, sorry Daez, but for 99.9% of cases, thats bullshit, and there certainly is no &quot;pattern&quot; over 4 years, rediculous comment.</div></div><hr />

Actually, I could've easily seen people getting to Algalon on 10man this reset. I'm actually abit surprised none of the guilds that cleared normal 25man quick didn't use their 10man reset to practice hard-modes. Our guild did 10man hard-modes over the weekend when we don't do main raids, and we did council, hodir, thorim and almost freya. If a guild had actually put some real effort into it, they should've been able to get the key. Ofc, it's not 25 man, so it wouldn't &quot;count&quot;. But with the advantage of already being max geared corresponding to the instance the opportunity lies there ready for anyone willing to try.</div></div><hr />

The Encounter was not bugged in anyway and wasn't too easy and you can pretty much ask any of the guilds who didn't rush easymode and actually attempted the watcher hardmodes.<br />
<br />
Only reason they buffed the encounters is because they didn't expect guilds to walk in with naxx gear and kill these bosses on hardmode so they buffed them in a way that doesn't change the fight but makes it require slightly higher item level then is possible to obtain when 1st reaching them.<br />
<br />
You will see next reset if they are still possible or not but even if they aren't that has nothing to do with a fix to the fight or a major buff to the encounter as nothing changed except the fact people wont have the health pools or dps required without gear upgrades but the fight will work the same way.</div></div><hr />
