Mogu'shan Vaults Raid Preview<br />
Today we have an updated preview of the Mogu'shan Vaults raid! If you don't remember what the raid zone looks like, you can take a look at our very early preview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2708-Raid-Sneak-Peek-Mogu-shan-Vaults-Heart-of-Fear-Terrace-of-Endless-Spring). Keep in mind that the zone was very unfinished at that time and that does not represent the final area. You can find these pages in the menu at the right of the navbar in the future. <br />

Tiller's Daily Quest<br />
We are also taking a look at one of the new daily quests that you do for the Tiller's faction (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2865-The-Tillers-Overview-Beta-Class-Balance-Blue-Posts-Raid-Testing-The-Daily-Blink). The Water, Water Everywhere (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/30317) quest asks you to fly around the Heartland and water dusty spots in the crops. You can unlock a kite that flies much faster and a kite that flies higher later on. <br />
<br />
One extra source of rep we didn't mention in the original preview is harvesting crops! Each plant you harvest (http://www.wowdb.com/factions/1272-the-tillers#related:awarded-from) will give you 49 Tillers reputation.<br />

MMO-Champion Forums Moderator Recruitment<br />
Good news everyone! We're recruiting moderators for the forums again! The amount of users and posts keeps increasing and we reached the point where we need some help before the trolls take over and play Whack-a-Mod in the Darkmoon Faire. I know it sounds fun, but I'm going to assume we don't want that. <br />
<br />
This time around we are mostly looking for mods for the class forums as things to start to ramp up for Mists of Pandaria. Exceptional people are always encouraged to apply though! Please be sure to read the entire post before applying.<br />
<br />

Darkmoon Faire Quest Reset Issue<br />
We are aware of an issue in which the Darkmoon Faire quests did not reset properly. We are currently working on a hotfix that we will apply to all realms as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience.<br />

Transmutation Mastery Change<br />
The profession has been changed (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/29482) to prepare for the upcoming expansion and will now require the higher grade material (http://www.wowdb.com/items/72104-living-steel) in order to complete the quests. (Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/5208543136?page=1#11))<br />
<br />
Class Complexity<br />
You have to consider that WoW is a multiplayer game in which players are very often competing, whether comparing damage meters in a raid or out and out trying to kill each other in PvP. Changes to your your character end up affecting everyone who comes into contact with your character. If you can order up exactly what you want, you're affecting a bunch of other people.<br />
<br />
In your hamburger analogy, you're telling the restaurant &quot;You should make sure that nobody can have mayonnaise because I don't like it.&quot; <br />
<br />
I've actually used the restaurant analogy myself, because few restaurant patrons have the impression that they're going to be able to go back into the kitchen, give the chefs pointers, rearrange the menu and so on just because they think highly of their own opinions on food. Restaurants may honor your request to hold the salt or put the dressing on the side, and many chefs are probably thrilled to get feedback on the dishes they prepare to get an idea of what their customers like or not, but ultimately if you don't like a restaurant's food, you should probably go to another restaurant, not try and change the menu.<br />
<br />
As far as class complexity, that's another attempt to serve a very diverse player base. Some players like a few buttons and some like to have a lot. If the restaurant required every dish to have the same number of ingredients, that doesn't improve the quality of the food. I only think it's a problem if some classes are so much more challenging to play that those players expect to do higher DPS as a result, or I guess if the number of buttons is truly stupid.<br />
<br />
Also, remember that there is a huge difference between reasonable and optional. If adding an ability to your rotation improves your DPS by 1% then it might not be worth worrying about. I actually wish guides would focus a little more on describing both the &quot;90% rotation&quot; as well as the &quot;theoretically highest rotation.&quot; (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/233986-cheese-burger-delima-how-players-see-devs/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6471448144?page=1#14))<br />

Second Wind and Healing Nerf<br />
We applied a healing nerf to Arenas and BGs because it was getting impossible to kill anyone. We hope this is just a temporary 85 measure. <br />
<br />
Based on some of these reports, it sounds like percentage heals like Second Wind were affected. They probably shouldn't be. Percentage heals aren't boosted by PvP Power, so they shouldn't be nerfed by the blanket PvP healing debuff. We'll discuss and likely fix it.<br />
<br />
Our stance on Second Wind hasn't changed. Under some circumstances, especially duels, it can account for a tremendous percentage of your health healed, but usually in group PvP (where we spend far more balance emphasis) you're unlikely to stay below 30% health for very long -- you'll either be healed up or killed.

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
Hard drive prices are stagnant and still above the pre-flood prices, so now is still a good time to buy a SSD. The current SSD prices (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2012/september/ssdgraph.gif) seem to have bottomed out for now, with almost all SSDs under $1 per gigabyte. A few sales have even gone under 50 cents per gigabyte, so look for something on sale!<br />
<br />
Unless you are doing a lot of video rendering or something that is similarly multithreaded, you do not need the 3770K and should spend that money elsewhere.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />
<br />
Don't hesitate to post any feedback in the comments of that news post, and don't forget to visit the Computer Forum (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/290-Computer) for any extra questions or help getting an even better deal!

Mists of Pandaria Almost Never Was<br />
The Verge (http://www.theverge.com/gaming/2012/8/15/3244037/world-of-warcraft-mists-of-pandaria-very-nearly-never-was) had an interesting short piece back during Gamescom that is worth a read.<br />
<br />
<br />
A different expansion was pitched, accepted, and background work and lore was started on.<br />
The team then changed direction to Mists of Pandaria when everyone agreed that it felt right. <br />
This expansion goes back to World of Warcraft's roots more so than any expansion before it, thanks to the sense of exploring an entirely new area.<br />
Mists of Pandaria has something that wasn't in the original lore and is more about discovery than previous expansions. <br />

Incoming resurgence of people complaining about MoP...<br />

<br />
Anyway, I'm interested in what this expansion could have been. Seeing as they did some work on it, perhaps they'll choose it as the next expansion, and roll it out sooner. The most obvious avenue would be either emerald dream/Queen Azshara or Burning Legion.</div></div><hr />

It just lets you use a few less keys before ghosting happens. Take a look through the Mechanical Keyboard Guide (http://www.overclock.net/t/491752/mechanical-keyboard-guide) before you buy and make sure it is what you want. Maybe look around the computer forum. There are other options to consider if you aren't sure.</div></div><hr />

Chaud,<br />
<br />
I see in your Peripherals/Monitors list you have Keyboards, Mice, Monitors and Speakers, Have you considered added a head set/microphone section?<br />
<br />
There are many people like myself and my Girlfriend who prefer to use &quot;Headsets&quot; rather than speakers, having 2 speakers going in a room wile we are both raiding or doing different dungeons can cause a lot of issues. And i think most people will agree that a good headset can me as important as a good speaker/sound system. <br />
<br />
I picked up the Logitec G35 (75$) for my girlfriend a about a month ago and we loved it so much I went out and got us both the G930 (Wireless Version) it. It is a bit on the expensive side at 110$ but with 10 hours of wireless talk time, the ability to put Push-To-Talk and Private Ventrilo Key-binds on the wireless headsets G-keys. It allows me to get up get a drink, move around and still respond to chat is well worth every penny.<br />
<br />
I have to say the sound quality is just amazing compared to many of the other headsets I have owned (Playtronics/Creative/Razer).<br />
<br />
Also the Mic-boom has a MUTE indicator (red led) build in to it so you can see if your MIC is hardware muted. It also automatically mutes the Mic if you fold the mic-boom up.</div></div><hr />

They have been working on the pandas since TBC - they were supposed to be the new Alliance race but Draenei were substituted at the last minute. They continued to work on them while doing the other expacs. But I also wonder what they had in mind. They are probably still working on whatever it is for the next expac.<br />

People who played Warcraft III explored parts of Northrend.<br />
<br />
Thanks. I only got into the game shortly before WOTLK.</div></div><hr />

Really, let's just inject some Asia into WoW, casters can run around in cheongsams, and add fat pandas. Did I sum it all up? Please tell me if I'm missing something.</div></div><hr />

I see in your Peripherals/Monitors list you have Keyboards, Mice, Monitors and Speakers, Have you considered added a head set/microphone section?<br />
<br />
There are many people like myself and my Girlfriend who prefer to use &quot;Headsets&quot; rather than speakers, having 2 speakers going in a room wile we are both raiding or doing different dungeons can cause a lot of issues. And i think most people will agree that a good headset can me as important as a good speaker/sound system. <br />
<br />
Nope, I already hesitate with including some of the things in that section. I don't have enough experience with higher end headsets to be confident in recommending something, and there are a lot of bad cheaper headsets. I don't have the time currently to catch up on it, but I would like to expand to include a larger selection of cases and maybe some more peripherals in the future.</div></div><hr />

Wasn't given enough time? From what I've heard from the vast, vast majority of people playing the beta, they love it. Seeing as that's the content they've BEEN working on, it doesn't seem that it didn't &quot;not receive enough attention&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Soeroah</div><div class="date">2012-09-03, 02:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I for one love the idea of exploring an entirely new continent. Probably wouldn't have cared if it was some other new continent, but I'm glad they are expanding on what little we know about the Pandaren. It was always a little odd to have Chen help found Orgrimmar along with Rexxar and then mostly ignore his existance while Rexxar got involved in a small number of quests and rediscovered his race.<br />

<br />
And, given that Blizzard mentioned they were basically planning 'Cataclysm's successor' back when Cataclysm was first announced, it's very likely the 'initial planning and background lore' stage of development was little more than a page of concepts they decided to change long before ever making a new model or landscape.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Althestane</div><div class="date">2012-09-03, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Three things:<br />
1 - awwww,Lei Shi looks so sad! I haven't done much in the way of raiding, but that encounter sounds like an interesting one - a boss who's scared of you. Has something like it been done before?<br />
2 - If they're going for a &quot;back to it's roots&quot; feel with MoP, with exploration and all that, then they've really got to cut back on the scripted storytelling. Cata often felt like a story that was already written and that my character was just a 'generic hero' inserted to move the narrative along. There's a time and place for all that phasing and funneling, but I hope they don't overdo it in MoP.<br />
3 - that 'lock art is really distinctive and wonderful. I'd like to see more artists take on WoW with differing styles.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Obviously they're not saying because they're not gonna start hyping for another expansion that very well might be made in the future before this one is even out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rioo</div><div class="date">2012-09-03, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Maybe they realized that they can milk WoW some more before giving us the Burning Legion expansion a lot of us have been waiting on since TBC/WotLK. It's funny though, they said Cataclysm was supposed to go back to the roots with 1-60 zones, the Twilight Cult and black dragonflight returning, and then that the expansion would be a lot about PvP. Mist feels pretty much like attempt two, and they haven't exactly gotten better at developing the game since, just worse somehow.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmocac96309fe0</div><div class="date">2012-09-03, 06:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Also, remember that there is a huge difference between reasonable and optional. If adding an ability to your rotation improves your DPS by 1% then it might not be worth worrying about. I actually wish guides would focus a little more on describing both the &quot;90% rotation&quot; as well as the &quot;theoretically highest rotation.&quot; <br />
<br />
That would all fine and dandy if it were not for a fact that there exists something like PQR which throws your &quot;90% rotation&quot; out of equation and leaves everyone with the ability to execute perfect rotations without a slighest effort. Unless they fix that, all this speech of complex/optional rotations is nothing more than hoarse shit in which cheaters win and legitimate players suffer.<br />
<br />
And yes I will mention that thing's name in order raise awarness about it in order to force blizzard to finally break it.</div></div><hr />

Incoming resurgence of people complaining about MoP...<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, I'm interested in what this expansion could have been. Seeing as they did some work on it, perhaps they'll choose it as the next expansion, and roll it out sooner. The most obvious avenue would be either emerald dream/Queen Azshara or Burning Legion.<br />
<br />
I think popular opinion held that it was Emerald Dream.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except that since the Stormrage novel there are only small pockets of Nightmare left.<br />
Not to mention Malfurion got enough screentime in Cataclysm anyways (Darkshore quest, Mt Hyjal quests including fighting against Ragnaros, Molten Front stuff, HC Ragnaros fight).</div></div><hr />

It should be fine, provided you aren't expecting max settings on a high resolution. A mix of medium and high depending on the game should be nice and smooth.</div></div><hr />
