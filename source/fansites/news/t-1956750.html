Legion - The Arcway Dungeon<br />
The Arcway is a new dungeon added in Legion, originally referred to as Suramar Catacombs.<br />

Legion - Nightborne Citizens<br />
In addition to the Nightborne (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4frZiYX-II), Nightfallen (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i933nMLZKI), and Withered (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_i933nMLZKI) models we have looked at in the past, a recent Legion build added Nightborne Citizen models.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
PvP<br />
With a revived tournament scene like and all of the PvP specific changes coming in Legion, I see a great future for our community. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/701521803827490816))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
If a creature is from, relating to, or characteristic of, demons, it can be considered demonic. So why are people pretending as if Deathwing isn't demonic?<br />
what about an earth aspect maddened by old gods is related to demons? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700855904741142529))<br />
but he wasn't corrupted by the demon, and the demon didn't even want to be inside of it, it was TERRIFIED of being shoved in there (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700858441011572736))<br />
because what was really at its heart was an Old God (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/700858487266390016))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Mimiron is such a cool boss on hard mode<br />
Mimiron was awesome. But his red button was a little tongue in cheek and I think a literal button gets silly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700148261487644673))<br />
<br />
It was insulting!<br />
I was attempting to explain the developer intent for the direction of dungeons. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700118678470176768))<br />
Specifically, that using a full action bar and relying on teammates makes the stakes higher and the accomplishment more rewarding (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700118847693533184))<br />
It's fine if you don't like that direction and want something else. You shouldn't feel insulted for that. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700118994540318720))<br />
<br />
I still don't get why LFR has to be so toothless. FFXIV duty finder is a tad harder and still works.<br />
When LFR was harder, it was a miserable experience. Folks would just wipe and bail. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700198051357437953))<br />
In ancient WoW you could rejoin the same AV that you'd dropped 4 hours ago. Early LFR was almost that (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700198453591158784))<br />
<br />
because people struggle at work all day. The last thing they want from their escapism is more struggle<br />
I don't think that's universally true. A lot of hobbies are compelling because of the challenge: golf, hunting, marathons... (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700199202429624320))<br />
Maybe plopping in front of the TV isn't challenging, but that's also not really a game. WoW is intended to be a game, not TV (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700199453278343168))<br />
I get that maybe not everyone wants soul-crushing frustration, but we're still just talking about 5 player dungeons here. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700199651576709121))<br />
<br />
do you think engineers get enough limelight in the games profession?<br />
No, I don't. Sometimes their work is challenging to explain to players. Other times if it just works, you don't notice. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/700361588226719746))<br />

Illidan is half night elf and respects the blood elves, the choices they made fit perfectly for demon hunter races, plus nightborne are just filthy Drow!</div></div><hr />

<br />
All player armor has to also stretch nicely across 26 models, and otherwise redesigned for male and female, as they often have big differences.<br />
<br />
There's a big difference between making one static piece that works well on one race versus doing the above.<br />
<br />
A game like, say, ESO doesn't have to worry about this because all their armor is designed for two skeletons--male and female--with the only exception being tales, which just clip through. Belf armor to tauren? Undead to gnome? Yeah.<br />
<br />
THAT SAID, I would very much like more innovation for armor--especially chest pieces. Maybe a little less effort on shoulders one tier and more effort on chest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Conspiracy theory here. Someone at Blizzard wanted to move one of their characters all their 250k gold.. so they bumped it up to let them.. Now there is an issue with it!! Turn it back down... DUNDUNDUDN.... Tin foil hating!!!<br />
<br />
I wish I knew more about graphic design to talk about it. Something just seems not right.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Parts of those look cool, at least they seem to be breathing and don't sway like drunks anymore. Also their faces look agreeable. The only thing I find weird is the positioning of the arms. I think they look silly on the females, lifeless, like a doll's, I'd love to have these new models with the animation of the old night <br />
elve females (maybe with a little less mouth breathing)...<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Indeed. Current nelf female models look like shit when compared to those nightborne ones.<br />
<br />
Especially since you are unable to use the old models on nelfs in alpha, I wonder if it stays that way (I hope not though).</div></div><hr />

He was expecting Blizz to transition from alpha to beta after the new year so he had his artist use beta in all the artwork. When Blizz kept the alpha tag he decided he wasn't going to change the already made graphics up.</div></div><hr />
