<br />
I would agree that Freya is definately the last watcher I would keep up. Completing the fight without being able to refresh sanity seems hard. Nigh impossible at this stage. The DPS must be insane on the inside, and probably not possible with current gear standards.<br />
<br />
I'd probably keep Hodir as my second last over Thorim tbh. He's just handy to have, just in case. :)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zinge</div><div class="date">2009-04-30, 12:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im pretty sure that with Freya not up, there are just less sanity beams. And Thorim kills the immortal guys in phase 3, guess you didnt know that. Hes way more valuable than Hodir.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ramsamsam</div><div class="date">2009-04-30, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">ye they stay at 1 hp without thorim<br />
but<br />
they don't deal any serious damage when they are at 1 hp since they lose all their stacks of their dmg buff, so it's easy to tank them through. probably want 3 tanks instead of 2, though, just in case.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Unless you're going for the realm first title of &quot;Death's Demise&quot; there's no real reason to do Yogg-Saron with 0 Keepers considering Heroic: Glory of the Ulduar Raider has the 1 Keeper achievement as part of the meta.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, the problem is they have a lifedrain so you would need kicking for every mob.<br />
Further does yogg cast a heal when more than 2 are up at the same time. Those heals will increase the damage of the mobs again and also heals yogg.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DUnno about you , but i havent refilled sanity when i did Yogg.. cant imagine THAT would make it so much harder.<br />
Thorim kill the mobs in P3 and gives 2 nice buffs , i would leave him up if i went for 1 watcher now :P</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Shikari</div><div class="date">2009-04-30, 09:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">P3 Add's Life Leech isn't really a problem (Hi, skilled FoK anyone?). The only real problem in P3 is the Empowering Shadows (Yogg's &quot;Heal&quot;) which isn't interruptable but is being cast on, I think, 2 (non Heroic) and 3-4 (Heroic) Adds which must be taunted outside the bunch of mobs and Yogg-Saron (At least that's how we tried to deal with them) so they can't heal anyone (It's a HoT which heals every mob near the mob, I think). With about 20-30 adds up, I think it becomes next to impossible to drag the right adds (They spawn about every 10 seconds in Heroic)<br />
<br />
You don't need Hodir if you watch your steps and the tanks are quick<br />
You don't need Mimiron if you have enough dispellers<br />
You might not need Freya if you watch the Malady perfectly and have no bad luck in Psychosis-casts (Last time I went from 100 Sanity to 16 Sanity in about 1 minute because Sara has cast Psychosis 7 times on me &lt;,&lt;)<br />
<br />
Thorim seems the most reasonable one for me since the P3 Adds are quite a pita</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Since one of their members confirmed my assumption that they used mimiron via IRC, I think you're not right.<br />
<br />
Mimiron seems to be the best keeper for 1 light anyways, since he takes care of several tentacles, with the current gear, I just can't imagine how it should be possible to kill them all prior to phase 3. During Phase 3, youll have to bring those guardians down to 1% as fast as possible, as theyre only a threat when at high HP.</div></div><hr />
