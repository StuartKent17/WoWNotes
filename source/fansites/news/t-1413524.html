Warcraft Movie Cast Announcement<br />
Legendary (http://variety.com/2013/film/news/ben-foster-warcraft-rob-kazinsky-1200805271/) announced that Ben Foster (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004936/), Toby Kebbell (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1527905/) and Rob Kazinsky (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2059117/) will have lead roles in &quot;Warcraft&quot;, with Dominic Cooper (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1002641/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1) in negotiations for a part as well. Filming will take place in Vancouver, starting in January 2014. It looks like (https://twitter.com/RobertKazinsky/status/408402649684275200) Kazinsky is a fairly active player, with five level 90 characters!<br />

Patch 5.4.2 PTR - Build 17645<br />
Another tiny PTR patch tonight, with another Karazhan name change, courtesy of Dave Maldonado (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo).<br />
<br />
Phase #2801 - Karazhan 2: Eclectic Boogaloo has been renamed to Medivh Presents Chessmaster: Illustrious Edition.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 5.4.2 PTR Patch Notes - December 2<br />
Patch 5.4.2 is now available for testing on the Public Test Realms (PTR)! Participating on the Public Test Realms lets you test patches before it has been released.<br />
<br />
If you'd like to help test and provide feedback, you can start by copying your character and downloading the PTR client. Once you've had a chance to try things out, be sure to visit our PTR Discussion forum to discuss the patch, and the PTR Bug Report forum to report any issues or errors.<br />

General<br />
<br />
Intervene no longer removes movement-impairing effects on use. The talent Safeguard will continue to remove movement-impairing effects.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Cross-Realm raid browser now has new categories for Mists of Pandaria World Bosses (Celestials and Ordos) and Flexible raid difficulty for Siege of Orgrimmar.<br />
<br />
The cross-realm raid browser is accessed through the 'Social Pane' (bound to the O key by default) and look for the 'Raid' tab on the bottom right.<br />
From there you can set the character as looking to join a raid or browse players that are forming up for a raid.<br />
For more information on this change, please see the thread titled Cross-Realm Raid Browser on the PTR Discussion forum.<br />
<br />
Players are now able to place raid markers in the world even while dead.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Players are now able to mail account-bound items to other characters that reside on a different realm on the same account. To send cross-realm mail: enter the character's name, followed by a hyphen &quot;-&quot;, followed by the realm name. Note that cross-realm mail can only send account-bound items, not other items or gold.<br />
<br />
Additional information and testing discussion for this cross-realm mail can be found in this thread on the PTR Discussion forum.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
UI<br />
<br />
The Customer Support button has moved. Customer support can now be reached in-game by selecting Help option through the Game Menu (Game Menu is bound to the Escape key by default).<br />

Developer Communication<br />
We try to communicate as much as we can. I can't speak for every CM (as we all have different duties around the office which can often take us away from the forums a bit), but conversing on the forums has been a personal priority of mine since I started here. I spend a large chunk of my day reading and replying when I feel I have something meaningful to add. I also collect a ton of feedback to bring directly to the developers for discussion.<br />
<br />
I totally get the concerns about losing Ghostcrawler from Twitter. He's been one of the most candid and open developers in the gaming industry as a whole for a long time. Fortunately, he's not only developer responding regularly on Twitter! We actually have a list in one of the stickies on this forum with Twitter handles of several top developers. Generally speaking, any question you would previously have sent to Ghostcrawler, someone else on that list will be able to answer. The Community team's Twitter handles are listed in there as well.<br />
<br />
Greg will no longer be working with us here at Blizzard, but we're not going to let that be a stopping point to our interaction with the community. We're here for you guys.<br />
<br />
Are you serious? You actually think what you say and them saying &quot;oh we'll look into it&quot; matters at all? Here's a quote from Holinka an hour ago <br />
While I acknowledge that tweet could have been phrased better, that was an out of context response to a conversation. I won't presume to speak for Brian, but according to my interpretation and within the context of that conversation, I think what he's trying to get across (within the limitations of Twitter) is that we make changes based on a perceived need, not merely because a volume of ideas for changes exist.<br />
<br />
We say 'we'll look into it' all the time. I've said it many times myself, on a variety of topics, and it does alert us to situations where a change or adjustment is merited. If you don't believe that what the community has to say has an impact? Well, evidence of the opposite is all around you.<br />
<br />
Making 90s out of those of my numerous alts who aren't there yet. 11th one last Saturday; 12th one &quot;soon&quot; <br />
I plan to use my boost to play with opposite faction pals on a realm where my leveled characters are all one faction. Lookin' forward to it!

Blue Tweets<br />
Warlords of Draenor Items<br />
The new item system (stats prop. for your spec) will affect all items (neck, ring...) or just the set (chest, helm..)?<br />
Only the main armor pieces (head etc.) will swap primary stats. That is true of tier sets and off-piece items. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403319331347394561))<br />
Jewelry etc. likely won't ever have primary stats. They may have attack power, but mostly secondary stats. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/403319525828857856))<br />
<br />
This isnt going to help as much as you think, just make things more annoying for players.<br />
We feel acquiring BiS quickly only feels good for the short term. Long term it has little staying power. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402656752555929600))<br />
Imagine killing Immerseus 16 times and sharding everything while you're still farming Garrosh. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402656895535558656))<br />
Then imagine every Immerseus kill you still pay attention to loot because something cool or amazing could drop. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402657016864182272))<br />
<br />
Not sure how this erases the issues spec-based primary stats were supposed to fix. Why not spirit/armor on primary?<br />
Because then you can't choose how much you want. You just get what we give you. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402648643603165184))<br />
That's the design for primaries to keep them growing with ilevel. Secondaries are about what stats you like. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402648787706839040))<br />
If you heal, you may want Spirit on every non-armor spot or not. You may find those pieces or not. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402648949426630657))<br />
<br />
RE: removing hit/exp - does that mean all attacks 100% hit? Or is there a baseline miss chance we can no longer negate?<br />
Imagine you capped yellow attacks, which is typical today. Melee might miss from the front or with an OH attack. (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402544056577703936))<br />
I don't like removing them for two reasons. 1) historical. Craps on combat table. 2) I have 3 stats left. Yawn?<br />
Hopefully not 3 stats... (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402655075115339776))<br />
<br />
with reforge gone how are we going to deal with haste break points? Just curious<br />
Our dot/hot changes mean fewer haste break points. Usually more haste is still valuable after break, just less valuable than before (Source (https://twitter.com/Ghostcrawler/status/402654717127294976))<br />

Addon Update - WeakAuras 2<br />
There is an exploit that causes players to give away their gold via a malicious WeakAuras script being imported. To protect yourself, please update your copy of WeakAuras to the latest version, which protects against some attacks. Also avoid importing any scripts from untrustworthy sources, as attacks are still possible.<br />

I can't tell if you're being sarcastic :P. It's set back in the good ole Orcs vs Humans days. That's what I got out of it at least.<br />

Yeah I had to google all of the actors but just because I don't associate actor names and faces. Actually recognized at least half of them. Looks like it will be interesting.<br />

Also pretty excellent that Robert Kazinsky is a super active WoW player. He tweeted his /played if you follow the links... it's pretty impressive. Like depressingly so. <br />

Archangel wasn't very memorable in that, it was a sideplot in X3 that didn't connect to the main plot. And X3 sucked. So you could easily miss him.<br />

It's called keeping the public in the dark (or guessing). You can't derive ANYTHING from that name as it keeps changing each build.

Legendary announced that Ben Foster, Toby Kebbell and Rob Kazinsky will have lead roles in &quot;Warcraft&quot;, with Dominic Cooper in negotiations for a part as well. Filming will take place in Vancouver, starting in January 2014. It looks like Kazinsky is a fairly active player, with five level 90 characters!<br />
<br />
And Paula Patton (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1745736/). You forgot Paula Patton, despite her name being listed in the tweet. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're not going to see it anytime soon, because that's because it's not Blizzard's oQueue.<br />
<br />
There is a long-existing LFR tool in the game right now. It was put in probably... in WotLK? There was even a blue post about this 1-2 weeks ago. The CM joked, &quot;Yeah, I had forgotten about it too&quot;. You could probably even see it in MMO-C's news archive for the last few weeks if you're willing to pick through the posts.<br />
<br />
Anywho, the thing only works for your home server, and isn't automated. If you want to see it now, open your Social window, click on the bottom &quot;Raid&quot; tab and click on the &quot;Other Raids&quot; button at the top of that tab. It's kinda boring and useless.<br />
<br />
Anyways, be sure to thank your local addon-authors for inspiring Blizzard staff to actually push their baseline UI functions further.</div></div><hr />

He was the main bad guy in 3:10 to Yuma - he was Russell Crowe's right-hand man who spends most the film trying to catch up with him and Christian Bale to free his gang leader. He was a creepy badass in that movie; 3:10 to Yuma was an extremely good movie.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think what they meant wasn't necessarily that neither side would antagonize, just that both sides would relate. The first thing I thought of when they said it was We Were Soldiers. If you haven't seen it, I recommend it. It's one battle in Vietnam, but they do show more of both sides. The vietnamese aren't just living equivalents of zombies for a war movie, but you see humanity in them. There are a few other movies whose names I'm blanking on at the moment, but it's something about letters written home from both sides, WW II iirc. No good guy or bad guy means you understand both sides. At least, that's what I really hope.</div></div><hr />

Will the other options be cheaper than the &quot;all access&quot; one and you can save money for not having to pay for stuff you are not interested in (like I don't care about &quot;eSports&quot;) or will everthing be the same price but you just get less out of your bucks if they decide against &quot;all access&quot;?

Ive been to the last 2 blizzcons, and while i'm not supper interested in the esports, its cool to watch a match or 2 in some of the down time or on the screens while in line. I will say, that some times it could get quite loud from the group or announcers though, with out even being that close to the event stage. For instance, we were waiting for a raffle announcement when the SC finals ended, and the music and announcer was so loud, you could not hear the person on a loud speaker 20 feet in front of us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is, they made a really half assed attempt for pre 6.0.<br />
<br />
It's basically just adding the flex/ordos/celestials to the already (extremely hidden) raid browser interface, which has no automation at all, it just a simple list where you can list your name, it has never worked in practice in all the time its been there.<br />
<br />
You can see a screenshot here:<br />
wow .joystiq. com/2013/11/21/patch-5-4-2-blizzards-answer-to-oqueue-enters-testing<br />
<br />
It literally does nothing that the oqueue addon does, you can't set ilvl requirements, you can't do custom grps, you can't easily invite people etc.<br />
<br />
As a raid leader you literally have _no_ idea about the people being in the list, they could all be freshly dinged 90's in even pre timeless free epic gear.<br />
<br />
I would much rather they provided a proper API for addons to talk to people/addons cross realm, so it doesn't require adding battlenet friends to get it working.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Considering how enormous and well known the source material is (find anyone under 25 who knows what a computer is that doesn't have some kind of experience with warcraft in some form. You can't.), and Legendarys reputation, and Blizzards reputation for that matter... I think it's safe to assume that they know what they're doing and they're being very careful about doing it. This isn't some small studio doing another awful game-movie adaptation. However you feel about Blizzard as a company, they are one of the, if not THE, finest gamesmiths in the industry and they DEMAND quality, working with one of the finest film companies in the industry. Have a little faith that they won't release something that sucks.</div></div><hr />

Lol you actually fell for their trolling..they couldn't make it any more obvious if they tried (and they are trying). They're just messing with people.

Doubt most kids of that age bother with wow forums. And tbh i don't care for true blood actors or anyone linked with it, shitty tv series through and through. Aimed for teenage girls with unrealistic views of the world, same as twilight. there ya go =)</div></div><hr />

I'm glad they don't have any huge stars like Clooney. I always like movies better when I can really get into the characters, and it's hard when you've seen someone 100000000 times in something.<br />
<br />
That being said... where are the women??? You can't tell me there's no Tyrande, or Sylvanas.... I really hope Blizz doesn't turn this movie into a sausage fest where the only female characters are just pretty to look at. Warcraft has some seriously badass women that would be fantastic lead characters. I'm interested to see how this develops.</div></div><hr />

Ben Foster is amazing in &quot;3:10 to Yuma&quot; and &quot;The Mechanic.&quot; I recognize Rob Kazinsky from the most recent season of &quot;True Blood&quot; in which he wasn't horrible. He was also in &quot;Pacific Rim,&quot; which overall, could have been better on the acting...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think that had more to do with the writing than his acting. It was a movie filled with over the top characters, while I didn't care for him he was better and more interesting than the lead. I don't remember foster from Yuma and I haven't seen any of those others. Dominic Cooper was actually the one guy I recognized. He was the best part of &quot;Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter&quot; which was a forgettable movie and he did a good job as Howard Stark in &quot;Cpt America&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christoper Lee, John Rhys-Davies, Hugo Weaving were all well known actors before rings. But yeah they did take some new talent and get alot out of it. Best combination is always young new talent combined with experienced talent. They help bring the best out of each other.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't want to see the next Brad Pitt/Angelina Jolie movie that happens to have a famous IP tacked on.<br />
<br />
Remember Tomb Raider?<br />
<br />
How about World War Z (which, while I liked it, had near zero fidelity to the source material).<br />
<br />
How about Doom with The Rock (aka Dwayne Johnson).<br />
<br />
Much better to have a cast of people who can act than to have a bunch of overpaid famous people who have a vision for how the movie should turn out.<br />
<br />
Also, the director seems to respect the wow source material and seems interested in bringing the source material to the screen rather than &quot;re-imagining&quot; it.<br />
<br />
I'm cautiously optimistic. The no-name cast is part of the reason why.</div></div><hr />

Ben Foster tends to play a whiny, spineless crook, so I can only imagine what he will be doing here. He's a pretty awful actor to watch.</div></div><hr />

Well if it is First war era we won't see Blood Elves. But kinda right. With boobs like that she will definitely play High Elf Sylvanas.</div></div><hr />

More like offering a la carte options. I did not once watch any of the e-sports but hearthstone...and that was free. If they charge less if I opt out of that option then I'm all for it</div></div><hr />

Brad Pitt for example, most overrated actor of our time but he does pull audiences, so if they can give him a role like that in Snatch (only Movie I liked him in) it'd be great.</div></div><hr />
