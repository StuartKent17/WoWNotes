Icecrown Citadel Testing - October 15<br />
We are scheduling a raid test for Icecrown Citadel tomorrow at 7pm EDT/4pm PDT for the two US PTR Servers. Lord Marrowgar, the first boss of the raid zone, will be available for testing. The trash leading up to him will also be ready for testing.<br />
<br />
The Icecrown Citadel raid test schedule will be very flexible, and can change at a moment's notice due to build status, bugs, and server issues. Remember that this is the test server, so things can, do, and will break from time to time. Check this forum for the latest US Icecrown Citadel raid testing schedule information in the weeks to come.<br />
<br />
The EU region will have a different raid testing schedule, which I will announce on their forums in the near future as I have further information and more bosses are ready for testing. <br />

Azshara in Cataclysm<br />
When Cataclysm is released, Azshara will finally be a fully quested zone, complete with lore and other coolness. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20464489276-azsharas-history-gone-come-cataclysm.html))<br />

Waiting for battle rez cooldowns in heroic ToC<br />
The main consideration that drove this change was the limited attempts in ToC heroic. It's not fun to feel like you are supposed to sit around and let your long cooldowns come back up. We really like the limited attempts mechanic though and might use it again in the future, so we wanted you to feel like the battle rezes would be reasonably available. Yes if you wipe in 2 min you might not have it available again, but you probably shouldn't be battle rezzing that quickly into a fight anyway.

Scourge Strike on PTRs<br />
1) Scourge Strike should crit for 200% damage like other DK spell effects.<br />
2) The Shadow part of the damage should never miss if the physical part hits.<br />
3) The Shadow part of the damage should never be decreased additionally to the physical damage. It should not &quot;double dip&quot; from resilience et al. Example: My physical portion that hits for 2000 is reduced to 1000. The Shadow part should then hit for 1000 (modulo bonuses) and not 500 or whatever.<br />
4) The Shadow part of the damage will still be increased additionally by talents and anything else that buff Shadow damage. It will &quot;double dip&quot; in the DKs favor. Example: My physical portion hits for 2000 and is reduced to 1000. The Shadow portion hits for 1500 because I have +50% Shadow damage. <br />
<br />
Scourge Strike Damage<br />
Only the physical damage can be reduced. The Shadow damage can only be buffed, since it is essentially already reduced by the physical mitigation, resilience or other defensive effects.<br />
<br />
The intent was just to split the damage into part physical and part Shadow. We didn't want the split itself to be a penalty, if that makes sense. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20433766548-scourge-strike-on-the-ptr--information.html))<br />

Rejuvenation nerf in 3.3<br />
I think our dislike for Rejuv blanketing gets oversold on these forums. We nerfed Rejuv because Rejuv was too good. Druids do have a lot of heals and ideally they would use all of them (and HT proponents even crop up from time to time). On the other hand, it's challenging given that when a relic or set bonus props up one spell, that is probably going to be a popular spell. We're fine with that to some extent. It's interesting when certain pieces or tiers of gear lead you to want to change up which spells you favor.<br />
<br />
We changed Gift of the Earth Mother because it was a problematic talent, as I'm sure many of you could agree. It's one thing when class mechanics make a stat less optimal for you. It's another when a talent totally stomps over a stat that shows up on a lot of gear.<br />
<br />
We want Nourish to be a good spell, yes, but I think it has been for some time. None of these changes will kill Rejuv either. <br />
<br />
[...] To be honest, we may revert the Rejuv nerf. This isn't 100% finalized yet, so please don't say we promised anything.<br />
<br />
We definitely wanted to nerf Rejuv. However we also wanted to fix Gift of the Earth Mother. That change wasn't necessarily aimed at further nerfing druids, even though that was the outcome. It was aimed at not making haste such a wonky stat for Resto.<br />
<br />
In short, we think the GotEM change both nerfed druids and fixed the haste scaling problem so the Rejuv duration nerf may not be necessary. Stay tuned. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20442617121-ptr-build-10571-more-druid-nerfs.html))<br />

Vampiric Embrace as a buff in 3.3<br />
VE is unlikely to work with Mind Sear. Just sayin. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20444817490-shadow-priests--now-best-healers-in-the-game.html))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman<br />
Tier 10 Elemental Relic<br />
The Elemental totem is haste, not crit, and I believe it is a 30 sec duration. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/20444817291-ele-new-totem.html))<br />
<br />
Reincarnation cooldown<br />
We might drop Reincarnation to 30 base, talented to 15. That's a slight nerf to the talent, but at the same time taking the cooldown that low might make an unattractive talent more attractive. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20433765805-why-is-reincarnation-still-50-minutes--lolol.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We were concerned that a really short cooldown on an ability that rezzes you and only rezzes you would lead to bizarre behavior. Shamans could just commit suicide every fight knowing that they could come back. Standing in the fire too long? No problem. Too far away from where you want to be? Just die. Out of mana? Just die. Yes you might lose dps or healing time, but we still think it would happen and we think it would look weird.<br />
<br />
Soulstone by comparison can easily be used on the &quot;wrong&quot; person (if they don't die) and Rebirth can't be used at all if the druid dies. In some ways, Reincarnation is the only cooldown that you are guaranteed to see every fight as soon as it becomes that dependable.

Actually, I think it's more along the lines of &quot;we need these specific bosses player-tested for X reason.&quot; As GC has said, they can theoretically test anything in-house, but it would be entirely predictable. Sometime they need the unpredictability of a player-test.</div></div><hr />

There is a same reward in weekly quest for killing lord marrowgar as for killing patchwerk. So, sadly, it will be exactly the opposite. He will propably serve as an inviotation to icecrown, and all we can hope is that blizzard will raise difficulty during instance so we wont see pugs on LK at the end of icecrown(talking about normal mode..) :)</div></div><hr />

It should be treated the same as a soulstone or battle rez. They get up and get back in action. The out of mana thing, free aggro dump, or excuse for laziness probably won't be worth it in the end. A lot of people, for whatever reason, loathe repair bills. Those are the ones who complain about it, and always announce that shit on vent. Those people will avoid death when possible to prevent an extra 5g to the bill.<br />
<br />
Also, there are people who love buffs and will stop a raid to make sure a resto shaman has might or something dumb. You don't want to lose all buffs when you come back to life.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are more than enough mods out there that check to see who died or what spell is on cooldown. Any decent raid leader can start to see a trend where a shaman dies too often on a fight and gets booted from the raid or even guild.<br />
<br />
Make it a 30 minute cooldown please.<br />
<br />
Better yet, change the talent to allow us to pop back up with more health and mana, and maybe just make the cooldown 5/10 minutes, instead of 7.5/15.</div></div><hr />

It'd take a PUG all week to get to Arthas even if they are decent and well-geared, since their wipe recovery is 30 minutes instead of 3 minutes.<br />

The idea would be that a short enough Reincarnation can be abused to be a threat-wipe or free mana (&quot;oh, I'm out of mana, I'll just stand in the fire, ankh, and now I've got 20%&quot;). Personally, I'm suspicious that people are gonna pay a repair bill to get mana when they have Mana Tide totem or can call for an Innervate, and I've never had threat issues as a DPSing shaman.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ive also not had any serious mana issues as ele nor as resto which is my current main spec. I mean sure you may be able to get mana but the poster who i quoted forgets that for it to be even as effective as you have mentioned is that you need to spec into it(which is weird as the talent has NO secondary benefits) AND be in a bad pug in which your gonna be running out of mana.I deally i believe blizz planned for us to be able to finish raid encounters fine without having to &quot;die&quot; to get mana.<br />
<br />
Therefore i believe in conclusion , that shammies &quot;dying&quot; to get mana would be in essence just basically loosing out on some benefitial raid buffs for extra mana that was not necessary for em to adequately heal an encounter.</div></div><hr />

Vampiric Embrace as a buff in 3.3<br />

<br />
<br />
As a Shadow Priest, I'm totally cool with this. Currently, you can't really put VE on all the targets that will be affected by Mind Sear, so nixing Mind Sear with the future VE as a buff doesn't take away anything. And, yesterday when I first read the news about VE as a buff, my jaw hit the floor thinking about a SP lighting up PvP or raids with Mind Sear and getting an ungodly amount of healing in return. That would have been crazy OP.</div></div><hr />

It should be treated the same as a soulstone or battle rez. They get up and get back in action. The out of mana thing, free aggro dump, or excuse for laziness probably won't be worth it in the end. A lot of people, for whatever reason, loathe repair bills. Those are the ones who complain about it, and always announce that shit on vent. Those people will avoid death when possible to prevent an extra 5g to the bill.<br />
<br />
Also, there are people who love buffs and will stop a raid to make sure a resto shaman has might or something dumb. You don't want to lose all buffs when you come back to life.<br />
<br />
I'm sure there are more than enough mods out there that check to see who died or what spell is on cooldown. Any decent raid leader can start to see a trend where a shaman dies too often on a fight and gets booted from the raid or even guild.<br />
<br />
Make it a 30 minute cooldown please.<br />
<br />
Better yet, change the talent to allow us to pop back up with more health and mana, and maybe just make the cooldown 5/10 minutes, instead of 7.5/15.<br />
<br />
<br />
The short cooldown presents a balance problem though. You have to balance the fight around the assumption that people will use their abilities intelligently. So any ability on a short cooldown you would have to assume will be used in every fight.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of other options though. They could prevent ressing into combat which would prevent the abilities use in raids almost completely. Alternatively they could impose a wait time after you die before you can res. So if you die you can reincarnate after 30 seconds but not before which would make it quiet difficult to make tactical use of the ability (though I imagine many shammies would QQ at not being able to insta-res + frost shock after they die in pvp).</div></div><hr />

Reincarnation cooldown<br />
We might drop Reincarnation to 30 base, talented to 15. That's a slight nerf to the talent, but at the same time taking the cooldown that low might make an unattractive talent more attractive. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/20433765805-why-is-reincarnation-still-50-minutes--lolol.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We were concerned that a really short cooldown on an ability that rezzes you and only rezzes you would lead to bizarre behavior. Shamans could just commit suicide every fight knowing that they could come back. Standing in the fire too long? No problem. Too far away from where you want to be? Just die. Out of mana? Just die. Yes you might lose dps or healing time, but we still think it would happen and we think it would look weird.<br />
<br />
Soulstone by comparison can easily be used on the &quot;wrong&quot; person (if they don't die) and Rebirth can't be used at all if the druid dies. In some ways, Reincarnation is the only cooldown that you are guaranteed to see every fight as soon as it becomes that dependable.

Deal! I would love to have reincarnation at 30 minute cooldown with specing down to 15 minutes.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully more here :) the thing I hate is, a guild downs a ptr boss then spams vids and tacts all over the place :( ah well...</div></div><hr />

I just reeeaaally wanted to see the screen light up with streaming green numbers with plus signs beside them during an AoE fight. That would just be fantastic. Can we just have a little fun before you nerf it? Aww, I guess not.</div></div><hr />
