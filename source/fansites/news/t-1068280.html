Activision Blizzard Q4 2011 Conference Call<br />
The Q4 2011 Earnings call will take place on February 9, at 1:30 PM PST, which brings us an update on subscriber numbers for the final quarter of 2011. Keep in mind last call informed us of a 800,000 subscribers loss, but this time around the Annual Pass and Patch 4.3 may soften the blow. <br />
<br />
The week of the call also may bring us information on upcoming releases, if there will be any announcement expect it before the call takes place. During the previous call they wanted to remind investors that there is normally an increase in subscriptions around December, with previous quarters showing the following losses:<br />

<br />
Mists of Pandaria Talent System<br />
So my question is, with only 6 'tiers' of talents after MoP, what is happening to all the other talents that are currently in game? Are they going to be skills you learn from your class trainer, either active or passive? Or removed from the game completely?<br />
<br />
A little of both. To better explain, let's divide the current talents into five categories: 1) mandatory, 2) very cool, but not mandatory, 3) sort of cool, 4) boring, and 5) useless.<br />
<br />
We're going to give you all of the &quot;mandatory&quot; talents to your class spec, and you'll learn those talents at certain levels like you do with core class spells. Players who skip over what we consider mandatory talents today -- like Raging Blow or Hot Streak -- are unintentionally (or maybe even intentionally) gimping themselves, and that's not what we want to have happen. We want players to be able to experience the full power of their class, so we're going to award certain talents straight-out. <br />
<br />
The second category of talents -- the cool, but not mandatory ones -- are really the heart of the new talent system (they're the talents you'll probably be choosing from in each of new six tiers). You may be glad you have talent A, but talent B and talent C are also compelling options, and it should ideally be an interesting choice about which one you take and when.<br />
<br />
The third category of talents are still pretty cool, but they just aren't at the same level as other talents. These talents make good glyphs. For example, an early version of the warrior tree had Rude Interruption as a talent, but we feel it's too situational to compete with the other talents, so we'll likely make it a glyph. <br />
<br />
The next category are boring talents -- the kind that reduce cooldowns or increase damage on some abilities. In most cases, we're just baking talents these right into the spells themselves. While there were occasionally situations where you got to decide which of these talents to take, the answers often relied on complex math problems that some other player ended up solving for most of us. <br />
<br />
Finally, the current trees (despite our best efforts) still have some bad talents. They're the talents you almost inevtiably end up with when you have a talent tree with X rows and Y columns that you need to populate. In the end, not a lot of players end up taking these talents, so we'll just cut them. We don't think they'll be missed, but if turns out that players wind up actually missing some of the Cataclysm talents in the Mist of Pandaria design, then we've probably made a mistake somewhere. Ideally, you won't miss a thing and will have more fun picking talents that cater to your play style (or, at the very least, the current situation.) <br />

New Warcraft Art<br />
The World of Warcraft: Classes (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/media/artwork/wow-classes#/1) and Cataclysm (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/media/artwork/wow-cataclysm#/1) Art galleries have been updated with five new pieces of Warcraft artwork.<br />

<br />
Guess they need some sort of &quot;proof&quot; that the &quot;game is dying&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
Even if WoW loses half it's subscribers, I can bet that it's still the game with the most subscribers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
doesnt matter to me honestly, sub numbers dont mean shit to me when it comes to a game i enjoy. people have been predicting swtors downfall for awhile now and it may be possible that their subs numbers are low, but i enjoy the game and ill continue to play it until its not fun anymore. which is something all WoW players should do, if youre still having fun screw whatever is posted on the forums about &quot;the game dying&quot; and continue playing what gives you satisfaction.<br />
<br />
someone from bioware already stated that swtor would be profitable with only 500k subs, i can imagine any other mmo is in the same boat. wow aint going nowhere</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exactly. It's still way more subs than any other MMO out there.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because the playerbase will simply tell any player making the &quot;wrong&quot; decision to L2P and go visit EJ.<br />
Players will be expected to use the optimum build, and to be honest how many players anymore know why those builds are as they are, rather than just following them.<br />
This just cuts out the pointless bit before it, where everyone with a brain simply has the same as anyone else.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't understand why people are so obsessed with Sub numbers.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unless you work for blizz, you shouldn't care about the sub numbers<br />
<br />
Because stupid players who have personal reasons for leaving are simply unable to admit as such, and will use any excuse including numbers they have no understanding of, and including in some cases personal attacks launched at blizzard staff members.</div></div><hr />

You are wrong. Sorry to sound arrogant, but this is not my opinion. This is a fact. Why? Let's explain it in easy words.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard is a company. The main thing which drives a company is not profit, it is maximizing profit.<br />
<br />
WoW's sudden drop in subscription numbers directly impact the companies financial situation.<br />
<br />
WoW's subscription numbers can be influenced in a lot of ways. It can range from the added competition in the MMO Market (SW:TOR for example), customer dissatisfaction (Game Design for example) or just natural causes (EVERY product has the same life cycle. Once it reaches it's peak, it will drop slowly). Mind you, there are far more factors.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can address this in a variety of ways. Like for example investing more money into marketing, which is highly illogical at this stage. If Blizzard thinks the main reason of people canceling their subscriptions due to customer dissatisfaction with their product, they may have to rethink their game design philosophy (something you have experienced recently). However, it can become much worse. With a dropping budget, Blizzard may address to the ever-dropping budget in a variety ways, from sacking employees (Less GM's, Less Artists and etc.) to just restricting the content created (Less money to spend means less work on raids, instances and etc.)<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, an opposite thing may happen. Even though they generate less revenue, Blizzard may invest more money into producing higher-quality content, which may return their old customers and attract new ones.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Blizzards financial situation DOES impact you, either you like it or not.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You're failing to understand the reasoning for that.<br />
<br />
I'll give you an example.<br />
<br />
I play a Shadow Priest. My REQUIRED talent build is 8/0/31. With 2 spare points. <br />
<br />
Those 2 spare points don't change my gameplay at all. There's no fun in the talent system for my spec. I either finish up Mental Agility (reduces spell cost), pick up a bit of Inner Sanctum (reduces spell damage taken), go nuts on Phantasm (removes all moving imparing effects when I use Fade), pick up Psychic Horror (a fear and disarm) and do something else with the extra point, pick up Paralysys (a stun when my Mind Blast crits), or Improved Power Word: Shield.<br />
<br />
I'd love to be able to get Silence, but I can't, because I have to spend 3 points for it, which I don't have.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It basically said raiders used to have respect for other raiders who achieved certain goals in wow but now there is no respect for hardcore players in the game anymore. They also mention that the smarter/professional players enjoy eve for intellectual stimulation and wow is stimulation for the masses, anything from street sweepers, drug abusers as they don't need to have there wits about them to achieve something in the game.<br />
<br />
It was basically saying if your dumb you will enjoy wow.</div></div><hr />

This person hit the nail on the head.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Woa</div><div class="date">2012-01-21, 06:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the topic of giving mandatory talents, I think its the wrong g choice as was getting rid of hybrid builds whether they were intended to find a weird strong point on your char or just a new dumb dumb in the game. The latter is the thing that I don't like. Pvp lost something when they made you go down one tree. You no longer had a learning curve as a noob to learn how to spec. I enjoyed seeing those guys in bgs and killing them with three spells. As such when I started it was frustrating and gave me something else to learn about. It should be there for someone to learn their class and what's right. It added another small layer of skill to produce a spec that wasn't dumb. Sure all end game level players pick a cookie cutter spec but not until they mess with 10 other dumb builds. <br />
<br />
To me its just another small step down for the game. I enjoy a game that makes me think and learn how to play. As of now you go in game the create character screen asks you if you want to be a tank, healer or dps or all of them. You pick something you like and you're handed levels left and right. It SHOULD take me a month to get level capped. Its something of an achievement....or it was. As of stands now I can get 85a in a week easily on anything as any spec.<br />
<br />
I don't necessarily mean the game has to be hard it just needs to take longer to aquire levels and gear. <br />
<br />
I haven't played in almost a year and I do miss it a lot sometimes. I left because all the classes morphed into one it seems. No one had any special abilities. Everyone had a mortal strike, a debuff, self heals...just...everything. I also left because I need three arms to play and a computer brain to remember all my key binds. It was work.<br />
<br />
Ill be back for mop but if they don't make it super immersive and take a little more work to get something to be proud of its not going to give me any pleasure and ill probably go pew pew with a light sabre in swtor or team kill ppl in bf3.</div></div><hr />

I'm hoping to see more sub losses. In all honesty, how long can you expect people to keep playing the same crap? Releasing &quot;new&quot; expansions doesn't solve this problem. :cool:<br />

Ohh are you one of those people that power level through games the first week it comes out and say &quot;it has no end game... blah blah blah&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Even if WoW loses half it's subscribers, I can bet that it's still the game with the most subscribers.<br />
<br />
Pretty much.<br />
<br />
Most people forget that WoW has in its entire history been a complete anomaly in terms of its popularity. The fact that it's going to take over 7-8 years to even come close to what other games boast in subscription numbers and yet still be the most popular game on the market speaks undeniable truths about the game's success.<br />
<br />
That is something that the game's detractors can never deny without exposing themselves as idiots or biased. WoW has and continues to be incredibly popular. And considering that most MMOs only get the axe when it has 40,000 players left, it's going to be a VERY LONG TIME until WoW's servers shut down.</div></div><hr />

And with developers like these and an old engine (it was old even when WoW came out, the graphics are so bad), it will die even faster than you think.Considering the amount of money they get, they could release new raids every month or two. But, of course, they are blinded by the money and want to do as little as possible, because they know fanboys like you will still play their crap. Maybe you are some die-hard players, but even if you don't want to quit, you'll have to play a total crap with kids worshiping pandas.Also, I am pretty sure this time they'll lie and say the number of subscribers went up because of Christmas.

The latter is the thing that I don't like. Pvp lost something when they made you go down one tree. You no longer had a learning curve as a noob to learn how to spec. I enjoyed seeing those guys in bgs and killing them with three spells. As such when I started it was frustrating and gave me something else to learn about. It should be there for someone to learn their class and what's right. It added another small layer of skill to produce a spec that wasn't dumb. Sure all end game level players pick a cookie cutter spec but not until they mess with 10 other dumb builds. <br />
<br />
To me its just another small step down for the game. I enjoy a game that makes me think and learn how to play. As of now you go in game the create character screen asks you if you want to be a tank, healer or dps or all of them. You pick something you like and you're handed levels left and right. It SHOULD take me a month to get level capped. Its something of an achievement....or it was. As of stands now I can get 85a in a week easily on anything as any spec.<br />
<br />
I don't necessarily mean the game has to be hard it just needs to take longer to aquire levels and gear. <br />
<br />
I haven't played in almost a year and I do miss it a lot sometimes. I left because all the classes morphed into one it seems. No one had any special abilities. Everyone had a mortal strike, a debuff, self heals...just...everything. I also left because I need three arms to play and a computer brain to remember all my key binds. It was work.<br />
<br />
Ill be back for mop but if they don't make it super immersive and take a little more work to get something to be proud of its not going to give me any pleasure and ill probably go pew pew with a light sabre in swtor or team kill ppl in bf3.<br />
<br />
But the thing is it ISN'T each individual player &quot;making the decisions&quot; about which talents to pick by using the honed skills of years of playing their class. They google arena junkies or elitist jerks to see which talents are REQUIRED for them to perform optimally (as anything beyond a few points deviation majorly impacts their performance.) This is what the majority of players with the &quot;correct&quot; talent build do. They don't sit at their desks and number crunch the weights of crit percentages versus flat damage increases. <br />
<br />
Players that have exceptionally poor talent builds, for the most part, unfortunately do not realize that it's their talent build gimping them so much (likely the talent build they selected when leveling, and therefore highly skewed into more &quot;situational&quot; talents,) and instead think they just need to &quot;push the buttons harder&quot; (as they likely don't have a good rotation either) or just fall back into being under-performing players. <br />
<br />

<br />
You shouldn't, even if wow loses 1 million subscribers each year, it will still have a million left in 8 years.<br />
All an MMO needs to run and still produce content is around 100k-200k players, just look at EQ2, lotro, rift, etc, they all run very well still.<br />
Even UO is still running after 16 years, despite in a relaunched version, but hey it still runs and it still gets expansions.<br />

<br />
Many reasons why it matters to the players and not just the stockholders:<br />
<br />
1) Absence of people for guilds. Right now many servers are suffering from population shortages... that's really bad if you're trying to recruit new raiders/guildies. <br />
<br />
2) If subs dropped down to 100k people... Blizzard would divert 95% of the resources over to other games in development (probably titan) as they need to make money and won't shell the better portion of their money/resources into a game that is no longer making them the millions they need to survive and fund goodness knows how many games in development.<br />
<br />
3) All your wonderful happy expansions, bug fixes and patch content will go out the door with the diversion of resources. Already we're seeing a decrease in content with patches/expansions and development. Imagine that times whatever the next loss might be. <br />
<br />
Those are just a FEW of the things off the top of my head I can think of. I'm sure if I delved into it more, there's a lot more things that lower subs can impact.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bathory</div><div class="date">2012-01-21, 07:37 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are wrong. Sorry to sound arrogant, but this is not my opinion. This is a fact. Why? Let's explain it in easy words.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard is a company. The main thing which drives a company is not profit, it is maximizing profit.<br />
<br />
WoW's sudden drop in subscription numbers directly impact the companies financial situation.<br />
<br />
WoW's subscription numbers can be influenced in a lot of ways. It can range from the added competition in the MMO Market (SW:TOR for example), customer dissatisfaction (Game Design for example) or just natural causes (EVERY product has the same life cycle. Once it reaches it's peak, it will drop slowly). Mind you, there are far more factors.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can address this in a variety of ways. Like for example investing more money into marketing, which is highly illogical at this stage. If Blizzard thinks the main reason of people canceling their subscriptions due to customer dissatisfaction with their product, they may have to rethink their game design philosophy (something you have experienced recently). However, it can become much worse. With a dropping budget, Blizzard may address to the ever-dropping budget in a variety ways, from sacking employees (Less GM's, Less Artists and etc.) to just restricting the content created (Less money to spend means less work on raids, instances and etc.)<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, an opposite thing may happen. Even though they generate less revenue, Blizzard may invest more money into producing higher-quality content, which may return their old customers and attract new ones.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Blizzards financial situation DOES impact you, either you like it or not.<br />
<br />
Yeah it does, but what exactly can we do about it? So unless you're suggesting we all start buying multiple accounts, I don't see how I should care about this either. Might impact me yes, but do I care? No</div></div><hr />

There's a few that listens far more to their playerbase, but also some who does it far less. An example is Arenanet, since day 1 they have listened to the playerbase and made changes to the game, which had to fit the playstyle too ofcourse. They even let people design art and then put it in game.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard listens to it's playerbase a great deal as well. Unfortunately, the people that play WoW don't all want the same thing, and tend to get very angry when the next development blizzard comes out with isn't what they specifically wished for.</div></div><hr />

Even so.. rift,EQ and others seem to find ways to push out content. What ever the number is wont mark the end of anything. <br />
For all we know the subs probably already left. So whatever happens it only feels bad because we get to see a #. <br />
Feb. 8th: Im enjoying this game. :)<br />
Feb 9th: Wow subs down server are gonna shut down! QQ! What know Blizz!! -_-<br />
despite this ill expect the worse but look forward to the future w/ MoP, Titan, and EXP. 5 or any other affordable wow content as well as D3. My guess: 500-700K sub drop.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc6af618f320</div><div class="date">2012-01-21, 08:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As someone on the 1st page said, Blizz is a company, the argument &quot;they are still 1st&quot; doesn't apply, they want to maximize profits. 50k loss is noticeable. Anyway the loss in Q4 won't be that big because of Annual pass (paying people to stay subbed) and also new patch came and they gave 7 free days which a lot of people used, I am sure those will count as &quot;subs&quot; in Q4 too. <br />
<br />
Also I didn't think in a complex way but now when I see it, so far in 2011 they lost 1.700.000 players. A game that ended TBC at 12mil and ended WotLK at 12mil aswell suddenly has, after 1st year of Cata, about 2mil less players (being nice, assuming they loose 300k in Q4). If this isn't some sort of a heads up &quot;you are doing something f**king wrong, stop it, fire people who implemented those changes&quot; then I don't know what is... <br />
<br />
Hell if this continues then in 3 years which is when the expansion after MoP could be coming out (rumoured to be the last one by some people due to the release of Titan) WoW might very well have just about 4mil players, 1/3 of what it used to have.<br />
<br />
Yea and one more thing, I am kinda impartial, can't say I am sad or happy but for those people who wan't to see the real &quot;bomb&quot; in subscription loss, that will be Q1/2012. No 7 free days, no new raid/patch in sight... There might even be over 1 mill loss in the single Q.</div></div><hr />

Players will be expected to use the optimum build, and to be honest how many players anymore know why those builds are as they are, rather than just following them.<br />
This just cuts out the pointless bit before it, where everyone with a brain simply has the same as anyone else.<br />

<br />
<br />
It's already pretty hard to make big mistakes with talents. You have to fill up a whole tree first before you can spec into the others and almost all the talents are usefull and good. When I was speccing my protection warrior there was only one talent that was 'bad' (it was still usefull).<br />
I haven't witnessed someone telling someone else they had to respec either. It's not like the old days where someone sometimes put an equal amount of talents in every talent tree.<br />
<br />
A lot of players are not that nice but if you tell someone to look up on EJ/MMO-C what the best talents are etc. then that is the best advice you can give. It has all the information they ever need and it will teach them to look things up in 5 minutes time.<br />
<br />
The game is already streamlined, accessible and easy. I really don't care anymore if they make things even easier but let me tell you this: it's really freaking boring for anyone who has played WoW for half a year and is experienced. Long time subscribers only have hardmodes that are challenging for them and the rest is just boring farm now. Everything is done for them and you barely have to think about anything you do. Maybe a talent tree isn't a big deal but together with everything else...<br />

No, I hope they drop a lot so they finally HAVE TO change this shit game to something good. Yes, I said shit game. If it wasn't for my friend who wants to do serious Arena I would have already quit after three weeks. Everything is boring to me. I already had this week that I wanted to play because I didn't really had something else to do at the time but when I got online there was just nothing fun to do and there wasn't something that I could farm that I needed (already have PvE gear that I don't really need and I already had all my honor gear so now it's just waiting each week for valor/conquest caps).

Blizzard was able to recognize this. So they took out the unneeded &quot;skill&quot; of googling the optimum talents that someone else came up with. I don't see why that's so hard to understand. It's like people are saying &quot;I want (other) players to have the CHOICE of accidentally being terrible&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem with this view is, in my opinion, twofold. <br />
<br />
First, there is pretty obviously going to be even less choice with the new MoP system than the &quot;anything beyond a few points deviation&quot; you mention. I played a discipline priest, and I had a number of real choices to make on talents involving prioritizing survivability, mana management, raid vs. tank healing, and even completely different play styles with talents like atonement and archangel. And that's not even getting into pvp builds for arena or bg healing, which are very different from the PvE builds. The 'choices' presented by the new system are basically cosmetic. At best, with the new system I'm going to be losing a few choices of abilities and a fair amount of flexibility. <br />
<br />
Buy hey, maybe I'm worrying too much about details. After all, beta isn't even out yet, right? Nothing is finalized. And that brings us to what I think is going to be the second problem with the MoP talents. Blizzard is rebuilding the whole talent system from scratch. This is the same team that wrecked entire specs with the initial Cataclysm changes, and arguably hasn't gotten some things fixed well over a year later. And now the same crew is re-creating the whole thing from the ground up? And people honestly think this is a good idea?<br />
<br />
It's like letting your mechanically disinclined little brother take your car on a road trip, and when he brings it back with what are obviously a few mechanical problems, telling him to just take it all apart and put it back together. After all, what could possibly go wrong?<br />
<br />
I do have to admit, the more I read about the new talent scheme, the more tempted I am to resub for 5.0, just to watch the inevitable hilarity. I expect it's going to make Ret Pallys in 3.0 look like a walk in the park. XD<br />

<br />
I would guess that the reason people care about sub numbers is that they are hoping a big enough crash in subs will cause upper management at Activision to decide that the game is being wrecked by its current developers, and that a new team will be brought in to hopefully take WoW in a more positive direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't know how GMs and officers are able to maintain a guild in current wow , literally they have to have no life since raiders and normal members need to spend hardly any time in game outside of raids, but guild management have to put more time in the game by default. Before in BC players would spend almost as much time as GMs, it's not suprising that guilds are breaking up faster then before.<br />

Also wow runs with the same ideals as communism, where street sweepers (bads), bank tellers (casuals), rocket scientists (hardcore players) earn the same rewards with the effect that everyone wants to become a street sweeper since there is no incentive to put more effort in, thats why activity in game is at a all time low and how are you supposed to build good communities around that.</div></div><hr />

For the 1st time it might actually feel like im making a choice when choosing them. I do not however like the idea of levelling without reward, even if that reward doesnt really make too much difference, its just nice to feel like im getting something. In fact I would like to get to choose something at every level, maybe just treat going up a lvl like completing a quest and reward us with a choice between a few shiny pieces of loot (for some vague continuity it could be a gift from our trainer or something). Hell, id be happy with cosmetic crap, anything that makes me think im getting something for my efforts, prefferably with a choice involved</div></div><hr />

<br />
Q4 means Oct,Nov,Dec.The only possible increase of subs was 4.3 release.However in the late Dec we had TOR release which made a lot of people,who already seen everything they wanted to see in 4.3, to feeze their WoW account.<br />
My guess is Q4 will have as many active subs as Q3 does.</div></div><hr />

Nobody wants to be 'the help'. Even if Tirion helped us in ICC with a mass ress, we still did all the heavy lifting when it came to finishing the Lich King fight. Even if the Blue Dragons helped us with Kil'jaeden, we still did all the hard work. And so on and so forth, but helping Blizzard's favourite Mary-Sue save the day was not what I had in mind when I bought Cataclysm; I imagined fighting Deathwing in his human form (which was resigned to some dumb Badlands quests), and then in a Shadow of the Colossus-esque fashion, fighting our away across Deathwing's body and bringing him down, perhaps some manner of legendary sword being thrust into his head as he flew around on his path of terror and destruction in a King Arthur fashion.<br />
<br />
Instead we got a boss that we hardly ever saw, save for being a general inconvenience when he burned zones; 99% of the Deathwing we saw this expansion was simply the aftermath of Deathwing, and i'd take the Lich King, who made a point of checking up on his future Scourge champions, over that any day.I'm sure people have their own reasons for quitting, but for those with a lore inclination that's likely one of them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
it matters because less profit = less content and development. This seems to be the way Blizzard seems to handle it and will probably (complete speculation at this time) handle it for the forseeable future. <br />
<br />
From the 3rd Quarter report 2011:<br />
&quot;Blizzard saw profits decline 38% to $297 million in the third quarter in contrast to the year before, whereas operating income fell by more than half to $120 million from $246 million last year.&quot;<br />
<br />
So, this is why WoW is in a lacklustre state. How do you suppose they cut operating costs? <br />
Less development of the game, art models, raids, of course. Certainly looks to me like WoW has had significant budget cuts. <br />
<br />

<br />
The weird thing is that - instead of improving things to attract more subscribers, my personal speculation - based purely on this report, it seems like the marketing / development team is in a winding down, cutting losses mode. Weird.<br />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard is a company. The main thing which drives a company is not profit, it is maximizing profit.<br />
<br />
WoW's sudden drop in subscription numbers directly impact the companies financial situation.<br />
<br />
WoW's subscription numbers can be influenced in a lot of ways. It can range from the added competition in the MMO Market (SW:TOR for example), customer dissatisfaction (Game Design for example) or just natural causes (EVERY product has the same life cycle. Once it reaches it's peak, it will drop slowly). Mind you, there are far more factors.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can address this in a variety of ways. Like for example investing more money into marketing, which is highly illogical at this stage. If Blizzard thinks the main reason of people canceling their subscriptions due to customer dissatisfaction with their product, they may have to rethink their game design philosophy (something you have experienced recently). However, it can become much worse. With a dropping budget, Blizzard may address to the ever-dropping budget in a variety ways, from sacking employees (Less GM's, Less Artists and etc.) to just restricting the content created (Less money to spend means less work on raids, instances and etc.)<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, an opposite thing may happen. Even though they generate less revenue, Blizzard may invest more money into producing higher-quality content, which may return their old customers and attract new ones.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Blizzards financial situation DOES impact you, either you like it or not.<br />
<br />
This^^ <br />

and to say it once again for people that are still live in a dream world<br />

So what is the talent system about anyway? If a player skips Raging Blow/ Chimera Shot/Hot Streak/Maelstrom in his talent tree, it is either suprising he is smart enough to turn on his computer, or he does not need those in his current fight/pvp build. Working fine for me. 6 talent trees is a total misunderstanding of the problem. The problem is that talents are rock solid builds dragged from the internet, and if somebody dpses in different setup, he does less dps. 6 talent trees idea:<br />
-Gives a player 6 (freaking 6) possibilities to customize his character spec in any way<br />
-Still gives a few tiers with talents usable once, maybe twice in the entire expansion<br />
-Tiers with interesting talents are going to have &quot;best&quot; talents anyway. <br />
Example with hunter talents (Hunter PvE): <br />
T1: Frozen Arrows, Arcane Arrows, Venom Tipped Arrows? <br />
Frozen Arrows have kinda no use in any way, as frost trap works way better. Arcane and Venom Tipped Arrows? Lets wait until somebody checks his dps with both and shows which is better. 1 option to choose. <br />
T2: Silencing Shot, Wyvern Sting, Intimidation? From whole Cata the only boss where Stun was usable was Ragnaros. Until a boss like this happens, Intimidation is skipped. So Silence or Wyvern? Wyvern may work on some trash, but your team probably has enough cc anyway. CCs, that after break dont have an annoyting dot. So Silencing Shot, a nice interrupt/silence. 1 option to choose. <br />
T3: Posthaste, Evasiveness, Exhilaration? You are raiding? Evasiveness may be the &quot;Oh fuck&quot; button. Posthaste may be useful in add kiting. Exhilaration may help your healers, and corrects your mistakes, if you make them. Best tier, 3 choices. Depends on fight. <br />
T4: Crouching Tiger, Iron Hawk or Spirit Bond? <br />
Why, the hell, should you choose any of those except of Iron Hawk? 1 choice. <br />
T5: Fervor, Readiness, Thrill of the Hunt? <br />
3 dps cooldowns. Fervor is way behind, so dont count it in. Lets wait until somebody calculates which of the remaining provides best dps. 1 choice. <br />
T6: Flash Freeze, Black Ice, Transmorph Trap? Flash Freeze is nothing in PvE. Black Ice can be useful in kiting. Transmorph Trap may be useful with some adds - unless they are immune. Maybe 2 choices. <br />
<br />
Therefore, only 2 of 6 tiers give a choice for PvE. And this is the way to make talents a more personal system? Come on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But you’re complaining that they’re uneven choices not that the system is bad. I think picking six abilities that actually effect your gameplay is a better system than being the same as every other [spec goes here]. What you seem to be arguing here is that there should be an obvious PVE option for every tier or be directly PVE related. Mobility and kiting cooldowns are PVE related when PVE content is designed around the need for those abilities. What it comes down to is if Blizzard can design equal choices along with content that makes use of them.</div></div><hr />

I agree with this. WoW used to feel like a game with a lot of depth and always something there that you haven't seen. When it came to raiding, I loved the Vanilla and TBC model, even when I didn't always get to see the last hardest dungeon because our guild wasn't good enough for it. <br />
<br />
Our raid calendar was full of different dungeons. At one point we were doing Kara, Gruul, Magtheridon, ZA, Tempest Keep and SSC. What do you raid now? Mostly just the latest raid over and over again. That's because of the gear resets and making the latest dungeon available to everyone in many different difficulty levels. I hate the different difficulty level concept. When I have cleared a dungeon once, I don't want to start grinding it again and again with a notch higher difficulty. Instead I want to do what we did in Vanilla and TBC: Move to the next tier of new harder dungeons with better rewards. Blizzard gave up on that because a bunch of people were saying they should see every dungeon even if they are crap at the game. Now everyone is getting bored because of it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ovaltine</div><div class="date">2012-01-21, 01:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I, for one, love the direction they are going with the talent system. It's a minimalistic way of viewing the cumbersome and overwhelming talent systems we've had in the past. <br />
<br />
The amount of permutations is quite large (not good at math if anyone wishes to do it) and it takes the need to look anything up on the net. According to Blizzard, there may be a &quot;min/max&quot; spec and such, but with the fact that all of these flavor talents are for playstyle rather than &quot;must have or you get laughed out of the raid or RBG&quot;, then I feel you will see people taking what THEY want. <br />
<br />
Example: My wife and I sat down with the paladin trees and just went at it. Worked out 4 different sets each and all of them felt as if they would be viable for PvP (which we both play).<br />
<br />
As far as the Sub loss? Well, whats the total number of lost subs vs the overall number they had before the loss? Probably a decent chunk, but I wouldn't be surprised if the tried-and-true method holds. Players leave for other games /boredom. Then they come back after a bit / new expansion. <br />

It are mostly the die hard WoW fans defending the game better than their own moms, who state that sub drops doesn't matter a thing. It does affect them, because it means:<br />
<br />
- Less people will be playing in your server because of the drops, my server went from full to low<br />

You only got stuck early if you were crap at the game. That is supposed to happen so you have an incentive to become better and there were rewards for doing so.

it's just simple marketing theory. you are saying its an opinion and is wrong?<br />
its not about whether or not you will play it till the end, its probably that there will be nothing new to do for you untill that moment comes because that point where the latest content comes out and the shutdown can take years. Unless some actions are taken to stretch its adult phase in the life cycle, the scenario's people call out here are quite accurate. if nothing is done to stretch it or to (re)innovate the product, its busy with creating its downfall. <br />

With the grief that people get for choosing the &quot;wrong spec&quot; or talents, i can see why they're doing this. They want the game to be appealing to people who don't have all day to read wowhead, or EJ or whatever. Seems like a good choice imo</div></div><hr />

<br />
It doesn't take &quot;all day&quot; to go find a quick blurb on EJ regarding the class you're playing. I took a little break from WoW. When I came back, I went over the talent tree, saw if anything was changed, what talents did what then went over to EJ, looked up my class and saw what they had to say about talents and specing. Took me all of 15 minutes for something I most likely won't change now for at least six months. <br />
<br />
It really isn't all the hard, or time consuming, to find this information anymore. It's not 2004 and this is not a new game. <br />
<br />

<br />
I have to agree with this comment. I have zero interest in hardmodes. For me when I came back, I wanted to just wanted to complete the current raid and hunt up a bunch of achievements that I wanted on my rogue. LFR allows me to this without my blood pressure going threw the roof. I still prefer the Wrath model for this, but it is what it is. <br />
<br />
My guild is also now running an &quot;alt&quot; raid that I can make, so I will be able to hopefully complete the epic dagger quest before MoP launches. Sure, there isn't as much raiding available anymore, but really, do you want to go back to the 4 nights a week model?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting to note there are a ton of reasons why many players still play wow. <br />
<br />
You know something, the community is a huge factor in why players still pay for their subscription. If subs go down, then I can assure you that subs will also go down. If few people log on everyday on your server, then I can assure you the subs will go down.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is some of us like swords and dragons and magic in our fantasy mmo's and they've already said that Titan will be a different type of game. Whether it be steam punk or space or western or post apocalyptic or who knows what, it may not be what those of us who love this game for what it is actually look for in a game. I forget where i read it but they even went as far as to say Titan wouldn't kill wow either, that it would be another type of game that even though mmo fans may love it not all wow style enthusiasts would find it attractive. Some of us love warcraft and diablo but dont play starcraft, the same as I like the star wars franchise and movies but its not what I look for in an mmo.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In which way ? Logging in is not a criteria for the number of active subscriptions. As long as they can say &quot;look how many people still pay&quot; they don't care. They might even make money this way because their bandwith/power consumptions/hardware requirements will go down if playing people don't log in but still pay.<br />
<br />
As for the whole loss in subscribers, sadly most of them are said to be chinese people. They seem to have a better grasp of the whole &quot;speak with your wallet&quot; concept.<br />
<br />
<br />
If heroic mode was standard you'd still be stuck at Nefarian atm. It's not fun to rush but it's not fun to be stuck either, you need balance. <br />
Thats where early wotlk did kind of a nice job along with late TBC. They used to nerf the old content so people could catch up and showered them in easier attainable epics of that previous content via cheaper to get dungeon points instead of nerfing the current content before most people even had the time to sink their teeth into it. Some guy said it quite nice. I want to progress through the content once, this makes it interesting, this immerses me in the story, this gives me an incentive to become better - not just having it handed to you, having it done already in 2 modes and just playing the 3rd mode for cosmetic gain. Its the same content with diffrent numbers, while I like a challenge hardmodes this tear hardly have any new ablities. Most of it along with the few new abilities is just more hps/dps, which frankly is enough to get my attention and that of many others.</div></div><hr />

Its a good thing they are losing players. Why is it there not vary menny good MMOs out ? WoW kills them before they can grow and become Grate.<br />
This is not a good thing. I do not wont wow the be the only grate MMO for 7+ more years.<br />
<br />
There is a good MMO just came out SWTOR and more on the way like GW2 or lost world. If WoW stays at 10+mill thats all they ever will be good not grate and will probably will die out because of WOW<br />

Unless you work for blizz, you shouldn't care about the sub numbers Now see, the thing about the subscribers is quite simple imo. Blizzard re-invented the game in cata, and they gained a hefty ammount of subs, however, these kind of subscribers are the kind of players who don't stick with a game for too long, I think what we are seeing is the kind of turnover you get from the more casual playerbase.<br />

They are what we call niche marketers. They don't want to be a powerhouse, they want to steal a bit of wow's playerbase and are happy with that. Rift is a perfect example, their whole advertising campaign was we have what wow players want. However, this was only a little bit of the wow playerbase, enough to make Rift profitable, Gw2 could be great, but no raiding? it's purpose is to steal from wow's PvP playerbase. Starwars, Awesome questing! Take from wow's questers. Now it may be they are too afraid to actually invest a ton of money to not only match, but excel in every aspect of wow, but we are seeing what happens when you don't, Ea stock has dropped cause of star wars. there is a economic saying, for something to become competitive in the market, it needs to be 10x better. so far, nothing can pull that off.</div></div><hr />

The sub numbers reflect the quality, audience and direction of the game...and Blizzard has shifted all three almost 180 degrees in the past few years. The quality of the game is down, the raids are boring, easy and disconnected from all the players. Nobody really cares about Deathwing, heck lots of people don't even know his name they refer to him as &quot;the cataclysm dragon&quot;... The numbers reflect that, despite people not agreeing with game changes in the past, these cross the line for a significant percentage of the player base. It's not to be taken lightly. The audience has changed as well, the game is no longer designed with an audience who likes to do research on a game. It's no longer &quot;a grind&quot;, when in fact the grind, and time consuming elements of the game created a certain charm that is now gone. I'm sorry if this may offend you, but the game has turned into a console type instant success button. Which means that many of the people that liked the game for what it was, don't like it for what it is now. And many may have put up with it for a long time, I'm going to assume that Cata may have been their breaking point. And finally the direction of the game. At the rate of the current development style and mindset, where do you see wow in 5 years? If you would have asked me this question in BC, I would NOT even remotely think that we would be where we are today. If you ask me where will WoW be in 5 years today, I can tell you that unless something dramatic changes, wow will suffer the same fate as SWG. &quot;It was good until patch x&quot; Thanks for reading.</div></div><hr />

We had the annual pass and 4.3 from Blizz which I expect raised the sub numbers by a couple hundred thousand because people wanted to experience the over-hyped Deathwing and try out LFR. SWTOR also launched with a lot of hype so it definitely had an affect on the sub numbers. My overall prediction for Q4 is a loss of 300,000 subs though.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Choose the abilities you want to use!&quot;<br />
<br />
The only difference is that in Guild Wars you have to unlock abilities, and you can only change them inside a town. Blizzard will allow you to change whenever, so why bother with it in the first place? Just give everybody all of the 'Talents' in their spell book and make them choose a maximum of 6 that they can place on their bars!</div></div><hr />

<br />
So if Star wars have better questing and GW2 have better pvp what makes wow the greatest super MMO? Dragon Soul raid? I am not bashing it, I played this game 6+ years and this game was Number 1 for Raids/Dungeons and had an interesting World and a challenging leveling once. After some time it gave up to other areas and only kept the Dungeons/Raids but lately it destroyed their only big Advantage...Gear reset through dungeons every 3-4 months was the biggest mistake ever...it is like they put you to grind 1 raid for 3-4 months until one day a patch comes out, give all people free the gear you got those months from raiding and give you another raid to grind for the next 3-4 months..</div></div><hr />

Oh I don't know, maybe because the increase or decrease in subscriptions has a direct impact on the company's income and how it will change, modify, and update the game in the future?

Lol. So basically in your eyes the scenario is going t be this. If they lose subs you'll say &quot;see, told you they're sinking'.

So what is the talent system about anyway? If a player skips Raging Blow/ Chimera Shot/Hot Streak/Maelstrom in his talent tree, it is either suprising he is smart enough to turn on his computer, or he does not need those in his current fight/pvp build. Working fine for me. 6 talent trees is a total misunderstanding of the problem. The problem is that talents are rock solid builds dragged from the internet, and if somebody dpses in different setup, he does less dps. 6 talent trees idea:<br />
-Gives a player 6 (freaking 6) possibilities to customize his character spec in any way<br />
-Still gives a few tiers with talents usable once, maybe twice in the entire expansion<br />
-Tiers with interesting talents are going to have &quot;best&quot; talents anyway. <br />
Example with hunter talents (Hunter PvE): <br />
T1: Frozen Arrows, Arcane Arrows, Venom Tipped Arrows? <br />
Frozen Arrows have kinda no use in any way, as frost trap works way better. Arcane and Venom Tipped Arrows? Lets wait until somebody checks his dps with both and shows which is better. 1 option to choose. <br />
T2: Silencing Shot, Wyvern Sting, Intimidation? From whole Cata the only boss where Stun was usable was Ragnaros. Until a boss like this happens, Intimidation is skipped. So Silence or Wyvern? Wyvern may work on some trash, but your team probably has enough cc anyway. CCs, that after break dont have an annoyting dot. So Silencing Shot, a nice interrupt/silence. 1 option to choose. <br />
T3: Posthaste, Evasiveness, Exhilaration? You are raiding? Evasiveness may be the &quot;Oh fuck&quot; button. Posthaste may be useful in add kiting. Exhilaration may help your healers, and corrects your mistakes, if you make them. Best tier, 3 choices. Depends on fight. <br />
T4: Crouching Tiger, Iron Hawk or Spirit Bond? <br />
Why, the hell, should you choose any of those except of Iron Hawk? 1 choice. <br />
T5: Fervor, Readiness, Thrill of the Hunt? <br />
3 dps cooldowns. Fervor is way behind, so dont count it in. Lets wait until somebody calculates which of the remaining provides best dps. 1 choice. <br />
T6: Flash Freeze, Black Ice, Transmorph Trap? Flash Freeze is nothing in PvE. Black Ice can be useful in kiting. Transmorph Trap may be useful with some adds - unless they are immune. Maybe 2 choices. <br />
<br />
Therefore, only 2 of 6 tiers give a choice for PvE. And this is the way to make talents a more personal system? Come on.<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to agree with your point, the hunter tree is absolute CRAP. Again, no defensive CD to use like most other classes, no raid buff thats actually usefull, same crap over and over again.</div></div><hr />

In WoW you either had the right spec or you didnt. There was ONE right choice for all specs with a few floater points.<br />
<br />
You only had the illusion of a choice, you either did it right or wrong. <br />

Its a series of fluff choices that all do roughly the same thing and could be skipped with a relatively minor dip in performence, since each 'spec' will still have all the tools it needs to do the job. Its fluff. If thats your idea of 'choice', then bully for you. Personally it did a lot to ruin the joy of the game for me.<br />

You are the one that should get a clue. You had ~3-4 talent points that werent set in stone because what you chose with them was irrelevant anyway.</div></div><hr />

This new system is !@#$ing retarded, end of story, and people buying into the &quot;More choice!&quot; crap need to get a clue. Its a series of fluff choices that all do roughly the same thing and could be skipped with a relatively minor dip in performence, since each 'spec' will still have all the tools it needs to do the job. Its fluff. If thats your idea of 'choice', then bully for you. Personally it did a lot to ruin the joy of the game for me.It seems you don't understand what a choice is by definition. A choice is an action made when you're confronted by two possible outcomes that are implied to be equal (because if they weren't, that defeats the whole point of 'choice'). When people dumped points into all three trees in Wrath (and it happened VERY frequently), nobody associated with them because of their 'choice', forcing them to respec to something competitive, thus eliminating the idea that 'choice' ever existed because the two outcomes were vastly non-equal.However, the new talent trees in MoP do indeed offer that true 'choice': if I'm a hunter, I have a choice between shooting poison-imbued arrows, frost-imbued arrows or arcane-imbued arrows that all provide equal benefits and have equal weighted purpose. That's what people aren't understanding about the new talent trees: there isn't a 'one and done' spec anymore, which is heavily implied by the fact that you will be able to reset your talent points on the fly. Instead of specc'ing once for life and calling it day, you're going to have to sit at each encounter and think 'Hmm, what would be better here? I could use my frost arrows to slow the adds, allowing more time for them to be killed, or I could go with arcane arrows and be able to pump out more damage to put them down faster'. That's a choice; dumping points into Acuity as a shaman Shaman is not.<br />
A lot has happened in Q4. We had the annual pass and 4.3 from Blizz which I expect raised the sub numbers by a couple hundred thousand because people wanted to experience the over-hyped Deathwing and try out LFR. SWTOR also launched with a lot of hype so it definitely had an affect on the sub numbers. My overall prediction for Q4 is a loss of 300,000 subs though.Holy crap, an objective based analysis of the situation. Sir, I like you.I agree. The ease of the new dungeons (despite the 'LOL REHASH' and other complaints), LFR bringing back the ability to form PuGs that people seriously enjoyed during Wrath, an annual pass with great benefits and a revamped Darkmoon Faire that's a minimal hassle at best, I'm estimating between 200K and 500k subscriber loss, as ToR will have taken some flavor of the month players (because that's what they do). Honestly, if it's under 800K world-wide, that's a positive in my eyes since it implies the growth curve is stagnating again. Blizzard took a huge gamble with Cataclysm by listening to people complain on the forums, and those people unfortunately don't make up the majority of the player-base or the player-base's majority opinions. With the changes in 4.3, it looks like they're making smarter decisions based on what the actual player-base is looking for and not what the flavor-of-the-second, never-able-to-be-pleased group of players wants.</div></div><hr />

Like they listen to the playerbase when they brought up valid concerns during the Catacylsm beta? As I recall, when the beta testers attempted to give feedback on the forums, Ghostcrawler essentially said 'I'M TAKING MY BALL AND GOING HOME' and stopped paying attention. None of the issues were addressed, and most likely as a direct result Blizzard lost over a million and a half subs.<br />
<br />
Now people are giving feedback AGAIN, about disliking the new talent system, and AGAIN Blizzard are ignoring them. They keep spouting the same crap, they keep giving the SAME BS excuses. &quot;No more cookie cutter!&quot; No. They KNOW that's a lie. It isn't about 'cookie cutter'. It's about ease of balance. This way they KNOW what everyone has, and that everyone is so much % within each other. They don't have to balance for hypothetical numbers, such as a player not having X talent, or having Y but not having Z.</div></div><hr />

they will try to force the players out of WoW with lack of content or unsavory content changes, if they can funnel them into diablo on its release. WoW content will be lacking and players will be outraged, and diablo will be hyped, then when they sell box copies, they may bring more content to WoW in MOP, if its profitable. watch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if population means the game is good, my god, farmcraft, and runescape must be the end all be all game of the last decade, i mean, runescape has 156 million accounts, so the could lose the population equal to every other mmo on the planet, and would still be far ahead of every mmo on the planet.<br />

It doesn't matter who is the biggest or the smallest, it matters how fast things are changing. Investors are valuing AVTI based on continued growth from WoW and COD, or stability at best. Once the numbers start to decline, investors look ten years into the future and see nothing. Continued growth and rising subscribers gets buy recommendations, decline means downsizing and restructuring.Observing the subscriber declines will tell us how the future of WoW is going to unfold. Server merges and lower quality staff is the most likely outcome.As one earlier poster mentioned, the entire community has a different opinion on the direction of game. In my opinion, the present decline is the result of blizzard removing aspiration from this game. They thought that by making access to raids, bosses and gear so easy, people would want to play more. In fact, when you give people what they want, they have nothing to work towards, and they get bored.Only the most skilled players should see the rarest bosses. &quot;Hard Modes&quot; ruined the game. Destroying the community with paid character transfer and a host of other features also ruined the game.</div></div><hr />

fixed that, was bothering me, anway, about your post. These new games aren't great. they are only good. They are what we call niche marketers. They don't want to be a powerhouse, they want to steal a bit of wow's playerbase and are happy with that. Rift is a perfect example, their whole advertising campaign was we have what wow players want. However, this was only a little bit of the wow playerbase, enough to make Rift profitable, Gw2 could be great, but no raiding? it's purpose is to steal from wow's PvP playerbase. Starwars, Awesome questing! Take from wow's questers. Now it may be they are too afraid to actually invest a ton of money to not only match, but excel in every aspect of wow, but we are seeing what happens when you don't, Ea stock has dropped cause of star wars. there is a economic saying, for something to become competitive in the market, it needs to be 10x better. so far, nothing can pull that off.<br />
<br />
Guild Wars 2 isnt really going to need ''WoW style of raiding'' in its game, the whole game is based on Co-op/Group adventure, why add something if there is better stuff in there? no loot drama, no group horrors, no kicking, less irritation and you can play with whoever is available at the time you can and want to play rather than set times on the 3 same days a week and always waiting on those same 2 healers. the big difference between Guild wars 2 and the other MMo's is the fact that GW1 was already a big competition for WoW at the time of its peak (6 mil players worldwide), while games like Rift, SWTOR or w/e MMO that cant be really original , had to start from scratch. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaleredar</div><div class="date">2012-01-22, 10:27 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The problem with this view is, in my opinion, twofold. <br />
<br />
First, there is pretty obviously going to be even less choice with the new MoP system than the &quot;anything beyond a few points deviation&quot; you mention. I played a discipline priest, and I had a number of real choices to make on talents involving prioritizing survivability, mana management, raid vs. tank healing, and even completely different play styles with talents like atonement and archangel. And that's not even getting into pvp builds for arena or bg healing, which are very different from the PvE builds. The 'choices' presented by the new system are basically cosmetic. At best, with the new system I'm going to be losing a few choices of abilities and a fair amount of flexibility. <br />
<br />
Buy hey, maybe I'm worrying too much about details. After all, beta isn't even out yet, right? Nothing is finalized. And that brings us to what I think is going to be the second problem with the MoP talents. Blizzard is rebuilding the whole talent system from scratch. This is the same team that wrecked entire specs with the initial Cataclysm changes, and arguably hasn't gotten some things fixed well over a year later. And now the same crew is re-creating the whole thing from the ground up? And people honestly think this is a good idea?<br />
<br />
It's like letting your mechanically disinclined little brother take your car on a road trip, and when he brings it back with what are obviously a few mechanical problems, telling him to just take it all apart and put it back together. After all, what could possibly go wrong?<br />
<br />
I do have to admit, the more I read about the new talent scheme, the more tempted I am to resub for 5.0, just to watch the inevitable hilarity. I expect it's going to make Ret Pallys in 3.0 look like a walk in the park. XD<br />
<br />
Well, let me show you how I (must) roll from a DPS perspective. <br />
<br />
I am a frost DK. Dual-wield, to be precise. My talent spec is and MUST BE a base 4/29/3. That gives me a scant few talent points to drop wherever I'd like. (or, more precisely, in the few remaining available talents that would actually do anything at all)<br />
<br />
Now, I can tell you... None of these extra talent points really mean much of ANYTHING in the way of actual choice or major impact on my priority if I choose to drop them into one of two slight &quot;deviations.&quot; None of them change it in a &quot;Cool, meaningful, unique fashion&quot; that makes me feel like a special little Deathknight butterfly. If anything, they give you just an edgewise of fudge room on it. It comes down to you &quot;picking&quot; which minor way you chose to make your priority flow a little bit more smoothly, with the choices giving you same result in the end. 41 talent points boil down into &quot;do you want diseases to last longer, therefore meaning you can spend runes on other attacks, or do you want to be able to use blood tap more often to open up runes instead?&quot; Certainly a &quot;harrowing&quot; decision... that elitist jerks told me about. Just oodles of fun, right? So it's either &quot;push your regular buttons, or instead push this other button slightly more often.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, with this new talent tree, I actually get to PICK abilities (for the most part. Some are more practical for frost DKs than others on their tier) that will have a meaningful impact on individual dungeon/raid encounters, instead of being bottle-necked into essential abilities with the remaining points used to... well, accomplish the same thing no matter what I do with them, after being told by elitist jerks what I need to do with all the other ones.</div></div><hr />

People are ceasing to subscribe because they’re bored. It’s even worse now that the LFR means people get to clear a top tier raid for a few weeks, get some gear, then have nothing to do. Blizzard’s killed progressional content as soon as they had gear resets every patch to ferry everyone in to the newest raid to bump consumption numbers that no-one cares about. There’s nothing for these people to better themselves for. There’s no long term goals to hold their interest.<br />
<br />
And really, when you start to treat an MMO with instant gratification in mind, what do you really expect?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly. It's just boring and that's all. <br />
As long as you can progress (meaningfull progress) you are fine. When you get stuck because there is a cap and you cleared everything within a week you have a problem. Thinking that hardmodes will keep the 'hardcore' crowd playing is a big mistake. The magic of this game was for most people the progression and now there is barely any left. It has to take time to progress otherwise it feels boring. And it has to get more difficult over time.<br />
<br />
<br />
And dont think that all the subscriber losses are because of content quality or the reasons YOU propagade. There are much simpler reasons available. - Your guild disbanded and you just have enough of it. - You dont have time anymore. - You just dont wanna play anymore, not because it's bad, but because it's been enough now. - You are through with actual content and put your account to rest, until MoP comes out. To note some. <br />

The current System has much more choices than the silly talent system you are working on ... especially since you take really unique choices away from us. As Enhancement I can decide to spec into Enhancement, take some talents from Elemental or even going an unorthodox way and go for survivability and go Enhancement Restoration - for pvp e.g. ... the new system screws all that. In fact you are taking away key elements of enhancement and give that to Elemental and Resto and at the same time you take away all the heals but healing surge and healing rain from enhancement ... funny that you say this is an improvement to the curent state of the talent system. If I hadn't ordered annual pass already I'd cancel it since you are clearly out of touch with your game ( I mean the player base) the subscription numbers say all and if you push this through you will lose even more. It is bad enough that you want us to &quot;sink our teeth&quot; into the current content all the time to MOP with 0 updates ... I mean mop is not even in FF ALPHA ... so we are talking about 4-6 months here ... or 84€ in monthly fees for nothing. Can't wait for Wildstar.<br />

<br />
<br />
League of Legends is pretty popular stuff, but just how popular might surprise you. More than four million people play the game every day, a jump of 280 percent since July, and with 11.5 million monthly active players it's now officially bigger than World of Warcraft, which slipped to 10.3 million users from the beginning of July to the end of September.<br />
<br />
And now this is coming aswell:<br />
<br />
<br />
Riot Games revealed these numbers in advance of the upcoming League of Legends: Season Two, which will have a $5 million prize pool up for grabs and finish with a $2 million tournament featuring the best League of Legends teams in the world. &quot;The incredible passion and dedication of our players is positively inspiring,&quot; said Riot Games co-founder and CEO Brandon Beck. &quot;Our community's boundless enthusiasm is why they are central to every decision we make at Riot.&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilian</div><div class="date">2012-01-22, 02:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, let me show you how I (must) roll from a DPS perspective. <br />
<br />
I am a frost DK. Dual-wield, to be precise. My talent spec is and MUST BE a base 4/29/3. That gives me a scant few talent points to drop wherever I'd like. (or, more precisely, in the few remaining available talents that would actually do anything at all)<br />
<br />
Now, I can tell you... None of these extra talent points really mean much of ANYTHING in the way of actual choice or major impact on my priority if I choose to drop them into one of two slight &quot;deviations.&quot; None of them change it in a &quot;Cool, meaningful, unique fashion&quot; that makes me feel like a special little Deathknight butterfly. If anything, they give you just an edgewise of fudge room on it. It comes down to you &quot;picking&quot; which minor way you chose to make your priority flow a little bit more smoothly, with the choices giving you same result in the end. 41 talent points boil down into &quot;do you want diseases to last longer, therefore meaning you can spend runes on other attacks, or do you want to be able to use blood tap more often to open up runes instead?&quot; Certainly a &quot;harrowing&quot; decision... that elitist jerks told me about. Just oodles of fun, right? So it's either &quot;push your regular buttons, or instead push this other button slightly more often.&quot;<br />
<br />
Now, with this new talent tree, I actually get to PICK abilities (for the most part. Some are more practical for frost DKs than others on their tier) that will have a meaningful impact on individual dungeon/raid encounters, instead of being bottle-necked into essential abilities with the remaining points used to... well, accomplish the same thing no matter what I do with them, after being told by elitist jerks what I need to do with all the other ones.<br />
<br />
You really think those talents have a meaningful impact? With dungeons being all AoE and LFR and normal raids being extremely easy and with so many players with all having an insane amount of buffs/debuffs/CC/etc in your group do you really think that you being able to CC or slow a mob a little different than when you choose another talent will matter? Trust me no one will notice what talents you have chosen, they will not care because it simply doesn't matter.<br />
And not everyone is going to check EJ for an optimal spec because most players realise they don't need an optimal spec. It's not Vanilla or TBC anymore where choosing one talent wrong had a decent impact on the outcome of an encounter. The only time it really matters is in high end PvP or in Hardmodes which apparently almost no one does.<br />
Talents are there to feel that you progress and that you are making your character stronger or you can see them as a reward for leveling up. Not every talent has to be meaningfull or cool or make you feel special.<br />
<br />
You should have choices of how you will create your character, how you make him/her stronger. Taken them away makes the game boring and nothing else.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I have to say the comments on MMO-Champion are getting pretty overwhelming. People are not happy with Blizzard making things extremely easy and streamlining the game. First people were waiting to see what would happen and most defended Blizzards choices and now most are just unhappy and see what is wrong with Blizzards design approach. Subscriber numbers also show that they are going the wrong way. You can try to blame other things but it's just really simple, they made the choice to make this game extremely accessible and easy and it's not working out for them.</div></div><hr />

Thank about it why spend $$ to pump out content every 3 months when you have no real Competition. Rift have under 1m subs but they pump out more content in 6 mouths then WoW dose in a hole year. Blizz do not care as long as 8+ mill people keep giving them $15 a month. People there are new MMOs out there like ToR and soon GW2 and The Secret World. As long as wow keeps killing new MMOs WoW is not going to change.</div></div><hr />

The new talent system seems way better, I like the fact they forcing you into a correct spec I for one hate gimped retarded groups coz 1 or 2 people can't figure out how to spec right and pull retarded dps or the tank breaks in half or the healer goes oom instantly, at least now we will know its the player and not the terrible choice in speccing.<br />
<br />
They will still suck no matter what. If you can't make a half decent spec then you definitely are not going to pull reasonable dps or tank or heal properly. Also in this game how things are now you are never going to learn as a new player because it doesn't matter anymore if your dps is 1/3 of what it should be or you lose agro as a tank or you let 2 out of 5 players die in your group.<br />
<br />
They are better of needing to choose and find out for themselves and bad choices having a real impact on their game instead of Blizzard holding their hands. Maybe they will actually become better players then.<br />
At least when I make a mistake and other people are being punished (not only me) for those mistakes then I am definitely going to improve.<br />

You are the one that should get a clue. You had ~3-4 talent points that werent set in stone because what you chose with them was irrelevant anyway.<br />
<br />
And the choices you get now are also irrelevant.</div></div><hr />

But the hardcores were happy. Then Blizz panicked at the subscription drop and nerfed everything to the ground. The casuals were already pissed off and continued to leave, and now the hardcores were angry and quitting too. Blizz needs to choose one audience to cater to and stick with it. That way maybe they can halt the slide in subs, and the non-catered to crowd will know to find another game.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Raunchy</div><div class="date">2012-01-22, 09:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You are wrong. Sorry to sound arrogant, but this is not my opinion. This is a fact. Why? Let's explain it in easy words.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard is a company. The main thing which drives a company is not profit, it is maximizing profit.<br />
<br />
WoW's sudden drop in subscription numbers directly impact the companies financial situation.<br />
<br />
WoW's subscription numbers can be influenced in a lot of ways. It can range from the added competition in the MMO Market (SW:TOR for example), customer dissatisfaction (Game Design for example) or just natural causes (EVERY product has the same life cycle. Once it reaches it's peak, it will drop slowly). Mind you, there are far more factors.<br />
<br />
Blizzard can address this in a variety of ways. Like for example investing more money into marketing, which is highly illogical at this stage. If Blizzard thinks the main reason of people canceling their subscriptions due to customer dissatisfaction with their product, they may have to rethink their game design philosophy (something you have experienced recently). However, it can become much worse. With a dropping budget, Blizzard may address to the ever-dropping budget in a variety ways, from sacking employees (Less GM's, Less Artists and etc.) to just restricting the content created (Less money to spend means less work on raids, instances and etc.)<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, an opposite thing may happen. Even though they generate less revenue, Blizzard may invest more money into producing higher-quality content, which may return their old customers and attract new ones.<br />
<br />
In conclusion, Blizzards financial situation DOES impact you, either you like it or not.<br />
<br />
Haha I wish they were doing that last method.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I guess people play for different reasons, but your friends joining when they made the heroics wotlk faceroll again is not indicative of the subscription losses.<br />
<br />
<br />
cataclysm lost subscriptions because they hyped it out of proportion and it should have never sold as many copies as it did<br />
<br />
when players realized that cataclysm was inflated hype by 4.1 and they cancelled the raid, players cancelled their subscriptions.<br />
<br />
it was cool playing a new race for a little bit, seeing a few new quests, goblin starting area. this excitement lasted me a week or two. then I settled into the familiar grind for epics (dragonmaw reputation?) for 1 pair of epic boots, another rep grind with tol'vir for a belt.<br />
<br />
major things that drove people away weren't &quot;content too hard&quot; but things like dumbing down of talent trees, silly rep grind for 1 item, men community of trolls, blizzard insulting their customers in forums with sarcastic remarks and &quot;its out game, like it or quit&quot;<br />
<br />
I don't care if you friends came back or why, that has nothing to do with 2 million people quitting.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tydrane</div><div class="date">2012-01-23, 12:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I ultimately wouldn't be surprised if the game lost more subs given that our concluding, final role in it was tearing off some armour from Deathwing so Thrall could shoot him down and save the day, and then fight Deathwing's fingernails so that Thrall can once again, shoot him and save the day. Nobody wants to be 'the help'. Even if Tirion helped us in ICC with a mass ress, we still did all the heavy lifting when it came to finishing the Lich King fight. Even if the Blue Dragons helped us with Kil'jaeden, we still did all the hard work. And so on and so forth, but helping Blizzard's favourite Mary-Sue save the day was not what I had in mind when I bought Cataclysm; I imagined fighting Deathwing in his human form (which was resigned to some dumb Badlands quests), and then in a Shadow of the Colossus-esque fashion, fighting our away across Deathwing's body and bringing him down, perhaps some manner of legendary sword being thrust into his head as he flew around on his path of terror and destruction in a King Arthur fashion.<br />
<br />
Instead we got a boss that we hardly ever saw, save for being a general inconvenience when he burned zones; 99% of the Deathwing we saw this expansion was simply the aftermath of Deathwing, and i'd take the Lich King, who made a point of checking up on his future Scourge champions, over that any day.I'm sure people have their own reasons for quitting, but for those with a lore inclination that's likely one of them.<br />
This guy gets it.<br />
<br />
I liked that WotLK played almost as a single-player game that you could play with friends, kinda like a co-op mode. The story was tailored to make your actions, through completing quests, drive the story forward. It was a little insulting to be relegated to the role of &quot;Malfurion's minion&quot;, or &quot;Harrison Jones' sidekick&quot;; and while you did all the mindless busywork, they'd swing in at the last moment and cap things off in a cut-sequence. I never did the Dragon Soul raid, but I can imagine being &quot;Thrall's furniture&quot; would be much the same.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I gotta be honest, I played SWOTR over the last few weeks but nothing hardcore. The game just didn't do it for me. Until I tweaked the ini settings the graphics were very dull. The engine feels old and clunky. The PVE side of it is okay but I hate the cutscenes. The game definitely feels rushed but what is the final nail in the coffin for me is that Warhammer devs have a hand in SWOTR pvp which is a hot mess right now. That alone nullifies any potential for the game in my eyes. They could very well turn things around but I'm not optimistic. I regret to say that I will probably be back for MOP to check it out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kaleredar</div><div class="date">2012-01-23, 07:36 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">You really think those talents have a meaningful impact?

<br />
You should have choices of how you will create your character, how you make him/her stronger. Taken them away makes the game boring and nothing else.<br />
.<br />
<br />
With that mindset, Blizzard is only treading water, because the scant few points many talent trees are left with sure as hell don't matter now. And these new talents actually LET you choose how to make your character stronger. So instead of having to take Lichborne to free myself from fears (which no PvE frost DK would do currently anyway, as it would be wasted talent points) I could choose anti-magic bubble to help mitigate raid damage during a fight like Zon'ozz or a similar burst AOE heavy fight. <br />
<br />
The only alternative is if Talents actually let you choose abilities that actually changed your rotation. Unfortunately, this would be a nightmare to balance and, ultimately, pointless, as one cookie-cutter spec would arise anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
Talents are there to feel that you progress and that you are making your character stronger or you can see them as a reward for leveling up. Not every talent has to be meaningfull or cool or make you feel special. <br />
<br />
I find this statement to be rather contradictory. You're basically saying &quot;you want your character to feel cool while you're leveling and getting more powerful, so we shouldn't give them abilities that make them feel cool or more powerful when leveling, and instead give them flat crit increases&quot;</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Thuran</div><div class="date">2012-01-23, 09:19 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Guess they need some sort of &quot;proof&quot; that the &quot;game is dying&quot; or something like that.<br />
<br />
Even if WoW loses half it's subscribers, I can bet that it's still the game with the most subscribers.<br />
<br />
I'll take you up on that bet, considering that WoW in NOWHERE near the game with the most.<br />
<br />
In Q 3, LoL had 15 million players, more than wow ever reached, even in it's prime.<br />
Currently, minecraft had over 20 million players, a number WoW is never going to get close to, in fact, by these numbers, unless 4.3 was a big turnaround, wow barely has half the number of players that minecraft has. <br />
<br />
Wow is about to face more than 6 months of NOTHING happening, so it's subs will keep dropping, and we will no doubt see the subscriber loss pick up speed in Q1 and Q2 2012, the real question is whether MoP can turn the game around, or be the final nail in it's coffin and force it down to the level of &quot;any other mmo&quot;.<br />
<br />
Why do subscriber losses matter to the player though? Because the more people they lose, the more money they lose, the higher risk of them being fired from their jobs, and the more chance that blizzard will pull it's act together and recognise that the current direction of the game is wrong and take a good, hard, look at what works and what doesn't work. In short: Loss of players makes the game better.<br />
<br />
<br />
Oh, and to put the numbers into perspective: 2 million out of 12 million means that one in every 6 players has left, while you may want this to sound like &quot;a drop in the ocean&quot;, it is in fact a rather huge dropoff, and what is worse is that since the playerbase is split across servers, the remaining 10 million don't have acces to each other, as as server populations dwindle and people have fewer to play with, they will in turn have less incentive to play the game. Lets assume a quarter (1 million players more from now) of the people in your guild left, your guild would not be in a great position would it? Now assume that you cannot fill those empty spots, and thus not do whatever your guild does, this causes a few more to leave, making it even harder to find people and in turn adding to the feeling that the server/guild is dead and there is no point in sticking around.<br />
<br />
So, in considering a number's drop, you must also keep in mind that losing subs causes you to lose more subs and so it is likely that we will see sub loses increase exponentially, with drops every Q that includes a patch, until we get to a point where it his the minimum subs number (which allowed MMO's like AoC to survive long enough to start growing again, there will always be a minimum of players playing a game due to niche interests, just like shitty movies have a following SOMEWHERE). <br />
<br />
Also, in saying Numbers = Quality of a game, well, Transformers 1,2,3 made more money than other movies, hell, twilight made more money than most other movies, would you say this means that those are good movies? No! They are in every aspect plain bad movies, but easily marketable and easily digestible movies, even if they are plain worse from a quality standpoint. Hell, by this philosophy Avatar is the single best movie ever produced in the history of cinema, and if you think that holds true I got a few movies you need to see....</div></div><hr />

Ghostcrawler's current cynical attitude has been forged by years of dealing with whiny, belligerent, and paranoid WoW players insisting that the franchise he is working on is dying for the most petty, asinine reasons imaginable. Years of dealing with that crap takes its toll. I'm surprised the man isn't a basket case, roaming around the servers and smiting people at random. <br />

LOL another post you couldn't be more wrong in, and I like how you defend blizzard and take blizzard's stance and blame the players of being &quot;whiny, belligerent, and paranoid&quot;. yeah, I see right through you. you clearly work at blizzard.<br />
<br />
the activision/blizzard merge was announced in 2007, wotlk and ulduar were already finished, waiting to be released, all the content since then has been short, simple, dumbed down and catering to casuals.<br />
<br />
look at activision's history with games, everything they becoming involved with going down the drain. wow was gold in TBC, turned to crap when activision-blizzard got greedy and decided they wanted the farmville market. they made the game short and simple, alienating their loyal &quot;hardcore&quot; players who some to this day hope the next patch will fix everything. look at the big picture and the direction the game has gone and is going in MOP. what leads you to believe anything will change direction or get better?<br />
<br />
its all about money now. content costs money. its a subscription game, so you only need someone playing 1 day a month, paying subscription, rather than 12 hrs a day, 30 days a month, that costs server time, and new content because players have played the current content too much. if only they could get casuals to play 1 hour a day, they would only need new content every 6 months.... profitable.<br />
<br />
I'll let you go type another misguided and nonsense post that shows you clearly have no clue what you're talking about now.<br />
<br />
btw, nice sig, keep dreaming.<br />
<br />
google: &quot;wow new models excuse&quot;<br />
<br />
blizzard has been giving players the excuse they wouldn't make new models becaue players were attached to their current models, LOL<br />
<br />
your sig is a response to that, they can't use that excuse anymore because players are giving up on on that hope. so now they're lying to players. they won't add new models, unless its the major highlight of a store bought expansion.<br />
<br />
they haven't updated new models for years saying &quot;players like current models, we don't want them to quit&quot; right, and thats why they say &quot;We won't use that as an excuse (anymore)&quot; though they won't admit they used it as an excuse for years, and that's why that post in the google search was deleted.<br />
<br />
more deception from blizzard and you. your posts are completely ridiculous. stop lying to players...</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has at least expressed their acknowledgement of the failures of Cataclysm... Slow content delivery, players confined to waiting in cities, lack of world PvP... We know remarkably little about MoP so far <br />

I fail to see what this has to do with... anything, really. Have you personally asked blizzard if they themselves actually deny ever not wanting to make new models? Besides, if it could potentially come down to alienating players (something you clearly feel shouldn't be risked at all,) wouldn't it have been right within Blizzard's MO to NOT make them for that very reason? <br />

<br />
your posts lack truth and substance. all you have is insulting and blaming players, and making stupid quotes.<br />
<br />
I don't care that you work for blizzard and post in their favor on these forums, neither does anyone else. players have spoken with their subscriptions.<br />
<br />
yes, blizzard admitted cataclysm was a failure, but they maintained it was hugely successful until they lost 2 million subscribers. its impossible to maintain that lie when numbers spoke for themselves. the ONLY reason blizzard admitted cataclysm was a failure was so they could hype MOP by contrast saying &quot;we did this wrong in cataclysm, but we're fixing it in MOP&quot; yeah right, with pandas and pokemon? how does that fix serious issues like lack of raid content, unbalanced pvp for years, dumbing down of talent trees (MOP further dumbs down talent trees)<br />
<br />
I look at the direction, I see blizzard say &quot;we're fixing it&quot; and see further simplification of talent trees from 51 pts to 41 pts, to how many in MOP?<br />
<br />
players like choice, they've expressed this, they also like content. blizzard likes money and content costs money, so after they promise and hype it to sell box copies, they cancel their promises.<br />
<br />
seriously, you are a liar, like I said, I see right through your BS. you are just as bad as blizzard. players speak with subscriptions, your words fall on deaf ears. put that in your fail quote, because all your posts are fail quotes to me.<br />
<br />
your agenda is the same as blizzard's preaching the integrity of the game while actions show otherwise, you lie left and right, and like blizzard, you insult players who are still paying for the game (otherwise they couldn't post on blizzard's forums)<br />
<br />
you laugh in player's faces, spit on them, call them paranoid and whiny, lie to them, and you expect them to believe any nonsense you spew in your lies?<br />
<br />
you are a joke just as wow and blizzard are a joke. quite pathetic really. welcome to ignore loser.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm digging the character attacks, I really am. What's MMO champions stance on those, again...<br />
<br />
Anyway, boiling down down your post to actual points of debate:<br />
<br />
<br />
Its impossible to maintain that lie when numbers spoke for themselves. the ONLY reason blizzard admitted cataclysm was a failure was so they could hype MOP by contrast saying &quot;we did this wrong in cataclysm, but we're fixing it in MOP&quot; yeah right, with pandas and pokemon? how does that fix serious issues like lack of raid content, unbalanced pvp for years, dumbing down of talent trees (MOP further dumbs down talent trees)<br />
<br />
First off, Cataclysm was the fastest selling PC game of all time. In the early months of Cataclysm, it would have made quite a bit of sense to indeed gauge that as a success. Now, what would be really nice would be to have numbers that gauge when exactly subscriptions started going south... Whether that started during the first raiding tier of Cataclysm (which I doubt somewhat) or instead during the massive lull in content during patch 4.1 (which I find more likely.) <br />
<br />
The &quot;Pandas&quot; and &quot;pokemon&quot; points you make are irrelevant. It's been said a thousand times over, but perhaps reiterating it to others once more will help, as you've conceded the argument. Pandaren are an established Warcraft species, who have been asked for as a race since, as you say, the &quot;golden&quot; Burning Crusade. Now, people might claim that Pandaren have &quot;no backstory&quot; and are having their lore &quot;made up on the spot...&quot; This is remarkably similar to another race... oh, what race was it... oh yes, the Draenei, which apparently did not serve to mar the Burning Crusade even with all their previous lore either being made up on the fly or heavily retconned, and with said retconned and made up lore being a major part of the story. As for the &quot;pokemon,&quot; players complain about not having enough to do during end game. This gives them something to do. You and others seem to make the assumption that the pet battles are a labor-intensive feat of programming that will require constant input from the departments of the game that develop and balance raids and PvP. I'm not entirely sure where this assumption comes from.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
That's really no excuse, and it'd only have any basis in fact if Ghostcrawler didn't treat respectful, polite suggestions, complaints and requests with the same utter contempt as the trolls. In a thread where several people have well-articulated posts that went against his position, he chooses the one troll in the thread and replies to their post, ignoring all others, treating everybody as though they had been as rude and pugilistic as that one nasty player.<br />
<br />
As an employee of Blizzard, he represents the company. His conduct reflects on the company. When he feels like it, he is also a form of liaison that players can try to contact to get information or feedback on their own suggestions. Picking fights that you know you can win does not represent Blizzard well. Repaying politeness and decency with wilful ignorance does not represent Blizzard well. If he has nothing nice to say, or no nice way to say it, perhaps he should remove himself from the forums and relay all his messages with someone who can present them with the slightest modicum of respect.</div></div><hr />

I dont care what the excuse is. It has no place in a business enviroment period. Tseric left when it got too hot, and he was far, far better at handling it than Ghostcrawler. The man rode the coattails of better designers and has destroyed the game simply put. Can him and you'll see subs pick up.<br />
<br />
Another thing would be to stop making cool stuff for the Card game that few if any play. Blizzard IS NOT Wizards of the Coast. They need to start focusing on WoW. Not the damned subsidies. It pisses me off when I see &quot;Only for TCG&quot; or &quot;Comic story conclusion.&quot; Make the damn game or dont.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">woosheee</div><div class="date">2012-01-24, 04:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, Cataclysm was the fastest selling PC game of all time.

<br />
I don't really want to get involved in a debate, but I just wanted to point out that Cataclysm sold a lot of copies based on what was revealed at Blizzcon. Since Cataclysm's release, subscriptions have been declining steadily. It looks as if people bought Cataclysm based on the previewed content, then content like path of titans and abyssal maw were junked, and patch 4.1 (I think, the one that became ZA and ZG out of no where) was delayed for months?<br />
<br />
I think players bought Cataclysm and were disappointed, and Blizzard acknowledged this disappointment, calling the expansion a &quot;failure&quot; as you admitted. I think it was a failure too. So everyone agrees. Why would MOP be any better? Cataclysm looked *really* good, then it was a failure.<br />
<br />
Well just my two cents. I don't think bragging about selling copies then 1.7 million people quit the entire game is a smart idea. 14% of everyone that played wow quit in Cataclysm? They were so excited before release. Now a lot of people hate mists of pandaran, little new content, no real theme or developed bad guy character, pokemon, these people aren't excited about this expansion and last expansion they were and like 1/7 of the players quit. Just saying, not a good sign. Seems as if the expansion isnt as good as players are led to believe = disappointed players quitting.<br />
<br />
also I dont see how they will maintain their customers with no content until MOP comes out? 1/7 of the playerbase quit during Cataclysm, with content patches, more will quit without content patches before MOP.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gilian</div><div class="date">2012-01-26, 10:31 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I find this statement to be rather contradictory. You're basically saying &quot;you want your character to feel cool while you're leveling and getting more powerful, so we shouldn't give them abilities that make them feel cool or more powerful when leveling, and instead give them flat crit increases&quot;<br />
<br />
I'm sorry I guess I missed it where they gave us cool stuff to choose from. The only thing they are doing is taking choices away from us. I rather choose between a flat crit buff or a flat str buff instead of nothing at all.<br />
Also choosing between three dps cooldowns which are practically all the same isn't 'cool'. Or choosing between three snares which in the end all have the same result isn't 'cool' either.<br />
<br />
I don't understand why people defend this dumbing down. The only thing they do is take away all talents so Blizzard has an even easier time to balance classes. Are you really that lazy to look at your talents and pick a few? And a new player gets everything automatically. You don't have to choose between options, you don't have to find the entrance of a dungeon, you don't have to find anything at all. It's just level and queue and when you need something it is right in front of your face, you can't miss it. No need to use your brain. I guess only very stupid people or 12 year olds can enjoy that.<br />
And to be clear that has nothing to do with accessibility. They are only catering to stupid people.<br />
<br />
<br />
With that mindset, Blizzard is only treading water, because the scant few points many talent trees are left with sure as hell don't matter now. And these new talents actually LET you choose how to make your character stronger. So instead of having to take Lichborne to free myself from fears (which no PvE frost DK would do currently anyway, as it would be wasted talent points) I could choose anti-magic bubble to help mitigate raid damage during a fight like Zon'ozz or a similar burst AOE heavy fight.<br />
<br />
The only alternative is if Talents actually let you choose abilities that actually changed your rotation. Unfortunately, this would be a nightmare to balance and, ultimately, pointless, as one cookie-cutter spec would arise anyway.<br />
<br />
<br />
I don't see the difference. It is either you choose between three CD's or snares that are practically the same or you choose between lichborne or anti-magic zone which is no choice except that one is maybe better for PvP. Your choices are exactly the same as the ones we got now except you have a lot less choices. <br />
Because Blizzard says these choices are more fun doesn't automatically mean they are.</div></div><hr />
