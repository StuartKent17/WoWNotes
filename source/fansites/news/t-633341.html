Upcoming Class Change Highlights (Part 1)<br />
We are planning a lot of exciting content for patch 3.1.0, and we are doing a three-part preview series on upcoming class changes. This is the first in the series: Priests, Rogues, and Shaman. Please keep in mind, that this list is not at all comprehensive, and subject to change.<br />

Divine Spirit – this spell is now a core ability available to all priests.<br />
Discipline has access to a new talent, Power Word: Barrier. (Think of it as Power Word: Shield for your whole group).<br />
Several area of effect (AOE) heal spells have been improved: Prayer of Healing can be cast on any groups in your raid party. Holy Nova’s mana cost has been reduced. Circle of Healing now heals for more.<br />
Shadow priest PvP survivability has been improved: Shadow Form now reduces magic as well as physical damage. Dispersion now removes snares.<br />
Penance – this spell can now be targeted on the priest.<br />
Serendipity – this talent now reduces the cast time of Greater Heal and Prayer of Healing when Binding Heal or Flash Heal are cast.<br />
We are also working to give Holy additional PvP utility.<br />
<br />

Hunger for Blood – instead of a self-buff, this ability can only be used when there is a bleed effect on the target. However, it has no stacks and grants a 15% damage bonus.<br />
Adrenaline Rush – the cooldown on this ability has been lowered.<br />
Lightning Reflexes – reduced to 3 ranks. In addition to 2/4/6% dodge, this talent now also grants 4/7/10% passive melee haste.<br />
Killing Spree – while this ability is active, the rogue does 20% additional damage.<br />
Savage Combat – now causes 2/4% physical damage done.<br />
Mace Specialization – this talent now grants haste in addition to armor penetration.<br />
<br />

Chain Lightning – now jumps to 4 targets but does less damage. We wanted to make the distinction between Lightning Bolt and Chain Lightning more clear.<br />
Storm, Earth and Fire – this talent now increases all damage done by Flame Shock, not just periodic damage.<br />
Spirit Weapons – now reduces all threat, not just melee threat.<br />
Unleashed Rage – reduced to 2 ranks, now also increases your critical strike chance with melee attacks by 1/2%.<br />
Totem streamlining: The Mana Spring and Healing Stream Totems have been combined. The Disease Cleansing and Poison Cleansing Totems have been combined.<br />

Blue posts<br />
Interesting blue posts are starting to appear... 3.1.0 release on PTRs is probably closer than ever! Please note that there is a slight issue with the blue tracker and I'll just link the official forums for today. The blue tracker should be fixed within the day. (And most likely before any other announcement comes up)<br />
Differences between classes DPS in raid<br />
There is no such thing as a typical raid or even a typical encounter, so it is tricky to make blanket statements like &quot;X always tops the meters.&quot; Overall, we suspect that warriors are too high (largely on double-dipping effects of Deep Wounds), DKs may be too high, and rogues and possibly cats are too low. This should not be news to anyone who follows these forums.<br />
<br />
Again, that depends enormously on your actual group. Players are often very quick to ignore differences in gear or skill when claiming their dps is too low. We tend to balance around individual encounters though. There might be certain fights where we think say mages, hunters or shamans are too high depending on how that encounter plays out. I would not try and read too much into my statements above. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910421492&amp;pageNo=5#97))<br />
<br />
[...] When we say &quot;pure dps classes should generally top the meters&quot; we mean &quot;warlocks, hunters, mages and rogues.&quot; However, when we say &quot;generally top the meters&quot; we are refering to players of flawless skill and perfect gear. For almost all raids composed of mortals, a very good player of any dps spec should be able to do the highest damage on an encounter. This was not the case in BC where we kept say Enhancement shamans or Retribution paladins much lower than the pure classes. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910421492&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=8#158))<br />
<br />
Dual Talent Spec<br />
This is still in the works and we will have more information on it for everyone before too much longer. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910061835&amp;pageNo=1#2))<br />
<br />
Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Sapphiron - Aura bugged / not affected by Frost resist?<br />
We've made no explicit changes to the encounter on the design side to change how the frost aura works. When Sapphiron enters combat, he casts a spell on himself that every 2 seconds casts the debuff players receive, which you see as &quot;Frost Aura&quot;. That debuff is a 5 second duration damage over time effect that deals frost damage every second. The only difference between the 10 and 25 player versions of these spells is the amount of damage.<br />
<br />
So if you were only getting damaged every 2 seconds previously in a 10 player raid, and still are only getting damaged every 2 seconds in a 25 player raid, there's some kind of odd bug going on that I'll have to track down. Especially since the data says you should be taking damage every second. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14697621780&amp;pageNo=6#108))<br />
<br />
Once we find out what he bug is and correct the problem, we'll adjust the numbers if needed to closely match the damage that players have been experiencing when WotLK shipped. We're not trying to adjust the difficulty of this fight, but we need to determine what's happening so this bug doesn't cause problems with future encounters.

Malygos - bugs in 3.0.8<br />
We're checking into the various issues noted here, including why his cone breath hits targets behind his centerpoint, issues with malygos deciding to attack in phase 2, and trying to make the defense bubble's protection work even if you enter the bubble in between the time a missile is launched and when it lands.

<br />
Malygos - Feign Death not working is &quot;intended&quot;<br />
Feign death not working in actually intentional, but certainly not desired. It was causing a very nasty problem, and we've been trying to figure out a way to handle the particular boundary case without setting the creature flag that ignores feign death.

<br />
Itemization Q&amp;A (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910131331&amp;pageNo=1#7))<br />
1.) Why homogenize gear so much? Although I could understand the hassle when something like plate aster gear drops and there's no pally, but when you standardize things like stamina and armor, classes that depend on them take a hit.<br />
You answered your own question here. Nobody was going to be happy when the Feral tanking armor or Frost DK plate started to drop except maybe 2 out of 30 specs. <br />
<br />
2.) What's with the need for &quot;all specs being viable for everything&quot;? I was perfectly fine with builds that were preferred for PvP and others for PvE, it was how a player was defined (like if they were a raider, or a PvPer). Not only that, now you have to balance every spec to each other (as if balancing wasn't hard enough). <br />
Among other things, we thought it was shallow that every raider of a class had the same spec and every Gladiator of a class had the same spec. For dps classes, that also tended to lead to the PvE spec, the PvP spec and the pointless spec. For classes with very different roles per tree (like shamans) it doesn't make sense at all to have a PvP spec. So Resto shamans are only for PvP? <br />
<br />
3.) PvE gear vs. PvP gear. There's nothing that differentiates them besides 2 stats. Hit and resilience. When I switch over to my PvE gear, I lose a whopping 1k HP. 1k. That's barely anything. Why can't PvP gear and PvE gear be more specialized for those purposes so classes that aren't as reliant on resilience don't get a one-up on others like at the beginning of this season? Also, Naxx 25 raiding is so retard friendly that the best PvE 2 hander in the game is about as easy to get as one piece of savage while the Deadly weapons are almost unreachable. <br />
If you compare a PvE and PvP piece of the same item level, the PvP piece has more resilience and pays for it by having its other stats lower. This wasn't necessarily the case in BC when resilience was more of a free bonus stat.<br />
<br />
The PvE gear is currently pretty easy to get, but we think that is actually a fine place to be after BC where anyone could get Arena &quot;welfare&quot; epics and raiding scared off a lot of people. The PvP gear in LK isn't all that hard to get either when you consider that you can spend badges or get lucky on Archavon. If we could do it over again, though, we probably would have started the Arena season earlier (or at least let some of the Honor gear be attainable) so that there wasn't so much high level PvE gear relative to PvP gear floating around.<br />
<br />
The Ulduar gear, especially the better weapons, will be harder to get, just like the new season of gladiator gear will be harder to get. <br />

Ebon Plague / Unholy Blight<br />
Can you make Unholy Blight a disease again and Ebon Plague a magical effect?<br />
Not all Unholy DKs pick up Unholy Blight though. One of the benefits of Ebon Plague is it just happens without having to spend that extra GCD. We'll get it fixed.<br />
<br />
We also agree that Plague Strike feels underwhelming. Part of the reason is that, unlike Icy Touch, it also has a pretty significant PvP effect in its ability to remove hots. We have some ideas to improve it though. We definitely don't want DKs to ever feel like the right way to play is to ignore one of their two main diseases. As some players have pointed out, there are a few reasons why that is the case.<br />
<br />
As a new class, I would expect to see a higher rate of change over time in the DK until they have caught up a little more with the 4+ year history of the other classes. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910130980&amp;pageNo=5#90))<br />

Explosive shot hotfixed and nerfed<br />
We made a hotfix recently to lower the coefficient of Explosive Shot. Sorry we didn't get a chance to announce the change ahead of time. We don't typically do patch notes for hotfixes so we don't have a system in place to always broadcast these before they happen.<br />
<br />
We are in the process of making some changes to get damage done more in parity (in PvP and PvE). If there are other classes far ahead of you on the damage meters, chances are good they will see some nerfs to their damage soon too.<br />
<br />
Overall, we are trying to make changes in a more timely manner so that players won't feel like they are stuck with a bug or other issue forever. We won't be able to get every issue fixed overnight, but it's a start. <br />
<br />
Ok where is the un nerf for BM then since you want to fix issues in a timely manner.<br />
Soon. I can't tell you a date, but it won't be long. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910001375&amp;pageNo=5#82))<br />
<br />
Developer Q&amp;A (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910131612&amp;pageNo=1#2))<br />
1. You said you are happy with the dps a MM hunter can pull. I have been playing in a competitive raid environment for 4 years and when I spec marks I fall 1000 dps behind ele shams, 800 dps behind the moonkin and 700 dps behind the arcane mages. We also then see you stating that you feel arcane mages are performing well in pve. Do your internal tests have MM hunters and arcane mages near each other or are we reading too much into what you are saying?<br />
What I said before was that players tend to look at relative numbers while we look at absolute numbers. All the players saying &quot;SV is not too high&quot; justify that by saying &quot;because I am not topping the meters.&quot; And in some cases, SV is topping the meters. <br />
<br />
You want all ferocity pets to feel viable in PVE but pets like wasps, wolves, tall striders and carrion birds have utility specials instead of damage specials. The only way I can see balancing the pets would be to give them 2 unique specials, one utility and one damage oriented. What ideas have been brainstormed at the table?<br />
There is a trade-off between damage and utility. We specifically gave some hunter pets raid buff / debuff options in case your group, esp. a 5 or 10-player group, has trouble having access to that bonus. I have seen a lot of wasps out there lately.<br />
<br />
But as I also said, more parity among pets is something we want to pursue. Currently most of the hunter discussions on the forums are about SV-MM-BM differences or PvP however. <br />
<br />
3. 41 point survival talent was due for a buff coming out of beta but we have seen no further discussion on it; last patch it even received a nerf! What are your plans for this? <br />
We hope to be able to announce some 3.1 changes soon.<br />
<br />
5. MM is still crippled by Chimera shots ~580 mana cost. Any chance we could see some arcane shot glyph inspired solutions to this? Possibly make rapid recuperation like shamanistic rage? <br />
We will be adding more glyphs over time, especially for newer abilities. We didn't want to add them all right away for fear that players would just assume the glyphed version of the spell was the way the spell worked rather than realizing what a benefit the glyph itself brought. If that makes sense. <br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/priest.jpg Priest (Skills List (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?page=640) / Talent + Glyph Calc. (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?priest))<br />
The Role of the Priest (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910221939&amp;pageNo=1#0))<br />
This is an experiment. One of the things that has confused me a little are all of the posts from players who say they don't understand the role of the priest class. It is unclear to us why there is so much confusion about this particular class, which seems to us to be fairly straightforward.<br />
<br />
We are often reluctant to lay out our design goals very clearly, because frankly some players tend to use those statements to attempt to lawyer us into changes (&quot;I'm supposed to be the master of AE damage&quot;) or would rather argue about the design instead of providing feedback on how the class actually works.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, because players have asked for it so often and in the interest of trying to foster the discussion, here is what we think of as the role of the priest class.<br />
<br />
The Role of the Priest <br />
The priest is a caster class that uses Holy and Shadow magic. Priests can only wear cloth armor and have a limited selection of weapons, but do most of their damage and healing from range. They make up for their low armor with spells that offer protection and healing.<br />
Discipline -- this is a healing tree that emphasizes survival and single-target healing. Discipline specializes in damage absorption and prevention rather than restoring health, although they are very capable in that department too.<br />
Holy -- this is a healing tree that has a spell suited for every situation. Holy priests can heal groups, heal individuals, heal tanks, or do all three in a single encounter. They are better at group healing than Discipline priests, but don't have as many damage prevention capabilities.<br />
Shadow -- this tree sacrifices healing for damage. Shadow priests can restore health and mana to their group while casting their spells. Like the Shadow damage of warlocks, Shadow priest damage tends towards drains and damage over time spells. <br />
<br />
Jack of all trades?<br />
I'm pretty sure &quot;jack of all trades, master of none&quot; is something the community came up with, not us. All I have ever said is you can't be &quot;jack of all trades, master of all.&quot; You can't be &quot;the best healer in the game.&quot; We have no problem if Disc priests can equal Holy paladins or if Holy priests can AE heal as well as Resto shamans. Priests just can't AE heal so well that Resto shamans become pointless. A group that takes all Holy priests for its healers should feel like it is missing out (though it should still be possible). I would say the same thing about every class in the game. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910221939&amp;pageNo=4#78))<br />
<br />
Shadow Priest DPS and survavibility<br />
We think Shadow priest damage is good in PvE and PvP, minus a few annoying bugs. We think the problem is that Shadow priests just can't survive long enough to do damage. That is a combination of some classes doing too much damage, but also Shadow defenses being too weak. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14133413577&amp;pageNo=15#292))<br />
<br />
Prayer of Healing<br />
Yes, we think the cast time is everything. It’s not a good spell for emergencies (like CoH is). It’s a good spell for a group with several people who are low, but who aren’t in imminent danger of dying. Ideally, we still want the group distinction to go away when you are in a raid, but we aren’t quite there yet. Until we can reach that point (and who knows when that will be) at least you can heal a group with PoH instead of having to worry about who is in your group. <br />
<br />
Our plan is not to make PoH a smart heal. We went that direction with CoH because the instant cast made it possible to just go heal multiple groups quickly. We don’t think there is a danger of that with PoH. So yes, you would target the rogue and it would heal her and the 4 others in her group. But we'll see how things stand when more players have a chance to try it out. I've already healed Ulduar. /gloat (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910222191&amp;pageNo=5#90))<br />

3.1.0 Killing Spree<br />
Just imagine it is exactly like the current Killing Spree except that your dps goes up while Killing Spree is active. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910582413&amp;pageNo=1#1))<br />

3.1.0 Hunger for Blood<br />
The idea with Hunger for Blood is you will probably have bleeds available from other classes in a raid setting (and even if you didn't you can add them yourself). But in PvP it will require an extra step to really benefit from HfB and thus tone down Assassination burst damage a little.<br />
<br />
There are more related changes, some sooner and some in 3.1. We didn't want to list every single change, just a sampling. (EDIT: To prevent a lot more posts from saying the same thing, we know HfB is not popular in PvP now. We don't want to change that as a consequence of these other changes.

<br />
3.1.0 Hunger for Blood (Continued)<br />
The idea with Hunger for Blood is you will probably have bleeds available from other classes in a raid setting (and even if you didn't you can add them yourself). We are making several changes to rogue talents and abilities. Some are coming before 3.1. Some of them are definitely with the intention of toning down PvP burst. If we buff HfB and change some other rogue abilities, there is a risk that HfB will end up getting used for PvP. The extra bleed requirement should help discourage that and thus still satisfy our goal to tone down Assassination burst damage a little.

Vanish<br />
&quot;Working as intended&quot; gets used too broadly.

Pet scaling, more warlock changes in 3.1<br />
I don't want to ninja a rogue thread, but the buffs to demons went beyond fixes to scaling problems. The Infernal and Doom Guard were already scaling correctly, and even they went up.

Deep Wounds hotfixed<br />
We have been working on fixing the bugs with Deep Wounds so that we wouldn't have to just nerf it across the board. Some of those hotfixes may have gone in.<br />
<br />
Fury in particular was doing too much damage on many encounters solely because of these bugs. We think Arms pve damage is probably too low, but we don't want to adjust that by having a buggy Deep Wounds. We also want to make sure prot warriors do not lose too much damage or threat.

1.) The weapon damage got all the modifiers (Enrage or Death wish, Two handed spec.)<br />
2.) Then the bleed got those same modifiers (Enrage/Death+Two handed spec). <br />
This is the change we made: Number 2 will no longer happen. Instead Deep Wounds will just be a percentage of the damage calculated in number 1. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=14910061281&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=5#95))</div></div><hr />

Disc Priests are gonna be even more interesting to play. Most likely Power Word: Barrier will come with a healthy CD. Can you imagine how good it would be if you could get it off on all groups prior to a Malygos Vortex, for example?<br />

Not a fan of the Mace Spec change though! As an Enhancement Shaman I already have too much competition for Maces! More slow one-handed weapons that are NOT fist weapons or swords, plz!</div></div><hr />

I think you can USE it when there is a bleed effect on the target, so it will still stay active even if the bleed effect wears off. The point is, that you cannot use it when there is no bleed effect on the target.<br />
<br />
Also now rogues can go 51/18/2 with the new lighthing reflexes. Should be a viable spec if they buff haste as they said.</div></div><hr />

Anyone whining about performing sub-par as Assassination Rogue or Resto Druid, sure don't know how to play their class, and should either reroll or play a different game. Would probably be better for the rest of us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So nerfing assasination to buff combat is smart, when you got rogues OVERALL well below average dps something does not compute here .I do not see a rogue in the top 5 minus 1 fight, a straight DPS class is getting destroyed by basically everyone <br />

Your proof, is that you had slightly lower overall dps on some of the bossfights? I don't know, 3-400 dps when your averaging 3-3.5k doesnt sound like a big deal to me. I'd chalk that up to either lack of skill, or lack of gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How I understand that, is that you can use it when your target has a bleed on it, that's what it says anyway, so thus it would be a buff. I also like how they've buffed combat so that you might actually not have to be mutilate if you really don't want to.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Takarden</div><div class="date">2009-02-05, 06:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was sad to see some of the Shadow Priest class changes. For weeks i have been reading, &quot;We have some PvP-oriented changes in mind for Shadow. We hope to be able to announce them soon&quot;, to discover &quot;Shadow priest PvP survivability has been improved: Shadow Form now reduces magic as well as physical damage. Dispersion now removes snares&quot;. While disc is getting a group power word shield? Once again, who needs a Shadow Priest? Shadow Priest tools for Pvp are quite useless at the moment.. Our only viable crowd control spell is Psychic Scream, which is not a powerful spell because it is often resisted, trinketed out of, will of forsaken, breaks on damage, tremor totem'd and targets need to be near the priest. Our level 80 spell Divine Hymn is a horrible horrible Spell, it cant be cast in Shadow Form, has a 6 min cool down and shares the global cooldown of Psychic Scream, and brings that cool down to 30 seconds. This is mind boggling because Divine Hymn is a Holy spell yet shares the cool down of a shadow spell? I do not understand that. Our 51 talent is a silencing mana pot that according to next patch will remove snares? I do not see how this will greatly improve survivability, play style or mechanics.. Shadow Priests Silence is on a ***45*** second cool down and now has diminishing returns! Shadow priests damage relies on DoTs yet we have no DoT protection, unless we spec into the Disc Tree!! That talent to have dot protection(Silent Resolve) also reduces threat of holy and disc spells, once again why would a shadow priest need that.. PvP Shadow Priests run out of mana very fast and our tool to return mana is Shadow Fiend, that will either die, is kited, misses or is absorbed in which our mana return from the spell is not very strong. Hymn of Hope is on a 5 min cool down, is channeled and only returns 8% mana over 8 seconds. Who has the chance in Pvp to use that, by the time its cast, it is interrupted and only gained enough mana for 1 spell.. Before wotlk was released the idea to have Psychic Horror add a flee after the fear affect ended was a great idea.. however shadow priest couldnt even get that.. At that time Dispersion returned HP as well, which would be alot better then what it is now.. However that wasn't implemented either.. Shadow priest is a Broken Class.. <br />
<br />
To improve Shadow Priest in pvp, they need some work.. Things that I would love to see are any of the following.. A Dot protection that is in the shadow tree, A crowd crontrol spell that would improve survival such as a unbreakable fear,a counterspell, a way to break targeting, turn into a ghost, idk anything!. And Hymns that work and are useful! If disc priests have imp. mana burn, shadow priest should have imp. mind control, especially if a group bubble spell is added to disc.. Any way thats my thoughts, thks for reading :).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do people have a hard time understanding english? Why is everyone screaming &quot;nerf&quot;?<br />
<br />
This is the old HfB:<br />
# Enrages you, increasing all damage caused by 3%. If used while a Bleed effect is afflicting you, it will attempt to remove it and refund 15 energy. This effect can be stacked up to 3 times. Lasts 30 sec.<br />
<br />
Ergo, when stacked 3 times, it gives you a 9% dmg increase. Now they made it so that it only works with a bleed effect (opening with a Garrote, then Rupture) and it gives a 15% dmg increase (which is 6% more dmg!!). In addition to that, you dont need to stack it 3 times, meaning that IF you fuck up your rotation, you dont have to spend 90 energy to get it back up (assuming they dont change the energy cost).</div></div><hr />

Think it's fun that they buff dicipline that is a working specc for pvp, quite a lot.<br />
While they seem to have so much trouble improving shadow that doesn't work in any way, at all. Unless they are announcing more changes to shadow pvp later.<br />
<br />
I think shadow priest should have gained that thing hunters got, they deserved it more. The hax ability that makes you reflect all spells and dodge every melee attack for 5 sec. But I guess, if it would have been shadow priests that would have gained that ability, they wouldnt have been able to cast spells during the duration ;)<br />

5) We are going to be announcing some of our plans for classes in 3.1 fairly soon. The announcements will be prominent. They will not be comprehensive. We are not going to announce every change we are going to make. We are going to risk giving you some insight into a work in progress, even though we may ultimately decide not to make some of the changes.

This link provides me with the following information that I will qualify by saying I removed Thaddius from the data, as it skews (overemphasizes) differences. (Loatheb can probably be removed as well, but the values change too slightly to bother). % Difference is the % difference from the cumulative mean dps. Source data is the measure of average of top 50 reports, and thus most likely does not include the most recent rounds of nerfs (warriors, hunters), but would include buffs (mages).<br />
<br />
Class Mean % Difference<br />
Warrior 4,520 6.42%<br />
Mage 4,498 5.90%<br />
Hunter 4,424 4.15%<br />
Warlock 4,401 3.62%<br />
Death Knight 4,363 2.71%<br />
Shaman 4,211 -0.87%<br />
Paladin 4,094 -3.62%<br />
Rogue 4,060 -4.42%<br />
Priest 3,959 -6.79%<br />
Druid 3,946 -7.10%<br />
Mean 4,247<br />
<br />
What is worth taking from this? Assuming the goal is for the pure dps classes to be 5% higher than hybrids, Mage, Hunter, Warlock dps is properly higher than most. Warrior dps is far too high and will probably be nerfed further. Death Knight DPS is too close to pure dps, Paladins a bit low. Rogue dps is far too low for a pure class, while Priest and Druid dps is junk even for a hybrid (and will subsequently be buffed). Correcting for the stupidity of the Instructor fight by setting priest dps equal to the mean dps of the other class, however, places Priest dps at a similar level to Paladins (slightly low at 4,086 and -4.06%) and higher than Rogues.<br />
<br />
For comparison's sake, the cumulative mean dps of the ranged classes (mage, hunter, priest, warlock) is 4,321 while the cumulative mean dps of the melee classes (rogues, warriors, death knights, paladins) is 4,259. Shamans and druids are excluded, as they cannot be determined if ranged or melee (although a brief glance at the pages indicate that enhance is outdamaging elemental, and balance outdamages feral routinely). The fights seem balanced in terms of ranged versus melee damage for most classes.<br />
<br />
This is hardly a detailed statistical analysis, but 2am is a bit too late for me to open Stata.<br />
<br />
TLDR SHORTCUT: Buff rogues and druids heavily, priests and paladins slightly. Nerf death knights slightly, warriors heavily.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but this analysis is extremely flawed.<br />
<br />
Clearly the problem is that hybrids are exactly this: Hybrids, thus, there is a high chance that some %-age of the class in the stats was either Tank or Healer, doing significantly less dmg but being averaged in.<br />
<br />
That's why Priest/Druid are so low. You very rarely have more than 1 or max 2 dps druids/priests in raidgroups, but very often have 2-4 heal priests/druids or tank druids.<br />
<br />
That's why Paladins are only relatively low, because if you factor out the holy's and prot's, ret's are doing far too much dmg in Naxx (undead etc.)<br />
<br />
That's probably also why the DKs are so low (which was surprising to me at first), because there are a fair share of DK tanks.<br />

However, it has no stacks and grants a 15% damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Do people have a hard time understanding english? Why is everyone screaming &quot;nerf&quot;?<br />
<br />
This is the old HfB:<br />
# Enrages you, increasing all damage caused by 3%. If used while a Bleed effect is afflicting you, it will attempt to remove it and refund 15 energy. This effect can be stacked up to 3 times. Lasts 30 sec.<br />
<br />
Ergo, when stacked 3 times, it gives you a 9% dmg increase. Now they made it so that it only works with a bleed effect (opening with a Garrote, then Rupture) and it gives a 15% dmg increase (which is 6% more dmg!!). In addition to that, you dont need to stack it 3 times, meaning that IF you fuck up your rotation, you dont have to spend 90 energy to get it back up (assuming they dont change the energy cost).<br />
<br />
<br />
Because, my good friend remanis, people LOVE to complain ... I can't for the life of me see how anyone can see this as a nerf, and yet everyone is adamant it is.<br />
<br />
There is only one way this is a possible change .. not a nerf, a change, because it means altering your rotation in a single situation. That situation is if you're in a raid with no fury warriors, no arms warrior (ok, that might happen), and no Deep wounds spec'd warrior tank and no dps druids or druid tanks. It also assumes your standard rotation does NOT include rupture, which I guess could happen as well.<br />
<br />
So, assuming this is one single, contrived case ... it's simple, start using rupture instead of either envenom or evis (you decide which is better), and get an extra 6% damage boost. If you have a warrior or druid in the raid - big bonus, because then your target will be absolutely boombarded with bleed damage, pretty much guaranteeing you your 15% increase AND it costs you a boat load less energy.<br />
<br />
*sigh* ... fickle people are fickle.</div></div><hr />

Good point, except that the source he used is compiled from using the TOP 50 DPS reports of each class, in other words, tanks (who are not in the top dps per class) are omitted from the data.<br />

I usually end up above the warrior tank and below the 5 other dps.<br />
<br />
But i've seen some nice DPS reports where Druids top the charts, but it all depends on the shape of the rest of the raid. Thats why numbers in general need to be looked at from all angles. Some classes help each other, boosts like heroism or the horde counterpart which I forgot atm help a lot. Numbers are one thing, beating the encounters is another.</div></div><hr />

I'm really looking forward to penance self spamming disk priests in PvP now, seeing that they really don't have any ways of surviving damage as it is...oh wait.<br />
<br />
As for SP changes they will need a lot more than that to be viable in PvP.<br />

It's good that they are buffing combat rogues as not every one wants to play muti. As it is now muti is best for both PvE and PvP which is something that Blizz never seem to get right when it comes to rogues. One season combat is best for everything, then muti and then all the way back to subt and then we restart the cycle again.

People should stop feeling hard done by and just play the game, there are many skilled players in my guild, and no-one tops the dps meters for more than 3 bosses in naxx per night, we leapfrog each other and overtake each other, and each classes dps is based heavily on what boss it is at the time.<br />

A new class is not FotM. Most DKs that have some idea of what they're doing have made their DK their man. This means that most of us will play the DK whether they're OP or not. It is a much more interesting class than any other, which is the reason that I will continue to play it as my main.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And last but not least, why are half the people posting here acting like these are the all-encompassing changes for 3.1? Even the 3 classes already listed are going to have many more changes...just like it says.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Think it's fun that they buff dicipline that is a working specc for pvp, quite a lot.<br />
While they seem to have so much trouble improving shadow that doesn't work in any way, at all. Unless they are announcing more changes to shadow pvp later.<br />
<br />
I think shadow priest should have gained that thing hunters got, they deserved it more. The hax ability that makes you reflect all spells and dodge every melee attack for 5 sec. But I guess, if it would have been shadow priests that would have gained that ability, they wouldnt have been able to cast spells during the duration ;)<br />
<br />
No but please, tell me there is more :-\<br />
<br />
<br />
In regards to the many worried players, Ghostcrawler already announced that what we see now is only samplings of the changes to come. Some of these changes will make it, some might not, and some aren't announced yet. There might (and probably will) be more changes to Rogues, Shammies and Priests, and we're still waiting for a PTR to appear, so take a chill pill and enjoy the sneak peek.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No it isn't. Explain to me how a bunch of people deciding to play a new class (before much was even known about them) is anything like FotM. FotM is when people roll a druid in BC or a ret pally in WotLK. This is done exclusively for the reason that they will be able to &quot;succeed&quot; with their current lackluster skill. If, the day they announced DKs (i.e. when most current DK mains decided to play a DK), Blizzard said that DKs would be one of the 3 strongest classes in both PvP and PvE, then I'd agree with you. <br />
<br />
And what were you responding to when you said &quot;No they didn't.&quot;?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">monkeyfoo</div><div class="date">2009-02-05, 02:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Finally combining totems, took em long enough.<br />
<br />
<br />
They combined the Strength and Agility totems of times past back when 3.0 hit. Also the Windfury totem got removed to be replaced by one that provided a haste bonus. Enh Shamans love this, but many Rogues and Warriors whined a bit as they no longer got uber extra hit procs. I got so many evil stares from EpeenQQ rogues who just had to have a WF totem dropped at all times or else they would fail. <br />
<br />
Now they are finally doing something I have been waiting for. They are now combining Mana/Healing totems into one.. very nice and it will most likely be a water totem. The combining of Disease Cleanse/Poision Cleanse into one totem is also great. Even if it is also a water totem, I do not mind as there have been many times I wished we had both of those cleansing totems out when I was the only Shaman. Plus its one less hotkey I need on my custom UI in WoW.<br />
<br />
The threat reduction now counting for all our attacks, not just melee is also an added bonus. I took pride in a fun way of sometimes on easy runs, being able to match TPS of our very leet Prot Pally. His TPS is aways top notch, but I find ways to sometimes have fun... like stealing aggro on Core Hounds with some really big Chain Lightning and Frost Shocks, LOL</div></div><hr />

Time to leave your Raid Comm. Blizzard can solve many issues through nerfs and buffs, but they can't solve the problem of being in a Community with a bunch of asshats. Seriously, why would you even stay in a Comm that forces you to do a /roll halfway through a raid to decide whether you get to stay when you've committed an evening of your free time to the raid? You play with utter douchebags dude- this game is supposed to be fun ffs, some people seem to lose sight of that fact...</div></div><hr />

That is: Rogues (first of all)<br />
Paladins (their burst, let them a bit OP they deserve it after all the hate)<br />
Death knights (FotM is overplayed by many noobs that faceroll and it's realy bad after the<br />
DK spree)<br />
Mages (3 second rotation anyone?)<br />
<br />
Priests, Warlocks, Shamans and maybe warriors a little bit need some love. Shamans and Warlocks might need love overdose.<br />
<br />
Death Knight whining about ret Paladins, understand Holy is the OP spec.<br />
<br />
Ret gets close to someone he will try and burst that person, burst the ret pally before he does to you and it's gg, our only shitty defense is a 12 sec immunity every 5 min at cost of 50% our damage and not even enough mana to support more than a few heals. <br />
<br />
Kiting, spell locking, chain CCing, poisons and one single unstable affliction in between something can screw us up.<br />
I don't see the OP besides damage, considering what a rogue can do in shorter time seems a fair trade.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fauch</div><div class="date">2009-02-05, 03:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext"># Hunger for Blood – instead of a self-buff, this ability can only be used when there is a bleed effect on the target. However, it has no stacks and grants a 15% damage bonus.<br />
<br />
Do people have a hard time understanding english? Why is everyone screaming &quot;nerf&quot;?<br />
<br />
This is the old HfB:<br />
# Enrages you, increasing all damage caused by 3%. If used while a Bleed effect is afflicting you, it will attempt to remove it and refund 15 energy. This effect can be stacked up to 3 times. Lasts 30 sec.<br />
<br />
Ergo, when stacked 3 times, it gives you a 9% dmg increase. Now they made it so that it only works with a bleed effect (opening with a Garrote, then Rupture) and it gives a 15% dmg increase (which is 6% more dmg!!). In addition to that, you dont need to stack it 3 times, meaning that IF you fuck up your rotation, you dont have to spend 90 energy to get it back up (assuming they dont change the energy cost).<br />
<br />
<br />
Right, I need to open with garrote, can't use mutilate anymore (when i want to have the new hfb active) while I stacked hfb in stealth already. sucks for soloing imo. either I open with muti or cheap shot, but not with garrote ...<br />
and In naxx, for me, hfb is always active, even on trash, great, now with the change i need to garrote a trash mob ?! wtf, And we don't even know how it will work, if it's going to be a buff, if it is, what its duration is going to be, perhaps it's rather a debuff on the bleeding target, so it's useless when switching targets or using it on trash. And we are not able to remove bleed effects anymore. The change sucks imo, but we'll see how it works out on the PTR. We are Rogues, we'll adapt.</div></div><hr />

arcane mages - nerf burst but buff surv <br />
retri - just a lil burst nerf<br />
holy - removing snares + holy shock needs a big NERF<br />
dk - ranged dmg too big (gar,pet, and ranged abilities) combine with no downtime and a lot of dmg reduce/immune (NERF)<br />
rogues -nerf dmg on cloth...buff dmg on plate<br />
buff elemental - enhance a bit - nerf resto a bit (but hey not every talent tree should be pvp)<br />
lock - give + surv<br />
hunters will be fine i think (after surv nerf)<br />
buff SP - disc will work out fine i think<br />
resto droods need a bit more dispell resistance on hots<br />
warrs - buff arms, nerf prot... make them less dependent on RNG</div></div><hr />

I really appreciate what Blizz is doing with DPS problem. Aiming for the combat three, they are avoiding giving PvP a boost as well. But do you guys think that those changes will make a big diffrence in single target DPS? <br />

WARLOCK<br />
<br />
# Improved Shadow Bolt – this talent now provides a 5% spell critical strike buff (similar to Improved Scorch).<br />
# Improved Soul Leech – this talent now provides Replenishment (similar to shadow priests)<br />
# Drain Soul now has a chance to produce Soul Shards even if the target doesn’t die.<br />
# Siphon Life no longer as an active ability but the talent grants the old Siphon Life effect to Corruption.<br />
# Curse of Recklessness and Curse of Weakness have been combined into one spell<br />
# Consume Shadows – this Voidwalker ability is no longer channeled but has a cooldown.<br />
# Several other warlock talents have had their ranks reduced, their effects changed or removed. This list includes but is not limited to Demonic Empathy, Shadow Embrace, Eradication, Suppression, and Pandemic.<br />
# Additional new talents have been added.<br />
<br />
DRUID<br />
<br />
# Savage Defense – this is a new passive ability. When a druid in Dire Bear form deals a melee critical strike, the druid gains a damage shield equal to 25% of their attack power. The next hit completely removes the shield regardless of how much damage was done.<br />
# Survival of the Fittest has had its bonus armor reduced to compensate for the above increase in damage mitigation.<br />
# Faerie Fire (and similar debuffs) now reduces armor by 5%. See Sunder Armor in the warrior update below for additional details.<br />
# Thorns and Nature’s Grasp can be cast in Tree of Life form.<br />
# Survival Instincts now works in Moonkin form.<br />
# Replenish – to avoid confusion, this talent has been renamed “Revitalize.” It now also works with Wild Growth.<br />
# We are also looking at increasing the sustained (not burst) damage of feral druids in cat form.<br />
<br />
WARRIOR<br />
<br />
# Changing stances now has a much reduced cost: you lose a maximum of 20 rage (10 with Tactical Mastery). For example, if you have 100 rage and change stances, you will have 80 rage remaining. If you have 10 rage and change stances, all of your rage is lost. In addition, we may change the penalties associated with some stances.<br />
# You now gain rage when damage done to you is absorbed, such as through a Power Word: Shield.<br />
# Blood Frenzy now causes 2/4% physical damage done.<br />
# Sunder Armor (and similar debuffs) now reduces armor by 4% per application, and is now a single rank. Creature armor has been globally reduced so that debuffed targets should take about the same damage from physical attacks that they did before this change. The net effect should be that this debuff is slightly less mandatory in PvE and is not disproportionately more powerful against cloth targets in PvP.<br />
# We are also adding increased damage to Arms, possibly through Overpower or Slam.<br />
# We are also looking at granting rage when the warrior blocks, dodges or parries.<br />

Because people enjoy the play style? Also you are so completely incorrect. As single target utility based healers discipline priests have the tools to compete in PvE and do it very well.<br />

most priests will still spec holy in PvE if they want to heal. I'm really looking forward to penance self spamming disk priests in PvP now, seeing that they really don't have any ways of surviving damage as it is...oh wait.<br />

<br />
Because idiots like you have told them to go holy to heal and some of the idiots are raid leaders and that means that discipline priests have problems getting guaranteed raid spots. It doesn't mean they aren't good, it just means that they have been ignored for a long time. The tide is changing though. Penance is a channeled spell, if you can't interupt a channeled spell in pvp it says more about you than the person casting the spell.</div></div><hr />

# Survival Instincts now works in Moonkin form.<br />
<br />
Being able to cast Thorns and Nature's Grasp in Tree of Life form will help out a little with PvP survival, however, I wish they would make Barkskin in such a manner it dazes targets hitting you, as a baseline part of the ability.<br />
<br />
Secondly - Survival Instincts for Moonkin Form ? Does this imply this talent will become a baseline ability ? I can't see Moonkins 'wasting' 10 talents in Feral just to get this, even for PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You are a trash rogue that can't kill a disc priest as quickly as you kill other cloth casters so you want them nerfed till you can aren't you?<br />
<br />
They aren't getting buffs as much as they are getting changes. They are getting new things and they are gaining utility, but mostly this is being done to address the issues the class had. Divine spirit not being baseline was stupid (imp divine spirit will probably still be in the disc tree). A group shield ability just adds a little bit of group utility. It probably has a 6 second cool down and it probably asorbs about the same amount that coh heals for (after 3.1 when its buffed). Penance is a heal and having a healer that can't use one of their most powerful heals on themselves is just stupid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard used the term &quot;hero&quot; class and every newb took that to mean the most powerful class in the game. There are even post from newbs saying that DKs should be the most powerful &quot;hero&quot; class in the game so they need buffs every time they don't own the meters. That speaks to be extremely FotM. The truth is DKs are way higher than they should be right now in the hands of any skilled player and way to low in the hands of anyone that can't play, so balancing them should be fun for Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard can solve many issues through nerfs and buffs, but they can't solve the problem of being in a Community with a bunch of asshats. Seriously, why would you even stay in a Comm that forces you to do a /roll halfway through a raid to decide whether you get to stay when you've committed an evening of your free time to the raid? You play with utter douchebags dude- this game is supposed to be fun ffs, some people seem to lose sight of that fact...<br />
<br />
<br />
In a top raiding guild the only thing they give a damn about is being on top. That is normally why you see a lot of the starter top raiding guilds disbanding by the time third wave content comes out. Progression guilds that actually stay on top have had the same members since the game came out and value those members very highly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Exaggerate much? No one wants you to do the same amount of damage as the tank. They just don't want you to out dps rogues/locks/mages/hunters on almost every fight or burst them down in pve in 2-3 hits.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Very unlikely. The starter talents in the feral tree have normally affected the moonkin form in the past. I really don't want to speculate on how much this change will actually affect moonkins.</div></div><hr />

That is: Rogues (first of all)<br />
<br />
<br />
That's the problem, while Rogues may be too powerful in PvP (i wouldn't know, i gave up on the joke called WoW PvP back in the first honor system), they need to be buffed in PvE. We have rogues in 25 man epic gear being matched in raid DPS by fresh DKs/TG Warriors who just hit 80 and have on a bunch of crafted gear (the crafted gear is good these days, but seriously).<br />
<br />
Seriously nerfing Rogues in PvP will probably carry over to PvE...which means Rogues would then do about as much DPS as a Prot Warrior not tanking.<br />
<br />
Blizzard insisting on using the same balance #s for both PvP/PvE was a giant mistake on their part years ago.</div></div><hr />

Tanks, healers, and the woefully inept would not appear as part of the dataset, Socronoss. <br />
<br />
The results give a general picture of what to expect; it isn't definitive proof of each classes max dps. There are plenty of shortcomings to such an analysis: underperforming specs ignored, pre 3.0.8 data, are the top results with all buffs included, et cetera. These numbers just reinforce the points Blizzard has made routinely; warrior dps was far too high, mage and hunter's a bit higher than everyone, rogue dps very very low, and druid dps dead last. <br />
<br />
Poysonivy<br />
Druid dps is the only one that might be ignored in that picture, as feral does indeed cause an conundrum. I never said this was clear cut, though, and you must understand that most of that data will be of Balance druids, not ferals. I'm not going to parse timestamped reports and form my own dataset for a 15 minute writeup, regardless, but good point nevertheless. <br />

IMO, every class and every spec needs this. Not only that but it will give every player in the game a better idea of where their class is going and what their spec is meant to do. <br />

The Role of the Priest (Source)<br />
This is an experiment. One of the things that has confused me a little are all of the posts from players who say they don't understand the role of the priest class. It is unclear to us why there is so much confusion about this particular class, which seems to us to be fairly straightforward.<br />
<br />
We are often reluctant to lay out our design goals very clearly, because frankly some players tend to use those statements to attempt to lawyer us into changes (&quot;I'm supposed to be the master of AE damage&quot;) or would rather argue about the design instead of providing feedback on how the class actually works.<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, because players have asked for it so often and in the interest of trying to foster the discussion, here is what we think of as the role of the priest class.<br />
<br />
The Role of the Priest <br />
The priest is a caster class that uses Holy and Shadow magic. Priests can only wear cloth armor and have a limited selection of weapons, but do most of their damage and healing from range. They make up for their low armor with spells that offer protection and healing.<br />
<br />
Discipline -- this is a healing tree that emphasizes survival and single-target healing. Discipline specializes in damage absorption and prevention rather than restoring health, although they are very capable in that department too.<br />
Holy -- this is a healing tree that has a spell suited for every situation. Holy priests can heal groups, heal individuals, heal tanks, or do all three in a single encounter. They are better at group healing than Discipline priests, but don't have as many damage prevention capabilities.<br />
Shadow -- this tree sacrifices healing for damage. Shadow priests can restore health and mana to their group while casting their spells. Like the Shadow damage of warlocks, Shadow priest damage tends towards drains and damage over time spells. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You want to know WHY people are confused about the roles of a priest? Do you actually play your own game? Priests have two functions in raid situations: Heal, or Shadow DPS/Regenerate. At this time, Shamans rule the Group Heals, Druids Rule the Heal over Time buffs, and Holy Paladins are unmatchable in their Single Target healing abilities.<br />
<br />
And you want to know WHY people are confused about priests? It's because you have taken a class that has very specific roles in a group and made them obsolete behind the Hybrid classes, which are HYBRID so that they can be usable for different things, NOT outdo the classes DESIGNED to the job!<br />
<br />
Confused about the role of priests. That makes me laugh.</div></div><hr />

Divine Spirit – this spell is now a core ability available to all priests.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hehe, with this the only former top-talent in the priest trees that hasn't become a base spell, and even still remain in the same spot of the tree, is Shadowform<br />

<br />
But how about the other non tier dps class like spriest, feral druid, enhanced or elemental shammys, etc. If the tier dps class could also AoE, CC, and provide party buffs, etc why the heck would i bother bringing the non tier dps class to raid if all have the same utility skills.<br />
<br />
I've read before that blizz wanted bring the PLAYER to raid not the CLASS by giving several class mana regen skills unlike before that only an spriest could do it. <br />
<br />
If blizz is really sticking to their statment they should balance all the DPS, HEALING, TANKING class. They should never use words like Tier DPS Classes are Mages, Locks, Hunter, Etc. so they must have more edge compared to other classes. Maybe if blizz could buff the other class well see more classes in raid.<br />
<br />
The player who is using the class must be the one given the credit for doing good in his task be it tanking, dpsing or healing not the class who just clicks on one botton and does crazy healing / dps.<br />
<br />
<br />
And for the Hybrid Classes which are beign left behind by the other classes i think a specilization in there skills must be added so they could have fair fighting chance in competing with the non hybrid classes.</div></div><hr />
