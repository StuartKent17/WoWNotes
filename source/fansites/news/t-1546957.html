We recently found some extra footage shot just moments after the Mists of Pandaria cinematic (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wvYXoyxLv64), when these two characters had their conflict cut short by Chen Stormstout.</div></div><hr />

I personally enjoyed it. A little random and outta left field but I liked it.</div></div><hr />

It says nothing about being &quot;cut&quot;. Its just something they made for fun, like how Pixar animated films have bloopers/outtakes afterwards. They aren't cut scenes from the actual films, they're just made for entertainment purposes.</div></div><hr />

For those of yall complaining saying it cost you something, IT WAS THE DEPARTMENT THAT DOES CINEMATICS. Meaning that the cinematic for WoD is probably done or being polished. Jeez they do one thing on one part of the game and you act like it cost so much from everything else. Not every single person at Blizzard works on every single thing they do....hence whey there are different departments...Jeez you single minded people...</div></div><hr />

<br />
a) The cinematics team makes cinematics and only cinematics. That‚Äôs all they do.<br />
b) Because of the first point, they sit around bored half or more of the time since they‚Äôre really only needed around the launch of new games/xpacs.<br />
<br />
On top of all that, this was very clearly whipped together on a whim (see the the shoulder clipping issues that others mentioned). It costed the company precisely nothing to make and was probably done in the middle of waiting on something necessary to complete the WoD cinematic.</div></div><hr />

There are some animation problems, look at the admiral shoulder pads clipping through the arm at around 24 sec when he lift his arm. This was made in a 2-3 days work.<br />
<br />
Maybe you didn't read the blue post.<br />
<br />
It's LEFTOVER animation, it was supposed to show after the actual trailer itself but they took it out. This is older than the expansion and they just wanted to put it up to show people considering all the effort that was put into it in the first place.</div></div><hr />

Just because the expansion is coming out doesn't mean blizzards gonna drop every single thing they've done in the past like paid mounts and paid pets off of the store and some people also think the molten corgi is effort blizzard could be exerting elsewhere how hard do you think it is for blizzard to make a mount or a pet there's like what 500 mounts in the game?<br />

<br />
a) The cinematics team makes cinematics and only cinematics. That‚Äôs all they do.<br />
b) Because of the first point, they sit around bored half or more of the time since they‚Äôre really only needed around the launch of new games/xpacs.<br />
<br />
On top of all that, this was very clearly whipped together on a whim (see the the shoulder clipping issues that others mentioned). It costed the company precisely nothing to make and was probably done in the middle of waiting on something necessary to complete the WoD cinematic.<br />
<br />
No they don't, the cinematic take a long ass time, usually done over the entire development time, not in the last month before release.<br />

It's also not a WoW cinematics team, it's Blizzards cinematic team, working on all games, they are always working on something.</div></div><hr />

They are acting out for attention. All it is. They have nothing more meaningful in their lives so they come here hoping for some shred of attention no matter good or bad. And it's easier to attract attention when being a negative nancy.</div></div><hr />

No one is seriously angry about the resources spent on this, anyone with an inkling of intelligence knows that the cinematics team is not the development team and that this little snippet was likely created a long time ago.<br />
<br />
What we're pissed about is the way that Blizzard cheat us of the content they continuously promise (faster patches and all the things being cut from WoD) and then they use little videos like this and the tweet about the Molten Corgi to distract us from asking questions or talking about things in a negative manner.</div></div><hr />

Enjoy Blizzard turning into EA, stripping the game of things that it should have it in.<br />

Well since Activision has a controlling stake in Blizzard it's understandable how crappy this game has become.. Just look at the Call of Duty games that bring nothing new to the game and already tell stories we already know the ending too not to mention are incredibly boring.</div></div><hr />

In this day and age of LFR/Flex you don't need to beat the Heroic content and earn the Hero of the Alliance/Gladiator titles to be 'finished' with the content. Content is done when you're bored with it, and no one can be blamed for being bored when we're ten months into this current iteration, with likely another 4-5 months to go.</div></div><hr />

Good then be bored and do something besides WoW. When you beat another game do you really keep playing it over and over on the easier difficulties or do you decide you want to try again for a harder challenge? If you're bored with something put it down and enjoy something else. WoW isn't going anywhere you can come back to it anytime. Complaining isn't going to make WoD come out faster.</div></div><hr />

I completely blame anyone for being bored of the game and yet still keep playing instead of moving away from it for a bit and doing something else for a while. You don't have to play WoW each and every day of the year. It is just like any other game, treat it as such. If I were bored of Dark Souls 2, do you think I would just keep playing it and QQing on DS2 forums about how bored I am?</div></div><hr />

Apologist bullshit like this is basically why Blizzard gets away with going back on their promises :rolleyes:<br />

The difference being that you pay a subscription for WoW, money that really should be funding more content and when that content is delayed or cut I think people have a right to complain.<br />
<br />
As for the inevitable 'then just unsubscribe and vote with your wallet' - people already are, subs are the lowest they've been since the end of Vanilla and I suspect that is at least partly because of the number of people who are bored waiting for fresh content or don't like to be promised things that are never delivered.</div></div><hr />

Hey guys. Sorry, you can't have any new content until I'm finished with it!<br />
<br />
I'll get around to that when I get a chance. Until then I'll let Blizzard know they should put a few more pets and mounts in the store to hold you over.<br />
<br />
Try enjoying the game (or other games pls) instead of whining. There's plenty of content there for you to do, but you're just choosing not to do it and instead come to MMO-C and complain that you have nothing to do. Trust me you'll have way more fun playing the game (again, or other games) instead of raging about a little cinematic on a fansite. <br />
<br />
<br />
Apologist bullshit like this is basically why Blizzard gets away with going back on their promises :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The difference being that you pay a subscription for WoW, money that really should be funding more content and when that content is delayed or cut I think people have a right to complain.<br />
<br />
As for the inevitable 'then just unsubscribe and vote with your wallet' - people already are, subs are the lowest they've been since the end of Vanilla and I suspect that is at least partly because of the number of people who are bored waiting for fresh content or don't like to be promised things that are never delivered.<br />
<br />
Subs are &quot;low&quot; (7 million is a really low number) because sensible people are smart and decide they don't want to keep paying for a game they aren't having fun with or just don't have the time to play. Wrath had the pre-expansion lull, Cata had the pre-expansion lull, MoP is in its pre-expansion lull. You obviously aren't enjoying this game so why are you even torturing yourself with playing it?</div></div><hr />

ohhh u.......*facepalm* this was just cut from the release of mists ,same as the other warcraft/diablo/starcraft cinematics have changes over time.<br />
So it didnt cut into any resources at all (maybe sound Dep. a bit but i am shure it was in the original).<br />

For my humble opinion they sould bring more cut stuff as short vid after release :p . <br />

<br />
Dude.....you are so right.<br />
Maybe the cinematic team did it during the developement phase of WoD. So what......its &quot;just&quot; the cinematic team. They are not envolved in terms of gameplay or anything else. They are here for cinematics, ingame-events and such things. And till now they did some good jobs.<br />
And this video....we still dont know if it was done during the developement of MoP or just something they did to fill some time till they can do some work on WoD:<br />
<br />
Edit says: I didnt read the blue post. After reading it i am shure it was some work during or after the work on the MoP intro video.</div></div><hr />

People who are not angry at this need to understand that it is a deliberate attempt from Blizzard to distract us from the things they dont want us thinking about, like the length of time the current tier is out, or the amount of content cut or changed in WoD.<br />

<br />
It's LEFTOVER animation, it was supposed to show after the actual trailer itself but they took it out. This is older than the expansion and they just wanted to put it up to show people considering all the effort that was put into it in the first place.<br />
<br />
Maybe you should reread the blue post:<br />
<br />
<br />
We recently found some extra footage shot just moments after the Mists of Pandaria cinematic, when these two characters had their conflict cut short by Chen Stormstout.<br />
<br />
This whole sentence is worded as a joke, like if they looked at the tape, like it was a documentary or real events. It was never truly meant to be in the MoP cinematic, it's just to introduce the joke. Also, even if that was indeed leftover animation, it was rendered to production final quality, which means they've put the sequence through the whole pipeline. The cloth simulation guys (although on the shoulderpads I suspect this is key frame animated) would have went through the whole process anyways. So in any case, whether it truly is leftover animation that was sent to lighting and render or not, it was quickly made, because I spotted this interpenetration at first glance. It would have taken an animator less than an hour or 2 to fix it. (I work in an 3D animation studio, and I see this type of fixes happening every day).</div></div><hr />

It's a terrible analogy. He's conflicting individuals with a group. He thinks that if &quot;Bob&quot; says &quot;It was suppose to be out within nine months, this is delayed&quot; then when &quot;Jim&quot; says &quot;It's coming out tomorrow?! That's rushed!&quot; They are one and the same person. <br />

I personally enjoyed it. A little random and outta left field but I liked it.<br />
<br />
This. The cinematics team is completely separate from the group that does game content. Totally different set of tools, skills and experience. They are an animation studio within Blizzard doing nothing but this stuff for all of their games. Folks making claims about raid tiers or dungeon budget going to this don't know WTF they're talking about with respect to game development in general much less Blizzard specifically.</div></div><hr />

It very well could have been done by one or two guys initially, as a joke with the data sets and rigs they already had. That kind of thing happens. This sort of short, contained little scene is like an exercise from an animation class. It wouldn't be out of the question if, for instance, some young new hire whipped it together in their off hours, making use of all the pre-rigged and possibly even pre-lit setups.</div></div><hr />

Their artistic vision for humans, since TFT, has transformed into pink-skinned, goofy looking orcs. Well, I guess Varian and Anduin still look good, but aside from that, he's just a pink orc.</div></div><hr />

They are an animation studio within Blizzard doing nothing but this stuff for all of their games. Folks making claims about raid tiers or dungeon budget going to this don't know WTF they're talking about with respect to game development in general much less Blizzard specifically.<br />
<br />
this so much. in addition the cinematics folks also operate under a budget and like more than a few places with a budget if they see money not being used they decide you don't in fact need the money so this very well could be them just building something quick and fun while trying to not go TOO under budget.</div></div><hr />

Oh really. So you just skipped over the poop quests that have been in every expansion. In point of fact, it's the dreadfully serious content that's off tone with the rest of the game, if one wants to take a critical look at the design and content as a whole.

<br />
So showing these two characters in a bar trying to get a grasp on the craziness they saw during the cinematic is bad humor? Can i ask you how you would've changed it to make it better or funnier? This is just extra footage which was meant to be a light-hearted joke, it doesn't need to be subtle, but it's not loud and obvious either, it's just meant to give you a bit of a chuckle. I think you should stop speaking for everyone and just yourself since small, chuckle-worthy jokes are the type of humor Blizzard has always had, and comedy is EXTREMELY subjective to begin with.</div></div><hr />

WoW hasn't released fresh content for roughly eleven months. The likes of FFXIV, Wildstar and GW2 have - and they're doing pretty well for themselves with a pretty stable number of players. We don't need to worry about them 'dying'.<br />

<br />
The ironic thing about that is, updating Silvermoon WILL cost them a raid tier. Silvermoon is literally a cardboard cut-out, they would have to spend all of their time designing buildings and actually fleshing out the entire zone, as well as taking Silvermoon &amp; Exodar off the burning crusade server to become a part of Azeroth instead of Outlands, which, last time I heard was easier on paper. The point being, all of that hard work for a few low levels who can't even fly, and the handful of level 90s who don't wanna walk? Blizzard already stated the effort isn't worth the reward in this situation. And to be honest, remodeling Silvermoon and Exodar won't populate the city, (and the next continent won't have flying anyways so it's pointless to begin with.) Those cities are deserted because they are disconnected from the rest of the world, and reside in the far corners of the map. It's alot more impractical than say, Stormwind and Ironforge, or Orgrimmar and Thunder Bluff, which are very close and connected to eachother.<br />
<br />
Also, rival MMOs aren't a factor in people having a warped vision of how Blizzard works, people will just always assume the worse, because if the community hasn't proven it already - there are always going to be ignorant haters who bash everything Blizzard do, and scrounge for reasons to bash WoW, even if that reason is a strawman. On top of that, when's the last time a rival MMO has ever put a dent in WoW subs? Last time i remember was either Aion or Rift, and people were disappointed for both. Folks will try out a new mmo then get bored and come back to WoW, it's just part of the expansion life cycle, and right now we're in the dry period. But i digress, you got my point anyways.</div></div><hr />

Again, how long have you been playing? That's not Cataclysm. Homoerotic humor has been part of Belfs from the very beginning, from day one BC. <br />

The difference there is that something like GW2 has to put new content out because of its business model. If they don't, people leave. Wildstar is a brand new MMO so needs to keep adding new stuff for people to do otherwise the same happens there. Can't comment on FFXIV since I literally know nothing about it's life after the re-release.<br />

Funny how some players will prop up Blizzard as some polished masterpiece, but when players look back there is shit talk about broken things from bugs to shitty implementation along with features that are ether delayed or cut.

Pretty sure the people that made this one either:<br />
<br />
1) The people responsible for the trailer are probably not working to create any content for the game, meaning nothing was actually lost making it.<br />
2) Already made the trailer, or at least mostly made it before MoP.<br />

And you probably spent more time typing this complaint than you did watching the video.</div></div><hr />

It makes me seriously wonder how poor your lives must be that you can't even stop and enjoy some lighthearted fun.<br />
<br />
Of course, that probably explains a lot; I imagine for most of the people complaining about this, WoW hasn't been about &quot;fun&quot; for a very long time.<br />
<br />
And that's very sad.<br />
<br />
WoW is srs bznss, dude, you don't even understand.<br />
<br />
When they step into their zombie/upright-walking-cow/space-goat/midget or lion-faced man character they're there to do The Lord's Work. When they group up with a bunch of other goblins and the like to take down giant monsters for synthetic armor and items that make big numbers appear on screen everyone around them is there to do a job and they all know it's to keep everyone else safe in their pathetic normal lives.<br />
<br />

This also means the clip was made during CATACLYSM, not MoP. <br />
The other thing to note is if people are complaining that warlords is taking too long, apparently you either were not here for Dragon Soul or unsubbed then till MoP release, because not only was Dragon Soul out longer, it was also considerably shorter in terms of the raid (granted it did have 3 dungeons they tacked in and not much else)</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry but according to the thread you aren't allowed to be upset unless you're a horrible bitter virgin who needs to get outside and contribute to society.</div></div><hr />

<br />
as they did with every expansion previous, it doesn't matter if they unsub or not. A lot of people also whine there is no new raid content, that its all SoO. Those same people would have cried even louder had a partial raid been added in like Ruby Sanctum ... because it was &quot;Wasted content that took away from the release of WoD.&quot;<br />
<br />
Blizzard cannot win for losing. No matter what they do, someone some where has beef with them over it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah Blizzard NO FUN OR FUNNY VIDEOS ALLOWED!. What do you think you are a video game company!?<br />
<br />
<br />
Why is it okay for Valve to make a 14 minute comedic TF2 video about the merc's having tumors and fighting a giant bread monster that has nothing to do with the update? Meanwhile Blizzard makes a 50 second comedic follow-up to a serious cinematic and their fans whine. It just seems like the WoW community hates fun or for that matter anything that Blizzard puts out. Why continue to pay for the game when you whine about everything its developers do?</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was the worst attempt at comedy Blizzard has ever come up with, it was the cheapest and most pathetic attempt at comedy I've ever seen.<br />
<br />
If you think that section was awesome, I'm honestly not surprised and Blizzard has done well of beating down its player base's expectations.<br />
<br />
That's why we enjoy playing WoW and you don't. Shun the non believer!<br />

They don't. They come here and complain to others so they can rationalize all the wasted time they spent playing this game. But in the end it's still a game and wasting time is the whole point.</div></div><hr />

This one post here pretty much sums up what is wrong with people now days, when a company gets hated at so much for releasing a light hearted video showing a what I would say a happy ending to MoP.. Then we as a species are all doomed..<br />
<br />
And so far the time between current patch and next xpac is probably taking longer considering all the changes that they are having to make..</div></div><hr />

image is a huge deal, especially when you have SUBSCRIBERS. you think people really wanna see this stuff when an expansion is so late into being released?</div></div><hr />

It is impossible for WoD to be late. It never had a release date.</div></div><hr />

lmfao? 5.4 is the longest patch they've had before an expansion. it's late - get over it.</div></div><hr />
