TheSpeedGamers Mario Marathon<br />
If you read this site regularly you probably know that every now and then I like to mention of the Speed Gamers Marathon (http://www.thespeedgamers.com/) on the front page. I think I skipped the past 2 but an 8 days Mario Marathon is currently in progress and it's definitely worth mentioning. <br />
<br />
The marathon is to support ACT Today (http://www.act-today.org/) (Autism and Care Treatment) and will last until Friday. As usual I'll keep the stream and the ChipIn widget on the front page for a while.<br />

Raids &amp; Dungeons<br />
Caster Legendary in Cataclysm<br />
Blizzard has already confirmed that the first tier of Cataclysm raiding will have a caster DPS legendary weapon. Probably a dagger. <br />
I don't *think* we've confirmed that, but there was a lot of press last week so maybe somebody said something off the cuff. :)<br />
<br />
We haven't put a legendary on the first tier of content the last two expansions. It just feels too soon and doesn't have the same impact when everyone is upgrading their gear so quickly from leveling.<br />
<br />
We agree that it's probably the caster's turn when we do get around to adding one. I would be surprised if it was a dagger given that our artists like to have so much fun with the art -- even though Warcraft daggers are as large as claymores from other games, they're still relatively small. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399621463/caster-dps-legendary-weapon-cata/))<br />
<br />
Legendaries in 10 and 25-man raids<br />
How legendaries will work out on a chance to obtain the items has yet to be determined. We are trying to avoid having one raid be the defacto better way to go simply based on gear and leave it up to the way players want to play. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399601670/1-25-man-raid-50-of-1-10-man-2-10s-100/))<br />
<br />
Raid progress and shared 10/25-Man Raid ID in Cataclysm<br />
I don't think it is that simple. Making raid progress is a really powerful motivator for a lot of players. While we design raiding to be much more inclusive than it used to be, we still want skill to be a big component. We don't want raiding to just be about who has the most free time, but who uses that time for the most progress. To be successful, MMOs need to had wide appeal. You should be able to have a professional or social life or (heaven forbid) other games you like to play and still feel like you can make progress in WoW.<br />
<br />
The old BG model was one that essentially rewarded who played the most. Since some players were willing to play a ridiculous and unreasonable number of hours, the numbers were tuned around that to the point at which many players felt like the feature just wasn't for them. As you point out, they could have just made very slow progress, but in reality they felt so far behind that they chose not to participate at all. While the Arena design has its limitations, one of the things I like is that you can play your matches for the week and be done.<br />
<br />
There are plenty of players who chose 25-player raiding over 10-player raiding and had no desire to kill a boss multiple times a week, but felt like they had to do so to earn badges and loot to stay competitive. We considered models such as letting you kill a boss as many times a week as you wanted but only having loot rights once, but then we realized how horrible that was going to be for say the guild's main tank who would be asked to raid constantly without even the hope for more loot of his own.<br />
<br />
Really we're just trying to deliver on the original LK intent, which was you choose whether you like 10 or 25. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399741109/why-does-blizz-want-us-to-raid-less/))<br />
<br />
Amount of gear in 10/25-Man Raids<br />
The amount of gear in the 25 person raids will be roughly equivalent on per-person basis to the 10 person raids. One thing to keep in mind it that we don't plan to allow players to upshift from 10s to 25s, only downshift from 25s to 10s on a given week.<br />
<br />
The statements beforehand said that 25person would have more gear per person than 10s, so I wonder if &quot;roughly equivalent&quot; indicates a change in plans, or just not wanting to commit yet to either &quot;exactly the same&quot; or &quot;more&quot;.<br />
The number 6 per boss was being mentioned I believe, so slightly more I guess, but anything can change in testing so I wouldn't say that it is set in stone. But we all know you guys won't call us out if anything changes during a beta, right? :)<br />
<br />
So basically there will be no real incentive (gear-wise at least) to run 25 man raids.<br />
There are rewards like badges/gold for the additional coordination involved, but we are trying to avoid having gear be the reason that one style is better than the other.<br />
<br />
Guild Perks / Leveling<br />
Guild Talents &quot;removal&quot;<br />
The only difference in the way we are handling the guild talents is it will be possible to get all of them instead of having one person in your guild pick and choose which ones you got. The feature has always focused on leveling your guild to unlock new perks. In fact, you're getting more perks this way than you would have if the decisions had been exclusive. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399601135/please-rethink-the-guild-tree-and-path-removl/))<br />
<br />
I understand not giving the GM all the power, but having a group customization would be fun. <br />
But why would that be fun? Let's walk through it for a bit. Do you think it would be fun to try and recruit new members because you chose the &quot;right&quot; talent build? Do you think it would be fun to try and argue with your members about what the right talents were to take? Do you think it would be fun to feel like you should leave your guild because they took a lot of talents that didn't affect your play style? Those were all the problems we ran into as we started implementing things. Instead of the feature being exciting, it was causing a lot of anxiety for everyone here who was in a guild. Guilds are supposed to be about friends -- not min maxxing guild benefits. There are plenty other aspects of the game where you can min-max. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399601135/please-rethink-the-guild-tree-and-path-removl/))<br />
<br />
Guild Perks and Items rewards<br />
There are two categories of rewards. The perks are things earned by the guild. If you join a high-level guild, you get those benefits immediately and you lose them if you bail on the guild. They are passive bonuses and a couple of spells, not items. Separately, there are also items you can purchase. The items are yours to keep even if you leave the guild. In order to discourage guild hopping, you have to make some kind of investment in the guild. But you can still choose to leave if in the future you just find that you'd rather be with someone else. (Source[/b] (]Guild Leveling<br />
There are many ways to earn guild levels. We want to make sure nearly every existing guild has a shot at them all. The only question will be how fast you level. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399601135/please-rethink-the-guild-tree-and-path-removl/))<br />
<br />
Player vs. Player<br />
Rated Battlegrounds<br />
We keep a lot of players in mind when designing these types of things which is why we want to make it easily accessible. The guild you are listed in has a rather large number of people and the guild leveling/achievement system will help support this. Being in a guild like this, it likely won't be difficult to find a few guildies to put together a team and hop in the rated BG queue. There will still be non-rated BGs much like they are today if that suits you better.<br />
<br />
There likely won't be detriments for losing rated BG games, but the increase of rating for winning. (At least when you first get going in them). Yes, you need to win to get rewards. Rated BGs aren't meant to be a way to just casually and aimlessly get the best PvP gear in the game, but to reward those who compete (and win) on the grand scale of battlegrounds. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399851566/can-t-we-go-back-to-the-tbc-pvp-system/))<br />
<br />
Joining Rated Battlegrounds<br />
This was just mentioned above, but I'll reiterate just for the sake of it. You need to be in a full group to join the rated BG queue. The team can change every week, between every match, whenever you like. The rating you receive is personal and not team-based so it doesn't matter who else is in the group. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399851566/can-t-we-go-back-to-the-tbc-pvp-system/))<br />
<br />
Levitate/Water Walking exploit in Battlegrounds<br />
Water Walking and Levitate was indeed removed from Battlegrounds. This was done to prevent the exploit in Strand of the Ancient.<br />
<br />
[...] You shouldn't be able to use it during the preparation phase. After the preparation phase, these spells should work normally. Also, the fix should not remove any active auras that are turned on during the preparation phase (i.e. Path of Frost, Paladin Auras, etc). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399601636/bug-water-walking-can-t-be-cast-for-bg/))<br />
<br />
Miscellaneous<br />
Worgens/Goblins Death Knight on Cataclysm release day<br />
We weren't going to prevent goblin or worgen DKs from day one. The realm first feats are cool, but I'm not sure we should let them dictate what classes people can and can't play. The entire realm first thing is over in a day or two anyway.<br />
<br />
The thread implies you guys heard something different though, possibly from the recent press event. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026666097/deathknight-request-let-your-voice-be-heard/))<br />
<br />
Beta Invitation<br />
One safe way to check is to log into your account at http://battle.net and check the &quot;Manage My Games&quot; section. If you actually received a beta invite, it wouldn't be in the form of a key. Your account would simply be flagged and the Cataclysm logo would show up in the &quot;Manage My Games&quot; section, allowing you to install it.<br />
<br />
This is the safest way to check without clicking on any links sent to you. With that said, we have not begun sending out beta invites yet to my knowledge. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399601782/blizz-official-email/))<br />
<br />
Cutting features from the game<br />
If you were a game developer, perhaps you'd make different choices in our shoes. It's a subjective business and if you were super passionate about guild talents, perhaps you could have come up with a model that solved all of our concerns. Sometimes those concerns are visible early and sometimes you really have to get into the meat of the implementation before you realize the problems. We think the Blizzard development model has worked pretty well for over 15 years. Part of that model is being willing to cut something (features, or even titles) that isn't working out, no matter how much effort we've put into them. Keeping a feature that didn't work but that was clearly the pet feature of some developer has marred several potentially good games. <br />
<br />
[...] As I mentioned in the above response, we have killed entire games and even game worlds before. If you go back and look at previous expansions of World of Warcraft, and certainly vanilla, there were features on the list that eventually were scrapped or changed into something completely different. As with much of our design, the alternative is not to share any information until we are 100% sure it is going to come to pass. That would mean you would know almost nothing about Cataclysm at this stage though, which would also be pretty frustrating. Every good game studio I know cuts features (and titles!) all the time.<br />
<br />
It's like sculpting in stone. It's like good writing. You carve away until what you have left is the best you can make it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399601135/please-rethink-the-guild-tree-and-path-removl/))<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
Hit and Defense Stats<br />
As I've posted before, we like hit. It's the kind of thing that makes you pay attention to your gearing, because rather than just snatch up each item that's a higher ilevel than what you currently have, you have to actually look at the stats. You can't approach every decision with &quot;I like hit, so if it has hit, I'll take it.&quot;<br />
<br />
Defense was a different beast because it was serving as a barrier to entry. Mages and hunters can run a dungeon just fine without being hit-capped. Sure their damage will be lower, but not so low that they can't handle the content. Defense wasn't designed the same way -- a tank not at the defense cap risked dying on a boss fight and literally couldn't handle the content. If we had instead taken defense and stripped off the extra avoidance and changed it so that it decreased crit damage (so it made more of a smooth curve), then we probably could have kept it, even with an eventual cap. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399931648/why-does-the-hit-stat-exist/))<br />
<br />
Stealth in Cataclysm<br />
Every rogue has the best stealth built in -- they have Master of Deception for free. Druids still have to talent Feral Instinct for it because we don't want every druid (read Balance and Restoration) to have uber stealth. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25399740838/stealth-in-cataclysm-an-inquiry/))<br />

Elemental and Restoration dual-wield in Cataclysm<br />
Elemental and Resto are going to be pretty unlikely to want to dual-wield in Cataclysm. For the most part we want them using a one-handed caster weapon and shield. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=25399741498&amp;pageNo=1&amp;sid=1#3))<br />

After all the work they've done with the LFG (looking for GROUP) you'd have thought they'd do a better job of integrating it into that.<br />
<br />
But of course it's blizzard, that'll be patch 4.3 when they engage that slow brain of theirs. Lets face it we all could have told them about Wintergrasp and how much resources a city as small as dalaran would take up... <br />
<br />
but no, they actually thought the AC tournament would be in crystal song forest and aerial units would be in Wintergrasp... [<br />
<br />
but then they've made idiotic mistakes in the past, we all remember the global LFG channel ;) or... the more popular shaman gold seller totem fun ;) or the snowball AV for afkers.<br />
<br />
of course that's when AV was enjoyable with Ivus and co stomping around... now it's just arena style combat with the PvE parts taken out. Adding reinforcements to AV killed it. Killed everything about it. <br />

blizz can fail. just luckily they have the majority of their customers in asian countries where they don't even have wotlk. <br />

But if he thinks he might be wrong, that's because the beta invites are so soon that he doesn't even know if they've been sent yet! Of course, when that happens, he'll know, but logic implies that they are so near that to his knowledge they have not yet been sent.. but might have (but havn't).. Okay, I've stopped making sense now, but you get my point.. right?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guilds are, for the most part, groups of friends. We don't want features to drive wedges between them. We don't want you to guild hop looking for the talents that suit you best; we want you to play (or in many cases keep playing) with your friends. With a talent tree, guilds would naturally have different talent trees, which creates a reason to bail or guild hop that doesn't exist today. If you didn't like the direction the guild was taking (for example, you were a PvP guy with a GM focused on raid-progression) you might feel like you should leave. That can happen today of course, but you can also stay in a PvE guild just because you like the members even if you don't participate in the same content because you're not losing out on inherent guild benefits. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, we felt like the decision-making, for many guilds, would be up to a relatively few people, possibly as few as the guild master. Talent trees work for classes because the decision is up to you. We didn't want to create the risk of drama over choosing those talents or even not being consulted in choosing them. <br />
<br />
Am going to disagree slightly, i think you can offer a degree of customerisation, while not penalising players or guilds to much.<br />
<br />
each player in a guild has a character guild talent tree, as the guild levels up extra tiers open up and you can get to spend points in activating which guild talents you want to use.<br />
<br />
All guild talents are available to all players, its just up to them to choose which ones they would like to use individually, the same as for existing class talent trees.<br />
<br />
<br />
There can also be passive bonuses, that are not on the guild talent try but are applicable to all guild members.<br />
<br />
For example a passive talent could be:<br />
<br />
10% Xp increase to all guild members<br />
<br />
or, <br />
<br />
10% more gold from mobs.<br />
<br />
<br />
You could also have guild talents that may increase these further, depending if your leveling or farming, or crafting etc.<br />
<br />
for example a talent you can spend points in could give you an extra 10% XP increase or 10% more gold.<br />
<br />
so with the passive 10% Xp increase and Active 10% XP increase this will give you a %20 overall<br />
<br />
again you get to customise your play style, leveling, farming, crafting, PvP, PvE, etc<br />
<br />
<br />
The guild wont be penalised for choosing talents in a tree, the GM or officers wont have to make a decision, there wont be any cookie cutter guild spec. It will though empower individual players to customise there playstyle without having an unfair advantage</div></div><hr />

<br />
Then come next expansion, they will quote &quot;the dwindleing numbers of guild doing 25 man has warranted dropping them entirely&quot;.<br />
<br />
Wow is in decline, guilds are struggling to keep warm bodies in raid slots let alone peeps who actully pull their weight... 10's ar FINE with me. We will once again see a rise in solid raiding guilds and there will be some REAL competition for server firsts and progression races.<br />

Saying that 25 will still be popular is just stupid. There won't be any challenge or real reason to continue gettin 25 raids together when you can make a 10man raid much easier for the same rewards. I just think it's a pathetic idea and no matter how much they say it won't, it will kill 25man progressive raiding.<br />

How legendaries will work out on a chance to obtain the items has yet to be determined. We are trying to avoid having one raid be the defacto better way to go simply based on gear and leave it up to the way players want to play.<br />
<br />
so basicly, you will get legendary items in 10 and 25 man.<br />
And if they dont wanna kill 25 man raiding (what imo wont happen, strong 25 guilds will still do 25s) they will probably make the chance to get a legendary higher in 25 man<br />
<br />
Like with the shards in ulduar (dunno about the things in icc :P) give a 75-100 % drop chance in 25 and 25-50% in 10 or something like that</div></div><hr />

There are rewards like badges/gold for the additional coordination involved, but we are trying to avoid having gear be the reason that one style is better than the other.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, more badges/gold isn't a real incentive. Those both come in time. I like 25 man raiding better than 10 but I'm not seeing a reason to keep doing 25s. Thankfully my guild is one of the top on my server so we will still run 25s.</div></div><hr />

Now let's say the up how many 25-man drops, and he drops 6 (I assume this is how it'll work. If he JUST drops more Emblems... well thats dumb) then you've seen 1/2 of his loot table in one kill.

<br />
The thing that gets me is I thought the original intent was to make 25 man raiding more efficient. I know these numbers are not set yet, but just commenting on the trend of examples. If a 10 man boss drops 3 items, and a 25 man boss drops 6, that is not more efficient. It it not even equal. The 25 man will need to drop 8 items before you see a efficiency gain.<br />
<br />
I have not seen any info yet if they will have the drops on 25 be unique or shared, so if you can see doubles of items that will statistically reduce the efficiency of 25 as well versus 10.<br />
<br />
There is a very small percentage of players that are raiding solely for fun, and will use loot to drive their decisions. If these things are not worked out 25's will take a hard hit. The ratio of loot drops is a huge factor. Also consider when people want to drop a 25 man guild and maybe go to a 10 because in the 10 they can be the ONLY Hunter and not compete with 2 others for loot like they do in a 25. That is already a factor now current raiding, but the item level disparity from 10 to 25 has gave them something to consider. In Cataclysm this will not be an issue.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adilina</div><div class="date">2010-06-15, 02:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is Blizzard sees more and more people leaving this game, with the primary reason being difficulty of finding good and stable raiding group. To retain its number of subscriptions, at least the following things are implemented or to be implemented:<br />
<br />
1) Making loot table the same for 10 and 25man raids.<br />
2) Lock each character a player has to only 1 raid per week, so that they would spend more time leveling/gearing an alt. Hopefully that can bring some new excitement to those bored players.<br />
3) Making vanity pets/mounts purchasable.<br />
4) Making raids significantly easier from expansion to expansion.<br />
<br />
I am sure the list extends beyond these points. I understand the game lives on profit. However, some of the new changes that are released so far are discouraging to elite raiding guilds. In lots of cases 25 people who come to a raid are not bound by friendship. It is the loot and glory that keep the desire. They won't tolerate seeing pugs wearing the same gear/title, riding the same mount as they do. Now it looks like the classification will become further diminished.<br />
<br />
Anyone who played this game long enough should have sensed that the hay day of WoW is long gone. The new features are poisonous solutions to me as they make players in the game less distinguishable. In real life, we all live in a world of rank and we are used to it, which keep the societal system stable and prosperous. What I see is the ranking in Cataclysm is becoming vague. Thousands of guilds have killed Lich King and they are still minority in Blizzard's eyes? Favoring the pugs who probably don't care about the game much while disappoint people who are serious is just unwise. I feel Blizzard is moving toward a lost cause.<br />
<br />
So, the end of the &quot;world&quot; is coming? Maybe at 2012.</div></div><hr />

We weren't going to prevent goblin or worgen DKs from day one. The realm first feats are cool, but I'm not sure we should let them dictate what classes people can and can't play. The entire realm first thing is over in a day or two anyway.<br />
<br />
The thread implies you guys heard something different though, possibly from the recent press event. (Source)&quot;<br />
<br />
Oh god. Expect a MASSIVE amount of Worgen DK / Goblin DK when cataclysm ships :(<br />
<br />
I usually make fun of whiners, but I feel like QQing about this as well. It's silly, but the idea of every single Worgen and Goblin server first being a DK DISGUSTS me. I'm hoping they change their mind about it.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if they are letting DKs out that early maybe the Race Change option to Worgen/Goblin will be available sooner.</div></div><hr />

To me it looks more and more that they are removing all the new potential fun and interesting things which had me really excited about cataclysm in the first place. Also with this raid change, badges and gold as an incentive to play 25man over 10man for the extra work it takes to create a good synergy for the raid and co-ordinate a larger amount of players. <br />
Maybe it's just me but the expansion just keeps losing its appeal with all these changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
yeah, cus' that will make people wanna do 25s.....<br />

What about achievement / progress ranks? If no one does 25 mans anymore, every stupid guild in the world can be the number 1 25man guild. That should spark some competition.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No one really cares about server firsts. Maybe you do for the first month of cataclysm, but not after that. You don't get anything other than a feat of strength that no one cares about. Plus, how many people have a level 80 DK already? They'd either have to delete it or pay $25 to race change, and how many are really gonna do that?<br />
<br />
I hope the caster legendary lets you pick between a sword or a mace. Daggers are super lame and they said in this very post that they want shaman to use a main hand and a shield (rather than a staff). <br />
<br />
On the topic of 25s dying, I'm starting to agree. At first, I thought that they'd take care of 25 man raiders by giving us more loot and more badges. But now they're saying that they might not even do that? I like 10 mans for one reason. They are relaxing, easy, and fun with the right people. You might think that I'd be happy about the upcoming changes but no. 10 mans are going to be progression the same way 25 mans are now. All the stress of not screwing over the raid and worrying about what guild is in first place will make it's way into 10 man raiding. IIRC, 10 mans were made so people could SEE CONTENT without having to commit to a large 25 man guild. Now they're making 10s even less accessible and taking the fun out of a relaxing &quot;who cares?&quot; atmosphere. <br />
<br />
I hate that they're forcing me to have a high level alt if I want to raid the same amount that I do now. I don't want an alt to have the same access to loot as my main. I love my mage, and if I could raid every boss an unlimited amount of times, I wouldn't have any alts now. <br />
<br />
I think the reason people are happy about 10s and 25s having the same gear is because they want the better gear of 25s without having to put in the work for it. 25 man loot is higher ilvl because 25s are harder and require better gear to deal with the challenges, not because blizzard likes 25s more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since 10s and 25s share a lockout, the same gear, and theoretically the same difficulty, I highly doubt that there will be a distinction between the top 25 man guild and the top 10 man guild. Blizzard wants to move away from that.<br />
<br />
Achievements will also probably be consolidated down to things like &quot;Kill Rotface with out him casting Unstable Ooze Explosion in 10 or 25 man difficulty.&quot; They'll have the same meta and the same 310 drake, if they continue that trend.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course people care about server firsts! Otherwise there wouldn't be a race to get the achievement. Maybe a lot of people don't care about getting it because of the time and dedication involved for a minor achievement, but seeing who does make the Feat of Strength, how they did it and what class they were was fun. A class who gets a 58 level handicap (and to a certain extent a gear handicap as well) hardly deserves the achievement. I won't lose sleep over it but it is dissapointing. <br />
<br />
I do agree about 25s dying though. I don't mind them focusing more on 10 mans now (I actually prefer it), but there should be at least something noteworthy in the 25s to make them appealing besides progression. I kinda blame the whiners who QQ'ed about &quot;having&quot; to do bosses twice and then the 10s making the 25s feel less epic or something. I'm sure they will be the first ones in 10 man dungeons in Cataclysm too, because we all know what the real discontent was about. Shame that Blizz is punishing everyone for a few spoiled manchildren, but oh well. As long as I still have a good time I'll keep paying.</div></div><hr />

I was under the impression that people raced to max level to start gearing up and raiding again. At least, that's why I did it. I suppose there could be a drive to get there first for the FoS. <br />
<br />
I also never understood why people felt they were &quot;forced&quot; to run 10 and 25s. The gear in 10s isn't better than 25s. I could understand wanting to do it for more badges, but that's only because blizzard made it so that you HAD to get badges to get the 251 t10 in order to upgrade it to the 264 t10. Wouldn't be a problem if tier was a drop like it was in naxx and ulduar, instead of making us badge farm in order to get the 25 man version of the tier. Seriously, did no one else notice this?</div></div><hr />

They simply need to be a little more careful what they do advertise and do not. Make sure what they do advertise makes it into the expansion. Things on the short list to cut if time runs out, do not advertise. If it makes it, neat, players get some unexpected extras, and if not, nobody knows.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get it either. Granted, not everyone was being this contradictory, and I'm not in any way saying WotLK is perfect, but on more than one occasion I had to faceplam at some of the &quot;logic&quot; I saw.<br />
<br />
&quot;The WotLK fights are too easy.&quot; Practice the fight to death in the PTR, run 10s for better gear, and still don't kill any HM bosses until the zone buff is as high as it is. And never click that zone buff off even though that would make it harder. K.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'm doing the same fights as in 10 man with different mechanics.&quot; Yep, now you can't even if you wanted to! Yay? <br />
<br />
Stuff like that. I can understand people wanted to be rewarded for doing 25s instead of 10s though. getting 25 people together really is a bigger pain and should be rewarded. But some of the whining is just dumb and those same people continue to whine no matter what Blizz does. At least backing up complaints with reasoning and stuff would make it easier to see their points of view, but you can imagine that doesn't happen often I'm sure.</div></div><hr />

It shouldn't be swords, as elemental shamans, priests, and boomkins can't use them...<br />

<br />
I suppose it could be a legendary staff, but then that's contrary to the idea of ele shamans being intended to wield one-handed weapons with a shield. *shrug* But I suppose when your weapon is just a stat-stick, that's a fairly moot point.</div></div><hr />

Yep, or all caster offhand weapons have states similar to the other offhands. You can't DW two 1000 SP 300 haste maces, but the best offhand mace will be 200sp with 75 haste and 69 crit. And then blizzard can be like &quot;you got it, now stfu&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Top raiding guilds may keep doing 25s. But this whole change stems from Blizzard making WoW a game for every single player. Which hurts part of the game. We have different games for a reason cause people have different tastes. But this whole raid change is from making the game more accessable.<br />
<br />
The sad part is we won't know how badly this will screw people over till it goes live. They should of just left it as is. Why make a change that will divide people just don't make it at all.<br />
<br />
One thing though, in 10 your chances of getting a BiS item are lower since 10 will drop say 2 items and 25 will drop say 5 items. Since the boss loot tables will be the same size in both 10/25. The chances of a BiS item dropping more often each week will always be greater in 25.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By &quot;full group&quot; I'd expect it to mean &quot;the size of the group for each side in each BG&quot; so that would mean 10, 15 or 40 (25 was probably, hopefully, thinking too much about PvE raids).<br />
<br />
As for people being carried that happens in all aspects of the game to some extent. Hopefully players' BG rating will gave some way of figuring out how much a player contributed to each objective. If not, it'll be as bad as you're suggesting.<br />
<br />
For everything else:<br />
* Legendary Weapon: Has to be a Dagger (it's the only 1-handed weapon type that all caster classes can use) and has to be in 10 and 25 or they might as well stick with the same system they have now.<br />
* Raid Progress: I'd still prefer there to be some way of rewarding the players who choose to put more time and effort into their characters but, if there was, it would be seen as 'required' and &quot;unfair to players that choose to do other things with their time&quot; so it won't happen.<br />
* Amount of gear in 10 &amp; 25 main raids: There are currently 9 'boxes' for armor types:<br />
1. Cloth Caster Dps: Mages, Warlocks, Shadow Priests<br />
2. Cloth Healer: Discipline and Holy Priests<br />
3. Leather Physical Tanks and Dps: Feral Druids (Bear and Cat) and Rogues.<br />
4. Leather Caster Dps and Healer: Balance and Restoration Druids<br />
5. Mail Physical Dps: Hunters and Enhancement Shaman.<br />
6. Mail Caster Dps and Healer: Elemental and Restoration Shaman.<br />
7. Plate Tanking: Blood Death Knights, Protection Paladins and Protection Warriors.<br />
8. Plate Physical Dps: Frost / Unholy Death Knights, Retribution Paladins and Arms / Fury Warriors.<br />
9. Plate Healer: Holy Paladin.<br />
Pick 1 character from each box, then 1 random. There's your 10-man group with only a single case of overlap.<br />
* Incentive for 25-mans: The only incentive that ever existed to do 25-mans rather than 10-mans, for the majority of players, was gear. The minority were always the players that enjoyed 25-mans.<br />
* Guild Perks / Levelling: It would've been cracked by EJ in a week, at most. Still a shame though.<br />
* Worgen / Goblin DKs and server first Level 85s: These do actually matter to some people as a little badge to say &quot;I was first&quot;. If I could, I'd like one, but I won't cry because I came 2nd, 3rd, or 12,003rd.<br />
* Cutting features: If you keep adding new features the game never gets released. That's half the reason we have patches. Eventually you have to stop, step back and say &quot;this is what we'll give them&quot;. After that you can start thinking about what you can give next.<br />
* Hit &amp; Def: GC's argument isn't concrete because different stats have different values of 'good' to each character. Nobody should ever be able to look at an item and go &quot;it has a bigger iLevel, so I'll take it&quot; unless the difference is huge (e.g. at least a tier).<br />
* Stealth: I hate rogues and the idea of players having stealth from each other so I'm not going to comment on this.<br />
* DW Shaman: As somebody else suggested: Make all caster weapons Main Hand instead of One-Handed and give Shamans DW as a basic ability.<br />

Edit: They don't even need to change much to Main Hand. According to Allakhazam (Wowhead isn't working for some reason) there are 5 One-Handed weapons with spellpower: Blade of the New Moon, Flarethorn, Remorse (from the Kael'thas TK fight), Sceptor of the Unholy and Valiant Shortsword. Change those 5 weapons from One-Handed to Main Hand and nobody can Dual Wield caster weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you can put the time/effort into something, why shouldn't you be rewarded? I know it's a game, but the same can be said about anything in the world. they don't want the game to feel grindy? then develop content that's actually challenging and takes time to get through, rather than artificial limits on ones time investment.</div></div><hr />

Remember, when the game felt truly epic?<br />
<br />
Say yes to another tanking legendary.<br />
<br />
Would help if legendarys even felt legendary anymore, TF and somewhat for Atiesh were the only ones to pull it off.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Donating money to have someone play video games? Hell, I PAY to play video games, not ask people to pay money so that I can play them.<br />
<br />
They are speed running or doing games through 100% which most people cant be bothered to even attempt but are interested in watching, there also are people who played these games years and years ago that just enjoy watching the games and those that like to play along.<br />
<br />
They aren't asking people to pay them to play they are asking people to donate and giving them reasons to donate through various methods, its not like they are forcing people to pay to watch if you don't feel what they are doing is a good enough reason than you don't have to.<br />
<br />
Its just a shame they wont be doing another final fantasy marathon anytime soon :(.<br />
<br />
Its funny though they aren't even asking for much, 50k may sound alot for 1 person but when they have 20000 people watching at one time thats $2.5 per person even donating $1 from everyone that has watched the stream so far would probably be enough.<br />
<br />
Maybe that is too much for some people.</div></div><hr />

Sorry but I will never donate money to any charity ever again. Nobody knows where the money goes or how efficiently it is handled and it happened so often that money went missing or went to &quot;bad people&quot; (warlords etc.).<br />
<br />
I however think that what those gamers do is pretty great and creative. And prolly better than doing nothing ;D<br />
<br />

&quot;Lucas<br />
From age 4-10, Lucas has been in the hospital 10 times short-term and 2 times long-term (18-24 months). Lucas is on a special diet. The special diet is difficult for the family financially but Lucas has made more gains since starting the diet 6 months ago than he has in years. Mom is unable to work because of Lucas (he missed 16 weeks of school last year) and her own health issues (she has Lupus, fibromyalgia, and Syndrome X). Family’s sole income has been social security survivor benefits from Dad passing away in 2005. Mom recently had 2 emergency surgeries.<br />
Requesting $5,000 for supplements and special diet food&quot;<br />
<br />
makes me wonder why many Americans are still proud of their system (assuming that family lives in the USA, if not then nvm).</div></div><hr />

There are rewards like badges/gold for the additional coordination involved, but we are trying to avoid having gear be the reason that one style is better than the other.<br />

<br />
The point the bliz guy was making is that it will NOT be a dagger because they are small, and they want something larger so that they can make it look awesome :O<br />
<br />
Not to mention the post also says it probably wont be the first riad instance either but your comment says it probably will.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And thats why i pointed out that you don't have to pay to watch they generally do stupid things to get people to donate more but no one in any way is holding a gun to your head forcing you to donate.<br />
<br />
However i am now quite suspicious of the speed gamers motives.<br />
<br />
I mean for all we know they could be financing some kind of mutant death squad hell bent on destroying the world using puppies made of raspberries.<br />
<br />
Whatever they are upto it surely must be something sinister.</div></div><hr />

Given the equality of reward, there is literally zero reason to opt to run 25 man unless your guild currently has a roster to support it. Once people leave, or new guilds are formed, it is going to be so much more convenient to form a 10 man raid that nobody will bother with 25 man, everybody knows it's very hard to find 25 people with the required skill, people aren't going to deliberately handicap themselves for long.<br />
<br />
Whether for it or against it, people will not do something inherently more difficult (even if somehow just logistically) for the same potential outcome, this change WILL make 25 man incredibly niche if the only rewards are gold and a bit of saved dungeon finder time.<br />
<br />
I'm not arguing for or against here but surely Blizzard realizes this?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sabelas</div><div class="date">2010-06-16, 02:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, Blizzard never did say that the first legendary coming in Cataclysm would be in the first tier content of raiding for Cataclysm. All they said was that the first legendary of Cataclysm would be for casters. Now coming to what the legendary might be and most likely will be, is a dagger, for obvious reasons that were all stated in previous posts, even though I would like to see a sword, because they usually are better looking than daggers.<br />
<br />
By the way, the PTR is currently showing a release build. So, if everything goes correctly and no last minute problems happen, we can probably expect 3.3.5 to be dropped on 6/22 for the US, with the entire patch (including RS coming available) for EU on 6/29-30.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">smokinghooka</div><div class="date">2010-06-17, 06:44 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">nope, the problem is that you can hit a cap and then it is useless, but now with reforging you can ease that pain so this shouldn't be too big of an issue<br />
<br />
my biggest issue with hit is, that your cap is dynamic depending on raid composition.</div></div><hr />
