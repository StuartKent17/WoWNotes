Patch 5.4.8 Live This Week<br />
It looks like Patch 5.4.8 will be going live tomorrow, so be sure to get your weekly Valor cap tonight! <br />
<br />
Our friends over at AskMrRobot (http://www.askmrrobot.com/) have a nice tool to tell you which items are the best to upgrade first, which anyone can use with the one week trial or Premium. There are also lots of Flex, Normal, and Heroic Siege of Orgrimmar raids posted over on OpenRaid (http://openraid.us/events) for this week to take advantage of the new upgrade levels. <br />
<br />
We recently (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3984-Armory-Stats-Siege-of-Orgrimmar-Progression-Blue-Tweets-DLC-439) looked at how Siege of Orgrimmar progression is going for the playerbase. Everyone being able to earn 8 more item levels should boost that some, and we will take a look again in a month or two.<br />
<br />
Item Upgrade Changes<br />
<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar loot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=17056&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-quality=16) and the legendary cloaks (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-patch=17056&amp;filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-quality=32) can now be upgraded two more times, for a total of four upgrades. The cost of upgrading is unchanged.<br />
Heirloom weapons (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/weapons?filter-reqlvl-min=90&amp;filter-quality=128) from Garrosh have had their item levels increased by 8. (Example (http://www.wowdb.com/items/105685/#18224-18273))<br />
<br />
<br />
Valor Changes<br />
<br />
You can purchase Deeds of Valor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/112353-deeds-of-valor) for 3000 x Timeless Coin (http://ptr.wowdb.com/currencies/777-timeless-coin) from Mistweaver Ai (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/73305-mistweaver-ai). <br />
Deeds of Valor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/112353-deeds-of-valor) won't allow you to go over the weekly / total Valor caps, as they are just an alternative way to earn Valor.<br />
<br />
<br />
Unofficial Changes<br />
<br />
Gaze of the Black Prince (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/161780-gaze-of-the-black-prince) and Heart of the Valorous (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/161795-heart-of-the-valorous) aren't in the notes, and it looks like how they will work will be announced at a later date (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/468568209629917185).<br />
The Grinning Reaver (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/163025-grinning-reaver) is not in the official notes.<br />
The Warforged Nightmare (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/163024-warforged-nightmare) (Nightmarish Hitching Post (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/112324-nightmarish-hitching-post)) is not in the official notes, but was teased as a mount that is used with friends (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3939-New-Fiery-Mechanical-Mount-Coming-Soon-Flying-in-Warlords-of-Draenor).<br />

Patch 5.4.8 Official Notes<br />
Classes<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid<br />
<br />
Resolved an issue where Cat Form's movement speed bonus was stacking incorrectly with Warrior's Stampeding Shout.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue<br />
<br />
Burst of Speed can now be activated to remove movement-slowing effects even if another movement speed bonus such as Sprint is already present (the speed bonuses will still not stack).<br />
<br />
<br />
Raids, Dungeons, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Siege of Orgrimmar<br />
<br />
General Nazgrim<br />
<br />
General Nazgrim no longer calls in an additional wave of forces at 10% health on Raid Finder difficulty.<br />
<br />
Garrosh Hellscream<br />
<br />
Increased berserk timer for Garrosh Hellscream to 25 minutes (up from 18 minutes) on Raid Finder difficulty.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
All upgradable epic quality items introduced in Patch 5.4 (items found in Siege of Orgrimmar and Timeless Isle) are now eligible to be upgraded an additional 2 times for a total increase of 16 item levels.<br />
Heirloom weapons awarded by Garrosh Hellscream have been increased by 8 item levels to keep them competitive with the additional 2 upgrade levels given to other items.<br />
Mistweaver Ai (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/73305-mistweaver-ai) on the Timeless Isle next to the Celestial Court now sells a token called Deeds of Valor (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/112353-deeds-of-valor) for 3000 Timeless Coins. When used, Deeds of Valor grants 100 Valor Points to the character, up to the 1000 Valor Point maximum per week.<br />
For additional details behind this change, please check out the forum thread titled: Gear Changes in Patch 5.4.8 (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12673849748).<br />
<br />
<br />
UI<br />
<br />
UI Add-Ons are no longer able to update a number of CVars while the player is in combat. A complete listing of CVars affected by this change can be found in the forum thread titled: 5.4.8 Changes to CVars While In-Combat (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12674209697).<br />
<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
<br />
Going to Need a Bigger Bag (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/8728-going-to-need-a-bigger-bag) is now an account-wide achievement and items obtained by all characters on the account now contribute credit towards completion. This means the achievement can be completed by obtaining all the required items across multiple characters instead of having a single character obtain all the items needed.<br />

why army of the dead be instant? It's so cool when they rise from the ground slowly, it's all about the cool animation.<br />

https://t.co/EEjkCalz3W looks like a ravager. Please let there be a hunter pet version. As a bug lover, I beg you. ;_;<br />

Dont want to turn shaman into a pet class. Give him another elemental in WoD. Make totally sense -.-<br />
It does, actually. A temporary guardian that you can talent into is very different from a pet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466654880161988608))<br />
<br />
What do u think about GhostWolf?Its useless without glyph.Wasnt ur goal with WoD to delete such skills / make them useful again?<br />
Ghost Wolf is objectively not useless. It may not be as useful as you want, in the situations that you want, but that != useless. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466655030016106496))<br />
What about tweaking GW to make it more in line with the sprints, blinks, leaps and teleports almost every class has?<br />
That's simply not what Ghost Wolf is. You want it to be a different tool than it is and is intended to be. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466661140903104512))<br />

will felgaurd cease to be the goto pet for demo? Removing brostorm , axe toss and pursuit? Will there be a new cool demo pet?<br />
All of those are currently planned to stay. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466369698385649664))<br />
will demo suffer from not being able to sac pets? Or will there be a benefit to pet having increased crit<br />
I'm not sure I understand the question. There's indeed a benefit to your pet having increased crit... it crits more. (?) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466370319935373315))<br />
crit for doom is a big part of our damage. Why sac it for pet increased damage? Unless there is a sweet benefit unknown to us<br />
Remember, there's no more snapshotting. Yes, you'll get fewer Doom crits, but the Wild Imps from those Doom crits will do more. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466373353193082881))<br />
Its tuning is extremely rough currently, but think of it as -10% crit for you, +60% crit for your pets/guardians. That's big. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466373808400908289))<br />
thanks for the quick reply. Us locks thought we were on the ignore list on the WoD info dumps lately XD we have so many ?'s<br />
I keep hearing that, and don't know why. Warlocks are not getting ignored; no idea why some think they are. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466374932356923395))<br />

Character / Items<br />
what happens to asian realms? Does it stay at 2/4 or does it bump up to 2/6?<br />
25-player raid loot in Asian ruleset servers will bump up to a max of 6 VP upgrades, from the previous 4 they already had. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466434606036967424))<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
What will you guys do with the Ahead of the Curve and Cutting Edge achievements? Just curious.<br />
Those will be unavailable in patch 6.0 and not prior, as announced here: http://t.co/l1z3RZ9iPJ (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466434912435064833))<br />
Wasn't the original intent of the FoS to do content pre-nerf? This is an obvious nerf directly to SoO. <br />
The intent of the FoS was for doing the content while current. It's still current. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466435841087520771))<br />
Well I'm just recalling when they were first introduced in t14, but I guess it's a different philosophy now<br />
To an extent, though the text of the achievements has always read (paraphrased) &quot;...before the next tier.&quot; (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466440323875745792))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Are some SoO fights (Thok prime example) getting tweaked to accomodate the diminish of raid CDs?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/466385045574647810))<br />
<br />
This is a gigantic nerf to the difficulty of the content. I can't even fathom what difference 8 raid ilvls will make. Bad move.<br />
It's about an 8% &quot;nerf&quot; that will take effect gradually over weeks. It's nothing compared to 30% ICC/DS. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466599750436155395))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
are gear changes (http://t.co/scRvQTN2qU) being applied to pvp gear as well? if so, what currency will plyers upgrade gear with?<br />
PvP gear will remain as is (no upgrades). PvE Ilevel ceiling will still top out at 540 in Instanced PvP. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/466439998179639296))<br />
<br />
If gear will scale up to minimum ilvl in BGs, will that minimum ilvl increase each season?<br />
yes it will increase each season (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/466620680235384833))<br />
<br />
With 4/4 upgrades to pve gear coming, that basically reverts what u were doing with 550 prideful gear to make competive in WPVP..gg<br />
I don't think 8 item levels completely negates it but I understand that perception (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/466606020047806464))<br />
PvE item levels always seem to scale higher than PvP.<br />
Clashing design goals. 4 tiers of PvE &amp; new gear should feel stronger. PvP doesn't want big difference between honor/conquest. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/466624613611352065))<br />
As a result we're changing things pretty drastically in Warlords. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/466624745132158976))<br />
so you're giving pve players a new goal to keep them in game, what about PvPers what do we get? Any love for us? :3<br />
When we announced season 15, I got a lot of tweets like this one but with PvP and PvE reversed. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/466648382736302081))<br />
<br />
World<br />
Any chance you'll make the 5.0 MoP rares (Like Krol the Blade) like the Timeless Isle ones instead of being a campers paradise?<br />
Yes, there's a very different sort of gameplay with rares spread across the entire world vs. clustered in a small high-pop area. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466600482841329665))<br />
Something to expect in 5.4.8 or 6.0?<br />
In Warlords. 5.4.8 isn't a content patch, just fixing bugs (and giving us an opportunity to tweak a couple of things like Valor) (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/466604787673628672))</div></div><hr />

Complain about no content? sounds like something to complain about to me. But if people try to complain blizz responds with &quot;well we are working hard to release the next expansion soon trademark :) because we say this shit so much, and have no way to justify releasing an expansion with the least amount of content ever, some more bullshit, blah blah blah keep paying for a game with nothing new for another year or more&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
They also knew the info about these two things were datamined weeks ago and they never once said &quot;This won't be in the patch&quot; but instead wait until the night before and go &quot;hey btw this isn't in it&quot; as players grab their torches and pitchforks. <br />
<br />
I'm not annoyed at the fact it's not included but more by the fact they just decided to say something literally hours before it's release.</div></div><hr />

Well this patch is sort of better than nothing and yes Blizz could have done something a lot better and true lately the crap coming from Blizz is a lot more than before (I now think that GC was smart getting out when he did) but at this point IRDGAF.. Still on the fence with WoD not even done the pre order thing could this be the swan song for WoW who knows and really meh atm..</div></div><hr />

Keeping the 1000 vp /week cap makes conversion from coins to vp useless. If you did your basic SoO flex/normal run and a random dungeon every day you got you vp without even noticing so earning your 1000 vp/week isn`t really a problem. <br />
If they really wanted to help people catchup on legionaries they would have raised the cap to 3000.</div></div><hr />

That was the one thing I was looking forward to this patch and they wait until the last second to tell everyone it's not in. I mean really, this late in the xpac with absolutely no new content in sight, the least they could do is let people get the legendary faster. But of course not, keeping the delay and the valor cap at 1k weekly instead of a hard cap of 3k at any given time is the only way they are going to drag out the content.

lol..you realize how stupid you look?<br />
<br />
You see quests, raids, dungeons, new maps? Blizzard was talking about CONTENT patches.. ie.. Ruby Sanctum. What they said is that any time they used to create quests, raids, dungeons or maps would just delay WoD by an equal amount of time. In other words, a 5.5 patch. is this labelled 5.5?</div></div><hr />

If you have BiS gear, it's awesome to have the chance to upgrade your gear even further and to have something to farm again after being stuck with SoO for months. But for those who want to gear up it's even more difficult now. Experienced groups will only want to pug with players who have an even higher minimum ilvl than they expect at the moment. And even more people won't bother with enchants/gems anymore now until they get their BiS pieces. Because who on earth wants to upgrade their temporary gear now if you need 1000 VP to max out a single piece? It costs 17-18 weeks (depending on 1h or 2h weapons) to max out your ilvl on gear now with those changes. Who wants to farm at least 17 weeks of valor for their temporary gear only to start all over again once they have their BiS set? <br />
<br />
TL;DR: If a new player wants to get a BiS set, he/she has to spend at least 36 weeks on upgrading their temporary and BiS equipment before finally being able to starting to 'enjoy' their BiS set. Too bad they probably even won't get to that point at all, even if they dedicate themselves to farming for 36 weeks in a row, as WoD will hit sometime before that.<br />
<br />
TL;DR2: Blizzard feeds the elitist players while newcomers will have to hunger until WoD. The gap between new/casual and elitist player is once again becoming wider. I have nothing against elitism, (I love it), but at least make it possible for new/casual players to become elitist by performance and not through several months of forced VP farming. <br />

what u descirbe is one side of coin - there also another way to look at it - this patch is reward for people who stayed subbed in game - those will have their quality of gameplay improved- yes new players will have it harder yes those who are returning from unsubbing will have it a bit harder but guess what - its a good thing - maybe next time they wont unsub if they see the carrot on the stick- this patch is reward for loyal customers <br />
<br />
and pugs haveing more itlv - its not nessesarily a bad thing - this will improve the quality of pugs and filtrate all &quot;lfr heroes&quot; out of good pugs - yes this sounds elitest etc etc but if someone chooses lfr as his home he should stick to it - they had 8 months to go do higher difficulties - they can always make their own groups for 510 itlv players and play in their own enviroment not look for carry and then whine about failed groups when thers too many lfr idiots in those who got a bit of ordos loot.</div></div><hr />

The new player should stop being an idiot and upgrade all non warforged raid gear he can get while prioritizing warforged drops unless they are slots with carppy budget (rings, wrists etc).<br />
<br />
99% of all people will never see BiS in this game, the sooner they realize that and stop hoping for it the sooner they can make the best of what they have, USE that for progress and focus on movement and skill instead.</div></div><hr />

Welcome to every expansion since the achievement system was put in the game?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've hit enrage in their on my lock. I was killing the siege engineers and every time I got back from that a wolf rider was casting his chain heal. I think I killed 7/8 engineers and we eventually hit enrage shortly into the last phase. The whole room gets a reddish tint and the tanks got gibbed. Then someone types &quot;OMG CR THE TANKS YOU NOOBS!&quot;<br />
<br />
Fun times.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Still? I thought it topped out at 532?<br />
<br />
It goes up by 1 per week until it reaches 540.<br />

I'm pretty sure every CE has awarded a special achievement?</div></div><hr />

Lets face it, you will need 1000VP for one item ( 4x upgrade ) that means 16 weeks of valor cap if you havent upgraded any item so far. Considering that i play with OS as well ( even if my os gear is upgraded ) I will need 16weeks of capping. That is way too long. They should make the cap higher to at least 2000Vp or perhaps 3000VP. Even if there is 3000VP weekly cap you will still need a month to upgrade your gear..</div></div><hr />

<br />
I got the achievement for the pet only. I have both (obviously, since I got the pet achieve). I did try logging both horde and alliance, and actually mounting up. <br />
<br />
Also, for the timeless isle collection achievement... on all my toons, the achievement progress is now blank. Did they just reset this? I was hoping it would combine all current progress. I really don't want to camp all those damn pets again :mad::mad::mad:</div></div><hr />
