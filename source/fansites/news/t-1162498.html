The copper rod, yes. That's the Enchanting Supplier selling those. But the later generations of rods required as you level up Enchanting, including the newest version, those are the ones being a pain getting on test servers. Hence this change.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why did power word solace get a nerf? Holy priests mana regen without the talent was pretty broken. If the talent is nerfed, there should be a more decent alternative for mana regen.<br />
<br />
I understand the direction they are going with this, but there really needs to be a alternative for our mana regen other than power word solace.<br />
<br />
because it mana regen was way more cost effective vs mindbender and FDCL</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc03779e49a8</div><div class="date">2012-07-18, 10:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think these changes will solve the &quot;Mandatory&quot;-Problems of T15/T30/T45 in the paladin talent tree... although now SoL could be viable, but IMO PoJ will just be stronger overall and LAotL when it comes to mobility on demand. Nerfing Repetance by adding an annoying cooldown does not address the issue, that even a CC with a small cooldown will be better than no CC. Buffing SS's SP scaling doesn't address the issue, that Selfless Healer is still a very good throughput talent but also and even more important a great mana longevity talent. So, nothing will change.</div></div><hr />

Wait, enchanting rods are actual problems for people when they're leveling? Really? <br />

If they are removing all the existing rods, they might as well rename the first (and only) one to &quot;Runed Enchanting Rod&quot;. No point having the various minerals in the name now, is there?<br />
<br />
Blizz keep all rods in game (as I understand) you can even use them still. You just can't make new ones.<br />

<br />
This is a tooltip change only. The MMO-C wording is incorrect on 2 levels. <br />
<br />
1. Chaos Bolt never double dipped on mastery, as the tooltip suggested (thus the change).<br />
2. Chaos Bolt is an &quot;ember consuming spell&quot;, so it still benefits from the second part of Mastery: Emberstorm.</div></div><hr />

Why not make a suggestion that BS requirement from keys should be removed? It's actually kind of stupid, that you need to be BS to even use a key (to unlock the chest).<br />
<br />
----------<br />
<br />
Removing all rods from the reach of the enchanters is just a lazy approach. Instead of doing a &quot;clean-up&quot; of a profession (which should be done!), Blizz just removes &quot;the annoyances&quot;, like head enchant and/or a choice which quest reward to take. /:rolleyes:</div></div><hr />

It can be a pain getting a new rod made on any test server, but not really an issue on Live.<br />
<br />
I recently levelled up enchanting on my low pop server. As it turned out, I was forced to level a toon with full blacksmithing as well because rods weren't available on the AH. <br />
<br />
Sure I could have spent a load of time spamming trade with &quot;LF BS&quot; but I found it easier to just level a Blacksmith than go through that pain.<br />
<br />
Getting away with rod requirements is well overdue these days.</div></div><hr />

Instead of totally doing away with the rod, which is basically what happens when you drop it to a copper rod, how about something like this. <br />
<br />
On the Enchanting Supplies vendor, add in new levels of rods. These would be base mats. Call em sticks, base them off different types of wood or something. Doesn't matter, but instead of a Enchanters need of a Blacksmith to get a rod, the 'rod' is on the vendor.<br />
<br />
Then for that level, say for cataclysm, the enchanter has to 'enchant' the rod with current content materials. Say the base mats that cover the contents green items and low ilvl blues. I dunno, say 10 dusts, 5 lesser essences, 2 greater essences and 1 shard.<br />
<br />
POOF!<br />
<br />
Make your rod. <br />
<br />
It'll keep enchanting like it is and it'll make it easier to simply remove the requirement to rely on the AH or a Blacksmith for the profession. Could even have to make another rod to handle the 'end game' enchants. Double the mats and add in a Crystal or two. That is a minor QoL improvement that doesn't gut the uniqueness of the profession.</div></div><hr />
