<br />
in Dalaran over broken shore, you could get contracts to que for alliance in BGS, if you were horde, and vice versa, if your alliance you could que for Horde bgs,<br />
<br />
this was a merc buff so you could effectively scale BG ques.</div></div><hr />

I read it as an iteration of the PvP mercenary mode that I believe has been around for a while now...<br />

<br />
Lol what? The fathoms deck was actually quite strong. Especially for Melee specs. It needed a nerf. <br />
<br />
By your own logic should you get a refund on every BoE you spend gold on just because it got a little nerf?<br />
<br />
Literally complaining for the sake of it rather than anything else. The deck was extremely strong. The other decks were considerably weak. Simple balancing to put them all in line.</div></div><hr />

They are tied to class hall mounts. They have transmog. They have an achievement. They have more. They provide good xp for leveling. There's no reason to remove them.</div></div><hr />

It's a blurb at the end of a post containing other game information (like patch notes). Why is this something worth getting worked up over...? I thought it was kinda interesting; lots of people like to play the Where Have I Heard/Seen Them Before? game.</div></div><hr />

That's the thing! Finally the site got some inspiration and good idea to beef up their wow site and maximize their content or atleast patronize or give support to homegrown forumers who keep their discussion board interesting instead of sofocating them instead.</div></div><hr />

I really don't know what your point is. I was talking about merc contracts. Even if I wasn't my comment made no sense in regards to invasions so I'm not sure why you're quoting me.</div></div><hr />

You also quoted the comment &quot;They are tied to class hall mounts. They have transmog. They have an achievement. They have more. They provide good xp for leveling. There's no reason to remove them.&quot; which was about invasions. My mistake, I missed the first part. Thought you were replying to the invasion post.</div></div><hr />
