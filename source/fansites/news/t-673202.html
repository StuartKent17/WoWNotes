Patch 3.3 - New Totems<br />
A lot of shamans yelled at me because I posted a video of the new totems for dwarves and not for orcs and trolls. Fixed. Note: Dwarves Shamans will NOT be available with the patch, only the totems were included here. You will have to wait for the expansion to play one. <br />

Auction House (Mini) Guide Part 3 - Prospecting!<br />
It's monday! Time for a small addition to the ever popular Auction House guides! If you missed the first 2 posts make sure you take a look at it (even if it's not really needed) <br />
<br />
Auction House Guide - Introduction and Enchanting (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/auction-house-guide-vanish-bugs-comics/)<br />
Auction House Guide - Inscription (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/auction-house-guide-inscription/)<br />
<br />
Today I'm just going to point out how simple it can be to make money with little effort, the only thing you will need is a Jewelcrafter.<br />
<br />
Just head to the Auction House and check the price of Thorium Ore (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/10620/thorium-ore/), then check the prices of <br />
<br />
Large Opal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/12799/large-opal/)<br />
Star Ruby (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/7910/star-ruby/)<br />
Azerothian Diamond (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/12800/azerothian-diamond/)<br />
Blue Sapphire (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/12361/blue-sapphire/)<br />
Huge Emerald (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/12364/huge-emerald/)<br />
<br />
That's the 5 gems you will get when you prospect Thorium, the interesting thing is ... on most servers, their value is much higher than what it costs to prospect them from ore bought at the Auction House. In the past people commented on my guides to point out that I play on a crazy server and that everything I write is useless on any other server. I'll just use Wowhead's average prices this time: Thorium price is 40G a stack, gems are :<br />
<br />
Large Opal (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12799) - 20G<br />
Star Ruby (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12364) - 20G<br />
Azerothian Diamond (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12800) - 15G<br />
Blue Sapphire (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=12361) - 10G<br />
Huge Emerald (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=7910) - 5G<br />
<br />
The average price of these 5 gems is 14G, you have a pretty high chance to get 2 of them (probably 30%) but I'll just assume that you're very unlucky and always get one. 4 gems at an average price of 14G will sell for 56G ... That's a 40% profit just for pushing the &quot;prospect&quot; key. <br />
<br />
The profit is much higher most of the time because you get more than one gem but I don't really like to theorycraft about that kind of stuff, if you need a spreadsheet to figure out if it's worth doing it, the profit is already too low and you shouldn't do it (or you really suck at maths but let's pretend you're all smart!)<br />
<br />
You can also expand that to a few more ores, but Thorium is usually the most profitable. (You will also need to wait a few days before actually doing that, because everyone on your server saw this guide and relisted the Thorium at 300% of its original price)<br />
<br />
Yes, that's it. The title says (Mini) guide for a reason and I thought it was a pretty good way to point out how easy it is to make gold from the AH without any effort. (And the Thorium trick is actually VERY profitable on the long run, you should be able to pull 200~300G/day out of this without too much problem)<br />

About 4 months ago (pre JC nerf) I was typically prospecting thorium ore and making 80+% profit however post JC nerf with less people leveling JC and less demand thorium prospecting has become a much less profitable venture. Additionally many of the people leveling JC noticed this price anomaly while leveling and the excess supply combined has driven the price on the gems down somewhat significantly.<br />
<br />
Its a neat trick but because it is so simple the number of players in the market is much higher then something significantly more complex like inscription. Don't get me wrong its still more profitable then dailies and farming but its overall profitability is not particularly impressive.</div></div><hr />

Tbh, I didn't really notice any difference on AH at all. Regular undercutting and price levels, just as they stood for a long while now. If anything, that week after your inscription guide was posted, I've hit a new personal record in daily profit, but that has more to do with exceptionally low herb prices that week (I managed to secure a huge supply of adder's tongue herbs at only 10g a stack (regular EU-GB prices tend to go around 17-20g, depending on day).</div></div><hr />

Before any of these guides:<br />
inscription: most glyphs below 10g, many of them below 5g.<br />
thorium ore stacks: 80g, all the rubies and stuff you get from prospecting: 3-10g</div></div><hr />

what i don't understand is why did you teach a monkey brained to use some of the easyest and best methods of making money. I mean common, you can tell them to enchant, prospect, craft... But you also tell them step by step how to configure Auctionner? If they can't do that, they shouldn't deserve to use it.<br />
All economy is blown on my server after this AH guides, and all stupid players in search of fast money are now selling everything at very low prices and buy any raw material at uber high prices. The only ones who get money now are the farmers.<br />
I can't evan believe glyphs originally sold at 20 g are now at 60 silver? wtf a stack of herbs is 20 g and they sell final product(recipe from research) at 60 silver each. To make a decent profit you should get 40 glyphs. That means 80 damn pigments which are never gonna come from one stack of herbs.<br />
The only profession still decent was prospecting and now... Good Job Boub you just earned a few more visitors who will never return for news or forums talk because they don't have enough brain to figure by themselves how to make decent gold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The main problem is that these guides are making it rather difficult for everyday people that aren't out to have the most money. How long is the price on Thorium Ore going to be more ridiculous than it already is because people saw this news post today? How many people that were too lazy to mine it before will be trying to go out and mine it now, which you would think would lower the price, but the supply is static and with people mining it for actual use (especially if they can't afford the new spike in price), the price will rise even more.<br />
<br />
Sorry, but Boub needs some economics lessons before he goes and post more guides. He also needs some common sense to realize that what he's doing this for himself under a very specific set of circumstances really doesn't apply to all realms economies, but his advice does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sounds like you're the one that needs the economics lesson if you truly believe that these guides have any significant effect on any realm longterm. There's a reason global averages exist. The only thing 'wrong' here is if Boub actually believes he's helping the people that had no clue how to do this to begin with. There's always personal decision-making and time investment, no addon does that for you. Every single person posting here that thinks this is ruining their economy and taking away from their profits clearly isn't making much of a profit now anyway.</div></div><hr />

what i don't understand is why did you teach a monkey brained to use some of the easyest and best methods of making money. I mean common, you can tell them to enchant, prospect, craft... But you also tell them step by step how to configure Auctionner? If they can't do that, they shouldn't deserve to use it.<br />
All economy is blown on my server after this AH guides, and all stupid players in search of fast money are now selling everything at very low prices and buy any raw material at uber high prices. The only ones who get money now are the farmers.<br />
I can't evan believe glyphs originally sold at 20 g are now at 60 silver? wtf a stack of herbs is 20 g and they sell final product(recipe from research) at 60 silver each. To make a decent profit you should get 40 glyphs. That means 80 damn pigments which are never gonna come from one stack of herbs.<br />
The only profession still decent was prospecting and now... Good Job Boub you just earned a few more visitors who will never return for news or forums talk because they don't have enough brain to figure by themselves how to make decent gold.<br />

Another leech alert... because you've NEVER read anything about optimized specs, rotations, gear, quest grinding... you live only in the vacuum of your pitiful AH trading existence. Amirite?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Posts like this one, (there's others I just didn't feel the need to copy them down) are not very well thought out. People need to realize that the economy and people themselves mimic Real Life. What do I mean by that? I'll explain:<br />
<br />
In Real Life, anyone anywhere can open up a business with the right tools. Anyone anywhere can play the stock market with the initiative, education and a little bit of luck. Everyone in a Capitalistic society has the ability and freedom to start a company or sell a product/idea. Does everyone DO it though? No. The majority of the people are lazy, unmotivated, uneducated or just don't want to put the effort into it over a long term. Therefore, only those people who actively seek to start their own business/sell product/play stock market are doing so. <br />
<br />
Just like in Real Life, people in WoW all fall into those same categories. Anyone could play the AH at any time in the last 5 years, this is nothing new. Did people do it? Well, just like my Real Life example, only those people who weren't lazy, weren't stupid and were actually committed to a long term investment were the ones playing the AH. Could anyone, anywhere at any time jump in and start? Absolutely. <br />
<br />
With these guides, that is all still the same. Nothing has changed. All of these people who could, at any point in time, have jumped in, still have the option to jump in, the only difference is now they are slightly more educated. And yet those people &quot;on the top&quot; or those who are making a profit do not want this. They want the guides taken down and complain that the education is hurting their ability to make money. <br />
<br />
That's the equivalent of Fortune 500 companies demanding colleges begin ceasing to teach Economic/banking/business classes because it educates the people, which might make their monetary gain go down if those newly educated people decide to build competition or invest smarter, etc etc. That's....pretty fucked up if you ask me. <br />
<br />
This guide hasn't changed anything. Even those people who didn't before play the AH, but are now trying to with the assistance of this guide doesn't change anything. Sure, you may see an increase of sales on the AH or a jump in prices for a few days or weeks, but even if that happens the Staus Quo will return before you know it. The unmotivated people will lose interest after too long realizing that they have to do it for a long time and stop, the uneducated people will lose money and stop, or the lazy people just won't try it. The small minority of those that DO continue with it and DO stick around and begin making a profit are nothing more than the normal thing called Competition, which is what makes up the majority of the idea of Capitalism, that being in competition with other companies/businesses will force you to compete in prices and the market will relegate itself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's nothing inaccurate about the guide. He explains how to compare the crafted (gem) price average to the ore cost on your server before buying anything. It doesn't matter what server you're on. <br />
<br />
Not buying mats that are more expensive than the crafted results is an important part of making money AND is mentioned in the guide.<br />
<br />
I find it hard to believe anyone's server is regularly prone to these very obvious gold-making strategies. The real work here is watching for the rare items that show up cheap enough to make money on. And similarly, being patient enough to avoid wasting deposits and driving down your own prices by flooding the market.<br />
<br />
None of this is easy money unless you get very lucky on your server. You're spending time on the AH instead of flying in circles around Icecrown/Sholazar gathering -- either way you're working for the money. With the AH route, you're also taking a risk every time you invest money in mats, because you may or may not be able to sell for a profit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It kinda sucks this was posted as I've been doing this for quite some time but I guess I'll live :D<br />
The Thorium ore market and its prospected gems have been expensive for quite some time. The reason is because it is absolutely needed to level jewelcrafting and there is a point in leveling it where you cannot get any further without these gems. You have to constantly watch the cost of Thorium ore on your server as it also gets rather expensive and there is a point where no more profit can be made. Just buy up all the 'cheap' ore. <br />
<br />
As for the prices of the gems - his posted prices are pretty different from what I've seen (on the two servers I've played on). Star rubys have -always- been the cheapest as they are also obtainable from prospecting mithril ore. Blue sapphires have also been rather low. Huge emeralds, large opals and azerothian diamonds can sell for ridiculous amounts. As always - the best way to make money is to watch it's moving price and profit when it gets to the right point (ie after somebody buys out half the AH).</div></div><hr />

this is a classic case of a glib remark.<br />
So you are saying some one should give up 450 jc and take Mining since boub wrote a guide that increases<br />
the price of that ore to a ton of gold.<br />
Yours and boub's assumption is based on an infinite amount of playtime and a dozen chars on each side of the game. This is not true for 80% or more of the population. Boub should understand that with this guide he is only helping those players who are already making money using AH traiding one way or other. This is a game for me and not a job and probably for lots of other ppl. I play the game for actual story line and not for the game economy. I don't want a job in the game that pays me 200g an hour. I only make money that I need to buy stuff for raiding. But if you tell me an enchant is going to cost me 1500G now that was costing 500g earlier becAuse of a guide than probably that guide is not worth for 80% of player base.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed, but as with most markets, there IS still elasticity. Most JCs probably have a miner that can mine thorium, and it's fairly easy to farm on an 80. I tried to watch the AH for cheap thorium for a while leveling my jewelcrafting, and finally gave up and farmed it. :P On the plus side, I ended up with a bunch extra to sell at ridiculously high prices :D Between extra ore and disenchanting BOEs, I think I *made* money leveling jewelcrafting. :o</div></div><hr />

Any smart auctioneero will use them to make profit, since you are creating a nicely predictable increase in demand and supply.<br />

Before the Glyph one came out, glyph prices were in the crapper and no Scribe was capable of making money because some dumb player thought selling glyphs at cost and hoping for tips later was a smart way to play. Now, every glyph has representation on the AH at all times of the day, which is not only convenient to the people wanting to buy usually obscure glyphs, but glyph prices in general were &quot;reset&quot; higher. I never bothered learning how to configure that 2nd AH addon, but I have made ~700g a day just by scanning the AH and undercutting the glyphs I see listed for 60g apiece.<br />

I can see why some people would be mad about the Thorium thing, because I'm sure they're like me and would go out of their way to NOT have to farm anything if they can help it. But if Thorium prices increase by 200%, then it may be worth it to dust off my miner, put on some techno, and go farm some.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Draenei totems are the current default Alliance totems, and Tauren totems are the current default Horde totems. Personally I prefer them to the new ones, but each to their own.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Arthzil</div><div class="date">2009-10-13, 12:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">because everyone on your server saw this guide<br />
<br />
Now that's some ego! Thanks for guides, now every item you mentioned in any guide is 2x more expensive because some wannabe wants to be super rich. Don't get me wrong, but this is really ruining that little economy there was left... take thorium for example, on many realms it's one of best sources for gold sellers (speed + underground hacks) and now for few days they will get 200% price for free.<br />
<br />
How about making guide about &quot;odd&quot; aspects of AH. Take for example lvl 5-60 greens for 50g a piece or famous Titanium Ore. Prices of epic gems are going down (on my realm they've settled at 150-200g for crafted) but ore prices are strong as ever (~80% of prospecting landing date). To earn something from it you really have to be lucky since for gems it's better to have alchemy toon (you can even choose gem! :P) and Titanium Powder is so random it's just way cheaper to get broken necklace.<br />
<br />
I got a bit away from topic, but my point is that getting something of AH is only possible if your &quot;way&quot; is known by limited amount of people that figured it out by themselves. Remember that saying about giving poor person fishing pole or fish? Well, if you give fishing pole &quot;to everyone on my realm&quot; then fishing pond will run out empty.<br />
<br />
PS: By all means, I'm even grateful for glyph guide, now I can buy stupid glyph for 4g not 50g and it's guys with Inscription problem that overpriced glyphs won't sell because thanks to guide glyph prices are going down and Glyph Mastery books are going way up. Not mine problem, cheers ;)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
oh, of course it's easy to sell them, there are always people who are leveling jc and they can't do it w/o these gems<br />
<br />
<br />
You realize that only JC need them to lvl? Engi has some patterns with them but while I lvld I just walked around on cheapest way. One major error too, JC can handle lvling without buying these gems of AH, they can just prospect themselves...<br />
<br />
Anyway, for me these guides are showing what should I dump because it's going to become worthless. Economy 101 - too many crafters (thx to guides) lead to too many crafts which will create flood in AH (sure, instead of you posting 20 items you post 3-5, but due to guide 50-100 ppl do same), that leads to dropping prices = no profit.<br />
<br />
Guides are not helping anyone because *some players* that are not familiar with AH mechanics will just loose gold thanks to guide. Good way to earn gold is always way you find out yourself.</div></div><hr />

I re-read my post a few times and I can't quite find the spot on there where age makes any difference in any of my points: <br />
<br />
-- Anyone can play the AH the same as they could any real life monetary market. <br />
-- All all you need to play any market, (real or digital) is time, education, dedication, and motivation. <br />
-- Anyone can be educated, and demanding that people stay stupid for your own goals is shockingly selfish and disgusting (as I commented in my previous post) this would be like the Fortune 500 companies demanding a halt to all collegiate courses on Business, Economics, and Banking so that people could remain ignorant for their own personal gain. <br />
-- In Real Life, exactly like in the game, anyone can start a business/play the market with the above things mentioned (time, dedication, education etc etc)<br />
-- Also just like real life, and exactly like in the game, the vast majority of people are too lazy, uneducated or not determined enough to see the process through, even if they try their hand in it. <br />
<br />
<br />
End result: everything returns they way it used to be. You will continue to make your gold on the AH and everyone will go back to buying it, just like all the top companies in the world will continue to do whatever they want and the rest of us will just go back to eating Cheetos and voting for American Idol. <br />
<br />
Calm down, your gold is fine. :-*</div></div><hr />

For glyphs, there's be a 24-hour bot that makes the real money. Everybody else will get in a single sale, here or there, and make very little unless they are that bot. Enchanting is a bit better, and some other professions are sometimes decent, but every good server has people that have kept the cash cows cornered for a long time. And you won't win versus a fully automated toon that is on all day long.</div></div><hr />
