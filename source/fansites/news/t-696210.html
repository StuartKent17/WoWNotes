Pandaren Monk Sales raises $1.1M for Make-A-Wish Foundation<br />
On Tuesday, Feb. 16, we were honored to host a special event at our Irvine, Calif. headquarters to mark the donation of more than $1.1 million to the Make-A-Wish Foundation and Make-A-Wish Foundation International, two organizations that grant the wishes of children with life-threatening medical conditions in 36 countries around the world. <br />
<br />
This donation, which was based on 50 percent of the total sales during November and December of the Pandaren Monk pet for World of Warcraft, was ultimately made possible by the World of Warcraft community. We appreciate the support the community showed for this important cause. <br />
<br />
As part of yesterday's event, we invited 15 wish children and their families to tour the Blizzard campus, meet with the World of Warcraft development team, and participate in a variety of fun activities. Check out the press release (http://us.blizzard.com/en-us/company/press/pressreleases.html?100217) to read more about the event, and visit the Make-A-Wish Foundation (http://www.wish.org/) and Make-A-Wish Foundation International (http://www.worldwish.org/) websites to learn more about these organizations. <br />

The Future of WoW TCG - Part 2<br />
Following Blizzard's announcement (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/future-of-wow-tcg-realms-lag-icc-progression/) a couple of days ago, Upper Deck International finally posted a few more details on how things will evolve for WoW TCG in the next couple of months. Apparently WoW TCG products will be available until the end of March, Spectral Tigers will become very hard to find after that I guess. <br />
Over the past few months there has been much speculation about the future of the World of Warcraft Trading Card Game and Miniatures Game and due to ongoing discussions, we haven’t been able to provide any clear answers until now.<br />
<br />
After long and careful deliberation, Upper Deck International (UDI) will not be renewing its World of Warcraft license agreements with Blizzard Entertainment. We’ve had a fantastic time working on the World of Warcraft brand and feel we have produced some of the most compelling TCG and Miniatures Game products since the turn of the century. Unfortunately, due to gradually declining sales over the past few years and the overall downturn in the economic climate, we have had to make the tough decision to discontinue our World of Warcraft product lines.<br />
<br />
UDI World of Warcraft products will be available until the end of March. Upcoming products such as the Class Starter Deck, Wrathgate Booster, Souls of Vengeance Starter, Deluxe Starter and Booster will not go into production.<br />
<br />
We know this is disappointing news for all World of Warcraft fans and want to thank players and retailers for their ongoing support over the years.<br />
Being part of such a great and passionate community has truly been a privilege.<br />
<br />
We are currently working with Blizzard Entertainment to facilitate a smooth transition as they work on their own plans for a World of Warcraft Trading Card Game.<br />
Further announcements on this transition will follow over the coming weeks.<br />
<br />
We will be pulling out all the stops to send off the UDI World of Warcraft lines in style. Look out for special events at your local gaming store with some of the greatest prize support ever and a final opportunity to complete your collection.<br />

Are we done with game balance changes until Cataclysm?<br />
We're not done until Cataclysm actually ships. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23269036809-are-we-done-with-balance-changes-until-cata.html))<br />
<br />
Housing<br />
While this originally came up before I was around, I think this has been answered at some BlizzCons since then. While we think this could be a fun idea, we also like the idea of seeing a lot of people in cities and don't want to make main cities feel like ghost towns - if you need an example of this head to Silvermoon (yeah, that's a cheap shot, I know). So for now this idea remains an interesting idea but we'd have to make sure it fits into the game well and meets our expectations which are pretty high for something like this. <br />
<br />
[...] It's generally a better idea to keep the world filled and alive than empty, yes. It's also hard to say that letting people run off to their own cabin to relax in peace will really be a big bonus to the game for the vast majority of the playerbase. We'll see how things go in the future though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23279927930-player-owned-houses--dev-status.html))<br />

The Phylactery of the Nameless Lich's proc is a little underbudget and we plan to correct that in an upcoming patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23269216964-phylactery-underbudget.html))<br />

Glyph of Disease bug - Icy Talons not active after a disease refresh<br />
The intent is that the Glyph of Disease counts as Frost Fever for the purposes of activating Icy Talons. The issue you describe is a technical limitation which prevents it from working this way. It's something we definitely want to fix, though I don't have a time frame to provide at the moment for when this fix will occur.

Glyph of Wrath Suggestions<br />
Glyph OF Wrath: Increases the cast time of Wrath by 0.5 and increases damage by X% <br />
I understand the intent and it's clever in a way, but we would be hesitant to introduce a glyph that would actually be a bad glyph for players who weren't capable of benefiting from a bunch of haste. There are some glyphs with a kiss / curse vibe, but usually not this severe, and with a curse that really isn't a curse when you consider that it lets you benefit more from haste in the long run.<br />
<br />
It might make more sense if you tucked it away where only endgame focused players could reach it (like an idol that dropped off an ICC boss), but even then it would almost need a warning label explaining what it was trying to do.

Destruction Spec<br />
We know that Destruction is a little low on damage at the moment and needs a bit of help which we hope to deliver before Cataclysm. As usual we can't make any guarantees on when or if this will happen for sure though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23269136780-any-word-on-destruction-adjustments.html))</div></div><hr />

Actually, it was $10 per Monk, which makes it $2,200,000 / 10 = 220,000 Pandaren Monks sold.</div></div><hr />

THIS IS A WITCHHUNT. &gt;:|<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How the hell would player housing kill city populations? Just don't put auction houses, banks, trade chat, class and profession trainers, quest givers, or vendors into housing, and people will keep going to the cities.<br />
<br />
<br />
The problem is player housing, usually in other MMOs, gives this kind of luxury. In the same sense those other MMOs don't have booming major cities like WoW does, usually leading to aforementioned ghost towns or said player housing replacing major cities hubs and reducing lag for everyone (like in CoH/CoV).<br />
<br />
In the future there may be a way to make everyone happy on this, but right now I believe the lot of us are focusing on other features.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Oh great, yeah, why only have 1 class/spec in the dumps when you can have 2, right? <br />
<br />
That &quot;glyph of wrath&quot; was a suggestion to moonkin scaling with stats because, right now, it's awful. <br />
They have a soft haste cap and a crit cap.<br />
The haste cap affects the solar eclipse portion of the rotation where wrath will clip the GCD. That number is only 400 haste rating. <br />
The crit cap affects the lunar eclipse portion of the rotation where starfire will ALWAYS crit and any extra crit rating is wasted. This number can vary but almost all endgame moonkin have reached this point.<br />
Once both caps are reached (common), crit and haste affect only half of your entire rotation each. Haste would only be useful for lunar and crit only useful for solar.<br />
Increasing the damage and cast time of wrath would make haste useful across the board. It would also become a ridiculously good stat to the point where moonkins would start stacking it over crit and possibly move up to the usefulness of spellpower.</div></div><hr />

When you're done with your business at auction houses, banks, trade chat, class and profession trainers, quest givers, and vendors... where do you go? Often, people just idle in their favorite spot in their favorite city when they've got nothing else to be doing. People with housing would probably choose their house over a city. Now, imagine what all those cities would look like if every person who'd been standing still for more than 60 seconds was gone. Pretty empty.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong. I would like to have a house to personalize, customize, and idle in, and I don't think a bunch of half-AFK players make a city look alive or interesting... but I get where they're coming from.</div></div><hr />

This. I am very disappointed about that tbh. They already did a lot of bull-ish over the last years just to make some more $$$ but then saying: &quot;give money to the poor&quot; or whatever and taking 50% of that money then is pretty much the worst thing they could do.<br />
<br />
If they really want to make a difference they should have just donated 1M without milking the achievementhunters even more. Its not like they could not afford 1M for that...</div></div><hr />

Most organizations that do what Blizzard has done give less than 50% of their sales to charity. Why aren't you complaining about the businesses that only donate 1% or 5% of the profit to charity?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm all up against player/guild housing - I don't think it's a good idea and it wouldn't fit to this particular game well in my opinion. But Blizzard, pleeeease, if you want seeing a lot of people in cities then do *something* with the cities. Main city of each expansion was almost unplayable at peak times (Ironforge in vanilla, Shattrath in TBC) and Dalaran in WOTLK is just extreme. Around 8pm it takes me 15-30 seconds to open the mail or to sell item to vendor. Instant spells take 10 seconds to cast etc. <br />
<br />
Picking up for example gems from mail and cutting them in Dalaran has been one of my worst nightmares during last year or so. When it's better and *MUCH* faster to teleport to tournament grounds, fly to the mailbox there, pick up the mail, do stuff with it, send it back and heartstone back to Dalaran than actually do it in Dalaran ... well, I think that says it all.<br />
<br />
So yeah, I'm all up for cities with a lot of people. But since this was and is continuing problem for about 5 years now I think you should do something about it, dear Blizzard. I understand that there are technical difficulties and the big crows are always laggy. But if it's problem on technical side do something in game to spread the load among all cities. <br />
<br />
Part of this solution already was (i'm sure it was important part of the decision on Blizzard side) leaving auction houses in vanilla zones. The other thing you could do imo is to just put teleports like they are in Dalaran/Shattrath to all cities. People are staying in Dalaran because everything they do in expansion is happening in Northrend. But if you had free, unlimited way to get from older cities back to Northrend immediately, I'm certain that people would spread a bit among other cities as well.<br />
<br />
Sorry for the wall of text but this was on my mind for ages now...</div></div><hr />

of course, because Blizzard making 15 kids dreams come true even though they didn't donate 100% profits, obviously makes what they did unimportant or not good, amIrite?<br />
<br />
I don't see how anyone can not think of what Blizz did as amazing.. They did something wonderful for Make-A-Wish, and 15 /children/ who probably won't be alive in a year, plus a handful of kids from the rest of the money.<br />

I don't see how 50% makes this null.</div></div><hr />

You are genuinely a Joyless and sad individual to make a complaint about this. Really. <br />
<br />
They could have put that pet up in the pet store and not given anything to any charity easily. People would have still bought it and most likely the same amount(since Pandarean are awesome). Fact is, the didn't, they gave half the profits to charity, and the money will be used to make some very sick kids happy.<br />
<br />
If your whole life revolves around finding the bad in every little story, then you really do have a very sad life, and I kind of feel sorry for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No its just 1.1 million.<br />
<br />
also using death ill kids to earn money is a f*** disgrace. If you wanna do something for charity you give out this pet for 10$ and donate the whole amount. Plus you dont time limit it.<br />
<br />
I just cant believe that people acutally believe blizzard is doing something good. 1.1million down their pockets for abusing terminal ill children, thats how good people look? People hate managers for getting a high bonus and love blizzard for earning money with stunts like that? you gotta be kidding me.<br />
<br />
But this also shows why Blizzard is going nuts about it. those pets dont take much work to be done as some animations and graphics are already ingame. SO little to no effort and 1.1million for just one pet? Aso the Lich is just a tiny modell of other lichs, so no work at all and not 50% to charity? Thats some really nice incoming.<br />
<br />
Blizzard also learned they can sell fridges to eskimos because the typical WoW customer (no they are certainly no players) will buy everything and doesnt even get it when he is taken advantage of.<br />
<br />
Also dont try to say that is has no affect on the game, everyone with a right mind knows that it has and it has also a effect on new content and developments.<br />

If i were Robert Kotick i would laugh all day at the people that bought it.</div></div><hr />

I don´t think anyone is saying 1.1 mill is not nice. The problem for my part is Blizzard pocketing 1.1 mill of their players and using sick kids to do it, while getting a bunch of free publicity..

sassy, hypocritical and you don't make any sense.<br />
<br />
If you really think it was that bad, then why didn't you take your 10$ and donate the whole amount to MaW instead of buying a pet &quot;they didn't put any effort in&quot;. The truth is most players wouldn't. Even if blizzard would have put in an option: either 10$ to buy that pet or 10$ to donate. We can imagine the sad answer...<br />
Blizzard was nice and combined it. It was a nice sidecause for buyers. People were more like interested in the pandaren pet otherwise they would have donated directly.<br />
<br />
And your argument that players donated money and not blizzard would be always be true. Where does blizzard money/income come from? Maybe from people who buy the game and pay monthly fees?<br />
<br />
it is clear they didn't only have donating MaW in mind. So what?<br />
Blizzard is a company and not a charity. Still they donated 50% of that sale.<br />
Tell me any company who does this at all? tell me any company who donates 100% of what they sell? Or anything that comes close to it?<br />
All the companies and hack, all the stars who donate also want puplicity.<br />
<br />
As side note: you guys have to calculate another way.<br />
It was not always 10$. In Europe it was 10€ which is like 13/14$ and is Uk it was most likely 10£. So you can say that Europeans donated even more. Are they much more generous now? ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
From a marketing point of view its clever. Nobody doubts that. <br />
<br />
You achieve three things:<br />
-many people think blizzard is a nice company, terminal ill children are always a good draw <br />
- pet shop, itemshop version 1, gets reputation, introduced BECAUSE OF CHARITY<br />
- 1,1million$<br />
<br />
(maybe you can even lower your taxes because you donated to charity)<br />

it doesn't make sense...<br />
in our society there are no purely good companies...<br />
they need to survive. It might not always seem fair to you, but some people just worked hard to get that money and with free will and all isn't it up to then what they do with it?<br />
You can't force people to be good.<br />
Companies offer stuff like that because they know !most! People like to buy even more when they do something good by doing so.<br />
<br />
In Germany companies who sell beer or cleaning stuff or baby stuff sometimes do that.<br />
It's kind to put it on products you have to buy anyways. So why not buy by also doing something good.<br />

Actually I bought the pet for my nephew. I would never spend money on a useless vanity pet, even for him, but since it was for charity I was fine with it. It would have suited Blizzard once they saw it actually made millions to up the percentage from 50.<br />
I also live in a country that pays the highest amount of money pr citizen to 3rd world countries due to our high income tax, so I help plenty thank you very much. <br />
You keep saying the Pandaran was the main cause for people buying, I say without the charity scam it would not have sold as much.<br />

That is really besides the point and has no bearing on this discussion. My issue was with Blizzard making 1.1mill while not donating a dime themselves and then milking the press for all it´s worth. I find that greedy, petty, low and despicable. Had they covered their own expenses and donated the rest that would have been fine, and maybe also give the players more credit rather than having them as a footnote.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
clearly you need a lesson in marketing.<br />
&quot;the perfect custumor&quot; in an economy system would be the &quot;homo oeconomicus&quot; model (that's Latin for those who don't know). His characteristics are (as costumer):<br />
-maximazing his benefits<br />
-unlimited needs<br />
-always makes the right decision<br />
-uses his available ways/capital/ devices the best possible way<br />
-no defined attributes like male/female, tall/small etc<br />
-posseses all the dealing information<br />
-knows excatly what he wants and what not<br />
-and he's strict rational<br />
<br />
--&gt; that means he would have even bought it if there was NO donations. Cause stuff like that won't fill his needs.<br />
*it's a model. And I hope you all know that someone like this can't exist <br />
<br />
The model you mean would be the &quot;homo reziprocans&quot;: he's the opposite and puts weight on &quot;fairness&quot;/ donating and stuff like that. (sure they might be a better model for that but those are the two basics.)<br />
So people who bought it because they wanted both, the pet and to do something good are actually not &quot;the perfect costumer&quot;.<br />
<br />
P.s. I learned this stuff years ago and in German ;) So I hope I got it right for and you get what I said.</div></div><hr />

Actually I bought the pet for my nephew. I would never spend money on a useless vanity pet, even for him, but since it was for charity I was fine with it. It would have suited Blizzard once they saw it actually made millions to up the percentage from 50.<br />
Like I said, very hypocritical. You say it's wrong what they are doing and you totally disagree (I think you said &quot;it's the wrong way&quot; to do stuff like that), but still, you supported it cause it was for charity. Yeah I call it support cause you did by buying this pet. It doesn't matter for whom. It was clearly your choice, as you stated it.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I also live in a country that pays the highest amount of money pr citizen to 3rd world countries due to our high income tax, so I help plenty thank you very much. <br />
That is besides the point. Now you are doing the same thing as blizzard.<br />
Why did you mention it? To stay in a good light and assure/show you did something good.<br />
That's exactly the same thing blizz did, just with much more viewers.<br />
<br />
<br />
You keep saying the Pandaran was the main cause for people buying, I say without the charity scam it would not have sold as much.<br />
You probably right about that.<br />
But let's do the math. Let's say they sold 200.000 for 5$ (since they donated half).<br />
Meaning without charity they would have only need to sell 100.000 for 10$ (for the same income).<br />
With all the wow players out there who want to have and achieve everything and be the best, I think this could be very well be a number they could have reached without their &quot;charity scam&quot; or at least come close to it.<br />
And do you think Blizzard would have cared about those few thousands they might not have sold?<br />
This store is probably only 0,001% of their income. (maybe a little more, more likely less)<br />
<br />
<br />
Big difference between taking money from your own profits and donating to charity and setting up a collection that makes your company just as much as the charity they &quot;support&quot;. I&amp;#180;m sorry you can&amp;#180;t see that..<br />
I can see that and I get your point, but clearly you can't get/see our point. This was totally optional. Maybe they might have not make as much money without, but they just wanted another income source (by backing it up with charity &quot;doing something good while marketing&quot; that's what a company does) , so if it would have failed they would have done something else. They are going to release the 3rd WoW addon and Starcraft this year and Diablo next year. The store nor the &quot;charity scam&quot; wouldn't make much of a difference in income.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That is really besides the point and has no bearing on this discussion. My issue was with Blizzard making 1.1mill while not donating a dime themselves and then milking the press for all it&amp;#180;s worth. I find that greedy, petty, low and despicable. <br />
That is exactly the point. It doesn't matter for which intention they did it, but they did it. (and don't think the people at blizzard are that heartless that they though only of money income and publicity, but like I said it's a company). All the income was now their money, so actually they spend their own money on charity. <br />
Simple example/explanation: If you buy a radio from me for 25$ and I donate all, you can't say you donated everything and I didn't spend a dime... can you?<br />
Sorry for saying that but: sense?<br />
<br />
<br />
Had they covered their own expenses and donated the rest that would have been fine, and maybe also give the players more credit rather than having them as a footnote.<br />
That's what a charity organization would have done/does, not a company. You always miss that Blizzard is a company, not a charity organization.<br />
Which brings me exactly back to point: Tell me one COMPANY who would have done the same? Tell me one COMPANY who wouldn't have done it for marketing reasons, to stay in a better light, for publicity WHILE doing something good?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ceridith</div><div class="date">2010-02-18, 03:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Am I really reading people pissed that for a limited time Blizzard was giving half of their profits to charity and yet they complained?<br />
<br />
<br />
Yes, you are, because Blizzard hid behind the guise of their 'good intentions' to market their virtual pet store, which is a sleazy thing to do. If they truly wanted to be charitable they would have donated 100% to MaW, because it costs them pennies to sell one of those virtual pets.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you had an issue with it, why didn't you send 10$ to the charity and not buy the virtual useless pet?<br />
<br />
Blame yourself, not the company who actually managed to raid 500k for charity.<br />
<br />
<br />
Um, what? The people upset by it very likely did not buy the pet for the very reason that they are upset by it, and have/would directly donated to charities. I know I have.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
If they hadn't done that, they would have selled probably half of them and make the same amount of money anyways...<br />
<br />
<br />
Really now? Well let's see the numbers of sales for the mini lich pet to compared to pandaren, because they would likely be similar if there were no 'special cause' tacked onto the pandaren. I have only seen one person with the lich, and dozens with the pandaren. If those numbers are halfway accurate, then it suggests that the pandaren sold multiple times more, which means that the market scheme of &quot;for a good cause&quot; caused them to generate a lot more profit than if they had just sold them normally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So what have you done for charity lately?<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok lets reflect this thing to a single person:<br />
There is someone who is already stinkrich that says: &quot;give me 2.000.000$ and I will donate half of it because it costs approx. 1.000.000&amp; to transfer it!&quot;. Do you really think he is a great person for doing that? No.<br />
As he is already stinkrich he should just donate something from his money and do not ask people that only own about 0,1% of the money that he owns.</div></div><hr />

Um, what? The people upset by it very likely did not buy the pet for the very reason that they are upset by it, and have/would directly donated to charities. I know I have. I doubt all who are complaining did donate anything. They just try to be better people by showing off. (I believe you you did, but I doubt most did).<br />
<br />

Wrong. You have to include that Pandaren are much more popular. How many people always wanted them to be a playable race? Their was much more feedback about the pandaren being cool and having cool animations than with the lich pet.<br />
You could even imagine: that even if they put charity on lich pet and not on pandaren, probably more pandaren would have been sold, cause more people were interested in pandaren than in this lich pet. ofc this is not open to discuss and only a guess, but I makes sense to me.</div></div><hr />

Supporting a cause and then having an opinion how they have later handled themselves is not hypocritical. It´s called having an opinion. Making 1.1 mill profits is petty and greedy<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
They care enough to keep 1.1 mill bucks from kids. Like I stated earlier, when Blizzard learned how well the pet was selling, they could have gone higher than 50%<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That is exactly the point. It doesn't matter for which intention they did it, but they did it. (and don't think the people at blizzard are that heartless that they though only of money income and publicity, but like I said it's a company).

<br />
So it would be OK for paypal to keep 50% of donations to Haiti? This &quot;it´s a company&quot; excuse is complete BS and doesn´t excuse douchebaggery.. They took a 50% administration fee for transferring peoples money to a charity and then milked the shit out of it presswise<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
That's what a charity organization would have done/does, not a company. You always miss that Blizzard is a company, not a charity organization.<br />

<br />
<br />
We are not talking about what other companies do or might do, we are talking about what Blizzard has done. This &quot;because the others do it makes it ok for me &quot; excuse i worthless to me. And has caused quite a bit of trouble historically speaking, when someone is enough of a demagog to get a whole population into that mentality</div></div><hr />

No one would give a single person &quot;2.000.000$&quot; for nothing. (for sake it's a COMPANY)<br />
What if they really worked hard to get their than it's their right (with free will and such) to decide on their own.<br />
So after your opinion only rich people should donate, cause they own so much more than we &quot;normals&quot; do?<br />

There are several companies who donate large sums of money directly to charitable organizations, directly out of their profit. Claiming that they don't have some alternative motivation to do so isn't the point. Even when an individual donates money, they are ultimately doing it for a selfish reason if you analyze it -- to make themselves feel better by doing something considered good. But again, that's not the point.<br />
<br />
What I have a problem with, is Blizzard using it as a ploy to directly make profit by taking half of the price and pocketing it themselves. This is completely different from a company deciding to donate out of it's profits after the fact, because Blizzard actually turned a rather significant profit with their little ploy of using charity to get people to open their wallets, and then keeping half of what they took... which I'm sure the profit they made off this is nothing more than petty cash to Kottick.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard were to suddenly decide, &quot;oh hey, we're going to donate one million dollars to Make a Wish foundation&quot;, directly out of their profit, no strings attached, then that would be perfectly fine. And yes, there are many companies that donate in this manner. The company I work for does this when it performs well, which it did last year.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kiiltesh</div><div class="date">2010-02-18, 03:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Reading the statement regarding WoW-tcg like that was a massive dissapointment. Not because the contents are disspointing, but because they cannot be considered news.<br />
<br />
Consider for example this bit: <br />
After long and careful deliberation, Upper Deck International (UDI) will not be renewing its World of Warcraft license agreements with Blizzard Entertainment.<br />
<br />
This is in direct contradiction with the info Blizzard released on the matter earlier in the week.<br />
<br />
This isn't a UDE trying to tell us what's going on, it's UDE trying to hurt a future competitor. The post they made contains both lies and exaggerations, and trying to find out which parts are true is a matter of pure guesswork.<br />
<br />
<br />
For anyone interested in the future of the game, I suggest you head over to the official tcg forums on this address:<br />
http://entertainment.upperdeck.com/wow/community/forums/94/ShowForum.aspx<br />
Not only did they pick up on this several days ago, it's also being activaly discussed by people who clearly know more about the issue than Boubouille does.</div></div><hr />

Many of you are missing the important issue here. Blizzard has donated a very large sum of money, more then myself and most likley anyone on this website will ever do. Be thankful for that. Its an amazing blessing to both the charity and the people the charity is focused on.<br />
<br />
Also people need to realize that these simple Pandas and Monks are not simple graphics that took 15 minutes to design and throw on a server. This is people jobs and salary. Blizzard had to advertise, develop, and maintain each and every aspect of this entire ordeal.<br />

I did not ask what you have done lately (show me that passage where I asked you). And even if: everybody pays taxes. That's not something to be mention worthy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Purely speculation<br />
Yeah like that 11,5 Million players that keep playing, although it gets boring and there's nothing to do.<br />
It's a speculation, but nut purely.<br />
<br />
<br />

purely speculation, cause that would never happen. paypal is an alternative paying method and not anything else. A bank also keeps a small percentage for offering that service. So that's totally off the point.<br />
Yes Blizzard is a company. A company is there to make products, sell them and make money out of it.<br />
And people would stop buying it if they wouldn't need it, but a company goes for money. That is life basics.<br />
Look at apple. To produce the new iPad (estimates say they) cost 300$. They want twice for it. Why?^^ thats mean. they could donate half of it.<br />
<br />
<br />

This is not the point.<br />
You are always criticizing what they are doing.The truth is they spend a good 1,1Mill to a good cause. (better than nothing, no matter how they got there)<br />
<br />
You should be criticizing other companies that although &quot;that they have so much money&quot; they don't spend any or don't do anything. <br />
<br />
&quot;That's what a charity organization would have done/does, not a company. You always miss that Blizzard is a company, not a charity organization.<br />
Which brings me exactly back to point: Tell me one COMPANY who would have done the same? Tell me one COMPANY who wouldn't have done it for marketing reasons, to stay in a better light, for publicity WHILE doing something good?&quot;<br />
Because you simple CANT answer that question, because there aren't other companies.<br />
At least they did something good for the world. (for that it doesn't matter to me for which reason / yes i get what you're saying, but for me it's more important that at least they do something).<br />
Instead I am very happy for those kids, that more wishes come true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If the companies really wanted truly something good, they would spend anonymously and that's it.<br />
It doesn't matter if they announce it in advance or do it afterwards.<br />
Fact is they do it for publicity and to present them as a better company.<br />
<br />
Let's say Apple spends afterwards from their profit money.<br />
Customers would think: Let's try to buy stuff from apple. maybe it is as good as others. Plus they spend something before, they might do it again. and that thinking results in profit too.<br />
<br />
So all companies are evil wicked and try to get bigger, sell more and get more money. Screw them all... ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
We're not missing the point, it seems that you are.<br />
<br />
Blizzard only passed on 50% of a donation given by a number of it's customers, and pocketed the other half. The cost to create the non-combat pet, even if it did take a designer a full 40 hour week to create (extremely unlikely it would take that long), it would still not justify $1.1 million dollars being pocketed by Blizzard. The cost to replicate and sell an additional pandaren monk would have been pennies, so they would likely have been making well over $4.50 on each sale... which again, does not justify them pocketing $1.1 million dollars.<br />
<br />
The main problem here is that Blizzard directly made profit off of this, and is now trying to pass it off as charitable.<br />
<br />
Is it nice that they gave some money to a charity? Yes... but at the same time it's sleazy that they made profit off of the fact that they pocketed half of the rest of the money. Blizzard likely could have donated 90% of the cost to charity and still made a profit, albeit a lot smaller of one... that is what we're bothered by, is the amount they kept for themselves.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Where do I say that the rich have to be paid?<br />
You can spend to a real charity organizations (they only keep a very small percent to cover their cost).<br />
That's why people found them. To help others.<br />
Don't do it with a company who does it more likely for profit and a good repu.<br />
That's why people found companies to make money.<br />
<br />
I think even we have so better life standards than others. So yeah if we have money and want something good, not something ego like a newer, better flat screen, than yeah donate it.</div></div><hr />

I think most of us get the point. You just don't get the whole point. You are only looking from one side on it.<br />
You guys just need to complain and destroy everything good that is left in this world by criticizing it. It doesn't matter why they did something. At least they did something. Spending 1,1Mill is maybe not much in comparison what they've earned (totally) but it's something and helps other people.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard only passed on 50% of a donation given by a number of it's customers, and pocketed the other half. Easy explaining:<br />
Blizzard offered pets.<br />
People bought them for 10$.<br />
Blizzard gets 10$ (it's now their money!)<br />
At the end donate half of their money, not yours. It's not you donating, it's them.<br />
You couldn't decide on it. Okay you did it because you knew it, so indirectly you did something good.<br />
but it was not your money anymore, cause you paid for your good and that's how it goes.<br />

<br />
The main problem here is that Blizzard directly made profit off of this, and is now trying to pass it off as charitable. Simple again:<br />
People found companies to make profit/money.<br />
People found charities to help other (with only covering the costs)<br />
<br />
<br />
Is it nice that they gave some money to a charity? Yes... but at the same time it's sleazy that they made profit off of the fact that they pocketed half of the rest of the money. Blizzard likely could have donated 90% of the cost to charity and still made a profit, albeit a lot smaller of one... that is what we're bothered by, is the amount they kept for themselves.<br />
Read above...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Of course i like the idea, but the thing that kept me from buying it was that it is so lame that a billion dollar company still want a piece of the cake from a charity event...<br />
<br />
Shame on you blizzard !<br />
<br />
<br />
And to some of the other comments about blizzard being &quot;a company&quot;, SO WHAT ?<br />
<br />
They do a charity event, post it bigtime on the websites they control, they post it ingame, then give 50% of the money, company or not, i dont care, dont call it charity if it isent true charity, then call it a donation or some other spinned out shit instead...</div></div><hr />

Wow, really? Think on that and you might see the selfish greed behind that statement.<br />
<br />
Here is the question each of you should be asking. If Blizzard simply asked that each of you donate 10$ to X charity and in return you would get nothing, what would you do?<br />
<br />
I find it odd that people are frustrated with what Blizzard did with the money they earned, yet I guarantee none of the people complaining simply donated without something in return.<br />
<br />
Blizzard did a great thing and will be blessed.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard offered pets.<br />
People bought them for 10$.<br />
Blizzard gets 10$ (it's now their money!)<br />
At the end donate half of their money, not yours. It's not you donating, it's them.<br />
You couldn't decide on it. Okay you did it because you knew it, so indirectly you did something good.<br />
but it was not your money anymore, cause you paid for your good and that's how it goes.<br />
<br />
You're missing the main critical detail that makes what they did sleazy.<br />
<br />
They used the &quot;donation&quot; aspect of it to market it. In other words, people who otherwise would not have bought one, did, because they explicitly marketed the purchase of said item as having part of it going to charity.<br />
<br />
If they had not said anything about donating any of the proceeds originally, and then suddenly said &quot;by the way, we're going to donate a portion of this to charity&quot; and did so, then it would be completely different.<br />
<br />
As it stands however, it was used as a marketing ploy before the fact, to boost sales of the pandaren monk pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
These charities need money, that's all there is to it. They use the money to do good, if blizzard gave 10% or 5% or even 1% it would have helped them. This charity is gonna be able to do great work with the money they receive from blizzard and nobody, not the kids receiving their wishes or the charities handeling the money are going to be crying half as much as you people.<br />
<br />
There is nothing evil about this and you have to make a pretty far stretch to make it sound like that. Anyone bothering to make such a long stretch clearly has some kind of deep hatred for blizzard allready.<br />
<br />
Well go donate some money yourself, but ofcourse you won't because you probably have some lame ass excuse why that's a bad idea aswell. People sure can bitch about everything. Had blizzard just given the 100% profits people would complain how they just did it for the publicity. Sad little people that can only complain and are to much of a failure to ever do anything about it, please just keep your revolting thought process inside your twisted little heads and in your parents basement.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No I am not. You guys are twisting around the facts.<br />
You are saying it yourself. Most people would not have the idea just to donate directly nor to buy this pet.<br />
Now they indirectly donated instead of doing nothing plus got a pet*. (and blizzard, a company, maximized it's profit) <br />
<br />
*Idc what you say, but I believe the pet was the motivation to buy. The donation was just a sideeffect to feel better about it. I mean people could have donated directly anytime. <br />
So to say that the donation was the motivation is wrong, cause you don't need the pet to donate yourself (and helping more that way). It was only a plus to buy the pet you WANT.<br />
<br />
&quot;If the companies really wanted truly something good, they would spend anonymously and that's it.<br />
It doesn't matter if they announce it in advance or do it afterwards.<br />
Fact is they do it for publicity and to present them as a better company.<br />
<br />
Let's say Apple spends afterwards from their profit money.<br />
Customers would think: Let's try to buy stuff from apple. maybe it is as good as others. Plus they spend something before, they might do it again. and that thinking results in profit too.<br />
<br />
So all companies are evil wicked and try to get bigger, sell more and get more money. Screw them all... Wink&quot;<br />
<br />
All companies just donate to get more customer and higher sales rate. It doesn't matter if they say it in advance or do it afterwards.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let's say they wouldn't have done it (and thought okay after 2 month of hiding this fact we donate 50%):<br />
As of now ~200.000 got sold for 10$ (while donating 5$ afterwards for a good cause)<br />
Without maybe only 100.000 got sold maybe even less.<br />
<br />
Overall this would have meant less money for MaW (if we go after what you said)<br />
Yeah they used it to promote... so what?<br />
<br />
People got a pet they wanted and indirectly donated 5$.<br />
and a lot of sick kids can be happy about their wish come true.<br />
Isn't that what's it all about?<br />
About MaW being able to help more kids?...<br />
<br />
And you guys complain about stuff that is everywhere around you and is -more or less- normal.<br />
So why can't you just accept and see that Blizzard stood out of it (through whatever reason!) and made it possible to spend 1,1 Mill, some people would have never done other ways.<br />
Be happy about that. Cause this is what's important about all this.<br />
<br />
If this is not enough for you, that's your view. (and still you always miss the fact Blizz is a company to make profit/money, not a charity to help other, no matter what they called it). At least it's something! 1,1 Mill is more than we can ever imagine getting ourselves. I'm just soo sorry you can't see that.<br />
<br />
It's something to be happy for and NOT to complain about...</div></div><hr />

Are you retarded?<br />
<br />
You do realize that the main reason that business exist is to do business, right?<br />
<br />
Of -course- they're using it as a marketing ploy; businesses are not inherently altruistic institutions. They exist to make money; the services they provide are provided in order to make money.<br />
<br />
If they were not making money, they would not be in business; They would not be able to either afford the massive upkeep that running a business requires, not to mention one which deals in a constant and huge online presences, nor would they be able to convince people that investing with them was a valuable endeavour.<br />
<br />
And they made no secret that half the proceeds were going to charity; If you wanted your entire $10 to go to charity, you were more than free to directly donate to said charities. Other people decided they were happy with donating $5 to charity and paying Blizzard $5 in order to get a Pandaren non-combat pet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not just that Blizzard made profit. They're a company, I and others have no misconception of their purpose and intent.<br />
<br />
It's not just what Blizzard did or didn't donate. They are in it to make profit and don't have to donate anything, because they are a corporation which exists only to make profit.<br />
<br />
The problem however, is that Blizzard made a profit in part because it was a marketing ploy aimed at taking advantage of people's good will for them to profit more. Even this would be halfway tolerable as it's practically expected these days. What pushes it over the top is that now Blizzard is trying to pass it off like they did a huge service even after they walked away with such a big profit on their end from the whole promotion. That is what makes them sleazy. If they truly meant to appear charitable, they would have given a much larger portion of the money generated to charity, because walking away with $1 million in profit from $2.2 million in sales for something meant for charity seems pretty greedy to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 million in profit? Your thinking skills need more work.<br />
<br />
First off; they had to pay the designers who came up with the idea.<br />
Then; they had to pay the modelers who created the models.<br />
The artists who created the skins.<br />
The coders who scripted the animations.<br />
The coders who created the Blizzard store.<br />
The upkeep on servers used by the store.<br />
The bandwidth used by people accessing the store.<br />
The support staff who now have to keep that running along side the rest of their web presence.<br />
<br />
There are expenses associated with every single step of the process of doing anything in the corporate world.<br />
<br />
And if you think 100% of all donations go straight to the people being serviced by the charities; you're delusional.<br />
<br />
The charities themselves have a huge amount of overhead, simply by the pure fact that they're organizations of people who need to be compensated for their time and effort, and wear-and-tear of equipment and services.<br />
<br />
Quick check of the Make-A-Wish webpage shows roughly 76% of the money they take in going towards their charitable activities; are they now 'sleazy' because they don't put 100% into it? Because if they did; they would be out of business within weeks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You always start at the same point (with the same arguments) without seeing the whole. If that isn't really sleazy*?... Now I will explain this for the last time slowly to you (with your own text).<br />
*I feel like you guys always talk, but don't take time to read what others say.<br />
<br />
(*1*)Nobody was forced to buy this pet. The reason people bought this was for the pet, not to donate. This was just one more reason to do so / a nice side effect. If people really wanted to show their good will they could have donated directly. Blizzard didn't force anybody, so they didn't misuse anything more than others.<br />
Overall: Companies donate (sometimes announced in their sale / sometimes afterward from their profit) and even stars do the same thing.<br />
Why? New costumers, better reputation, to get you to watch their movies while they can do something good and nice. If people hear this: &quot;Boah, this company is so nice and donates so often, lets try their product and do something good while doing so.&quot;<br />
--&gt; Every company misuses people's goodwill in a sense. So this is totally the wrong place to start with...<br />
<br />
(*2*) First of all the definition of charity.:<br />
&quot;Voluntary activity of or disposition towards donating money, property, or services to the needy or for general social betterment.&quot; I think Blizzard definitely did this by giving 50% (1,1Mill!).<br />
<br />
Now the definition of company: <br />
&quot;An institution created to conduct business.&quot; Companies are mostly interested in maximizing their profit.<br />
Blizzard is a company. Only a charity organization would have given all, only covering the costs.<br />
<br />
Now the definition of charity organization:<br />
&quot;A charitable organization (also known as a charity) is an organization with charitable purposes only. Charities are all non-profit organizations, however, not all non-profit organizations are charities.&quot;<br />
<br />
--&gt; No company would have done it differently. That's what they do. At least Blizzard did something!<br />
<br />
The rest can be simply answered with the stuff I said above.<br />
<br />
(*3*) You're right with this, but this is not the intention of a company.<br />
So you think, giving &quot;only&quot; half of your income would be greedy?<br />
That's much more than other companies/people would do!<br />
<br />
If you want to see it or not. They did something charitable by donating half of it.</div></div><hr />

You're severely overestimating the overhead for the virtual pets. The individual pets themselves likely took no longer than 200 manhours to produce from conception of idea to completion, considering all involved, and that is likely a gross overestimate. The development of the virtual petstore I would not consider overhead for this specific virtual product as it was not made exclusively for it. So 200 man hours, even at $100 an hour (again, a gross overestimate), is $20,000. So it cost Blizzard $20,000 to create that one non-combat pet.<br />
<br />
The upkeep of the servers and bandwidth as well are also negligible. The cost to host a moderately popular online store (say the blizzard pet store) is far less than $1000 a month. Even if you throw in the maintenance cost of hiring people to look after said store, I would highly doubt it would even take more than a couple of employees' full work effort to maintain such a store. And again, this store is not exclusively for the pandaren pet, so the overhead costs are divvied. So, let's assume a $100,000 yearly overhead cost (which again, gross overestimate).<br />
<br />
So even if you used the ridiculous overestimate of $120,000 in overhead to create and sell the pet, that's still almost a million dollars in profit. Even if you went as far as to say that it cost half a million dollars to create this one virtual pet, and offset the cost of the hosting fees and development fees of the site, that's still half a million in profit, which again, is still a large profit for an arguably useless virtual pet.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And if you think 100% of all donations go straight to the people being serviced by the charities; you're delusional.<br />

<br />
<br />
I never said they didn't have overhead. Those overhead costs are required to operate, the rest goes to charity. Most of Blizzard's profit on the other hand is either grabbed up by Vivendi, or given out to the big fat multi-million dollar bonuses given out to Acti-Blizzard's execs.. Of the 50% Blizzard kept, likely far less than 20% of that went to expenses. Not bad you don't care about who you're taking money from.</div></div><hr />

You still miss the point of charity dude, when ppl do charity they donate their work and manhours to, in this case, children who needs a hand, so when they advertise it as charity, it should mean that they do it from free will and want to donate all money earned from this specific product to the charity in case.<br />
<br />
Its not like the ppl who call them greedy want them to donate all the money they earn, they just make so much money from other things, so still sitting on half the money from some sold pixels is just greedy, no mather how you look at it...</div></div><hr />

I would love to live in your world, I really would. <br />
<br />
Face facts. It's a capitalist world. Nothing is free no matter what way is cut. No doubt if they did give the profits(all of them) to charity then you would call them on the fact that they are getting free publicity. So they would have to do it completely anon. <br />
<br />
What then, Corperations and business no longer run promotions, offer services, or do anything for the good of a charity. Charities go bust, no good causes get done.<br />
<br />
Of course they did it with the intention of profit and publicity. It's the nature of the world that we live in. At the same time they did a great service to a very deserving charity. I really couldn't care less if they pocketed 1.1m for themselves because there are far worse company's doing much worse in the name of charity.</div></div><hr />
