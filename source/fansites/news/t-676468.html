In ages past the great Dragon Aspects worked alongside the night elves to forge powerful prismatic blades that could be used to thwart any evil that came into the world. They would become known as the blades of Quel'Serrar. One of these blades, which had become lost in time, was recently unearthed again by brave heroes of Azeroth. Now rediscovered, Quel'Serrar is revered once more as a mighty tool of raw power.<br />
<br />
Its sister blade, however, has not been seen for many years...<br />
<br />
The sword known as Quel'Delar was held by the group of kaldorei who would eventully become the high elves, and it was handed down from generation to generation. Most recently Quel'Delar was wielded by the valiant high elven warrior Thalorien Dawnseeker. Thalorien fought tirelessly in the Troll Wars to defend his beloved home of Silvermoon, the Sunwell, and all of Quel'Thalas. When the Scourge swept through the lands during the Third War, Thalorien was among the last lines of defense for the Sunwell. Despite the sword's power, he was ultimately slain by the overwhelming might of Arthas and his legendary runeblade, Frostmourne. Quel'Delar was thought to be lost forever.<br />
<br />
Following the destruction of their homeland, the determined blood elves began to regroup and rebuild. It was during this time that the battle-hardened warrior Lana'thel stumbled upon Quel'Delar, and soon afterward the greatest opportunity to use the blade presented itself: Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider raised an army and combined forces with Illidan Stormrage, who led them north to Icecrown on a mission to destroy the Lich King. Lana'thel readily followed her prince with one thought in mind -- revenge against the Scourge -- but only tragedy awaited her.<br />
<br />
In the icy hills of Northrend, Arthas ultimately defeated Illidan and Kael'thas, and the expedition's few survivors were scattered across the frozen wastes. One by one the Lich King sought out those who had challenged him, and Lana'thel found herself cornered. Using Quel'Delar, she struck at him with all her might... but Frostmourne's evil powers overwhelmed her. Through his blade, the Lich King chose Lana'thel to serve him in undeath as queen of the San'layn, a group responsible for overseeing the Scourge's operations across Azeroth.<br />
<br />
Queen Lana'thel eagerly carried out her new duties, but every time she looked at her blade, maddening anger would swell within her as she remembered her former life. She could not afford such distractions, and with a scream that echoed throughout Icecrown, she shattered Quel'Delar and flung the fractured pieces as far as she could.<br />
<br />
Now...<br />
<br />
The champions of the Alliance and the Horde who confront the Lich King's armies have but a slim chance of finding the pieces of this fabled blade. If they succeed, the heroes can embark on an epic adventure to re-forge Quel'Delar. They will require the strongest materials and a source of great power to make this shattered blade into the fearsome weapon it once was. Several classes can use Quel'Delar, and the sword can fit several different play styles. For any class that is unable to wield it, however, the Sunreaver blood elves and the Silver Covenant high elves will gladly take this relic of their history in exchange for a usable weapon.<br />
<br />
The search begins soon...</div></div><hr />

<br />
A caster axe or fist would be awsome too (shaman specific)! But yes, I agree, casting daggers are lame looking, much rather use a mace. Don't get me wrong I love the stats I get from my Relentless Spell Blade, but the mace looks soo much cooler. :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I doubt we're going to let her live. Sylvanas broke free of the Scourge's grasp, Lana'thel is very high ranked(sounds like it's one of the greatest title for the Scourge?), and to me it sounded like she was quite enjoying the power, as much as one can being corrupted like she is.<br />
<br />
No longer having the sword to remind her of her past, I think she'll just kill us when we meet her. That is unless the sword will play a part in the encounter, which I doubt it will</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Thalorien Dawnseeker was a high elf who gained notority for wielding the blade Quel'Delar. With the sword, he was part of the defense unit that guarded the Sunwell against the Scourge invasion of Quel'thalas. He fell in battle. His remains were buried on the southern tip of the Dead Scar on the Isle of Quel'Danas.<br />
<br />
<br />
The Quel'Delar is a 1h tanking sword that will be used by warriors, DKs and pallies (sorry droods).<br />
<br />
It will NOT be legendary and as such it will be more readily available for every class to get. Thus,<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
For any class that is unable to wield it, however, the Sunreaver blood elves and the Silver Covenant high elves will gladly take this relic of their history in exchange for a usable weapon.<br />
<br />
<br />
The quest chain for this is on wowwiki, look it up. It doesn't take the player to the Icecrown raid, however it does take him/her through the Icecrown 5-man dungeons. As such, I don't predict the ilvl of this item being over 256.</div></div><hr />

<br />
go back in time and get yourself a ragnaros 2hand, when you still can<br />
or go and farm val'anyr<br />
your lucky ones, that can even use 2 of the 6 legendarys ingame. dont be concerned about an epic item<br />
<br />
they both are legendary and much more important than a 5man epic X<br />
<br />
<br />
this one will come sooner than you think and it will be left behind you sooner as you think<br />
<br />
this new epic X may has an itemlevel of 264, but thats it.<br />
so its on same height with craftable pants that can be obtained through crafting for 5man players too</div></div><hr />

We shamans never get legendaries. unless we are healers of coarse. Wtb Dual enhancement legendary</div></div><hr />

Or in other words, will the fragments that drop only be lootable by one person at a time?<br />
Check the questline.<br />
<br />
It's more along the lines of a regular (dungeon)quest, not like the old legendaries.<br />
Only the starter is a drop, the rest are regular quest items(like 5 infused saronite, which is found all over the pit of saron)<br />
The chain seems to be pretty long, so i'd say the end reward should be around 232,which would be the same as ICC 5man on heroic, and only limited weapon drops, if any, in the new heroics.<br />
<br />
Also, since most people seem to ignore this:<br />
This is a dungeon quest, not a raid quest</div></div><hr />

It will likely be on par to IC-10, normal. It comes from the 5 mans, not from the raid.<br />

Hey Blizz, nice ideas but when less than .01% ever see some of the stuff you put out it doesn't do much for all the others that never see this type of stuff. I have first hand experience with my former guild concerning the Mace from Ulduar. It started more arguements than I care to ever experience again.</div></div><hr />

As been stated MANY times, Quel'Delar quest line is from the FIVE MAN dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
The champions of the Alliance and the Horde who confront the Lich King's armies have but a slim chance of finding the pieces of this fabled blade. If they succeed, the heroes can embark on an epic adventure to re-forge Quel'Delar. They will require the strongest materials and a source of great power to make this shattered blade into the fearsome weapon it once was. Several classes can use Quel'Delar, and the sword can fit several different play styles. For any class that is unable to wield it, however, the Sunreaver blood elves and the Silver Covenant high elves will gladly take this relic of their history in exchange for a usable weapon.<br />
<br />
Anyone care to speculate on what the bolded part means? Personally, I think we'll exchange it so the Sunreaver/Silver Covenant for a weapon that our class can use. I.E. you shaman, druids, and priests will get a mace or something while hunters such as myself will get to pick a bow. Yes, I guarantee it will be a bow.</div></div><hr />

This just seems like Naxx 2.0 without an upgrade to the bosses. Blizz made a raid in BC that hardly anyone got to see, so now they're giving people a legitimate reason to clear it.<br />

Haha tell me about it. We had our holy paladin, who has been late to only one raid in his life, miss out on that mace because of that one time he had to be late and they decided while he wasn't there. To make things worse, he has more hps everytime than any other healer, and the holy priest, who got the frags first, stopped playing for a long time. Then it went to a resto shaman who also stopped playing. Then a resto druid got them next, who transferred to horde. Of course, there are enough fragments for two of them but the holy Paladin, who has never missed a raid, still does not have it. Shit like this makes the drama over collecting fragments not worth it. <br />
<br />
Thankfully it is only a 5 man and not a raid quest like above.</div></div><hr />

Actually I'm pretty sure one of the quests is to talk to someone outside the raid to port you straight to the Sunwell itself and of course it will be phased so there's no mobs to annoy you...<br />
<br />
Also, how much you wanna bet they put no weapons in the heroic 5 mans and have this quest for people still running around with 219 weapons to be able to upgrade theirs to a 232... and if not then it will be 245 at the highest imo... just another way for people to catch up since you can't buy weapons with emblems...</div></div><hr />

The thing is Val'anyr is titan history not elven. The Sunreavers and the Silver Covenant are blood and high elfs, the sister blades are their history. Val'anyr will NOT be upgraded at all in this 5man instance quest line. Infact why did you even think it would?</div></div><hr />

Actually that doesn't make sense. I think they're referring to Quel'delar as being a relic. Not in the sense that it fits in that slot, but that it's &quot;an object or a personal item of religious significance.&quot; The exchange part is probably Blizzard saying, &quot;Hey, we're not going to leave it as a weapon that can only be used by people that can use swords.&quot; READ: The silver covenant will take in an item of historical significance in exchange for some other legendary. ;)</div></div><hr />

It's still a good blade of EPIC quality, not legendary that some ppl here seem to think.<br />
And since every class can use it I'll doubt it will be hard to get at all...</div></div><hr />

Hey, the Light has failed many times against the Scourge, but Paladins still go for it.<br />
<br />
Basically, the sword is still a pretty dang good sword.</div></div><hr />

Yes it's previous owners have failed to defend themselves using it against Arthas. However how many people have survived an all out attack? The sword did not shatter, it did not lose power. Look at Saurfang, his weapon was totally destroyed, now that is something id not want as my new weapon. One that took it's owner to destroy herself I can live with.</div></div><hr />

it's a weapon that fullfills the needs of the person wielding it. if that person is a warrior then it can be a tank weapon. if that person is a mage then it can be a caster weapon. if that person is a druid it will be whatever weapon the npc that you trade it into needs it to be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now...<br />
<br />
The champions of the Alliance and the Horde who confront the Lich King's armies have but a slim chance of finding the pieces of this fabled blade. If they succeed, the heroes can embark on an epic adventure to re-forge Quel'Delar. They will require the strongest materials and a source of great power to make this shattered blade into the fearsome weapon it once was. Several classes can use Quel'Delar, and the sword can fit several different play styles. For any class that is unable to wield it, however, the Sunreaver blood elves and the Silver Covenant high elves will gladly take this relic of their history in exchange for a usable weapon.<br />
<br />
The search begins soon...<br />
<br />
<br />
Here is my prediction.<br />
<br />
You also MUST remember that Blizzard has stated over and over again that the game has been geared towards a MORE casual community. That in combination with the line that &quot;Several classes can use Quel'Delar, and the sword can fit several different play styles&quot;, and the following line that &quot;For any class that is unable to wield it, however, the Sunreaver blood elves and the Silver Covenant high elves will gladly take this relic of their history in exchange for a usable weapon&quot; opens the 'fragments' or 'pieces' of the blade to EVERYONE in the game.<br />
<br />
Assume that there are 100 'pieces or fragments' that drop for the start of this quest. This would give the three new mini-dungeons a great piece to drop that players could far as well as the armies located around the Citadel. <br />
<br />
Although the drop rate may be very low, the ways in which you may get pieces or fragments would have to be increased as there are now 10 classes of players going for them.<br />
<br />
Upon gathering the required number of pieces or fragments, you can begin the quest which will lead you though different raids and what not to continue the story line.<br />
<br />
Prediction number 2.<br />
<br />
It is clearly a sword, which can be sued by different players for different things. I would predict that upon completion you can chose one of three or four different 'types' on the sword. A Tank Sword, DPS Sword, Spell Power Sword, and Healing Sword.<br />
<br />
For players which cannot use one of these combinations they will be able to take and exchange for any of given epics which will mostly likely hold a very high level as they will require a lot of work.</div></div><hr />

im sure the shards will drop more often than indicated. probably at least once in every icc 5 man heroic dungeon and players will roll for it.<br />

<br />
I don't get your logic, you kill a boss you get a lvl 232 weapon, you bust your ass to finish a long questline you get a lvl 232 weapon, not really logical if you ask me, and remembre you're not in pre-bc wow, blizzard wants everyone to get to end-game content so they're making things way easier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just cause it was once a weapon that was nice and now its broken doesn't make it beat shadowmourne. Shadowmourne is you and Darion Mograine actually making your own &quot;Legendary.&quot; That in itself is pretty cool because it's pretty much the first time that an orange is being put into the game that didnt formerly belong to anyone else, your basically creating a &quot;legend&quot; as you get closer to finishing Shadowmourne. <br />
<br />
Cooler then some hand-me down blade from a bunch of fail bloodelves who got face stomped by the lich king and then got all emo and broke it. (Go figure a BE being emo).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Remember we haven't had weapons (not counting wands) on the badge vendors since 3.0 and even then it was only off-hands.<br />
<br />
If they are truly wanting to open up the content to more people this gives a way for people to grab a weapon who have either been unlucky with raid drops, or who are newer to end game and perhaps wont have the opportunity to farm raids before heading for icc.<br />
<br />
It also adds a bit more flavour to the weapon than just farming heroics for triumphs.</div></div><hr />

Careful not to read too much in to that. For a start at the time of the defence of the Sunwell and Illidan and Kael's assault on the frozen throne the high elves were addicted to magic, ergo there were no warriors (It's the reason Belves can't play warriors currently). Secondly, even if there were, warrior doesn't necessarily indicate the class, it could just be a generic term for fighter. I believe I've been called a warrior of the horde in several quests despite the fact I'm a druid.<br />
<br />
I'm hoping since it's such a cool lore sword that it will indeed be really rare, and further that since it's apparently awesome if the person who's reforging it can indeed use it as a sword they'll get a slightly better weapon than those who trade it for generic fare with their respective factions. Also I'm interested about the sister sword, since I've never noticed it. Is it already in game somewhere or carried by a boss or something?<br />
<br />
Nevermind, found the relevant info on wowwikki. That suggests to me that these two would be the only prismatic blades worked on by all five flights. Also says something about Frostmourne given that it's able to overpower something created by all five flights combined.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That´s fail..<br />
<br />
The quest should be all about Quel Delar and this item will be obtained after completng this quest.<br />
Let´s saa it in other words: You will find an epic drop in a Boss. Why the fuck is it still the same shit that Shaman items drops even is there is no Shaman in the raid ? To keep the drill and the will to kill bosses... That´s it.<br />
If we change this to get the item you need all day, we will be finished very soon.<br />
<br />
You have to get Quel Delar... If it is not this way I can imagine that all classes will roll on the Quel Delar start item because everyone can use it in the end. That will be fun.. <br />
<br />
The day will come we will see the stats of this sword and the class releated to the sword will say HURRA... this is it but I will never get it because everyone can use it... How funny will that be...</div></div><hr />
