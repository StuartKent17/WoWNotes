These new forums should give a little more freedom to the growing community on the Video Games forums and should make most of you guys happier. If you're not happy enough, you can probably find an answer to your angry questions below. <br />
<br />
Why didn't you open a forum for [insert game here] when you opened one for [insert similar game here]??? [insult here]<br />
We only opened forums for games that already have a lot of activity on the Video Games forum in the first place. If your game isn't here, it just mean that we don't have a 5k+ replies thread about it, because not enough people are interested. Before someone points it out, 2 of the games with a new forum don't fill this requirements but I wanted them around anyway. <br />
<br />
Where are the Off-Topic forums? I can't find them on the forum index!<br />
The Off-Topic forums have been moved below the Class discussions forums, the entire section was just growing too big and WoW is still the main reason why people come to this site. Realistically you can still use the small arrow on the right of each category bar to collapse the entire category. <br />
<br />
I can't see the new forums in &quot;Recent Forum Posts&quot; on the front page.<br />
Intended, it would be too confusing for people looking for WoW threads (a huge majority of the visitors) to click something like &quot;Best Farming Spots?&quot; and end up in a Star Wars thread. For the moment, these forums won't show up on the front page but hopefully we'll have a way to do that in a non-annoying way soon. <br />
<br />
I want to moderate one of the new forums!<br />
Moderator Applications for the new forums will be open within 1 or 2 weeks, just to have time to identify people who will actually post there. <br />

Computers - Setup of the Month (by chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud))<br />
Each month or every 2 months, depending on the hardware evolutions, the lovely chaud (http://www.mmo-champion.com/members/523085-chaud) will work on a couple of hardware setups for those of you who are thinking of upgrading their computer!<br />
<br />
This month<br />
Now is a good time to buy a SSD, as the next generation is a good while away and the current prices are fairly flat (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2011/september/ssdgraph.gif). New AMD CPUs are rumored to arrive mid October, no confirmed information on them so far. New AMD GPUs are also rumored to be coming sometime in Q4 this year if you are thinking about upgrading.<br />
<br />
Make sure to keep your AMD (http://sites.amd.com/us/game/downloads/Pages/downloads.aspx) and Nvidia (http://www.nvidia.com/Download/index.aspx?lang=en-us) drivers up to date.<br />
<br />

That was mostly a comment directed at HoN/DoTA 2 players yeah. LoL is much much more popular than HoN and even if people have their personal preferences, we can't have a HoN forum just because we have a LoL one. <br />
<br />
The other alternative was to have a MOBA forum but I didn't really want to mix up HoN, LoL, and DoTA players in the same forum, I like when my users don't try to kill each other.</div></div><hr />

You really hoped they would have kept away those forums because you don't like the games. Stop being so narrow minded, now they have their own section, you wont even see it in the &quot;new post&quot; section on the front page. That in itself should make you happy, just don't go reading the forum, problem solved.<br />
<br />
Also stop flinging around words like &quot;retard&quot;, it'll just make you seem uneducated and...<br />

<br />
No MMO coming is going to kill WoW. Ever. Aion Failed, Warhammer Failed, age of Conan failed, Rift failed, Star Trek Online failed, DC Universe failed, Champions online failed. How many more do you need to fail to kill WoW? <br />
<br />
WoW won't die unless Blizzard decide to pull the plug which will never happen. They remain to be the most popular and most persistent MMO on the market. <br />
<br />
The announcement and Release of their next expansion will boost subscribers like it always does. I'm looking forward to Guild Wars 2, Diablo 3, Battlefield 3 and SWTOR might be played gameplay not looking so great.... but Im more anxious to see the new WoW expansion details! What new hero class may it bring? and where will we travel next? what new spells/talents will the current classes get? These things have me extremely anxious for BlizzCon or whenever Boub leaks info! like he did with Cata. Lol 'boub leak' teehee xD</div></div><hr />

You completely missing the point sherlock.<br />
If it is for narrow minded, then it is you as you have no grasp on what i mean.<br />
I never played any of those games, so i can't tell if they are cool or not, which i never implied either. Thats one argument from your side down the drain.<br />
Secondly i hardly see any WoW players bashing here on other games, yet i see a lot of 'quiters' here bash on WoW and how a new game would detroy it.<br />
So giving those ppl their own URL would not have them on this WoW forum anymore and stopping the threads i mentioned before, thats two.<br />
<br />
About the fact that in your world of logics someone using the word 'retard' seem uneducated im not even going to defend as it's full of &lt;put random silly word here&gt;.<br />

The best conversations were happening in the Other Video Games forum for SW:TOR, GW2, and Rift. Nice that they have a dedicated home.Its also a good strategy for the site. Should WoW's decline continue, MMO Champion can leverage the seeds of community in the sub forums to grow a replacement audience down the road. Its a win/win for everyone.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Same can be said of all MMO's out there.<br />
<br />
Most do not care one bit about WoW nor even care about trying to come close to their numbers.<br />
All they want is to make a game that their fans and players can enjoy while playing.<br />
<br />
Hell I play Star Trek Online,Champions Online,Rift,World of Warcraft,Lord of the Rings Online and a few other MMO's and enjoy my time in every one of them.<br />
And when Guild Wars 2 and Star Wars:TOR come out I will probably play them as well.<br />
<br />
Nice to see the site finally living up to it's name and giving other MMO's a place.</div></div><hr />

Looking for a good value graphics card myself right now, but comments on various sites about XFX cards have me seriously wary, so wanted to know your take. Thanks.</div></div><hr />

Because the decrease of WoW players is probably mirrored by a decrease of active users here?<br />

Not sure it has much to do with that at all really. Their own polling pretty clearly indicated half of us just come here because the site is cool and the mods are not complete dicks. <br />
<br />
I left WoW 2 years ago, and hang out in the sub forums now. It made since for a long time now that this was coming especially with a decided date for WoW to be ended in 2014. It is a safe bet and if one game just falls apart and dies then the sub forum can be removed no harm done.<br />
<br />
The issue with the single thread thing was just as an example in Rift. When I posted the patch notes alone it took up an entire page and people could actually miss the updates. Also the ToR thread had like 1,400 pages and 1,000,000 views you are a moron to not try and capitalize on that.</div></div><hr />

You're talking about those threads that have existed since the beginning of the world...of warcraft, right?<br />

From a business point of view, it makes sense for an MMO website named MMO-Champion to create more content for people who player other games. More visitors means more revenue dollars. It doesn't mean that a game is &quot;dying.&quot; I don't understand why people think that you have to be monogamous with one game.

<br />
that monogamous approach was what was dictated on this website and the forums I've seen people's threads get closed because they either talked about wow DYING or when they brought up other MMO's like RIFT. It wasn't just the attitude of the players it was how this site treated the MMO community, it was LOVE WOW or GTFO!<br />
<br />

<br />
Well, because it's pretty much impossible. For most people, their schedule on most days only leaves a few hours in which to play video games. Trying to juggle two different MMOs on top of work/school would be frustrating, to say the least. Eventually, they'd want to choose one as their main game, and relegate the other to the &quot;only check out new expansions&quot; pile. A million people already chose to drop WoW *without* competition, what'll happen when there are finally legit, highly-polished not-just-WoW-clones alternatives? <br />
<br />
The winds have been changing for over a year now. Even if SWTOR/GW2 do not take a single sub away from WoW, it's already bleeding 150k subs/month. Assuming the next expansion hits halfway through next year, that gives Cata an 18-month lifetime. 18 x 150k = 2.7 million subs. And that's WITHOUT factoring in SWTOR/GW2. WoW has never been this vulnerable, and the competition has never been this strong - that's why the new forums make sense.<br />
<br />
I know some people don't want to accept it, but while WoW will continue going strong for years yet, it's not going to be the undisputed #1 for much longer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I have a mix between Dolphin and Narwal, and I can get 40-60 FPS in cities/raids, and 60-120 FPS everywhere else. I think a Puppy would easily be able to let you play WoW, with minimal lag, maybe around 30-50 FPS average.</div></div><hr />

They just don't have the financial, support, history, experience or anything comparable to a Blizzard genre game. So yeah definitely a laugh for anyone thinking MMO's like rift, warhammer, aoc, the old SW mmo, etc would replace WoW. <br />
<br />
Diablo 3 won't replace it either because its a Starcraft 2..a different genre game. <br />
<br />
Although however unlikely and it is definitely unlikely, if there was ever an MMO that had the potential to severely dent even replace WoW; it would be a Star Wars MMO. It commands a very strong fan base with a history that long super cedes any of Blizzards products most notable the Warcraft series. This Star Wars game has had an enormous financial backing as indicated by the ncredibly large budget numbers and its being developed by reputable companies with significant support. <br />
<br />
No mmorpg in the history of gaming will have had the potential for a successful WoW be-heading than this upcoming game; Star Wars: The Old Republic. <br />
<br />
We'll see how it unravels.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They wouldn't be drawn away from this site though. There are the video game forums after all where all those games have been discussed for awhile and would still be discussed even if there were no dedicated sub forums for them. So yeah your wish for these people to leave would of never happened to begin with.<br />

<br />
WoW doesn't have a decided end date of 2014. I assume you're referencing the leaked product slate that lists things like the WoW Brazil and things like that. Well I would hope you would realize that is most likely a five year plan for releases. Notice how pretty much after Titan is released on that chart nothing is coming out not even Titan expansions. That chart is just Blizzard planning for the future but not too far into the future.</div></div><hr />
