Wrathgate booster set for tabletop game based on Blizzard Entertainment's award-winning World of Warcraft series slated for May release, followed by Class Decks in June<br />
Irvine, California – (March 24, 2010) – Cryptozoic Entertainment is pleased to announce that they have signed a long-term licensing agreement with Blizzard Entertainment. The multi-year arrangement grants Cryptozoic the right to produce the trading card game (TCG) based on Blizzard Entertainment's hugely popular World of Warcraft® massively multiplayer online role-playing game series. <br />
<br />
“This is an exciting time for us and for players of the trading card game,” said John Nee, Cryptozoic Entertainment’s CEO. “Our first priority will be to maintain the current programs that the community has come to expect and then build from there. The game itself is fantastic, and will not change. The community can rest assured that we are committed to providing them with the high quality product and organized play that they deserve, worldwide.” <br />
<br />
“It's important to us and to our players that every entertainment experience set in a Blizzard Entertainment game universe matches the standards we've established with our games,” said Paul Sams, Chief Operating Officer of Blizzard Entertainment. “We're proud of the quality and accessible gameplay that the World of Warcraft TCG has offered to date, and we're confident that Cryptozoic is the best team to help us continue that tradition.”<br />
<br />
Cryptozoic will continue to expand the World of Warcraft TCG for years to come. Players will soon have a slew of exciting new cards to test their skills and defeat their opponents with at the upcoming Continental Championships in June and the World Championship in August. The first product release from Cryptozoic will be the Wrathgate boosters in May followed by the Class Decks in June.<br />
<br />
“Having been fully involved with the development of the World of Warcraft TCG from day one, I've always been passionate about taking it into the future,” said Cory Jones, Cryptozoic’s President and Chief Creative Officer, and formerly Blizzard Entertainment's lead business and development liaison for the TCG. “I'm pleased to say that the players have a lot to look forward to as we continue developing and evolving the game to match the action and spirit of World of Warcraft.”<br />
<br />
To start, players can get the latest news on the World of Warcraft TCG at www.cryptozoic.com. Then in just a few weeks a brand new website for the TCG itself will launch. Cryptozoic promises ongoing updates on everything from organized play to product releases as well as a regular dose of strategy articles and spoilers as they get closer to their initial product launch.<br />

30 minutes LFD Debuff<br />
We're keeping a close eye on the discussions, feedback and in-game information for this. We don't have any current plans to make changes, and it seems a bit soon to start considering them, but we are paying attention to constructive discussion and feedback on this change.

Random Battlegrounds Queue Times<br />
There's a known bug that isn't properly incorporating random battleground queuers with those choosing specific battlegrounds. This can lead to queue times that are longer than what they should be.<br />
<br />
A hotfix is in the process of being developed and we anticipate it should be applied within the next day or two. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/23767194400-random-battlegrounds-are-here.html))<br />

Let healers DPS in Cataclysm?<br />
Ideas that would make healing more fun are good things to discuss in this forum, particularly with an eye towards Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
The idea to let healers dps a little is a controversial one though. Some healers just have no interest in it, so while it might make healing a lot more fun for you, it risks making healing a lot less fun for them. I would not approach that idea as an obviously intuitive one that all healers will rally around, because I suspect that's just not the case. :( <br />
<br />
[...] I could see that if the tree was structured in such a way that you had to give up a little bit of healing for that dps (and to be fair, talents like Searing Light already exist), such that it was the kind of thing you might do while soloing or running easy content (like Dungeon Finder when overgeared). In other words, I wouldn't want us to do it in such a way that healers were then balanced around doing damage -- like we calculated healer damage when we come up with boss berserk timers. Then it goes from a playstyle choice to being the only way to play. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/23214131243-healing-and-cataclysm-needs-more-fun-styles.html))<br />
<br />
Commendations of Service - It's fun to click 400 times!<br />
As a one time thing it's really not that big of a deal. You could always do it in increments if you are getting bored. I also ended up figuring out a pretty easy way to do it where I had the vendor box open, I'd keep trading in the BG tokens, and just put the honor token on my 1 key so I was watching/reading other things while just spamming right click + 1 and going through all of them. <br />
<br />
What if the 2 second cooldown was 0 seconds instead.<br />
I believe that's more of a safety net to help lower hits on the hardware. These are tougher things to explain but imagine 100 players crunching at the tokens together in the same place, that could lead to issues for these players and others so it's better to be safe. Oops, used the same reasoning again in another post... <br />
<br />
Bugs and Test Dummies<br />
If you ever notice a bug, one of the very first things you should probably do is consider if it's a test dummy problem. We've had several false positives reported since we first implemented them, and in fact that's one reason we avoided putting in test dummies for so long.<br />
<br />
Which is not to say that actual bugs don't creep in too. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/23767644228-pyroblast-not-gaining-from-ttw.html))<br />

Spirit Beasts<br />
The Spirit Beasts were added as a way to capture that old feeling of having to hunt (which really means be very patient and very lucky) to get rare spawn pets so that you'd feel awesome and be able to show them off. Making those creatures actually more powerful than other pets goes completely counter to that design. If the frustratingly rare spawn is needed for highest possible dps, there would be a lot of exasperated hunters out there, and I think they'd be totally justified.<br />
<br />
Spirit Beasts are the hunter equivalent of the Time Lost Protodrake. They are there for bragging rights, not max dps.<br />
<br />
We're not sure yet what we're going to do for hunter pets in the future. I fear that even if the dps gain was marginal that hunters would still go for the highest dps pets, so really there only exists an illusion of choice. We could literally make all of the pet families do the exact dps and have rather watered down special abilities (because otherwise one of them might grant a 1 or 2% dps benefit and that would end up being the pet again).<br />
<br />
In other words, I can see a design where pet choice is purely cosmetic and pet stats are identical or I can see a design where pet choice matters, in which case you don't really have that many to choose from on content that matters.

Molten Fury and Torment of the Weak<br />
We think we figured out a problem here with the Molten Fury talent not playing well with Torment the Weak.

Indeed. I didn't read any post yet, just saw the arts and went &quot;wow!!&quot;<br />
<br />
Female Illidian vs Female Arthas is awesome. If it is ever implemented in game (which it won't :P), it will be a dream come true for me.<br />

But once you start going into that tree your committed until you respec your pet again. This is one are where homogenizing is the answer unfortunately because one is always going to be marginally better and cosmetics don't matter in a raid environment, only doing the most your character can. And for those who say my $14.99 says I can play how I want, well the rest of the raids $359.76 says shut up, know your role and bring your best.</div></div><hr />

Yes, it was 100% instead of 20% was pretty nice and made for an excellent fury rotation for a night, now we're back to open GCDs and spamming HS<br />

You are right. Everything I see with goat legs become a draenai for me, especially if it's a female :P. The goat legs are really miss leading. You can see purplish night elf skin clearly in the picture and no tail, which I noticed after reading the comments here. Awesome fan arts nonetheless :D</div></div><hr />

For example, a crocolisk could cause your serpent sting to increase all damage caused by poisons on that target by 5% and a boar could increase the attack power of anyone attacking a target afflicted by hunter's mark (not just ranged attack power). <br />
<br />
Either that or have them be really useful on some fights. Like have a plainstrider have cleanse available for 5 focus.</div></div><hr />

Not sure how it really works, it's how it did for me: <br />
<br />
Healer priest, freshly dinged 80, full blues, enter daily heroic. <br />
I got groups of noobs after noobs, flamers, douchebags, people with no idea how to play, people entering the oculus half leaves at start, other half as they see the drakes and go &quot;wtf?&quot;, people wiping on Anub Arak, no, not in Coliseum, in the dungeon, standing in pound and running around like headless chicken on add phase. <br />
<br />
So I went to farm TOC, FOS, POS normal until I was sick of it. <br />
First, queues were much longer. You get only gearing up people, some odds doing daily normal for gold, rarely someone needs quel quest. <br />
I ran into issues like complaining on gearscores (my usual answer was stfu it's not heroic) or &quot;kick that plate he'll take my gear&quot;. <br />
After 3 days of farming I got almost full 219 epics with few level 200, few blues. <br />
<br />
A miracle! <br />
I stopped being put in noob groups. It's back to what I encounter on my main, where a noob in the group is anecdotal appearance you laugh about in &quot;worst stuff that happened in your pug&quot; thread it's not 80%-90% of people you're grouped with! (And then it was impossible to complete any instance or it took hours with people being replaced all the time.) <br />
<br />
Or, and I asked every friend and guildie going to daily heroic to take me along. His &quot;gearscore&quot; allowed us to get better people to group and also make the run easier. <br />
<br />
I always used to believe skill &gt; gearscore, but you rarely meet ICC geared people with no skill. <br />

Why love-hate? <br />
Hate, because when you're in blues, when it's hardest for you, you get bad groups, making it even harder, and you feel discriminated and frustrated. <br />
Love, because once you're through that purgatory, you're saved from worst groups I'd never had idea existed (it can't be that bad can it? oooh yes it can)</div></div><hr />

The politest way I can reply to this is with 2 questions: <br />
1. How long have you been using the internet?<br />
2. How long have you been paying attention to the medieval fantasy genre?<br />
<br />
In the medieval fantasy genre all male characters have several, if not all, of the following:<br />
- extremely long beards (reserved for caster style characters and wise old men)<br />
- muscles the size of a normal person's head<br />
- extremely large genitals (political correctness FTL!)<br />
- a strange tendency to make war on any other male character they see, especially if they happen to be of a different race<br />
<br />
In the medieval fantasy genre all female characters have several, if not all, of the following:<br />
- long, flowing hair<br />
- extremely large breasts<br />
- extremely curved hips<br />
- a strange tendency to fall in love with male characters of different races<br />
<br />
These are all taken as standard when it comes to the genre. Chill our, relax, and accept that this is the world you've walked into.<br />
<br />
You may also want to look up &quot;Rule 34&quot;.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">-Scarecrow-</div><div class="date">2010-03-25, 01:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">These are all taken as standard when it comes to the genre. Chill our, relax, and accept that this is the world you've walked into.<br />
<br />
Yes, and I'm sure the entire world agrees on this standard.<br />
<br />
The fan art itself is nicely made but for me it's utterly demolished since it seems they are all on their way to some beach party or sex orgie.<br />
<br />
I suppose I should say hi since this is my first post but why bother.</div></div><hr />

Men and women have always been objectified in the medieval fantasy genre and I see no problem with either. I really can't understand why anyone would.<br />
<br />
On-topic: I really hope they figure out a model that works for hunter pets. While they are different there is not choice, you just pick whatever does the most dps. If they are the same then it's just a skin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So where is the hot sexy male version of Jaina Proudmoore and garona?<br />
Where they are completely covered in sweat and erect bodyparts flexing to go at &quot;it&quot;?<br />
<br />
There is a fine line between sexual ideas and blatant over the top &quot;everybody likes titties right?&quot; dogma in art.<br />
<br />
<br />
The art is fine, but it is nothing I haven't seen 1000 times before, it is getting old. I had the titty phase once as well then i grew out of it and discovered that the difference between men and women lies somewhere else<br />
Then again I am no virgin nor a geek so the average geek guy here must think I am a religious racist when i say that women have vaginas.</div></div><hr />

Originally, WoW had several different types of leg armor that were commonly referred to as &quot;Steel Thongs&quot;, due to an outcry from some of the player base that this Teen rated game was too risque, those leg armors were changed. Sure you can still find some of them out there, the Alliance keep in Blasted Lands has many of the original models on the NPC's, but it's kind of sad that Blizz isn't willing to stick by the rating of their game. At least these fan arts do an awesome job depicting how epic their armor is.<br />

This (among other, better, reasons) is why every family member should have their own account on the family computer. You can have sexy dead elf wallpaper, but junior can have Thomas the Tank Engine (Until he hits 11 or 12 and wants sexy dead elf wallpaper). You can also make sure that all the crap that your kids want running in the background isn't impacting your game performance. You can even limit installation privileges to the &quot;adult&quot; accounts to minimize the amount of crap being installed in the first place (Unless your significant other is as bad as the kids).</div></div><hr />

I still say that one looked like she had velcro tits stuck on after the fact. I don't object to fully clothed women in fan art, at all in fact, but she didn't look any more natural than the chainmail bikini crowd. She just looked unnatural in a different (honestly even worse) way.</div></div><hr />

I just cant agree. I like Sylvanas (is that?) in the fan art showed. But hey, she is going into combat in ice hearted land literally naked. I dont buy that.

Sure you can still find some of them out there, the Alliance keep in Blasted Lands has many of the original models on the NPC's, but it's kind of sad that Blizz isn't willing to stick by the rating of their game. At least these fan arts do an awesome job depicting how epic their armor is.<br />

You need to think more carefully before spouting this rubbish.<br />
<br />
It has nothing to do with teen ratings, atleast for a large amount of people who put the arguement across against platemail bikini's. It has everything to do the needless sexualization of female characters and how *WOMAN PLAYERS* actually do not like this kind of thing.

Sylvanas has always been the female character with most sex appeal. Im guess you didn't play warcraft three. She had huge cleavage to the point where it was almost a joke. So yes it is a perfect resemblance to the personality of the subject.<br />

Come down off of your cloud, Andrea Dworkin. Many female players DO like looking like that, and given informal tallies, I'd say they like their (female) characters to look interesting/attractive. Beside, I think being beaten down by a female character in skimpy armor is all the more humiliating to the hulking plate wearing types. Let's put it this way: WoW is not going to have Berquas as cloth armor items any time soon.</div></div><hr />

Lol I was just saying that to one of my buddies at work that also plays WoW. XD But it is getting old seeing fan art with half naked chicks fighting. The fan art is good, I can tell that the artits... err I mean artists are very talented. But still it would be nice to see fully clothed females for once. Just my 2 cents.<br />
<br />
Even though I have female characters in games, I never have them wear something like that. I play characters that are both male and female to have something different to look at instead of them being all male, which is my gender.</div></div><hr />

<br />
because once you lose your virginity you become completely uninterested in images of scantily-clad, idealised women. ::)<br />
<br />
On a completely other note though, the blatant fanservice does irritate me, in games like oblivion (just ignore the hundreds of mods) female characters look great with more than just a thong. Kind of sucky that the plate bikini is the standard for female clothing in games.</div></div><hr />

This is my favorite part of the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; (and before you start, yes there are also many things to dislike about the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot;, this just happens to be a thing I *do* like), the strength of the female characters and the way each sex's and culture's ideas of gender &quot;roles&quot; are constantly being kicked around.

No problem with that, i like that picture a lot too ;)<br />
Just saying many like it just becouse its &quot;naked&quot; woman. Imagine a man there instead. Or robot. It wouldnt be the same.<br />
Its like some add on leather sofa i saw few weeks ago. Would it sell (drag attention) if there was only sofa ? Probably. Would it if there was &quot;naked&quot; woman lying on the sofa ? Very likely. This dragging women into adds becouse of sex and symbols to sell something ... its not that bad, but you should really know the limit - what is tasteful</div></div><hr />

Ideas that would make healing more fun are good things to discuss in this forum, particularly with an eye towards Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
The idea to let healers dps a little is a controversial one though. Some healers just have no interest in it, so while it might make healing a lot more fun for you, it risks making healing a lot less fun for them. I would not approach that idea as an obviously intuitive one that all healers will rally around, because I suspect that's just not the case. <br />
<br />
[...] I could see that if the tree was structured in such a way that you had to give up a little bit of healing for that dps (and to be fair, talents like Searing Light already exist), such that it was the kind of thing you might do while soloing or running easy content (like Dungeon Finder when overgeared). In other words, I wouldn't want us to do it in such a way that healers were then balanced around doing damage -- like we calculated healer damage when we come up with boss berserk timers. Then it goes from a playstyle choice to being the only way to play. &quot;<br />
<br />
People who have seen me most know my repsonse to this. They already had it in BC shockadin. Primarily a healer, but could defend itself in pvp and in heroics without much CC used could do well on the damage meters because of high consecrate damage. However, in no way (because of instant OOM and large threat issues) a raid damage dealer, and I think they had the balance perfect with BC shockadin or the week they ghave us shockadin back in April with the original exorcism change only to give us shockadin nuts virtual blue balls in the largest cock tease in the history of wow. Simply make exocism a gauenteed instant via talent mid/deep holy tree so ret couldn't get it or make judgement of righteousness scale high the way it used to in such a way ret woudn't get undue use of it. Primarily a healer, able to defend itself and do a little damage in pve like 5 mans but not a raid dps at all. That perfect balance they had would be welcomed back and in no way OP to real dps. <br />
<br />
Not sure how to pull off that balance with other healer classes but they had it perfect with Shockadin.</div></div><hr />

AND she does it by choice because she thinks it's the smexy-est look of all the mortal races, go figure... (this was blizzard's idea too, not the fan artists) blame the fan art all you want, but they are the ones drawing art of something that was already sexualized by blizzard.<br />

Really, in these games, men are ungodly strong and women are ungodessly curved. Fantasy genres have always hyper-sexualized characters of both sexes (and by both, I mean both, replace the females with the originals... they are still stupidly strong looking and illidan still fights with no shirt on), so get over it and enjoy the fact that the artists are still really talented even if they choose to use rule 63 as their base of operations; people bitching about it are just as sad as the people drooling at it, they are just at opposite ends of extremes.</div></div><hr />
