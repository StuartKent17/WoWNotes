Item changes<br />

Tanking as frost<br />
We adjusted Frost Presence to make up for the nerfs to Icebound Fortitude, Bone Shield and the change to bonus armor from jewelry etc. (Most raiding DK tanks were Unholy at the time, though they have begun to branch out a little.)<br />
<br />
Both of those abilities are intended to be more like Shield Block or Last Stand, not something that is up all the time like Frost Presence itself. In most of the estimates I have seen that figure this is a huge nerf use pretty unrealistic estimates of how much Bone Shield is up (thinking their avoidance can make up for the charges). But we can check out numbers again. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/26/13832573744-gcs-take-on-bone-shield.html))<br />

seems like you dont know to much about DKs. since this in now way will make dks able to spam chains of ice MORE. either it will be as much as now, or less since they will use the death rune for something else.</div></div><hr />

That scaling idea is interesting. We'll talk about it some more.<br />
<br />
Your interpretation is off. The problem with pets is they scale too well -- raid-buffed, pets do amazing damage (while without buffs they can't hold aggro over their hunter). An example of how broken pet scaling is: Blessing of Might on a pet provides a bigger raid DPS increase than BoM on a Rogue.<br />
<br />
The theory put forth by players is that if pets scaled more appropriately (in line with their hunter, for instance), they could be both useful solo/5manning and not overpowered in a full-raid-buff situation.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
If you're an engineer, this is one of the most serious problems. First off, we shouldn't be replacing them with 4 horseman / T7. The only real reason they were better than the BS one was that the BS one lacked a meta socket; now that it has one, especially as a paladin tank to whom expertise (which is on the goggles) is near useless, I'm becoming seriously tempted to drop my goggles. That's just wrong.</div></div><hr />

Lawl, not like you're in a worse position than engineering. Btw Inscription still has ridiculous shoulder chants whereas I have to do the Sons of Hodir dailies for the next two weeks straight (already 4k into revered) to hit exalted to get a mediocre chant in comparison. <br />
I got a tanking helm out of engineering. Not a great one but a decent entry level helmet. Well as soon as I replace it I may as well drop engineering. WTF is the point of a profession that doesn't have anything to offer anybody after they upgrade from the _ONE_ half decent item available. It's not like I can't get a motorcycle even if I managed to get the 13.5k needed to freaking make it cause it's boe. <br />
Engineering literally has NOTHING to offer. Remember to take into account that ilvl 200 items are the equivalent of ilvl 115 items from Karazhan, so yes the helm is useful now but it's literally only as useful as long as Naxx and malygos are the top tier raid instance. <br />
And with regards to upgrading the helm every new raid tier like the SW:P goggles those had a ridiculously low drop rate. Out of 25+ raids we never saw the pattern drop once, may as well just pick up the T8 helm and skip the upgrading goggles part if they do decide to include that (which I doubt)</div></div><hr />

Summary of the link:<br />
Does not scale from spell power (or attack power), can crit (for 150% damage), has an internal cooldown of 45 seconds. The ICD makes the card worth much less than many people would like, considering the materials required to create it (oh RNG, how I love thee). The change from haste to crit won't increase it's abilities.</div></div><hr />

Exactly. Tailoring stuff was made a little worse and BoE, but in exchange they get a flying mount, which is Engineering's thing, and they get pants and cloak enchants that are ridiculously cheap in comparison to the regular ones. I wouldn't be complaining about the goggles being worse if, for example, the motorcycle was BoP, or the tinkers (enchants we can apply to our gloves) were better or cheaper and equivalent to tailoring ones. But they aren't. That's why they need to dial up the goggles.</div></div><hr />

It's not that we want them to be godly - we just want them to be up to standards. It simply does not make sense to have a BoE crafted item that is better than a BoP which is supposed to be one of the very few perks of the engineering profession.</div></div><hr />

So you can make a quest reward (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=10398) with engineering? Interesting. Where do you have eng? At skill lvl 1 on a bank alt?<br />
<br />
I for my part had it at 375. Half a year ago. Nowadays my 2 chars are JC/BS and JC/alch. Both professions give me quite noticeable stat bonuses (which eng doesn't provides since the tinkers are *worse* than regular enchants). And from JC I get on top of that very nice trinkets (far FAR better ones than those eng makes) and of cource superior moneymaking capabilities (250g daily anyone?).<br />
<br />
Every professions has some flavour perks. One thing which caused me to keep eng far longer than I would have otherwise were the transporter malfunction &quot;costumes&quot; in BC. But the mad alchemist pots were also very nice from alch. And on top of that I got that insanely good alchemist stone from shattered sun. So I finally switched.<br />
<br />
The situation in LK is if anything worse for Eng. It has now even less perks than in BC and lost any resemblence of stat bonuses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And which of these 2 is better now? The quest reward.<br />
<br />
The battle chicken is utterly useless for PvP, PvE because obvious reasons so all you have is the &quot;novelity&quot; (as much as you can speak of it considering it is a vanilla wow item) of a robot chicken following you around.<br />
<br />
And lets compare there.<br />
Eng: 1.5 min duration, 20 min cooldown, requires bag &amp; trinket slot.<br />
Quest: unlimited duration, no cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard said months ago that they considered the tailoring/eng pieces in BC too powerful and a mistake.<br />
<br />
Actually they only gave stunherald and frozen shadowweave as examples there, they never ever mentioned eng.<br />
To the contrary actually, they stated that they thought the eng nerf from vanilla wow -&gt; BC was a little too big and that they wanted to fix it.<br />
<br />
Of cource, they decided to &quot;nerf&quot; the epic crafteables of all profs, but the thing is: All other profs *exept* engineering got compensated for that. The dragons eyes of JC, the 2 extra gem sockets of BS, the bracer enchants of LW,... (well, almost every other prof - tailoring isn#t too well of either, but it is still in a better place than eng)<br />
<br />
Your so &quot;great&quot; hyperspeed glove enchants are an average haste rating of 32 over time, thats compared to the regular glove enchants no major boost. BS &amp; JC can get that much *and* the glove enchants. And of cource they can finetune their bonuses too and are not stuck with haste which isn't usefull for many class/specs.<br />
<br />
When you look at leatherworking their bracer enchants are designed that way that their power is including the normal bracer enchants (i.e. the LW stam bracer enchant - the new 40 stam regular bracer enchant = ~the stam bonus you cna get from BS or JC).<br />
This loss of the enchant bonus is what hasn't been included in the eng glove bonus and that is part of the problem. The other one is the lack of any variety of tinkers (tinkers which are better than regular enchants, mind you. A cloak parachute enchant is pretty useless outside arathi basin.).<br />
<br />
I went through every single tier of BC content wearing goggles and personally I got a little sick of them.<br />
<br />
My guild is still using BC-era repair bots, and I'm partial to the Hyperspeed Accelerators. Engineering has never offered large raid benefits - if you took it for the goggles you're an idiot and deserve your sub-standard BoP gear.<br />

&quot;Engineering makes a fun robot chicken!&quot;<br />
&quot;No it doesn't, you're stupid&quot;<br />
~link to robot chicken made by engineering~<br />
&quot;Ok it makes a robot chicken, but I'm still right because it's not a level 80 robot chicken&quot;<br />

<br />
I never read one about stunherald being too good for raiding, just a generic one about BoP crafted items being better than raid gear. There was no &quot;engineering nerf&quot; from vanilla to BC - engineering got tons of items that were actually useful beyond being just toys: it just wasn't useful in Arenas after having previously established itself as &quot;the pvp profession&quot; thanks to grenade stuns.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Won't argue with that. It's 100% true.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
I never described it as &quot;great&quot;. I said I personally liked it. Yeah, if you put blowing it into a macro it's only 32 haste over time. As a healer I don't do those kind of things or evaluate gear that way - I save cooldowns for when I need them.<br />
<br />
<br />
A cloak parachute enchant is pretty useless outside arathi basin.<br />
<br />
It owns on a PvP server. Have you ever seen a druid jump off one of Wrath's many many cliffs, knowing they will drop out of combat to shift to flight form and escape? I follow them off.</div></div><hr />

Fail. They explicitly buffed the farming professions to have certain boni so you keep them instead of getting a second crafting profession. Technically nerfing herbalism is a huge step backwards.</div></div><hr />

First off, we shouldn't be replacing them with 4 horseman / T7. The only real reason they were better than the BS one was that the BS one lacked a meta socket; now that it has one, especially as a paladin tank to whom expertise (which is on the goggles) is near useless, I'm becoming seriously tempted to drop my goggles. That's just wrong.<br />
<br />
<br />
Face it....<br />
<br />
All crafted gear in existence in this expansion is to get you INTO raiding. Its not designed to let you skip raiding content (even 10 man). It will be easily replaced in the 10 mans (all of it is replaced in 10 and some is even replaced in heroics). The mats are insane considering this, but as more and more people figure this out the items will be less in demand. I'm personally dropping engineering for JC now that I have the 4h helm from Naxx10.</div></div><hr />

I'd say it would start around 2k and drop to 1k or lower once more people get into the raids and get better items.</div></div><hr />

In case you missed the memo, FSW and spellfire were also ridiculously good, and now crafted tailoring sets are decent and BoE. Blizzard said they didnt want OP BoP gear from professions, so I don't know why you think your precious goggles should be an exception.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because they are the ONLY bop items that are crafted epics. I'm all for them making them mediocre, but they need to take the stupid arctic cloud finding ability off of them (eternal air does not sell for that much), take the bop off of them, take the engineering requirement off of them and make them an item people that don't have engineering would actually be interested in buying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe they should of thought of this when they forget to include defense on higher level raiding gear which requires you to have JC just to get the decent defense gems in order to stay defense capped over your raiding career. Right now, almost every single gem I have has defense on it, all of my enchants that can be defense are, and I still have to fight to get more defense with every &quot;upgrade&quot;.</div></div><hr />

As a ret paladin, I actually prefer critical strike rating to agility. This was a larger nerf for warriors in my opinion. Critical strike rating actually affects my spells on the small chance I need to off heal.</div></div><hr />

Chains of Ice costs a frost rune. If they are going to spam Chains of Ice, then changing it into a Death Rune will have absolutely no effect.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
There are 3 engineering issues: <br />
1) the bizarre is that there was no Healing plate goggles and some issue with druids IIRC. I don't understand how those could have been left out or it take so long to fix.<br />
2) the troubling is that the l80 goggles aren't out yet (i.e. as the JB 3000 replaced the 2000. ) If it weren't Bliz and engineering, then one would just wait patiently without worry for 3.1<br />
3) The fatal problem is that bliz said it wanted to make all professions viable. Yet Engineering and IIRC tailoring are not, there is nothing in engineering comparable to the ring enchants, JC only gems, BS-only sockets, etc. that add about 38 sp. They need to renounce the goal of making all professions viable or add something to engineering.</div></div><hr />
