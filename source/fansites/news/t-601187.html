As you may have noticed, the Vanish talent isn't functioning perfectly. Sometimes this talent will be activated immediatly, but on other occasions an attack from an enemy can happen after you triggered the talent. This comes from the fact that the attack has been registered in the server data before the activation of the talent, but not in your client's, which are consequently not 100% reliable. <br />
<br />
We're doing our best to provide the best possible functionning and reactivity. However, it is possible that sometimes some actions don't happen in the same order as the one of your combat log. The principal cause of this malfunction is either an inappropriate usage of the talent (this ability doesn't always allow you to get through) or a problem linked to the server registering the informations in a different order than the one you get, caused by internet and the latency problems affecting it.<br />
