Patch 8.1 - Demonology Warlock Changes<br />
In the current build up on the PTR (Public Test Realm), a few changes were made to the Demonic Consumption level 100 talent:<br />
<br />
<br />
Any imp that the Demonic Tyrant consumes now has a chance to grant you the Demonic Core (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/267102-demonic-core) buff. If your Tyrant consumes six imps when summoned, you have six individual chances to get a Demonic Core buff applied to you.<br />
The damage buff to the Demonic Tyrant from consuming the Wild Imps is now much higher.<br />
<br />
One additional note about the Demonic Tyrant (https://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/265187-summon-demonic-tyrant): <br />
<br />
In an upcoming build, the Demonic Tyrant will also extend the duration of any demons summoned from the Nether Portal level 100 talent.<br />
<br />
<br />
Play with the Blues - Nov 8<br />
We're planning another testing session for the new Darkshore Warfront coming in Tides of Vengeance, and would love for you to join us!<br />
<br />
Tomorrow, November 8, beginning at 4 PM Pacific time (7 PM Eastern), we'll be queuing for the new Warfront. As with previous tests, we'll be making a couple PTR-only changes: there will be special queuing tables set up in Orgrimmar and Zandalar, and any character level 110 or higher will be able to participate.<br />
<br />
Additionally, there are a couple of changes to the Darkshore zone that we've enabled for testing purposes which we'd like to clarify. All of the Darkshore World Quests are currently active on PTR, and both factions are able to loot the treasures scattered around the zone. After release, only the faction that currently holds the zone will be able to loot the treasures, and only a handful of the World Quests will be enabled at any one time.<br />
<br />
We hope to see you tomorrow evening!<br />

WoW Secret Finding Discord Discovers Music Secret in Waycrest Manor<br />
The WoW Secret Finding Discord (https://discord.gg/wowsecrets) has discovered the musical easter egg in Waycrest Manor (https://warcraft-secrets.com/musical-easter-egg-waycrest-manor) that was mentioned during the Immersive Sounds of Azeroth Panel (https://www.mmo-champion.com/content/8134-Immersive-Sounds-of-Azeroth) at Blizzcon.<br />
<br />
<br />
5 pipe organs afflicted by drust magic are found throughout Waycrest Manor. <br />
Walking near them spawns a witch that you need to kill.<br />
Lady Waycrest will become angry and play a discord chord on her organ when you kill one.<br />
After you have killed all 5 witches and cleared the instance, return to &quot;The Grand Foyer&quot; at the entrance.<br />
After a few minutes music from other Blizzard games will begin to play!<br />
<br />
<br />
The music plays a loop of 6 familiar tracks.<br />
<br />

When their market is 12-30 year old Chinese males (hundreds of millions of people) then yes, they will make a lot of money on MTX. This isn't an indicator of anything other than the most incel demographic on the planet</div></div><hr />

The kids crying bout wow just needed something new to cry about because 8.1 might leave them with less to bitch about, and the internet *fucking needs its hate boner*. <br />

Sure, the comment about them putting their &quot;best devs&quot; on mobile is pretty shitty and if that results in all of their games going to shit, then I'll be right there complaining.

<br />
First, if you noticed who you were replying to, you'd see that I wasn't the one laughing. Second, the interest in the west is more than likely going to be pretty low, but the west was never the intended market for Immortal. It's the eastern market, namely the Chinese, that they were going for. These kinds of games make ludicrous amounts of money over there, and Immortal is not likely to be any different. The major issue with this whole thing was that the made a strictly business decision to create this game, and chose to announce it to the market that they were aware had no interest in it. The presentation was for the investors and the shareholders, not the people at Blizzcon.</div></div><hr />

While I completely agree that these days wow doesn't have it's best community, I completely disagree on Diablo Immortal being fine. It's not even Blizzard's game, it's just a reskin of NetEase's Endless of God reskin. There is a very good article at Forbes describing what's wrong with Diablo Immortal without anything toxic and stuff like that - https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2018/11/06/the-5-biggest-problems-with-this-diablo-immortal-fiasco/#3f5d60bc145a</div></div><hr />

<br />
when i sold one echoing fury for 250€, i received 211,65€ (1€ transaction fee for paypal, 37,35€ transfer fee for blizzard i assume). that money wasn't one or two, no, it was nearly three months of game-time in wow.<br />
<br />
and i would reckon that a lot of 250€ items went over the table and god damn, i miss those days. only had two of those sales, the rest mostly 3-5€ an 10-35€ sales. but it was something to work and play for in the vanilla d3 days where inferno was hard. teamed up with my gf and had a few nice months running through zones and hoping for a legendary drop (without the gorgeous and nowadays inflationary used beams).<br />
<br />
i would even trudge through the current gem if i could earn money with it. so sad.</div></div><hr />

Yes it's a total embarassment to be a member of the community that grew up playing challenging games made by gamers for gamers instead of playing reskin chinese microtransaction low quality gameplay game. It's totally embarassing to attack the company for trying to make a quick buck by reskinning a chinese by-the-numbers game and demand that they do something with the franchise that didn't get a single worthy update since 2014 (unless you count 1 class OMEGALUL). <br />
<br />
The game will 99% be garbage because it doesn't have its heart in the right place. Because it's just a soulless reskin made to milk kids off their parent's creditcards. Because it's not a game that fans will sink their teeth into. Because mobile gaming sucks by default.</div></div><hr />

It 100% has to do with the time and place of the announcement. If Blizzard announced Diablo 4, even just a teaser, after the mobile game announcement then there would not be this shit storm. You have to understand this, right?</div></div><hr />

1.) PC audience expected PC game<br />
2.) It's false advertisment since its clearly a reskinned chinese game, same animations, same skillsets, same everything.<br />
3.) Idiots like you calling people &quot;kids&quot; for the lack of any intelligent argument<br />
4.) &quot;Gamer&quot;? Only people in &quot;gaming industry&quot; use the term gamer.</div></div><hr />

I some how doubt that, the only thing that would have saved Blizzard in that pit they dug with the mobile announcement would have been just that, Diablo 4, and nothing else, people would have laughed and said &quot;oh you!, blizzard&quot; if that had been, but alas they didnt, and here we are.</div></div><hr />

Actually, he have a point, not in the insulting, and you too have a point. <br />
<br />
Blizzard could have announce this game, and a tease about Diablo 4, like Bethesda did for ES mobile game and the next ES VI<br />
<br />
The game still will do good, and blizzard is right about trying to insert in the mobile market. But the core fan base need to be keep. So they need to try and fix the situation they jump into it. <br />
<br />
Still all the negative publicity they getting isnt a bad thing, CoD Infinity Warframe is a good example of that.</div></div><hr />

Every little glimpse of hope I see in the community is worth congratulating. You ARE right. <br />
People are over reacting so freaking much over this announcement that it feels like gamers nowadays are just keyboard warriors, plain and simple.<br />
<br />
I mean, look at the latest Fallout game. People whine and cry and complain about it because, I assume, Bethesday decided to go down another path than their original Fallout games. I see the same happening to Diablo right now. But no one seem to be able to reflect on ANYTHING else, like the fact that Blizzard made a post on their website pre-Blizzcon says that they are working on multiple Diablo project and their biggest one is not yet ready to be announced.<br />
<br />
My guess is that they only announced Immortal at BlizzCon so they at least had something to say, instead of having yet a second consecutive year with no Diablo panel. And to be fair... I'm glad they did. I'm also fine with the fact that they're trying to reach another audience. They are not ENTITLED to bring game contents exclusively for PC gamers.<br />
<br />
In the end, they're a great company, and just like any other company in the business, they will evolve and try new stuff, like it or not. In the end, we play THEIR games... as should be.<br />
<br />
I remember a time when I was excited to see what companies would bring us. Now... people are taking everything for granted to a point that they think they deserve to decide what should be or not, just because they're paying...<br />
Sad.</div></div><hr />

I dont understand why anyone has a problem with mobile games? How does this effect D4, which was all but announced months ago?<br />
<br />
I understand being like &quot;blizzcon sucked&quot; cuz the announcements sucked, but that doesnt mean this game is somehow garbage because of that, or shouldnt exist. It also doesnt mean blizzard is somehow failing or flopping. <br />
<br />
The kids crying bout wow just needed something new to cry about because 8.1 might leave them with less to bitch about, and the internet *fucking needs its hate boner*. <br />
<br />
Sure, the comment about them putting their &quot;best devs&quot; on mobile is pretty shitty and if that results in all of their games going to shit, then I'll be right there complaining. But all this entitled bullshit fake outrage is nauseating. So fucking embarrassed to be a gamer these days.<br />
<br />
A mobile game is fine yes. Np.<br />
<br />
The problem is how Blizzard decide to use their resources and what they present to their costumers.</div></div><hr />

It was a mid-expansion Blizzcon and most of the announcements were par to encouraging. Love to the WoW team realizing BfA is in a rut and they showed content that can jazz the fans. WCIII remaster ... *drools and hands over money*<br />
Hearthstone showed their usual humor and fun. <br />
Starcraft II... continues.. <br />
Even Overwatch and Heroes of the Storm, while not big, show creativity and ... also fun, if they are your games.<br />
<br />
Yes you will find outliers, but on the whole BLIZZCON was fine.<br />
<br />
Then.. Diablo mobile. The problem the FAN BASE has ... (and investors by the market reaction) ... is this game was not for them. <br />
<br />
(I use this analogy in discussions, and a better one has not popped up) watch Princess Bride. The scene where Humperdink tells Buttercup that the 'entire fleet' will celebrate their wedding, and she replies 'Except your four fastest [that were supposedly looking for Westley]?' Humperdink's reaction is EXACTLY the reaction Wyatt Chang and company had when they were asked if it was playable on PC... the features [like clear effects] would be ported to D3 ... a new character... ANYTHING. That reaction of 'oh... crap... we got caught.' D3 was not even on the radar of the LEAD DEVELOPERS. The PC was not a consideration. They had a full day of firefighting before their Q&amp;A panel the next day to come up with ANYTHING. Instead, they double down and cut the time back to sell their product to the wrong crowd and cut Q&amp;A as a thing.<br />
<br />
There is nothing wrong with mobile. Hell a D1/2 remaster on phone would be a blast. It was not this that people booed. It was the clear lack of care by the devs of the franchise's existing base.<br />
<br />
PS - even Blizz thought this was dumb back in the day with 'Happy Reaper' in 2014.</div></div><hr />
