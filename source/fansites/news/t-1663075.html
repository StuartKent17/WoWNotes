Classes<br />
Are any classes going to be reworked? or can we expect how skills and mechanics are now to be good for this expansion.<br />
It depends on what you mean by &quot;rework&quot; but you won't see complete overhauls mid-expansion for sure. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/543838814360576001))<br />

Something happened to our quest design team. Something bad. http://t.co/BewWfec2fN (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/543519756502847489))<br />
Didn't realize quest design team role-played thru quests. Makes me wonder about all those poop quests.<br />

Garrisons<br />
Is the perk for having a lvl 3 Inn supposed to give missions with such low XP rewards? If so how do we revert back to lvl 2?<br />
These missions don't take the place of any other missions, there's no downside to having them. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/543825704568123395))<br />
<br />
rerolled resto shaman and got Chain Lightning. Also disheartening to have spec not matter at all.<br />
Spec matters for 2 things: abils they can get, and their basic attack (e,g,healers do lower dmg, have a heal) (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/543937811888340992))<br />

<br />
there is no point of giving away TCG loot. the TCG vendor in game has been broken for over 7 months at least on StormScale in some US server has been broken for over 1 year and still going now.<br />
i gave to the GM my 5 codes that i couldn't get from the vendor cos i was keep getting –Invalid Code– message over 5 MONTH AGO..!! and still didn't get any reply from them.<br />
and here we have a TCG give away.. i guess u have to get on the line for those codes.<br />

You have to go to http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/misc/en/ put your code in there and then it should give you a code that you give to the vendor.</div></div><hr />
