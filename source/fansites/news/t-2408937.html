because you could literally level 110 to 118/119 in one leveling zone and people are using war mode for the extra xp so they can off set it. Its still faster to level in war mode, but they literally nerfed it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not harder. It takes longer.<br />
<br />
There is a major difference between time and difficulty. This is time consuming. Unless you run out of quests in a zone which is unlikely there is no difficulty or tedium to it.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Lumineus</div><div class="date">2018-07-05, 10:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">The leveling change is basically meaningless. You still have to do the main quest in all three zones for campaign completion which should give you more than enough XP to hit 120. By the time this is irrelevant, they'll have upgraded the heirlooms again.<br />
<br />
50% longer AP grind can DIAF, though. I thought BfA was supposed to be more alt friendly, Ion? Maybe you should change your name to Hamachi, so the has-he-cost-us jokes will flow better.</div></div><hr />

If you plan to play the expansion with something srsly you`ll end up doing all of the zones anyway. About the AP - atm the neck leveling is rly fast. My 355 azerite items req ~ 25-28 azerite level for the +5 item level, so mythic items will be 385 (no forging for em) and they`ll req ~ 42-45 probably. I got up to lvl 17 while leveling and doing a few dungeons, no WQ, no expeditions for extra AP, etc. Even if you are in a mythic guild and get such high il item on the 1st mythic week you`ll still have 3 weeks + to farm AP, more than enough. The neck levels really fast, every activity gives u AP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's no probably about it. This happens literally every single beta, XP is always tuned low to make it quicker to get people through for testing, and then towards the end it is retuned to reach the levels intended for the live game.</div></div><hr />

On Beta levelling through content that was new to me, and broken in places (preventing you from finishing lucrative questlines), was very quick. I'm not surprised it's gone up, because it felt more like 10 levels Pre-60 than the latest expansion.</div></div><hr />

I'll tell you one thing. That guy is awful on that show. Can't view anything from someone else's perspective or at the very least concede to anything as a courtesy to keep the show moving along.

I kept seeing this complaint in beta, but didn’t experience it myself. <br />

Im not sure, but wer already pretty deep into the beta.<br />
Maybe they already decreased the AP needed for a level up?<br />
Keep in mind raids are opened 2 weeks after the fresh release, with luck there will be one decrease of AP needed to level up.<br />
<br />
But im soooooo happy they dont increase AP gain anymore, so its worth to farm AP on week 1 instead of just waiting for the 10.000 AP numbers.<br />

You could easily hit 120 doing only 2 leveling zones and never touching the third one, and that was without War Mode. It had to be tuned some to make some sense with War Mode on.</div></div><hr />

IT IS BETA! Beta is beta. All content subject to change, and subject to testing.<br />

It was made &quot;faster on beta&quot; to accommodate testing. Just like how they make the Legendary Drop rate on the Diablo 3 PTR like 1000% higher. TESTING!<br />

Let's say you'll reach the end of first zone by level 119 on Beta, while you'll reach it at 113 on live. How do you know it is correctly balanced ? How do you know you don't get obliterated by random mobs, or you obliterate elite mobs ?<br />

No need for rage. Yes, most start at max level indeed. BUT, I understand why Blizz wants to make most experience more of the game. If they added a button with &quot;Boost to 120 intantly&quot;, many would. And then complain that they had nothing to do. A new expansion should be enjoyed, not rushed through. ;)</div></div><hr />

You can't.<br />
<br />
They increased it by 15%. meaning you will be at around 117-118ish where you were at 119, they also know you won't get &quot;obliterated&quot; by random mobs because they have this thing called &quot;scaling&quot; <br />

<br />
Scaling sucks hard for some contents, yes.<br />
<br />
Especially the max-level gap, which was always a nightmare in terms of scaling.<br />
<br />
PS : i'm not crying, nor complaining, just saying that Testing something in an environment that is not at all like what it will be in Live, is beyond stupid. They should have made this change on Beta weeks ago, to test the new conditions.<br />
Now they have tested the faster experience, it works fine, and they won't have time to test the real condition. How stupid is that.<br />
<br />
They want people to arrive quicker at max level ? Give them the opportunity to create a max level character or an option to increase experience by 300%.</div></div><hr />

Didn't meant to make it sound like rage. It is of course needed that the flow at which people reach 120 is controlled in a way that people don't start complaining about lack of content earlier than they want to release it. Although Legion did feel a bit over gated in this matter, and the whole AP thing at some point felt like those endless games where you level each time just to find out the next level costs you 10x more exp with minimal benefit. Hope the next thing won't be more of the same. In my eyes things should be more balanced in a way that you would never need a catch up mechanic or an &quot;instant 120&quot; button. But there ends up never existing such a balance. It's either grind till you make or your frustration makes you quit, or wait for the magic catch up buttons.</div></div><hr />

This. 1000000x this. Every time I think the WoW community has hit peak entitlement, they flip out about something that happens EVERY BETA (the increase of xp to level, because it was purposefully lower to get people further....you know, to TEST MORE?!) and act as though the sky is falling.<br />

The necklace was at almost 35 by the time it was time to go raid. That's high, for those not playing Beta.

Are you referring to some catchup mechanisms put in place? I haven’t logged into beta for at least a month. But, when I was playing the AP gains from WQ &amp; dungeons seemed pretty insignificant. Island expedition rewards &amp; warfronts weren’t fully implemented yet so there was a pretty clear path to burning out before launch.

<br />
I agree 100% here. I have all classes at 110 and started leveling some allied races... and the game is already trending towards way longer to level and gear alternate characters. More quest lines in the game need &quot;I heard this before...&quot; skip mechanics. Leveling is far slower with fewer skills at low levels and more xp required. The game doesn't feel any &quot;harder&quot;, just stretched out. I am afraid that BFA is going to kill my alts and push me into one char (or worse, away from WoW finally).</div></div><hr />
