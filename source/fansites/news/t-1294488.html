It's probably just something that allows people to block invites to private chat channels. Doesn't seem like anything big.<br />

PVP is too bursty right now with cleave comps like thug cleave. However, I'm not sure they have enough activity on PTR to determine how much they are changing PVP. I have a feeling this could slow down game play too much. Maybe making teams like god comp even better.</div></div><hr />

I'd wait till the PTR is back up to judge on this, seeing this is just the datamined stuff. If it still isn't labeled Release on the PTR itself, then I'll be disappointed too. Seems like it's about time to prepare for release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the last few builds have been completely non functional on mac. to call it a release without at least testing mac client when they FINALLY fix it (this build sapper has told us), would be bad. I bet if this build is finally working on mac they make next one release.</div></div><hr />

Honestly, while I don't really have to much hope for these changes working out, I am glad that are making huge wide sweeping changes to PvP, that means they are trying to fix it. Right now its so screwed up its simply unplayable.</div></div><hr />

Right...Because you guys never bitch about PvE players with legendary weapons until they get nerfed to the point where they may as well be epic quality with no procs...</div></div><hr />

If you can't handle a mage in pvp then you should maybe switch to pve.<br />

PvP power and PvP resilience on gear and gems will be so low that you might as well get double the amount of sockets and more primary stats from PvE gear. 65% base resilience is already more than what glas cannons are rocking today, imagine when they can rock even more damage without dropping anywhere close to the same amount of survivability as they do now.

It's funny people don't realize why the gems are getting nerfed. Because of the amount of sockets on PVE Gear it was more profitable to stack PVP gems on them.<br />
Now PVP stats on PVP gear will be favored more than extra gem slots.<br />

<br />
What the heck are you talking about? PvE gear will never be as good as PvP gear. Those gem slots you're referring to count against the item budget, so it balances out with the stats on PvP gear. It's just PvP gear saves you a bit more gold on gemming. Plus, only people who can't be ass'ed to research PvP Power's value will gem their main stat. 160 PvP Power is still way more valuable than 160 of a main stat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
160 int for instance was already 10% stronger for destro locks than 320 pvppower in pvp.<br />
Now with the pvppower nerf and the gem pvpstat nerf, 80 int will tripple the damage gain over 80 pvppower.<br />

Haven't seen anything about this being a release candidate, I wouldn't be looking for 5.3 to go live next week (7th/8th), though the week after that is possible (14th/15th) but I get the feeling it may end up being the 21st/22nd. *shrug* Guess it depends on whether Blizzard have any more changes they want to throw in there before 5.3 goes live.</div></div><hr />

No it is not. He obviously don't know what he is talking about...<br />
<br />
320 PVP power was allready in competition with 160 main stat for some class/spec. Now the choice will be obvious for the majority. It will just help to do a little PVe in PVP gear actually not that bad. But they still should just remove PVP power gem at all.</div></div><hr />
