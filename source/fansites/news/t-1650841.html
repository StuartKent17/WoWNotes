<br />
I'm perfectly fine with no flying. The only time it's been annoying is when I was exploring Gorgrond I got stuck multiple times and the only solution was to teleport away. Beware of the big steam hole things and the gaps between vines that only let you pass in one direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, I want to use the flying mounts that I have. I want to be able to make a stop if I see something interesting going on down below, instead of being stuck on a #$%$% flight path. At the beginning of xpacs, it is tolerable. But after a while...</div></div><hr />

IMO tie flying into the legendary ring quest. When you get the ring at the end of the xpac your mounts are able to fly</div></div><hr />

Nah, if they are going to be this way, they should just remove flying mounts. For the older xpac worlds, just replace them with vendors that you pay gold to rent gryphons/wind riders for a day.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I do hope that if they cave and put flying in the game it has actual gameplay interactions. Think how it worked in Skettis/Ogri'la before everyone cried and the kaliri got nerfed, but way better and more awesome. I would be all for that. But i don't know if the current implementation of how flying actually works would even allow for this, i think some serious reworking would be required in order to make flying as a mechanic not suck.<br />
<br />
Agree with that comment above about some of the unclimbable ramps and such. There have been some VERY frustrating moments where i can't run up what should be a simple to run up ledge because of the awkward collision. I always said that when they gave flying the chop in they should make it as easy to traverse as possible, and some of terrain is just frustrating as hell.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Many of us have been &quot;out there&quot; and seen everything, found all the treasures and killed all the rares etc.<br />
<br />
Unless they plan to add content across every part of every zone in Draenor each patch it will remain an inconvenience to not be able to fly. And even if they do add all that stuff it will be found fast and we will still be back to the &quot;been there, done that&quot; part that alot of us are at right now in no time.</div></div><hr />

Nagrand is *such* a pain in the rear to navigate, whomever designed that is slightly sadistic. There are also those holes that you can fall into with no way out. It's obvious they designed the place with flying in mind (much like Northrend. After they added flying the scale of the zones changed.), so it seems silly not to add it. Plus I feel like I can't see anything when I can't view it from the air, and I miss being able to point myself in a direction and kind of zone out on the way there.</div></div><hr />

But I fear that the grand majority of less committed casuals (well, that sounds weird) that just log in occasionally do want flying back, though, it's just not reflected on the poll, since MMO-Champion community is not exactly casual (may harbor casual players, but the mindset is, generally speaking, not casual). <br />
<br />
Still, I hope if flying is allowed again, it will be tied to a long quest chain, so that it actually feels like something big. I don't want to just pay for it, at least on my main.</div></div><hr />

lol There's also the fact that this poll is grossly inaccurate due to the fact that you can stuff the ballot box multiple times just by clicking your choice, clicking vote, then clicking return to poll.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Darkeon</div><div class="date">2014-12-06, 07:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Totally fine with no flying at the start of each expansion, be it until reaching level cap or even a following patch; However having no flying at all during the entire expansion is going to be rough. <br />
<br />
For now it's all nice and dandy since the expansion is new and everyone is out doing something they actually enjoy.. but once the novelty wears off and people simply want to rush the inconvenience and go straight to the profit; That's when it'll sting!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really? I've heard the opposite from everyone. In fact, this is the best storyline for an expac since WotLK. Cata was a mess and don't get me started on Pandaria. No one gave a shit about helping some elitist panda people with their moogoo problems. Lei Shen may have been a cool encounter, but no one talks about how epic it was to finally down the moogoo king because no one cares. This is Warcraft at it's finest. Orcs v Humans v Demons. I'm loving it.<br />
<br />
But in regards to no flying? I am SHOCKED that Blizzard has said they have no plans to add flying in 6.1. I really am. I thought they would cave for sure. This is a polarizing topic, but it seems most people do enjoy not having flying in. I personally couldn't have given a shit at first if it was in or not, but after playing without it I'm pretty happy. I feel like the world is alive again. I see people. I see people dying constantly to bad terrain moves in Shattrath or The Pit. The danger is real again. Can't just fly from one part to the other ignoring the world below you. Blizz can let people fly in Draenor when the next expansion is out.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrakeWurrum</div><div class="date">2014-12-06, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What they should have done was allow us to unlock flying on a zone by zone basis. When we get the achieve for a zone storyline we are granted the ability to fly in that zone.<br />
<br />
Then Blizz can continue to design quests the way they want and we still get to fly without making quests so stupidly pointless.</div></div><hr />

I'm not going to disagree - but there's currently just about as many anti-flight threads created opening with insults than there are pro-flight threads at the moment.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it looks like they fixed the poll so you can only vote once per IP, but the current votes should really be reset too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Coffeh</div><div class="date">2014-12-06, 07:48 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not a great poll question. Of course people don't mind not flying while questing. That's how it's always been (except Cata). However, there is no reason to not have it at 100. No legitimate reason, anyway.<br />
<br />
So all Blizzard should do is force players to get the 'Loremaster of Draenor' achievement...meaning they have to do all the quests first, and then you can get flying in Draenor. Very simple and effective. That would get me to resub and buy the expansion.<br />
<br />
<br />
What a completely pointless poll. People without subscriptions vote so it isn't representative of the player base, and you can vote more than once.<br />
Actually, a poll here is much more accurate than one on the official WoW forums. For the very reason you mentioned: there only people with active subs can vote. So obviously anyone (like me) not playing because there's no flying can't vote. However, the poll question is flawed anyway...for reason above.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rudypoo</div><div class="date">2014-12-06, 07:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am actually enjoying the xpac without flying right now. If the fp's are given more direct flights (which is apparently on the agenda for 6.1), I may enjoy it further still.<br />
<br />
Having said the above, I will say that Aviana's Feather has made my enjoyment of this xpac much better. Without it, I probably wouldn't be half as pleased with everything. Popping that and getting from the fp at the top of a spire in Shattrath to the questing areas below is a prime example of why I still think flying should be included at some point. You cover more ground, which means it's easier to clear long distances (the fp between the garrison and Spires of Arak is brutal if you're counting minutes). Also, seeing the landscape from the air is a joy all its own. All it does is give a new perspective from which to take in the terrain and architecture of this xpac.</div></div><hr />

The story is pretty boring too, you could write the synopsis on the back of a beer mat. Maybe there will be some twists but so far it's just dull. The cut scenes just seem unbelievably cheesy.</div></div><hr />

Some of us always saw flying as a mistake. We just didn't cry and rage quit like children. The way I see it if flying or not flying is enough for you to not enjoy the game you probably need to move on anyway.</div></div><hr />

If you want to fly: just buy a flight simulator but stay out of a massive on line ROLE PLAYING ADVENTURE game.<br />
<br />
I would include flying in the last 3 months of WoD. The world of Dranei today is Much too important to trivialise it.</div></div><hr />

I've seen a ton of people say that they unsubbed in MoP after the announcement of no flying, so it seems that being able to vote on this poll would tip the scales in favor of those who quit because of no flight. Funny that.</div></div><hr />

WotLK had NO flying while leveling at launch. Only at lvl 80 you would have access to it BUT the world was trivialised after that and everyone complained there was NO ONE in the open world back then.<br />
<br />
Besides WoD is the best expansion yet to level. Everyone agrees on that.<br />
<br />
New mechanics, better game experience. Everyone is back ADVENTURING in the world again. This is an open world role playing adventure game not a personal flight simulator that avoids the adventure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I enjoyed leveling with no flying, the questing experience and the way I was led was fantastic.<br />
<br />
As soon as I dinged 100 though, I have no need to quest, I have no need to be led certain directions, I have no need to be restricted on where I can travel.<br />
I want the choice to be able to fly to all the spawn points of the 72 hour rares, fly to a particular point on the map just because. Draenor is a big place, and running everywhere is not feasible.<br />

I voted no on this as I want flying back, but the answer to the specific question you asked is yes, I am enjoying it, while leveling alts.<br />

I think WotLK did it best - flying was hard to get at the beginning of the expansion, and became easier to get towards the end. MoP screwed up in that respect, and it looks like WoD is going further in the wrong direction.</div></div><hr />

No, everybody who voted no should just have their flying skills permanently deleted. Then they can *truly* enjoy never flying, and be *hard core*. <br />

I guess nobody else remembers how much fun it was to fly, or maybe nobody else thought it was. I thought it was awesome. I loved leveling in cata. The only people who suffered were the griefers. And for every design choice they had to make because players could fly, there was a new opportunity BECAUSE PLAYERS COULD FLY. The flying derelict ship in Deepholm was the merest scratch on the surface, they could have done so much more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because everything worth doing happens on the ground. Quests, achievements, pet-battles, node-gathering, creature presence, environmental presence. Flying trivializes all of that. Getting from A to B, faster and convenient. However, you remove yourself from the world.<br />
<br />
Now you might say: &quot;creature presence, environmental presence - Is just tedious and boring, and not challenging, and not for any late gamer&quot;. However, this is an adventurous world, where stuff actually happens on the ground. Nothing happens in the air, there is no presence of anything whatsoever. BNot being able to look down on the hill from a 90 degree angle serves no purpose, as to what it does to the game. Which is to remove yourself from the actual world. <br />
<br />
Blizzard should just remove any &lt; level 99 creature from the zones. Hell, why not just make make the world flat? Everything is just tedious and boring. Doesn't matter if its PvE or PvP server. Being able to fly removes you from the world. Single player in a multi player game.</div></div><hr />

Unless they plan to add content across every part of every zone in Draenor each patch it will remain an inconvenience to not be able to fly. And even if they do add all that stuff it will be found fast and we will still be back to the &quot;been there, done that&quot; part that alot of us are at right now in no time.<br />
<br />
So what? Allowing flying is a very temporary fix to your been there/done that problem and permanently alters the game play for plenty of other players who don't share it. Go find something else to do if you're that bored.</div></div><hr />

So what? What does it matter if people without subscriptions can vote? Or if you can vote more than once? One side isn't going to be able to take advantage of that fact more than the other. I take it you're sad because you can't fly and want to pretend that the majority of people want to fly without proof to back it up.<br />

Also no one said the polls was 100% representative of every member of the playerbase. But it is telling that so many don't miss flying =)<br />

I'm with you, No matter how long I do it I just can't enjoy ground mounts. I bought the grinning reaver the day it came out (don't remember when that was) but I didn't use it in a flyable area until yesterday. Was pretty sweet :D. I'm almost certain they will add flying though, even if it's the last week of the expansion.<br />

Nah, if they are going to be this way, they should just remove flying mounts. For the older xpac worlds, just replace them with vendors that you pay gold to rent gryphons/wind riders for a day.<br />

You know I want flying but the whole &quot;we may or may not&quot; standpoint is more annoying. Remove it from the entire game or have it everywhere in the game.</div></div><hr />

That I'm stuck in one place (garrison) until I have to go to another zone to complete something e.g. Daily, farming animals for barn, stable dailies, raid usually due to it taking forever or being extremely costly to go anywhere. I mean it's already costing 20-30g to go Nagrand or Iron Docks in Gorgond or even to fly to any point from Stormshield using the flight paths it just makes me think I'd rather dump 5k on flying and be done with it. Plus it'd allowed me to go out and visit remote locations more as I've also got pretty much all of the rares and treasures already (except for the BS stuck in the tree ones in Nagrand) and I've fully explored each zone apart from Frostfire. Also honestly if anyone try's to make the argument that a Pit group is a good reason not to have flying on Draenor I feel sorry for you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I play on a high pop server, the same one during MoP, during MoP I could not go more then 3 seconds without seeing people all over, in WoD the only time I saw people was when I was leveling to 100 and here and there when I needed go leave my garrison (which is rare)...how is that possible? I thought flying caused people to not go out in the world and no flying caused people to go out in the world?<br />
<br />
What does that mean? a few things, garrisons are a big factor, there is dick to do at max level that puts you out in the world especially since Blizzard thought it was a good idea to go from 3523589235 dailies in MoP down to about ~2 in WoD<br />
<br />
And Blizzards reasoning about wanting people to experience/see the world they made, yeah that is cool and all the first time around, but at the same time I do not give a rats ass about how long it took them to detail that generic mountain that exists in every other zone in the game, I don't care how long it took Blizzard to make that building over there, I don't care how much planning went into making a zone and honestly a good percent of the generic crap out in new zones already existed in the game so I've already seen it<br />
<br />
No flying was surely dreamed up by the same crowd of douches who constantly whine about how they want vanilla servers back, when everyone knows 99% of them would be limping back to live servers within a week once they realize it isn't as fun as they remember<br />
<br />
Flying was in past expansions (or became available at max level) and it seemed just fine, I saw people but I'm having a hard time finding anyone now</div></div><hr />

But then, we flew in every single patch, and with cata ( correct me if i am wrong) we were able to fly everywhere. <br />
<br />
Now, we are unable to fly again, the game is completly changed, the game mechanics are changed as well. I like to being able to fly in this map. It reminds me the &quot;kargath&quot; meeting point before the raids. it reminds me the hardness of the material farming. And no fly zone makes us enjoy the map in my opinion, i like the map design. i really dont want to see flying coming with the 6.1 patch.</div></div><hr />

Love no flying. Hope it stays this way. Questing may be (nearly) done, but there are lots of rares, treasures, rep grinds, farming, trapping, and pure exploration to be found. <br />

That being said, flying WILL come to Draenor. Probably when 7.0 hits.</div></div><hr />

Yeah its a lazy way of doing it, but maybe thats how i enjoy it? Whats the problem with implementing flying mounts, if you wanna use ground mounts and still enjoy it - feel free! Nobody is stopping you run everywhere and enjoy yourself in the meanwhile :D They havent implemented any flight-only stuff in the game so you wont be missing out on anything, and us flying mount users wont be in any situation of gaining anything.<br />
Dont want flight enabled on new characters to the zone, but maybe do a sort of garrison-related quest or something for the max levels.</div></div><hr />

This. I'd also like to see a poll where you were only allowed to vote once. You could easily cast 20 votes for your choice in a minute if you wanted with the way this poll is designed.<br />
<br />
The problem with no flying at this point in the game is a lot more simple. Being able to fly in no way provides me with any type of gameplay advantage over people who aren't flying. All it does is allow me to complete what im doing in game faster than someone on the ground. I personally could careless about the &quot;epic&quot; feeling of taking 2-3 times as long to do something as I could on a flying mount. IDC about the scenery or whatever other excuse you wanna use to justify no flying. You play the game for your reasons and how you choose I play for my reasons. If flying somehow provided me with a gameplay advantage or allowed me access to better gear or something then yes I could see no flying. But all it does is provide convenience.<br />
<br />
The other problem I have with no flying is that I am being forced to not use flying. Players who enjoy playing on ground mounts have always had the choice to do so. They were never told hey you cant travel on the ground or by foot you HAVE to fly. They made that choice when they mounted up. I have no choice.</div></div><hr />

If you bring flying into Draenor, you remove the visualization of everything you've created.<br />
The passion for the game is finally here again, TBC times more or less, you could only fly in Outlands, cause you had to to reach instances.<br />

<br />
There is some truth to this statement. Now one of the primary arguments in favor of no flying is that ground mounts allow the player to see the world in a more immersive manner (which is silly, it's the same as seeing it from the sky, just from a different perspective; you'll see the same tree whether you're on the ground or in the air, you'll just see the 50 other trees surrounding it from the sky in a way you never could on the ground). However, how much time do you really spend on the ground?<br />
<br />
When I travel anywhere, 90% of the time I jump on a fp. If I need to go to Spires of Arak, I jump on the fp. If I need to go to Nagrand, I jump on the fp, and so on. So essentially I am already spending a great deal of my game time in the air -- the only difference is, I'm not the one controlling the journey. <br />
<br />
The expansion, itself, does its best to limit contact with a great deal of players out in the world, because it basically turns /afk in a major city to /afk in your garrison. In your garrison you have access to all the channels, including the city channel, you have LFR/LFG, plus the new group finder OC-like system, queuing up missions, work orders, bank, etc. -- and the cherry on top, you have a portal directly to the most visited hub in the game right now. <br />
<br />
There is almost no reason to leave your garrison other than camping world bosses, doing a fast group for your daily apexis crystals or questing from 90-100 -- so the reasoning behind flying ruining the game is a bit hollow. At cap, you'll barely ever engage in that content that you left behind in other zones unless there isn't much else to do, or you need to grab a follower you didn't get. Also, if Blizzard was so concerned about people circumventing their ground content, why did they add a feather in the game that lets you fly over half a zone? <br />
<br />
The best compromise, it seems, would be to do what they did with flying in TBC: make you wait until cap and have it cost a sizable amount of gold to purchase. <br />
<br />
The ground game seems tailor made for levelers. I can understand why being grounded from 90-100 makes sense. That is all about ground content. You're not focused on getting to farming locations so much as you're questing and picking up the nodes you find; you're not looking to get to a single objective, you have a handful of objectives that are all bunched up in the same area. It's a different game, therefore there should be different methods of approaching the content.<br />
<br />
As I said in the first paragraph, we're already spending a great deal of our game time in the air -- we're just sitting on a slow flight path, probably minimizing the game and listening to music, or leaving the keyboard to get a snack. With flying, you are getting the same experience of moving from point a to b, you're just also taking in the sights around you. You're picking up nodes you see along the way, or getting a rare kill that is half dead as opposed to seeing it from the air and knowing you won't have the time to ride back to it once you land. <br />
<br />
Leveling and cap have always been two different games. There is no way around that. It's just how the game was built. Your needs as you level will rarely sync up with your needs once you're at cap and on your 3rd+ alt; flying just allows the capped player more freedom to focus on the aspects they are more likely to engage in that are different from the leveler (instead of grouping up quests, you're just wandering around finding materials to farm -- so there is no reason why a capped player would care about going through a field of mobs that will serve no function other than wasting time -- they're already level capped, they don't need the experience, the gold is negligible, and it just makes an already time consuming task a little more tedious).</div></div><hr />

Blizzard just needs to tell people who want flying to build Goblin/Gnome Workshop and/or Inn at their Garrison.<br />

They already suggested many times that there will be flying near the end of the expansion's life cycle. This expansion just wasn't designed around flying.<br />

I understand some people don't like flying for various reasons and I can respect that. I don't mind no flying during leveling and I expected it. I patiently waited for Blizzard to say something solid about whether it would be in 6.1 or not. With the recent announcement that it wont be it's a no-go for me. It's time for a break from WoW.

Or you know....maybe people really just enjoy no flying. I know...that's hard to fathom isn't it. How much is it going to take for the pro flying crowd to just accept that people actually like not flying. I keep seeing people pull all sorts of BS out of their ass every time any shred of evidence comes out that proves people like being grounded.<br />
<br />
That said. Do I hate flying? No. Am I glad it's gone though? Yes. The way flying in WoW is is just too powerful. It invalidates 90% of the overworld game. It also makes devs lazy when they build a world with flying in mind. Why worry about making paths when everyone will just fly over them?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, no, you needed level 77. Initially they planned to implement it through a Sholazar Basin quest, but scrapped that idea. Flying delayed me levelling to 80 by a fair number of hours as I flew around enjoying the scenery and mining shit loads of Saronite, while nobody else could fly.<br />

I was already at a point where I had quit WoW and I came back for WoD.

There's a similar polls with near exact same results that says &quot;Do you miss flying?&quot;<br />
<br />
The poll is fine.<br />
<br />
We get it, &quot;The poll results don't agree with my opinion!&quot; means everyone is going to come up with some excuse for why the poll isn't valid.<br />

<br />
1) MMO champion represents a tiny portion of WoW playerbase. If I went by what MMO thought then MOP was a smash hit instead of a colossal failure<br />
2) The poll was phrased improperly. In order to get a better gauge of support for flying it was better to have asked &quot;do you support no flying throughout WoD and potentially future expansions?&quot; and see what the outcome would be<br />
3)Even among MMO champion's community 30%+disapproal(as of now) is a significant number of people.<br />
<br />
1) MMOC polls showed more people disliking pandaland than not. Tons of panda haters here. It also wasn't a colossal failure, as it sold more copies than and saw a lower number of lost subs than Cataclysm, which more people claimed to like.<br />
2) Similar polls on the forums have been worded in ways like &quot;Do you miss flying?&quot; with similar results. I figure &quot;do you miss flying&quot; is proper enough wording to indicate who would want flying back. Still about 68% of people don't miss flying on that poll.<br />
3) And a 70% disapproval would be even worse, what's your point?<br />

This. I'd also like to see a poll where you were only allowed to vote once. You could easily cast 20 votes for your choice in a minute if you wanted with the way this poll is designed.<br />
<br />
Either side could vote multiple times. Which do you think has more incentive to try and rig the vote, someone who wants to see something changed or someone who is content with the decisions Blizzard has made and is happily playing the game?</div></div><hr />

The problem with no flying at this point in the game is a lot more simple. Being able to fly in no way provides me with any type of gameplay advantage over people who aren't flying. All it does is allow me to complete what im doing in game faster than someone on the ground. I personally could careless about the &quot;epic&quot; feeling of taking 2-3 times as long to do something as I could on a flying mount. IDC about the scenery or whatever other excuse you wanna use to justify no flying. You play the game for your reasons and how you choose I play for my reasons. If flying somehow provided me with a gameplay advantage or allowed me access to better gear or something then yes I could see no flying. But all it does is provide convenience.<br />
<br />
The other problem I have with no flying is that I am being forced to not use flying. Players who enjoy playing on ground mounts have always had the choice to do so. They were never told hey you cant travel on the ground or by foot you HAVE to fly. They made that choice when they mounted up. I have no choice.<br />
<br />

<br />
People like no-flying because it makes the world feel bigger and makes getting to certain objectives ( rare spawns, chests, quest objectives) meaningful gameplay. Flight paths, and the items you mentioned to not allow you to easily land at a precise objective.<br />
<br />
Not really. I think the world feels far smaller; I don't ever travel from one zone to another under my own power, because that would take longer and have little point, so where Pandaria felt like a continent (one whose layout and landmarks I got to know over the course of the expansion by flying around it), Draenor feels like a bunch of zones that happen to be linked thematically. Intellectually I know that Nagrand and the Spires of Arak are adjacent, but in terms of immersion? I've never once had cause to ride from one zone to the other. Even the game encouranges you not to go from one zone to another directly, but instead sends you back to your garrison and gives you a flight path to the new zone... overall, Draenor has been fun, but it doesn't feel like a cohesive whole. Ashran is in the middle of nowhere on the map, but in practicality it might as well be placed in the middle of the continent; we flight path everywhere, so who would notice? <br />
<br />
Getting to certain objectives could easily be meaningful with flight. It would take a slight change in design, but not one that would be so huge as to make it impossible... and if the objection to flight is &quot;it allows you to trivialize or bypass mechanics&quot;, those other items do exactly the same thing, so if flight is objectionable for that reason, the other items should be as well. That the other items are not demonstrates that this is a false argument against flight. In fact, including treasures that require the gliders feels more like a cop-out than meaningful gameplay... &quot;here, have this puzzle that's absurdly easy either way, but takes 10 times longer this way because we make you run back up the mountain for each treasure you wish to obtain&quot;. <br />
<br />
(And if you're about to bring up CD, keep in mind that my primary position is that the removal of flight did not increase challenge, gameplay, or immersion, simply time; having CDs on the ability to bypass mechanics while still allowing them to be bypassed is a perfect example of that.) <br />
<br />
Also, if you can't use Avianna's feather to land precisely at your objective, that's your problem, not the feather's; I've had no similar difficulties :-P<br />
<br />
<br />
I get that many people are happy that flight was removed. What I don't get is how such people continually present subjective opinions as objective facts. Immersion is subjective, perception of world size is subjective... choosing to say that using flying mounts to bypass challenges trivializes the game, but using any of the numerous new Draenore mechancis to do exactly the same thing a bit slower is fine is either subjective or selective logic at its worst... <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The worst part? We spend so much time in garrisons and dungeons that at the end of the day, I'm not sure it matters, because I don't think most people do enough travel in the world for it to matter either way. The only reason I do is because I'm doing Draenor pet dailies most days, and the removal of flying mounts means that process is about 12 minutes of battles, about 12 minutes of flight path, and about 6 minutes of riding around ignoring anything I ride past because it's completely irrelevant and trivial. Not really any more immersive than using a flying mount to go where I want to go, but be able to stop along the way.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zackeria</div><div class="date">2014-12-06, 09:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was ok with the idea of no flying, if Blizzard did what they said they were going to do. They said they would put plenty of travel options in the game so that we wouldn't even notice we were missing flying. They said they would make it pleasant to get around on our ground mounts while out in the zones. Failure on both accounts. I see a number of flight paths comparable to most other zones (Cataclysm updated at least). There are a few portals and things of that nature here and there, but nothing that makes up for a lack of flying, especially in places like eastern Nagrand, most of Gorgrond, and southern Spires of Arak. There are a few more options IF you take the Spirit Lodge, but that would be only 3 more (at level 100). Taking the stables so that I can have faster ground mount speed at level 3 (which many people are likely doing) sounds like it would help, but has just made things worse with all the travel to the annoying parts of Nagrand repeatedly.<br />
<br />
And quite frankly, I still don't see why we don't have it. You want us to not have it while leveling up? I'm actually perfectly fine with that. I like going through the story on my main, and I don't want to skip/miss anything. I did get to level 100 long before Nagrand, having done all the quest in every zone on my main before moving on to the next zone in the storyline. You want us to get loremaster in every zone or at least get through the quests to watch the ending cinematic in every zone before flying? I'm actually perfectly fine with that. There are quite a few treasures and some rare monsters that would be far too simple to get/get to with the ability to fly to be worthy of an achievement. You want us to get the highest treasure hunter achievement and have killed most of the rares before being able to fly? Fine. Put all the hurdles in that you want so that we earn the ability to fly that people--especially casual players--worked very hard to get, having paid 10-15k gold to get and/or doing all of the world event achievements (including that damned Children's Week pvp achievement). But why is the hurdle 6.1 (and that better as hell be at least when the hurdle appears, if not the hurdle itself)? I've heard your reasons, and I don't buy them having played through the expansion thus far...</div></div><hr />

Of course Mop was not a failure(lol!), you just confirmed what I was writing about. Class in session:<br />
<br />
http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/4526-WoW-Up-to-10-Million-Subscribers-Garrison-Campaign-Quests-Active-Nov-19-Hotfixes<br />
<br />
One of the ways to compare an expansion is to compare where it began vs its lowest point For cata it was 12 million vs 9.1 million loss of 2.9 million for MoP it was 10 million vs 6.8 million loss of 3.2 million. But that masks the best argument. MoP was responsible for the quickest/harshest drop of subscriptions in WoW history December of 2012 9.6 million to Mar 2013 8.3 Million loss of 1.3 million subscribers in a span of 3 months. Cataclysm lost a lot towards the end of its lifecycle (even while buoyed by SoR and annual pass it dropped by 1.1 million between december 2011 and july 2012) but there is a difference between subscriptions dropping after dragon soul was over with vs early in the expansion cycle. 1.3 million people collectively said &quot;lolpanda&quot; and got out of MOP when it was new and it then plateaued before dropping further later.<br />
<br />
So yes, MOP was a colossal failure.<br />
<br />
Restriction of flying really has nothing to do with flight at all. It is about blizzard masking giving ever less content and squeezing ever more money out of its customers. Pet store got integrated into the game client, there are more and more pets and mounts for sale at an increasing rate. We are forced to waste more and more time on mobile phone kind of gameplay. When you are trying to stretch content onto months and months you have to slow players down which is what they are doing. Professions are artificially gated. A lot of people did not like timeless isle and did not want the whole expansion to be like timeless isle. What we have is what happens when business suits dictate the product and in Blizzard's case it is Kotick.</div></div><hr />

More like if you're in the 30% just stay in pre-Warlords places and using your flying mounts.<br />
<br />
But in all seriousness, you can't just say &quot;don't use them&quot;, people are forced to use them if others are.<br />
You can't possibly compete for gathering nodes, rares, mob tags, quest items, world pvp, etc if you're on a ground mount and people are whizzing around at 310% speed.<br />

I burn through a lot of herbs across my alts, and the spirits for extra daily-limited crafting reagents are very nice.<br />
<br />
Yes, there is competition for rares, because anyone in halfway decent gear can drop a rare in under 10 seconds. so if you're trying to run up a path to the top of a mountain for a rare and someone is on a flying mount... Or if you're on one side of The Pit when someone says &quot;X rare is up&quot;...<br />
<br />
And again, shared means you get there in time, and there are many that aren't shared at all. Take any bonus objective for example. Enjoy completing the burial fields if someone else is on a flying mount to get the tags on void priestesses. I &quot;steal&quot; quest mob tags constantly on my rogue because I can skip past trash and kill named mobs before other people can make it there. <br />
<br />
No one said world pvp was killed by flying. Please do not drag in arguments I didn't make.<br />
Flying absolutely changes how world pvp works. When you can fly at 310%, you can circle zones in 30-60 seconds, find flagged targets and swoop down on them with no warning for a kill. You can res, mount up and be completely out of attack danger within a few seconds.<br />
<br />

You can't do that on a ground mount.<br />
<br />
And if they are on a flying mount, so are you, so the rate that you can get to the herb is no faster than what &lt;x&gt; other person can. You aren't losing anything<br />
<br />
So a rare can die in under 10 seconds. They also respawn very quickly. Not much competition for something that respawns fast. And I don't know many rares that aren't shared. I'd imagine that list to be small. Even so, &quot;decent gear&quot; is easily better in Dungeons, where most 100s will be, and even now heroics are already a joke, so looking for rares for decent gear? ya..sure<br />
<br />
Bonus Objectives? Again, most of the rewards from that is the big bonus to XP and gold. And there are what, maybe 20-25 in the expansion? Most people that are looking to complete those are leveling, and if they are leveling, will be those not flying. <br />
<br />
WPvP is such a small portion that it isn't really worth making a big change over. Most PvP happens in BGs.</div></div><hr />

The point of my post was that &quot;If you don't like flying mounts, don't use them&quot; isn't a valid argument for why Blizzard should appeal to the minority of players that aren't enjoying no-flying.

Thing is the 30% or whatever unhappy are paying customers also make them happy the other 70% who dont like it dont have to use it.. If you are the 70% just dont mount a flyer simple..<br />

my argument wasn't specifically about that, or I would have mentioned it. but hey, whatever floats your boat. But if your defense to anything i say is that it isn't referring to that one piece of argument?

And I explained in detail why it was not, to which you made an unrelated argument. I.e.<br />
<br />
<br />
And if they are on a flying mount, so are you, so the rate that you can get to the herb is no faster than what &lt;x&gt; other person can. You aren't losing anything<br />
<br />
<br />
And then you proceeded to argue that my points were invalid because most pvp is in BGs and good gear comes from dungeons, which is a completely nonsensical line of logic because if you're spending most of your time in dungeons and BGs you aren't using a flying mount anyway, so it still makes absolutely zero sense to appeal to the minority who are unhappy with the current no-flying.</div></div><hr />

Flight paths are incredibly fast, and each character takes a max of 10 minutes to gather all of their garrison stuff and send followers out on missions. I don't need to farm because my garrison provides me with all that mats I'll ever need. I have to wonder what exactly it is you're doing that's being delayed in any significant way by not having flight.<br />
<br />
Archaeology is the one thing I can think of and it's already a time sink and with the flight points being incredibly fast, the only more time consuming part is the actual gathering of artifacts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You get a ton more digs per digsite in Draenor, so the developers have also made Archaeology more convenient in the absence of flight. I leveled my Archy much faster to 700 than I did in Pandaria to 600 with flight.</div></div><hr />

It's almost as if the positives of not being given the &quot;choice&quot; to disconnect from the world outweighs the negatives.<br />
<br />
I can understand the frustration of course. No matter what Blizzard does, loss of 310% speed will be felt as a nerf. Of course, very few consider that if flight is re-added, they'd also nerf node spawns, artifacts per digsite, and so on to compensate for such a surge in efficiency. Draenor is designed for our current personal travel capabilities. You try to compare alternatives of which one doesn't even exist. You take your current efficiency then think adding flight will double that. It wouldn't.<br />
<br />
Regarding the polls binary answers, it's pretty clear why. Whenever there's a &quot;Don't care&quot; option, those are somehow lumped together with the 20-30% voting for [whatever side I wish to argue for].<br />
But now we have clear-cut Yes or No. Two-thirds are positive to the change. Many are of course indifferent but still see the positives enough to vote positively.<br />
32% vote No, which is a bit unfortunate but don't try to argue that these are going to unsub over it. It's like quitting the game because your class gets a nerf. It's annoying but not that big of a deal.<br />
<br />
Annoyingly enough, the sub losses next quarter as many of those of the 2 million re-subbers (yikes!) won't really feel the urge to become stable subscribers again. They quit for a plethora of reasons, but a common trait is that they were tired of WoW, or the SoO content-drought at least. We're dropping at least a million and it'll probably take two seconds before that is readily repeated in the large no-flight thread.<br />

Bare-boned you're saying essentially nothing but &quot;I want my mats and ignore everything else.&quot;<br />
Like a chameleon with one eye locked on the minimap, caring about nothing but yellow blips. Atleast that's how I'd summarize when I farmed herbs in Sholazar on my druid. Only time my brain came out of this disconnected coma was when a node actually had a mob near it.<br />
<br />
Can it be frustrating when a node is on a ledge you just can't reach? Of course. Saying anything else would be dishonest.<br />
But you know what no-flight does, and was meant to accomplish from the very beginning? It's when your first reaction to this is &quot;Hm, how do I get up there...&quot; and start looking for the right path, instead of &quot;grhgrghrgr if i had flying id have it in .1 sec fehgfemdw..&quot;</div></div><hr />

The world is much more fun without flying. Gathering professions shouldn't be a minimap minigame with no interaction with the world. If you think you're having to spend too much time gathering resources, ask Blizzard for more nodes and your problems will be solved without the addition of flying.<br />
<br />
If flying would be added, all the negative aspects of flying would be added to WoD. It was never fun to have gankers land on top of you in outdoor PvP. Farming mats with a flying mount was also really boring.<br />
<br />
And finally: WoD has been received with incredible enthusiasm. So many people I know have started playing once more! Much more than with any previous expansion! So... all in all WoD delivers in its current state. No need to change up things in a drastic way.</div></div><hr />

Removing flying altogether, remember.. they were dragging people into their shop to buy all these flyers. That's as of now over $200.00 worth of mounts from the store. All these buyers could argue, how they've never spent a dime if it wasn't for flying use.<br />

So you want to go places more quickly. They're making flight paths a bit faster in 6.1 and there are so many of those. I find that traveling even the longest possible distances goes incredibly fast. It's easy to ask for flying back, but that'd introduce a lot of other problems. Instead, it'd be better to focus on what exactly your issues are and what other means we have to solve those.<br />
<br />
- Not enough mats? Maybe we can get a rank 4 for some buildings in our Garrison.<br />
- Not going places fast enough? Faster flight paths. Maybe a costly upgrade to make ground mounts faster.<br />
- Not being able to reach some places? More cool items like Aviana's Feather.<br />
<br />
Imo those solutions are way better than re-introducing flight.</div></div><hr />

But it still would be nice to be able to get around a little easier...there are paths but it's mostly off-roading at the moment - though, as long as you have the stable in your garrison, at least you don't get stunned and knocked off anymore. That's a bonus...<br />
<br />
Who knows? Maybe there will be a level 4 garrison upgrade in some future patch, and level 4 stables might allow it. That would suck, though, because then you'd have to have stables on all characters, but at least if you were happy to go without flying, you could, and I think that's part of what Blizz wants, for not everyone to get around so easily.</div></div><hr />

For example, we go to take Shattrath back from the Burning legion, then an hour or so later the area has been purged of the legion and it becomes some neat little hub, a few hours later a massive amount of iron horde come from the sea and lay siege to Shattrath therefore pushing us back to another area to get some resources again to take Shattrath back. This is only an example but I feel like if you make it something where you can get rewards that will keep people interested (since bribing is clearly the only answer) that it will make land mounts more enjoyable.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That wouldn't be a solution that's great for everyone though. A lot of people also like that fact that nobody has flying. World PvP (and doing anything outdoors on a PvP server) is terrible when there's flying. There's nothing more depressing than having an enemy drop onto your head from the sky to pound you to death. And corpse camping is terribly convenient with flying mounts.<br />

It'd be cooler if they solved these issues through other means and would bring back flying in a much more restricted form. Maybe just in specific parts of the world or maybe with some kind of PvP penalty after you dismount. Maybe with a hefty cooldown.</div></div><hr />

A lot of people also like that fact that nobody has flying. World PvP (and doing anything outdoors on a PvP server) is terrible when there's flying. There's nothing more depressing than having an enemy drop onto your head from the sky to pound you to death. And corpse camping is terribly convenient with flying mounts.<br />

Actually, corpse camping is a lot harder to do with flying mounts. All you have to do as the one being griefed is find a little groove in the landscape to rez behind, quickly mount up and you're out of danger. <br />
<br />
If anything, flight makes ganking harder to do, not easier.<br />

<br />
I enjoy the expansion, though I still want flying back at some point. <br />
<br />
The content, itself, is interesting -- though Blizzard's reason for omitting flight is downright laughable. If flight was really something detrimental to their content, why would they include feathers that let you glide half a zone, or gliders? Also, why would they allow you to basically camp in your garrison and never leave? I barely have to leave the confines of my garrison for any reason. My bank is there. My Tannery keeps me stocked in Burnished Leathers. I have access to all the city chat channels. I can queue for any and all content from there. <br />
<br />
Other than apexis crystal runs and the rare farming outing, I really don't need to leave my garrison for any reason other than a quick farm (and even that is not an issue if you get the mat producing buildings). <br />
<br />
If Blizzard was so concerned about preserving their ground game, it seems counterintuitive to center so much focus on a compound that essentially takes you out of the game world entirely. It's just kind of a puzzling (but funny) decision.:D</div></div><hr />

If flying would be added, all the negative aspects of flying would be added to WoD. It was never fun to have gankers land on top of you in outdoor PvP. Farming mats with a flying mount was also really boring.<br />
<br />
And finally: WoD has been received with incredible enthusiasm. So many people I know have started playing once more! Much more than with any previous expansion! So... all in all WoD delivers in its current state. No need to change up things in a drastic way.<br />
<br />
Like I said difference in interests, you can't tell me what I find fun just like I can't tell you what to find fun. I personally don't gather unless I'm doing it just to get an achievement because of Opportunity Cost. &quot;Negative&quot; aspects is another personal matter, I'm sure the people doing the ganking don't see it as negative but I don't play on a pvp server so that doesn't concern me. Adding flying isn't going to be a drastic change (my opinion) but our opinions differ and that is why flying v. no flying will never end.</div></div><hr />

What about flying do you find fun or what about not flying do you find unfun? Explain and we can talk about solutions. :)</div></div><hr />

Can you explain why world is much more fun without flying. Maybe you explain why i should go out of my garrison. Gathering is pointless in open world, i get all from my garrison. I have done all quests, i dont see any reason to go and run around the so called &quot;epic world&quot;. All the mountains and huge walls makes the open world total s*it hole for me, it is boring to run and run around to get 1 pointless treasure item which isnt for you anyway and you sell it to vendor after picking it up. Without flying i wont bother to go open world, i dont see anything there, im in pve server. And belive me there are lot of players who thinks same as me, WOD is open world killer, there isnt much players who just wanna run around for nothing. Once i get all my apex quests done i dont see any reason to go out of garrison, just raiding and thats it.</div></div><hr />

1) Going everywhere with a ground mount : <br />
way too time consuming.<br />
2) Taking flight paths :<br />
This is the big problem for me, they can attempt fixing this however they want but hopping on some kind of flying animal that takes me somewhere automatically and makes me stare at my screen sometimes for several minutes is not something I want in any game. The vast majority of the time I end up doing something else while it's taking me to my destination. I've always hated flight paths and still having to use them at max level is just making it worse. Every expansion so far I always rushed to max level not to get ready for raiding but to be able to fly.</div></div><hr />

But after 5-6 months, when the world is now longer new, and all the jumping puzzles have been solved, all rares have been killed, and all the landscapes have lost their novelty, being grounded will contribute to burn-out. I liked flying around doing this and that, pet battles, spots of brief farming, archaeology, whatever I happened to see that piqued my interest on my way around the world. Faster flight points won't help that. If anything, it will make it worse. The world will seem less like a world and more like a bunch of barely connected localities with portals between them.</div></div><hr />

Fun? Hitting my insert key and doing circles in the air :D Not fun? wasting time, getting stuck in places I could fly out of.<br />
<br />
I'm not a complicated person, I have something I want to do, I want to get it done as fast as possible. I don't like lore, the environment means nothing to me, I don't do wpvp. I am immersed 0%. To be honest though I'm not worried about the no flying, I know it'll be added back eventually. I don't mind waiting :]</div></div><hr />

That would counter all the people that talk about flying as a way to cheat at treasures hunting.</div></div><hr />

I can agree with this, and not just because I have found 200 treasures and explored all the zones :]</div></div><hr />

I was told that if Blizzard sold level 90's then leveling would become dire because there was no reason for people to do it anymore and then Blizzard wouldn't care about leveling because no one would do it. Interesting how that turned out.</div></div><hr />

In fact, this is the best storyline for an expac since WotLK. Cata was a mess and don't get me started on Pandaria. No one gave a shit about helping some elitist panda people with their moogoo problems. Lei Shen may have been a cool encounter, but no one talks about how epic it was to finally down the moogoo king because no one cares. This is Warcraft at it's finest. Orcs v Humans v Demons. I'm loving it.<br />
<br />
But in regards to no flying? I am SHOCKED that Blizzard has said they have no plans to add flying in 6.1. I really am. I thought they would cave for sure. This is a polarizing topic, but it seems most people do enjoy not having flying in. I personally couldn't have given a shit at first if it was in or not, but after playing without it I'm pretty happy. I feel like the world is alive again. I see people. I see people dying constantly to bad terrain moves in Shattrath or The Pit. The danger is real again. Can't just fly from one part to the other ignoring the world below you. Blizz can let people fly in Draenor when the next expansion is out.<br />
<br />
I do not see any people around the world. Only a casual leveling guys. It is the same if not even more dead then before. Most of my guildies and friends stand only in their garrison. Just casually going out to do daily or two. The sense of danger falling from a cliff? With so bad designed zones for ground mounts its more like sadistic move from blizzard. There is no enjoyment in that. Its complete waste of time. Its an interactive game, not a Mario bros. we should interact in the game not be watching the pixels of the ground just because the cliff was designed bad and you could not see its edge. Its a MMORPG we should have more freedom of choice than we have now.</div></div><hr />
