It is the PvP environment that are whining like little bitches about warriors being so OP, when in fact Blood DK's and Frost Mages are WAY beyond us on anything there is within PvP. Where as you change nothing here other than a tiny little juggernaut mini-nerf where as FURY gets a HUGE nerf for both PvP AND PvE. Great job Blizzcunts.<br />

Sadface on -5% Agility despite it being the right thing to do, I doubt that these MM+BM buffs would make them viable again though. 8% AP increase and 7% and 11% on the specs iconic shots are lackluster.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Reynard</div><div class="date">2011-01-06, 04:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Thoughts so far.<br />
<br />
Blood - Huge hit to survivability with the 60% armor bonus toned down to 30%, and a Death Strike healing nerf too, but probably warranted to put them in line. A little boost to Heart Strike is nice I suppose.<br />
Frost - Rune Strike change is another buff for DK tank damage output. Killing Machine no longer being eaten by Icy Touch is a long-needed quality of life improvement. I was hoping for a Howling Blast nerf, actually, it's the new Bladestorm-on-trash-pack-pull move that drives me up the wall when I'm tanking.<br />
Unholy - Oh god, Unholys can now put even more shit on the ground so I can't see the boss spell effects, great. I don't think a simple 5% strength nerf is going to put them in line either, look forward to a few nerfs with your mastery retooling.<br />
<br />
Druids - Don't play Druid, can't comment. Anyone want to clarify whether these look like a buff or nerf overall?<br />
<br />
Hunter - Ditto from Druid, I don't thing Survival's nerf is going to cut it though.<br />
<br />
Mage - Ouch. That's pretty disheartening. All three specs could use some touchup, especially Arcane, and get nothing. If they are planning on toning down Frost's control &quot;somehow&quot; Frost will need an even larger PvE damage increase. Fire is okayish but there's just not enough crit available to proc half of Fire's talents.<br />
<br />
Retribution - Congrats on the mastery change. You needed it. Feels so strange to feel sorry for paladins.<br />
<br />
Discipline - PW:S adjustments looks like a game changer. That is a big coefficient change, a large mana cost change, even a hefty base absorb change. I'm worried about it in PvP now, that's gonna be annoying. Especially with Strength of Soul now working with Greater Heal and in particular Flash Heal. Multiple target Grace is a very good thing, at least.<br />
Holy - Oh nice, Chakras last a minute now, less needing to refresh that in a hectic moment. Surge of Light needs a higher proc chance period, but adding Greater and Flash into the mechanics is a good start.<br />
<br />
Rogue - Nice boost to Revealing Strike to make it worth using. Main Gauche is boggling to me that it didn't work like that from the start, I thought that was the whole point.<br />
<br />
Shaman - Don't play a shammy, not sure how warranted a complete gloss over is.<br />
<br />
Warlock - Congrats, Warlocks, the nerf bat missed this round. Enjoy it while it lasts.<br />
<br />
Arms - This looks like a little boost? The wording is hard to tell. Is it a permanently maintained stack or a spent one? The Juggernaut change will be interesting to see. Charge generates rage, Intercept consumes it. You get two seconds bonus stun from Charge with this but you basically lose access to Intercept, don't you? No more consecutive gap closers unless you want to use Heroic Leap.<br />
Fury - ...was this really called for?</div></div><hr />

fair enough, nerf cat passive damage, but why the hell the bear nerfs, we were finally in a good place as far as tanking was concerned, after have our &quot;niche&quot; taken away for most of Wrath,<br />

<br />
Talk more shit, the point was, Blizzard said &quot;Bleeds do too much, we want more direct attacks&quot; - I don't think any feral would disagree with that. Bleeds hit too hard, and I personally think the direct attacks are a tiny bit gimpy. So what have they done? They've nerfed the directs. Makes no sense. And before any of the FOTM bullshit, I've played a Feral druid, as both a tank and in PvP since early BC. <br />
<br />
@ Reynard, It's a nerf just about everywhere. Cat damage down (understandable if it was done like they said), but bear damage down? Even on the AoE skills? It's not easy to bear AoE tank as is, the threat is just going to be baad.</div></div><hr />

Btw can anyone explain this to me &quot;Omen of Clarity now procs from damage spells and attacks instead of proc from damage and healing spells&quot;. No more clearcasting for resto druids from heals? How the fuck am i gonna heal when i need 2 spam healing touch and stupid cc doesn't even proc on a regular bases but instead most of the time it comes when u don't really need it. Nice they still messing up with resto trying to make us use regrowth which is such a crap spell it's hardly worth casting. Furthermore they are trying to solve resto burst healing by making us spam rejuv more to actually get a decent effect from shit mastery and nourish spell. <br />

Feral changes are retarded as well. Nobody complained about mangle/trash/swipe(lol soon this ability is gonna tickle people) and other abilities but rather rake/rip combo.<br />

No changes for shamans... .... pokerface.jpg. Good, bad, I just don't know. I'm nervious about healing my first cata raid here...<br />
<br />
Death strike nerfed, ouch. Druid tanks nerfed, double ouch.... those are our two tanks...<br />
<br />
Hope the buff for disc priests works out. (Gosh I wish ours would go holy so bad though...)<br />
<br />
This probably won't go live for awhile anyways, but man. Some of these changes feel &quot;out of the blue&quot; (and not at all what GC had talked about...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why did SB: DL merit a nerf in its base damage?<br />
Why did they nerf CoEx?<br />
<br />
I understand they won't do much about Mages yet, and I prefer they take the time to carefully consider how to fix the class in PVE (low damage/arcane being horrendously designed) and deal with frost in PVP (AND offensive dispelling AND melee interrupts, which is partially why Mages need to rely so much on IL.) What I cannot understand is why they nerfed CoEx. Affliction only has self-healing and very limited CC at its disposal. What on earth made this one kiting ability OP? Moreover, when are they going to address destro's poor performance and Sacrifice's horrible scaling (it's on a 1 min CD and requires a pet summon, it should be pretty good)? Or the Succubus being borderline useless in PVP due to Seduction's cast time?<br />
<br />
<br />
This patch looks like blizzard doenst even play their own game. Especially not in PvP. Hopefull the whining on the forums will give them any idea of how bad this patch is in all possible ways <br />
I agree, I can't believe how poorly advised some of these changes are.</div></div><hr />

But now, a resto druid can link OoC and say, &quot;I'm supposed to do damage even though I'm a healer, so you can heal as a tank/dps.&quot;</div></div><hr />

I prefer they take time with Mages to consider what needs to be done, because there's more issues involved than just IL damage. The class is in a bad shape and they need to look at other aspects of the game, like melee interrupts and dispels, before nerfing Mages. As for PVE, they need to reconsider arcane's playstyle before going ahead and buffing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Deep Freeze. It's what they are going to do every time Frost needs a buff. Eventually DF will crit for like 120k. It's going to get stupid. Any boss with an aggro reset and images on CD is going to guarantee instant aggro and you hit DF on cooldown otherwise goodbye dps...it's not something you can wait a little bit on like combustion.</div></div><hr />

Elaborate. Affliction is OP due to self-healing and mana-draining vs DPS. How does CoEx fit into this? How does just removing Drain Mana without more carefully considering how it might be replaced, needed? They seem to be taking their time to think through how to deal with Mages.

Yeah it is really frustrating. I am not happy at all. I can see them tweaking cat damage (although we were just competitive with other high dps classes, enhance shammies anyone?) but why nerf bears damage? The one glimmer of hope I saw was the good buff to Thick hide though.<br />

Remember this is the PTR peeps (thank god) get there and show blizz their mistakes so they can change them.... again. And remember, they did this with WoTK- they nerf the classes then nerf the instances and raids to compensate. Oh and to DPS warriors- welcome to the arms spec. You'll love it<br />
<br />
It has been my experience that what goes on the PTR goes live, with minor tweaks at most.<br />
<br />
It is very rare for them to revert changes on the PTR. At best they'll say after it goes like, &quot;We agree that something is wrong. We'll look at it in a future patch&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
The following were already in the form of a hotfix that I can find:<br />
(Mangle) Mangle now deals 300% normal damage, down from 360%. Additional damage reduced by 17%, from 1044 to 870.<br />
Thrash base damage has been reduced by 17%, from 243 to 202. Bleed effect base damage also reduced by 17%, from [ 7.8% of AP + 455 ] to [ 7.8% of AP + 379 ]<br />
Lacerate damage has been reduced by 17%, from [ 11.5% of AP + 295.99 ] damage + [ 0.038% of AP + 118.4 ] bleed over 15 sec to [ 9.58% of AP + 246.66 ] damage + [ 0.032% of AP + 98.65 ] bleed over 15 sec.<br />
Frenzied Regeneration now regenerates 0.15% of max health for each point of rage, down from 0.3%.<br />
Swipe base damage has been reduced by 17%, from 171 to 143.<br />
Pulverize now deals 100% weapon damage, down from 120%. Base additional damage reduced by 17%, from 541 to 450.<br />
Maul now scales from 30% of Attack Power, down from 36%.<br />
Source for 17% dmg nerf (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/2089-Patch-4.0.3a-Hotfixes-Portals-Removal-Blue-Posts)<br />
<br />
The rest are <br />
Berserk no longer clears the effect of Fear or makes you immune to Fear for the duration.<br />
Leader of the Pack now causes you to gain 8% of your maximum mana, up from 4%.<br />
Thick Hide now increases armor while in Bear Form by an additional 26/52/78%, up from 11/22/33%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
OOC on offensive spells only??? Blizzard really needs to drop the idea of using offensive spells for mana regen/conservation. It's just plain dumbass in my opinion. I realize that really good druids were making good use of OOC and that popping ToL form and rolling 2 sets of LB for a whole fight me have been an issue, but there are other ways of decreasing the number of OOC procs if they felt it necessary. So I guess it will be interesting to find out if popping a couple of hots on targets will be worth the mana saved by OOC procs.<br />
<br />
As for the bear changes, can't really say too much as I'm not playing a bear atm, but I think bear damage output was way too high for a tank, so understand the desire to lower it. Hopefully they make appropriate changes to threat modifiers to compensate. Bears did feel squishy compared to other tanks, so the armor increase seems like a nice buff.<br />
<br />
Balance changes are uninteresting atm and have no real effect for pve from what I see. I hope to still see some changes to wild mushroom to make it a more viable dps ability. For the amount of key strokes and mouse manipulation it takes to drop 3 mushrooms and detonate, the returns have made it a very situational ability for me atm.</div></div><hr />

It is the PvP environment that are whining like little bitches about warriors being so OP, when in fact Blood DK's and Frost Mages are WAY beyond us on anything there is within PvP. Where as you change nothing here other than a tiny little juggernaut mini-nerf where as FURY gets a HUGE nerf for both PvP AND PvE. Great job Blizzcunts.<br />
<br />
You're on crack. They're nerfing heroic strike, and buffing raging blow both through war academy and an increase to mastery % gained per point, and slam is getting buffed through war academy as well. Stop shedding tears and learn to read, fucking idiot.</div></div><hr />

I dont think those are the exact patch notes Look here http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1765534540 this is the official word from blizz</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Clbull</div><div class="date">2011-01-06, 07:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In my opinion:<br />
<br />
Dk changes are retarded in some respects (i.e. self healing from Death Strike and Armor contribution from Blood Presence when the DK is a tanking class that is overrelient on avoidance anyway) but smart in others (i.e. a buff to Rune Strike damage)<br />
<br />
Druid changes are a bit confusing (if the knockback from Typhoon is removed then HORRAY) but seem retarded (why give bears MORE armor when they have an overpowered amount of it already?)<br />
<br />
Hunter changes are not going far enough. Kill Command needs more than a minor scaling buff to make it worth using over Arcane Shot. Plus Aimed Shot still hits like shit. It needs to hit at least double of what it hits now to make it even worthwhile as an opening 3 second cast or proc based instant again.<br />
<br />
Paladin changes are iffy. I think that revamping Hand of Light and moving the RNG proc elsewhere isn't the right solution. The real issue at hand is the fact that Inquisition doesn't really scale well with Retribution and that the majority of Paladin burst comes from either Hand of Light procs or having the easily dispellable/spellstealable Avenging Wrath up. Personally, I think that Seal of Truth/Righteousness need a major buff, as does the damage from Crusader Strike, Templar's Verdict and Judgement. The matter of the fact is that TV hits far worse than other. more spammable instants.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, the change to Divine Plea, which turned into an unuseable crock of shit anyway (with the mana regen nerf and still a 50% healing debuff) is welcomed. <br />
<br />
Priest changes are retarded. Once again, RMP will be rolling faces and dominating 3v3s again thanks to the significant buff to Overpowered Word: Shield.<br />
<br />
Warlock changes are not going far enough. Many of their Destruction abilities need a nerf. What do they actually get? The removal of Drain Mana...... Removing or overly nerfing the truly overpowered mana drain known as Mana Burn would have helped healers for sure.....</div></div><hr />

*sad face*<br />
Well, I think it's interesting to consider whether resto druids' mana situation is overall better or worse, considering the full notes.<br />
<br />
Negatives: <br />
-OOC only from lifebloom and offensive spells, apparently.<br />
Positive:<br />
-Rejuv mana cost reduced a massive ~38.5%<br />
-Regrowth on Empowered Touch = 10% healing buff<br />
-Glyph of Regrowth now causes the heal-over-time effect to refresh itself on targets at or below 50% health, up from 25%.<br />
-3 or more rejuvs active = 30% cast time reduction on nourish (~43% haste!) = can save a lot of mana by relying on massive nourish throughput increase<br />
<br />
I think it puts resto in a pretty good situation, personally.</div></div><hr />

It's now included on War Academy, which is a 15% buff. There was also an increase to the scaling of the fury mastery.<br />
Heroic strike and cleave were nerfed, both by removal from War Academy and a 20% scaling nerf.<br />
These are good things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In NO way is this going to hurt ret dps. As long as you're smart and keep you inquisition up that holy damage increase with our new mastery will increase our dps but at least 1/3.<br />
Plus we still get the old effect of Hand of light but at a much more steady proc rate of 15% if specced right. Few people would have had their mastery up high enough for that to reach 15% before this BUFF.</div></div><hr />

*Omen of Clarity can no longer trigger from helpful spells (aka heals), unless the Restoration talent Malfurion's Gift is chosen.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sanrio</div><div class="date">2011-01-06, 08:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, I think it's interesting to consider whether resto druids' mana situation is overall better or worse, considering the full notes.<br />
<br />
Negatives: <br />
-OOC only from lifebloom and offensive spells, apparently.<br />
Positive:<br />
-Rejuv mana cost reduced a massive ~38.5%<br />
-Regrowth on Empowered Touch = 10% healing buff<br />
-Glyph of Regrowth now causes the heal-over-time effect to refresh itself on targets at or below 50% health, up from 25%.<br />
-3 or more rejuvs active = 30% cast time reduction on nourish (~43% haste!) = can save a lot of mana by relying on massive nourish throughput increase<br />
<br />
I think it puts resto in a pretty good situation, personally.<br />
<br />
So I have to spend more than 9k mana on Rejuv (that's after the lowered mana cost) in order to make Nourish useful? Yay?</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't even have it on my bars any more... I never have time to use it.<br />
<br />
I'm not just speaking of a healing Priest, there is also Shadow. If they are saying it is unfair to have a mana draining spell because of all the mana issues, then why did they not touch Mana Burn? If I'm not misstaken, that also takes away a healers mana and damages to target...A locks Drain Mana didn't damage the target it just took their mana away. Do you think a Priest isn't going to see a healer in PvP and not mess with it's mana to ensure it can't heal, because that is what the Locks did with Drain Mana to healers? As I see it, if Drain Mana is removed then so should Mana Brun.</div></div><hr />

Rejuvination down to like 3000 mana, nature's bounty a decent talent + glyph of regrowth and regrowth helping lifebloom means no more need for healing touch as a main spell (since it's too slow). 30% speed buff to nourish is O_O <br />
<br />
thank you for listening to druids. I'm excited to play my resto druid again tonight instead of dreading it.</div></div><hr />
