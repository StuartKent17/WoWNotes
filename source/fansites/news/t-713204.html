It'll show zero if you used all 4 copies on a previous PTR test, like me. People who have remaining copies should see the option.</div></div><hr />

I just learned the hard way that beta and alpha testing can be postponed badly. <br />
<br />
I can guess the reason why it was postponed is probably that the Battle.net integration was part of the testing and they wanted it to work with the SC2 beta as well. The only way they can test it proper is with the 2 betas. I can bet that they had some kind of hiccup programming wise and it just took a little while. Also it could be what I stated and a combination of several other things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In the MMO world a WoW beta would dwarf any release in terms of the news coverage and excitement. It probably wouldn't sway any dedicated AOC fans, but it takes a pretty bit bite out of Funcom's hype.</div></div><hr />

It means that character transfers were up on the account management site for a little while. <br />
<br />
Beta has to happen, but there are a few more patches before that. Remember, Ruby Sanctum has to open and we have to figure out all the mechanics on it before it hits live realms so we can have another boring raid to get &quot;phat purps&quot;.</div></div><hr />

3.3.5 and 3.3.9 don't necessarily need to be tested and their release schedule doesn't necessarily impact a beta timeline.</div></div><hr />

It doesn't. It's likely that it won't come at all. (i.e. they left it blank because they didn't consider a bugfix patch to be needed in between 3.3.3 and 3.3.5)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm pretty sure they will have the PTRs available for other patch testing prior to release of Cataclysm (like the pre-launch event as well as other minor patches before then.<br />
<br />
The betas in the past have had their own URL beta.somethingorother.com as opposed to using the PTR's interface for copying/etc... in fact I recall WotLK beta being up as well as PTR and not linked in anyway.<br />
<br />
but I think we all know that regardless.. BETA should be strating within the next month at least...</div></div><hr />

No, a fresh raid encounter doesn't have to be tested. They didn't test Lich King on the PTR.<br />
<br />
And the correct answer about 3.3.1 is there WAS no 3.3.1. We had 3.3.0a and then we got 3.3.2 then 3.3.3.</div></div><hr />

I agree, as far as I know you make premades for arena tournaments and don't copy your own character.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You are incorrect. The Blizzcon Event server is usually where they hold that. It is also where they held the Live Raid.<br />
<br />
They generally do not use these servers for beta. This is probably unrelated to beta.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
No, a fresh raid encounter doesn't have to be tested. They didn't test Lich King on the PTR.<br />
<br />
That's kind of the ultimate encounter for the expansion, so it's an exception. Obviously they eliminated some and focus more internal testing on that. I highly doubt they're not going to test Sanctum.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the correct answer about 3.3.1 is there WAS no 3.3.1. We had 3.3.0a and then we got 3.3.2 then 3.3.3.<br />
<br />
<br />
I stand corrected, they do in fact leave some numeric patches free in case of bug fixes. 3.3.4 can be that.<br />
<br />
That said? Still probably not beta.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I agree, as far as I know you make premades for arena tournaments and don't copy your own character.<br />
<br />

If they didn't change it since the Arena Tournament PTR you make premades and then buy all your gear from vendors for the tournament.</div></div><hr />

Even if they can't right now they'll be more flooded with character copies than usual due to this just because people think it's beta when it's most likely not. Just curious why he had to put the direct to it right on the front page is all. :/</div></div><hr />

No.<br />

We are in the age of the battle.net Account, not the age of beta keys.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is, for sure... NOT the Beta.. again BETAs are accessed thru beta.worldofwarcraft.com<br />
<br />
Only those peeps who have had thier accounts flagged for beta and sent a code will even be able to copy chars.<br />
<br />
However... the recent flood of information regarding the changes usually means BETA is imminent.. Blizzard has made it a point to release the info on chnages (especially potentially controversial changes) in the forums and allow for some discussion and to make sure the CORRECT Blizzard direction/changes are disseminated instead of &quot;surprise changes&quot; that get reported out of context and speculation gives way to a bajillion permutions of hell.<br />
<br />
Since we have seen a ton of info regarding class changes, PvE/PvP, giuld leveling, Archeology, etc... it'sa pretty safe to assume it will be popping in the next 30 days or so.. perhpas tomorrwo who knows.<br />
<br />
Another clue is the 6 months or so before release they generally need... 4 months for testing, 2 months for last minute changes, disc manufacturing, etc... If they started now.. it would land us around the first of November... so yeag it's not too far off.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I remember that too. If you were in the beta, you couldn't join the PTR due to a bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Simple question:<br />
<br />
If a person is unable to copy ANY characters to the test realm, how many characters are being copied to the test realm?</div></div><hr />

Did they stutter? What's hard to understand?<br />
<br />
2 months may sound like longer than &quot;last minute,&quot; but in the world of software development, that is definitely &quot;last minute.&quot;</div></div><hr />

That's an insanely long time for sorting out CDs and last minute changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also in those last 2 months as I said are the logistics of duplication... Generally it's shipped out for duplication 1 month prior to shelf time, and patches are tested in the final 30 days that will be needed since the disc was mastered.<br />

no no no.. really have no idea what this could be, but it will imho not be the beta, as mentioned before, beta requires acc upgrade/special key sent via the opt-in and whatnot; not only simple logging onto your battle.net account and copying your character over to a PTR.</div></div><hr />

This is, for sure... NOT the Beta.. again BETAs are accessed thru beta.worldofwarcraft.com<br />

<br />
Of course. But it doesn't look like it's actually what would normally show up for the PTR either, and I think that what boub hinted at is that they may have simply mistakenly uploaded a beta character copy realm list in the wrong place (ie PTR instead of beta site), or some similar kind of mistake while preparing the beta site (PTR and beta servers and related web applications like character copy have similar functionalities and thus probably share much of the code and just have different configuration files)</div></div><hr />

Blizz has done a few things liek that.. like created pages/sites etc that should not have been able to be accessed by the public.. And for that reason this could be a &quot;flub&quot; of the beginning of the beta server setup.<br />
<br />
If i recall the actual beta site for wotlk was posted a day premature.. (or something was) as I recall it being posted here,,, that it was up... then an hour later... a post saying it had vanished...<br />
<br />
It's coming tho... sad thing is... there's no guarantee any of us (including the beta peeps from WotLK) will be selected... it is an entirely random process based on the pool of peeps that have &quot;opted in&quot; via the Battlenet main account page.</div></div><hr />

IN addition they will also send out complimentary keys to supporting sites and manufactures for promotions, etc...<br />

<br />
That was before the Age of Battle.net.<br />
<br />
Also.. WotLK Beta started around mid to late July 2008 and was released Live mid November 2008... so your estimation of 6 months is off by about 2.<br />
<br />
So.. I'm still betting on Mid September release.</div></div><hr />

how come 'just chillin' ? you got it via email or just something popped up onto your BNet account ?<br />
