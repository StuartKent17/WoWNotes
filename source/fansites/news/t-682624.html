<br />
Epic trailer.<br />
<br />
I too was happy they did an ode to the WC3 cinematic of Arthas killing his father.<br />
<br />
I was wondering if they added any notable characters in the background in the room of souls but I couldn't see any. Anyway, an awesome trailer, worth the wait, and I hope 3.3 is the same.<br />

This is not the last we've seen of the old King of Lordaeron imo; look for an in-game cameo at the end of the Lich King fight. This is also the first time we've seen Arthas' face show under his helm (the glow when he picks up his sword in the trailer) so we may find some human in him after all.</div></div><hr />

Bro, what about the Alliance Raid on the trailer? When Sindragosa comes down, Horde appear on the gunship battle to though :)<br />
<br />
Now that I'm done with that... THAT WAS E-P-I-C!!! Blizzard won over 9000 internetz for that.<br />

<br />
Sure, the frostmourne hungers part is sweet, but...<br />
<br />
Don't take me wrong, this is a good trailer, but i feel that they could have done better.<br />
A bit more story to it, the way the argent crusade united everyone against the LK, the progress of the knights, and a shot of the LK waiting in his throne room.<br />
<br />
Again, it's a nice trailer, just hoped they could surprise me a lot more than they did with it!</div></div><hr />

In fact, he sounds almost exactly like a raspy orc. <br />

yeah ulduar's definitely was better, i wish this had more of the storyline involved. This just makes me believe that the 3.3.x patch with arthas in it will also get it's own trailer. I know it's get a cut scene.</div></div><hr />

Check 1:00. Terenas says: &quot;For all the atrocities you've commited....&quot; and then shuts up rather quickly, like he was going to say something else and had his mic turned off.<br />

It was indeed released on a rush.</div></div><hr />

I think people are just so pumped for the patch that even a completely average trailer like this is seen as amazing. <br />
<br />
I mean how many times are they gonna make a trailer with a &quot;insert let them come variant&quot; followed by &quot;close with a cliche one liner&quot;. I thought that was what really made trailers like Ulduar stand out. <br />

I agree. We are dealing with a split here.<br />
<br />
Notice how Arthas never actually responds to his father; it is as though the ghosts are delusions and he is haunted by the piece of humanity within him.<br />
<br />
It is only when he picks up Frostmourne do these thoughts (and ghosts) disappear; his humanity is overpowered and he is encapsulated by the Lich King.</div></div><hr />

Or the trailer is actually deeper than you think, considering the father/son relation of Terenas and Arthas and the fact that &quot;Frostmourne Hungers!&quot; is from Warcraft III?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Actually, it's the same dynamic that Arthas and Terenas had in the past. Arthas always ignored his father lessons and lectures, which led him to where we all know. He does the same in the trailer and again it will led to his fall.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CCGuy</div><div class="date">2009-12-09, 01:05 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was satisfied. That isn't to say it was Blizzard's best, because it wasn't. But I wasn't really expecting anything different than this. And it was, in a way, what I was wanting. It's the final showdown we've been waiting for for over a year, and the lore-hungry of us have already absorbed pretty much everything there is. Is now the time to suddenly throw a screwball?<br />
<br />
Or to put it like this: The Ulduar trailer (to mention one example) needed the story hook, because we weren't really wanting to go there,were we? We wanted to face down Arthas as soon as possible. So, the Ulduar trailer was psyching it up because we weren't psyched for it in advance, and also because there was much lore about Ulduar not known about, being far less exposed in advance by the Storm Peaks quests (mostly just hinting at things).<br />
<br />
But we are already psyched up for Arthas, and most of Northrend has already dealt with much of the story, especially the Icecrown quests. So yeah, a simple, well done &quot;this is it&quot; style trailer that suited me fine. Besides, I'm more eager to actually play through the Icecrown Citadel than to watch trailers anyway. :D</div></div><hr />

I liked it, but I also agree that the excitement of 3.3 is the main driving force of the trailer. Knowing that the last chunk of WC3 story is coming to a close is almost sentimental in its own way. I still want to know if Ner'zhul is gonna make a comeback, but we'll just have to wait and see.</div></div><hr />

He's the lich king and nothing else, if you're gonna call him Arthas you might as well call him Ner'zhul too.<br />

&quot;By allowing me to peer into his heart, you allowed me to confirm what I needed to know. There is no Arthas Menethil anymore -- there is only the Lich King.&quot;<br />

well by that logic we should be calling him Ner'zul, considering its pretty much confirmed he trapped arthas and is now the dominating spirit. Badass and WAT at the same time.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Can you feel it, my son? Closing in all around you, the light's justice has been awakened. The sins of the past have finally caught up to you. You WILL be called to account for all the atrocities you committed, the unspeakable horrors you have loosed on this world, and the dark, ancient powers you have enslaved. Though my soul was one of the first to be devoured by your evil, there are thousands of more bound within this blade, and they cry out... for release. Look now to your defenses, my son, for the champions of justice gather at your gate!&quot;</div></div><hr />

But that's fine, cuz this is, no doubt, just a little sneak preview. I'm sure they'll be lots of epic cinematics in the raid. This is obviously just to hold us over.</div></div><hr />

<br />
of course he's a bad director in terms of quality, but he's a fucking god when it comes to making movies that bring in ridiculous amounts of money, which is what people like him are obviously after<br />
<br />
this trailer isn't &quot;good&quot; in the sense of great literature, but who gives a damn? it's awesome given what it is. gave me the chills, and the vast majority of WoW players seem to love it or at least like it... which was, you know, the entire point<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kamzy</div><div class="date">2009-12-09, 04:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Why are people still calling him Arthas?<br />
Arthas is no more.<br />
He's the lich king and nothing else, if you're gonna call him Arthas you might as well call him Ner'zhul too.<br />
<br />
In the Tirion's Gambit quest;<br />
&quot;By allowing me to peer into his heart, you allowed me to confirm what I needed to know. There is no Arthas Menethil anymore -- there is only the Lich King.&quot;<br />
<br />
OT; awesome trailer. The Frostmourne hungers part sent chills down my spine. ^^;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
well by that logic we should be calling him Ner'zul, considering its pretty much confirmed he trapped arthas and is now the dominating spirit. Badass and WAT at the same time.<br />
<br />
<br />
both of you need to read this (http://www.amazon.com/World-Warcraft-Arthas-Rise-Lich/dp/1416550771)</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Morpheuspt</div><div class="date">2009-12-09, 05:04 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was satisfied. That isn't to say it was Blizzard's best, because it wasn't. But I wasn't really expecting anything different than this. And it was, in a way, what I was wanting. It's the final showdown we've been waiting for for over a year, and the lore-hungry of us have already absorbed pretty much everything there is. Is now the time to suddenly throw a screwball?<br />
<br />
Or to put it like this: The Ulduar trailer (to mention one example) needed the story hook, because we weren't really wanting to go there,were we? We wanted to face down Arthas as soon as possible. So, the Ulduar trailer was psyching it up because we weren't psyched for it in advance, and also because there was much lore about Ulduar not known about, being far less exposed in advance by the Storm Peaks quests (mostly just hinting at things).<br />
<br />
But we are already psyched up for Arthas, and most of Northrend has already dealt with much of the story, especially the Icecrown quests. So yeah, a simple, well done &quot;this is it&quot; style trailer that suited me fine. Besides, I'm more eager to actually play through the Icecrown Citadel than to watch trailers anyway. :D<br />
<br />
<br />
So what you're saying is, they made a mediocre trailer (just don't start with me, even if you think it's OMFGlolzorepic, take a few steps back, breathe, and see it a couple more times, but pay close attention. Or even better, check the ZA traler and/or the BT trailer.) because they knew that people wouldn't care if it was rubbish as long as it had a few SS of Arthas/ICC in it?<br />
<br />
That's the same as saying: Hey, i'm gonna make a batman movie, it'll be total shit but since it's batman, people will go nuts for it?</div></div><hr />

Since if you don't know the story of Arthus by now in Warcraft lore you must not pay that much attention. But it could do without the flashes of boss battles and crap in it.<br />
<br />
Oh and I agree with the micheal bay guy is a crap directer but who wouldn't want him to make you a movie to get a s&amp;^% ton of money?</div></div><hr />

Christ, with all the excitement over &quot;frostmourne hungers&quot; you guys must still get excited when you hear &quot;It's morphing time&quot; rofl.<br />
<br />
You were probably one of those saying the WotLK intro cinematic was crap, because it lacked action.<br />
<br />
It doesn't need much action when talking about such a major lore figure as the Lich King. It's not a movie to hype you up before you go storming into the Citadel. The point of these trailers is showing some lore behind the patch, and the whole point of the Lich King is that he's just waiting there to unleash his horrors upon us.<br />
<br />
And &quot;Frostmourne hungers&quot; has been a trademark battlecry of Arthas since WC3, and is even revisited in Arthas: Rise of the Lich King. Plus, it's pretty badass.</div></div><hr />

Read &quot;FAIL&quot; too, this is probably because of the graphical image of the word that is stuck in all of our minds (well, at least most of us), there was no need to read the trailer's end logo to recognize a good old &quot;FAIL&quot; :D First thought it was a prank edition of some sort.<br />

Every single video that's been made by blizzard is awesome! Ofc the cinematic videos are even better but this one is amazing as well.

<br />
<br />
First, I am disappointed that no Alliance/Horde game version of this http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gI6sARmxEuc&amp;feature=related, ie <br />
<br />
'Thrall that is all the soldiers you brought?' - Varian<br />
<br />
'You Alliance solider what is your profession?' - Thrall<br />
<br />
'Me, I'm a jewel craftier .' - Alliance Soldiers<br />
<br />
'You, Night Elf?' Thrall<br />
<br />
'I'm a tailor.' - Alliance Soldiers 2.<br />
<br />
'You, Dranai?' - Thrall<br />
<br />
'I'm a blacksmith.' - Alliance Soldiers 3<br />
<br />
'HORDE WHAT IS YOUR PROFESSION?!' - Thrall<br />
<br />
'ZUG ZUG ZUG ZUG ZUG!' - Horde<br />
<br />
'Da Bu.' - Thrall<br />
<br />
'That's okay, what they lack in experience they make up in enthusiasm. Alliance?!' - Varian<br />
<br />
'HO HO HO HO!' - Alliance <br />
<br />
'If you boys are done showing off your who's army is bigger, we have monster to fight.' Jania<br />
<br />
<br />
Back to the point it supposed to go like this, the Fall or Fail of the Lich King and then just as the celebrations begin.<br />
<br />
BOOOM.<br />
<br />
Deathwing (for what ever reason, perphaps he feels the Lich Kings defeat and that awakens him) burn his way across the Azeroth.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Nekosom</div><div class="date">2009-12-09, 01:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Fine, I'll be the first one to say it. The Black Temple and Ulduar trailers are fucking terrible. I find it hilarious that people would say, &quot;Oh you stupid fanboys loving this trailer, those other ones were a lot better,&quot; when it could only take a truly mindless fanboy to appreciate the drivel in those trailers. I cringed at the Black Temple trailer, as Akama has to have a monologue to explain how Illidan's character could change so completely between Warcraft III and Burning Crusade, or why we would want to kill him in the first place. Personally, I had no desire to kill Illidan, and Akama's speech only made me realize how much Blizzard had raped such a great lore character so they could make a viable end-boss.<br />
<br />
Then the Ulduar trailer...good lord, what cheesy dialogue. It was funny that I related with Garrosh and Varian in being completely dismissive of this so-called &quot;Death God.&quot; The whole trailer was just meant as a feeble attempt to try and get us to actually care about killing this giant clam with teeth. I mean, shouldn't we be focused on the Lich King?<br />
<br />
Now of course, I understand the point in such trailers. They're a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine go down. They need these story sequences to try and get players interested. But when I see those trailers all I can see are cheesy attempts at stretching out the storyline.<br />
<br />
But the Fall of the Lich King trailer...there is no need to make us care. There is nothing to explain. We are finishing up a storyline that has been in progress for such a very long time. The poignancy of Terenas lecturing his son, telling him that he will finally pay for his crimes...it's hard not to love it, if you actually care about a little thing called &quot;storytelling.&quot; It is the same thing that made the Wrath of the Lich King cinematic trailer so great. It doesn't need to tell the player why the fight is important...it just reminds us of why it is. It is dialogue that would fit perfectly in Warcraft III, and that is a GOOD thing. No cheese factor, just poetry in motion.</div></div><hr />

In the Fall of the Lich King trailer you can see the spikes from the top of Arthas' helmet.<br />

(Always needed a reason to make an account on MMOChampion, was good enough of one for me.)<br />

Also, not to mention the rear spike on King Menethil's crown is also missing when you view the Fall of the Lich King trailer, versus the original.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you were refering to his voice changing, it may just be he just got a cold... ::)<br />
<br />
I don't see any similarities between, Darth and Arthas. I mean Arthas has his ability to control the scourge, Darth Vaders has his death star, they are both weapons of with a mass destructive scale . But there's this thing, a death star, it can destroy entire planets! Darth Vader destroys billions of lives on the press of a button. Arthas can't match that.</div></div><hr />

This is contradictory: apparently a monologue is not storytelling, whereas having nothing to explain is important. Lectures are poignant, only when lectures are not monologues .... you are not prepared!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
The LK trailer is very well produced, but OK, I preferred the BT trailer myself.<br />
I'm iced out on the LK/Scourge/Northrend story. For somewhere scary and cold, I think it has got too much exposure and has lost some of the fear factor.<br />
<br />
1. Kill random quest enemy.<br />
2. The LK appears: &quot;I'm very angry but I won't kill you now&quot;, etc.<br />
3. The LK disappears.</div></div><hr />

indeed. I REALLY hope in Cataclysm, Deathwing isn't waiting behind every corner waiting to go &quot;boo! I gotchu! bwahaha! but! I'm not gonna kill you! cause im stupid! and umm! Stuff!&quot;<br />
<br />
Arthas had so much over exposure, he pretty much lost the mysterious edge he still had on opening day, when most rolled a DK only to find a 10 foot tall lich king giving out quests.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you think back to BC, the only time you ever saw Illidan was actually in BT so when you saw him you were like ommgggggg. In WOTLK though you see him everywhere, I would be more excited to kill him if he wasn't in almost every new dungeon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But that also advances the story and the impact he has on it. In TBC the story was dull because well what did Illidan even do? Why were we going after him? He was involved in like 2 questlines...and 1 we didnt even see him during it.</div></div><hr />

i am sure u did not want that..<br />
Yes, Arthas was appearing often, its something called lore, and actually some ppl give a shit about it. He appears when u create a DK, ofc he is, he created the Death Knights lorewise!<br />
He appears in some quests and instances, ofc he is! its lore-history! he was a noble paladin, beeing corrupted, did evil things and now he is the LK, do not u want to find out why and how was that happened? Its a good aspect of the game besides kill kill kill, loot loot loot ePiXzors!!!!<br />
If u just want to kill things with your pew pew mage/rogue w/e, go and play CS or Half Life...<br />
Why he did not kill u so far? i saw an other post, i do not remember when that explained that thing.. and its also explained in the new instances, he want u to be good, he wants u to be powerfull, so, when he kills u, he will have a powerfull scourge army.<br />
The trailer is good, ok, he is not in prison 10000 years, he is not holding a scull, and he cannot fly, but still, he bit the guy that could fly, was holding a scull, was prisoned for 10000 years and actually was holding not one, but two legendary weapons... Ok, Frostmourne is full of souls but who cares.. :P</div></div><hr />

Arthas was never lich king :) Lich king and Arthas united in Arthas body+ Lich Kings Mind and Arthas has just some presence in that mind.</div></div><hr />
