Earlier this week, a survey was sent to european players to gather data on ... tons of things related to WoW. Hidden among the general WoW questions was a fairly interesting one : <br />

Apparently, Blizzard is seriously considering offering more character slots to players but you might have to pay for that. Just keep in mind that this is just a survey for the moment and it doesn't accurately reflect what we will or will not get in the future.<br />

Existing Currencies/Badges in Cataclysm<br />
We think it's fair to let you know what's going to happen to all of that old currency. It's not yet time for us to discuss that entire plan, but we'll do so in enough time for your to react.<br />
<br />
Overall, you can expect that there won't be much motivation to hoard and even less to go out and farm old content in preparation for the Cataclysm launch.<br />
<br />
We would definitely like to get some of that stuff out of your currency UI so you don't have to look at that lonely Badge of Justice for the rest of your character's career. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25171673754/something-we-all-deserve-to-know-before-cata/))<br />

Masteries - Investing in multiple trees<br />
Almost everyone at max level will want at least 51 / something / something to gain full benefit of their passive talent trees. A Shadow priest might be something like today's 14/0/57, (Maybe 21/0/55? Maybe 15/0/61?) because we're not giving them much reason so far to subspec Holy at all. A warlock or hunter at the moment (in Cataclysm) might choose a 51/10/15, meaning points in all 3 trees. This is all early though and sometimes players don't end up going with the builds we think they will and we want you to have more flexibility than you do today. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25170780522/cataclysm-affliction-question-for-devs/))<br />
<br />
200% Spell Crit in Cataclysm<br />
If so, does that mean smaller crits, or does that mean 200% spell crits baseline?<br />
We're not sure yet. For the hybrid classes, having the 200% crits is a good way to distinguish the casters from the non-casters (jn terms of keeping healers or melee specs from doing quite so much damage with spells). For mages and locks there is less reason for them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25170780522/cataclysm-affliction-question-for-devs/))<br />
<br />
&quot;Chaotic&quot; world in Cataclysm<br />
For all of the zones that take a turn for the worse, I would say there's an equal number of zones which improve in the chaos. Our goal is not to make the leveling experience dreary, or show you how much we can decimate familiar places. We want to add some vigor back into the old world in the wake of cataclysmic change.<br />
<br />
[...] Just to clarify, in many cases there are different areas in each zone with different types of changes. So, maybe the Barrens has been ruptured in half and made a tumultuous place of battle between the Alliance and the Horde in the south, but there are areas of the Barrens that look more beautiful than ever before. The changes in cataclysm aren't being made to shift the scale toward ugly, unforgiving terrain. You'll find a multitude of differing environments within each zone, and within the overall world.

Armory: Guild Bank Logs Outdated<br />
We are aware of an issue which exists presently on the World of Warcraft Armory site preventing guild bank logs from properly updating. We’re working to apply a fix for this issue and will provide an update when we have an estimated timeframe for resolution.

European Beta Guild Contest<br />
This is pretty much the case; we'll just have to see. Obviously the EU has a lot more countries and laws to take into account. Anyhow, should we have any similar announcement to make, you won't have to ask here to find out about it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/13705421290/cataclysm-beta-guild-contest/))<br />

Arcane Missiles<br />
The idea is to keep Arcane Missiles as a core mechanic that all mages want to use when it procs, but it's possible some spec may end up not using it if their other spells are propped up enough that you don't want to spend the cast time. We'll have to see when we get a little further in beta. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25170780522/cataclysm-affliction-question-for-devs/))<br />

http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/24x24/warlock.jpg Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-warlock/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?warlock))<br />
Warlocks in Cataclysm<br />
Sorry, we just don't agree that that is a problem. It doesn't really matter if the talents are in a tree with a different name than your spec as along as the talents are useful, and those 15 certainly are.<br />
<br />
To reiterate, we like Affliction using Shadow Bolt. We don't want Affliction to rely so much on Drain Soul because that feels a lot like a Shadow priest, and we don't like any class casting nothing but dots. So Shadow Bolt is sticking around. We also don't have a problem with Shadow Bolt being a Destruction spell and being buffed by the Destruction tree. Furthermore, we have no problem with Destro using something other than Shadow Bolt even though it's a Destruction spell. Finally, we don't mind that all of those talent points buff one spell. It's a really important spell! If you had to spend 15 points to buff a spell that was a trivial amount of your damage it would be a bigger deal, but then I'm fairly sure nobody would make that talent point investment in the first place.<br />
<br />
All of those arguments seem like they offend your logic or something, which isn't enough grounds for us to want to change it. Different classes work differently. Mages focus on a school of magic while warlocks focus more on a source of damage (dots, pets and nukes) but even in that case, that doesn't mean they focus on their damage source to an extent that the mage focuses on Fire, Frost or Arcane (and in Cataclysm all mages will care a lot about Arcane Missiles in any event). We are really trying to resist class homogenization and having talent trees constructed similarly for every class works against that goal. Not similar is fine. Not functional is not fine.<br />
<br />
What does bother us is having to get both Affliction and Destruction versions of hit, threat reduction, pushback resistance and range in addition to the crit damage from Ruin. Our plan is to put generic (affects all spells) talents for hit and pushback resistance in the first tier of Demonology and then just make the spells longer range so there is no need for a range talent. We're getting rid of all threat reduction talents. With the extra Cataclysm talent points, you should have more than enough points to get some in Demo and Destro as Affliction, and in fact we're leaning towards warlocks being one of those classes that does invest a little in all three trees. (Though again, not to the extent that you have no flexibility.)<br />
<br />
If you're one of those warlocks who just really, really wants Affliction or Shadow Bolt to work differently, well, you have my apologies. No doubt if you were in our shoes you might design different talent trees. I have tried to explain our choice for the design above.<br />

Video Games Live Comes to PBS<br />
If you love videogame music and the music of Blizzard Entertainment, then you’ll want to keep your eyes and ears glued to your local PBS station this summer. For the first time ever on television, PBS will feature a “Video Games Live” concert special which will include three pieces of Blizzard music for your enjoyment: StarCraft II – Wings of Liberty Main Theme, Lament of the Highborne (featuring Vangie Gunn), and the Warcraft Suite.

The remote auction house doesn't interest me. I especially don't want to log into battle.net while at work. Who knows what malware could potentially be floating around. I really hope that it doesn't present security issues for people using it on their iphones and the like, too.<br />

Pretty much this. If you're the sort that spends so much time on WoW that you've got a full roster of characters on a given realm, all level capped, full tweaked out uber-characters that you can't bear to part with, you're probably the sort that would be happy to toss Blizz more money for extra character slots.<br />

Some of us don't have lowbie toons on said realm. I know on my main realm, I personally don't have a toon under 70. Honestly, I'm tired of having to switch my AH/Bank bitch when I decide to finish leveling the current one. lol</div></div><hr />

I heard that Blizzard has made around 4 millions of profits within the first 4 hours after the release of the ugliest and useless mount ever. *cough* Celestial Steed *cough*<br />

I think the point is that you might want to focus on a couple dozen or so of those 50 characters instead of starting more.<br />
<br />
Odds are you can delete 3/4 of those as you haven't played them since Vanilla &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, pretty much. :P Anybody that has actually run out of space and has no characters he or she is willing to delete probably would be very happy to pay a fee for more character slots, seeing as they've obviously already poured a vast, vast, vast amount of time into the game.</div></div><hr />

I'm willing to do it if the cost is right, but with the overcharging for mounts/fraction/server transfers I expect it to be around 20-30$ /sigh.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I can understand there were probably technical limitations in vanilla and BC, maybe even Wrath...but combine Moore's law and all the money they are raking in, I think they can easily accommodate us.<br />

Next xpac = new class = Buy buy some more slots! I want to see it then how many will pay for the slot to play the new class, after they payed for the expansion. This company it's getting way to greedy.</div></div><hr />

We think it's fair to let you know what's going to happen to all of that old currency. It's not yet time for us to discuss that entire plan, but we'll do so in enough time for your to react.<br />

Overall, you can expect that there won't be much motivation to hoard and even less to go out and farm old content in preparation for the Cataclysm launch.<br />

Because you don't have to buy dessert if you don't want to. If you don't want to have that new class as a character you might level to max level, might as well make it on another server. And the resteraunt was an analogy.</div></div><hr />

More charecter slots would be nice. However, the idea of having to dish out more money for them would not be nice. I think you should be able to have 50 charecters spread out among whatever servers you choose, with no cap on how many per server. As an example, we have a 10cap per server now. I would like to have say, 15 charecters on my current server, 9 on an alt server, etc. Take the 50, spread it out however you want.<br />

Atleast in the original guild wars you gained 2 additional character slots FREE with the purchase of each new expansion...<br />
<br />
Granted content in the old one was very few and far between compared to the regularity of WoW. but they had the right idea... something blizzard should consider adopting. <br />

Yeah but you can't compare a restaurant with a pay to play abo mmo. Anyhow not like u did it.<br />
<br />
Let's say there is this new restaurant, with a ad banner, &quot;All you can eat, for 15 bucks a month&quot;<br />
<br />
So you get in there, all nice, and eat there everyday. So after a while, mangagement changes and now the deserts costs extra. And than the Soup and than that and that and after some time all you get for your 15 bucks is breed and water.<br />
<br />
We don't want Micro Transactions in a Pay to Play MMO, vote all on &quot;not interestet&quot; and Blizzard will bring it for free, but if you show interest they will bring it for money, and other things to.<br />
<br />
Hell i have nothing that Blizzard wants to make money, just raise the monthley cost for 1 or 2 bucks, if the more content comes, and no more &quot;Premium things&quot;<br />
<br />
Wheres Xibit when you need him<br />

no, but Acitivision is making blizzard piss off alot of people thinking it won't get to the point where the game falls into complete disrepair and expect everyone to wake up the next day and keep throwing money at Blizzard and keep p(l)aying the game.<br />
<br />
it's almost there, the day, where the more money you are willing to toss at blizzard Activision, will prove your playing potential, and i and many other people i know will be gone before that happens, and after Activision has sucked blizzard dry like the insect they are, they'll run off and find a new host to latch onto and drain, by then blizzard and World of warcraft, Battle.net and Starcraft will long be dead and i'll be playing Old Republic</div></div><hr />

Seriously, it'd be bad enough saying you have 50 indispensable toons, but when you add that you've shelled out a thousand bucks on virtual accessories...well, strangely, I was overwhelmed with pity for you.<br />
<br />
I'm all for spending your free time doing whatever makes you happy...I even understand spending a little scratch here and there for a leisure activity that does absolutely nothing to better you as a person (ie. not a hobby that provides some new skill or asset like sailing or rapelling or some such), but you may as well have said. &quot;I've already maxed my opiate tolerance and spend $50 a day on heroin but I dunno if I'd be willing to pay my dealer an extra couple bucks for sterile syringes if he offered them - but I'd probly end up doing it anyway.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hmmm...now that I think about it, what you said was actually worse, cuz at least with the heroin habit you'd have a tangible, real-world asset in exchange for your time and money (even if you ravenously consumed it shortly thereafter).<br />
<br />
<br />
50 Toons include many cross server bank toons who search the AH a lot. It's my choice of what I want to do with my money and I'm still have paid off all my bills and got what I want. By having many toons - I make my gold easily in game. And I've raided on 6 different servers with being horde/alliance.<br />
<br />
I do have many hobbies as well such as playing bass and going to the gym every day at 5AM. Well when I do think about it, I do have the money and so many other people do as well. Can't be aimed directly at myself.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I would atleast never pay for any slots, or anything for that matter, cause imo all those things are useless _to me_ and I rather spend my money on<br />
girlfriend or friends. I mean lets think about the pets and mount.. I mean why pay for that? ppl hardly see pets (atleast me) and none care about ppls mount enough to make it worth the money. if I wanted to play pokemon I would'nt play this game, this is not how I see wow, the day they start giving gear away that day I would definetly stop playing.<br />

Up until now, the services that are available through paying, aren't offering any advantage ingame. No matter the amount of money one pays to Blizzard he won't end up having a stronger toon which is all that really matters. On top of that, Blizzard representatives already said many many times that armor upgrades etc via money will NEVER EVER be available. Paying for character transfers, pets, mounts and any cosmetic stuff, remote AH features etc is totally fine and harmless for the game.<br />
<br />
That being said i'll admit i would be the first one to quit wow the day $$$ can buy better gear or give the slightest advantage to any toon ingame.<br />
Concerning the extra character slot-s i bet the interest would be great.<br />
I, for example, have 10 alliance lvl 80 chars in the server i play and i would just love to create some horde and worgen toons. Alts have kept me playing this game all these years and i believe one ore two extra character slots is something that should come without any fee. We've kinda &quot;earned&quot; it after all these years. If not anything else it'll keep us ,alt freaks, interested longer in this game... (i would never ever pay for it though)</div></div><hr />

Up until now, the services that are available through paying, aren't offering any advantage ingame. No matter the amount of money one pays to Blizzard he won't end up having a stronger toon which is all that really matters. On top of that, Blizzard representatives already said many many times that armor upgrades etc via money will NEVER EVER be available. Paying for character transfers, pets, mounts and any cosmetic stuff, remote AH features etc is totally fine and harmless for the game.<br />
<br />
That being said i'll admit i would be the first one to quit wow the day $$$ can buy better gear or give the slightest advantage to any toon ingame.<br />
Concerning the extra character slot-s i bet the interest would be great.<br />
I, for example, have 10 alliance lvl 80 chars in the server i play and i would just love to create some horde and worgen toons. Alts have kept me playing this game all these years and i believe one ore two extra character slots is something that should come without any fee. We've kinda &quot;earned&quot; it after all these years. If not anything else it'll keep us ,alt freaks, interested longer in this game... (i would never ever pay for it though)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Agree with this dude, those people with that many alts earned it truly, I mean that would be an achievement to get 10 alts and achi reward should be extra slot.</div></div><hr />

Damn....<br />
<br />
Even so, I would pay for additional slots, but only one-time and very little, like 3-5 bucks, not more. <br />
If I was really that desperate for slots on the same server (which I'm not, I have 7 characters at 80 beside my main that get barely any gametime at all, why do I need 5 more that just stand around?) I'd reactivate my second account, that's a lot more new slots + the ability to dual-box to run dungeons solo etc.</div></div><hr />

time to even care about the 3 chars I usually play, so either this hits parents wallets, or make people unemployed for rest of wow, cause honestly if you filled<br />
all slots and you _PLAY_ all (meaning raiding/gearing/pvping) you simply have no time to work/school, or do you keep em as a nostalgia from past expac?<br />

either way, point is: either your not a dedicated player of your class and your simply holding on to as many chars as possible to not notice you have stopped<br />

Yes they were quite tactful in not giving you that option. I'm very interested in getting another character slot however I would hope it would be free. The sort of people who have enough alts on one server to warrent having another slot are ones who have probably been sinking money in to WoW for quite some time.<br />

Yes, it's the &quot;but I pay 12 EUR every month&quot; whine, but why were those 12 EUR enough money for them for 5 long years to develop those great addons and content patches and now they're desperate to milk the last drop out of us?<br />

Overpriced faction, race and name changes. Mounts in the store made them millions.. Greed is slowly taking over and I see microtransactions as the final step to milk the last drops when they decide to let wow die.<br />

I understand mounts, pets, and even the Remote Auction House thing. But to even consider charging your customers for this... just silly.<br />
<br />
There's been 10 Classes for an entire expansion. They knew this would fill all available character slots (if you have 1 of each on a server), so they make two more Races and make you pay to have the space to use them?<br />

<br />
It's true that nobody has time to get 10 level 80 chars all geared up raiding and pvping, but most altoholics don't raid/pvp or gear up all their characters. They could have one or a few for raiding, but the rest is for fun doing questing, levelling, or something else.<br />
<br />
I, for example, do a bit of raiding occasionally at my main, a Holy Priest, and gearing up two other 80s a bit in heroics. I'm currently leveling my DK to 80, but I don't plan on using that char for raids. (I might buy a few Tier 9 pieces from Heroics to make grinding for whatever I'll be grinding for easier). Then I got 6 other character in the level range 20 to 60, which I eventually hope to level to 80 (or 85) someday. No rush. I got a slot for each class.<br />
<br />
However, I would love to level a feral druid to see how it works. And no, I don't want to respec my 80 Moonkin. I want to *level* my feral druid, get used to it and feel how it feels. The same with a Discipline Priest. I want to level one, not respec my 80 Holy Priest. And then there's new races to try soon, and perhaps a bank-alt would be nice too. Plenty of reasons to need more character slots for me, even if only my main does a bit of raiding and pvping :P</div></div><hr />

Buying a second account would give you more character slots too, and thus would have the same results. No change there. Which also means that the price of additional character slots should be lower than the price of an additional account, in order to be useful :P</div></div><hr />

Sure they are a company, and sure they want to make money, but this can also be refered<br />

cause you need it (expac), then they make you pay even more cause then you need it to play(&quot;keep up&quot;)/live (mounts/pets).<br />
then you probably sitting there with paying 300$ a month, but hey it's optional ;)<br />

&quot;Everybody calm down, compose yourself&quot;.<br />
<br />
What is the use of all this anger about something that is very far from becoming a reality? How many of you actually have reached their character limit cap on their main server? Why do you care about something you have a choice in? If you do not want to buy the slot, then do not. Do not focus your rage at Blizzard and/or Activision and/or the players buying the extra slot for which ever purpose (RP, just because they can, perhaps that Goblin/Worgen).<br />
<br />
I will not buy an extra slot - if it ever become a reality - because I am far from the character cap but I know people in my guild will because they want to play with every single class and race possible. Is it my obligation to tell them off, to tell them they are 'idiots'?<br />

Would this not fall under the &quot;Real Life money giving in-game advantages&quot; line they're steadily pushing?<br />
<br />
I understand mounts, pets, and even the Remote Auction House thing. But to even consider charging your customers for this... just silly.<br />
<br />
There's been 10 Classes for an entire expansion. They knew this would fill all available character slots (if you have 1 of each on a server), so they make two more Races and make you pay to have the space to use them?<br />
<br />
Ugh... Just obnoxious. <br />

&quot;We've finally implemented the much asked for option to expand your backpack! Simply go to Beezo Threadspindle in Booty Bay and then go to the online store and pay us 5 bucks.

But hey, Blizzard is very creative to get money. Let's see, what's next:<br />

I intentionally said they'll charge you money because in the end they will no matter what the result would be of the survey. They will call it a premium service (You want it? Buy it!)<br />

At least Kotick was honest when he chose words for how to make profit from games: Exploiting game franchises, which have the potential to be multi-million $$ sellers and he found his gold-shitting donkey in WoW.<br />

I'm ok with all they brought up in the past, but seriously, this ? Almost every player that has been playing from the beginning need this extra-slot. They should give it for free :l<br />

The idea is to keep Arcane Missiles as a core mechanic that all mages want to use when it procs, but it's possible some spec may end up not using it if their other spells are propped up enough that you don't want to spend the cast time.

<br />
Not that it matters any. Subscriber base isn't indicative of quality at all.<br />
<br />
<br />
well, sure it looks like a loss, but ofc first base game will been bought more than expac as people we're trying the game out<br />
stopped cause of QQing, ninjas, emoragers, emoquitters, nubs, employments (aka time), family, addiction etc etc <br />
the numbers of the chart seems about the right way it should look, cause lets face it, none will be playing forever.<br />
<br />
but I would think the money loss of subscribers could might aswell add up with sales of items, but the drawback might be<br />
that too many are leaving cause of the pay for X item also, so it would turn into a vicious circle the more people dropping game<br />
the more stuff they need to sell, the more interesting they need to make the items, wich will end up to selling gear, wich makes<br />
the game pointless to play. so it might look good for em now, butpeople will get older and stop playing and more children might play<br />
wich means sales might not be the best way to go.<br />
<br />
Point are: make the game quality not quantity, if there are absolutley no achivement behind teh items, it will rend it useless and meaningless.</div></div><hr />

When I started playing FF11 like 5 years you had to pay 1 Dollar for each additional character you wanted to create. I don't know if that has changed in the meantime, but hell, you can create 50 (!) characters on your account, and 10 per server without paying. That's enough for having each class on a server. If that really, really isn't enough for you, you should be glad to pay a little extra fee for creating even more characters than that.</div></div><hr />

It's merchandise, and some is better than others. Extra character slots are NOT merchandise and should just simply be added into Cataclysm. If Activision wants to make more money off of wow, just add some more aesthetics-only items to the Blizzard store, and leave the game design solely to the xpac.

And now the remote AH and this? How much I wanna say that I will NOT pay for another char slot, I know that Cata is comming out and that you would want to have goblins/worgens.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is smart when it comes to marketing but they are really pushing their players. Don't we already pay monthly for services like that? I wish they rather fixed things like that within our monthly pay then listening to all the QQ from 12 year olds that don't like a class or loot system or dungeon system so that blizzard changes everything for them.<br />

Blizzard is the same company it has always been, Activision didn't buy Vivendi, and Activision has zero say in anything that Blizzard does, Vivendi Games PARENT company bought Activision, and merged every one of their game studios besides Blizzard into one company and left Blizzard to function as it always has...<br />
<br />
The problem is, one, people have already shown a willingness/openness to micro-transactions, and two, there was a story awhile ago about how World of Warcraft's population hit it's peak, so with no new subscribers coming in (sure they are SOME, but I'm sure there are as many who have left their subscriptions run out) , they have to find a way to increase revenue to continue running and DEVELOPING the game, not mention funding their other games.<br />
<br />
Does paying for something like extra character slots suck? Yes, yes it does. <br />
Is paying for something you're not owed, but offered anyway for a reasonable price, fair? Sure is.<br />
<br />
The day they start offering you something that you absolutely have to have to stay competitive in WoW, is the day you should really start making all these dang posts about EVERYTHING Blizzard offers you, be it free or for a small fee.<br />
<br />
Examples would be something like, extra mount speed, increased experience gains, and currency.</div></div><hr />

The increased revenue has nothing to do with continuing to develop the game (keeping up with inflation would be sufficient for that) but is instead about keeping investors interested so that the bubble won't pop.

I strive to remember - and remind others - that Blizzard-Activision remains a partnership that could eventually (and hopefully will) separate. I just hope that when it does happen, it isn't with the same catastrophic results as the Infinity Ward fiasco. It's easy to point out the fact that Bobby Kotick is a person that the entire planet would be better off having shot into the sun, but I've actually met and spoken to the people who develop Blizzard's games. They honestly care about what they are doing, and ENJOY making games. Metzen himself sounds like an excited child when talking about WoW.<br />
<br />
Here's hoping Blizzard doesn't go down in legal flames like Infinity Ward has.<br />
<br />
One of the more interesting posts from your teamliquid.net link was the fact that ATVI (the stock trading symbol for Activision-Blizzard Vivendi) has actually been stagnant for the past year. Where the market has gained overall more than 30% in its steady recovery from the recession, ATVI has traded in a stagnant 10-13$ range. In fact, it's a good $2 lower than it was about 8 months ago. If shareholders don't think Kotick is making them money, hopefully they will have him ousted.</div></div><hr />

- Pay a little fee and start your Character at lvl 60, 70, 80<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Now that would be tempting.<br />
<br />
Tbh what would i appriciate would be if you got char of the same class anywhere on the account on lvl80, you can start that same class at lvl60. That would at least have a reason. But you must somehow take care of all the noobs that are now left in dark 1-60.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Every game would do it just like WoW, if they would be in the position to do so. WoW is the most popular MMO right now. They can charge you for every aspect of it, because people are willing to give their money. Look at LotRo. It'll be free to play in the future. Do you think they do that because they like their customer's so much? They do it because they think in the end they will make more money if they let people play for free and charge them for other stuff like expansions and items from a shop. If they could, they would do it just the way Blizzard does it.</div></div><hr />

MY lowest character is my 50 mage then it is a 62 rogue and then the rest are all 72-80, I wouldn't mind an extra character slot but I don't think I'd pay for it, I mean what is the most I could do? Make a horde character with the same class as my other characters, I don't know it depends.<br />

Also I checked that I would be extremely interested in purchasing extra character slot. <br />
<br />
As of this moment I have full character slots on my realm, 9 classes (lvl 64, 72, 75 thats going to 80 anyday now, rest 80), 1 bank char and I really could use one extra slot for a warlock. Maybe even two slots so I have one free for creating ali char to f.e. promote something on neutral AH or just to be able to create and delete char to refresh the screen, but that would hardly be possible, if they will add a slot, it would probably be just one.<br />
<br />
Also it would depend on the price, if it would be 25 euro I would probably suck it up any buy it, I am not exactly poor but I am a student and... well... I have other things to spend money on too. Making it 10 euro / slot or something would be much friendlier imo, but of I know that it isnt Blizzards goal, money making is.</div></div><hr />

You can only understand if you're an altoholic. I guess some people like levelling as much as others like raiding or pvp. <br />
<br />
Personally I'd have plenty of plans to need more than 10 char slots on my realm. Apart from already having each class, I could use a bank-alt, levelling a feral druid (next to my 80 balance druid), levelling a discipline priest (next to my 80 holy priest) and a future worgen alt.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From recent activity from blizzard a big theory at the moment amoung those in the know is that blizzard want to make WoW a free to play game, where there are no monthly account fees and once you buy the game you can jump on and play as you wish with no worries.<br />
<br />
By placing pets and mounts on the online store, paid name changes, paid transfers, paid faction race changes, etc, they are simply testing the water for alternate ways to make sufficient money to run the servers etc. This means some people will pay a lot less to play WoW and those who want all the extras will probably end up paying more but the choice on how much you pay is all down to you.<br />
<br />
Think about it, how many extra memberships they would get if WoW was free to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Just like the mount they brought out recently an extra character slot will have no impact on the game, people will gain no advantage (except an extra toon with a profession cooldown) so what is the big deal?<br />
<br />
It is funny to read all the &quot;what will be next?&quot; posts though, you do make me smile ;D<br />
<br />
What next? pay a fee and become an end game boss?<br />
What next? pay a fee and be able to teleport to any place on the map<br />
what next? pay a fee and become a GM<br />

&quot;We have a real culture of thrift.

it's kinda wierd just to stack chars cause you can and dont have enough time to play them all, currently im working fulltime and I honestly dont have enough <br />
time to even care about the 3 chars I usually play, so either this hits parents wallets, or make people unemployed for rest of wow, cause honestly if you filled<br />
all slots and you _PLAY_ all (meaning raiding/gearing/pvping) you simply have no time to work/school, or do you keep em as a nostalgia from past expac?<br />
<br />
either way, point is: either your not a dedicated player of your class and your simply holding on to as many chars as possible to not notice you have stopped<br />
liking the game.<br />
<br />
or your simply are a kid playing with very few irl friends.<br />
<br />
(or a rich person with too much sparetime: just for the option to be there)<br />
<br />
this is MY opinion, and not an insult. Just honestly interested in where you get your time to play em all ;)<br />
<br />
Or, like me, you are a person that simply likes leveling a lot and are closing in on 10 level 80s. I'm casual in every sense of the word, including limited playtime, but you can level quite a lot of characters in 5+ years, even with just a few hours a week. I use one main to raid and run heroics with the others. I just play what I feel like on a particular day. Sometimes I play 8 different chars in a week and sometimes I get 'into it' and gear one up for a few weeks. Then I get bored with it and roll another new race/class combination and start over again.<br />
<br />
You seem to think playing means gearing, raiding and/or PvPing, but that's not the case. Altoholics level, which is playing too. Altoholics don't have 10+ level 80 chars to raid on all of them.<br />
<br />
I'd like extra slots for a Goblin and a proper bankalt, or for a few Alliance on my Horde server.</div></div><hr />

I said a few times (on any occasion I saw the &quot;we want extra character slots&quot; topic brought up on the official forums) that is was *inevitable* (given the current modus operandi of Act/Blizz) that extra character slots *will* be brought in...<br />
*at a price* as a (groan) &quot;premium feature&quot;...<br />
(justification once again being &quot;it doesn't impact on play, &amp; is a luxury&quot;)<br />
<br />
Simple (sad) fact of the matter is Act/Blizz will never again include useful upgrades like this for free... when they stand to make more $$$ from them.<br />
The best you can hope for is that they are once off payments &amp; that the cost is kept low.<br />
<br />
Also, no matter how high the QQ will be when this comes in...<br />
rest assured that the number of people who pay for those extra slots will be *massive* (even much greater than the RainbowBrite horse) &amp; Act/Blizz will chuckle to themselves &amp; make their next move (paying for the held back dances for example)... or some kind of (paid for) extra portable bank/bag tab...<br />

I don´t think people at Blizz nor Act care &quot;so much&quot; about the game itself... As you see, their payable fees work. And that means more money for them to do what they want... Get an expensive hooker or something. Money comes first.</div></div><hr />

The only difference is that the oil companies have you by the balls if you MUST drive a car, while you certainly MUST NOT pay for extra character slots or even for WoW)<br />

Threatening to quit or bitching and continuing to play only shows that...you still play. And a company with a game where the next competitor has something like 2 million subs (if at all) will just shrug it off.<br />

Yeah..I'd like that extra slot for free, but as it most like comes at the price of a cinema ticket, I'd still buy it.</div></div><hr />

Earlier this week, a survey was sent to european players to gather data on ... tons of things related to WoW. Hidden among the general WoW questions was a fairly interesting one : <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Apparently, Blizzard is seriously considering offering more character slots to players but you might have to pay for that. Just keep in mind that this is just a survey for the moment and it doesn't accurately reflect what we will or will not get in the future.<br />
<br />
Hahaha xD, my god the greedy bastards, asking money for extra slots. I will NEVER pay for it :) but i know idiots will do :/<br />
<br />
I cannot wait until they bump the subscription price up, as soon as they do that i'm off ^^ and they can watch their little greedy empire dwindle. That has seriously ticked me off &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

People that are new to the MMO industry always stick out. Paying for extra character slots is hardly a new concept and it's a very popular option in other franchises. The fact you think others are idiots for partaking in such a feature leads to one of two conclusions: 1) You're an immature brat that hasn't started working and pulling your own paycheck or 2) You're just just an immature brat.</div></div><hr />

Guild Wars is free to play, you don't have to pay 15 bucks a month and micro transactions on top of it, that's why they're not as problematic.<br />
<br />
Who in their right mind would pay for something that should be provided for free? Blizzard has been well aware of the issues people have had with 10 character slots per server for years. They've dodged it, said it wasn't possible, said they weren't considering it, etc etc every time it was brought up. Now they're considering it, but you're going to have to fork over a few extra dollars? <br />
<br />
Why is everything people are asking for being dropped in the game with a fee. Gone are the days where you paid 15 bucks per month for content that you should be already paying for, where games like DAoC and other MMOs just gave you what the player base wanted* rather than charging you.<br />
<br />
What's next? Probably whatever the people want. Why should they give what the mass majority is asking for, for free, when they can simply charge them and milk all the fools dumb enough to shell out the additional cash. I think the forums are their best asset, contrary to popular belief. Their customers whine about something they'd like to see in game, Blizzard simply sees $$$$$$$$.<br />
<br />
If every good idea is going to have a dollar sign attached to it, then I will never play this game out of principal. I quit it because they seriously broke the game with their crappy ICC, and I watched a friend play all the way to HM LK back in May only to get burnt out and quit. This game, in my opinion, seriously sucks.<br />
<br />
No Cataclysm for me, I keep coming back hoping that they update with news I'd like to hear, but so far it's crap after crap. I could live through their constant reusing skins, such as Molten Core and Blackrock Depths, but why support a company that only cares about making money, Cataclysm is just more of the same.<br />
<br />
*I say wanted because the player base in DAoC back in the early 2000s weren't as sheepish as the WoW community. Everybody is as greedy as Blizzard and think they deserve everything. And why I agree you should pay for luxuries such as Race change, because they really aren't the norm, paying for a service that should be automatically free with a 40 dollar expansion is just brutal.</div></div><hr />

Buying the game and paying the sub assures us that we have 50 character slots, with 10 slots per server. That is a lot more than many games give, and is fairly generous. It's not something Blizzard is doing that nobody else has done before. CoH/CoV has been selling extra character slots for ages now. You don't hear fans of that game SCREAMING that no, they will not pay, and do not believe they should have to pay.<br />
<br />
Most people don't need the slots currently available to them, so I think paying a moderate fee for an extra space or three is fine. I won't utilize the service, but I know people who will. Just like I know people who have paid to faction change, change their name, and even change their appearance.</div></div><hr />

Paying for character slots? So I guess the formula is:<br />
<br />
Give 10 character slots<br />
Make 10 classes<br />
Make content life span short so you're forced to make a bunch of alts<br />
Fill character slots<br />
New race release<br />
Want a new slot for your new race? Pay up !<br />
<br />
I'm sure this case would be the minority, I mean how many people really used all 10 of their character slots that doesnt have a bank alt they can delete? Just saying some people may be in the situation where they have all 10 classes at lvl 80, I know a few people.</div></div><hr />

Remote AH - gimky but I some may like playing the AH while at work or some shit<br />

Vanity pets - meh, not for me, but for those collectable folk maybe so<br />

Mounts?<br />
<br />
Gear next?<br />
<br />
Power level next - buy a pre made lvl 85?<br />
<br />
Gold?<br />
<br />
All options in my eyes. But playing a game with 10 playable races, releasing 2 new playable races and then suggesting people have to pay for the additional slots, sorry, not for me. I'd give a ball back for 2 more slots when Wrath comes out but I shall not be paying for it. £23-30 for an xpac and they cannot give 2 extra slots which must be a piss easy feature to implement????

They are creating new content - new conten, that every noob can handle with. But, they cant just fit the need of the crowd? How 'bout the &quot;elite&quot;? Yeah, they need some of the money to create difficult stuff ... oh wait, no, they dont. Hardmodes! Same content, same gameplay ... more hp/dmg. <br />

Thats the way! Oh, yeah, how about more content? Achivements! Hm, not really new content ... but a way to distract the ppl while milking the cow. A lot of new stuff to feed the needs of the addicted ones. Ppl, who cant realize that wow is getting worse day by day. <br />
Who are still playing this piece of abusing shit. <br />

Its not like other companies cant develop new games cuz they are only selling singleplayer games. Blizzard is selling the games and take a lot of money from you if you want to play it. <br />

I wouldn't pay for an extra character slot, just because I am not interested in it. If you aren't interested in it, don't pay for it. Do I think Blizzard should put an extra slot in for free? Yes, I do. But, if they don't I'm not going to lose sleep over it. I will still play the game and I will still have fun. Their whole system could change to micro-transactions (picture Runes of Magic) and I would have zero problem with it. <br />
<br />
What the do/do not charge for does not effect game play. Nothing that they sell is mandatory. Nothing boosts your DPS or HPS or any stats. Blizzard is a company. Companies want to make money. It's simple. If you don't like it, don't buy it. If you don't like the path they are going down, stop playing (yeah we know that won't happen).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Your last sentence makes it seem like you did not completely understand the concept of buying an additional character slot. For me it looks like you believe that it would be required to buy an extra slot just to play new classes, which is not the case.<br />
<br />
Also (this can't be stretched enough it seems), Blizzard does not seem to have any solid plans for this and there is no guarantee that this will ever be implemented. And to end this post I'd like to mention that we are actually not getting ANY new classes, just new race/class combinations.</div></div><hr />

I wouldn't even consider paying for it. If/when they implement such a feature and actually starts charging for it, I might start considering finding another game to play.

<br />
So am I. I did make a post when the first micro transaction was announced but people waved it away, but this was exactly my point though. You start with a small thing that seems so nice and bonus under the banner indeed of choice and at that time charity as well, which nobody could really complain about, but this evolved more rapidly to an ever growing microtransaction business, including goldselling: for every mount sold they did not only make ridiculous amounts of money but saved the need for fresh alts to pay ~100 gold worth of mounts. It seems insignificant, but so did the first vanity pet that was sold, and now we're at the point where some people, including myself, find it perfectly imaginable that Blizzard will finally release the long awaited dance studio for a premium price - after all, new dances don't affect the gameplay and therefore can be sold with that argument that made them sell so many of those vanity pets and even mount (while, yes, the mountselling business can definitely be said to affect gameplay/economy, as can the vanity pets in term of achievements. Really, it's very difficult to define 'does not affect gameplay'. Nothing doesn't affect gameplay.).<br />
<br />
Why does this seem imaginable? Because Blizzard sticked to 10 character slots ever since Vanilla as far as I'm aware, but since then released 1 new class, 2 new races, and now again will release 2 new races, not to mention making shaman and paladin classes available for both factions since and also making more class/race combinations possible in Cataclysm. Not only can we thus safely say the limit of 10 toons is WAY outdated, but now after the release of yet more races, asking money for more slots is, in my opinion, especially after already paying a monthly fee to be able to play toons in the first place and also just having paid a solid amount of money for the expansion pack, ridiculous. It's a necessity every paying player has a right to, to be able to enjoy the content properly after all those changes, and asking money for what is in my opinion as simple implementation is not only absolutely ridiculous, but mostly disrespectful to their customers.<br />
<br />
I love this game, I really do. It's a company, they're there to make money, but we're essentially employing them because we pay them for their services in return, and therefore we do have rights to ask and expect things for the already rather large fee we pay monthly. One of them is to stop the micro transactions and making all new content available to everyone, including the 8 year old whose parents rightfully think paying 25 dollars for pixels - while they already pay 15 dollar or what is the monthly fee in dollars monthly? - is outrageous. In the end I do believe that too many unattainable content will frustrate players who cannot or do not want to afford it, and create dissatisfaction, which is really a huge shame considering how awesome this game is and how many players have been loving it. <br />

<br />
Edit: I know there's no solid plans, but the fact that the idea alone crossed their minds is infuriating.</div></div><hr />

Anyone know if there's a way of streaming or something similar of that PBS programs in Europe? I would so pay to watch that show!</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) Blizzard is not *doing* anything yet. It's a survey, they're measuring interest. It may well be that there is not much interest and they do nothing. It may well be they're planning to add two spots per server in Cataclysm, but they're curious about what people think for the future. You cannot possibly infer any reasonable conclusions from this other than &quot;Blizzard is curious about whether people are interested in this service&quot;<br />
<br />
2) You are given 50 characters, 10 per server for your 15 bucks a month. It's always been that way, at least as long as I have been playing which is less than a year after release. Let's look at than a minute. Your base playing costs haven't changed in nearly six years of playing. Gas has gone up. Food has gone up. I'm quite certain that Blizzard's costs have gone up. The price of WoW has stayed the same. If you've filled your &quot;barn&quot;, well, frankly... tough. You knew how many stalls the barn had when you built it, but you kept buying horses. Now you see a chance to get a shiny new special horse (Worgen or Goblin breed) and you're complaining to the contractor that he built your barn too small.<br />
<br />
3) They still aren't charging you for anything that you *need* to play the game. To return to the restaurant analogy. You've been going to the same restaurant for 6 years. They charge you $15 for all you can eat and a bottomless glass of tea. Now they're saying, &quot;Hey, we got a liquor license. You can have beer with dinner if you want, but it'll be an extra $3. Oh, and we got a new pastry chef, but her stuff is a little pricier than our usual, so there's a $2 surcharge for her special pastries. Of course the regular buffet still has all the usual stuff, and we're adding stuff to it everyday, all for your normal $15.&quot; For some reason you feel the need to flip out that beer and special pastries aren't included in the regular fee.<br />
<br />
The level of general bitching every time Blizzard releases a new pay service is astounding. News flash guys: &quot;Blizzard makes games for profit.&quot; Preferably more and more profit. They like their houses and electricity and stuff. Now we're to the point of 16 pages of bitching about a service *That doesn't even exist*. It's been vaguely hinted at. *If* this idea generated enough interest to implement, you have no idea what the fee would be, nor how it would work or how many slots you got for the fee. Jesus. Repeat after me: &quot;This service does not exist. This service has not even been announced as something that will exist. This service has not even been mentioned as a possible idea in an obscure blue post.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Back to the main topic...If they make us pay for additional character slots, its more proof that they are going towards a full blown Asian MMO-style cash shop. When they do that, they are going to lose four of their customers (myself, brother, father, and mother).</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they're not. They're adding races, not classes. Whole different ball game.<br />
<br />
In many other games you can buy character slots, why is it such a problem when WoW would do that? I can imagine it's not just for money, but adding extra slots is an extra strain on the servers and databases. It makes a lot of difference if you have to add 2 slots on every server for every account, or just add slots for the people who want them (and will use them).</div></div><hr />

This would be epic! How many of us have a bank char in the middle of to level 80's? :P</div></div><hr />

<br />
If it will bring more load to the servers, they only need to upgrade them I guess. And yes it is a problem, because we are already paying monthly fees, we are paying for each expansion, why should we pay for such nonesense?<br />
<br />
Can someone tell me where the money from our monthly fee goes? What do we get for this money?</div></div><hr />
