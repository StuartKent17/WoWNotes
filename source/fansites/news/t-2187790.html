Patch 7.2 Preview - A Challenging Appearance!<br />
In the recent developer interview (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6422-Developer-Q-A-Matt-Goss-Legion-Itemization), it was revealed that these are going to be very difficult challenges that don't scale with gear.<br />
Artifact Weapons have been proven to be powerful tools against the Burning Legion. With the release of patch 7.2, we are not only adding an Artifact questline to unlock new traits, but we’re also adding a new Artifact challenge appearance. But, you’re going to have to earn it — the hard way.<br />
<br />
‘You Must Be This Tall’<br />
To be able to take on the challenge before you and earn your new Artifact appearance, you’re going to need to meet a few requirements first. You must be level 110, purchase all 35 of the ranks for your Artifact weapon, and complete the questline to unlock access to the four new traits available with patch 7.2.<br />
<br />
A Towering Achievement<br />
Returning to the Broken Shore has a lot to offer including new structures that open additional benefits for those adventuring through the island. For those who plan to earn their Challenge Appearance the Mage Tower is going to be an important building to invest your Legionfall War Supplies in. When the tower is active and you’ve met all of the requirements, a new quest will become available to you. This quest is a continuation of your Class Order campaign and will ask you to take care of a little unfinished business via a solo encounter. You’ll need to face a powerful foe to earn your new appearance — but it’s not going to be easy.<br />
<br />
This encounter will provide players with the opportunity to show their mastery of their class with a solo skill challenge. There are 7 different challenges available which are tailored to your class role. Each role’s challenge will vary slightly whether it’s healing a group of support npcs, tanking and keeping your group npcs from being killed, or straight dps to kill the boss. There’s no gear requirement, but you’re going to want to invest in getting the best gear you possibly can if you’re going to walk out of the encounter with a brand-new look for your weapon.<br />
<br />
The Cost of Success<br />
The first time you get the quest, you’ll be able to enter the encounter for free. If you fail—and there’s a good chance you will—the next (and the next) time is going to cost. If you’ve been active within the Broken Shore, you’ll have started to accumulate Nethershards. You can use these Nethershards to purchase additional chances at the encounter. The Mage Tower is active for three days before it’s destroyed, so time is limited. If you’re determined to give it a good run each time the tower is available, you might want to spend some time under the shadow of the Sentinax to gather as many Nethershards as you can. Success with earning your Artifact weapon’s Challenge Appearance is going to cost — but bragging rights will be yours when you do succeed.<br />

<br />
Get the Look<br />
These appearances have been inspired by previous class questlines that led to weapons like Anathema/Benediction, and Rhok’delar. No grouping is required—or allowed—and completing the challenge will reward a truly distinctive appearance.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tygerman</div><div class="date">2017-03-21, 07:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think this will be a good addition to Legion. It could give some people another reason to come back to the game (could be wishful thinking). People have been wanting good solo content for some time now (in an MMO, which is weird but I'm ok with) and I think this is a good compromise. It provides a good reward (which is subjective of course) and could give casual players a decent challenge they can work towards that doesn't involve a large time commitment or raiding.<br />
<br />
This could also provide a way for people to get into Alts that have been ignored this expansion. For example, I don't play many alts, but because of these new skins I will be playing other characters to get the additional skin, namely the Guardian Druid skin. Not only is that druid skin the craziest thing I've seen added to the game, but I will look forward to future expansions when I can say that I did this challenge and have something &quot;unobtainable&quot;.<br />
<br />
As someone that has played since TBC, yet didn't really get into the game until MoP, I don't have anything that's really unobtainable anymore apart from the MoP and WoD legendary items, so this definitely has my attention as I'm always looking to expand my collection (BMAH or regular AH items). The cost per attempt system also reminds me that every attempt counts, and that I should only try for it if I'm ready, although if Nethershards are easily farmable in 7.2 it won't matter so much.<br />
<br />
TLDR: Optimistic of the system, hope they don't change it too much when 7.2 goes live.<br />
<br />
Edit: Someone mentioned the Green Fire quest for Warlocks in MoP, and heard that once you got enough gear it became a cakewalk, so looking at the phrase &quot;Doesn't scale with gear&quot; does concern me to some extent. But I suppose if you're good enough to get heroic raiding gear, you should be somewhat good enough to get these skins anyways.</div></div><hr />

<br />
We all know that this grind is just reason for monthly sub so gating like limited tries per week should be fine. Seriosly just lock it like 2-3 tries per week. There's no real reason to lock it behind mindless nethershard grind.<br />

<br />
Well that's heavily depends on POV. It maybe good for you, old player, but it's bad for MMO-health in general IMO.<br />
<br />
Let's imagine new player, he meets some veteran in awesome armor...<br />
- Hey, your armor is so awesome where did you get it?<br />
- Blah-bla-blah<br />
- Oh it's unavailable? :(<br />
...<br />
- Oh another person on awesome mount, where did you get it?<br />
- Blah-bla-blah<br />
- Oh it's unavailable? :(<br />
... repeat many times<br />
- DAMN, SCREW THIS SHITTY GAME WHERE I CAN'T GET ANYTHING COOL!!!!<br />
(deletes wow)<br />
<br />
A bit exagerrated scenario of course but perfectly viable when you delete everything after expansion ends.</div></div><hr />

By unique, you mean lucky ... like all the Vanilla stuff that made you feel unique, sorry - I mean lucky.<br />

The cool thing about these new quests is that getting them or not will only depend on you - no more raid carries to glory like vanilla -&gt; LK etc.</div></div><hr />

So, after this korean-style grind expac there is another reason not to come back.<br />

Wait, what? Your comment seems very contradictory. You like that you have stuff that can't be acquired anymore, but the killing point for you is that you won't be able to get stuff that's going to, maybe, be made unavailable in a future xpac? What?</div></div><hr />

We all know that this grind is just reason for monthly sub so gating like limited tries per week should be fine. Seriosly just lock it like 2-3 tries per week. There's no real reason to lock it behind mindless nethershard grind.<br />

Or get good and do it without taking tons of tries :^)</div></div><hr />

It makes players feel awesome and gives them something that makes them feel unique.<br />
<br />
You get unique by combining things your own way. If you need exclusive things to feel special, then I suggest that you work on your self-esteem instead.<br />
<br />
If anything, your special snowflake status is pampered when you get something earlier than others.<br />
<br />
And just to clarify - I got the MoP CM birds and one of the class sets (being too late to the party after a long burnout break), I could have got an original Amani bear if I had better luck on rolls, and I have Benediction/Anathema on my priest.<br />
<br />
Things should be available to all players besides some temporary promotions. I get that titles for special achievements are exclusive - like the warlock title for the green fire quest (which I also got btw), but other things should stay. If anything, it keeps people occupied and paying subs...<br />

<br />
Since these &quot;challenges&quot; probably won't be balanced equally for all specs, you will probably have to overgear some to make it work. <br />
<br />
Temporary access to this challenges are very bad, though. As if burning gold with repair costs and consumables is not enough...<br />

Really odd IMO.<br />
<br />
Also, is only makes them &quot;special&quot; for a very limited time, cause after some time the gear will be trivialized and everyone can do them. So it effects everyone in a negative way. Bragging rights? Not really, first only high end raiders will have them, then everyone will. <br />
<br />
Maybe I'm just mad since I'm not a raider and was really looking forward to the new Guardian druid form. I always loved doing scaled solo challenges like proving grounds/green fire Q. This was bad news for me :(</div></div><hr />

So with the sindori bite with aupremecy it has a 3 minute cooldoen for odvious reasons. And it tells you it does. But once you remove supremecy the cooldown disappears. So you think it would pair amazingly with willfreds band. But fucki g nope. It has a hidden cooldown.<br />

Same principle with the warlock green fire quest I guess? Mind you even with good gear it was still fairly challenging. It really depends on how things will work.</div></div><hr />

By that logic, nothing with the (exception of Proving Grounds) is challenging because they don't scale with gear. It is no different from the rewards you get from mid expansion mythics.</div></div><hr />

Okay, nice logic. IRL, you want to get a promotion because of your gear scale ? lel.<br />
Challenges can and SHOULD even in video game imply BRAIN. Is this something you know ? If you make an encounter using some very enigmatic or kind of IQ challenges, it could be fun for some type of players. Obviously this could be the contrary for others but &quot;challenges&quot; isn't only and shouldn't be brainless.<br />

Not exaggerated. It is what people start their Nostalgia threads with. &quot;Remember how people would inspect you and be in awe&quot;. Hey, Blizzard listened ^^<br />

On the other hand, I guess all the crying over how gear and luck with Legendaries, and TF not skill gets you the kill then ends in a hard quest that cannot be outgeared. Hey, Blizzard listened again!<br />

<br />
How dare they have content that isn't guaranteed success for everyone?<br />
<br />
Players who hate grinds so much shouldn't play MMOs anyway. Or thinking that any sort of exclusive reward is inherently bad because 6 years later you can't oneshot a boss and receive a mount that actually held some sort of prestige once. And yes, prestige is important in MMOs and trying to deny it is pointless. You feel good for having an awesome weapon or mount few others have and being the forum white knight and claiming otherwise isn't going to change how the human mind works. And there's a difference between once standing in ironforge and going insane over someones full t2 set, and defending the fact that being able to achieve something not everyone can just waltz into and oneshot in an hour is important for MMO players at some level.<br />
<br />
Now I don't know how challenging this will end up being, but at least I can see the benefits of this kind of system. If it's not available forever, some people are going to do whatever it takes to get it. But it's not just a &quot;Reset and try again for free&quot; system, and if every attempt is expensive you'll actually feel like your attempt has something on the line as well.<br />
<br />
In short: Guaranteed success and zero investment is the bane of fun.</div></div><hr />

Monks are also the only class that all weapons sheathe on your back, what is the point of having such a feature if you've got a fist weapon forced down your throat the entire expansion? I simply don't care about another fist weapon skin, it's unappealing but if we go by your logic, we shouldn't be using weapons at all.</div></div><hr />

Dude, there a thing that you are not triggered about? You seem to be pissed like 99% of your time here. I don't think WoW is healthy for you, to be honest.<br />
<br />
As for challenges, there is one for each spec or just 7 different? They could tune it better if we would had each for one specific spec. Anyway, I will do it only on my main and wait for 7.3/7.3.5 catch up gear for my alts.</div></div><hr />

Good thing it's optional then isn't it? You know since it's a cosmetic appearance. All you really need to do is the questline for the traits. I imagine the appearance is something separate.<br />
<br />
And even so god forbid you have to put effort in towards a video game these days right?</div></div><hr />

I think you do misunderstand that nobody is forcing people to play the game (and that's not what is being discussed because it's obvious, everything is optional in the game) and players would rather have fun than &quot;put effort in towards a video game&quot;. Sure a challenge can be fun, all right. Farming uninteresting content to reach said challenge (that is gated behind nethershards farming) ? Not that interesting.</div></div><hr />

Then don't do it. I won't for an optional cosmetic either. Also uninteresting is entirely down to subjective opinion.</div></div><hr />

Yep it's subjective but it's an opinion obviously shared by a lot of players.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">FelPlague</div><div class="date">2017-03-21, 10:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This thread in a nutshell:<br />
<br />
How dare they have content that isn't guaranteed success for everyone?<br />
<br />
Players who hate grinds so much shouldn't play MMOs anyway. Or thinking that any sort of exclusive reward is inherently bad because 6 years later you can't oneshot a boss and receive a mount that actually held some sort of prestige once. And yes, prestige is important in MMOs and trying to deny it is pointless. You feel good for having an awesome weapon or mount few others have and being the forum white knight and claiming otherwise isn't going to change how the human mind works. And there's a difference between once standing in ironforge and going insane over someones full t2 set, and defending the fact that being able to achieve something not everyone can just waltz into and oneshot in an hour is important for MMO players at some level.<br />
<br />
Now I don't know how challenging this will end up being, but at least I can see the benefits of this kind of system. If it's not available forever, some people are going to do whatever it takes to get it. But it's not just a &quot;Reset and try again for free&quot; system, and if every attempt is expensive you'll actually feel like your attempt has something on the line as well.<br />
<br />
In short: Guaranteed success and zero investment is the bane of fun.<br />
<br />
dont forget the &quot;wtf this is no where near worth it, i will never do it, they all lok shit not worth time&quot; When in reality cause they're bad and wont be able to</div></div><hr />

If I recall players were crying previously about welfare legendaries and everything being handed to them on a plate. Here is your solution. Grinds are supposed to take time and effort.</div></div><hr />

not really, 20 people on mmochamp who are in an angry mood so they are more likley to share their opinions is not &quot;alot&quot;<br />
<br />
idk if you know phsyiology<br />
but people are MUCH more likley to talk about something that angers them, and to seek out others who agree, and tell people about it, then those who like something<br />
<br />
when you enjoy your time at a restaurant you are less likley to leave a review or thank the chef<br />
then when you hate your time and complain or leave a bad review<br />

<br />
also getting them isnt even a grind its<br />
<br />
be good<br />
or come back at near the end of the expansion and be ready for a grind<br />
and those good players will get them first and get to show them off</div></div><hr />

<br />
You recall wrong. People were complaining about a) RNG in legendaries, you can basically get BiS for minimal efforts if you're lucky and never see them if unlucky rather than being handed after a relevant FUN questline and b) people didn't ask for more grind but rather for more content. More content doesn't equate to more grind. But I m confident at this point you re only trolling because your post only has limited relevance compared to what I posted before (I don't even know why you're talking about legendaries here). <br />
<br />
Nobody ever asked for more grind. Grinds were always the reason why MMORPG were so unpopular before WoW.<br />

No, if you really don't enjoy a restaurant you just leave and even ask for a refund, just as many of players did in wow since blizzard comes up with such clunky game design. I don't even see why people would grind useless and tedious content in wow when such amazing games are being released currently.<br />
<br />
Also, the right word you re looking for is psychology, not physiology.</div></div><hr />

Well, thankfully Legion removed literally all need for grinding and where are all these amazing games ?<br />
I've yet to find one that comes close to WoW?<br />
If there are so many, why couldn't you even mention a few ?<br />
<br />
<br />

Physiology is about if your body can handle 16 hours video gaming straight<br />
Psychology is about why the hell are you playing 16 hours video gaming :)</div></div><hr />

btw you can qoute me or mention me so i know you responded<br />
and again, you dont seem to understand<br />
more people are likley to call over the waiter and say &quot;our food is shit, refund us&quot;<br />
instead of calling over the waiter and saying &quot;our food is amazing, heres your tip&quot;<br />
(not just for money reason)<br />
<br />
because people are much more willing to go out of their way to do something angry, then to do something happy<br />
also what games? you list &quot;such amazing games&quot; but then list none, what are these amazing mmo RPG with a cartoony style that has content like wow?<br />
<br />
also yes i was looking for psychology, fucking auto correct</div></div><hr />

That's simply not true, I do live in france and we do have a lot of very good restaurants over here and I can guarantee you that if a restaurant is good a) people would praise the chief b) give a tip and c) talk about it (and the oposite is true in equal quantity). <br />
<br />
The &quot;vocal minority&quot; argument is a marketing bullshit point that video games companies usually make when they come up with flawed design and try to mitigate the backlash.<br />
<br />

Please stay in the same genre...<br />

Well, if Legion with literally ZERO grind required is the worst, that says a lot for the WoW team over the last 8 years.<br />
