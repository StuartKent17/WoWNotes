The fearsome death knight, World of Warcraft’s first Hero class, is not your average adventurer seeking to prove his or her worth on Azeroth’s fields of battle. No longer servants of the Lich King, they begin their new calling as experienced, formidable adversaries, heavily armed and armored and possessing an arsenal of deadly and forbidden magic learned in the Lich King’s thrall. Here is an introduction, subject to change, of some of the death knight’s core gameplay mechanics and abilities:<br />
<br />
Unlocking and Creating the Death Knight<br />
Simply have a character of at least level 55 on the World of Warcraft account you play, and you will be able to create a new level-55 death knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the death knight must be the same faction as your existing character). Upon entering the world, your neophyte death knight will undertake a series of quests designed to teach you your new abilities. You will be able to create one death knight per realm, per account.<br />
<br />
Class Roles<br />
Tank: The plate-wearing death knight is a capable tank for small groups as well as raids. His or her damage output while tanking will be respectable.<br />
DPS: The death knight can also spec and gear for a melee DPS role, which will draw upon many debilitating disease effects as well as direct damage and instant attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent Trees<br />
Death knight talent trees are complemented by Presences -- self-only auras that benefit the death knight. Selecting the matching Presence for each tree augments the class abilities for that school of magic.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/may/b_blood.gif Blood: Talents in this tree focus on damage-dealing abilities. Blood Presence increases damage output by a percentage.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/may/b_frost.gif Frost: Talents in this tree focus on tanking abilities. Frost Presence increases threat and lowers damage taken by a percentage.<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/may/b_unholy.gif Unholy: Talents in this tree have a variety of functions including summons, diseases, and PvP-focused abilities. Unholy Presence increases attack speed and reduces the global cooldown on death knight abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The Rune System<br />
The resource mechanics for death knights are runes and runic power. A skilled death knight makes efficient, timely use of runes and runic power to maximize his or her damage-dealing or tanking abilities.<br />
Runes: Every death knight ability requires runes, which come in three varieties: blood, frost, and unholy. Depending on the ability, it may require runes of a single type or a combination of types. When a rune is used, it has a cooldown period before it can be used again. Death knights can customize which array of six runes to have available at a given time, which can aid their ability to perform certain roles. For example, a tanking death knight may wish to load his or her rune array with more Frost runes.<br />
Runic Power: As rune abilities are used, the death knight also generates another resource called runic power. The death knight will have certain abilities that consume all available runic power, with varying levels of effectiveness based on total runic power spent. Similar to a warrior’s rage, runic power decays over time if not spent.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Summoned Creatures<br />
Creating minions from the ranks of the unliving is a core ability of the death knight.<br />
Raise Dead: The death knight can raise a ghoul companion from the corpses of fallen creatures, as well as those of both friendly and enemy players. If cast on a friendly player, that player will have the opportunity to actually play as the ghoul, controlling its movements and actions.<br />
Army of the Dead: This channeled spell raises a group of undead followers who will attack the death knight’s enemies but only exist very briefly before disintegrating.<br />
Summon Deathcharger: Every death knight can summon the level-40 version of a deathcharger land mount. At higher levels, they can complete a quest to learn the epic version.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
WotLK - New Gameplay Features<br />
Like The Burning Crusade before it, Wrath of the Lich King will be an expansion in the truest sense of the word. Not happy with just adding a landmass bigger than Outland, new dungeons with fresh loot, and an army of new monsters, the design team is also introducing brand-new gameplay mechanics to make the game world more accessible, more alive, and even more fun. Read on to find out more about some of the many gameplay changes going into World of Warcraft: Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
Paradigm Shift: Dungeons and Raids in Wrath of the Lich King<br />
Heroic dungeons were one of the most popular innovations of the previous expansion, so it’s no surprise Heroic mode will return in Wrath of the Lich King. Just as in The Burning Crusade, every five-person dungeon will have a Heroic variant that will present players with an added challenge and improved rewards.<br />
<br />
One exciting new feature in Wrath of the Lich King is that all raid content will be available as either a 10- or 25-person dungeon with completely independent progression paths. Both the 10- and 25-person versions will be the same dungeon; the look, layout, and design of the dungeon will remain the same. However, each will be adjusted, tuned, and balanced for its respective player size. <br />
<br />
In Wrath of the Lich King, players can expect both 10- and 25-person raid progression paths to get increasingly difficult as they adventure to their final battle with Arthas. This new gameplay mechanic will allow more players to enjoy the raid content of Wrath of the Lich King in their preferred play style. Because it takes more effort to get 25 people together than it does for 10, players who participate in the 25-person raid progression path will receive higher quality and more loot than those who play the 10-person versions.<br />
<br />
In addition, players will never be required to attune in a 10-person raid to progress to a 25-person raid in the progression path. Raid lockouts are same-size as well, so joining a 25-person raid for a dungeon will not lock a player out from the 10-person version of the same dungeon. This freedom of choice between raid-progression paths will let personal preference play a much bigger role in how players experience the raid content of Wrath of the Lich King.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Quest Mechanics<br />
The quest designers are hard at work to make sure that the road to level 80 will be paved with quests unlike anything you’ve ever seen before. The Burning Crusade innovated with bombing runs and daily quests, and Wrath of the Lich King will continue this trend with still more unique and varied adventures to undertake.<br />
<br />
Just one example of the new mechanics you can expect from the expansion is the new vehicle-based content, which puts an interesting spin on some of the concepts originally developed for PvP siege gameplay. Certain types of vehicles and mounts can now carry passengers, making it possible for players to, for example, break a prisoner out of a tightly guarded compound by attempting a daring escape on horseback. While the NPC steers the horse, the player lobs explosives at a pack of pursuing worgen. In another quest, the roles are reversed as the player takes to the skies in a flying machine to track down and rescue survivors of a catastrophic event. Even beyond the ability for vehicles to hold passengers, Wrath of the Lich King introduces an aerial combat system that will add a new dimension to gameplay. <br />

(if on a PvP realm, the death knight must be the same faction as your existing character).<br />

<br />
Adding Shamans to alliance and Paladins to horde with TBC wasn't that different really. And that worked out alright.<br />
<br />
TBH all the announcements so far have really been to 'hype up' the new class. Some of the abilities sound impressive, but may well be really underpowered. I'm certainly not expecting the death knight to be some kind of uber class that completely negates the need for any other characters. The complete opposite, actually. I expect the DK to be pretty much a failure. A lot of the abilities seem quite novel, and may be useful for PvP. But from what's been announced I see nothing to give them raid utility, with the possible exception of rezzing fallen friends as ghouls, if it can be done in combat.</div></div><hr />

[b]Unlocking and Creating the Death Knight<br />
Simply have a character of at least level 55 on the World of Warcraft account you play, and you will be able to create a new level-55 death knight of any race (if on a PvP realm, the death knight must be the same faction as your existing character). <br />
<br />
<br />
So that means if I'm on a PvE server and want to make my Tauren (Horde) Warrior a Death Knight, I can turn him into a race of the opposite faction. So switch faction?</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No. You do not convert existing characters into a death knight. On a PvE server, once any character reaches level 55, that allows you to create a new character, of any race and faction, which is a level 55 death knight.<br />
On a PvP server, if you reach level 55 as alliance, you can only create an alliance death knight, and vice versa.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Girlyman</div><div class="date">2008-05-21, 02:12 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What a mess.<br />
<br />
Once you hit 55 with any chars, or you got any of your chars past 55, the Death Knight Class will be unlocked.<br />
<br />
Select Faction ( Horde/Alliance) - &gt; Select Race - &gt; Select DK as class<br />
<br />
On PvP servers you can ONLY create chars from 1 faction, if your char is Horde, you can't create an Ally on that SAME server. But you can delete/transfer ALL your chars on that server and start over as a member of the other faction.<br />
<br />
On PvE servers you can have chars from both Factions. <br />
<br />
------------------<br />
http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/info/basics/realmtypes.html<br />
<br />
<br />
Pve: You can create both Alliance and Horde characters (but they won't be able to send mail or otherwise interact with each other).<br />
<br />
PvP: You can create only Alliance or only Horde characters on a Player vs. Player realm - not both.</div></div><hr />

Does that mean that I can create a DK on any server I want, but only x1?<br />
<br />
I mean, so I can have one that server, another on that one... Just so on, or how is it?<br />
<br />
(Give Heroic Character slot...)<br />
<br />
<br />
heres what that means<br />
<br />
say you have server a, b, and c.<br />
<br />
server A you have a level 70 undead and server b you have a level 70 night elf, server c you have a level 38 night elf<br />
<br />
on server a, you can make a deathknight. on server b, you can as well.<br />
<br />
on server c, you can not because you do not have a 55+ on that realm.<br />
<br />
one deathknight per realm that you have a 55+ on.<br />
<br />
in my case, i have a 58 druid on boulderfist, a 70 priest on emerald dream, and a 70 warrior on the underbog. i can make 3 deathknights, one on each server.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Girlyman</div><div class="date">2008-05-21, 11:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">* In order to unlock this class, a player must have a character at level 55. The Death Knights (as of now) will be completing specific quests tailored for them when they first start out that will explain the character's defection, etc. They will start off in a floating necropolis in the EPL, then do quests in their own (new) area within EPL that will explain the mechanics and storyline. <br />
<br />
* Current plans are that once you unlock your Death Knight you can create one per realm across all realms (even those you do not have characters on) per account.<br />
<br />
<br />
If you have two accounts on your name, you can have 1 DK on server A with acc1, and another 1 on the same realm with acc2.<br />

<br />
<br />
This is wrong.<br />
<br />
If you have a character of level 55 or above, you can create a Death Knight on any server.<br />
You may not create them over faction boundaries on PvP servers. If you have no character on the selected PvP realm you are free to choose either faction.<br />
You may not have more than one Death Knight per realm on one account.<br />
<br />
After you have one character of at least level 55 you can create Death Knights on any server, but you can only have one on each realm.</div></div><hr />

Probably won't. Blizzard would be dumb not to have thought of this. Though I Have a question: I know you only can have 1 death knight per realm, per account. But how will it be if i might so happen to delete this DK, will i be able to choose a different server to make a DK on. If so, it would be quite cool.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So you delete 1 DK, and make one on another server? Can't you make one on every server as long as you have a 55+ char? So no need to delete then..</div></div><hr />

One DK per server per account. You don't have to delete a DK on Server X to make one on Server Y. All you need is an existing lvl 55 toon on Server Y to make one. The only time you'd have to delete a DK is if you're on a PvE server and you decide you want to play one on the opposite faction instead.</div></div><hr />

300 caps at 55 :p<br />
<br />
And ofcource you'll have to level professions from 1 , you'd think they would give everybody two free professions at almost max level?<br />
<br />
That would blow up the server echonomy entirely.</div></div><hr />

No.<br />
<br />
You people are just.....dense beyond belief sometimes.<br />
<br />
If you have 1 character on your account, a level 56 whatever on server A, you can now make 1 deathknight on each of the following: Server A, Server B, Server C, Server D, Server E, etc.</div></div><hr />

So if i got it right now, i can make as many DK's i want, if only i got one char at lvl 55+ at any server? Well this confuses me after what i've read at wow-europe.com, they said 1 dk, per server, per account (which means only 1 dk on any server. There can only exist 1 dk on your account.) Am i right ? Well the question still was if i deleted my dk, could i make it on another server?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Brand new level 55 character placed in Eastern Plaguelands (tentatively). There is no conversion of of an existing character required, merely possession of an existing character of a minimum level of 55 on the server you wish to play your Death Knight in.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Read the official news. a minimum level 55 character is required to unlock the DK but it only unlocks the DK for the server that existing toon in. Blizzard is not going to chance the likelihood of players attempting to steam roll brand new and underpopulated servers with Death Knights that have lvl 55+ mains on other servers. <br />
<br />
You call me dense yet you're the one who clearly fails at critical reading.</div></div><hr />
