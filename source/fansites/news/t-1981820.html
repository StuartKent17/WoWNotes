Legion - Artifact Lore<br />
In Legion, each artifact has some lore and story in the class hall Artifact book. Most are currently placeholders, but the Fire Mage one appears to be implemented.<br />

Felo'melorn. Flamestrike. Sword of kings. Bane of trolls. Its legend stretches back through the millennia. It stands as a symbol of hope, loss, and power-of destruction and renewal. <br />
<br />
Those who have wielded Felo'melorn have forever etched their names into history. Will you do the same? <br />
<br />
Part 1<br />
Though it is not known for certain, rumors that have passed down through generations suggest that a young Dath'Remar Sunstrider, who would one day become king of the high elves, dreamed of the weapon Felo'melorn. In that dream, the arcane blade burned like the sun and dispatched so many enemies that it created a swift-flowing river of blood.<br />
<br />
Dath'Remar would later recount the specifics of the blade's appearance to the renowned magesmith Luminarian as he crafted the weapon on his arcane forge. <br />
<br />
Part 2 <br />
From the personal writings of Serena Everwind, night elf priestess during the War of the Ancients: <br />
<br />
&quot;Dath'Remar wielded Felo'melorn, Flamestrike, like an elf possessed. He was an unstoppable force, at once majestic and graceful yet savage and deadly. The runes of the blade seemed to pulse in rhythm with the pounding of Dath'Remar's fierce heart as he separated limb from body and head from shoulders.<br />
<br />
&quot;When the fighting was done, Dath'Remar stood painted in demon blood. As night fell, we knew that more battles remained, and yet, with this elf and this blade among us, we held out hope that victory did not lie beyond our grasp.&quot;<br />
<br />
Part 3 <br />
In the hands of Anasterian Sunstrider, great-grandson of the high elf king Dath'Remar, Felo'melorn became a legendary troll-killer.<br />
<br />
Among the trolls, whispers spread of a spellbound blade, empowered by arcane magic not only to slay the most formidable and cunning of its enemies, but also to cut through superior numbers and irrigate battlefields with their blood.<br />
<br />
Troll witch doctors set about casting hexes and curses against the infamous weapon, but history bears out that even the darkest voodoo did little to negate the effectiveness of Felo'melorn during the Troll Wars.<br />
<br />
Part 4 <br />
An account of the battle between the death knight Arthas and Anasterian Sunstrider during the attack on Quel'Thalas, from the personal writings of the former priestess Liadrin: <br />
<br />
&quot;All fighting came to a halt. Silence fell over the battlefield. I watched from a distance, helpless as the former prince Arthas cast a spell freezing Anasterian in a coat of ice. The king cast a counterspell, freeing himself as the death knight advanced. Felo'melorn and Frostmourne met, the strident clash of their impact rolling out over the ice and across the blood-drenched tiles. <br />
<br />
&quot;The force of their meeting cleaved Felo'melorn, Flamestrike, in half. Arthas's swing continued, severing the right leg of our aged, beloved king. Even as Anasterian dropped to his remaining knee, he struck out, burying his broken blade in the death knight's thigh. Arthas whirled Frostmourne up, over, and down, thrusting it to the hilt behind Anasterian's collarbone and deep into his chest. <br />
<br />
Part 5 <br />
Excerpt from the journal of Lor'themar Theron, concerning Prince Kael'thas's return in the immediate wake of Quel'Thalas's destruction: <br />
<br />
&quot;Our fallen king, Anasterian, lay upon a table in the tavern hall; his broken blade, Felo'melorn, rested upon his chest, the two pieces joined. I told our prince that the weapon had been shattered in the battle with the death knight Arthas. <br />
<br />
&quot;Kael'thas walked to his father's body and ran his finger over the fracture, remarking that he did not believe it possible for Flamestrike's blade to be sundered.<br />
<br />
&quot;I was left wondering what legacy, if any, awaited our people and the legendary blade that now symbolized not strength or dominance, but fallibility.&quot;<br />
<br />
Part 6 <br />
In the time following the devastating Scourge attack on Quel'Thalas, Prince Kael'thas renamed the high elf survivors the sin'dorei, or blood elves. While the prince and a band of blood elves assisted the human troops of Grand Marshal Garithos against the remaining undead forces, it was rumored that Kael'thas kept the pieces of his father's sword, Felo'melorn, on a sideboard in his dilapidated quarters.<br />
<br />
Kael'thas dreamed of making Flamestrike's blade whole again so that it might serve once more as a symbol of hope, to show his people that even in the face of overwhelming hardship, the blood elves would not be broken.<br />
<br />
Part 7 <br />
In time, Prince Kael'thas Sunstrider realized his dream of rejoining the broken pieces of Felo'melorn. <br />
<br />
It is said that the sword was reforged with &quot;magic, and hatred, and a burning need for revenge.&quot; <br />
<br />
There are some who speculate that the sword was taken to a descendant of Luminarian, the magesmith who originally created the weapon on his legendary arcane forge before the War of the Ancients. This assertion has never been independently verified.<br />
<br />
Part 8 <br />
An account of Kael'thas Sunstrider's battle with the death knight Arthas, from the personal writings of Kael'thas: <br />
<br />
&quot;The death knight charged, his blade, Frostmourne, arcing down. I blocked with my staff, but it was no use; the stave shattered. It was then that I revealed my surprise... <br />
<br />
&quot;Felo'melorn. Flamestrike, mended, made whole once again. It burned with righteous fury as our two swords clashed. Each of us held steady, blades pressed tight. I smiled and asked Arthas if he remembered Felo'melorn. <br />
<br />
&quot;He snidely replied that he saw it snap beneath Frostmourne in the instant before he slew my father. When he shoved me back, I told him that I had found the blade, had it reforged... <br />
<br />
&quot;'Broken swords are weak where they are mended, elf,' the despicable former prince said. <br />
<br />
&quot;'Human swords, perhaps,' I replied. And I knew... that day I knew this one thing at least: I might not win, but Felo'melorn would not be broken again.<br />
<br />
&quot;Filled with renewed purpose, I attacked.&quot;<br />
<br />
Part 9 <br />
From the journal of Lyandra Sunstrider, distant relative of King Anasterian: &quot;Today, at last, my efforts to uncover the location of my birthright have borne fruit. &quot;It is now made known to me that the sword of my ancestors, Felo'melorn, Flamestrike, resides within the Lich King's stronghold of Icecrown Citadel.<br />
<br />
&quot;It was there that the blade was taken to after leaving the possession of the traitor Kael'thas Sunstrider.<br />
<br />
&quot;At last, I shall validate my claim to the Sunstrider throne. I shall seek out Flamestrike, and I shall realize my destiny.&quot;<br />
<br />
Part 10 <br />
Last journal entry of Lyandra Sunstrider, distant relative of King Anasterian: <br />
<br />
&quot;Icecrown Citadel, I curse your name. <br />
<br />
&quot;Along empty halls I made my way, through a twisting labyrinth of black saronite, until I beheld a warm, red glow pouring from a room at the end of a dismal passage.<br />
<br />
&quot;I entered and saw... Felo'melorn. Flamestrike, mounted upon a dais. At last, the sword that would solidify my claim to the Sunstrider throne! I approached, awestruck, reached out... &quot;And the door slammed shut behind me. The prize I had so long sought was at last within my grasp... <br />
<br />
&quot;But now... I am trapped. Surely death awaits me. Or perhaps... something worse.&quot;<br />
<br />
Part 11 <br />
Excerpt from a speech given by Aethas Sunreaver: <br />
<br />
&quot;My brothers, in the time since the Sunreavers' expulsion from the Kirin Tor, we have endeavored to secure readmission. I tell you now that the key to our salvation exists... It exists within the frozen black halls of Icecrown Citadel, in the possession of a fallen elf-Lyandra Sunstrider. <br />
<br />
&quot;She dwells there now as a reanimated shell of her former self, but I have learned that it is Lyandra who holds the infamous blade of kings, Felo'melorn. Flamestrike. It has been trusted to remain in her keeping by the Lich King himself, to aid in battle against the Legion. Lyandra was obsessed with the blade while she was among the living, and when she ventured to Icecrown to claim it, that obsession proved to be her downfall. However, Lyandra's tragic misstep provides us with an opportunity... <br />
<br />
&quot;An opportunity for the Sunreavers to retake our rightful place... among the Kirin Tor!&quot;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;<br />

Holy Paladin Feedback -- Build 21466 -- 13-Apr<br />
Next build should fix two bugs regarding Aura of Sacrifice, although we can't be certain if they're what caused your issue, so please let us know if it keeps happening.<br />
--For a while the spell has correctly worked if it absorbed 2 simultaneous damage events, only letting one of them damage you to the threshold. That wasn't working correctly if you took more than 2--such as in a large instantaneous raidwide AoE--which should be fixed now.<br />
--It should no longer kill you if it absorbs a large damage event at the exact moment Divine Shield fades.<br />
<br />
There's one other known issue regarding players of different levels, but that should not significantly impact testing.

Just remove Enslave Demon. IDK what warranted the heavy slap, but a lv55 max on the spell is ridiculous. Just remove it.<br />
Enslave Demon, and other similar abilities (like Bribe), will be usable on targets up to your level +1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/718251866245742594))<br />

Just because ability isn't rotation doesn't make it worth removing. Camo as a talent. No instance CC as MM. No Deterrence.<br />
Marks does have instant CC (Bursting Shot), and does have Deterrence (Aspect of the Turtle). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/718546300309016577))<br />
Instant 4s CC not the same as &quot;CC that target so we can kill the rest&quot;. 30% reduced damage(still can't attack) not immunity.<br />
Aspect of the Turtle is literally Deterrance in functionality when pressed. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/718547759784177664))<br />

do you foresee outlaw rogues recasting roll the bones in PvE when they only get jolly roger (healing buff) and is that OK?<br />
Yes, and that's okay. When soloing, the healing, in conjunction with the artifact ability, should be quite useful. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/718256726164824065))<br />

<br />
You still need to visit a transmog vendor, and your transmog is not saved per slot, it's per piece. Meaning that during leveling you can't use transmogs because you'll be replacing your gear all the time, resetting the looks.<br />
<br />
This goes doubly for hiding cloak, helm etc. These are now also per piece instead of per slot and also requires a visit to the transmog vendor. No more disabling through interface options.<br />
<br />
Wish they would just make it a feature you could access from the menu, set up a transmog set and use that for as long as you wanted regardless of replacing items etc.</div></div><hr />

If you enter the portal to the Grizzly hills and then come back through it to the dreamway you fall through the floor and even if you relog you are still constantly falling......this can make you loose your character for good because there is no ticket option to recover lost characters. I watch people run thought and try to come back in ans you can see them half stuck in the ground when they are really falling and being disconnected. I usually tell horde players about it (being horde) but if its alliance i just watch them fall to their doom. I actually tried to warn one guy (a level 110), it looks like he had spent a long time on his/her character. I /point at the portal and turned to him and said /no.....he just looked at me with a confused look and ran through the portal hahahahah, poor guy</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard really needs some better QA on its spelling and grammar. It's getting embarrassing.<br />

It's a crazy thought, but maybe Blizzard could provide a DPS bonus to solo healers?<br />
<br />
Group up with even one other player, and you lose the bonus. But play solo, and you get the DPS boost to make solo questing/leveling less painful.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only way this would work is if this boost also neutered their healing at the same time. <br />
Otherwise, you'd end up with characters who do decent DPS and are also able to heal through basically everything. It would trivialize most PvE content.</div></div><hr />

I've seen that datamine too, but I seriously doubt it. Archmage is already in the game, and the second title that was on that list, Warbringer, is also already ingame and obtainable.. So I think the Ids are just mixing up or something. <br />

But GD these videos are boring. Its nice to know how talents effect your rotation and the different abilities there. But its a VIDEO. If you are simply reading the tooltip and the only thing that is changing is your cursor, tooltip being explained, and the video of yourself in the corner... its hella boring. This would be far more relevant in a blog or a podcast.<br />
<br />
The video should show us something VISUALLY and of the 25 min video less than 5 minutes is actually showing us anything to actually SEE.</div></div><hr />

Otherwise, you'd end up with characters who do decent DPS and are also able to heal through basically everything. It would trivialize most PvE content.<br />
<br />
So you mean they could do like most other mmos and have a dps stance? FFXIV has a cleric stance or buff that nerfs healing but boosts damage on all healers, SWTOR has a similar thing for their healers, never healed in wildstar or got past level 20 so no clue there, in ESO you just put on a dps weapon when you don't wanna heal and have to swap back and forth which limits either role. <br />
<br />
So I'm sure Blizzard is smart enough to you know...figure that out. They just seem to be slow on most things these days seeing as we lack player or guild housing as well, something that has become a staple in mmos. But you know, 433 days between Hellfire and Legion. For a game we play for. We shouldn't really expect much. <br />

*is salty today because of legion launch date*</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly it wasn't bad. The combat. The only thing I didn't like about Vash'jir was the slow travel swimming until you got the sea horse. <br />
<br />
I guess my point is that combat is always been in a 3d space technically. IMHO I think the trouble with the 3d combat is the engine or way that Blizzard makes things path. but eh. I know I know I'm not the majority =)</div></div><hr />

I made this comment earlier in the thread, and yes, it most certainly is.<br />

The slow travel swimming that you had for... What, all of about 6 quests? Those are hard times, daddy-o.<br />
<br />
Vash'jir gave a lot of people headaches. It didn't affect me that way - but I disliked all the crap (seaweed, etc) everywhere. It was annoying.</div></div><hr />

Hmm. Don't remember. on how long till the sea horse. I thought it was halfway through the zone. Maybe not. I did kinda like it though. Guess because it was different and the lore was interesting. Maybe I'm just a weirdo.</div></div><hr />
