You are saying Sinister Strike now only deals 42% damage down from 100%. That corresponds to the link above...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So as an example, Sinister Strike is currently planned to do 42% weapon damage at level 1, with the percentage of weapon damage rising per level up to its maximum potential at 80. &quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
See this blue post: (cant post links)<br />
<br />
We do care about and actively balance at lower levels. Our goal is to make the game as fun and balanced at possible at all levels, however, greater scrutiny from a design standpoint, as well as by the whole community, is placed on the end game. From a perspective of a systems designer, the end game as of patch 4.0.1 is now level 85.<br />
<br />
That said, we will be making several balancing changes in patch 4.0.3a based on what we've been seeing since patch 4.0.1. With regard to lower level players, we plan to adjust damage and healing for all classes from levels 1-79. The base points of almost all spells and abilities are being reduced in order to bring combat times at low levels to a more acceptable length. Some specific spells/abilities are being reduced in damage even more, and in the case of most abilities that deal weapon damage, we're going to make the damage percent scale with level. So as an example, Sinister Strike is currently planned to do 42% weapon damage at level 1, with the percentage of weapon damage rising per level up to its maximum potential at 80.<br />

It's likely that MMO-Champion and others have only been able to datamine the minimum values for these spells as seen when first learned at level 1 or 10 or 20 or whatever. <br />
<br />
Some specific spells/abilities are being reduced in damage even more, and in the case of most abilities that deal weapon damage, we're going to make the damage percent scale with level. So as an example, Sinister Strike is currently planned to do 42% weapon damage at level 1, with the percentage of weapon damage rising per level up to its maximum potential at 80. <br />
<br />
I think these new nummbers are when you first get the skills..not at lvl 85.<br />
<br />
Well i hope so xD</div></div><hr />

So what you will do about AoE fights? Also, the mana cost is a good thing, better then building holy power just for AoE. It was like a rogue need to waste 5 combo points just to use FoK.<br />

Blizzard leaving some already good dps specs as they are, and then nerfing ones that were under preforming. Or them putting in scaling so that at low levels our abilities wouldn't do as much damage and it would reduce the ridiculous amounts of damage we do at low levels and balance them without having any impact on 85.</div></div><hr />

As long as these changes are for 85 balance, cause if any of them went live right now it'd crap all over level 80 balance. that much nerfing to those classes would prett much mean all those nerfed classes would hardly be competetive at all, except maybe the tanks</div></div><hr />

Blue quote said it would effect 1-79, so no. Blizzard found a way to balance low levels without it effecting 80-85. Amazing is it not? Sad part is a lot of these people don't understand that and will soon start screaming that the end of the world is upon us.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Guys, read it. Generally they changed it to spells/skills (especially in melee case) scale with level. So for example Sinister Strike at 1 level may hit for 42% weapon dmg, at lets say 48 will hit for 80% and max weapon dmg (was 150? or sth like that?) at the highest level.</div></div><hr />

Druid tanks survivability was rediculously high. You caould say it was faceroll levels high, so I understand the survivability nerfs. The dmg nerfs is understandable too, since they are ofc gonna buff the threat oif that turns out to be a problem.</div></div><hr />

You are saying Sinister Strike now only deals 42% damage down from 100%. That corresponds to the link above...<br />
<br />
<br />
&quot;So as an example, Sinister Strike is currently planned to do 42% weapon damage at level 1, with the percentage of weapon damage rising per level up to its maximum potential at 80. &quot;<br />
<br />
oh my god please tell me this guy is right, because those ridiculously massive nerfs to rogue abilities is just insane.</div></div><hr />

So to your mentality blizzard removing cloaks rings and trinkets from the game would make the game harder, because it would make characters weaker. This is acceptable to you?</div></div><hr />

Ever think they maybe blizzard didn't want you to aoe for packs of 7-9? And maybe they wanted you to CC and then single target the mobs that didn't get CCed down? If blizzard wants you to aoe, it will be obvious(like a pack of non-elites).</div></div><hr />

I hope this is true. If it does not occur no healer is ever going to die again. As it stands now they ONLY people who can kill healers are those classes considered OP like rogue. It seems moronic that they are nerfing dmg and not nerfing healing at the same time...</div></div><hr />

<br />
See this blue post: (cant post links)<br />
<br />
We do care about and actively balance at lower levels. Our goal is to make the game as fun and balanced at possible at all levels, however, greater scrutiny from a design standpoint, as well as by the whole community, is placed on the end game. From a perspective of a systems designer, the end game as of patch 4.0.1 is now level 85.<br />
<br />
That said, we will be making several balancing changes in patch 4.0.3a based on what we've been seeing since patch 4.0.1. With regard to lower level players, we plan to adjust damage and healing for all classes from levels 1-79. The base points of almost all spells and abilities are being reduced in order to bring combat times at low levels to a more acceptable length. Some specific spells/abilities are being reduced in damage even more, and in the case of most abilities that deal weapon damage, we're going to make the damage percent scale with level. So as an example, Sinister Strike is currently planned to do 42% weapon damage at level 1, with the percentage of weapon damage rising per level up to its maximum potential at 80.<br />
<br />
Finally, next time you post here, could you find a way to be a little more decent? We'd certainly appreciate it. :)<br />

3. who the hell will use arcane shot to dump focus when Cobra shot will deal at least 50% more damage (even more for SV hunters)?<br />

waiting for a Kill Command buff anyway or SV will simply outDPS all other specs facerolling CS/ES<br />

Ambush becomes useful outside of Shadow Dance. Solution, nerf it HARD so now Garrotte is guarenteed to best the best opener at all times again.<br />
<br />
<br />
And I wonder why I'm thinking about not bothering with this game any more.</div></div><hr />

Should fix the low-level zergfest we've been seeing lately -- without changing anything at lvl-80+.<br />
<br />
Thank you, Blizzard!</div></div><hr />

The only thing that makes these nerfs NOT SOUND CRAZY is if they mean that these changed figures are what the abilities will do at level one...and then scale up to what they are now at level 80?</div></div><hr />

<br />
In this patch it will only apply 13% per stack for a maximum of 52%, so now it will simply take them an extra cast to global you. (Old was 23% per hit up to 92%.(glyph provides extra 3%)<br />

I'm calling Blizzard out on knee-jerking on most of the changes here. These aren't thought out or calculated other than on the back of someone's hand, particularly if these are for leveling. <br />
On locks there is no fix to the utter lack of self-healing you get as affliction when you aren't in T10 or cata gear, for kicks I'm gearing a 2nd lock, thing has full blues and heirlooms and honestly even single mob fights take enough health that I have to eat/wait after 2-3 pulls, chain pulling as aff is completely dead.<br />
Hunters are a joke. Aimed shot is supposed to be the &quot;signature&quot; move of marksman, and it isn't ever worth casting.<br />
They're nerfing feral druids, when their damage is already a joke.<br />
They gutted rogues when their dps is already lower than my felguard.</div></div><hr />

Our mastery got buffed while our other abilitys now scale with weapon damage from level 1-79. Care to tell me where you see a nerf?</div></div><hr />

And maybe they wanted you to CC and then single target the mobs that didn't get CCed down? If blizzard wants you to aoe, it will be obvious(like a pack of non-elites).<br />
<br />
I think you understood. Multishot is ONLY effective if it IS a pack of 7-9. And CC? I'm not talking about AoE-ing raids here. The example I used was from ICC, but that's not really your primary AoE concern. Most of the time, you just want to be able to dash through your daily random and AoE your way through all of the trash to get your rewards. Or even just out in the world. Like the Argent daily to kill 15 cultists. It's not a high-end raiding issue. It's a quality of life issue. And yes, this is for level 79 and below, but for a skill that's already so weak, did it really need a nerf?</div></div><hr />

You are by far the best at over exaggerating, however. Bravo!<br />
<br />
Seriously, Blizzard the worst?<br />
<br />
LOL. Mythic would like a word with you.<br />
<br />
It only took them about 2-3 years to address game breaking class imbalances, and still to this day the imbalances that exist are unbelievable. Nothing in WoW, however you may perceive it because you died/lost/under perform/whatever due to poor skill/poor luck/whatever, remotely compares to &quot;poor balancing&quot; that exists in other games. Blizzard are leagues ahead of the competition when it comes to raw data analysis.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You will still use multi-shot if you ever outgear an instance enough to AoE everything down, if things are dying too fast for you to get started on your rotation/prio system obviously it will have an impact on the number of mobs needed for multi-shot to be viable. <br />
<br />
And killing mobs? Really? Ya lets forget about the whole issue of them having a lot of hp and doing some serious damage now, we want our AoE to be balanced as if we could aoe them down!<br />
<br />
AoE wasn't put in the game for grinding mobs for dailies or doing stuff you outgear, so please don't bring those up as reasons for why AoE should be buffed.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bifrost</div><div class="date">2010-11-03, 10:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I get that they're nerfing abilities to keep lower bracket pvp in check, but why would you have weapon attacks that do less than 100% dmg, without any additional effects. I.E Arcane Shot dealing 61% of dmg +flat value. Let's draw a concrete example using my lvl 28 hunter alt: BoA bow deals 52-98dmg, arcane shot deals 100%+31, so a range of 83-129dmg. Post patch it will deal 52-98dmg and arcane shot witll deal 61%+31, so 62-90dmg (values are rounded). Why would autoshot do roughly the same dmg (mean of normal dmg = 75 and mean of arcane shot dmg = 76)as arcane shot, might as well autoshot and play bm while afking from my keyboard. I'm assuming most classes face a situation like this for certains specs, if not all specs in which ability dmg is identical or slightly inferior to regular dmg. Everyone should then just spec for utility skills like survival for explosive shot.<br />
<br />
***The above calculations were done with arcane shot glyphed, so in reality we should subtract 12% of the flat dmg, making the end dmg lower than autoshot dmg.<br />
<br />
The scariest part is that this example uses BoA gear, which implies that the player has already leveled a toon and up to certain is familiar with the game engine....Imagine a new player looking at this and becoming completely confused as to why his abilites don't help him in any way whatsoever.</div></div><hr />

Sadly it looks like Blizzard is just gonna forget every formula they made and just manually fix numbers for each level. <br />
<br />
Game needs to be decently balanced from 1-79. It is not atm and BLizzard has been ingoring it- watching the raw stats lately of raids only. Alot of issues have come up and are continuing show up. For example - now with holy paladins only getting their AOE healing abilites in 80+ the class is very serioulsy gimped in 5 man runs for early content. Neither is there a serious buildup of healing spells from 1-79. Other healers have pretty much balanced spells all throughout the leveling progress - if they prefer to use their healing spec in few 5 mans.<br />
<br />
Lets not forget that this game is not just about end levels.</div></div><hr />

But at least it makes the 31 point talent worth picking up now... And you got a choise on how to heal with your Holy powers. It gives me a hope that BLizzard is actually working on the issues.</div></div><hr />

2% down from 3% - good<br />

12 second CD up from 6 second CD - uber bad...<br />
<br />
doubling the CD timer for it is a bit much... i can see beteween 7-9 seconds up from 6... but not 12. Blizz needs to learn that a nerf bat is a nerf bat... NOT a nerf SLEDGE hammer... you're so up tight about scaling things right but never really look at how hard you're trying to scale things up or down... it almost seems as if you just throw some numbers out there and see if it works. why not try actually calculating the numbers out... i did and thats beyond nerfing...<br />
<br />
you've already ruined innervate even more than it already was. you've already ruined resto druid's spirit by completely removing tranquil spirit which inscreased our spirit gain by 15%... Druids have always been a spirit based class *regardless of how many others stacked pure SP*. the least you could do is put the mana cost reduction talents BACK in the resto tree where they belong if you're going to yet again butcher the last mana regeneration source we have... not in the balance tree... if other classes are complaining about mana regen, increase theirs, don't just butcher 1 class... all that's gonna do is make ALL of them complain and you'll NEVER hear the end of it...</div></div><hr />

Base damage =/= abilities total damage. Stop skewing changes to make your QQ sound warranted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I swear blizzard have no idea how to make warriors work, I feel like a brick with a weapon im so slow and clunky compared to everyone else but apparently warriors are the most mobile.......</div></div><hr />

<br />
---<br />
Holy Shield now increases the amount your shield blocks by an additional 10% for 20 sec instead of increasing your block chance by 15%.<br />
---<br />
<br />
Block chance &gt; block value increase of abysmal 10%. <br />
<br />
QQ.</div></div><hr />

Base damage - 12%, no additional change still = a small nerf.<br />
<br />
Stop reading only half the message to make your own rebuttal sound warranted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Lol read well mage arcane was just a dmg trade between Arcane blast and other spells<br />
<br />
Frost got nerfed across the board, QQ more<br />
<br />
Oh and stop complaining those are for 85 not 80 atm<br />
<br />
But i belive they should have reduced finger of frost proc to 25% 20% seems lil too much. 15% wsnt enough 30% OP, 20 invvolve way too hard RNG (1 out of 5 instead of 1 out of 3 its a 30%-40% reduction to a core talent)</div></div><hr />

I wasn't saying that they weren't nerfed. It's just incorrect to say &quot;Warlocks got nerfed by 12%&quot; But yeah let's spread misleading statements in this thick slurry of tears on this thread.</div></div><hr />
