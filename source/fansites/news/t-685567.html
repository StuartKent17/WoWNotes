Back in may I saw http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17367601961 (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17367601961) and http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17779679689 (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17779679689) and thought it would be fun to combine them.<br />
<br />
First try I died to being over confident, second try I died to 3 casters respawns on top of me while in higher levels, last try was death due to server lag.<br />
<br />
At first I was only going to do no deaths and no achievements but as I was grinding I thought I could do this without quests. On the second try I thought I could avoid flight paths all together. Then on the third try I had made a list of all the restrictions I thought I could go through.<br />
<br />
They had to be:<br />
<br />
No death<br />
No questing<br />
No instances, BGs or Arenas<br />
No mounts or flight paths<br />
No professions<br />
No loot<br />
Just grinding.<br />
<br />
Contrary to what people think this took a lot of practice and planning. I had to be careful what parts of maps to discover, what mobs to grind and be aware of places I could fall from. Cautious the warrior died from falling so a mage would help. Also I needed to travel a lot so portals would help a ton moving around. Actually the ports where the main reason I picked a mage and also for invisibility at higher levels which saved my arse many times.<br />
<br />
Finally since this was a pve server I didn t need more escape mechanism than what mages had. Played was about 10 days and 12 hours but that also involves many hours on the AH scanning and looking for gear so it is not that accurate. I did use RAF on the first try but it wasn t efficient to dual box and I abandoned the idea on the second try because it would have been not worthy.<br />
<br />
It was full solo 31900 mobs grinded in about 4 months. Some 6 hours sessions, some only rested XP. Basically a little everyday. Next is finishing the same thing on a pvp server...but on a different name and a different class and no you can not know what server :)<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;<br />
<br />
Congratulations to him for such an impressive achievement, that's definitely a lot of time and dedication! <br />

Winter's Veil Achievement and Quest Concerns<br />
Posted by Syndri on the Customer Service forum: http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=22048397469&amp;sid=1<br />
<br />
-- <br />
<br />
We’re aware that many players have experienced difficulty completing the achievement “’Tis the Season” and the quest “Metzen the Reindeer.” While the Game Master department will not be in a position to grant credit for this achievement or quest, here are a few tips to help you complete them on your own.<br />
<br />
‘Tis The Season<br />
<br />
We’ve received many reports of players not receiving the “Tis’ the Season” achievement despite meeting the listed requirements (eating Graccu’s Mince Meat Fruitcake with 3 pieces of Winter Clothing equipped), and this is most often related to “broken” Winter Clothing.<br />
<br />
To ensure that you are able to receive this achievement, please check the durability of your Winter Clothing and repair any broken pieces prior to eating Graccu’s Mince Meat Fruitcake. If any pieces of equipped Winter Clothing are broken at the time that Graccu’s Mince Meat Fruitcake is eaten, you will not be eligible for the “’Tis the Season” achievement.<br />
<br />
Metzen the Reindeer<br />
<br />
We’ve also received a number of reports that Smokywood Satchels do not always include a Pouch of Reindeer Dust if received while in a raid group. Unfortunately, without the Pouch of Reindeer Dust, the quest “Metzen the Reindeer” cannot be completed.<br />
<br />
To guarantee that your Smokywood Satchel contains both Metzen’s Letters and Notes and the Pouch of Reindeer dust, please make sure that you are not in a raid group when you accept this quest. If you have this quest in your log currently but are unable to complete it due to the missing quest item, please abandon the quest and accept it again while not in a raid group. <br />
<br />
<br />
World of Warcraft Movie Contest<br />
We're pleased to announce the Alienware-sponsored World of Warcraft Rise to Power Movie Contest. Players are once again being called on to create movies set in Azeroth. This is a great way for up-and-coming directors to display their moviemaking skills. The four winning entrees will receive $2,400 credit towards an All Powerful Alienware desktop or laptop.

4 levels grinded in valgarde valgarde alone with the NPCs finishing the kills so that would probably account for some there. For the rest I would say pet and dots maybe...i don t know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it's a game and people can play it the way they like. They shouldn't all be drooling over gearscore and farming epics from the breaking dawn till twilight(see what I did there?).<br />
<br />
<br />
Also at all you people obsessed with proving that this is fake; what the hell does it matter to you? Are you just so insecure that you have to go and examine every little detail about every new's post, instead of congratulating the player on his/her achievement?<br />

<br />
Check his &quot;Got my mind on my money&quot; achievement. He looted 79s 40c. Not that much of a lie it seems.<br />
Still i don't see the point in not looting if you are sending money over from another char anyway.</div></div><hr />

All the beats I would kill I would open the loot window for skinners to grab the skins. I had a guy follow me for 2 hours in Zul and Howling fjord skinning beasts. He must have made a fortune.<br />
<br />
And the 79 silver came from an item I sold to a merchant by mistake instead of trashing the old gear.<br />
<br />
Conspiracy much?<br />
<br />
Anyway not looting is really nothing its the not dying part and the absolute minimal achievements that were hard.</div></div><hr />

Beasts...I opened the trade window so that skinners would be able to skin those beasts. I only have about 79s in looted silver and that I believe was me being stupid and vendoring an item. I may have shift clicked by mistake because I was tired once or twice but please enough with the conspiracies seriously.<br />
<br />
I ll be sure to start over because I may have looted once or twice in 32000 mobs lolz<br />
<br />
The loot part is about not getting money from kills really or not getting items. How much money you can make vendoring meat or stuff beasts drop is probably trivial compared to getting 500G by mail from your main.</div></div><hr />

Ever occurred to you that MMO is being run by members of the rather imperfect human race, and can occasionally make mistakes?<br />
<br />
<br />
He played 10 days 12 hours over 4 months.That is an average of 2,1 hours a day<br />
He leveled a mage on a pve server without dying.<br />
He said no loot, but he was scanning AH for gear ( I guess gold fell and hit him on the head )<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, but this is not impressive at all. <br />
<br />
All it takes is some planning ahead to minimize travel time, knowledge of an area and its mobs and a bit of focused play. It just takes some dedication which most of players cba to put into the game, as the reward for the time investment is zilch , apart from the personal satisfaction you receive.</div></div><hr />

He also said that he got around 500 g from his main. This was probably used to buy gear and repair bills. He had at least 2 BoA items, the staff and shoulders, but still this is impressive to me.<br />

i think he broke 2 of his owns rules many times and so my conclusion is: he failed on his mission the moment he bought stuff at the ah from gold of another char.</div></div><hr />

It's the mage's fault for conveniently omitting it out of the information provided with his &quot;deed&quot;l. People with brains will immediately make the connection that: no loot or quests = no purchases off the AH . <br />

There have been characters that did no other achievements (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=17779679689&amp;sid=1&amp;pageNo=1), and there have been people who have done no deaths (http://www.wow.com/2009/06/04/achieved-level-1-to-80-with-no-deaths/).

Loosely taken yes, you could even say that the only thing you ever get out of doing anything is some personal satisfaction (besides, all we humans do is satisfy needs).

I agree that it would have been more impressive on a melee, but he also used heirloom gear which makes up a great deal of the gear discrepancy.

<br />
Not dying in wow is pretty easy.. it just takes a lot of caution and concentration, being aware of what is around you and not getting yourself into situations you can't escape out of. With most alts now I don't die until the high teens and thats usually because of a stupid error like jumping off a hill or doing a leeroy and pulling too many mobs at once by being too cocky and taking on mobs that are too high.<br />
<br />
Granted it does a lot of focus and planning your pulls but it's not exactly amazing. Plus he played frost mage, possibly one of the easiest classes to survive solo grinding with. I've lost count of how many times ice nova &amp; ice barrier saved my life in wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
To do this you need to be completely anti-social and waste 4 months of your life not actually being productive.<br />
<br />
On one hand i respect him because he set himself an extremely challenging goal which he focused and accomplished, on the other hand it's completely pointless and doesn't contribute anything to anyone.<br />
<br />
I sit on the fence on this one, it isn't a healthy thing to achieve, but well, at least his goals were met.<br />
<br />
Maybe it's just a sign that the recession in this World will drive people to doing anything to stop themselves going insane, i have no clue :-\<br />

read the thread. is was proven that it was actually done before. the &quot;rules&quot; he made like no looting are the only things, that others might not have been done during leveling without death.<br />

I have had World kills in Sunwell, Ulduar, Argent Colesium with 3 different guilds.<br />
<br />
I have also played in World rank 400 guilds and i am currently playing my alt (which i am making my main, i dropped my main char for the time being that has over 9000 achieve points) in a levelling guild. I am level 72 and new people come and go in this guild as they move on etc.<br />
<br />
Do you know what playing in a World top 20 ranked guild and playing an a rankless levelling guild all have in common for me.<br />
<br />
Everybody played together to have fun and encourage each other.<br />
<br />
This guy does the complete opposite. He has set his own goals and played the game his way. Now i don#t condone him for this, i acutally respect him for achieving his own difficult goals.<br />
<br />
But it is the nature of the accomplishment i find disturbing. Complete anti social, unhealthy behaviour that benefits neither him nor anybody else to gain something that is ultimately pointless in the game for no reason whatsoever than just to say &quot;I did this&quot;.<br />
<br />
I'm all for self sacrifice for the good of your guild, but self sacrifice for something that is anti social and unhealthy, with no benefots to anyone.<br />
<br />
Nah, i'm not really into that.<br />
<br />
Don't we all have those kind of alts? The kind of alt we just use to get away from everyone? Just to settle back and relax for a bit?<br />
<br />
You're talking like he decided 6 months ago that he won't talk to anyone ever again until he completed the leveling. It's obvious that he was in a guild and probably partook in conversations. And he said himself that he either had 6 hour sessions or just rested experience. Just a little every day. It's not like he was working on this 24-7 since then. [if he was, he'd probably have been done by now, to be honest] It's also obvious that he has an 80 already and he might be raiding the same area as you. He just decided to make an alt with a specific goal in mind.<br />
<br />
This may come as a complete shock to you, but a guy can have an alt dedicated to just leveling by grinding and he could actually be both in a guild with a lot of good people AND healthy. Your speech about being anti-social and unhealthy could very well be falling on the ears OF the social and healthy. You're assuming, and that's not good.</div></div><hr />

But, can someone define to me the &quot;no loot&quot; rule? Obviously this guy had to have looted something. Where would he get the gold to buy stuff? He had to &quot;loot&quot; something to get money, unless he bought gold through a chinese farmer. Did someone just dump gold in his lap and he went on grinding? Something here doesn't make sense. <br />
<br />
By definition, when you loot something, you open up the corpse of a dead mob. There are items and money on the corpse. So, wouldn't the act of opening up the corpse to get the items and money consititute &quot;looting&quot;? Now, I can understand they guy selling everything and not keeping anything, which is difficult when something epic drops, but makes sense. <br />
<br />
And as Arkthugal points out, he had to &quot;loot&quot; as for other players to skin the dead animals. Is there some clear definition of &quot;looting&quot; somewhere on a WoW website or in the game guidelines?</div></div><hr />

I don't think that this was a waste of time. After all, the mage is now 80, so with a little help from the main she'll be viable for heroics etc. 80 is 80, after all. Sure, it may not be efficient, but it never hurts to stop and smell the roses. Some of my favorite moments of this game come from screwing around (the Sen'jin witch doctor FTW). It may not be everyone's idea of fun, but if a guy can enjoy it, why be critical?<br />
<br />
Shelf the character for about 6 months and continue to the grind to 85 in Cataclysm. Better yet, role a new Neverdied for Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

There are alot of these rare &quot;Undying&quot; players out there. I agree with the whole special title just for that accomplishment.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">adikos</div><div class="date">2009-12-24, 03:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">It is but at the same time it isn't. If he would of played a melee based class it would of been impressive. Mages are typically pretty easy even without gear. It used to be gear didnt have any damage increasing effects until you got raid gear...it wasnt until patch 2.xsomethingsomethingdarkside that they changed lower level gear to have SP. So he basically leveled like mages used to...save for a few stat increases. <br />
<br />
And obviously if he didn't die, he didnt farm Defias Pillagers. <br />
<br />
<br />
this sums up exactly how i took this feat. its impressive when you hear it but less so once you consider some aspects. clearly leveling a mage now would be cake and having leveled a ton of toons already i'd know the places to go and the places to avoid (defias pillages is on that list). he's being spoon fed gear/weapons (if not the hierloom items). not looting or questing means he could literally hand pick the easiest mobs in a given zone and be particular about pathing to those mobs. not using a mount is because it wasnt really necessary, if you arent going back to town ever 30 minutes to turn in quests/sell items then you arent really going to need a mount. really these restrictions made it easier i'd think.<br />
<br />
in a nutshell and imho this feat would have been amazing pre-BC but now its only so-so. i wont deny its cool someone went through and did it, but it's lost shock value with the way things have changed. its like going from darnassas to iron forge day one of servers at lvl 1. it might have seemed hard then but now its hardly an issue.<br />

I looked back at all the captures I did and I DO indeed loot the shoveltusk in Howling Fjord. I guess this was a shift click mistake because I had Dinged 70 on that mount 2 sec ago and misclicked but hey that means I looted all mobs. Consider the no loot = no gold looted then, does that work better since I only have 79s from an item sold at a vendor? and technically no loot =/= no looting so semantics but hey since people are nerdraging on this...</div></div><hr />

<br />
but if wow were divided into difficulty's you just did it on easy.<br />
<br />
its not gonna happen on a pvp server.<br />
<br />
its not that big of a feat, the only reason i say this is because you are on a pve server. You've taken out 85% of the things that will kill you by doing it on a pve server.<br />
<br />
wait... i leveled 1-80 in 5 minutes without a death. It was on a private server... wheres my front page with no loot, no kills, no anything. isnt that just as impressive?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monsoon</div><div class="date">2009-12-24, 04:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Actually I should remove the no loot and replace it with no gold looted as that would be more appropriate. Good thing I didn t write 'no looting'.<br />
<br />
I looked at many of the captures I did on that mage and I looted many more times but never any gold so I guess you can say the loot part is not correct but hey that wasn t malicious or intentional. Here is another video I made during the grind where I was screwing up with a bot for about 4 hours and it appears that I was looting white items in it. So spank me silly I should have said no gold looted :)<br />
<br />

<br />
Also since I was screwing with at least 2 bots during leveling so that can probably account for more killing blows for them.<br />
<br />
I hope that shows that I am honest and recognize mistakes. I run 5 accounts maxed out and many neverdieds as backups so you will forgive me for it hopefully.</div></div><hr />

I explained at least 5 times that I would open the loot window on beasts so that skinners could skin beasts. I guess I looted some of them as I explained a post above yours. To be fair I didn t write no looting I wrote no loot when I posted about it. No loot meant no gold looted as you can see on the achievement part as I only have 79 silver on it so technically I never looted gold but looted white items from beasts so that skinners could use the skins.<br />
<br />
I guess that totally nullifies the whole grind.</div></div><hr />

No. You know that you don't have the patience and determination to even attempt such a thing and therefore you are trying to make his accomplishment less significant by pointing out how boring, unhealthy and antisocial it is to make yourself feel better.</div></div><hr />

My sentiments are the same as Arg's above me. I'd also like to point out that he was in a guild, as you can see from the guild chat, and that he was 'congratulations'd' upon hitting 80 and accomplishing his feat. I'd find it hard to believe he didn't chat with them while questing or even joked around in vent with friends.<br />
<br />
Regardless, an accomplishment is an accomplishment. I hadn't seen this done before, and therefore his completion of it is commendable. He saw a path no one had walked. Set a goal, walked it and completed it. You don't need to be surrounded by friends and loved ones and other people in order to validate an accomplishment.</div></div><hr />

Anyone could go through without looting, only getting the 80 achievement points, and I will grant you on a pve server its much easier not to die.<br />

You're an idiot, try getting to 50 without any deaths, avoiding all achievements, doing no quests. Even with heirloom gear and boe epics and whatever. Then try getting to 80. You'll be surprised.<br />

I leveled 7 characters to Level 80. My mage is 77 and my priest is 65, so 2 more will hit 80 soon. I know how hard it is to not die even once. On every character I died a couple of times, mostly because I play on a PvP Realm and do a lot of quests and dungeons... do a dungeon and you'll die eventually. Go into contested territory, and you'll run into a Level 80 char who will one-hit you. Do some orange quests or try to solo an elite monster... yes sooner or later you will die... BUT he avoided all of that. The only thing he did was grind low level mobs to make sure he wouldn't die. I'm not jealous or anything but there is absolutely no challenge in doing that. As far as I see it, he even plays on a PvE realm. I'll still say grats, because I think it was a nice idea. ;)</div></div><hr />

Easy, just to grind low level mobs, nothing says how hard the mobs he encountered were. He might have as well have grinded DM. When I leveled my frost mage, I died about 5 times trough 1-80, and I was not even trying to be careful. And it's PvE server.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not, however, in the slightest 'impressive' and is far from an achievement. I'm sure that some thought and planning went into this but this is little more than an endurance stunt, there's no value to it and it required far more luck than skill. All it proves is that someone had more time on their hands than they knew what to do with and chose something as inane as this as a means to squander that excess time.<br />
<br />
Several of the no's in your list actually diminish this and play a central role in this not being worthy of note. Chief amongst these is no questing and no dungeons. Most of the situations in which a player is likely to die occur during quests or instances so avoiding those essentially voided no deaths as anything impressive. Other no's simply feel tacked on like no loot and no professions, neither of which are in any way required to successfully get a character from 1 to 80.<br />
<br />
Basically you chose to avoid the situations in which you were most likely to die (questing and instances), walked everywhere (except for the fact that you used mage ports and probably used other non-FP in game transport like boats), chose not to do certain optional things that do not impact leveling (looting and professions), and you just killed mobs for 250+ hours and we're supposed to be impressed? Just because something can be accomplished with enough time spent doing it does not make the act of accomplishing it an achievement worth of note or praise.<br />
<br />
Ultimately if this made you happy and you enjoyed it then more power to you and best of luck with future time sinks you may discover. I will be waiting here as the first person to praise you when you accomplish something real like grinding a toon all the way to 80 doing only instances using the random the dungeon tool. That would be a true feat of skill and worthy of praise.</div></div><hr />

You basically focused on the elements of the game that (for me) are very annoying -- grinding NPCs, running around with no mount -- and willingly tortured yourself for hours on end. Congrats on finishing your goal but I'm not sure why you would want to do this. It's only impressive to me in the sense that I can't believe you chose to do it... kinda like it'd be impressive for a guy to randomly break his own finger out of boredom?</div></div><hr />

It doesn't matter if he/she did this by accident. It happened. If he/died by accident it would count so why didn't the accidental loot doesn't?

<br />
And he didnt say anything about no looting in the end. Those were just starting restrictions so he could achieve &quot;no achievements&quot; achievement :)<br />

The point of not looting was not to make it harder, it was to make sure to not get achievements for looting too much gold. He got to 80 with the bare minimum achievements possible, looting 100g would have resulted in the first &quot;Got My Mind on My Money&quot; and 10 achievement points. If he took things other than gold, if he took 99 gold, it doesn't matter, he set the rule and followed it as much as he needed to just to avoid an achievement. <br />

The idea that the only way to have fun playing a game is following what the majority of people does is WRONG.<br />
Wow is extremely vast and complex and has been around for YEARS. Trying something different is inevitable!<br />
<br />
For example: before WOTLK came out, I levelled all classes to 70, equipped all of them with epic or blue gear, capped fishing, cooking and 2 professions each with every char, gave all of them an epic flyer (2 of them where engineer chopters).. then stopped. That was exactly my goal.<br />
This is the only way you can beat a game that has no end: you chose a goal and you make it.<br />
So, please, don't bash someone because has done something (amazing) that you consider just a waste of time.<br />
This applies to anything in life: everyone knows what flies his boat.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, whatever floats your boat. It's certainly impressive but not terribly interesting to me.<br />
<br />
I'm much more interested in the people who level without kills, who level naked (no gear at all, unequip the gear they start with) or the 10 man SM raids at level 20.<br />
<br />
A few thoughts I've had in this vein:<br />
<br />
Level 70 without going to Outland. Level 80 without going to Northrend OR Outland (tricky but remotely possible, easier if you count the CoT instances). Level 70 without leaving the Death Knight tutorial. Paladin to 80 without using any holy spells or abilities. Hunter without a pet. Warrior without stances. (It is theoretically possible to get a warrior into a stanceless state.) Level entirely through PvP. Level entirely through the dungeon system. Run through every dungeon as a warrior who does nothing but heal using special equipment, trinkets, bandages and racials, bonus if you manage to be the main healer and everyone else in the party is level appropriate. Get defense capped as a priest through gems, enchants and weapons and start tanking level appropriate instances. (I think this is at least doable at 70 using WotLK gems/enchants.)<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think there's a lot of crazy stuff you could do now with level 70 PvE twinks using experience capping and WotLK gems/enchants along with weapons, necks, rings and trinkets meant for other classes.<br />
<br />
Anybody want to try a ranged warrior? As-in, no melee attacks from 1-80? It would take persistence. A ton of haste to be viable. Maybe some consumables like Magic Dust for CC.</div></div><hr />

Then put your money where your mouth is. I'm not even going to challenge you to do the same thing he did. Just get from 1-80 without dying. That's it. If you can do that, feel free to trash on this guy all you want.<br />
<br />
But guess what? You can't. Don't tell me you don't have the time. If you're trolling this forum then you've played WoW for a hell of a lot more than 240 hours. And guess what? For all the time you've put into the game, you don't have a post about you on MMO-Champion and a topic with 200 posts debating your achievements. Nope, of course you don't. In fact, no one gives a shit about you. But he's the loser, right? ::)<br />
<br />
No, doing something like that isn't for me. I'm still amazed by &quot;The Insane&quot; achievement. But I give major props to someone that would challenge themselves like that. I know it's just a game, but knowing that you've done something no one has done before, no matter how mundane, is something to be proud of. Have you guys ever seen the movie &quot;The King of Kong&quot;? I couldn't believe anyone still played that game, and yet even I was proud of the guy who broke the world record.

What exactly makes you think that this is hard? Just do what the mage did: avoid everything dangerous... don't do quests, don't do achievements, don't do dungeons and go on a PvE realm. Just grind!

No one has done this before. Very few have probably even thought of attempting this. I'm just truly impressed of the dedication of not doing any quests. This is almost like playing Aion after level 25 with the amount of grinding you need to do.

In a game like WoW this is phenomenally easy, especially for old-school gamers who played the likes of Angband and it's variants:<br />
<br />
http://angband.oook.cz/<br />
http://rephial.org/<br />
<br />
In WoW you might get stunned or counterspelled every 5000 mobs or so. <br />
<br />
In Angband you will get blinded (really see nothing, not just stagger about a bit), drugged, poisoned with proper deadly poison, fall down traps, come across out of depth monsters (try fighting Ragnaros at level 10), have your possessions burned/melted by acid/shattered by frost/stolen, your food eaten by invisible ghosts until you starve to death from hunger (after drinking that unidentified potion which turned out to be salt water that made you vomit). <br />
<br />
Your stats and experience will get reduced, reducing your level (imagine the whining you would get from WoW players if this happened), with the only way to restore yourself is to buy a restoration potion from town that you get back to with a word of recall scroll, yes the word of recall scroll that was just burned by that bastard red dragon... <br />
<br />
Of course that's all if you manage to get past that floating eye which was standing right next to the down staircase from town on level 1, the eye that paralyzes you every turn so you can never ever fight back and you simply die from hunger after 10000 turns of being unable to take a single action.<br />
<br />
And many many more ways to die. Oh and of course once you die the game does not let you continue, you have to start again by rolling a totally new character.<br />
<br />
To put it into context, I started playing Moria (Angband's predecessor) when I was 12 or 13 years old. I finally beat the game earlier this year, shortly after my 33rd birthday. At times playing fairly regularly, sometimes not playing for years.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying this to say WoW players suck, or don't know how easy you have it, but a lot of you seem to be crying out for something difficult and challenging. Well, give this game a try and I look forward to seeing your winning posts on the angband.oook.cz forums ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Exactly. It's basically what the gold farming/power level sites do. They sit there and grind nonstop against mobs that don't prove a challenge to people that have nearly NO idea how to play the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
My personal favorite is that everyone is defending him looting a mob. The player already broke their own rules. And that's from what we DID see. Who knows, maybe they looted every mob - not like you'd know. All I know is they said NO LOOTING, and they did just that.<br />
<br />
Also, what's the difficulty in not looting mobs if you have another character funding your project? His gear changed, which shouldn't have if he stuck to his rules(admittedly, didn't say he couldn't farm on other toons despite it defeating the purpose of the challenge). He's also using boa shoulders in the clip, so we also know he had 10% exp bonus the entire time.<br />
<br />
Overall, it's not a challenge. It's time consuming, so hats off for wasting that much time... But LOL if we should be impressed by the fact that you spent time on it AND BROKE YOUR OWN RULES.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Monsoon</div><div class="date">2009-12-25, 09:09 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I didn t break my own rule I CLEARLY said 'no loot' and not 'no looting'. No loot means no gold looted as this is in par with the minimal achievements. Looting happens. No loot means no items from mobs/bosses/quest rewards.<br />
<br />
But hey you want to poke holes at it...go ahead I don't give a fark lolz. All the Nerdrage I got from this really made my Christmas 100% better.<br />
<br />
So I opened some loot windows sometimes and even sometimes grabbed white items on them to trash them later...big effing deal so call the police and stop the presses zomg he lied !!!11!! I must post my nerdrage about this and vent my frustration &lt;insert murloc noise&gt;.<br />
<br />
You guys being upset at this is what made this all thing oh sooooo worthwhile. I can not wait to post that I leveled the same way to 80 on a pvp server with the new addition I thought about. Gosh you guys are going to blow your head off 'Scanners' type with that one lolz.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is not, however, in the slightest 'impressive' and is far from an achievement. I'm sure that some thought and planning went into this but this is little more than an endurance stunt, there's no value to it and it required far more luck than skill. All it proves is that someone had more time on their hands than they knew what to do with and chose something as inane as this as a means to squander that excess time.<br />
<br />
Several of the no's in your list actually diminish this and play a central role in this not being worthy of note. Chief amongst these is no questing and no dungeons. Most of the situations in which a player is likely to die occur during quests or instances so avoiding those essentially voided no deaths as anything impressive. Other no's simply feel tacked on like no loot and no professions, neither of which are in any way required to successfully get a character from 1 to 80.<br />
<br />
Basically you chose to avoid the situations in which you were most likely to die (questing and instances), walked everywhere (except for the fact that you used mage ports and probably used other non-FP in game transport like boats), chose not to do certain optional things that do not impact leveling (looting and professions), and you just killed mobs for 250+ hours and we're supposed to be impressed? Just because something can be accomplished with enough time spent doing it does not make the act of accomplishing it an achievement worth of note or praise.<br />
<br />
Ultimately if this made you happy and you enjoyed it then more power to you and best of luck with future time sinks you may discover. I will be waiting here as the first person to praise you when you accomplish something real like grinding a toon all the way to 80 doing only instances using the random the dungeon tool. That would be a true feat of skill and worthy of praise. This post is more newsworthy and truthful then anything he's 'accomplished'.</div></div><hr />

Lolz...do you guys even read the pages on which you post comments?<br />
<br />
It says NO LOOT not NO LOOTING</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Either way you looted AND as a consequence of that action received the loot. <br />
It doesn't matter if your rule was &quot;No loot&quot; or &quot;No looting&quot;, because you broke both rules: you looted something and received the loot.<br />
And it's also not true that loot = gold. Everything that you can loot is loot. If it's gold, gear or some stinking fur.<br />
Now don't get me wrong, I don't care if you looted or not, because this was all about hitting 80 without dying and without achievements. <br />
Like I said, it was a nice idea, but I still don't see what's the big deal about grinding all the way to 80. There is no real danger of dying when you avoid PvP, dungeons and quests. Grinding is the most easy and boring way to play this game. But that's just my opinion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actualy I just looked at my statistics and it also shows this but still that would be instances/raids and whatnot, but if 1 person is alone killing mobs surely if he killed say 600 mobs he would get the killing blow on 600?</div></div><hr />

I never called anybody a noob...I usually don t taunt people unless they really deserve it which in this thread is actually quite a large number of people who:<br />
<br />
- can t read<br />
- come to their own conclusions<br />
- can't read<br />
- should look at themselves (ie the 10k achievements peeps) before calling other mad and obsessed<br />
<br />
If you had read the thread you would have found out that first, mages have pets so that takes away some of the killing blows. Second I explained that I grinded several levels and that is about 8000 to 9000 mobs in valgarde where the NPCs help you kill stuff. Those two alone are enough to get to the difference. But hey keep trying to poke holes, its entertaining as I already mentioned. the Valgarde grind does not make things faster or easier. You still have to tag the mobs and ovoid them and it takes the same amount of time to kill them.<br />
<br />
Summons? ZOMG I took summons WTFBBQ111!!1! I lied as I clearly said too that I would not take any summons. Holy cow 18 summons in 80 levels!!! that is clearly an unfair advantage. Have you ever considered that I may have taken summons to groups or friends or guildies that needed water, int or ports as they too were leveling.<br />
/sigh<br />
<br />
I didn t boast about anything whatsoever so please enough with the ad hominems seriously.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it does matter. My grind, my rules. I said no loot not no looting. I know it must hurt down there but the no loot was for a good reason: to not get the 100g achievement. If people are too thick to realize that then there is really nothing I can do to help.<br />
<br />
That is why it is important to have reading skills that enable you to properly understand and recognize words. A word like 'looting' meaning an action/verb when the word 'loot' in itself is a description of merely content. You can receive loot without looting. You can be looting without receiving loot.<br />
<br />
but hey its semantics right. It doesn t matter what my goals or objectives were or how I wanted to do this right? What matters is trying to poke hole and attack the player right?<br />
<br />
