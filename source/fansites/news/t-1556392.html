Warlords of Draenor Beta - Addons Enabled<br />
Addons are enabled in the current build, though many will need to be updated for 6.0 before they will function properly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Beta - July 21 Raid Testing Schedule<br />
Warlords of Draenor raid testing will begin this week!<br />
On Monday, July 21, we will begin our Warlords raid testing with one Heroic encounter from Highmaul, and one from Blackrock Foundry. As this is the very first raid test of the beta, it is quite possible that there will be technical or gameplay issues that disrupt the testing. Thank you in advance for your patience and understanding.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Our general plan is to test every encounter on Heroic difficulty first, and then test sections of the raid on Normal and Raid Finder, alongside targeted Mythic tests.<br />
<br />
Each encounter should be available at approximately the listed times below on all Beta servers.<br />
<br />
Monday, July 21<br />
The Butcher - Heroic Highmaul<br />
13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
Gruul - Heroic Blackrock Foundry<br />
16:00 PDT (19:00 EDT, 01:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of a beta environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />
<br />
Important Testing Notes<br />
<br />
Q: How do I get into the raid zone?<br />
A: In Stormwind, Orgrimmar, and your garrison, you may speak to Nexus-Lord Donjon Rade in order to teleport into the raid zone while it is open for testing. (The option to teleport into a zone will not be available when the zone is not open for testing.)<br />
<br />
Q: What character should I use to test the raid?<br />
A: Whichever you prefer. We will be scaling players' effective level to 100 for raid testing, and their item level to an appropriate threshold for the encounter(s) being tested.<br />
<br />
Q: How long does testing last?<br />
A: The primary purpose of testing is to give us the information we need to balance the encounters, evaluate how mechanics are playing out in practice, and identify bugs. Once we're satisfied that we've received that information for a given boss, we'll be shutting down testing. Usually this takes anywhere from 45 minutes to 2 hours, but there are no guarantees.<br />
<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Problem is, you will want to fill in as many gcds as possible. Playing the #waiting game for resources is bad design.<br />
Your first statement is mostly true, assuming that's optimal DPS. Second is only sometimes true; see Rogues/Ferals. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/488476584093831168))<br />
Watched energy while waiting, and inevitably was around 40-45 energy when I needed it (sometimes as low as 30-35).<br />
Sounds great. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/488532642090872833))<br />

with removal of HS/BS, what are blood DKs spending their blood/death runes on?<br />
Pestilence (which is actually a merger of Pestilence and Blood Boil). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/488977334179860481))<br />

what's supposed to give mana back as boomkin, was doing signle target and went oom? What did I do wrong?<br />
They should never run OOM doing just DPS. Mana regen for them is all passive now. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/489149663191121920))<br />

Don't normally like posting these but http://t.co/TLmiyDCqoa any thoughts on that suggestion?<br />
We're raising Lock and Load's duration to 30sec, and giving Survival an additional 10% baseline multistrike chance to help. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/488476995211116546))<br />
More charges and a longer duration will be great though. Concern is just that you almost cant hold them without dropping DPS 2/2<br />
It will be a slight *sustained* DPS loss to pool them, in exchange for a significant *burst* DPS gain. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/488483708752498688))<br />

Ascention and haste are far from solving it. we had the same problem in first tier of MoP with 40 energy jabs<br />
Not being GCD capped is not a problem for an energy class. Energy classes should generally be Energy-capped, not GCD-cap. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/488536829449097217))<br />

Can we expect any changes to Seraphim soon? Currently it is by far the weakest level 100 talent choice for Ret.<br />
We'll get to it in tuning. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/488785567144869888))<br />

With you having to cut down a warrior ability for rage dump why was HS dropped and not WS.<br />
Because cutting WS and not HS results in a ton of deadtime in your rotation; feels extremely slow. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/488869026198601728))<br />
<br />
Challenge Modes<br />
How about disabling sockets or at least make gems scale as well ? Raid gear was overpowered for CM b/ce of sockets, vs 463<br />
Yep. The way sockets work in 6.0 (optional bonus property) means that we can solve CM power creep from gems. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/488722438503419904))<br />
Is this implying &quot;bonus&quot; sockets will be disabled in CM's? What about other bonuses?<br />
Right, gems won't count towards CM stats (like how the Sha-touched gem didn't in 5.x). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/488740757826580480))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Is the buff for soloing old raids coming in the Pre-Patch 6.0? #Warlords<br />
Yeah, it's not a &quot;buff&quot; so much as a core change to the combat ruleset for fighting lower-level creatures. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/488803112585420800))<br />
Will Mists lvl 93 bosses be effected by this when we are lvl 100? So we can solo Mists raids?<br />
No, Mists endgame wasn't squished. Some will likely be able to solo Mists raids at 100, the way some can solo Cata raids now. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/488805105517350912))<br />
I expect the solo ability to remain consistent: harder the closer you are to current cap, easier the older it is<br />
Yes, goal is for everything to feel exactly as if no squish ever happened. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/488805626043043840))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
The CC damage threshold on beta is much smaller than live. It reminds me of Wrath which I enjoyed. Is it going to stay this way?<br />
Yes it should (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/488763378890854400))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
-game lore is often debated, but can this be cleared up? Tides of War=No prisoners/civies is wrong or was it lvl designer choice?<br />
The Theramore civilians may not have come from that battle. They may have been captured in S. Barrens or Dustwallow. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/489152935180267520))<br />
<br />
Will we find out what made Khadgar de-age and have Atiesh? Is he “our” Khadgar?<br />
Not de-aged. Just freshly-shaved. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/489152449077202945))<br />
Amazing how much better Azeroth razors are than Outland! I guess Fel Iron can’t get that close <br />
Haha &quot;First blade lifts hair, second blade cuts it, third blade sears and cauterizes flesh for an incredibly close shave.&quot; (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/489153572123078657))<br />

It's not a complaint. It's a fact. The beta servers are unstable and lag ridden. Adding more people does nothing but add more issues. <br />

<br />
Complaint =/= lies or facts. They have no correlation with eachother.<br />
<br />
Also, the purpose of beta testing is to FIND these issues and FIX them, not to play a little demo of the game. If they did not add more people, then these issues would never arise and never be fixed. It's called stress testing, and even when there isn't invites for the purpose of stress testing, issues that arrive due to more beta testers is always valuable information and you should probably let blizzard know about it on the forums. Regardless, just because your microsoft toaster lags when you play does not mean blizzard should stop inviting testers, that's rather self-centered. It's only been a week of beta; of course there will be lots of issues. Considering the fallacies in your response, perhaps common sense is not your strong suit and don't flatter yourself about him making an account, that's probably a coincidence and even if it isn't, he obviously had a point to be made.</div></div><hr />

Make leather look like leather and so on with other materials, it's not all plate.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, I should be glad...the more time until the expansion pre-patch, the more time to finish CM's on my alts.</div></div><hr />

Is he “our” Khadgar? How can he be other Khadgar? WoD is set in the new dimension, where Alliance never got to Draenor because they had no reason or means to. There is no alternative Alleria, Turalyon or Khadgar there. If I'm wrong please respond with explanation.</div></div><hr />

If you want the lore/story that will be an additional 29.95 USD to purchase the novel form of WoW because I an guaranfking-T it will never be explained in game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah I noticed that too, they definitely made that on purpose. Also iirc we might get to visit Karazhan in the pre-expansion quest. That would explain where Khadgar got the staff from.</div></div><hr />

What, are you the one person on earth who didn't want to see Gruul come back or something?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Common sense is obviously not your strong suit but I do find it amusing you made an account just to reply to my post.<br />
<br />
Don't be so dense. It is foolish to comment at all about beta servers being laggy/unstable. Thats why they are beta and not live. You aren't there for a smooth play experience; you're there to test features and provide feedback about them--and no, &quot;laggy&quot; and &quot;unstable&quot; is not meaningful feedback.</div></div><hr />
