Legion - Additional 3D Armor Pieces<br />
In Legion, some armor sets will finally have additional 3D pieces, rather than the few limited shapes per piece that have been used in the past. Currently these are mostly used on the Tier 19 / PvP armor sets. These new pieces have to be modified for each race and gender, similar to helms. <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is an early preview and not finished artwork!<br />

I know. It's about damn time. I was hoping for exactly this for legion, but when i saw the original t19s I was a bit let down. I was also a bit disappointed that I didn't like the DH tier, but with the added features, I love the new mythic DH set, especially the darker/red set.<br />
<br />
The DH and Rogue set (luckily, likely my two mains for Legion, woo!) look great. Question is, will I be able to do Mythic in Legion... Hopefully some of these cool sets are 2k+ arena, because I have more confidence in that than me actually doing Mythic.</div></div><hr />

Why would you think about doing anything cool with a class theme set around magic when you can just put some scrolls under the shoulders and be done with it. It's not like we missed the burning scroll set so much we wanted a remake.</div></div><hr />

<br />
if you think about it ... this is bloody progress. We only had 3 types for glove models, and 4 for the boots, skin boot &amp; glove included. Now they are venturing with adding further customization to existent models. It might first start with added meshes near those gear pieces that aren't morphed like the chest, pants, boots, and gloves. We already have morphed gear on the shoulders, head, and belt. Little by little, the time will come when all gear pieces start to morph into new geometries.<br />
<br />
<br />
Edit 1:<br />
I just don't think the Demon Hunter armor set is as good ... meh meh. I also don't like ... more meh ... just because a player doesn't raid Mythic.<br />

<br />
Well, either they want to encourage more players to do mythic...or more likely: They want more players to buy a spot in mythic raids with gold...and for that buy and sell more wow-tokens.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all the armor sets are detailed and well made and apply to the theme of the class so damn well.<br />
<br />
the warlock and plate sets are ESPECIALLY amazing with. The new dimensions and 3D objects work well. I may just leave my current mogs behind on my rogue and stick with the tier when i get it.<br />

they really took these to the next level.</div></div><hr />

There were only ever geosets for boots and gloves before. They've always worked the same way as hairstyles (and robes, tabards, cloaks, etc.), just changing the geometry of the mesh with the skin on top.<br />
<br />
These new vambraces, tassets, and greaves work the same way weapons, helmets, pauldrons, and buckles work: they're full 3D models that are &quot;pinned&quot; to the character model.</div></div><hr />

Paladins look bad ass, DK's look bad ass. They both have very detailed armor with the new layered / 3d armor. Warriors have the same looking pre-legion (generic) armor with what looks like the belt buckle tacked on to the gloves and the boots. I'll put money on DK set being the first set they worked on and warrior the last set and they were just out of ideas and fucks to give.</div></div><hr />

That's fine, you like it, my opinion is that it sucks. I am not trying to convince anyone, and to argue what I think vs what you think is dog shit.<br />

Though you'd definitely change your tune if you found out later that the DK armor is actually warrior armor, and the warrior armor was the DK set.</div></div><hr />

As my main is a warrior, I only like the yellow version (last of them) which is okay cool. The rest of them looks decent, but not more or less than I would expect. Would be cool if the tier sets *visuals* was unlocked from non raiding, so we could get all of them :)<br />

<br />
As a long time heroic raider I think the amount of stuff they lock behind a mythic only wall is getting a bit ridiculous, and the only reason I can't do it anymore is because I burnt myself out hardcore raiding for 8 years and now I just don't have the time or the connections to find a guild or put up with making my own pug like I used to every week back in wrath.</div></div><hr />

Plus quiver only for marksmans...so not every hunter. And the tier looks just, well what is the word...&quot;Not Epic&quot;. It is kind of &quot;Meh! Trasmong.&quot; The short sleeve just looks sloppy...it gives kind of &quot;leveling starting zone&quot; feel :D</div></div><hr />

However, I find kind of sad or weird that demon hunters have this tier set. Blizz created cool tattoos and blindfolds and first think they did by creating this sets is cover all those cool features. What is the point for DM to have demon eyes/blindfold and tattoos if you cannot show it. (And yeah I know I can choose not to show helmet but still there is no such option for chest...just trying to make the point.)</div></div><hr />

IF that was the color combination it would be actually great!!! <br />
<br />
Here is what I think of some sets:<br />
<br />
Death Knight:<br />
- Looks interesting but colors are way off, too bright and too shinny armor for a Death Knight. The he worst part is that in some color variations the Helm and Chest looks a bit off the gradient of the rest of the set. I don't understand the use of bright yellow and cooper on a DK set.<br />
- Helm still looks bad, too small for such a bulky armor, and gives the feeling of an owl looking from the inside. Reminds me a LOT of the WoD Blacksmith Set Helm sadly. <br />
- Overall was expecting more, was expecting something as awesome as the Challenge Mode set or at least ICC level. The changes they made to the gloves helps a bit but the set is too bulky for my taste.<br />
<br />
Paladin:<br />
- Some colors are a bit off like the darkish and the green on.<br />
- Really like that they removed the skirt and used pants instead. <br />
- There is something about the shoulders that I don't like but I not sure what. Overall I really like the set.<br />
<br />
Warrior:<br />
- I barely have words... Like what on earth is that? I guess I can pretend to imagine the spikes are Deathwing related but we already had a set like that in Cata and it was quite well done, this one on the other hand is like a piece of recycled garbage, literally. Even the back of the chest piece looks removed from the DK set. I really can't find anything good to say about the set.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlock:<br />
- Really really well made, they got the concept of the class and made an amazing set. Well picked colors and tones, darker and not shiny, I don't understand why couldn't they made something like this for DKs.</div></div><hr />

Why would you think about doing anything cool with a class theme set around magic when you can just put some scrolls under the shoulders and be done with it. It's not like we missed the burning scroll set so much we wanted a remake.<br />

I seriously doubt WoWs engine will ever be able to handle that though.<br />
I think they could probably create some more sophisticated geosets for chest and robe pieces, but it might be tough to get it working correctly.<br />
<br />
I think there's a (slim) chance that we'll eventually see them implement cloth physics, which might be a way to improve the appearance of robes and capes, if nothing else. They've got some preliminary physics in place for tassels and such, and they've got the flail weapons working... but it would be a clipping nightmare if they don't get collision detection working correctly.<br />

If they manage that, they can just drape them from the waist and have them interact with the legs naturally using the cloth physics. They could then presumably do some more sophisticated stuff like have assymetrical robes, trench coats, etc.</div></div><hr />

All the other sets look good downgraded but the shoulders on that lock set are very lackluster. They remind me of something I would get at low levels as a quest reward. I hope they get reworked a little because losing the orb and extra beef on the side, coupled with loosing the extra horns from the helm, makes the models look like they are unfinished to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TIER<br />
<br />
In general, the model looks pretty decent. Boots and belt look very &quot;MAIL-ISH&quot; despite the warior's and DK's plate piecies that looks pretty heavy plate and they are AWASOME updates. As for the leg piece I'm glad that the robe looking legs are off, it was more &quot;HOLYS&quot; appearence. The new shoulder is descent. Shoulders and head are really really good.<br />
<br />
All in one i think the tier paladin needs a bit more plate prospective heavy looking. <br />
<br />
HOLY ARTIFACT WEAPON<br />
<br />
As for the artifact weapon I read about lvling in holy spec and staff, now I saw the Libram-book and it's not looks bad, but I would like to ask how this is going to effect the hole movement and basic skills of holy Paladins. To me it seems just a book. Is it better off? Or do we need more info about it in the Libram lore?<br />
<br />
I hope to see a constructive discusion about the matter in the comment section.<br />

and i know this is too much, but i sorta wished that each spec have unique armor sets as well. i mean seems kinda weird for an outlaw rogue, which is pirate themed, dressing like the t19 set. more for assa/sub rogue.</div></div><hr />

I think armors sets from now on, will be less generic. Hopefully.<br />
That is amazing news.<br />
<br />
All the plate sets are excellent, and some of the others, namely the rogue, that hit the nail right on the head. <br />
Cloths are a lil bit underwhelming, i think a bit bigger impact is needed on the robe style thingies. Altho i dont think everyone would be pleased with a sudden direction change in cloth armor design. Who knows...<br />
<br />
As for the other extra objects, the quiver is damn well good, looks nice and is a very appreciated addon to the feeling of being a HUNTER.<br />
<br />
The libram is also nice, but i feel the clipping issue could make it a visual annoyance after some time.</div></div><hr />

Because of that psychotic need to bitch and cry whenever Blizzard does literally anything that so many people on here seem to have. <br />
I'll take what I can get, this has been on my wishlist since &quot;HD&quot; armor textures were introduced in WOTLK, really happy to be getting it!</div></div><hr />

I'd rather have sets like we had pre-Cata where we got interesting and distinctive characteristics for the armors. All 3 plate sets have bucket helms and the only real distinction is the crap on the shoulders and the requisite &quot;paladin skirt&quot;.<br />
<br />
Also, I'm a DK, and yes, we are death knights, but let's try getting an original design that doesn't look like Generic Plate Set #1829 With Skulls Bolted On. Tier 18 actually had a really cool idea going with the horned hood, but the rest of the set dropped the ball.</div></div><hr />

Just because you don't like something does not mean everyone should dislike it. By the way, there's transmog if you feel the armor sets are not to your liking. That is one of the main reasons it was implemented for. Personally, I love all the tier sets. They all have something special going on... But the demon hunter one is a bit impractical. They cover the parts where the tattoos would be. As well as the helm should show off the many blindfolds and horns of demon hunters.<br />
<br />
EDIT: I think the reason why I love all these tier sets is because of the amount of detail in them. It's really amazing. The art team is amazing and working real hard this time around. I think I am more fascinated with the amount of detail then whether it looks &quot;good&quot; or not.</div></div><hr />
