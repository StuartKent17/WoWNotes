Here's my take. Blizzard *has* to make this (relatively) easy if they want to stick by their &quot;we are focusing more for the casual raider. What percentage of WoW players never even saw C'thun? What percentage of WoW players ever came even close to seeing Kel'Thuzad? Blizzard doesn't want a boss that only *maybe* 300 people from their 30 million+ user base to see. What's the point is spend all the time creating, tuning, etc. on a boss for 300 people? The top guilds will always find a way to entertain themselves. D&amp;T had Kel'Thuzad on farm, so what do they do? They go see if they can do Hakkar without killing any aspects. They find ways to make the game for difficult. Onyxia was too easy for a 40-raid? How about a 20-raid? How about 6, 5 or 4 people? The top guilds will always find something to do. Now, the 'second tier' of guilds... they just want to see the next boss, get to the next kill. However, encountering a fight like C'thun, or The Four Horsemen, or Kel'thuzad required such a ridiculous level of time and commitment that very few people ever saw it, and all that work was wasted. Make a boss easier, and more people will get to see it. More people who see new content means more people who will keep playing means more money.<br />

You migth be right, but again how many people will be able to complete the prequest to Black Temple after all? You gotta be pretty hardcore to get that far. I'm fine with it, but it's not easy to find enough people that want to be that dedicated to the game.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">galvin</div><div class="date">2007-06-04, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This guild shouldn't be used as a guide to say this is easy. How many people sit out on each encounter. Do they have 40 to 100 people saved or what. But the previous poster is right, what fun is content if you can never see it or get to it before the next expansion. <br />

I probably wont see black temple till late fall. Right now we're on the second boss in SSC, we haven't even done any TK yet. So we got a long way to go.</div></div><hr />
