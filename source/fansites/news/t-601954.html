You all know that you will need a &quot;decent&quot; rating to buy arena season 3 weapons, but in this blue posts, Drysc mentions the fact that this isn't a definite and final change ... Anyway it shouldn't be more than 1800 or 1900 so it won't be that hard. <br />
A weapon isn't going to keep your 1300 team from competing with the best teams.<br />
<br />
The change is being made to help keep the nice PvP rewards for the good PvP players, and the nice PvE rewards for the good PvErs. Having the weapons there is too tempting for PvE players to come in, not care about PvP, their team, or rating, and jump in just long enough to go for the weapons and then leave. It's not exactly in-line with the team and ladder based PvP competition the arenas are there for.<br />
<br />
Also, there's been no announcement on a final rating. I remember hearing 1800 at BlizzCon, some people say they heard 1900, in any case it's likely to be around there but there's still no final number announced... or even if it's a definite and final change.<br />

PvP Titles<br />
You can expect more titles in the future, including old titles back from the grave. <br />
More titles will be introduced to the game in the future, and some of the old PvP titles may likely be reintroduced to the game as well at some point in time, however we have no more specific information on this available to us at this point in time. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't really know anything about tabards, but I too would love to see more of those being introduced to the game... I like flavour, so it could indeed be cool to see more tabards like ones that are common and can easily be purchased or crafted, but also more rare or unique ones that can only be gained through quests or reputation rewards or are rare drops and loot.<br />

I don't see this happening. Its more likely to work just like R14 weaps. Where you just need the rating to obtain weap then you can drop as low as you want and still use it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Am I reading these blizz quotes wrong or something? Where are ppl getting the idea that rating mean you have to stay at that rating to use the weapon? Also, hard for low rating teams to get gear? Its only weapons that are getting rating. You can still lose your way to full s3 gear as far as things have been shown. This is just r14 weapons all over again just a lot easier to go about than GM/HW was.</div></div><hr />

I don't know what exactly a low score is for you. But a 1300 rating group isn't handicapped because of the lack of good items and such teams won't be playing against dull S2 teams.</div></div><hr />

Sunfire requires a primal might (around 100g on my server) as opposed to Soulfrost's 6 primal shadows (about a gold each on my server). What a ****ing joke.<br />

On another note, I think the 1900 or so rating will just be required to purchase the item. Kinda like how in pre-BC you just needed to obtain the rank &quot;High Warlord&quot; or &quot;Grand Marshall&quot; to buy the weapons, but didn't need to stay that rank to use the weapons/gear. This 1900 cap is just there so people don't put in a half-assed effort, do their 10 games and get decent points for the (very good) weapons.</div></div><hr />

You won't be handicapped in the arenas because of this, I bet they'll remove the previous season's gear's point cap, so when Season 4 rolls around, Season 3 will be usable by all etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lets wait till we know the exact numbers for the weapons. But I wonder why anyone thinks S3 Weapons should be &quot;free loot&quot;. How many guilds are allready in Bt/Hyjal and have access to these weapons? I guess the percantage is lower than 1900+ arena teams. BC is allready so much of a free loot. Both, my main and my twink are covered in purples and to have access to the best weapons ingame too is pretty unfair. (IMO) I'll stick to S2 weapon and T2 Craftweapon. Sooner or later I'll have the necessary rating for a S3 weapon (currently around 1800 in 3vs3) and I bet my twink gets a S3 weapon sooner than my priest. ;)</div></div><hr />

Mmmhh, not really. While I won't comment on the disparate cost of materials (/care) it is simply not true that firemages outdamage or outscale locks, quite on the opposite. Even if you don't take into account the superior sustainability (mana regen resources), a destro lock - that it is not even seen as the best damaging lock spec, but it is the most similar to mages, hence providing easier comparison - will outdamage a fire lock, as a fully buffed and talented ShadowBolt will outscale a fully buffed and talented Fireball.</div></div><hr />

It's pretty obvious imho... Nobody can do Frost AND Shadowdamage so you can only use half of the enchant, thats why its comparatively cheap. Sunfire on the other hand gives an arcane/fire mage an upgrade for his fire and his arcane casts, thats why its more expensive because, item budget wise, it is a bigger gain (at least for some).</div></div><hr />

<br />
Ask a fire mage whether he would prefer a +54 fire dmg enchant or a +50 fire/arc ench (or a +54 arc dmg to a arcane mage). Fact is that, unless you are going to &quot;cross over&quot; in the near future (e.g. T5 dropping and going to arcane due to the bonus set), mages rarely use other school spells other than their primary one, at least in raids.<br />
<br />
There is an important exception in AOE'ing fire mages - arcane explosions are quite used.</div></div><hr />

You are missing my point, I wasn't arguing the usefulness of the enchant I was just trying to explain the reasoning behind the price of it. And the fact remains, there is not one class/spec that would be able to use shadow and frost +dmg but there is a class/spec that could use fire and arcane +dmg and thats why the enchant is more expensive.<br />

I honestly don't care if anyone uses these enchants, imho both are to expensive for the small gain compared to +40 spelldmg.</div></div><hr />

Well they should practice more and get better at the game. The weapons are rewards. Blizzard doesn't (and shouldn't) want to just hand them out to anyone.<br />

The better players deserve the better gear/items. <br />

Mmmh, I see. Anyway, if so imho the logic is a bit flawed (on Blizzard's behalf, not yours) - will they change the price (actually, I think the main issue wasn't the price, but the effect +50 vs +54) - if a class arises that can use both schools? DK seemingly will be able to use frost and shadow (ofc it is still in a early development stage and hard info is not abudant...).<br />
<br />
Btw, I fully agree with you regarding the price/gain issue ;D<br />
<br />
Anyway, on a completely different subject, how serious is Blizzard taking the Arena concept as competitive play in WOW? Personally it feels that lots of the issues could be solved either by:<br />
-making all arena items unusable outside it. And either supplying players with top of the line gear base for arena play (that at least match the top PVE gear) or not allowing players to use outside gear in the arenas;<br />
-Making the PVP items undesirable outside, including the weapons<br />
<br />
Could the arena benefit from a GW like concept (everyone has the same quality lvl gear for PVP), being the rewards more of a symbolic nature?</div></div><hr />

I can't really say what the problem is with getting over the 1500 cap but it has something to do with &quot;player skills&quot;. People with such low ratings usually have problems with game mechanics, proper key bindings, reaction, movement, class knowledge and so on. No gear in this world would compensate this. A mage who's a keyboard turner won't get a spell through unless its an instant. I've seen so many bad players and let me tell you one thing, gear is not the way to help them. You need a shitload of info in PvP and especially in arena PvP. It's not easy to know all this when you're logging in 2-3 hours a week. But as I said, whats the point in giving out some purples for nothing? In the end it doesn't help anyone. <br />
<br />
My 2 cents even if I know it's a little harsh.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Could the arena benefit from a GW like concept (everyone has the same quality lvl gear for PVP), being the rewards more of a symbolic nature?<br />
<br />
I dont think that such a concept will work in a community like WoW. The focus is too much on items nowadays. Personally I would like it. It makes you more competetive even if you dont have the necessary items. When I think of my priest and his godly 50 points of resilience I'll know that I can't hit the 1900+ cap when I feel like to PvP. At some point the lack of arena items is too high when you're facing the 1900+ groups who are usally suited in 300+ resilience. But then &quot;timesink&quot; comes in my mind and this is what Blizzard really wants. ;) A character who is well played has the chance to stand against these 1900+ groups in around 2 months.</div></div><hr />

I earned 250 points last week (yes, i got smoked like a cheap cigar . . . everytime). So it will take me appox. 15 weeks to save up for a 2-handed wpn. (and thats based on being able to stay around a 1300 rating each week) <br />
<br />
Are all of you seriously saying that after 15 weeks of being smoked by all you &quot;hardcore&quot; pvpers that i dont deserve that wpn no matter what my current rating is?<br />
<br />
Please note that i didnt say that it shouldnt take me 15 weeks to get it. If i cant do better than that, then i dont deserve it any sooner. but dont sit here and tell me that i shouldnt be able to get the damned thing after waiting so long.<br />
<br />
This desire of &quot;l33tness&quot; is going to drive you hardcorers (i dont care if it isnt a word =P ) right into long queue times, less competetion and lower ratings.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change is being made to help keep the nice PvP rewards for the good PvP players, and the nice PvE rewards for the good PvErs. Having the weapons there is too tempting for PvE players to come in, not care about PvP, their team, or rating, and jump in just long enough to go for the weapons and then leave. It's not exactly in-line with the team and ladder based PvP competition the arenas are there for.<br />
<br />
Also, there's been no announcement on a final rating. I remember hearing 1800 at BlizzCon, some people say they heard 1900, in any case it's likely to be around there but there's still no final number announced... or even if it's a definite and final change.<br />

This is a contradiction because the best arena teams are usually the best geared PVE'rs. T6/S2 &gt; S2 <br />

Just say the best PVE'rs get the best gear period and I'll be satisfied.</div></div><hr />

I would agree on that, then again, if they make it as hard to get to GM (or to HWL) as before... I don't think you'll be seeing THAT many more new marshals, as most people pvp just enough to get some gear and then move on to either arenas or pve... so yea, let's hope it'll take more than AV weekend farming to get there....</div></div><hr />

These ratings will only affect the S3 weapons. <br />
And let me add one thing. Imagine a really weak group of, lets say Warri/Pala Combo spends all his points in the S3 weapon when it comes out. Next thing, he enters the arena and hits the shit out of a little caster who has just some blue stamina items. You think this would be balanced or fun? Ok, for you it would be fun ;) but for any caster it would be hell on earth. Weapons like the S3 weapons will be, arent balanced for this arena rating.

It would be no more fun than the 10-15 weeks that same warrior has spent getting pwnerized by people who have that same gear so he could get that single weapon. You are entering the gear vs skill debate, after weeks of being trashed the warrior has earned his shiny sword much more in my book than someone highly skilled who romped to getting the same in 3 weeks or do you think its easier to spend 3 months losing again and again than it is to spend 1 month winning all round you?<br />
<br />
And lets be honest here, this change if implemented is gonna totally screw over the people who do genuinely put in the time and slog their way through for months with 1360 ratings to get a couple items because the high rating teams who already have all their gear are now selling arena points to others to get great gear in a few weeks since it no longer matters to them if they win or lose. The stupidity of it is that it is going to punish the low ranked players to fix an issue that is being created by the high ranked players which is part of why it the idea stinks so much. If they really want to prevent people getting quick arena weapons just tie the arena weapons to total Arena games won. Require a total of 250 lifetime arena victories before you can use an arena weapon and now anyone who does a lot of arena can get and use them eventually and it also makes the effort needed to boost other players too severe for people to bother.<br />
<br />
The real problem comes down to how much more important the weapon is for a melee character than any other slot. Going from a 93 dps to a 126 dps weapon makes a huge difference to your damage output, probably as much as you will get from upgrading most of your other gear combined. A far more sensible option would be to reduce the rate at which base DPS on melee weapons scales and instead spread that extra DPS around between the other gear.<br />
<br />
If for example the Merciless Glad 2H weapons had 106 average damage and Blizz put an average of 10 extra strength (or 20 AP) on every other melee equipment slot (including neck, ring, trinkets etc) the end DPS is about the same but it is no longer focussed entirely into a single item. This makes weapon upgrades less overpowering and other slot upgrades more meaningful for melee characters which I think is something most would be quite happy with since right now once you have a decent weapon the rest is just gravy. It would probably also make it easier to finally fix melee DPS to not be so totally gear dependant since a single item slot doesn't factor so heavily in determining your DPS.</div></div><hr />

<br />
In fact, this would be a really good idea. It would need a massive rebalance around PvE and PvP items but I guess we'll never see such changes. I think that Blizz and the players are a little bit proud of there big weapons. If you face an enemy who is a melee char the first thing you look at will be the weapon he is holding. It's kind of a psychological thing and IMO it should stay intact as it is. Lorewise its the same thing. Big weapon, big damage. :) Nonetheless it would be the right step in (maybe) a more balanced WoW PvP system. Character improvement would be more linear and not so steep or should I say exponantial like it is now. Caster allready have this &quot;linear&quot; improvement, maybe we will see this in WotLK but I'm very skeptical.</div></div><hr />

Yes! this is what i was trying to say. Thank you. lol<br />

Putting a requirement like this was Blizzards intent to do 2 things:<br />

1. To make it so you can't lose your way to a weapon and use weapons that people who actually have succeeded in arena.<br />

By the same token how do you reckon they felt when you get gladiator status because you can afford to spend two months with your guildie doing nothing except playing arena all day? And like it or not they are already penalised for the low rating by getting very few arena points each week. If you got gladiator status in two months without picking up the weapon then either you were playing a caster or you already had a very good weapon.<br />
<br />
I'm sorry if I sound kind of harsh but if your enjoyment of the game is lessened by seeing others in better gear than you I see it as nothing less than a reflection of your own poor self esteem or selfishness. You hate to see someone less skilled have some fun? Get a life. Sadly this attitude seems to be fairly common among a lot of PvPers who can happily in the same breath claim that they could achieve their success regardless of gear since it is all skill while decrying the fact that someone who may not be that skilled but who puts in a lot of time and effort can get some gear which then allows him to beat some random noob.<br />
<br />
Your two reasons for this change are wrong. It is to address people who get high rated players to rating farm them a gladiator weapon in a couple of weeks. Punishing people who have played honestly at a low rating does nothing to address this since it in no way prevents team hopping abuses that are going on at present. Nevermind that right now your arena rating doesn't decay so you can just stop playing when it is 1901 and never lose your weapon while someone who plays everyday always takes a chance of losing their weapon.<br />
<br />
Also I said make them have to win 250 games, not play 250 games. It would certainly at least show that they were either unskilled and very persistent or skilled, either way that means they put in a lot of effort for the reward while a 1900 rating can just mean you had 4 mates switch to your team, boost your rating and then swap back to their own team for the rest of the week (and for a favour you can of course then sign up for arena at the same time as them and throw a few games, welcome to the wonderful and sadly very common world of arena abuse).<br />
<br />
Thats the stupidity, this change does nothing to prevent the abuses that people are complaining about. The people complaining are those who are happy to accept their 1500 ratings and don't try to exploit their way beyond that. It is just funny that blizzard are penalizing those who complain by introducing a stupid system that will have little or no effect on the people who actually are abusing the system.</div></div><hr />

I meant that how many matches were played should be a factor in how many points you get for the week. <br />
<br />
For example, 2 teams have a rating of 1300 each. Team A did 10 matches and Team B did 15 matches. Team B would get more points than Team A.<br />
<br />
The complaint that a lower rated player shouldnt have access to the same gear as a higher rated player is bs. If 2 ppl are both farming mats for a craftable wpn, just b/c one of them takes 3 times as long to get it doesnt mean they shouldnt be able to get it. The &quot;reward&quot; for the higher rated player is having the better wpn first/longer and all the other gear they can buy as the low rated player saves up the points for that one item.<br />

<br />
First off, I didn't spend two months playing non-stop arena all day. I'm actually in a PvE guild and I raid most of my time. Both of us have school and work to attend so we only did arena 10-15 games on the weekends.(Sometimes more if we both didn't have hw for the weekend) I'm not lessened by the game bcause other people have better gear than I. It's a sense of accomplishment when you do good things in the game, especially one where its all about character development and the biggest character development is lvling and gear. Secondly, there is no need for personal attacks. I'm not here to flame anyne. I was just stating what my personal comments were on this subject as did everyone else who posted. Your disagreement with my opinion doesn't validate your comments made at my life. <br />
<br />
Now, I do agree that this does not fix the problem of people buying their way into teams to get a rating and just sit there to attain their weapons. I'm hoping blizzard will be able to fix this in a way, possibly they have to play 10 games a week to prevent the decay of arena rating or something. And the Blue posts on forums as well as Blizzcon did mention that the reason they want a rating requirement was to reward the good pvpers and not allow some pve'ers to just come in and tank their rating every week and end up with a weapon that they can compete in arenas with. <br />
<br />
Like you said, you wanted a requirement of something like 250 won games to be able to buy or use the weapon (whatever blizzard announces). They can either be unskilled and persistent or skilled and get it. But then it goes against what Blizzard intended for arena to be, a ladder based PvP that awards good pvp players. <br />
<br />
<br />
Phalen: I agree with your example. Makes sense that Team B shuld be awarded more because they risked their rating more than Team A. However, farming mats for a craftable weapon and arena are way different things. Arena is to award skill over time invested. Farming just takes time and anyone could go and do it.</div></div><hr />

But, helas, maybe Blizz is not serious about it - just insterested in providing a fun distraction to customers (e.g. enticing them to keep up payin the sub *cough* *cough*). in this case I go with the sugestion of making access to new weapons /.../ based upon the number opf victories.

I've got an opposite view.<br />
<br />
I don't care if you've spent 3 weeks or 3 months trying to save up for a weapon. If you're getting thrashed all the time, and are in a badly rated team, you simply don't deserve the item.<br />
<br />
Should blizzard start handing out boss loot for free if a guild wipes 50 times on the same boss? No. If you can't do it, you shouldn't just get the items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Essentially what you're wanting is the worse players obtaining the same kick ass gear as the good players, but for less effort.<br />
<br />
It's damned easy to play 10 matches a week, lose all the time in 5v5 match for a few weeks, and get items, than actually putting in an effort, planning out attacks, and striving for a high rating. If you're in a good arena team, with a high rating, every single match is on the line. A loss is a big thing.</div></div><hr />

Well, yes that's exactly what it means. Yeah you might bust your ass and put in 100%, but if you're still getting your ass kicked, and your ratings suck, I'm sorry you don't deserve the item.<br />
<br />
Should a person who got a silver medal in the 100m sprint be given the gold, just because they might have trained longer and harder than the person that came first?<br />

I'm sorry, but the better players deserve the better items. It defeats the purpose of PvP if any scrub can get all the great items.<br />

I really do hope Blizz enforces a rating cap or equip requirements or something to stop people just farming arena 10 matches a week to get incredibly good weapons that will last till Black Temple.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem is if you take away the rewards for the low rated players they will just stop playing and when that happens everyone else's rating drops too. The reason there are a good few 2000+ teams is because there are a lot of 1800+ teams they can beat to gain rating, there are lots of 1800+ teams because there is a huge amount of 1500 teams they can beat to get up their rating. For the system to work there has to be a broad range of player abilities competing. If you remove the rewards from the lower rated teams they just won't bother to play and the whole system will collapse. So while some players sit on their 2100 rating bemoaning the fact that 1300 rated teams get the occasional epic they are missing the whole point that if not for those players losing a lot there wouldn't be any high rated teams for them to compete against. <br />
<br />
Tieing gear to rating as you suggest also would tend to reinforce the status quo. It makes it harder to break into the top ratings because you would always be at a gear disadvantage and as such discourages healthy competition.<br />
<br />
The arena system does need some fixing but I can think of plenty better things to change.<br />
<br />
Increase the minimum number of games required per week for starters. Ten is too low, make it 10 to get points but 25 to get your full proportion of points for that week.<br />
Restrict the number of team members for each band, 3 members for 2v2, 4 for 3v3, 7 for 5v5. Also restrict how easy it is to move between teams. Let people only leave and join 1 team in each band per week and don't let them leave a team and rejoin it the same week.<br />
<br />
Just that two changes fixes most of the current issues, it fixes the problem of people getting great rewards for minimal time played and also should curb most of the high level point farming exploits and right now those seem to be the two main complaints.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Legionn</div><div class="date">2007-09-06, 09:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">What they could also do is make a set of gear for the higher rating teams so they won't QQ as much about others having the same gear and not doing as much for it. This set would be better in stats and maybe it would be an original gear set instead of a skin color change. Once you reach that point in the ratings you should only be facing other in that area of rating so it would still be possible to reach it. Everyone still starts off at 1500 rating at the beginning so you'll have to use some pts to get the new gear then once you reach, let's say, 1900 you'll be spending more for the top rated gear. I'm sure there's flaws in there somewhere but you can't please everybody.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, but there are plenty 1800 point teams because whenever one of them loses a few games they beat a couple of 1700 point teams to get back up. The 1700 point teams then beat a couple 1600 point teams to get back up and they in turn beat a couple 1500 point teams. <br />
<br />
Ok, go back to when season 2 started. Everyone was on 1500 and from there presumably about half the teams have gone up in rating and about half have gone down. If the system was set up such that only teams who reach high ratings get rewards then the half who were losing wouldn't have bothered to play, why should they when there is no benefit to them from doing so (ok maybe some would just for fun but assume that most wouldn't if there was no rewards for doing so).<br />
<br />
So now you have a situation where only half as many teams are competing since all those who weren't going to succeed see it is a waste of time. But now half of those remaining are going to be losing and because those they could beat have pulled out they will now get no rewards. The level of ability that used get you an 1800 point rating is now only sufficient to get a 1500 point rating since all the below average teams have pulled out. They can no longer recieve any benefit because the teams they were going to beat to get those benefits have stopped playing, so they will now stop playing. You will very quickly see a big decline in the number of teams competing with a corresponding drop in the possible arena ratings you can achieve.<br />
<br />
What I am saying is that without all the teams filling up the lower end of the arena point spectrum there would not be a healthy higher arena point rating section and anything that discourages those teams from competing will lower the achievable points ratings for the other teams.</div></div><hr />

It would be no more fun than the 10-15 weeks that same warrior has spent getting pwnerized by people who have that same gear so he could get that single weapon. You are entering the gear vs skill debate, after weeks of being trashed the warrior has earned his shiny sword much more in my book than someone highly skilled who romped to getting the same in 3 weeks or do you think its easier to spend 3 months losing again and again than it is to spend 1 month winning all round you?<br />
<br />
Yes! this is what i was trying to say. Thank you. lol<br />
<br />
i really dont think a ratings restriction is the answer. Maybe, the arena points rewards system should factor in how many games you play as well. so those that play more get rewarded more. just an idea.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I've got an opposite view.<br />
<br />
I don't care if you've spent 3 weeks or 3 months trying to save up for a weapon. If you're getting thrashed all the time, and are in a badly rated team, you simply don't deserve the item.<br />
<br />
Should blizzard start handing out boss loot for free if a guild wipes 50 times on the same boss? No. If you can't do it, you shouldn't just get the items.<br />
<br />
<br />
Essentially what you're wanting is the worse players obtaining the same kick ass gear as the good players, but for less effort.<br />
<br />
It's damned easy to play 10 matches a week, lose all the time in 5v5 match for a few weeks, and get items, than actually putting in an effort, planning out attacks, and striving for a high rating. If you're in a good arena team, with a high rating, every single match is on the line. A loss is a big thing.<br />
<br />
I dont think that comparing PvE rewards vs effort and PvP rewards vs effort is fair. I dont know anywhere in the PvE world you can 2 or even 3 man stuff to get epics with comparable stats to SSC/The Eye/BT gear. If you go that route then a team should have a rating of 2500 or better for any of the gear.<br />
<br />
As it stands now, I think that the Arena rewards time and effort (just like all PvP in WoW does). Even the old honor system did, if you PvP'd enough, you gained rank and access to gear. The good PvPers (just like the good PvEers) should get rewarded more faster.<br />
<br />
My last point: Alot of ppl keep saying that the low rated team get rewarded for no effort. i call Bs. Win or Lose, most of the team are trying to win. They are trying just as hard as the high rated teams. and im here to tell you, no matter what my rating is, im trying hard to win and losing sucks. So dont say that im getting anything for free.<br />

You compared farming materials for crafted items as the same as PvP. That is way more far-fetched than PvE vs PvP. Like you said, nowhere besides Arena can you 2/3/5 man things to get comparable weapons to SSC/TK/Hyjal/BT. Thus putting a restriction on the gear for arena would allow the good pvpers like pvers to attain such gear. <br />
<br />
I have to agree that if you've spent months losing in pvp or months wiping on a boss and you either cannot get a good rating or you cannot beat that boss, you shouldn't be rewarded so heavily with items. Lemme just say that I'm saying that you put no effort into pvp. I'm damn sure almost everyone tries in arena and does not enjoy losing. <br />
<br />
Blizzard realized its mistake of the old honor system, the old way rewarded time investment. You can lose AV/AB/WSG and still receive honor and rank up. We had a HWL on our server get his rank because he played nearly 17 hours a day and solo'ed wsg/ab trying to get honor. Blizzard meant Arena to be a ladder based pvp that rewarded skilled players in pvp with items that aided them in pvp. The reward is not having the items longer than others or first. <br />
<br />
Like I said, I'm not saying you don't put effort in your pvp. I don't doubt that you play every game to win. But arena is a pvp sytem where losing does hurt you directly in terms of points, whereas the old system did not. I don't think Blizzard wanted people to receive items even though they do not &quot;succeed&quot; in pvp.</div></div><hr />

Every mechanic in this game essentially comes to time spent playing. Skill only determines how much time it takes a player to gear up.<br />
<br />
I compare farming mats/PvP/PvE as basically the same thing. the more time a player spends doing any of those, the better gear they will have.<br />
<br />
If i farmed enough mats and gold, i can have epic gear that has end game stats, just like if i arena/PvP, just like if i was in a guild that hardcore PvEs. Who do we (as a gaming community) respect more? The guy with the crafted gear or the guy decked out in SSC/EYE gear? The same goes for Arena gear. When i see a guy completely decked out in Arena gear, i know he has put his time in, takes it seriously and prolly knows how to PvP (im leaving the whole team swapping issue out, i think its bs too). The true status of PvP/Arena comes from things like titles or how much of a gear set a player has, those things easily seperate the hardcore from the casual players. <br />
<br />
Rating restrictions are going to keep the high rated high and the low rated low. Thats not cool and as its been said before, it will lead to a weak Arena game. Give everyone a the eventual opportunity at something and everyone will come, limit who gets it and a vast majority wont even try. And that eliminates the foundation the high rated teams build themselves on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sick of seeing scrubs who can't pve or pvp running around with +220 weapons. As for the old &quot;i slog and store points for 15 weeks&quot;.... well you can still buy all the armor and that should help you with your arena.<br />
<br />
Access to weapons &quot;THAT GOOD&quot; should only be for people who are able to maintain a decent ranking. Plus you can still buy the s2 weapons so like QQ less please.<br />
<br />
Personally i will never be on a team that will reach 1900, but i'm happy to take all the armor instead.<br />
<br />
I mean lets see for the cost of a 2H 3.7k points, u could have got shoulders + helm/chest or a combination of same.<br />
The stam/res/stats you get from those 2 items will FAR outweigh one weapon.<br />
<br />
if your doing arena to get a PvE weapon.... and saving for 12-15 weeks to do so..... your pretty sad anyway, and taking access to s3 weapons away from you shouldn't matter in the least.<br />
<br />
GET The arena armor first and maybe you will actually get a decent rating<br />
<br />
Plus GIVEN that you can start a new team every week and start back on 1500, how anyone is around 1300 is bizzare... you'd get more points if you just restarted your team each week. Gold is frigging valueless atm anyway, 5 dailles = 60g. that's like 400g a week...<br />
<br />
the elite should be given access to something special (i.e. s3 weapons) while everyone can access the other items. People who can't even clear KZ/Gruul shouldn't be allowed to have weapons &gt; TK/SSC ones. Simple</div></div><hr />

I mean lets see for the cost of a 2H 3.7k points, u could have got shoulders + helm/chest or a combination of same.<br />
The stam/res/stats you get from those 2 items will FAR outweigh one weapon.<br />
<br />
if your doing arena to get a PvE weapon.... and saving for 12-15 weeks to do so..... your pretty sad anyway, and taking access to s3 weapons away from you shouldn't matter in the least.<br />
<br />
GET The arena armor first and maybe you will actually get a decent rating<br />
<br />
Plus GIVEN that you can start a new team every week and start back on 1500, how anyone is around 1300 is bizzare... you'd get more points if you just restarted your team each week. Gold is frigging valueless atm anyway, 5 dailles = 60g. that's like 400g a week...<br />
<br />
the elite should be given access to something special (i.e. s3 weapons) while everyone can access the other items. People who can't even clear KZ/Gruul shouldn't be allowed to have weapons &gt; TK/SSC ones. Simple<br />
<br />
<br />
Lets put some perspective on this, if you started PvP at the start of season 2, playing 5v5 with a 1300 rating and bought nothing else so far you got your 2 hander this week. If you are playing 3v3 or 2v2 with a 1300 rating since the start of season 2 you don't have enough points to get it yet. So those 1300 rating scrubs you describe got their weapons either by saving points for the entire season or longer, or by using some creative point rating tactics to get the points faster. Anyone who has a 2 hander and 1 other season 2 item (assuming they didn't carry over points from season 1) has to have a 1507 5v5 rating, or if they play 2v2 a rating of 1680 or higher. In short, if you are wearing lots of arena gear and have a low rating the only way it was possible is if you had someone artificially boost your rating. That is why the first action that needs to be taken is to prevent that. As I said before, the rating limit on item use is punishing those who play fairly at a low rating because those who have high ratings are abusing the system to get gear for their unskilled mates.<br />
<br />
If you have a merciless 2h and 2 extra merciless items (take the cheapest two) that cost a total of 6375 arena points. Season 2 has been going for 12 weeks that means you need to be getting 532 arena points per week.<br />
<br />
Thats a 1799 2v2 rating, a 1730 3v3 rating and a 1631 5v5 rating. This is the amount of gear people seem to regard as what the 1300 scrubs are getting. I said it before and I'll say it again, if someone on a 1300 rating has that gear they only have it because someone (presumably a skilled someone or group of someones) artificially boosted their rating. The artificial boosting is the problem, fix that and don't put in place some stupid system that punishes those who are playing fair. This is a problem created entirely by (some) high rating teams who are shameless about exploiting the system to gear up their mates, if you want to punish anyone punish them, but don't punish those who have been playing fair all along because some other high rating teams no longer feel special since this rampant exploiting has been allowed to go on for so long. And if the proposed change goes through the only difference in season 3 will be that the exploiters will be wearing full season 3 gear and a season 2 weapon while those who are unskilled but playing fair still won't have anything.</div></div><hr />

Obviously there'd be balancing issues and i have no idea if these bonuses would be over or underpowered its just an example: but it allows low rating teams to get their weapons, but the better pvpers with high rating teams have something to show for their efforts and they're gear scales as they become better pvpers: I know pre-tbc it was something of pride to have lots of yellow highlights on the Tier set bonuses</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know all the self-righteous &quot;I'm 2000 rated the rest are scrubs&quot; people are really missing the key point that another player posted earlier.<br />
<br />
No one can get 1800-1900 rating in S3 if this system is introduced regardless of how good you are. This is because as pointed out earlier if the requirement was introduced people who have no chance to get to that kind of rating will stop going arena. Thus there will not be enough ppl around to provide for the rating. Good teams rating is high because they get to fight though the &quot;scrubs&quot; to get there.<br />
<br />
This fact is already apparent in some low population battlegroups and servers where rating doesn't even go above 2000 for the top teams.<br />
<br />
This is very basic math and human psychology.<br />
<br />
Arena is not like pve, you depend on other people's failure in order for you to succeed. Pve gears is still gonna be obtainable as long as you are good and regardless of how good/scrub others are. Arena gears is NOT going to be obtainable if you have no &quot;scrubs&quot; to push you up.<br />
<br />
People knows they are going to have no chance to get certain gear is simply not going to waste time on it, and rather play for things more achieveable. Simple as that. They r all just gonna stick to heroics and Kara. Thus there won't even be a working arena system anymore.<br />
<br />
So no I totally disagree with this implementation. I think it is totally ill-conceived on Blizzard's part. Simply because it is not going to be workable and collapses the whole system. Sure 1800-1900 is not hard to achieve in s1 or s2, but when this is introduced there won't even be 1800 rating in s3 due to lack of participating population, so kinda defeats the whole point of this concept. <br />
<br />
I think instead they should just introduce legendary arena gears that have limited numbers each week/month and requires like 20k arena pts to get so that it is out of reach of most ppl who are just saving pts for 1 big item but with low ratings. I think at the moment the pts cost for gears are way too low that's why arena gears are outpacing pve gears progression by so damn much.</div></div><hr />

That statement is complete BS, a &quot;scrub&quot; failure could cause you total hell in PvE just as bad as PvP. Unlike PvP all 25 people have to be specifically geared in most cases, and if even one slips up a little it can have dire consequences, not to mention everyone has to shell out a fortune in gold for repairs.<br />
<br />
People who say PvE gear is easier to get then PvP have obviously never been past Karazhan.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No it is not. I wasn't even taking about which was easy and which was hard. I was talking about the basic mechanics of arena.<br />
<br />
I said in pvp your opponent's failure makes you good. You said other ppl's failure in pve drags you down. The two aren't even the same thing or in the same ball park of meaning and you are comprehending the statement in the wrong way.<br />
<br />
Other guild's failure in dungeons DOES NOT improve your guild's progression in dungeon, this is what I meant. In pve your real opponent is the game itself, not against other people. Thus there will always be the same number of and quality of opponents around for you to beat. Thus how other guilds do doesn't affect your progression at all. The fact that they down Gruul doesn't mean that your guild can't also down gruul.<br />
<br />
Arena is totally the opposite. If Blizzard intro the 1900 rating purchase limit, no one will get high ratings, you get much reduced number of opponents in pvp because they forsee that they can't get to 1900 thus not bother to waste time to participate, so there is no scrub people for you to beat to improve your ratings. <br />
<br />
In pve, you can be good regardless of other people because you/guild is doing your own thing against the game. In pvp, you can only be &quot;good&quot; relative to other people. That is the whole point.<br />
<br />
You are missing that entire key point and just choose to pick apart my statement and debate about irrelevant things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No, he is saying that since arena ratings will vary pretty much like any standard statistical distribution then whether they know it or not the high rated teams are feeding off of the low rated teams and any change that discourages those low rated teams from competing will, in fact, reduce the potential rating achievable by the high level teams.<br />
<br />
Whether or not you understand the relationship between population size and achievable arena ratings there is still a very definite correlation. If you are ignorant of the fact it does not in anyway alter the fact that the highest rated teams are feeding indirectly off of the lowest rated teams and without the presence of those teams their potential to gain rating will be diminished.</div></div><hr />

<br />
With that being said, S1 will be purchasable by honor, as will, most likely, those weapons. S2 weapons and armor will also still be available to all, at a lower price like S1 was when S2 came out. Correct me if I'm wrong but a 225 spell damage weapon is better than anything in SSC, as are the healing and damage weapons. <br />
<br />
People should not be rewarded with gear that is on par with T6 just because they save well. Buy the S2 stuff, it's still better than anything you'll probably ever achieve anyway. You're still able to buy the S3 armor and look like T6, which 95% of wow players will never have. Why should you also be given amazing weapons. People who QQ about this have no concept of earning things for themselves. I know plenty of people who grind 10 matches a week to buy arena weapons so they can kick ass in PvE. I will say it once again, if you are buying the weapon first, you have no interest in actually doing well in PvP. Warriors and rogues can go blacksmithing and craft amazing weapons. Spell casters can kill prince and get an awesome dagger. Or these people could just buy S2 gear and stop bitching because Blizzard is willing to just &quot;hand them&quot; Black Temple loot. If anyone can buy amazing S3 weapons, then i want god mode flasks so i can go 10 man BT with some friends. Gear is awarded to those who deserve it, this is not a welfare system.

It's not that you have to have a &quot;bleeding heart&quot;, If these people are just saving their points for &quot;just one&quot; weapon, why does even matter? Like others have said, that ONE weapon wont reduce your crit against them like the gear does, it wont make them live longer. Also SO freaking what if he wants to save for ONE weapon?! Who says you have to buy the gear? Arena/PVE gives you the choice of what items you want, now you want to dictate in what order people should get items? Fall off your high horse i say. <br />

Again, who cares for the reason they want use the weapons THEY WANT for?! obviously, if they are not using them for PvP, then that 'scrub' shouldnt even bother you again, thus you can kill off another scrub, thats just one less scrub for you to worry about right?<br />

Again, fall off your high horse , who are you to determine what item someone wants to get first? Wouldnt it be so cool if I TOLD YOU what BT item you can get first? Want that Staff? Sorry, your saving your DKP for this belt instead, because i said so. Yeah you'd be raging pissed off at that, so why try to make someone else's decision for them??<br />
<br />
Ok, got that off my chest.<br />
<br />
I think i have a better idea than a ratings requirement, although it would contradict what i said<br />
<br />
<br />
Who says you have to buy the gear? <br />
<br />
i think, according to the above raging poster, he seems to be upset, along with others, that most 'scrubs' ONLY want to buy the weapons and NOT the gear. So, i think instead of a ratings requirement, maybe before you can buy a S3 Weapon, you first have to buy, hmmm..i don't know 2 pieces of S3 gear first, then be able to buy S3 Weapons. You wouldn't neccessarily have to WEAR the gear, ONLY buy it. <br />
<br />
I think in this way, the 'scrubs' would actually care which pieces of armor they want to get to their weapons. Just another idea, take it however you may</div></div><hr />

Say I QQ cause only 1 guild on my server is in BT and they don't need a shadow priest. I'm upset because i put in time to get gear, but i can't get to the prize. Now i want to use my gold to buy BT gear from some vendor. Yea, it might cost a lot of gold, and will take me time to save, but so what, i want to buy it, i deserve it don't I? I mean i pay my monthly fee just like everyone else?<br />
<br />
This is why you need to have restrictions on who can get this gear. You're arguing that anyone should be entitled to amazing gear because it's pvp, and well, who cares about pvp right, it's just a past time for raiding? why take it seriously? But if i bring up some scheme for me to purchase BT gear without actually stepping in there and earning it, everyone on the forum would laugh at me and say I'm an idiot.<br />
<br />
Where do you draw your distinctions sir. It seems to me you obviously think that pvp shouldn't be taken seriously, and the amazing gear, no matter how many pieces of it you can purchase, should be available to all who take the time to save up some points for it. Once again i will state, the Season 2 gear is amazing. S3 weapons should expect to be on par with the sword that drops of Archimonde for casters, and other top end raid bosses for melee classes. Is it really fair to the people who bust their ass to gear up, learn the content, and play well as a 25 man unit if i can mess around in 2v2 for 10 matches a week and save up points to get a weapon that's basically the same if not better than what they have? Now we're not only cheapening PvP, but we're cheapening PvE as well.<br />
<br />
Add the fact that the item level on S2 gear is higher than T5, and comparably for the weapons, it would stand to reason that S3 armor and weapons will have a slightly higher item level than T6 and it's comparable weapons. So once again, you're going to argue that not only should anyone be able to purchase stuff that is T6 quality, but possibly even better than T6. I can see outrage not only from the high end PvPers but the PvEers as well, and rightfully so.<br />
<br />
This is a game, yes. It's meant to be fun, yes. But no where in the user agreement did it say you are entitled to anything at all. Top end gear is made for top end players, it is not needed for lower end players, and it won't really help them catch up to top end content anyway, so all we're really arguing is desire. Everyone desires the best stuff, but you should have to face the same reality you do in PvE, which is, you're not gonna get it, so get used to the fact and focus on getting what you can.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And those people who saved their points didnt put time into? They are giving up S2 gear, for one weapon. Meanwhile they are constantly getting beat in arena. They too pay a monthly fee, dont they deserve it too? See how that works?<br />
<br />
<br />
Say I QQ cause only 1 guild on my server is in BT <br />
<br />
Some people can't even raid Kara, so they found the alternative which was BGs/Arena gear. I suggest that you either 1) do the same or 2) find a server that has more than 1 guild clearing BT<br />
<br />
<br />
But if i bring up some scheme for me to purchase BT gear without actually stepping in there and earning it, <br />
<br />
Its funny your bring this 'earning' thing up. Ok, yes when a guild as a whole first runs an instance, its a bitch and its a repair bill nightmare. Once that is done tho, the whole thing becomes a joke. Once the 'core' members get through the instance, they start bringing in people on the sidelines or their alts. Also, the 'core' members are awarded through their trial and error by having the gear: GASP FIRST AND FASTEST which brings me to the next point<br />
<br />
<br />

Now we're not only cheapening PvP, but we're cheapening PvE as well.<br />
<br />
The 'hardcore pvpers' are rewarded through their skill by having their gear FIRST AND FASTEST, which UNLIKE in PVE, PvP having better gear doesnt ONLY mean you get to be number one on the dps meters, it means you have an edge against a lower geared player. <br />
<br />
Thats pretty much the point in BOTH PvE and PvP. In PvE, guilds race through instances to gain what? Bragging rights to have beaten the instance *gasps* FIRST AND FASTEST, and once that happens whoever gets the instance done 2nd , or 3rd, it doesnt even matter. Its the same thing for the PvPers, they just want the gear FIRST AND FASTEST, the only thing with the hardcore pvpers, is that they THINK that a lesser rated person 'doesnt deserve' that gear, whereas in the PvE situation, if a lesser guild got a server first, they wouldnt be looked down upon, they would actually get praised by other guilds. Thats the KEY and ONLY difference is that the hardcore PvPers just want to be on their high horse and let NO ONE get gear, and that i dont agree with.<br />
<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mackabre</div><div class="date">2007-09-12, 06:33 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At first when I thought about the idea of buying the armor pieces first before you can buy the weapon, it doesn't sound that great. But if you think about it, it does solve a lot of the problems (besides the whole buying a team thing). The weapons are only the main concern with nearly all the top end Arena people and top end PvE guilds. The S2 weapon is on par with Hyjal/BT weapons. If it weren't for Maelstrom's Fury dropping for me, I would've bought S2 weapon a long time ago and not upgraded till possibly the Sunwell. <br />
I think we're missing the point in that Blizzard was right in putting a rating requirement or some sort of requirement for wearing the weapons (although blind to the fact that people buy out teams or sell teams), it was a step (in theory), in the right direction.<br />
<br />
Now, Keld, you're right. It is a pain on repairs,time, mental frustration, consumables to learn new content. And you're right that after you beat it all, it nearly becomes a lot easier than when learning. Hell we clear nearly all of BT in 4 hours now (darn Mother Shahraz fight), but doing it every week still requires focus and attention. I believe what Divert was getting at was that although on &quot;farm status&quot; the instance is still hard, whereas losing (even if not on purpose) in Arena to get your 10 games a week and still have something to show for it thats on par with Hyjal/BT does not seem fair.<br />
<br />
Yes we all pay our monthly subscription, nowhere does it say you are entitled loot or say you are not entitled loot. But you pay to play in the world of warcraft, you're not paying for content/loot. <br />
<br />
Lastly, I do think that beating an instance first is a good reward for pve just like you say getting an item first is its reward in pvp. But most players' pay off is the fact that they have gear to show from the instance that no one else has. That is to show their effort, time and success in the instance. PvP only awards two of those three things and its the wrong two.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yes, i agree with this statement but not totally. I agree on the point of having loot on par with BT/Hyjal. But, i m not sure where i read/heard this, but Blizzard said S3 wouldnt be on par with T6, so that solves that problem. Now the part where i dont agree on, is what then of the MILLIONS ( there are millions ) of people who can't/don't/w/e reason do Kara/BT/TK/SSC? You know what will happen if they can't gear that can't compete? That's right, we will have the old honor system all over again, in that do you remember when T2 people would just come in BGs and own? Thats what Blizzard was trying to fix with Arena, yet Blizzard is kinda in a conundrum.<br />
<br />
On one hand they need to try and please the PvE with great PvE gear, which they've done in spades. Now, though, PvE'ers are complaining that S2 Weaposn are better than the weapons in BT/Hyjal, and i agree, rightly so. But, again i'm not sure where i read/heard but Blizzard is ready to remedy that by having S3 &lt; T6. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, you have PvPers complaining that 'scrubs' are getting loot at all!, even though they already get the loot FIRST AND FASTEST and mop the floor with said 'scrubs'? That is already remedied in that Hardcore PvPers already get their loots again FIRST AND FASTEST. If blizzard applies a 'high' rating requirement, people will simply not play.<br />
<br />
NOTE: Actually it seems that the only complaint seems to be about the S2 weapons. If that is the case, i think the best solution , that satisfies both casual/pvpers/raiders/etc.. is make a purchase requirement like the one i suggested. That way those 'scrubs' &quot;take pvp more seriously&quot; as they have to dump 3750 Arena Points to get 2 pieces of S3 gear before they can buy the S3 weapons, thus they wont just 'care about the weapons'. BUT make it so you dont have to WEAR the gear if you so choose to, but that would make casuals&quot;take pvp more seriously&quot; as who is gonna NOT wear 2 pieces of gear that cost them 3750 points ( thats assuming the most expensive pieces at 1875, i know S3 will be more but that what i have to go by right now )<br />
<br />
I think overall that would be the best solution.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Sorry there buddy, but i do deserve the right to speak, to be heard tho ,is a different issue.<br />
<br />
I'm not the one who brought up the ToS, i merely was trying to point out what you did :<br />
<br />
<br />
@the other guy, don't ever bring the TOS into an argument, it gets you nowhere =p<br />
<br />
I dont even now why &quot;the other guy&quot; even brought the ToS up, but he is the one who said: <br />
<br />
<br />
But no where in the user agreement did it say you are entitled to anything at all<br />
<br />
All i did was reply in turn and you try to say i dont have the right to speak??<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The right to speak thing is because people who believe it doesn't say they can't do something, automatically assume that it means they are entitled to do it.<br />
<br />
Apologies if thats not what you meant, went a little harsh, probably carried over from a similar argument I had today with a random student who was arguing about &quot;The rules don't say I can't do it&quot; &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although, im loving this site more and more because i d say over 90% of the posts here are very constructive, and <br />

I appologize for the &quot;hight horse&quot; thing, i just frustrated with the &quot;hardcore&quot; (not neccessarily you ) trying to dictate what others can do, and i think i rubbed that frustration to you :) but its a good debate, we both have great points and bring the ideas/opinions :)</div></div><hr />

I do remember T1 and T2 people owning up BG's. That is also why they developed PvP stats like resilience on PvP items. As you can see, not a whole lot of PvE armor can help you as much as PvP armor. And yes I know there are literally millions of players that can't,don't do raids. But like I've said, we pay to play in WoW. Some people are more productive with their time than others, they should be rewarded because it is a game. Not saying that people who play casually shouldn't get rewards, but it doesn't seem fair that others who put in time, effort and succeed at what they do get the same rewards as people who don't. I don't mind the &quot;less successful&quot; players to get the armor, as the huge concern is with the weapons. When my guild has players only pvping to get the weapon to use in raids, that in itself is very wrong. They should make the PvP weapons more centered toward pvp and the pve weapons more centered toward pve. <br />

<br />
S3 should be &lt; than T6 FOR PvE'ers. When the weapons are better than Hyjal/BT, then we have a problem. The armor (based on the trend from S1 to S2) will never be better than PvE armor for PvE purposes. <br />
I've read through this thread a lot and I do agree that if they only implement a rating requirement, buying/selling teams will just increase and the other &quot;casual players&quot; will simply not play. It's a pretty cheap fix on Blizzards part, but at least they are thinking of something (although bad atm) to fix the current problems in arena.</div></div><hr />
