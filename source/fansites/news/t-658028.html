Curse of Weakness no longer stacks with Demoralizing Shout or Demoralizing Roar.<br />
The following Ulduar bosses have had their melee damage slightly reduced in both normal and heroic versions: Algalon, Thorim, General Vezax, and Steelbreaker.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Right because it matters so much that Ulduar bosses can be killed by facerolling when you got Coliseum to prove your mettle right?<br />
Should they buff Onyxia and Ragnaros so ppl can't faceroll them too?<br />

well in WoW history, the word &quot;slightly&quot; means &quot;a fair amount&quot; - I'm not complaing too much - Hopefully the nerfs will help me get my 25 man drake easier before 3.2</div></div><hr />

Yeah my server, Skullcrusher, has some really good raiding guilds - And I am not talking about WotLK raiding, I'm talking in TBC a handful of them cleared Sunwell before nerfs or the week after the first nerf... Out of those guilds only one been able to do Freya HM.<br />
<br />
It might be the first &quot;difficult fight&quot; of WotLK</div></div><hr />

<br />
The damage reduction to the aforementioned bosses is parallel to the damage reduction you would have recieved if you were stacking Curse of Weakness &amp; Demoralising Shout / Roar. They've effectively &quot;baked&quot; this into each boss so the &quot;stacking&quot; requirement isn't so heavy. (ie. Every ideal composition would regard these two debuffs/classes as mandatory)<br />
<br />
So what does this mean?<br />

If you weren't stacking Curse of Weakness &amp; Demoralising Shout before today, each encounter will now play out as though you were.<br />

what he said, so far the changes from normal and heroic i've noticed is 2 more big adds spawn each time he spawns them, scarabs zerg you more, and the spikes move faster, not much else i've noticed</div></div><hr />

So you could say that those mobs you've fought before perhaps are more awesome than they should? :) I really like the Nerubian models.<br />
<br />
On another note: This whole thing with the coliseum just feels like an elaborate intermission before we get to fight Arthas, which is pretty sad from a story-perspective. The fact that everything is being tested on PTR kind of removes any competition it could've had.</div></div><hr />

No more awesome than fighting a blue six-legged alligator at level 10 then fighting several other color variants of six-legged alligator over the next 70 levels. Re-used models are lame.. especially when blown up 10x (even looking distorted) larger and given a ton of HP and called a boss. Whats next? Are they going to take the same boars i've fought for ages and blow one up 20x larger and call it the new endgame?<br />
<br />
Besides i agree, nerubian models are nice, but they could have used a little more effort and created something a little new. CTRL-C &gt; CTRL-V &gt; Edit &gt; Size &gt; 10x = NEW BOSS!</div></div><hr />

I agree completely, every boss should be a unique model, especially raid bosses. I mean the could've at least given Anub'arak those big spikes on his back that he had in Warcraft 3: tft after you upgraded his abilities. In fact that should be part of the encounter, when he hit him you take some damage.</div></div><hr />

Curse of Weakness no longer stacks with Demoralizing Shout or Demoralizing Roar.<br />
The following Ulduar bosses have had their melee damage slightly reduced in both normal and heroic versions: Algalon, Thorim, General Vezax, and Steelbreaker.<br />
<br />
<br />
The nerf is to cover up for the loss of curse of weakness. You won't notice a difference if you're use to have a warlock with &quot;CoW&quot; on the boss.</div></div><hr />

Yep, Band of the Traitor King, with exactly the same stats. Seems a bit silly to me as well, but perhaps doing this was easier with the new faction loot system, rather than introducing one or more items which drop for each faction.</div></div><hr />
