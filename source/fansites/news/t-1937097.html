Somewhat concerned that you're hitting tank AM instead of healer passives like Beacon of Light.<br />
Passive healing is a huge contributor to the problem as well, and we plan to shift their healing to be more direct. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/687456629147615232))<br />
<br />
Can you clarify &quot;more survivability than a non-tank [...] don’t necessarily need to be [...] more sturdy.&quot;<br />
Currently tanks are up to 50x as sturdy as a non-tank. We don't think there needs to be that stark of a difference. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/687454551557840896))<br />
<br />
Was really hoping we'd move more towards mop style tanking, i.e. good tanks are self sufficient with passive heals<br />
That ends up taking gameplay away from healers. It’s possible to have good tanks be better, and for healers to &lt;1/2&gt; (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/687459063320285184))<br />
still have tank-healing gameplay. &lt;2/2&gt; (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/687459093200515072))<br />
<br />
the tank changes appear to make tanking more passive and more boring as a result. Disappointing<br />
Passive is definitely not the goal. We think that going from 90% to 60% AM uptime increases skill/impact of choices. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/687459279985479681))<br />
How does increased, focused &quot;tank healer&quot; dependency possibly jive with the new Disc PR spec, most notably in a 5-man PUG?<br />
Tried it? Have Shadow Mend and the new Mind Blast not handled tank healing well enough for you? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/687564903977218049))<br />
<br />
RE: Tank change post, please make sure AM tweaks are accounted for in old fights with mechs that ref AM directly<br />
We plan to! We welcome any bug reports and feedback on this. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/687459821616902144))<br />
<br />
it doesn't. it really really does not. it just makes clunky, slow combat. choice = having more abilities to choose from.<br />
We are definitely open to feedback on this! Make sure to read this post for more details: https://t.co/ICSdAkgtoJ (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/687461374201495553))<br />
<br />
Hey boss the colors on these https://t.co/STGjZQY33Q resemble mounts but I see no saddles. Are these tameable mechs by chance?<br />
Yep! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/687704566607945728))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Does the Artifact Talent to increase PW:Radiance's healing also apply to shadow covenant? (since it replaces PW:R)<br />
Yep! Talents that replace base spells receive the same bonuses from their respective Artifact Traits. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/687708421911527424))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What is the value in actively making something only 1% of your playerbase gets to enjoy? Also, more people own Thoridal and the Warglaives than Shadowmourne, Fangs, Valanyr or Dragonwrath. Can't just be age<br />
From a player point of view, there can be a lot of prestige in having something that few players get. You certainly used to see this with the original WoW legendary weapons when players would hang out in IF/Org just so other players could come fawn over them. I did it with my tier 2 tank armor and Quel'Serrar.<br />
<br />
To achieve that as a player, you have to a) be able to acquire something that b) other players can't easily (if ever) get. Having very low drop rates really hurts A because you can't just set your sights on a goal. The RNG will trump whatever commitment you throw at the game. It is however very good at B because it has the same effect on other players.<br />
<br />
Long time commitments delay acquisition, but they don't really keep the items rare. The Long Strange Trip Protodrake was &quot;hard&quot; to get in that you had to be very dedicated for a long period of time (and IIRC there was some luck thrown in there as well) but when they were first available, many players had them and more got them over time, and in fact, the existence of that mount pushed us to just make very fast mounts something everyone could acquire.<br />
<br />
As more and more players were able to achieve things that used to be rare, say a legendary or High Warlord's PvP gear, the bragging rights diminished. I worked on WoW for 6 years and played it for maybe 8 and even I couldn't tell you who were the elite raiders or gladiators in Mists just by seeing their armor.<br />
<br />
What I'm arguing is that maybe that's inevitable. Maybe the time of &quot;Check out that tauren's armor!&quot; passed. Maybe there isn't a way to keep rare things really rare in ways that don't feel shitty to players. However, *if* you decide as a developer that it's important to have rare rewards, I believe the only way to keep them rare is low drop rates. Making them require massive skill or time investment just aren't sufficient any longer.<br />

Well its either going to be for Mythic or for Elite PVP so choose your poison ;)<br />

<br />
It's all a bit silly really. The fact players seem to think that their normal mode Tier set, at this point in the patch, is somehow more impressive or more hard earned than a players LFR gear is pretty laughable. If anything, the LFR players clearly haven't even been trying to progress so they're not the ones that should be embarrassed. You think your special colours gives you more prestige? You might as well just wear a sign saying &quot;I've still not managed to get to Mythic yet.. &quot;.<br />
<br />
I remember the arguments about the &quot;wellfare&quot; legendaries of MOP. As someone who raided very hearily until MOP I can tell you that farming with a legitimate, competent raid team is about 100 times easier, stress free and an enjoyable experience than having had to do all that crap in continued LFR groups from hell.</div></div><hr />

I also heavily disagree on the part that says that skill is not a viable option to make things rare. There just needs to be skill based content that can be done solo, like a very difficult quest (think Black Harvest for Warlocks, just without nerfs or people outgearing it).</div></div><hr />

It's about appropriate rewards for the amount of effort you put into it. There is no point in doing anything if you get the same rewards for doing nothing. You can literally complete an entire wing of lfr just by having someone on follow and going to make a cheeseburger. You should not get any rewards for that. Imo they should remove gear from tourist mode since it only exists for people to see the story. If they want gear they should do normal. It's beyond easy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not a sense of entitlement at all actually. People have different reasons. Some people work jobs and can't put in 18 hours a day into WoW like mythic players can. I don't mean 18 physical hours, but i know the amount of theorycrafting, studying and practice that goes into attempts before someone even gets a kill. In my case, Legion is the first time ive wanted to play literally every spec in the game. I want to main my feral druid and progress. When it comes to my alts, i want to be able to not look like shit in the lfr gear. <br />
<br />
Is being a special snowflake bad? Nah; be proud of your Iron Reaver mount, or my moose mount which im equally as happy with. The point is, everyone deserves to find a sense of fulfillment in the game, because that's what continues subs, not the elitists of the game like you who complain about &quot;lfr being cancer&quot; and very obviously don't see the bigger picture, or know how a business works. I'll say it again, the game is for the public. Not for the high-end raiders who think they're better than the rest of the population.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's exactly what I am doing since BC, because even while raiding in BC and Wrath I was not able to complete my sets (low pop pvp server with many people for whom attendance was not that important). <br />
<br />
But where is the problem in having several variants of the sets, with Mythic being the most opulent one and LFR having the basics? I loved how they started with a basic PvP set in Wrath and expanded on the concept over the course of the seasons in the expansion, so the last set was the best looking in terms of detail. <br />
<br />
You get the basic look from participating in the content, as a reward for &quot;being there&quot; and doing the associated quests / killing the bosses on the lowest difficulty, and elaborate versions for higher difficulty. This is called a win-win situation. It is usually the thing which people strive to achieve, so everyone is happy. Nobody wants to take away your shinies. On top, you already get the best gear in game by beating mythic. Why behaving like a sore loser while you are not one?<br />

<br />
It's about appropriate rewards for the amount of effort you put into it. There is no point in doing anything if you get the same rewards for doing nothing. You can literally complete an entire wing of lfr just by having someone on follow and going to make a cheeseburger. You should not get any rewards for that. Imo they should remove gear from tourist mode since it only exists for people to see the story. If they want gear they should do normal. It's beyond easy.<br />
<br />
Of course the gameplay is easy. What you all seem to forget is the fact that the community is toxic elitist, hiding opportunities behind walls of gearscore. Finding PUGs was much easier in Wrath, for example, as it is now. Now add in log-in time which does not correspond with the majority, and you will get even less opportunities.</div></div><hr />

PVP (Elite) (WITH GLOW)<br />
<br />
PVE Normal<br />
PVE Heroic<br />
PVE Mythic (WITH GLOW)<br />
<br />
That does not make much sense. LFR set is more likely tbh. Because why not give elite pvp two colors too?</div></div><hr />

Let's hope LFR keeps getting generic gear and not tier, at least that is my hope LFR is a sight seeing tour that doesn't deserve tier.</div></div><hr />

as someone who hardly has time to play anymore - i agree. things stop being interesting when they become ubiquitous. I enjoyed seeing people in dalaran with warglaives because it was so rare to see them. i didn't get angry that I didn't have them. why should i? why should anyone? <br />
<br />
its like single player games that reveal more of the story the harder the game settings are. games are meant to be entertaining - but a lot of people (casuals like myself included) understand that entertainment can mean challenge. trivial tasks in game = trivial rewards. epic tasks = epic rewards. I have no problem with that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">splatomat</div><div class="date">2016-01-20, 07:24 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I think tier gear should only have a 1% drop rate off mythic bosses only. Kill a mythic boss, it has a 1% chance to drop one tier set item from one random class. Might not even be for a class in your raid. If it's not rare its not cool, right? Gotta work for it, scrubs! Get off your lazy asses and start grinding dem bosses! Only 2 people on the server should have finished their sets by the time the expansion is over! If a third person finishes, well, that set is not cool or interesting anymore. EPIC!</div></div><hr />

Challenge is only a challenge if you achieve it with the same means available for everyone. In sports, &quot;gear&quot; matters to some degree, but is also strongly regulated. I would like less gear bloat, more availability of this gear to everyone, and challenges in higher difficulties, that don't come from huger numbers, but from more demanding gameplay. Like bosses having more mechanics.<br />
<br />
And then, add unique titles, vanity items and special character frames to the people who need to boast their egos - that they could beat a higher difficulty with the same gear. There is no competition in a race where one person is running and the other is using a bike!</div></div><hr />
