Patch 6.2 Zone Preview: Tanaan Jungle<br />
Blizzard posted a preview of Tanaan Jungle tonight, a zone somewhat similar to an improved version of Timeless isle.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;900&quot; height=&quot;506&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/2aFGyx0_AWI?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Deep within Tanaan Jungle, the manipulations of the warlock Gul’dan have twisted what remains of the Iron Horde into a sinister new form—an army of fel orcs brimming with demonic strength and insatiable bloodlust. Now Gul’dan continues his machinations from inside the seemingly impenetrable Hellfire Citadel, plotting to open a portal for a massive invasion force.<br />
In Patch 6.2, level 100 heroes of the Horde and the Alliance must return to Tanaan Jungle and stop Gul’dan before his dark plans bring about untold ruin. As part of your quest, you’ll explore Draenor’s darkest corners, confront twisted new foes, and face a new series of chapter-based quests that will put everything you’ve learned on Draenor to the test. <br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Getting to Tanaan Jungle<br />
One does not merely stroll into Tanaan Jungle—there are preparations to be made, including establishing a Shipyard for your Garrison in a bid to take on this new threat from two directions: both land and sea. You'll progress through a series of quests in which you'll be asked to build a Shipyard, begin an assault on Tanaan by sea, and set up a new forward base hub—Vol’mar for the Horde and Lion’s Watch for the Alliance. Completing missions will provide materials for your Shipyard, supporting your ongoing efforts to control the seas of Draenor.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The Story Continues<br />
Much like the previous Garrison Campaign chapter-based quests, a new series of random quests will take players through the developing story and further into the jungles of Tanaan, including key locations such as the cave in which Kilrogg sacrificed his eye. Over the course of your journey, you’ll learn that Gul'dan and his fanatical allies have even more sinister plans up their sleeves. <br />
<br />

<br />
Objective Hubs<br />
Once your new outpost is established, you'll go on the offensive and choose one of two hot spots each day to assault. Your goal is to undermine Gul'dan's plan to drag the whole of Draenor into chaos. There are seven new areas to explore, including:<br />
<br />
Ironhold Harbor: Stop the Iron Horde's reinforcements from making landfall.<br />
Ruins of Kra'nak: Stop Gul'dan's Shadow Council from recruiting the arakkoa.<br />
Temple of Sha'naar: Defeat demon-summoning Sargerei in this ruined temple.<br />
The Felforge: You'll need to throw a monkey wrench into the manufacturing of fel machinery.<br />
The Iron Front: Hold the line in this massive battlefield to the west.<br />
Throne of Kil’jaeden: You and your party will face elite creatures and attempt to stem the demonic tide.<br />
Zeth’gol: Take your assault into the capital of the Bleeding Hollow.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
More to Explore and Discover<br />
There will be even more to discover as you make your way through the ongoing battle for Tanaan. Safety is an illusion, and the jungle houses more than just Gul’dan’s new Horde. The warlock's influence has had a corrupting effect on the land, and the fel water that flows here taints everything it touches.<br />
<br />

<br />
You'll also discover more minor quest hubs and a variety of wildlife, along with dozens of new treasures and Rare creatures just waiting for unwary travelers to stumble upon. The path through this treacherous place is yours to forge.<br />

Q: Tanaan Intro, at the very end, now drops a trinket that is AWESOME for levels 90-100 (up to H dungeon). Would you do Tanaan or skip it? Y (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/591493508231352320))<br />

Did you boost a character to 90 and dive right in to Warlords of Draenor? Would love to hear your feedback for the boost experience! (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/591500260087705600))<br />
<br />
So what do you DISLIKE about the Tanaan intro? Be honest, we can take it. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/591496639950393344))<br />
The arena mostly because it doesn't feel like there's a real threat going on, which I know is really vague feedback, sorry<br />
It's not! All feedback is awesome, and the feeling you got from this is important. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/591498781838811137))<br />
I did it six times and I... enjoyed it all six times. I'm probably not the person you need feedback from <br />
What did you LIKE about it? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/591497217174675456))<br />
<br />
World<br />
Tanaan jungle, is there going to be anything similar to bloody coins on timeless isle?<br />
No current plans, though you can continue to collect bones for your sparring arena. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/591397870147801088))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
Any chance for more music to garrison juke box in 6.2? Would love to hear the ICC Gunship battle music &lt;3.<br />
No plans for this right now, but we were super happy to see how much people liked the feature and we april revisit it in the future. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/591399062869413889))<br />

Everyone's &lt;span title=&quot;or least favorite&quot;&gt;favorite bird&lt;/span&gt; got some new costumes and an achievement to go with them (I Found Pepe! (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/10053-i-found-pepe)) in the latest Patch 6.2 PTR build. The source of the costumes is not yet known.<br />
<br />
So far, 0.41% of players have the What A Strange, Interdimensional Trip It's Been (http://ptr.wowdb.com/achievements/9838-what-a-strange-interdimensional-trip-its-been) achievement.<br />

Speak for yourself, buddy. Timeless Isle is one of my favourite things ever added to WoW. I loved everything about it and went there every day, long after the gear had lost any value, just to hunt rares, grind some coins and enjoy the atmosphere.</div></div><hr />

No they didn't. Some did, some didn't. Don't make sweeping generalisations.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard: PLAYERS HATED TIMELESS ISLE!!!!<br />
<br />
There is nothing in this game that (some) players haven't hated.<br />
<br />
Personally, I really enjoyed Timeless Isle, I just wish it had more variety. Things that would maybe change up every week.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard: PLAYERS HATED TIMELESS ISLE!!!!<br />
<br />
I liked timeless isle. It was different to anything they had done before, it felt really dynamic and not so static like other quest/daily hubs. A big problem in WoD - for me everything feels like its static, like a dead world.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phaidrae</div><div class="date">2015-05-01, 10:12 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im super stoked about something like the timeless isle coming back to the game. I REALLY had a lot of fun out there...and it's a relief that they actually seemed to listen to the players for once and they ARE NOT bringing those awful censers back.<br />
<br />
I'm looking forward to this. Perhaps it'll renew my interest. First time ever since I started playing that I barely ever feel like playing. Dungeons are awful and uninteresting. I spend like an hour messing around between all my toons' garrisons and then just log. I've barely even touched the raids to work on my legendary.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Atmosphere has nothing to do with the overall design which was slow and boring, and was a gate to slow people down. What made people like the island was the world boss's.<br />
<br />
But blizzard don't want world boss's to be useful any more so good luck with finding anything out in timeless island 2.0, other then more pets and mounts...</div></div><hr />

We've already seen hats like that in game. The only thing that doesn't tie into the WoW universe is the naming, perhaps. But we've seen horned helmets in the vykrul, we've seen the term ninja used in relation to savory deviate delights and the booty bay pirates are very much stereotypical pirates. <br />

Well like everything else not everyone hated it, there were people over there everyday grinding out endless rep and farming for a mount. The content itself was useful for probably a day. Tanaan is just more to the same, only this time they masked the Island, in this case zone in a cool wrapping to mask the true lack of content.<br />
<br />
This expansion came down to 4 things. People that enjoy raiding, battles pets, grindy meaningless content at level cap, and those that absolutely enjoy the whole Timeless Isle concept. If one enjoyed all those things, then this expansion was right for you, if not hope they change course in the next expansion. This one is in the books for you, because if they create more content past 6.2, it will be just more of the same.<br />

<br />
I to have only been doing the mission twice a day and the various profession cd's. The rest of the time I am also in older content, not to fly mind you, because I just find the whole Timeless Isle way they chose to make every zone in Draenor feel like. I would rather redo older content that I have done a thousand times over, than bother with WoD content. I have no plans to go to Tanaan, its just more of the same wrapped in a cooling looking zone to mask the lack of real content that at least gives the appearance of being less grindy and not more. Tanaan will really be not different, then any of the other zones.</div></div><hr />

I finished every single bit of Wrath content long long long long long LONG ago, and Pandaria I really only have a few timeless isle achievements left to get, which means no flying anyway. Not sure what I could possibly do in any flight zone that I haven't already done at least once, and possibly many times over. Log in 2-3 times a day on each alt for 2-3 minutes to send out missions then I'm back to doing whatever the hell I want in Draenor. But I'm glad that you're having fun doing content that everyone else completed years ago. :D</div></div><hr />

They simply deemed it a success because it was used as a catch up mechanic for the people returning to the game and for those that simply chose to sit in Org, SW, and the shrines the whole expansion. It really offered little, but it forced people to go over there to grind endless rep and coins for a mount and to farm so called &quot;rares&quot; for trinkets, toys, upgrade tokens, and more armor tokens. Once you got all that done, you were pretty much done with whole thing. I could only ever stomach to go over there once a week to try to get a piece of gear from Ordos. This whole expansion has been basis on a tiny catch up island of the coast of the Jade Forest. <br />
<br />
If this is all they are capable of doing for world content, then they are really showing the desire to lesson the amount of people that truly are going to play it, sadly even flying at this point would not really make it all that more tolerable. If you have not bothered to explore by now, than flying would give you a bit more of a perspective of the landscape, but it would not play any different then it currently does.</div></div><hr />

I'm older, now, and don't have the time to sink into WoW that I once did. I look at Timeless Isle and it was an interesting &quot;funpark&quot; of timesink content. Was it good content? I don't really know. I don't like dailies, but I dislike relatively story-less timesinks.<br />
<br />
I'm just going to admit this. I don't even know what content is best anymore. I game for different reasons than I used to. I'm on mostly to socialize and raid with my team. I kinda wish I could just pick up entry-level raid gear on hitting 100, earn the upgrades through raiding, and not worry about the rest anymore. Get the story/open world through leveling. Idk.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. I have every achievement for it besides...like one of the PvP ones. Lot of good memories with friends there. Tanaan looks like it will be way more engaging than all of the older post-launch zones that basically just funneled you through quest lines and that was it.<br />
<br />
It's just funny. People just love to hate. So many people hated Cata's structure, so they added a bunch of big daily quest hubs in addition to more content than ever seen before in an expansion in MoP. Besides the &quot;wah, wah, I don't have dungeons to do that realistically I'll run a few times and then get bored of them and only run them to go through the motions.&quot; Because that's what happens every time. Happened in WotLK with it's tons of dungeons and people complained about that then.<br />
<br />
Then people hated MoP's hubs, so they created the Isle of Thunder with a mixture of one daily hub, rare spawns, exploration, and tons of other stuff (including the usual world boss and one of my favorite raids ever).<br />
<br />
People decided that wasn't good enough, there was too much structure, so they made the Timeless Isle, which has meaningful story elements with huge implications that were heatedly discussed for months (if you played it alongside the legendary quest line), and one weekly and one daily quest because everyone wined about those, with the rest of it being based on exploration to find pets, achievements, and rep grinding like in all the old content that everyone and their brother's uncle hailed as the &quot;golden age,' but for some reason the exact same mechanic put in a different expansion means that it's garbage.<br />
<br />
The fact is that whether you like every single thing in a given content launch, that doesn't mean no one else does. We still have superb content, even though I can already see people quoting this and saying that our raids are shit now compared to the &quot;golden age&quot; where there were hardly any boss mechanics--wiping was essentially predicated on one clunky mechanic and shitty skill design. Get over it. You were 10. I still think tons of games I played back then were better than anything today, but objectively looking at them, it doesn't mean that I'm right.<br />
<br />
Before MoP, your content was basically raiding, questing (which most people try to skip after the first go through), and rep grinding. We have all of that and more. All of it. And the older features have been tuned to be more challenging and interesting than ever before. This is only partly opinion. It's an objective fact that bosses do more than they ever have, that encounters are more involved than they ever were. It's an objective fact that we have more to do than quest in every zone than ever before.<br />
<br />
I really hate coming on to MMO-C, anymore--I just come for the news. Everyone loves to hate. Enjoy the stuff that's out there. It's fun. Trust me. You're all turning into those old, grouchy people we told ourselves we never wanted to be when we were kids. You hate stuff because it's new and different. Grow up. Or grown down. Maybe we really need to grow down.</div></div><hr />

Post of the year. There is plenty of depth in the questing content/storytelling. The better play modes are all represented and the dungeon/raid mechanics are as good or better than they've ever been. I might have enjoyed better faction rewards in WoD, but they would just be more mandatory grindy if they did offer more high value rewards. Fair trade off.</div></div><hr />

You whine and complain about a lack of outdoor content (Which, honestly...who cares about outdoor content? You don't. You log in to raid and like it, and come here to bitch for no reason) and when they finally give it to you...some of you are like &quot;LOL STILL NO CONTENT&quot; acting like it doesn't exist or something? When you're done acting like morons on the internet all day, what do you do with your lives?</div></div><hr />

To the person you quoted: So you think a simple hat and maybe a weapon as an entire tier set is an improvement? I would have to disagree. Yeesh, was just reading some other comments around here, I forgot how mind numbingly nitpicky, whiny, opinionated, and just plain negative it is on MMO-Champion.<br />

To you: No realistic/more medieval-based helmets? <br />

There are plenty of medieval-esque helmets, or just helmets based on those seen throughout history in real life. The problem is that this is primarily a fantasy game, and if they were to base everyone on real life, it would become boring and unimaginitive. People think their armor is so &quot;weird&quot; because it's typically based off of aspects of the patch or expansion they are found in, or elements of the class they are based on, or a combination of the two.<br />
<br />
Realistic armor is better off as quest gear, because while the simplicity of the aesthetic looks good for a nice and simple t-mog, it still feels just as you described it - &quot;normal&quot;. Simple knight helmets wouldn't feel epic, or deserving of a raid or pvp tier. It would feel like you're a low level character again due to how basic and unremarkable it is. Even when Blizzard does make armor based off of history, they still add a fantasy twist to it to keep it interesting, and that's something I like (and it says a lot about the appeal of realistic-based armor in a highly fantasy-based game.) I say keep the ultra-realistic armor for games like Dark Souls which are supposed to be a lot more grounded in the actual medieval age than WoW.</div></div><hr />

Half those sets are mail/eather, BTW, not plate. Yes that's right the one perfect samurai helmet in the game is only for leather classes. And that heaume from PvP has weird bone spikes in it, much like the Warrior and DK sets have ridiculous wiggling nails. Why couldn't they have just been rivets.</div></div><hr />
