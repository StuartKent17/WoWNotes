PvP Disqualification Policy Update<br />
As part of our continued efforts to combat cheating and unfair play in World of Warcraft, we’ve recently made a change to our policies regarding PvP disqualifications.<br />
<br />
As of the Battle for Azeroth Pre-Patch, any player who is found to have engaged in unfair practices that result in their disqualification from end-of-season PvP rewards will also have their ability to queue for rated PvP matches immediately revoked. This restriction will continue through the remainder of the season in which they were disqualified, which includes the current “Post-Season” available until Battle for Azeroth launches.<br />
<br />
This change is intended to minimize the impact that disqualified players have on those who are playing legitimately while the PvP season continues, and is just one aspect of our ongoing commitment to upholding the competitive integrity of World of Warcraft PvP.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gliders, this is basically making your latency spike making melle unable to hit you. <br />
<br />
Kickbots, Basically this is a hack that interrupts for you at such a rate fakecasting is impossible.<br />
<br />
Map hacks such as putting themselves into un-hittable areas.<br />
<br />
Just a few i have seen used.</div></div><hr />

<br />

Well it's a better way to stop a cheater that cares about their account, if he gets a new account he has 0 reason to not cheat and try to catch up.<br />
If he gets banned again he probably stops or repeats, but if he gets his account back after 3/4 months he might think twice about cheating on his account again. Of course there will be people that only cheat on a alt or whatever but you won't stop those guys anyway. <br />
Now you atleast stop some people.<br />
<br />
And it might just be about people that get boosted, you can buy boosts atm so it's kinda weird to ban people for that. I never read all those policies though so this could be wrong.</div></div><hr />

I think you missunderstood completly whats happening here,they are not stoping from baning people who use cheats like hacks or whatever,but in the situation where disqualification was the punishment,stuff like carries and wintrades,they are adding on top of that a ban from queing in rated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
closer to 95%, if not higher, but would it matter if they raised it to 5 mill, or gold cap?</div></div><hr />

<br />
First they have to investigate if it's a disqualification or not. Which usually takes to the and of the season anyways if anything happens at all that is.<br />
<br />
This is just words to fool people into thinking they care about you. Don't be fooled:)</div></div><hr />

Did you remember to put all your heirlooms on as well as warmode? they add an extra 60% xp, I was able to go up 7 levels in just under an hour.<br />

The backpedal on that was amusing. I figured it was a bug, until I saw this front page thing; then saw the other tweet that said it was intentional ... <br />
<br />
It is like there are two separate teams in Blizz and they hate each other. So every xpac, the team that hates fun ruins everything that makes things fun and accessible, unless people speak out in big enough numbers with a WTF really Blizz? like this.<br />
<br />
I stopped using the app until it was fixed; I'd check to see if it was 'Log Out' or not. There was no way in hell almost anyone would bother with a full log out to check more than the 3 most recently checked characters.<br />
<br />
Now, since they are going to integrate WoWArmory stuff; they are going to have to end that 'can't be logged into the app' at the same time BS as well; or the armory part will need to have a non-signed in to the f'n game mode. I didn't use the remote AH enough to recall if you could access that while online, but I assume you couldn't, and I am not completely sure why you couldn't manage your table while logged in other than abuse (but how could you exploit the tables) or account flagging for dual login (but they should have a check to see it is your common used device).</div></div><hr />

<br />
What Blizzard is saying here, is that you can cheat as a PvP-player, and continue playing the game normally - and nobody will ever have to know you are a cheater.<br />
<br />
But, if you cheat in PvE - your account is banned, probably permanent.</div></div><hr />

To be slightly fair, it was really hard at the beginning of Legion too. It was only gear from Legion that enabled most specs to beat it consistently.</div></div><hr />

I've been leveling up some allied races and have gained 11 levels in alliance zones I've never played through before while taking it slow and reading the quest text in just over 3.<br />

Wah? Just cleared mythic on a shitty warrior alt and it was complete faceroll, never dropped below 95% health and things died quickly enough, though obviously nowhere near as fast as before.<br />

I'm not bad at the game. Leveling through BC zones is slow as fuck. The game literally grinds to a halt when you hit 60.</div></div><hr />

This left-wing PvP style isn't interesting. Gear should give you an advantage, to make the playing field unequal. MMO PvP is only partly about skill, it's mostly about being better equipped than someone else. If we wanted to play chess, we would play it.</div></div><hr />

No it isn't? Kill adds, go up tower, shoot her down, kill.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The only hard part of the Galakras encounter is killing the adds that charge the boss NPCs and the one killing the goblins/gnomes. As long as you focus the right targets, the fight is a walk in the park. Yes, it's longer than before, but not impossible.</div></div><hr />
