<meta name="description" content="Mists of Pandaria - Beta Build 15657 
A minor build will be deployed on beta realms shortly, it seems to have mostly spell changes and a lot of model bugfixes but we'll keep digging! I also assume that this build is here to unlock the level cap and open the Shado-pan Monastery and Mogu'shan Palace to players.  
 
New Items 
Nothing really interesting, some Glyph items have also been added and probably means that some of the new glyphs are now craftable, or will be soon.

No, it was not OP, and never has been since implemented into the game. It is the only defense against a caster, set aside Gag Order. Doesn't help that it still requires shields.</div></div><hr />

I think I know why this is happening. I had a lowbie I made a miner/herbalist and was out wandering around and started mining. I was able to do so, even though I forgot to buy a Mining Pick! I think an undocumented change is that picks, knives, etc are no longer needed, just the skill. So instead all such items give a bonus of some sort to the skill. Would explain why one of my toons had a +1 to a skill that I was wondering where it came from.</div></div><hr />

Agreed, the funny thing is the only reason it got nerfed was due to pairing Prot Warriors with a Resto Shaman in RBGs loling with Grounding/Spell Reflect(In early Cata). Like others have said it's amusing how Spell Reflect needs to nerfed whereas Anti-Magic Shield is &quot;perfectly&quot; fine.</div></div><hr />

Are you comparing a once 10sec CD spell (now 30sec) with a 2min CD spell? Is that what you're saying? I guess you're right. Anti magic shell should have a 30sec cooldown!</div></div><hr />

AMS is a 45 second cooldown and makes you essentially immune to magic damage/debuff including magic type cc for 5 seconds....sr reflects one spell, has almost the same cooldown, can't be used effectively as dps in pvp, doesn't mitigate anything from raid bosses for pve, and correct me if I'm wrong but ams even makes you immune to ground effect slows. They may as well delete spell reflect.</div></div><hr />

Don't compare classes as it's useless.<br />
<br />
They added 5 seconds to this and pummel, making warriors more susceptible than they currently are to casters. I feel like the class is drifting towards where enhance is, aka revolving on being awesome for 20 seconds every 3 minutes (see Avatar).<br />
<br />
They also have nerfed the bleed durations, not to mention cutting out rend entirely. This makes warriors more susceptible to stealthies. <br />
<br />
Compile these nerfs with the fact that if you miss a mortal strike you are crippling your entire rotation and do the math on where you think warriors are going to be on the totem pole this coming expansion. <br />
<br />

Least you get some fun &amp; utility stuff which other professions don't get. <br />
<br />
You're using that army knife for about 2 expansions now and its still useful, aside of some enchants for alts, no other prof has items that are valid for more then 15 days after they get introduced to the game, except as said, engineering. <br />

I'm rather sad, actually. Sure it's more convenient to not have to remember to buy reagents, but that results in even less immersion than there is now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why remove gold sink even if it is very small one. We need more of them not less!<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
For the sake of convenience to many little gold sinks were (and still are) removed from the game. <br />

<br />
Those huge money sinks are only available to those who have excess of gold anyway.</div></div><hr />

Relying on things added to the game in previous expansions to make a profession viable sadly do not really help make the profession fun or interesting. Now, we could go into a whole &quot;what is the spirit of the profession&quot; debate, but I think I'll explore it from a slightly less subjective standpoint. With every new raiding patch, blacksmiths, tailors, and so on get multiple items to craft and sell. Engineers, at best, get new ranged weapons to make (which come MoP will only be usable by a single class, as you'll recall) and maybe a scope, both of which have material costs that usually exceed their AH price, as I stated. You may say &quot;well, crafting and selling aren't really what engineering is for. It's supposed to be about fun items!&quot; And yet I cannot help but notice that, with every new raid patch, Engineers don't usually get many &quot;fun items&quot; to add to their list. When they do, they're either severely limited by restrictions, have a more than negligible chance to leave you horribly maimed, or both.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On the one hand I find it odd that they give these to JC since they are one of the few professions that has a viable market throughout and expansion. I think LW needs the most help in that regards.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, I don´t think these things are going to be hugely profitable for JCs. You will probably have to buy some very expensive parts, build it, then hope it sells on the AH. You will have a big chunk of your gold tied up in an item sitting on the AH. Probably will not take very long at all until they are selling for only a little more than the cost of the expensive part. And wow, you want to be the one who builds the grand-daddy one? that is a huge chunk of your gold that will be sitting on the AH being undercut.</div></div><hr />

It's not like you will ever have close to 15 anyway. I don't think I have seen 5 at a time with my shadow.<br />
<br />
The shadow overhaul is making me sick. This is now the 4th or 5th reincarnation of the shadow...it always plays completely different and you never now what you will be next...pvp-god, running-mana-pool, 2nd-grade-healer, aoe-damage-dealer, single-target-damage-dealer, 1st-pvp-target...or whatever. If you like(or at least get used to) one reincarnation you can be sure it's gone with the next addon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think you're alone on that opinion... Shadowy Apparitions doesn't work as a core orb dump spell because it was boring and slow moving.</div></div><hr />
