Legion - Order Hall Upgrades<br />
In Legion, your Order Hall has a selection of upgrades you can unlock that help you and your followers. <br />
<br />
<br />
There are 6 tiers of upgrades, with 2 choices for each tier. <br />
 Each tier must be unlocked before you can access the next one.<br />
Switching choices requires the full time and cost that the initial research did. <br />
Currently each class has access to a different set of upgrades, but many of the effects are the same. <br />
All classes have an identical effect for their final tier, granting them the ability to equip another one of the legendary items coming in Legion (http://beta.wowdb.com/items?filter-expansion=7&amp;filter-quality=32). <br />

<br />
<br />
Artifact Knowledge<br />
Max-level players in this build may notice an important new Artifact feature. The researcher/scribe NPC in your Class Hall will offer you a quest to retrieve a set of tomes from around the world. Once these are recovered, you can instruct your researcher to work on deciphering these tomes. Each step of research will require some Order Resources (which are primarily obtained through World Quests), and will grant increased &quot;Artifact Knowledge.&quot;<br />
<br />
Increasing Artifact Knowledge permanently increases your rate of Artifact Power gains, and this bonus applies to all artifact weapons your character may possess. (And no, Artifact Power items obtained at a lower Knowledge level won't automatically update, so hoarding items for future use won't benefit you.) This system is key to the pacing of overall artifact progression, and to making it easier for players to maintain multiple artifacts if they so desire. For example, at Knowledge Level 7, you would be earning Artifact Power at over triple the base rate. Thus, if you wanted to switch to a spec you hadn't yet tried at that point, you'd find yourself very quickly able to get that artifact up to par with your primary one.<br />
<br />
As your scribes progress through their translation and research, you will fill in pages of a great tome in your Class Hall that provides more backstory and information about your artifact (this is not yet fully hooked up for some classes). Finally, in the live game, the speed at which your researchers can work will increase as the expansion progresses, allowing latecomers or alts to catch up on their artifact progress.<br />
<br />
The tuning of the experience and Knowledge curves is still in flux.<br />
<br />
Does this apply to leveling quest artifact power gains as well as those, atm, give by far best artifact power gains. Right now I see myself avoiding every quest that gives AP tokens until like 2-3 weeks in and getting a massive amount of AP.<br />
A number of non-repeatable sources of power will not be affected by Knowledge for this exact reason - notably level-up quests and treasures. The goal here is a system where the right way to play is to just... do stuff that you enjoy, accruing Artifact Power along the way. <br />
<br />

Raid Testing Schedule - April 25-26<br />
On Monday, April 25, and Tuesday, April 26, we will continue our Legion Alpha raid testing.<br />
<br />
Remember that Heroic difficulty scales for any group size between 10 and 30 players, so feel free to assemble and bring a group of any size within that range. Mythic, of course, requires 20 and does not scale.<br />
<br />
Monday, April 25<br />
<br />
Star Augur Etraeus - Heroic Nighthold<br />
13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
Krosus - Heroic Nighthold<br />
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 00:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
Tuesday, April 26<br />
<br />
Xavius - Heroic Emerald Nightmare<br />
13:30 PDT (16:30 EDT, 22:30 CEST)<br />
<br />
Skorpyron - Mythic Nighthold<br />
15:00 PDT (18:00 EDT, 00:00 CEST)<br />
<br />
As always, this testing schedule is very fluid and subject to the realities of an alpha environment. We might have to change the time of a testing session, change the boss being tested, or cancel a test entirely, due to bugs, server hardware issues, etc. Keep an eye on this forum for the latest information, and thank you in advance for testing and providing feedback.<br />

Theorycrafting Questions<br />
Please use this thread to ask questions related to how things work, mechanically (ie, for your theorycrafting projects). We sometimes leave out information that would be important to your modeling, in order to keep things understandable. We'd be happy to clarify any such things, here. Post your questions and we'll do our best to find answers.<br />
<br />
Example of the sort of question : What's the proc rate for Agony granting Soul Shards?<br />
<br />
This thread is NOT for feedback, discussion of 'why' something is the way it is, what a better mechanic would be, etc. Those topics are great to discuss, and we want to read that feedback, but please post it in different threads. We'll be aggressively pruning this thread as needed to keep it on topic.<br />
<br />
There are lots of theorycrafting related replies in this thread. Please see the blue tracker for all the posts. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409203-theorycrafting-questions/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743504316))<br />
<br />
Secondary Stat Scaling in Legion<br />
That is why we reduced the conversions in this build, as people discovered above. We are going to continue keeping an eye on it, but to answer your question--yes, you will get closer to the &quot;final&quot; values, earlier on, this time. The further gain from increasing ilvls will be much less drastic than in the past. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/403410-secondary-stat-scaling-in-legion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20742704730?page=4#72))<br />
<br />
Feedback Request - Tapping Rules<br />
Because ordinary quests (including dailies, and also you can include here any other types of quests like world quests) cannot be progressed in raid.<br />
How would you feel if you were treated like an ungrouped player when you were in a raid?<br />
<br />
When on a quest that requires a unique quest item from a named mob, (Head of XY, Big Slab of Bacon, ...), it occurs very often that the NPC will drop only one of that item.<br />
Amount of people was usually between 2 and 4. So we had to kill him twice or more for everyone to obtain the loot. Being grouped or not does not matter here (we tried both).<br />
This is a bug with the item being collected, please submit a report on the specific item.<br />
<br />
Is the tapping system supposed to work with old world content too or just the new Legion areas?<br />
All outdoor areas. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/408942-feedback-request-tapping-rules/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743434203?page=4#66))<br />

<br />
New Character Pane Stats Window<br />
And in the end, if they provide an &quot;advanced view&quot; with everything, at least it is there as an option.<br />
We're not planning to offer alternative views, but all of the information in the old character sheet will be available in the API.<br />
<br />
Tertiary stats will appear on the sheet if you have them on your items. We're also adding a teeny bit more information about the contribution from weapons.

Beast Mastery Hunter Feedback -- Build 21531 -- 21-Apr<br />
Also if somebody calls for a &quot;Stop DPS&quot; a BM Hunter has to unequip their weapon or dismiss their pet in order to even attempt to stop Hati from doing anything which is absolutely rediculous.<br />
I'm unsure if the change made it into this build or not, but Hati will respect the normal pet commands you issue and go passive when you want your pet to stop attacking.<br />
<br />
The 2 minute debuff is almost entirely there for PvP reasons and should have almost no effect in PvE. I do relaize Hati's health is currently abnormally low, it will be fixed to be higher than what it currently is.

Mistweaver Monk Feedback -- Build 21531 -- 21-Apr<br />
It wouldn't be surprising if the mastery has to come down a little, in terms of coefficient, after the EF change (what you'd expect for effectively increasing the number of spells affected by a mastery). It would also rein in the mastery benefit to Effuse somewhat. It's not bad at all if the new mechanic introduces some more varied use cases for Effuse, but its tuning implications for will be a little clearer after seeing it in action more. Essence Font enabling those options is fine, but it's important that mana is an important limitation on its uptime.<br />
<br />
Effuse cost is already changed for next build, although not by much for now. We like the new mechanic, but Effuse, EF, and Gust of Mists are all pieces of the tuning picture that may shift around as it settles in. The nerf to mastery coefficient is simply to account for the fact that it now encompasses more spells, as would happen with any mastery. In fact, spreading the mastery benefit out slightly is something people have asked for.

Retribution Paladin Feedback -- Build 21531 -- 21-Apr<br />
Some response on the intention with the Mastery for AoE would be appreciated. We've been asking for this for a while - it doesn't matter when changes are actually made, but some insight into the thought process would be more productive. Hard to give feedback on something that's clearly not working as it will when Legion goes live but it would be possible if we knew what your red lines and design philosophies were. Having the judgment debuff be a buff on the player would solve the issue completely and doesn't go against any stated design philosophies, so there must be something not being said that's the issue.<br />
It's intended that Mastery is a single-target DPS stat for Retribution Paladins, but that the Greater Judgment talent can extend that to AoE. It will be tuned to account for that. This is certainly not the first time that different stats have had wildly different values in different situations, and that's OK.<br />
<br />
So we are going with the Clarity of Power route. Glad that's finally been cleared up. Anything to say for Zeal, a talent that's located on the same tier and literally doing the same thing as Greater Judgment (AoE)?<br />
It's worth noting that Fires of Justice does the same thing too. You generate holy power faster and therefore cast more divine storms than you otherwise would. Different damage talents will perform a bit differently in different situations, but in this case none of them are actually purely single-target or AE.

Holy Paladin Feedback -- Build 21531 -- 21-Apr<br />
There are some additional upcoming changes to Holy Paladin talents that did not make it into this build. Next build, we will be trying out 3 new talents, with the intention of giving more options to increase average complexity on Holy, and allowing for certain gameplay elements the class has had in the past (such as timing multiple independent cooldowns).<br />
<br />
1) Holy Bolt talent replaced with:<br />
Bestow Faith: Instant, 12s cooldown, costs 6% mana. After 5 seconds, your target is healed for 450%*SP.<br />
<br />
2) Sanctified Wrath moved to level 90 to replace Daybreak. Sanctified Wrath’s old slot on level 75 replaced with:<br />
Holy Avenger: Instant, 90s cooldown. Increases your Haste and Holy Shock healing by 30%, for 20sec.<br />
<br />
3) Stoicism replaced with:<br />
Fervent Martyr: Passive. Casting Holy Light or Flash of Light on your Beacon of Light reduces the mana cost of your next Light of the Martyr by 35%, stacking up to 3 times.<br />
<br />
Thanks!<br />
<br />
We discussed both versions of Fervent Martyr (reduces health cost and reduces mana cost). The health cost version is more comforting in a way--you get to ignore the obvious visible downside of Light of the Martyr. That's why we decided we liked it less. Removing LotM's mana cost makes it a very strong and efficient cast to add to your rotation, but you still have to engage with the distinctive mechanic of the spell. If you want to avoid dealing with the downside of LotM, this talent doesn't help you, but if you want to improve its value and potential, it does.<br />
<br />
We don't want Bestow Faith to be no-cooldown because that would give Holy a second no-cooldown spammable instant (we explicitly don't want gameplay akin to Rejuv here). A shorter cooldown might be an option for more flexibility and to not be so similar to Holy Shock's cadence, with mana being a more relevant limiter. But this version lets the efficiency and impact be higher when it's used well.<br />
<br />
I can see a valid problem with Fervent Martyr being that HL/FoL on Beacon is too infrequent of a trigger (which would be an issue regardless of what the reward was). But, it is okay if the strength of the talent comes out in dungeons or heavy tank healing situations, as SW and JoL are are both solid in normal raid healing. The talent is ultimately similarly tuned whether the cost is health or mana (they're roughly equally important parts of the cost). The mana cost of LotM, while low, is high enough that reclaiming 1/3 of it on each HL/FoL is a significant refund. For example, it effectively reduces the cost of HL-on-tank by 30% and an FoL-on-tank by 22%--very substantial efficiency gains in scenarios where you are healing a tank often. Reducing the health cost would be a more viscerally felt and easily visible reward, to be sure, but we felt keeping the inherent tradeoff of LotM intact was worth setting up the talent primarily as an efficiency reward for people who use it.<br />
<br />
With old Stoicism out, we are also going to try a lower health cost on LotM next build.<br />
<br />
Have you considered a %current health for a LotM cost? I really would like to not kill myself when I accidentally crit which could happen frequently given how much we value crit.<br />
When LotM's self-damage did not depend on the healing done, that wound up making the strength of the spell rely too much on crit/mastery scaling. And, the damage from each LotM cast is a small % of total health--if the possibility of a crit means you must avoid using the spell below 20% health even if you want to, that's totally fine. You should feel like it's a risk, that you probably want to avoid, to cast it when you're that low.<br />
<br />
It's also likely that Paladins aren't very constrained by mana right now compared to everyone else, but we haven't gone through and made more tuning changes yet.<br />
<br />
But, yes, we agree--you'd probably never cast LotM when you're below 20% health (you probably wouldn't do that regardless of the crit situation), and that's how it should be. But if you're at 100% and have a tank getting burst, or want to move while some raid members are low, it can easily be chosen over Flash or Light.<br />
<br />
The other option for mana is to simply keep Flash of Light being our mana dump, which I am personally fine with. Increase the base healing of Flash of Light and the mana cost a bit to differentiate it from Holy Light.<br />
This is something that's a definite possibility as we look at tuning more--we understand the differentiation between these two may be too low.

Holy Priest Feedback -- Build 21531 -- 21-Apr<br />
I'm not sure the &quot;overheal&quot; argument about Apotheosis is convincing. It's not dramatically more of a healing burst than many cooldowns healers find good use for (e.g. Avenging Wrath, and certainly not Tranquility). There should be ample situations where casting 3 or 4 Serenities or Sanctifies in a 30s period is easy to do effectively. When there aren't, when damage is too flat to make an extra cooldown attractive, CoH and Benediction will fit very well.<br />
<br />
We do understand that the cooldown is causing you to cast many more spells without increasing their efficiency (other than the gain from working in a few Holy Words, which are more efficient than normal spells). That's can a dubious benefit in a world where mana is more important limitation. In an upcoming build we're going to try having Apotheosis reduce the cost of Holy Words while it's active.<br />
<br />
Activated Spirit of Redemption is not likely to be a good talent for PvE. Its main benefits are 1) mana-free casting (not that unique, and would have to be on the power level of something like Mana Tea) and 2) total immunity to everything (something that usually causes complications PvE context).

Discipline Priest Feedback -- Build 21531 -- 21-Apr<br />
purge the wicked now procs power of the dark side, hooray!<br />
<br />
You fixed Power of the Dark Side and Purge the Wicked... what am I supposed to complain about now?<br />
I couldn't deprive you of the excitement of discovering this on your own when the build went out.<br />
<br />
It looks like something may be off with Shadowfiend, but in general, the existing bugs that we knew of with Atonement and level scaling should be fixed--please let us know if you see any more issues.<br />
<br />
Those situations are relatively rare, and spells like Shadow Mend are perfectly serviceable, if suboptimal (sometimes hardly even suboptimal) ways to get through them. Talents like Penitent, Grace, and CoW can also help a great deal when it comes up.<br />
<br />
There's nothing wrong with choosing talents to suit that situation--that's the sort of thing we want to be happening with talents.<br />
<br />
Purge still doesn't bounce as it's supposed to (now that we know what it's supposed to do). At least in the open world. I'm adding some mobs with halo, they all stack up and Purge doesn't get spread sometimes.<br />
<br />
Next build, PtW should correctly jump to targets that are behind you. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/409062-discipline-priest-feedback-build-21531-21-apr/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20743394339?page=1#16))<br />

Agreed. Not intended for Symbols of Death to cost Energy when applied through Phantom Assassin. Fixed in an upcoming build.<br />

It has a reasonably long cooldown. There are ~50 or so world quests up at a time.<br />

I'm hoping that, for the emissary quests (i.e., do a set # of quests to get an RNG bag), you can select the type of quests you want to do.<br />

For instance, professions (hopefully including gathering, as that's what I mostly do...), solo-quest dailies, and that sort. Requiring &quot;go after this elite rare&quot; would make doing the emissary objective tougher.<br />

Question, though: Are mythic dungeons (much less mythic+ dungeons) really something casuals are going to do?

Exactly this. If WoD had turned out to be an amazing expansion with diverse world content, then people would not have minded having the mission table as something available on the side as a form of offline progression. Sadly, that wasn't the case and the mission tables have gotten an unjustly bad rep as a result.</div></div><hr />

This thing is just like garrisons (IE: you'll switch out rare and epic random upgrading when you're level 100 and quest rewards are no longer upgrades, just like Dwarven Bunker). And I'm okay with that, except for follower upgrade items; I really, really hate doing those.</div></div><hr />

This must be that condition most developers or anyone on blizzards payroll suffers from, where their delusions manifest to everything around them, making them believe somethings greater then it actually is. This ass hasn't even seen lions pride in and how pixilated it looks, how it looks nothing like a grubby old style medieval inn.

Roughly half. I was only half paying attention, but from memory the classes who will get that ability (in the current build anyway) are:<br />
<br />
Death Knight<br />
Paladin<br />
Mage<br />
Warlock<br />
<br />
<br />
Huh. I know there's more but damn if I can't remember it. Frostworm, power of the Light, might of Dalaran, an infernal... Nope, I'd have to look.<br />
<br />
Anyway. It's more than mages, but it's not every class. And some classes get a free bonus roll token instead while others don't, so.</div></div><hr />

It really, really isn't. It's a button with a 3-day cooldown to complete one low-tier daily quest that requires seven whole days and a ton of resources to gain all so you can save yourself (going by the Tanaan jungle objectives) 10 minutes of time. Given that the missions seem more worthwhile this time, being able to generate follower items seems like a more efficient use of the tier.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It depends, level 1 is slightly tougher than heroic for example, normal and heroic are easier (some mechanics still kill you in no time if you don't know what to do) this expansion than other expansions at least i feel this way simply because now you have mythic+ to make it as difficult as you want so to say. So i think casuals will do mythic dungeons but won't get a super high mythic level. But even at a lower level it's still pretty challenging.</div></div><hr />

artifact knowledge will boost my artifact power gains and will make off-specs easier too<br />

People don't want content they can only do after waiting days/weeks/months for it, they want either a lot of content they can do or content that is repeatable while still be engaging. Atm it doesn't look like blizzard provides either so yes there is bitching, because Legion looks like WoD now.<br />
<br />
Atm the second legendary, which are absurdly powerful by the looks of it, is gated behind a stupid grind AND wait time, and you need to make your garrison 2.0 better before you get better. So why not just give everbody 2 legendarys and make the 6th perk something good for the order hall?

<br />
I'm going to assume you mean &quot;you have to focus on one spec, because you have to grind to get the Artifact Knowledge multiplier (increasing the AP rate on alt specs) to advance your other specs.&quot;<br />
<br />
I think that you can grind alt-spec artifact power while playing in your main spec (e.g., running around as a Prot paladin, but building up your Holy paladin's weapon), but that means neglecting your main spec. At least until you have the Artifact Knowledge multipliers that increase AP from repeatable sources (i.e., not saving once-only quests so you can power-grind an alt-spec).<br />

It's not a lot to ask for - and I understand I'm posting this in a forum where people (kids) treat video games like they're real life and take them way too seriously, but I'm just not seeing the &quot;This is a GREAT expansion, just wait! You'll love it!&quot; comments. <br />
<br />
All the focus is on the end game rewards, and getting them. What's the journey like, before that? Are the new zones fun? Are they interesting? Any new lore that's worthy of attention? Any quests that stand out as well done, fun to do (bouncing bears in Hyjal), or really challenging and new? Any Wrathgate level awe inspiring quest lines? <br />

If there's one thing that could possibly sway me from my decision to never touch Legion or WoW again, is a bunch of people posting how FUN the game is. Because that's why I play video games - not to define myself, like so many WoW players, not to get bragging rights, but just to have fun. I think it's what keeps me coming back here (other than poking the kiddies in illegal server threads with pointed sticks), is the sign that the game is fun again. <br />

It's not a lot to ask for - and I understand I'm posting this in a forum where people (kids) treat video games like they're real life and take them way too seriously, but I'm just not seeing the &quot;This is a GREAT expansion, just wait! You'll love it!&quot; comments. <br />

As an alpha tester i can assure you that as far as now Legion looks like this :<br />
<br />
Leveling Experience - Like WOD and even better because you know -demons #TBCAmarcord<br />
<br />
&quot;Doing Things Outside RAIDING&quot; Experience - It is lik- OMG there is actually something to do, you have an Artifact to Level and therefore farming artifact power through pve/quest/grinding/profession, you also have Profession (profession Quest), you have Order Class Hall, which isnt Garrison no matter how much the minus habens of MMO C will banter, it is not remotely like Garrison get over it, you have Myth + and CM<br />
<br />
<br />
So yes, it is Great and FUN</div></div><hr />

<br />
I mean, it's all well and good for alt-specs, but people are going to be leveling a dozen or more alts, and if they have to do the same grind on an alt for their weapon (and then for alt-spec weapons) on alts, won't that be more tedious?<br />
<br />
(I honestly don't know. My alts mostly sat around in their garrisons.)</div></div><hr />

This is said as a person that generally likes leveling. Also each zone feels disconnected and like a mini-expac / patch in itself to me right now. I think this is due to the level scaling and no good flow between zones like in previous expacs where you got a quest to go to the next zone. In legion its like go to a zone do its quests/story finished... back to the hall pic another zone at random go do the same. I'm sure this great for some people but for me it sucks.</div></div><hr />

Legion is your last damn chance and you're still going to try shoving this BS down our throats??? If legion doesn't bring back the mmo feel I wouldn't be surprised if WoW subs drop below 2mil, come on blizzard, I actually had faith that legion would be good because its the final chance at keepiong your subs, but IMO from what i've been seeing and hearing from people who play legion, it seems like they didn't learn from WoD..</div></div><hr />

Issue is replayability. World quests needs to earn you Valor as well, and Valor vendor gear needs to be updated along with new tiers.<br />
It's cheap, but it works. And Legion needs it.<br />
<br />
Part of world quests are fine as a means to get geared shortly after dinging 110, but it also needs that &quot;timeless&quot; currency reward to stay compelling 2-12 months from release.<br />
<br />
And on that part, Artifact traits should perhaps be toned down for release, then gain additional tiers along with content releases, so you won't be AP capped 2 months into Legion and then never have to think about AP again.</div></div><hr />

You're right; it's one of my concerns. So far, my feeling is that it's quite replayable when you consider the entire offering of the endgame, including world quests, dungeon and raid systems. A number of additional world quests were added in a build after my post, for example.<br />
On the other hand, are we right to be *so* concerned? Considering how poorly early endgame was handled in WoD, Legion's offering makes up for this in spades - there's a clear line that separates starter 110 gear with heroic dungeons and higher.<br />
<br />
It's not possible for us to represent the viewpoint of the player majority, but I have a feeling that the majority will *not* AP cap in two months.</div></div><hr />

What about the journey from 100 to 110? The biggest disappointment for me in WOD is how fast leveling was over with, how poorly it was handled, and how pointless a lot of it felt - and the &quot;on rails&quot; thing is infuriating. I know the new zones are designed to combat that, but how are they to actually play?<br />
<br />
I know I'm in the minority, in that I want the level and depth of Wrath and TBC questing back. Wrath had the most leveling content of all of the expansions, and when I compared them on WoWHead, WOD was almost half of Wrath, and a little over half of what Mists had. The rush to end game is what concerns me a lot - a lot of players, myself included, enjoy the questing and leveling part of the game, and WOD it felt like an inconvenience, something they added, because they had to. How is it in Legion? I'm not going to buy Legion, I just want to know if they're even trying to provide more than a week of questing content for $60.</div></div><hr />

Beware, opinion ahead.<br />
Questing while leveling feels fluid out in the world. You'll find yourself traveling from small hub to small hub doing main quests, but also run into other small bites of questlines here and there. There're numerous visual queues that, if you're the exploring time, you'll want to check out. Paths aren't very obvious but they look and feel natural, and lead to a little something nice like a rare or a treasure thing.<br />
At the same time, you definitely don't cover the entire landmass of the broken isles. It feels pretty big when you've got your boots on the ground.<br />
Professions play a role in the leveling experience if you want it to as well (tip: start in Azsuna). These also have you traveling quite a bit, and more often than not you'll again find yourself going off the path to check out a *thing* you noticed in the corner of your eye.<br />
<br />
I'm not fond of analogies, but think of the questing and leveling similar to the legend of zelda or dragon age III. You're only as &quot;on the rails&quot; as you want it to be. If you do only the main quest and move on to the next area, there's a decent chance that you'll hit 110. But you're still compelled to stay out in the world and finish your questing experience since gear rewards scale, you'll continue to gain artifact power and the like. Suramar is also a zone entirely dedicated to 110 content. It just became available for testing so it's really, really rough on the edges, but I'm very pleased with the delivery. There's even a quest with a puzzle (!) I ran into. Nothing special, but I like the direction.<br />
<br />
If you rush, you likely can finish in a week or so, just like it was possible in every other expansion. If you do though, well that's your fault.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't care about PvE and the other stuff is awesome, but I am a PvP'er at the end that is what I look forward to. All those other things I love to do in between. But my main source/goal of end game is always PvP, and so far the classes I love to PvP with look like shit and PvP in a whole looks like shit so yes it is so terrible /s</div></div><hr />
