Fel Lord Zakuun 1 Shotting Tanks<br />
An unrelated hotfix broke this - sorry, I know it sucks to run into a brick wall on a farm night due to a bug. We're working on it, but it's not likely to be fixed within the next 30-60 minutes or so, for anyone who has a raid stalled and is waiting on an immediate solution. It will be fixed by tomorrow, for sure. But hopefully sooner.<br />
<br />
We just applied a hotfix for this issue, and phased/invisible Wakes should no longer be blowing up the raid. The hotfix may take a few minutes to take effect, but please let us know if you continue to see these issues. <br />
<br />
Since the fix seems to not have worked, we'll be looking into a different solution, but I have no ETA to offer other than &quot;as soon as possible.&quot; (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/380447-heroic-fel-lord-zakuun-1-shotting-tanks/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/18300812130?page=2#24))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Flying<br />
They're probably trying to hold flying off as long as possible, They didn't want to add it.<br />
The next minor patch will be up for testing as soon as possible. We're actively working on it. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/619274833847648256))<br />
<br />
Character / Items<br />
Just wondering if it is intentional that you can get 'The Consuming Void (http://www.wowdb.com/garrison/missions/686-the-consuming-void)' rare mission multiple times - Reward is an herirloom<br />
It's intended. The heirloom (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128318-touch-of-the-void) comes in a bag (http://www.wowdb.com/items/128319-void-shrouded-satchel) that is unbound and can be traded or sold. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/618939102436589568))<br />
<br />
Do you feel the melee trinket from Supreme Lord Kaz is to weak compared to the caster one?<br />
It’s definitely not a competitive DPS trinket, nor is it trying to be. It’s more a potentially interesting utility option. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/618939728323162113))<br />
<br />
Soaring Skyterror engine sounds during flight intended? or simple oversight?<br />
Not intended. A new sound set is required. This should be fixed in the minor patch that enables flight. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/619285156717707265))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
just stay calm.Remove EMFH and anyone tell bad things to you.Just remove it pls save the PvP <br />
Mental experiment: What if Wild Gladiator's Medallion of Adaptation had +3000 Versatility. How good would EMFH be? (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/619199105936568320))<br />
<br />
Garrisons<br />
any reason why demolishers from engy building had attack speed slowed in 6.2? they were only good for invasions/world boss :-(<br />
The no-CD attack speed allowed for many, many, many attacks at once. This was not intended. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/618939377067003904))<br />
<br />
Do i need to wait the full expiration of an abrogator mission via ships to get the runes missions? I've had it since last week.<br />
Timeout was added in a future update, but you should run the mission to get to the runes missions. (1/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/618950667810443264))<br />
The update, unfortunately, will only apply to missions not already in progress. (2/2) (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/618950740497727488))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler has recently provided (http://ask.fm/RiotGhostcrawler) longer answers to some questions than tweets would allow. <br />
What would you say is the holy grail of a system designer?‎ <br />
Someone who can identify a potential design problem (often before players do) and suggest the perfect design change to solve that problem. &quot;Perfect&quot; means a lot here -- it has to resonate with players, it has to be easy to implement, it has to future-proof the problem, and so on.<br />
<br />
The problem could be something like a bug fix or something like a game missing a major feature that will help keep players engaged for time to come. <br />
<br />
What made you decide to leave WoW for League?<br />
I had been working on WoW for six years and it was largely the same work for those six years. I realized I had started to get a little bored and I feared that boredom would lead me to making designs that entertained me as a designer, but weren't actually good for players. I looked around at other opportunities and none of them really spoke to me, though I strongly considered Diablo. I was a big Overwatch fan, but that team was pretty full on designers, and I didn't want them to have to create a space for me. I like solving problems and I get bored when there aren't a lot of problems dropped in my lap to solve.<br />
<br />
Speaking of which, Blizzard was a mature company by that time. It still had (and probably has) some problems as an organization, as I'm sure any current employee would freely admit. And I don't want to give the impression that it's some deeply flawed company. It's not. It was a great place to work and I am still really close to a lot of my friends there. But the problems that remained to be solved were deep-seated, hard-to-solve problems, the kind that take radical culture shifts to address. They may not even be critical problems to solve, but they didn't feel like problems I was going to get a lot of traction on, and like I said, I get bored when I'm not doing just that.<br />
I'll give you just one example. Blizzard has a lot of folks who have been there a long time. That makes it difficult to carve off leadership opportunities for the next generation of high performers. If you want to be a lead, and your team has a roster of stable leads, and every team has a roster of stable leads, where is your potential for upwards mobility? Many mature organizations with low turnover have this problem, but as I said, it's a hard one to solve!<br />
<br />
But then we come to Riot. Here is a pretty young company with a lot of young developers and a whole lot of new company problems to solve. But I saw right away that many of them were the kinds of things I was good at solving. I knew how to fix that shit. I knew I'd be able to make a big difference at a young company and quickly.<br />
<br />
Now solving problems is fulfilling and all, but it still wouldn't be a good fit if I wasn't aligned with the company values. But holy crap that ended up being such a good fit. Riot believes in teams that can act with a lot of autonomy. (I hate being constrained and I love being able to move fast without a lot of gatekeepers.) Riot believes in investing a lot of time in growing and mentorship. (Many of my most rewarding moments in this career have come from just that.) Riot believes in interacting with players. (Any of you who know me know how important it is for me to reach out to players. I'm doing that now!) It's not that I was misaligned with Blizzard values, it's just that the Riot values fit me perfectly.<br />
<br />
I do think League is a great game, but there are a lot of great games out there that I could have worked on. I chose League because of Riot. <br />
<br />
What has been your most frustrating moment during your time as a game developer?‎ <br />
I'm not sure I could come up with the *most* frustrating. It was probably a bug I couldn't fix or an editor crashing and losing hours of work.<br />
Microsoft killed a lot of cool Ensemble game pitches for what seemed like bad reasons. That was frustrating. I wanted to be more bold with the design of WoW than was probably prudent for the game, but it was a little frustrating. Whenever players try to reverse-engineer why we make certain decisions and conclude its some internal political reason I get frustrated. When they claim we're out of touch or don't care, I get frustrated. <br />

<br />
Nobody seems to ever stop and consider, maybe it was the other way around? I mean, they would have been starting pre-production on WoD probably 3 years ago by now, about the same time Duncan Jones/Legendary people would have been doing pre-production on the movie and picking their brains about Draenor and characters like Gul'dan and Durotan. Maybe as the Blizzard guys talked more about these old characters and dredged up old lore and old stories they remembered how much they loved this old stuff and thought, hey, why not bring it back into the game?<br />
<br />
I dunno, nobody knows, we're all just guessing and speculating. Doesn't really add up that the expansion was to help the movie though considering the movie is still like a year away, and its not really the WoW players it has to appeal to be successful, its everyone else. Fans of WoW would likely go see it either way, they don't need to be sold on it.</div></div><hr />

I don't get this...is there something else they could've done that would have made it look better? And is avatar considered a bad movie? I thought it was pretty damn awesome...<br />

<br />
Well no shit. I highly doubt they're expecting this to be the next record-breaking blockbuster. It's a movie produced for an incredibly small target audience, relatively speaking when compared to most of the other movies that have been in theaters within the past decade.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">reikoshea</div><div class="date">2015-07-15, 07:53 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">It definitely seems like sound design is not even close on that clip. It's definitely missing a real score, and the sound effects didn't sound complete. The was NO sense of immersion trying to be obtained with that set of focus group clips (so called because it's not a teaser or a trailer).<br />

I think that was more about how people would react to the Orc design, than as a trailer for the movie. That being said, I thought the design was good, even with the poor video quality. My feed back would be, even through the WoW orcs have a very particular style (which was followed exceptionally closely), it is awkward watching someone speak with a very large lower jaw. I don't know if there's a way to get the art style and still be able to relate. I tend to watch peoples lips as they talk, and that definitely did not work in this case (even after taking the clip and re-syncing the audio a smidge).<br />
<br />
I'm still kind of pissed at legendary for not releasing SOMETHING to the public officially, I would have liked to have seen this in full quality rather than a cell cam, but this definitely hasn't changed my opinion on seeing the movie. It just makes me hope that they'll spend the next 10 months refining the sound, and ADR to make an epic movie feel more epic. The scene with guldan i think was visually appearing, but even as an agent of the Legion, he just seemed a bit flat.<br />
<br />
I look forward to seeing more.</div></div><hr />

Why dont people wait until they get to the point where they are happy to actually release a trailer to the public before they start their criticisms. This is for comic con, for die-hard fans, of course they get some pre release footage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, when it came out it was considered a bad movie (bad acting, bad story, etc) saved by amazing effects (saved if you're impressed by CGI anyway, I have always preferred animatronics/realism), years from now it will just be a bad movie with outdated effects (think Lawnmower man).<br />

Hopefully Warcraft won't be just another Avatar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
World of Warcraft Franchise fanbase is pretty huge. If you look at over a 100 million unique wow accounts (let's say 60% aren't bots).<br />
<br />
That's still 60 million possible fans that will be interested and if a small chunk of those go, you easily sit at $500 million revenue. <br />

That would already double the budget value, and would be more than sufficient to result in a sequel.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The #1 thing I will point out is complete lack of pacing:<br />
They are using all this CGI to have characters walk VEERRY SLOWLY, pan across the landscape VEERRY SLOWLY and talk to each other VEERRY SLOWLY, with an absurd number of pauses between words and pauses for &quot;meaningful glances&quot; between characters. And much of what they talk about is boring angst, omg I'm hungry, omg I worry about my wife, omg I'm preggers what will I name my baby? This is gonna be like Pearl Harbour. Come in expecting a movie about war, instead 75% of the movie is a love story and domestic issues.<br />
<br />
Just because they're orcs instead of actual actors does not make characters walking and slowly talking to each other interesting. How can a trailer/promo footage make you fall asleep? Just compare this with the Batman vs Superman trailer, not a moment is wasted. I was like &quot;GET ON WITH IT&quot; through most of the Warcraft trailer. <br />
<br />
Also huge orc bias/focus.<br />

Delusional much? No one sane would never make a movie aiming for original fanbase, that's the best way to waste time and money.

<br />
I'm confused by this whole conversation.<br />
<br />
If you go and watch Lord of the Rings the whole trilogy is full of bad campy acting, silly over the top themes and CGI that looks horrible compared to modern day.<br />
<br />
Avatar was a perfect movie with some of the greatest effects and was one of the biggest things of its time.<br />
<br />
If one doesnt want to watch something because its like Avatar and not like LoTR then somehow you have stumbled upon one of the few ways to have a wrong opinion.<br />
<br />
(I loved LoTR and appreciate the experience but i tried to get my best friend to watch it and halfway through Two Towers i decided to stop because it was just to damned corny)<br />

No, this is rationalism. Generally fans just go watch any movie that's tied or derived of the franchise they like.<br />

LOTR/Hobbit Orc scenes don't look real either, but it's when you combine them with humans in the scenes, it looks believable enough.<br />

That's generally with every CGI movie, they need humans to keep the balance in the movie, with real and created content.</div></div><hr />

I hope you are right, because for a movie which is supposed to rival Avatar in CGI, this looked very very underwhelming, the animation for the orcs was kinda stiff, and the models themselves look kinda plastic...

<br />
1. Unfinished Clips - AKA not yet polished, missing proper sound, missing final rendering ... list goes on<br />
2. NOT a trailer ... so stop calling it that ... it is just random clips at this point ... most likely what has been worked on the most by the CGI team.<br />
3. Orc's CGI, DUH ... <br />
4. This video was cut short ... so we don't know the rest that was shown per say (go read the transcripts if you are really that desperate)<br />
<br />
Okay with all that said ... Given what Blizzard has made video wise ... On par for early released video ....<br />
Does it look like a blockbuster yet? No ... Does it give away a bunch of %$#@ we don't already know? No<br />
It is simply raw footage ... that is all<br />
<br />
I for one enjoyed what I saw (knowing was going to be CGI heavy) ... wish they could have had an official one.<br />
I will reserve judgement until at least Nov when we get an ACTUAL trailer ... If it still looks like this ... well then... /sigh</div></div><hr />

<br />
I will say this though, there was an excessive amount of &quot;meaningful pauses&quot;, as someone mentioned, which is cliche. Then again, maybe the footage is from a portion of the movie that warrants it like in the middle somewhere. i know that if the entire movie was styled in this manner, it degrade the immersive attachment to the characters.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm...The dev team is about 3 builds ahead of the live version.<br />
<br />
There's a version in active development (7.0 patch) that involves writing and scripting quests and building terrain or placing doodads; a build in polishing/finishing work which actually takes the longest time (6.3 or whatever) where they tie in all the missing stuff, apply voice-acting, check all the sounds and graphics, etc...; and a testing/QA build that is about to deploy and making sure there's no latent bugs/glitches. I'm probably wrong since i've never worked at Blizzard but that's how i imagine they work. So the Timeout WAS added in a future update, it's probably in the 2nd or 3rd build right now and will be deployed when ready.</div></div><hr />

The CGI displayed there is more expensive than getting some randies in orc costumes and filming at locations, and then touching them up afterwards.<br />
<br />
Also, considering how buff the orcs from Warcraft are, not a single actor would be able to move under all that prosthetic.<br />
CGI was probably the only choice they could have gone. Also, phone camera and microphone. Best representation of a movie's quality, amiright?</div></div><hr />

I just hope that they're still working on the orchestral score right now. Even though the sound isn't great either I wasn't impressed by the music in the clips. Hopefully that's just placeholder music. Blizzard's music department is one of the only departments that does a top notch job every time, which is why I was saddened that they got Ramin Djawadi to compose the score rather than getting to people who live and breathe Warcraft music every day to do the score. We'll see.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. It's a cam. Colors, animations, sounds are terribly off due to the bad cam shot (still thanks for that!)<br />
2. Voice acting - I'm sure this is really not done. At least, I hope. For it is in fact at this stage incredily hollow, horrible and the voices do not fit (except maybe Gul'dan)<br />
3. Taken with the above first comment: textures, animation - yes, it feels not as smooth as I'm used to see in trailers from blizzard (WoW, Warcraft, StarCraft etc). We'll see.<br />
4. Motions: see 3.<br />
5. lightning: no judging here, CAMs rip these apart anyways<br />
<br />
Now...story...at least from my little glimpse of the horde side seems...meh. The speech Gul'dan gives, the mediocre casting, the bad &quot;grunting&quot; and the &quot;storming&quot; orcs did not give me goosebumps. And that's not a good first impression.<br />
<br />
I'll wait and see what the real trailer brings once it's officially out there.</div></div><hr />

They said a couple years ago the warcraft movie was going to be based off the RTS Orcs vs Humans. And people not being fans of CGI well idk how else you would do a warcraft movie otherwise. I didn't mind Avatar's CGI the thing I didn't like about Avatar was political agenda throughout the movie and making it seem like the humans are bad and climate change bs, and we're invading their space like our ancestors did to native americans that's what bugged me.

Pick a movie that you think has good video effects, and then find an early torrent version of it filmed with a mobile phone in the cinema. If it looks good, THEN you have a problem with this one, but it wont look good. So maybe don't judge a movie's cgi quality by an excerpt filmed with a Nokia 3310</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it's been said enough, but the first film is about Orcs vs Humans, so people complaining their are orcs in the movie are just.. stupid, or twelve.<br />
<br />
I like the CGI. It's very reminiscent of WoW's famous CGI trailers. People have been begging for a CGI movie from Blizz since Warcraft 3 and now we more or less have it. Seeing people complain about it here is laughable.<br />
<br />
My only gripe is Gul'dan. Daniel Wu is a great actor but he is totally misscast here. There -hundreds- of actors that could have done the role better. Hell I'd be happy if Troy Baker did the voice for the movie. He absolutely rocked the role of Gul'dan in WoD. Daniel Wu however, sounded off, drab.. didn't fully capture the character of Gul'dan. Just my two cents atleast.<br />
<br />
I like the rest of the voice acting though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hopefully Warcraft won't be just another Avatar.<br />
<br />
Animatronics are great, but to create Orcs with conventional effects, you have to use prosthetics, which are painfully limited. The problem has always been that prosthetics don't allow actors to emote properly. That's where I think CGI trumps conventional effects completely, and where Avatar served as a proving ground. To create Warcraft Orcs, CGI was absolutely mandatory. And when it comes to CGI humanoids, Avatar is the benchmark.</div></div><hr />

Hopefully Warcraft won't be just another Avatar.<br />
<br />
Considered by who? You? Actually, Avatar received praise across the board from critics and non-critics alike (83% from critics, and 82% from fans on rotten tomatoes.) You have a right to your opinion, but don't spew your bullshit on the forums pretending like the masses agree with your viewpoint. Avatar was great, and if Warcraft is anything like that in terms of quality, I would imagine it would be a success as well.</div></div><hr />

What do you expect? The Trailer from the games are expensive to make and a full movie in that quality would be too expensive. There is a reason why most cutscenes today are done with the in-game 3D engine and not prerendered.<br />
<br />
I think the movie captures the Warcraft style perfectly. It needs to be a little bit comic style with comic proportions to stay true to the games.</div></div><hr />

Avatar may have been a terrible script, and had terrible acting, but it is one of the most visually awe inspiring movies I have ever seen. I hope it looks as good as Avatar, or better considering it's been a few years since then.</div></div><hr />

Why do people think, we have real life orcs so we can avoid 90% of CGI Orcs.. Like really. how else are they suppose to make over sized human like orcs. i dont see hulk size orcs anywhere since they are roughly the size of hulk (slightly smaller).</div></div><hr />

It looks to me like they got the Warcraft style right at least, which I'm thrilled about. (Someone complained about the hands being too big etc. Honestly?!? Have you played any Warcraft games, ever?) If the whole thing looked like a cinematic I'd still watch it, and probably be thrilled. I've never seen a Blizzard cinematic and not thought: I want more of that!</div></div><hr />

Lol, it was highly applauded for it's effects however also heavily panned at the time for being basically a pocahontas ripoff with blue aliens instead of Indians. The acting was subpar and the story was dire, the only difference between it and a straight to DVD disaster was the AMAZING effects which served as an exhibition/benchmark of the new 3D technology. The problem is it hasn't aged well, the acting is still dire, the story still rubbish and the effects are still great but now awesome (mainly because they worked best in a 3D cinema), but this will not hold true forever though (see the previous Lawnmower man reference).<br />
<br />
It was a massive hit but has proven to have the staying power of disappearing ink, when was the last time you heard anyone say &quot;I watched Avatar again last night, it's still awesome&quot;, you don't because nobody says &quot;I know what I'll rewatch Avatar tonight&quot;. People will freely re-watch the LOTR films, Terminator 2, and all sorts of classics but nobody really rewatches Avatar because it's a showoff film with no substance, once you have seen the effects you have seen the effects and that's all the film ever had going for it, just like Lawnmower man and many others.</div></div><hr />

This timeframe allows them to explain the story right from the start so everyone can become familiar with the characters, the story, and the events. How many people do you think read The Lord of the Rings or The Hobbit prior to the films and look at how much money those films brought in. It surely wasn't only from fans.<br />
<br />
If we can enjoy the in-game Warcraft cinematics, why the hell is it such a bother for a film to rely heavily on CGI? Because it has a Legendary logo instead of a Blizzard logo and is shot on a shitty mobile camera?</div></div><hr />

It's only a portion of the con footage - the clip is a bit over four minutes, while reports from the con say the full sequence shown was almost double that length, with the first half showing orcs and the second showing humans.</div></div><hr />

Again, you keep speaking for everyone else when it's simply your own individual opinion. Take a look at the majority of the comments in this thread defending Avatar. Take a look at the rotten tomatoes reviews that pretty much go against everything you say. Take a look at the countless awards the movie has received. Take a look at the records the movie holds. I really don't know what you're talking about. I love watching the movie over again. If I'm channel surfing and I happen to come across it, I usually stop. Of course there will be people that don't like it, you can't please everyone. But please stop stating that the movie was widely panned when you are obviously wrong. To each his own.</div></div><hr />

I don't give a shit if it's CGI personally. It looks fucking fantastic.<br />

Well no shit. I highly doubt they're expecting this to be the next record-breaking blockbuster. It's a movie produced for an incredibly small target audience, relatively speaking when compared to most of the other movies that have been in theaters within the past decade.<br />
<br />
No, it isnt. Time and again, its been said this is a movie for general audiences. Marketed to them. Its not some niche film. Its(in their minds) supposed to stand up with LotR.</div></div><hr />

Considering they are a completely different representation of orc..... so grats on comparing apples and oranges as far as aesthetics go. I never said not use ANY CG, Im saying use SOME real shit.

No thats what you get when you use a human in make up, and the limitations it has in the design of your creatures. So congrats on missing the point. Its not comparing apples and oranges, its comparing CGI to people in makeup. You are also critiquing a films quality from a low res video of a computer screen, lol I mean really you can't tell what quality the ACTUAL video is. Also you are looking at clip of a CGI group, IE the Orcs, its going to be 100% green screen and Motion Capture. I mean really. The critiques are absurd.</div></div><hr />

Going to SDCC itself is a treat. Being there among fans, actors, directors, vendors and cosplayers is something otherworldly. Why take the one thing that is easily the most &quot;portable&quot; -- the trailers -- and make it exclusive? If anything, don't record/share the PANELS and use those to add value to the admission ticket. Share the sneak peaks with the fandom at large.</div></div><hr />

I like what I see, despite the idiot saying it's &quot;another Avatar&quot;.<br />
<br />
1) There is no way to properly portray Warcrafts Orcs without using GCI. Using practical makeup just would not cut it.<br />
2) There would be no real way to portray Dreanor without heavy CGI either, though Azeroth may be another story.<br />
3) Who cares if it is CGI?! If the CGI is good (which this looks to be) what does it matter? Personally I would PREFER they use CGI for this particular movie as it would ensure things look right (personally, I would prefer a 100% CGI movie rather than putting actual actors in it, when it comes to WarCraft, and done in the Blizzard cinematic style).</div></div><hr />

This is a comment from another website from someone who attended Comic-Con. And I quote:<br />
<br />
&quot;So from someone who actually got to see the footage live I can honestly say that grainy video and bad sound doesn't make it justice whatsoever.<br />
<br />
Also it wasn't a trailer, they just showed a couple scenes to show us where they're at. Half the footage here is missing, including a few live action alliance scenes. What this leaked footage also doesn't show is that the image spanned 3 screens and this leaked footage only shows the center one, so you're not getting the full picture.<br />
<br />
I thought it looked fantastic when I saw it live, in my opinion. I'll definitely be going to see it.&quot;<br />

I can tell very easily that it looks like a video game cinematic, not a live action movie. Hellboy is all practical. SFX teams could very easily make a REAL WoW orc. Instead they went the cheap easy way and made it all CG. It will look fake, we will be riding in the uncanny valley for most of the movie. It will have a lot of detractors for this. <br />
<br />
I could be wrong, I am about 15-20% of the time when it comes to movies. Feel free to bookmark and toss it in my face.<br />
<br />

its going to be 100% green screen and Motion Capture.<br />

We knew from the beginning that it was going to be heavy on CGI. How else would you accomplish all the creatures and zones in WoW? This has got to be the dumbest reason to not be interested in the movie. It makes zero sense. &quot;I'm going to compare this short clip to another completely unrelated film solely because they're both CGI heavy. And because I didn't like that film, must mean I should not like this one either.&quot; /facepalm<br />

lol Seems like what he meant flew completely over your head. He meant when people think they don't care he gets frustrated because it isn't true at all.

<br />
-Movie will not be WOW like, it will be WARCRAFT ORCS AND HUMANS like in terms of lore and story<br />
-Of course it's bloody CGI, this is what it was going to be. Tell me more about how on earth they are going to get the bulk of the orcs to look how they should if it wasn't?!?<br />
-It is poor quality with this leak, so if you are judging the detail based on this... I feel bad for you.<br />
-I think this will be good IF they do not rush it and actually take their time. If this is to be a trilogy like they thought or said the best way to put the first war into detail is three movies. But so help me god if they condense everything into one film like other movies do I will throw a lore based shit fit.<br />
<br />
For the nay sayers, I think the view point you have is based on unrealistic means. Turn on wow, start an Orc character, look at the details of their bulk and compare to Human size. CGI only way to go here.</div></div><hr />

This movie is being published by Universal and produced by Legendary, no movie studio in their sane mind would let a videogame company handle their marketing without any experience in the matter. When a movie leases the right to create an adaptation of someone elses work, the content creator AT MOST only acts as a &quot;consultant&quot;.<br />
<br />
It is not the first time Legendary is reluctant to share a trailer or footage of one of their movies this long from launch. <br />
<br />
It is like believing that JK Rowling had some serious hand in the Harry Potter's saga direction/production. At most, Legendary or Duncan asks a couple of guys in Blizzard some details about plot, scenery, overall feel of the characters, and that's it.</div></div><hr />

Hellboy is all practical. SFX teams could very easily make a REAL WoW orc. Instead they went the cheap easy way and made it all CG. It will look fake, we will be riding in the uncanny valley for most of the movie. It will have a lot of detractors for this. <br />
<br />
I could be wrong, I am about 15-20% of the time when it comes to movies. Feel free to bookmark and toss it in my face.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It doesnt have to be and LotR proves that, so does Hellboy.<br />
<br />
Are you serious?!<br />
A full movie of CG is far more expensive then making a movie without or with a little. <br />
Some people, sigh.<br />
<br />
I always hoped we got that oh so praised cinematics of Blizzard as a full movie, we get it and people complain ;)<br />
If it was all without CG then people will be like completely the opposite, that they wanted the awesome cinematics of what Blizzard created. <br />
<br />
I really give up, it's never ever good here on MMO.<br />
<br />
To the point, i'm so freaking excited to see this! :D</div></div><hr />

Blizzard (specifically Metzen) were heavily involved in the screenplay and Metzen is also co-producing it, but beyond that you are right. They had creative control in the beginning and were probably promised it would follow the story and art direction closely. Everything from this point on is out of their hands though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its a WARCRAFT movie based on the first game, not a fucking WoW movie. There is a difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
He gave me some very boring vibes. Everything felt really bland, voice acting, sound, fx, textures, etc. Hope it's really a pre-pre-pre-beta-raw-unedited-footage or something. Absolutely no immersion from what we see there (which totally compares to Avatar for me, never had any kind of immersion in that movie, felt like nothing but a long bland 3d tech demo). I'd love to see more of what it will look like when they're interacting with humans, definitely one of the most important part.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't get why some people say we shouldn't expect lord of the ring quality (for release version of course), first lotr movie will be 15 years old when this gets released, we should expect at least the same quality of humans + other races world, if not more.<br />
<br />
<br />
Just name one movie that doesn't have drama? Did you expect a movie with 120 minutes of constant war?<br />
<br />
Shoot'em up. 2 minutes intro, fight scene, ending credits. Good movie btw.</div></div><hr />

a wow factor does not mean World of Warcraf factor...</div></div><hr />
