Feral Druid changes coming soon (this week):<br />
<br />
Energy regeneration rate increased by 10% Rip damage increased by 15% Berserk duration increased from 15 to 20 sec Brutal Slash cost reduced from 30 to 25 energy Swipe cost reduced from 40 to 35 energy Thrash cost reduced by from 45 to 40 energy, and damage reduced proportionallyWe’re reducing the energy cost of Thrash but also proportionally reducing the damage. The goal is easier ramp-up time in AOE situations, while avoiding causing Thrash to be added to the single target rotation (since it's close to Shred's Energy to damage ratio), which we think wouldn’t make for a better overall rotation.<br />
The spec's hidden 50% increase to Haste secondary stat value reduced to 25%.This helps alleviate a secondary stat scaling issue, and both the Energy and damage loss should be overcompensated for by the increase to base Energy regeneration rate plus the other changes listed. We eventually want to remove this hidden bonus entirely, but since players have already made gearing choices based on Haste being their best secondary stat, we don’t want to upset that in the short-term, so we’ll do this in two parts.<br />
<br />
The sum of these changes is intended and expected to be a increase in Energy income, pacing, and damage in all situations.<br />
<br />
Other issues we've been talking about (future patch timeline):<br />
<br />
Better consolidate Energy-increasing and heavy pacing-impacting talents into the same row, and reduce the pacing impact that a single talent hasThe goal is to reduce the Energy/pacing swing between different talent builds, which allows us to bring up the bottom without letting the highest Energy/pacing talent build with endgame/late expansion gear to get near overflow range<br />
Better separate Single Target talents and Multitarget Talents into their own rowsThis is slightly more of a challenge on Druid specs than most specs, due to Druids having only 4 throughput talent rows (compared to most specs having 5), but it's a goal we have for all specs.<br />
Provide better AOE talent optionsEchoing suggestions - a combo-point spender is a possible direction. There may be an additional opportunity to do something with Thrash here. It functions as an enabler, but could be doing even more for the spec.<br />
BloodtalonsBloodtalons does a great job at adding complexity to the rotation, but we're not sure the method in which it does that is right for the spec long-term. Bloodtalons asks you to frequently cast a Regrowth in exchange for its buff, which in a group/raid, means either you're required to keep an eye on group/raid frames (which is a lot to ask) or you make a macro to mindlessly cast Regrowth on yourself (which isn't great).<br />
Remove the spec’s bonus to Haste secondary stat (currently on live 50%, soon to be 25%) entirely. Re-adjust Energy/pacing to compensate.Mentioned above, but now that Bleeds scale with Haste, it's both no longer needed to make Haste a relevant stat for Feral, and is also contributing to expansion-wide scaling issues.<br />
Remove cat form’s 40% bonus to auto-attack damage.This contributes to feedback that abilities don't hit hard enough and have low Energy to damage conversion ratios.<br />
<br />
Note that as we've mentioned before, we're watching overall class tuning and plan to make a general tuning pass later next week.<br />

Faction Changes and Honorbound / 7th Legion Reputation<br />
If you Faction Change your Honorbound or 7th Legion reputation will convert into the opposite faction equivalent.<br />
<br />
Keep in mind, however, that faction-specific quests and achievements won't be converted to their counterpart in the new faction. As a result, you will be required to complete the War Campaign in the new faction.<br />
<br />
Hope this helps.</div></div><hr />

They do, but not a lot. Basically each questline will give you 75 at the end. Also some optional quests give rep, but yeah... again not a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I may just do this myself. Yes, it sucks, but at least if you do that, the reputation doesn't reset. And the war campaign isn't bad. I would hate for my draenei to be horde (tauren, never blood elf. He's a paladin), but if it means less rep grind, it will be worth it (to me). If they had it like in Pandaria (250 rep per turn in, x2 rep if you buy a token at revered), then it would be bad. Well, it would have been nice if it was like in Legion, where you can do the rep on one faction (7th legion and honorbound counting as the same), but still needing a 120 character of the other faction to do the quest.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think you appreciate how bad Feral is right now. Like it's the worst it's been since probably TBC. Like in over a decade. It's historically bad. Frankly, this pass may help, but given all the other stuff &quot;they're looking at&quot; this isn't going to change the perception around much, it's still a very clunky, outdated, annoying spec to play for not all that great of a reward currently. I say this as a feral main since early Classic WoW, that has mained Feral this entire time and had great success along the way in PvE and PvP. The difference between playing Feral right now and switching to say Rogue or Ret or Survival Hunter or WW is just ludicrous.</div></div><hr />

You should have one, lest you don't have Predatory Swiftness and you click regrowth and you pop out of form to hard cast. <br />
<br />
Besides the good ferals have a macro to target their targets target for regrowth, and if no target, themselves. That way they constantly heal the MT in raids/dungeons and if not, themselves.</div></div><hr />

Feral is actually better than a few other specs atm. The amount of attention it's getting compared to specs like balance, elemental shaman, spriest, ect. is absurd. Don't get me wrong, it's in a bad spot, but THIS amount of attention when it's not even the worst is crazy.</div></div><hr />

Yes, this is true - I faction changed after completing all Horde quests in the first days - kept my reputation gains, got all new quests + all emissary and world quests I had already done so that was a massive boost - 3 extra emissarys.</div></div><hr />

Frankly, this pass may help, but given all the other stuff &quot;they're looking at&quot; this isn't going to change the perception around much, it's still a very clunky, outdated, annoying spec to play for not all that great of a reward currently. I say this as a feral main since early Classic WoW, that has mained Feral this entire time and had great success along the way in PvE and PvP. The difference between playing Feral right now and switching to say Rogue or Ret or Survival Hunter or WW is just ludicrous.<br />
<br />
Feral in Legion specially ToS raid patch was the strongest dps spec in the game and they were also very powerful at the end of Legion as well.<br />
<br />
Yes they are very weak dmg wise now in pve but their self heal in pvp? is way too powerful to the point that they are king in 1 vs 1 duels thanks to their awesome self heal.

<br />
I mean... I play a feral druid. Here's what I think in addition to general buffs that are described.<br />
<br />
Energy Generation: Rework Tiger's Fury - Increase damage dealt by 5% and energy regeneration by 25% for 12 seconds.<br />
<br />
Bloodtalons: Upon casting Tiger's Fury, increase bleed damage of the next 2 bleeds by an additional 5% for their full duration.<br />
<br />
Omen of Clarity: Buff to possible 3 applications of clearcasting.<br />
<br />
Remove Savage Roar and/or make it a baseline<br />
<br />
Replace Savage Roar slot with Sweeping Claws: Spend Combo Points to increase Swipe / Brutal Slash damage by x.x.x.x.x amounts for 12 seconds.<br />

<br />
What the buffs/nerfs consist of is a 15% buff to Rip damage and a rebalance of energy generation, with (1) some taken from haste, (2) some added baseline, and (3) the energy cost of certain abilities being adjusted.<br />
<br />
<br />
Thus far, that's it.<br />
<br />
<br />
And finally, the statement that &quot;(n)ote that as we've mentioned before, we're watching overall class tuning and plan to make a general tuning pass later next week&quot; means that there could be further tuning adjustments for feral to come.</div></div><hr />

What does 1v1 duels have to do with anything, like at all, in any regard whatsoever? I really don't foresee Feral being a critical component to several arena comps in a few weeks.

Little change really. Feral off heals haven't been changed and are still very powerful in 1v1 situations and in open world PvP the hit, run, reset play style will be just as deadly as ever. Rip will hit harder per tick, but depending on how the haste nerf goes, might not see as many ticks. <br />
<br />
In reality, if you find yourself in a 1v1 situation in world PvP with no hope of quick arriving help against a quality Feral that has a bug up his ass for you, you're going to die in most circumstance. Unless you play a well geared healer, particularly Disc Priest or maybe Rogue that can run and reset once bleeds have fallen off, or are one of the very few classes that can put enough distance to drop combat and mount up in the course of a stun and book it to safety. Even then, we can track you on the mini map and run almost as fast as a mount over short distances, and almost as fast over long distances, so I wouldn't dilly dally as a rake pounce is imminent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
#showtooltip<br />
/use [mod:alt,nocombat Player][help][@mouseover,nocombat,help] Player,nocombat]Regrowth<br />

/use [mod:alt Player][help][@mouseover,help][@focus,help][@targettarget,help] Player]Regrowth<br />
/console autoUnshift 1<br />
<br />
Also, unless you're some sort of beautiful mind savant, good luck using the default UI to actually play feral well. You're basically forced to use some sort of UI tweak to track the snapshots, and even then, you're hardly ever maximizing them.<br />
<br />
You also have classes that have AE on demand yet you don't balance feral to be slower ae but amazing single target. So basically you are playing, as others have said, a mediocre rogue with no good defensives, almost no real CC utility.. and a heal that you have to somehow maximize by &quot;ally healing&quot; (usually it is a self only macro, or focus tank macro)<br />
<br />
Feral druids are the one spec in the game that still has the legacy &quot;choice&quot; and it is night-and-day that the choices are completely empty and all you can do is make the wrong choice to lower your DPS. Snapshotting, and the required addons and interface to do it well, is absurd, where other classes literally press 4-5 buttons in an obvious rotation and are fine.<br />
<br />
The balance with feral is IMPOSSIBLE:<br />
<br />
if it is going to be ridiculously complicated, you'd have to give a bonus to the damage for pulling off a flawless rotation to match the complexity...except then talented guilds and players would stack that class.<br />
<br />
Meanwhile everyone who blows at feral (most people) barely keep up in most dungeons.<br />
<br />
It is proof that nobody important at blizzard actually listened to or played feral in alpha/beta or any of last expansion. This isn't a new problem, it is identical to legion's problem. It is just really obvious that a feral ramps up on one trash mob to do ONE AE when other classes are stacking multiple AEs and by the time the feral does one, the mobs are flat out dead.<br />
<br />
Look at the M+ class choices.<br />
<br />
Basically, feral is punished in PVE because of how godly they are in PVP. That's it. If their single target rotation is &quot;powerful&quot; or &quot;aligned&quot; in PVE, they become dominating gods in PVP because bleed + mobility = gg<br />
<br />
so they require this utterly ridiculous buff stacking snapshot to really maximize that DPS (and pull it under other specs/classes) so that burst isn't as controllable.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely zero reason to play feral, even after these changes, instead of a rogue, in any environment. You can pretend that you're going to buff one class to bring it in line with others.... but being the worst melee DPS barely ahead of tanks? Where other melee with amazing group utility AND survivability are 20-30% ahead? And can AE almost on demand? Yeah, not holding my breath on feral...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why? <br />
<br />
You literally have to modify like an extra 20 fields across a few spells to complete the stretch goals for Feral design changes. Why would you half-implement your intended changes, then wait and see. <br />
<br />
Like if I'm designing a space shuttle. I don't build half of it, then try to launch it and see if it makes it half-way to space. <br />
<br />
<br />
Better consolidate Energy-increasing and heavy pacing-impacting talents into the same row<br />
<br />
Then just do it? Move the talents around, it can't be worse than it is - in the worst case scenario you move it - you don't like it - and you move it back later. <br />
<br />
<br />
Better separate Single Target talents and Multitarget Talents into their own rows<br />
<br />
So do it? Just, do it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Provide better AOE talent options<br />
<br />
Just buff Brutal Slash. Everyone loves it, just make it good - like it was in Legion - how does this take an extra month to implement? How is this hard?<br />
<br />
Bloodtalons<br />
<br />
means either you're required to keep an eye on group/raid frames (which is a lot to ask) or you make a macro to mindlessly cast Regrowth on yourself (which isn't great).<br />
<br />
Mindlessly topping yourself off is never a bad thing, for most people that's fine. For everyone else who wants to watch raid frames, that's not a lot to ask - a lot of hybrids do this already to save people if shit hits the fan. All healers do is watch raid frames. For the fancy kitties who want to always get full value out of their Bloodtalon Regrowths, they can look at raid frames - for everyone else - just auto-heal yourself. My kitty has a bind for auto-heal and a bind for Regrowthing my target - it's not rocket surgery. <br />
<br />
<br />
Remove the spec’s bonus to Haste secondary stat (currently on live 50%, soon to be 25%) entirely.<br />
<br />
Whyyyyyyy. Why? We're all in trash pre-raid gear right now. Fix the spec. Nobody cares that their 320 haste/mastery belt is slightly less optimal after the nerf to haste scaling. Did you try polling the community to see if they cared about this? Haste scaling is not what they care about right now. <br />
<br />
<br />
Remove cat form’s 40% bonus to auto-attack damage.<br />
<br />
So do it? Remove it, buff all our ability damage by 10% or something, done. <br />
<br />
<br />
I will never understand the WoW team's ponderous approach to change. To say that it's like watching grass grow, would literally be an insult to grass.</div></div><hr />

Just because other specs need fixing, doesn't mean they can't prioritize, nor does it mean they are not looking into it. Feral is in a worse state than Ele Shaman.

It would seems not, lest this 'version' of feral wouldn't have made it through like 5 or 6 months of beta and a month or so of pre-patch Legion/BfA. How can a spec be so bad that would necessitate numerous drastic changes like immediately after a beta? This was all the stuff Ferals had been saying for quite literally months. Like was the class/spec designer(s) of Druids/Feral asleep at the wheel or something? And now they're like, &quot;Oh yeah, this spec is hot fucking garbage, WTF?

Bloodtalons asks you to frequently cast a Regrowth in exchange for its buff, which in a group/raid, means either you're required to keep an eye on group/raid frames (which is a lot to ask) or you make a macro to mindlessly cast Regrowth on yourself (which isn't great).Yes. Finally. Just take it off the GCD and PS and it will be fine. It is incredibly clunky when it's first on the GCD (when all you want to do is use your 5 combo points like you always did pre-Legion) and then also have to waste your PS on meaningless heals/roots (because the timing is terrible and everyone's already topped / dr'd). Futhermore you can't even use PS on meaningful heals/roots at all because then your damage would be horrible due to miss-timings (to the point of it virtually never being worth it). <br />
<br />
And to the people saying &quot;Bloodtalons is not rocket science&quot;, you're right it's not - but in relation to all other specs damage &quot;rotation&quot; the combination of bt/sr/tf most definitely is, and BT is the without a doubt the obvious offender here.</div></div><hr />

You are right my apologize I read that wrong.<br />
<br />
My point though that Feral was the best dps spec in ToS in Legion, and was pretty super good in Antorus.<br />
<br />
<br />
This pattern of Blizzard is kinda predictable I remember how good ret was in Wotlk (specially at the start of Wotlk) and how awesome after we got our Shadowmourne in icc patch then guess what happened next? inc Cataclysm expansion first few months of the expansion (specially the first raiding tier of Cata) we were so bad and unplayable in pve kinda like Feral now. So such scenario tbh is typical from Blizzard specially for players who played the game for a long time understand what I mean.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you like Feral you'd be much happier playing a Rogue.<br />
<br />
I agree with this for the moment. I'm still maining my Feral Druid, but I had a real hard time not selecting Assassination Rogue because it's just a much better flow. I think the main thing was that my Druid has been my main several expansions so the professions, reputations, etc are on that toon... and I hoped they'd fix the spec (which they are, yay!). Also I can't stand the visual / sound effect of Fan of Knives.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Velerios</div><div class="date">2018-08-30, 09:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Funny how quick they are to fix Feral Druid while we have specs like Elemental Shaman and Shadow Priest being left in the dust. I guess they do favor certain Classes much more than others (cough Shaman cough).<br />
<br />
Not entirely. BfA is already a big mess, but the difference here is that while Feral Druid is a big mess like Shadow Priest and Elemental Shaman, there is a BIG difference between them: Feral only needs numbers-changing and changing of mechanics that can be hotfixed.<br />
<br />
While Shadow Priest and Elemental Shaman needs changes of core abilities. They need to change completely the rotation and maybe even add some pruned abilities to make the spec not as crappy as they are now. Both of them are so bad that blizzard didn't do even numbers-tuning, because they already gave on the spec up until the next content-patch.<br />
<br />
Feral has it easier: a mess like many other specs, but at least the rotation is not in the gutter.</div></div><hr />

Oh gee, it took them six years to get the idea. I guess it will take them 6 years more to actually implement that concept. And then 6 years more again to implement it properly.<br />
<br />
Provide better AOE talent optionsEchoing suggestions - a combo-point spender is a possible direction. There may be an additional opportunity to do something with Thrash here. It functions as an enabler, but could be doing even more for the spec.<br />
Wrong.<br />
We're fine with NOT having an AOE finisher. We've tried to ask for one, but we gave up on that idea because nobody bothers to class/spec-design Feral cats properly since 2012. We got used to the idea of dumping our combopoints into a single Rip or a SR. That is fine, as far as Feral cats go. What we REALLY need is ANY AOE abilities that actually DO damage! Even now tab-stacking Rakes and Rips outperforms AOE ability spam in terms of AOE DPS. That's disgraceful.<br />
A Feral Cat Druid can either be decent at bursty AOE via BS swipes, or get an extra overall/single target rotation bonus via the Savage roar talent (pretty much mandatory for every PvE bossfight), which REPLACES 'decent bursty AOE'. These two are mutually exclusive. An arcane mage can deal both immense single target damage AND outstanding AOE damage even WITHOUT ANY talents. Same goes for Frost mages, WW monks etc etc etc. They don't even need the extra 'complexity'. But we, apparently, do.<br />
(Fun fact: a Feral Cat Druid used to have Ashamane's Frenzy. It was &quot;remake'd&quot; into Feral Frenzy --- for the sake of lulz and giggles, no less. Because nobody can afford picking that talent over two others.)<br />
<br />
BloodtalonsBloodtalons does a great job<br />
No, it doesn't. Get real.<br />
<br />
at adding complexity to the rotation<br />
Ah. So that was your goal? Add more 'complexity' to the class that was an epitome of complexity since 1812? Makes perfect sense to me. Almost as much sense as your glorified alternative realities. Are you gentlemen living in one? Cause that would totally explain a lot.<br />
You have a metric crapton of classes and specs that literally spend their lives baboon-style-mashing two keybinds. A Frost DK spec DEMANDS that the player does not involve his brain at all, instead poking a button that is highlighted at a certain time. Why not add some 'complexity' to them? Why not 'complexize' a BM hunter? An arcane joke of a mage?<br />
Bloodtalons was a stillborn child, a pinnacle of disgrace, a failed concept from the very day it was created. It DEMANDS that Feral druid spends his HEALING mechanic procs where DPS rotation demands instead of his actual SURVIVAL. This was a major failure. The extra GCD used for the HT dump was also a failure. Yet you cling to this rapidly decomposing corpse of a stillborn fetus like its your own soulbound ticket to heaven.<br />
It is not. Forget about this mockery incarnated and replace this mechanics with something halfway decent. Then we'll talk.<br />
<br />
Remove the spec’s bonus to Haste secondary stat (currently on live 50%, soon to be 25%) entirely. Re-adjust Energy/pacing to compensate.Mentioned above, but now that Bleeds scale with Haste, it's both no longer needed to make Haste a relevant stat for Feral, and is also contributing to expansion-wide scaling issues.<br />
You know what DOES contribute to expansion-wide scaling issues? Expansion-wide scaling. Another messed up concept.<br />
But alright, fine, we won't discuss that here and now. Let's talk about 'scaling issues'.<br />
WHAT SCALING ISSUES?!<br />
Just so in case you didn't notice, ladies, A FERAL DRUID (DPS spec) is currently GETTING OUTDAMAGED BY A DISC PRIEST (healer spec). What is wrong with you people? Just how messed up is that AU of yours you live in if you fail to comprehend the feedback we've been throwing your way ever since Beta kicked in? You refuse to address ACTUAL problems we report about, instead focusing on some nonexistant rainbows and ponies. What is it they're paying you for? Cause I might want to apply for a 'game designer' position at Actiblizzard if they guarantee that they'll provide me with the same daily dose of LSD you're getting.<br />
<br />
Remove cat form’s 40% bonus to auto-attack damage.This contributes to feedback that abilities don't hit hard enough and have low Energy to damage conversion ratios.<br />
This contributes to Protection paladins outdamaging Cats.<br />
Good job, Mr. Old Man Henderson.<br />
<br />
<br />
No, wait. Seriously.<br />
<br />
This contributes to feedback that abilities don't hit hard enough and have low Energy to damage conversion ratios.<br />
<br />
contributes to feedback that abilities don't hit hard enough<br />
...so we nerf your autoattacks. Because reasons.<br />
What.<br />
Just... what.<br />
How aren't you ladies fired from game design section by now?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pinkz</div><div class="date">2018-09-03, 05:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I don't think you appreciate how bad Feral is right now. Like it's the worst it's been since probably TBC. Like in over a decade. It's historically bad. Frankly, this pass may help, but given all the other stuff &quot;they're looking at&quot; this isn't going to change the perception around much, it's still a very clunky, outdated, annoying spec to play for not all that great of a reward currently. I say this as a feral main since early Classic WoW, that has mained Feral this entire time and had great success along the way in PvE and PvP. The difference between playing Feral right now and switching to say Rogue or Ret or Survival Hunter or WW is just ludicrous.<br />
<br />
i played a feral in classic and BC, had to switch to res druid for alot of stuff, feral was far from smooth, 2-3 shifts OOM 4 if you had talent for mana reduc shifts. feral and bal both. plus back then they did not have bottomless rejuvs, 2-4 OOM, bal druid could not hammer the keyboard with rejuvs/moonfires/sunfires. feral back then going to bear did not have spammable moonfire, was really hard to peel a rogue, or turn a fight on a rogue with crippling etc. today a feral can rofl get away, kite down a rogue with bleeds and moonfires<br />
<br />
BC era res druids where king, tons of resilience could carry ill geared players<br />
<br />
in the classic WOW and BC era....you needed different set of gear for each spec. feral cat agility based and bear strength based used different sets. if you played feral CAT you needed a near rogue set, and you needed a caster set for better heals and more man outside cat.<br />
<br />
that was a insane clunky era for druids, now gear shifts to you spec<br />
<br />
blizz has pruned other classes severely, imo druids are in a good spot with affinities....like feral cat with res druid affinity, or the res druid with guardian affinity which was QQ alot about in legion.<br />
<br />
feral was discovered to be good around mid WOTLK, so good mages were QQing, and the result was druid shifting was nerfed to &quot;no longer break roots&quot; later breaking root shifts was given to res druids only. next expac this was reverted.<br />
<br />
i will admit feral was not best in CATA, and MOP....that was the bal druid era, which appears is again end of legion into BFA<br />
<br />
WOD feral had their sunshine, able to somewhat vanish in a fight even with dots, and get another open stun bleed cycle etc going. they had a paladin type LOH heal. i remember in ashran they would drop players like candy wandering outside the mass group, plate, paladins, locks, etc. my FDK was able to fight a feral cat prior to WOD, no chance due to the buffs<br />
<br />
WOD ferals on one ability...opener got stun, ambush type attack, and a bleed, next attack was a restun with damage. they basicly got what required a rogue to use 5 abilities with 4 GCDs using more energy whiled feral did same with 2 abilities and 1 GCD and not energy dry in a wait a sec mode.. ferals were in a good spot in WOD....best ever next to that short period when blizz bowed to the mage union in WOTLK.<br />
<br />
LEGION was guardian druid god mode in WPVP turn, res druid guardian affinity, and bal druids shining in BG/arena/etc<br />
<br />
game is never balanced, it's a lot of....wait your turn balancing. some classes enjoy monster long streaks, like frost mage for 14 years. and ret pals since WOTLK</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ontis</div><div class="date">2018-09-03, 10:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">so good mages were QQing, and the result was<br />
<br />
Let me correct you. Mid-WOTLK Feralcats were the only class capable of killing Frostmages and Warlocks in duels.<br />
Let me repeat that again.<br />
...ONLY class capable...<br />
...in DUELS...<br />
...and the Scumbag Duo immediately whined a metric crapton of QQposts @ Battlenet forum section. Which led to I M M E D I A T E reshifting AND Berserk fear-immunity removal. Mind you, Lolrets (who used to be Ebola before Ebola went mainstream) weren't nerfed until a full arena season was over!<br />
We tried to find some reason with Whiny Casturrds. We tried to explain them that permafreezing literally ANY other class and winning 93% of duels is not what you'd call &quot;balanced&quot;. We tried to explain Craplocks that permaFearing anyone around while spamming /lol /rofl at them is not what you'd call &quot;balanced&quot;. We informed them that they DO, in fact, have a HORROR mechanic that used to penetrate Zerk Fear immunity, and that was Death coil - but dimwits didn't even bother assigning a keybind to that ability. They wanted to mash three buttons and instagib anyone. Billzord were all too happy to provide - and thus we received a Reshifting nerf (No More Shifting Out Of Roots And Novas) and Zerk Fear immunity neft (No More Fear Immunity During 3-minute CD Burst Ability Cuz Too OP Lul).<br />
And the mockery intensified even further then. A few weeks later Blizzard GRACED us with a reverse-buff, returning the reshift-breaking-out-of-snares mechanics...<br />
...to restoration and noobkin specs.<br />
Not to Feral spec that naturally revolves around shifting.<br />
And that was the day when the disgrace went just too far.<br />
<br />
I remember those days. That was the first time they permabanned me from Billzord Battlenet forums. And that was the first time I managed to get a hefty pile of explosives and Dear Santa'd them to Mr. Scumcrawler's mailbox. Needless to say, Feral cats received a nice DPS buff mid-Ulduar shortly afterwards.<br />
Those were the days.<br />
Unfortunately, nobody's willing to pass Scumzzicostas' address to me these days.<br />
Hence the outcome.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">pinkz</div><div class="date">2018-09-13, 02:13 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">let me correct you....mid season in WOTLK prot wars were also blowing up mages, because a charge talent only prot had, could break roots and stay on them. mages and those that hide on other class alts QQd...prot war insta nerfed<br />
<br />
ghostcrawler says people blame him for the overbuffing of mages......lol, yeah i do. and this mindset has continued thru 14 years of frost mage. yeah fire in van wow, arcane in cata, and arcane now again gets some brief sunshine, wonder if that will last. but it is so obvious when frost complains they are getting out DPS by hunters. arcane/fine mage how amazingly fast corrections/nerfs/buffs come.<br />
<br />
WOTLK the frost mage (mostly on frost) and disco combos were so insane, i remember the QQ on forums like you mention above that were counter frost mage, blizz exercised censorship. i remember i was going to post, but saw posts already covering the issue with solid complaints. i tagged them so i could look in progress and blue comments. five of them.....2 were flat out deleted, 2 were closed redirected to one....last one was shut down as non productive. but more and more popped blizz banned posters even on clean ones, censorship on anything frost. so if you went on the forums, amazingly same type anti frost mage posts and QQ on DKs and rets hid what was really going on in the game untouched by blizz<br />
<br />
blizz wiped the old WOW forum for CATA, however in CATA the QQ started right away...again frost mages along the lines of single frost mages again 1 vs 2 in PVP/arenas and more</div></div><hr />
