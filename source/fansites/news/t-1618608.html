Artcraft - Level Design Part 1<br />
Hi, I’m Chris Robinson, senior art director of World of Warcraft, and welcome to a special edition of Artcraft focused on environment and zone design. Previously we showed you what it was like to create the Spires of Arak (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/13987918/artcraft-the-spires-of-arak-5-6-2014) from a purely art-focused perspective, but over the coming days we’ll be releasing a series of articles focused on exterior level design, using Nagrand as a focal point. You’ll be hearing from the team who works with the artists, as well as the quest designers, systems designers, historians, and more to craft and create not only the zones we adventure in, but the visual story that is told about these locations and the creatures and races that inhabit them. For this first article, I’m pleased to introduce Julian Morris, our lead level designer.<br />
<br />
Hey everyone, Julian Morris here, lead level designer for the World of Warcraft exterior level design team.<br />
<br />
Exterior level design is the process of designing and constructing the zones of World of Warcraft, from Azeroth to Draenor and everything in between. Our team has planned, plotted, and designed the rise and fall of ancient cultures, as well as shaped mountains, forests, seas, lakes, rivers, roads, ruins, and every land feature imaginable. In addition to the land itself, we also design and create cities, towns, and Battlegrounds (with the random exterior dungeon or two in there every now and then, too).<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
The level design team is a hybrid of both art and design. We work hand in hand with the quest design team to build the environmental stories that support the content that defines Azeroth’s lands, cultures, and conflicts.<br />
<br />
We also work every step of the way with all of the art groups on the Warcraft team. Working with the environment art team, we sculpt and paint the landscapes to create the rich, vibrant settings that form the foundation of the world. Within those spaces we work with the dungeon team, designing and constructing the thousands of camps, towns, settlements, and cities that provide the unique architectural beauty that anchors all of our cultures and creatures to the world. These locations in turn provide the scenes and staging for the finely crafted set dressing—the tables, chairs, books, and more—that our prop art team creates.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Level design binds the vision of many groups together, and it takes the passionate effort of all these teams to create an incredibly detailed, hand-crafted experience.<br />
<br />
The zones of World of Warcraft are their own main characters that come to life before our very eyes during development. In this series, we’re going to draw back the curtains a bit to show you more on how we approach world-building and how we breathe life into a zone.<br />

I loved colored planets on the TBC outland's skies. But that grey-dead planet over Nagrand is really awesome. Really well-drawn and gigantic. Staying under it gives the feeling you will get attracted to him by gravity *^*</div></div><hr />

So doing that allows one to soar into the skies and see the zones from above? Because I sure haven't been able to get that freedom from setting camera distance to max...<br />
<br />
I shall get my bird's eye view screenshots either way, thanks to the goblin glider and rocket boost malfunctions! ^^<br />

In my experience and since the average age seems to be 25-31 for gamers, I'd dare guess &quot;kids&quot; have very little to do with it. People only seem to grow less patient and more pissy the older they get these days.<br />

Congratulations, you just figured out that WoW has a certain art style. :d<br />
I see no difference from those and the buildings we've had for going on 10 years now, apart from higher graphics.</div></div><hr />

Didn't play the beta so I can't really know. But there might actually be mountains or buildings that allow you to see landscapes from higher up. Or maybe I'm just crazy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
From the size of it in the sky, I would say it's a lot closer than our moon. The reason our moon looks white is because it is 'kinda grey' but far enough and lit enough by the Sun that it appears purer white. Without atmospheric interference and closer proximity, it actually appears closer to grey. <br />
<br />
Regardless though, saying &quot;Even in fantasy&quot; is kind of an...odd statement to make. &quot;Fantasy&quot;, it's called that for a reason, and I might add that different colored moons are well within reasonable levels of 'suspension of disbelief'. It's not like Bliz has ever tried to make WoW super realistic 'simulation-craft'...Nor should they.<br />
<br />
Edit: I thought I might add, colored moons are not even close to being a part of 'suspension of disbelief now that I think about it. 2 things, the materials they're made of and the placement in relation to the atmosphere, are so important in creating what color the moon is perceived as on ground level. In cases of varying distance and placement, moons can appear in any number of colors around a planet. Hell, our own moon can briefly turn into any color of the rainbow with the right eclipses. There are plenty of other moons in the solar system, nay, the whole universe that have varying orbit heights, paths, eclipses, and more. So really, a 'neon green' moon is possible, let alone a normal old grey moon....</div></div><hr />

You might want to consider the light source. The sun is either rising or setting behind that moon. The only thing illuminating the surface is reflected light from draenor. Our moon is so far away that sunlight reflected from earth is too dim to see Moon surfaces that arent receiving direct sunlight. If it were as close as the depicted moon apoears to be, you'd probably be able see a dim gray surface diffused by our atmosphere. Looks like the artist got it spot on IMO.</div></div><hr />

Or maybe the physics from our universe doesn't apply to Azeroth? Alot of stuff seem to point in this direction.....</div></div><hr />

But i've always admired blizzards art development team in WoW. Every new expansion - the zones just get better and better - I applaud you guys for your hard work. Absolutely stunning visuals in WOD on the beta. Don't think their has ever been an expansion with so much detail in every zone. I like how you've made raids &quot;big&quot; in the outside world rather than just an instance portal into a mountain. I literally logged onto the beta and that's what my mate said to me straight away &quot;you have to see the size of highmaul and blackrock foundry&quot; He showed me and i was absolutely stunned. As much as i complain to blizzard a lot about PvP - you guys do an incredible job every new expansion and i hope to see more in future expansions. 10/10 Zones are all amazing, loving all of it.</div></div><hr />

Seems to be how some people are now days, if they can complain, whinge and QQ for no real good reason they will no matter how dumb, stupid and idiotic their whinging, complaining and QQing is they will carry on regardless.. I am not really surprised (heck I have been guilty of it myself but freely admit it) but it is the way things are which is a real pity..<br />

Yeah would be very nice just a shame that you will miss the bulk of the wonderful looking vistas they created by being stuck on the ground and as we all know the flight points are there so one can afk while going to where they want to go.. But hopefully they do implement flying later on will see I spose..</div></div><hr />
