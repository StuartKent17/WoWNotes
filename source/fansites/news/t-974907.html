My gender doesn't matter in the slightest. I'm just a little pony who makes videos. I have literally no idea why people make such a big fuss about this - why would it even matter?<br />

I don't think it changes anything for anyone outside of my 3-4 closest friends I have on realID. =/<br />

Why nerf DK's? We're doing badly in raiding as tanks, Unholy's DPS isn't that great, Frost is fine where it is now. If anything, they should leave the class alone and figure out a way to make Blood Tanks viable in raids.</div></div><hr />

Edit: I thought it was a Yogg+2 solo kill, *shrug*<br />
<br />
Oh this is Mione. The Yogg+2 was a hunter.<br />
<br />
Btw chaud, it's &quot;herself&quot;, not &quot;himself&quot;.<br />
<br />
Mione also has a video of doing +2.<br />
<br />
Also there's videos floating around of Shadow Priests and Hunters soloing Malygos. Wish I was still playing and was good enough to do this stuff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you haven't seen a good blood tank yet then. they are by no means doing bad at all, they are just harder to play then other 3. their mitigation is active, everyone elses is passive. blizz is making dks more faceroll in 4.3 to compensate for this. But our MT is a blood DK, and we're 6/7 heroic and he makes even the block tanks look bad. by far one of the best Dks i've seen. with flawless execution of class, blood can be considerbly OP. Now if you compare the average Dk that doesn't know how to play to the lol paladin that is sitting at 102.4% going &quot;look at me i'm fully CTC and all i gotta do is stand here and put no effort into great mitigation&quot; then you're gonna see a huge diff in surviability. But trust me when i say if the dk has a clue, he can make even a good paladin look bad.</div></div><hr />

Hunters are one of the best solo classes in the game next to DK, so that's not exactly amazing in most cases.<br />

I'd been wanting to try DK for a while now, but everyone kept telling me that Blood was terrible. Well, I finally leveled mine and started taking it somewhat seriously, and I'm finding that it is absolutely awesome to play. I used to think Warrior took more skill, and it actually probably did at one point, but Blood is so much fun to try perfecting. I imagine a very good Blood DK would easily outshine any other kind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now.... bottom line, if your gonna rag on someone that solos a boss then atleast have something to back up your claims with or else your point is VERY moot. so all i have to say is CONGRATULATIONS to those that have solod these bosses i wish i could do things like that :( but being a warrior and a holy priest doesnt help too much lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rime</div><div class="date">2011-09-11, 09:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In what way could that warlock kill be considered 'impressive' ??????You can even see it in the video! He sat still and performed his usual rotation. At one point he used his voidwalker's taunt so that he could catch up on health. At another point he used a healthstone. That's some serious creativity. The dragon phase was obviously trivial, too, because apparently they still scale up with health. You could absolutely not kill that boss at 80 by simply maintaining a 5stack on yourself and then 2-dotting repeatedly.I could solo this on my enh shaman. On my shadow priest. On my ret paladin. On my blood *or* frost dk. Very possibly on my hunter with a tenacity pet. Boomkin, check. Feral tank, check. Probably atonement priest, holy pally and ele shaman though it might take quite a while. So we're left with what....rogues and warriors that can't solo this boss? Definitely front-page worthy then.Remember back when that rogue at 70 got a particular gearset and stacked all sorts of agi and then had 100% avoidance? And he used it to solo gruul? *That* was an impressive solo achievement. Some of the more difficult blood dk feats have been impressive, like the arthas kill. Solo malygos? No.</div></div><hr />

my blood dk is infinitely more geared than my prot pally, yet its infinitely more easy to tank on pally.. really need to fix this. its not even fun to tank as dk anymore since i started playing pally. new changes will help some but imo they should just change mastery to increased parry or something, idk</div></div><hr />

<br />
Where arena teams could lock down my warrior infinitely and burst kill my rogue and enhance shaman and druid Rets and DKs just had Immune spammed above their heads, while dealing HUGE numbers.<br />

You sound like this is all they do in life, and i really really doubt that. i know a good amount of semi pro gamers use their time on sports aswell, and all of them go to school, maybe they dont put as much into it as the top of the class, but isnt that true for 90% of us?<br />
Im pretty sure the only diffrence between those making solo kills, and a good amount of wow players, is that they dont iddle as much in org.</div></div><hr />

Apparently, all the Draenei Warlocks.<br />

OT: Those are moderately impressive kills; now all Mione needs is Alone in the Dark for ultimate massive &quot;NERF DK BLOOD TOO MANY HELLS QQ&quot;. Massive props for that kill.</div></div><hr />

Second, everyone is posting there opinions on the game and such, you calling me out for me posting mine is rather, well stupid.<br />

If you don't care, why are you spending so much time commenting on it? Just ignore it if it bothers you that much, I don't get when people feel the need to complain about stuff like this. Attention seeking much?</div></div><hr />

He also used the wrong &quot;there&quot; instead of &quot;their&quot;. Pretty funny when one person makes 2 grammatical errors, and then corrects someone else. <br />
<br />
Just sayin.</div></div><hr />
