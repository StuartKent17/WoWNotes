&quot;We officially kicked off our inaugural charity event today, and the response has been amazing! In support of the event, Child's Play featured Azeroth United on their events page (http://www.childsplaycharity.org/events.php (http://www.childsplaycharity.org/events.php)), and we are garnering support from WoW-related big-names like Alex Albrect, Scott Johnson and Veronica Belmont. And, all of this response is to bring light to Child's Play Charity, and their amazing efforts to aid those that need to smile the most - patients in Children's Hospitals around the world.<br />
<br />
Together, we developed Hearts, Hands, and Voices to give light not only to Child's Play, but also to foster a sense of community among the millions of World of Warcraft players who are active within the social networking internet media community. Anyone who is part of the MMO community is encouraged to donate their voice, and by doing so we are seeing that our reach extends far beyond our home realm.<br />

Reminder: WoW Battle.net Conversion Coming<br />
If you didn't convert your WoW account to a Battle.net one, you probably can't play WoW anymore at this point. Visit the American Battle.net (http://us.battle.net) or the European Battle.net (http://eu.battle.net) websites to do it now! <br />
A few months ago, we unveiled the Battle.net account, our new way for players to log in to World of Warcraft and future Blizzard games, sign up for upcoming beta tests, shop the online Blizzard Store, and more with just one username and password. This was just the first step in the rollout of the brand-new Battle.net; in the future, players will be able to use Battle.net to participate in cross-realm chat in World of Warcraft, create real-life friends lists, communicate across different games, and a whole lot more.<br />
<br />
In preparation for the launch of these new features, on November 11, 2009, all current World of Warcraft players will be required to merge their World of Warcraft accounts with a Battle.net account in order to log in to the game. As our way to say “thanks” for taking a moment to go through the process, existing World of Warcraft accounts that upgrade to Battle.net (including those that have already switched over) will receive a brand-new penguin in-game pet. Starting on November 11, all World of Warcraft players will need to log in to the game using a Battle.net username and password, and anyone who wishes to create a new World of Warcraft account will need to start with a Battle.net account.<br />
<br />
Creating a Battle.net account is simple and free. To merge your existing account with a Battle.net account, visit http://us.battle.net . For more info, check out the Battle.net site or read the FAQ: http://us.battle.net/faq/index.html<br />

Blue posts<br />
Random Dungeons and Heroic Lockout<br />
It's not that you don't get saved to a Heroic dungeon when using the Random Option in the tool; rather, the Random Option will ignore your Heroic lockouts if you continue to use it, though it will attempt to weight the chance of being randomly selected for a Heroic dungeon to which you've been saved lower than those to which you have not, provided there are enough people in the queue to fill a group for an alternate instance without making you wait an excessive amount of time for a dungeon you have yet to do. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20861002150-enforcing-people-to-do-occulus.html))<br />
<br />
5-Man Dungeons Loot Quality<br />
We tend to provide better loot for forward progression, not the other way around. So you'll see better loot in the three Icecrown Citadel five-player wings (which will include the chance to embark upon the epic quest line to obtain Quel'Delar) given that the dungeon is tuned for higher gear levels than Oculus, just as you see better loot in Trial of the Champion than existing Wrath of the Lich King dungeons today. I'd prefer it if you didn't call it an act of laziness either, as there are plenty of new items with unique art being added in the 3.3 content update.<br />
<br />
In any event, given that Oculus will award Emblems of Triumph in patch 3.3, two Emblems of Frost if it's your first Heroic dungeon of the day run via the Random Dungeon option in the Dungeon system, and two additional Emblems of Triumph if you complete the Heroic dungeon via the Random Dungeon option each time after that, you're technically provided access to better rewards -- and a faster accumulation of emblems -- than you are today. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20861002150-enforcing-people-to-do-occulus.html))<br />
<br />
Oculus difficulty<br />
It's funny. Last week several community managers, developers, encounter designers, and quality assurance folk logged in to the test realms to try out the Dungeon tool by playing in pick-up groups with players via the Random Dungeon option. One of the encounter designers was hit with Oculus first. In jest, we all had a good laugh at the choice provided him for his first go. No one left the group and they cleared it in a flash, I believe getting the 20-minute achievement as well. This was before creatures and bosses were tuned down a bit, and vehicle gear-scaling improved on the test realms.<br />
<br />
It's anecdotal to be sure, but players certainly didn't shy away from enjoying the time running the dungeon with a Blizzard employee; and they had little trouble clearing it. It's one of the faster dungeons in Wrath if done right. Maybe we should implement a system where, every time Oculus is selected for you in the Dungeon tool, a Blizzard employee is put in your group. :p <br />
<br />
[...] This might not fully address your question, but part of the reason the changes were made to Oculus was due to the fact that players were shying away from that dungeon while testing the Dungeon system more often than they were from other dungeons. This is the type of data we're watching on the test realms, particularly when features such as this come along.<br />
<br />
Are the test realm players a typical sample audience? Perhaps not. But in the grand scheme of our World of Warcraft player base, I wouldn't even say those regularly running Heroic dungeons are a good sample audience. This is a large game and people enjoy many different aspects of it, some more so than others. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/20861002150-enforcing-people-to-do-occulus.html))<br />

Vault of Archavon Difficulty<br />
The vault bosses are designed and meant to be very puggable so pretty much anybody can do them (within reason of course). The problem this brings about is what gear they can drop. If we put tokens on them then they are guaranteed loot for everybody in a very easy way - when gear is this easy to get we generally wouldn't want it to be as good. By making it so it's basically a lottery on what drops/what you get we feel we can put some top notch gear on the bosses and it doesn't cause any big issues.

<br />

Weapon Swapping<br />
Let me put it this way....<br />
<br />
Fine: A rogue changes targets so needs to swap weapons to get a different poison on that target. This is more of a strategic thing -- something you only do a few times per fight.<br />
<br />
Not fine: A rogue swaps weapons constantly on the same target in order to get lots of poisons on that target. This is more of a hassle, not an interesting decision the player is making. This is more in line with a caster switching weapons to maximize a proc and then swapping back. It's not fun and it feels like you have to do this annoying and unintuitive (unless you read the forums a lot) trick to maximize your dps.<br />
<br />
Now like someone said above, you could make a weapon swapping mod for say Feral druids and few people would feel the need to use it. It's not the existence of a mod that's a problem. Mods do lots of crazy things. It's a problem if it feels mandatory to raiding rogues. That however is a very subjective call and one that's ultimately up to us to make. We're keeping an eye on it. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21043884738-rogue-weapon-swapping-isnt-a-big-deal.html))<br />
<br />
The solution is very easy (conceptually) - when Deadly Poison procs and a 5-stack is on the target, cause your other hand's poison to proc. This effectively replicates the effect of weapon swapping, works for all specs, and slightly buffs rogue PVE DPS beyond where it's at right now - something which rogues are in dire need of, looking at the parses coming out of 3.3 so far. Additionally, it ensures that raiding rogues will use Deadly Poison, as Blizzard has worked so hard to make it attractive to us.<br />
<br />
We've heard that suggestion a few times and it might be something we explore. We'd certainly rather make swapping not necessary rather than just be mean and prevent it.<br />
<br />
Some of you are posting that rogues will use anything that maximizes their dps and this maximizes their dps. That's not really the point.<br />
<br />
Our original comment on swapping was that it appeared to provide a marginal dps increase and we knew that some rogues who tried it weren't happy with how it worked because the risk was high of screwing something up. So while it theoretically maximized dps, it was risky enough and the gain low enough that we weren't sure it would become mainstream.<br />
<br />
Now things are trending that the dps increase is significant and Adrine's mod is written so well that it takes a lot of the risk away, even in PvP. That weights things more towards doing something about it, though judging from Adrine's posts, I don't think he'll mind. :) (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21043884738-rogue-weapon-swapping-isnt-a-big-deal.html))<br />
<br />
Rogues aren't getting nerfed<br />
Agreed. We're not interested in nerfing rogues here, just making an annoying mechanic less attractive. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21043884738-rogue-weapon-swapping-isnt-a-big-deal.html))<br />

Soulshatter hit chance<br />
As far as we know, Soulshatter always hits. It isn't tied to any other talent, such as Suppression. It would still hit if you had zero +hit on your gear. This was changed at some point after LK launched. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21035173936-warlock-threat-part-2.html))<br />
<br />
Fel Armor healing threat<br />
Fel Armor causes no healing threat in 3.3. This was a relatively recent change though. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/21035173936-warlock-threat-part-2.html))</div></div><hr />

And considering Oculus, being a priest, I just jump down from my drake to the platform and heal with my priest as opposed to the drake as I'm more efficient that way by a large margin even if I manage to die there, I still did 10 times more healing as on that gimped drake. <br />
<br />
I wish Blizzard would stop designing raid bosses where the use of &quot;vehicles&quot; is mandatory, not that it's hard, it's just annoying and boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
who are you talking to?<br />
<br />
i agree with F-minus too.<br />
<br />
lots of people are complaining about the oculus nerf, saying its too easy blah blah.<br />
<br />
like you said vehicle combat is totally irrelavant of your character, so it forces alot of players into doing something they dont like.<br />
<br />
im happy to see the fact gear scales more now. If nothing else it will make it less painful than before.<br />
<br />
its annoying in raids, but i find it a bit different there.<br />
<br />
If its your first time as a paticular vehicle, the raid leader can usually point the person in the right direction and explain what to do.<br />
<br />
in a 5 man heroic pug, its quite rare there is any talking at all, its much more difficult for people who havent used a paticular vehicle to learn their role.<br />
<br />
Also, im fed up of all this 'blizzard gives in to players' crap.<br />
<br />
its a game, they are meant to make it enjoyable for their playerbase. <br />
<br />
If 80% of people complain about a certain thing and say they dont enjoy it, it is a good thing when its changed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tokens from VoA? Screw that. The real problem, which is Blizzard's own doing, is that VoA is currently horribly designed. Consider yourself as a fresh 80. You run some HC Dungeons and you've got yourself some dandy gear. Now, you think, I'd like to try on Archie and get myself some Tier loot! Problem arises: None of the current PuG groups want to take you because they all go for Koralon first. Imagine getting inside nonetheless and surviving the constant crap-talking about your DPS (in the case of a DPS, of course) only to find out that the raid kills Koralon and then everyone leaves because Archie and Emalon don't drop anything useful anymore. Yea. Think about that. Now you're stuck with an impossibility for most newer 80s. My question is, why did Blizzard not make VoA a 3, 4 or 5 door place? Select your foe-type-thing. That way you could find a PuG aiming to kill Archie only, for example.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, just wanted to say this because I am tired of people spamming trade/general/LFG with &quot;link your achievement&quot; when all you want is some sweet iLevel 200/213 loot from Archie.</div></div><hr />

Yea. Think about that. Now you're stuck with an impossibility for most newer 80s. My question is, why did Blizzard not make VoA a 3, 4 or 5 door place? Select your foe-type-thing. That way you could find a PuG aiming to kill Archie only, for example.<br />
<br />
Anyhoo, just wanted to say this because I am tired of people spamming trade/general/LFG with &quot;link your achievement&quot; when all you want is some sweet iLevel 200/213 loot from Archie.<br />
<br />
<br />
Every PuG I've been with always kills all 3, so I don't know if your realm just sucks or that my realm (actually Draenor EU now as my friend xferred me from Silvermoon EU &lt;.&lt;, but it applies to both) just tends to PuG better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Regardless of that, fresh 80's are prevented from going to VoA until they outgear Archavon and quite possibly Emalon as well atm. Not a good design choice in my opinion. And bring on the &quot;but gear is so easy to get anyway why do you need voa?&quot; qq. I'm in the process of leveling and gearing my third character. I found it annoying on my second, and I'm surely going to find this very annoying on this warrior.<br />
<br />
All that aside tho, Murder change ftw! hope it sticks, it has been a bit annoying to have a talent that only works on one out of twenty bosses (obvious exaggeration).<br />
I also like where they're going with the weapon swapping. Especially the &quot;you won't be nerfed, just changed to discourage this behavior&quot; bit. I'm a very happy rogue today.</div></div><hr />

In my opinion, the bosses are pretty damn easy with average gear. Though I did wipe 6 times on the last boss last night because my PUG was terrible (I ended up leaving).<br />
<br />
Occy is annoying because of the drakes. They aggro from really far away, making it difficult to avoid them while moving from area to area. Furthermore, and this is the most annoying, when you have 5 people not mounted, and fighting a boss, and the drake aggros you from the air, essentially wiping most parties when that happens.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm concerned, nerfing the bosses won't change me abandoning that dungeon from the random dungeon LFG.</div></div><hr />

And considering Oculus, being a priest, I just jump down from my drake to the platform and heal with my priest as opposed to the drake as I'm more efficient that way by a large margin even if I manage to die there, I still did 10 times more healing as on that gimped drake. <br />
<br />
I wish Blizzard would stop designing raid bosses where the use of &quot;vehicles&quot; is mandatory, not that it's hard, it's just annoying and boring. <br />

<br />
I do not care for any sort of vehicular combat in this game. People don't like oculus cause the drake controls suck. Malygos 3rd stage sucks, Flame Leviathan sucks and I am sure the IC stuff will be my least favorite part of that raid. Shoehorning in vehicular combat in this game seems to lead to a clunky encounter that has a fun factor of zero. <br />
<br />
Blizzard get a clue. The majority of people I play with don't like that either. Stop putting it in raids. FL was semi interesting the first week and that's it. Having to plow through that on a weekly basis is annoying.</div></div><hr />

Only a few people have to do that stuff and only a few people will be in vehicles. Everyone else will be outside playing their normal characters.

Actually Mr. Dumbass games should offer some kind of challenge and degree of difficulty. By your logic Tetris, the game that sold over 2million original Gameboys, should not exist. Rubics Cubes are hella challenging but yet they continue to sell and some individuals have been working on them for years and some get in in under a minute.

<br />
Eddie Carrington (aka Brigwyn) here.<br />
<br />
As many others have already done, I just wanted to stop by and express my gratitude to Boubouille for helping us out and announcing the Azeroth United's Hearts, Hands and Voices Child's Play charity drive.<br />
<br />
Also, I'd like to express my gratitude to everyone that has donated so far. Your generosity is amazing and at this rate, we'll have reached and blown past our original goal of $5,000. Again, please accept all of our gratitude for helping with achieving that.<br />
<br />
I had also read some questions in previous threads. Some were addressed in the original post but others might have gotten lost in the shuffle.<br />
<br />
As a thank you for your support SwagDog.com has given us (Azeroth United) some 25% off discount codes to share with everyone that helps or participates. I'll be sending these to Bobouille so he can distribute since I'm not entirely sure of the rules here for that kind of thing.<br />
<br />
Someone had asked about getting pets if they donate? No, we're not giving pets away. We do have some special thank you gifts that you could qualify to win depending on the size of your donation. The details were listed in the original post. Simply put, a $10 donation qualifies for the Heart or Tier 1, and $20 qualifies for Tier 2.<br />
<br />
Finally, I believe it was Tomhvk that had stated some concerns over the donations and statements that Fimlys had made ealier about how the donations go directly to the charity.<br />
<br />
This is a 100% accurate statement. We are recognized by Child's Play as an Official charity event. You can find the Azeroth United Hearts, Hands and Voices charity drive listed on the Official Child's Play Charity Event's page (http://www.childsplaycharity.org/events.php).<br />
<br />
This means that all donations can taken off as US IRS Tax Deductions and we can work with Child's Play to make sure you get a receipt.<br />
<br />
As for the the openness of the operations of Child's Play, Kristin Lindsay (Project Manager in charge of Child's Play) is very proud of the fact and has made it public record that they operate in with less than 5% overhead.<br />
<br />
I know I have probably violated numerous rules here, and for that I apologize, but I just wanted to help clarify some of the concerns I saw stated and at the same time express my and the entire Azeroth United Team's appreciation and gratitude for your support.<br />
<br />
Thank you.</div></div><hr />

Tokens from VoA? Screw that. The real problem, which is Blizzard's own doing, is that VoA is currently horribly designed. Consider yourself as a fresh 80. You run some HC Dungeons and you've got yourself some dandy gear. Now, you think, I'd like to try on Archie and get myself some Tier loot! Problem arises: None of the current PuG groups want to take you because they all go for Koralon first. Imagine getting inside nonetheless and surviving the constant crap-talking about your DPS (in the case of a DPS, of course) only to find out that the raid kills Koralon and then everyone leaves because Archie and Emalon don't drop anything useful anymore. Yea. Think about that. Now you're stuck with an impossibility for most newer 80s. My question is, why did Blizzard not make VoA a 3, 4 or 5 door place? Select your foe-type-thing.

Tetris wasn't hard, Cubes aren't hard. Challenge and difficulty are fine, yes. But if you look at the stats, around 2% of guilds IN THE WORLD have beat Anub heroic. And how long has ToC been out now? I mean come on, don't you think that number is a bit low? It's like Yogg before the nerf, I remember being in a good guild on my old server, and we would wipe for like 20+ hours a week on just that (just on the wiping after we facerolled everything up to him). Back when only 1% of guilds IN THE WORLD had actually beat him.<br />
<br />
But you said &quot;baddies&quot;, so I really think that it's pointless to argue with you. Good day sir. And it's &quot;Miss Dumbass&quot;, thank you.</div></div><hr />

Finding a group willing to carry you (or most likely in your case going in with your guild) is far different than someone who doesn't have the benefit of a progressed guild willing to carry alts to gear them up or in some cases a main.</div></div><hr />

They aren't even &quot;big names&quot; in World of Warcraft, like it says;<br />
Veronica Belmont and Alex Albrecht are Rev3 alumni, Scott Johnson is a comic artist. Alex may host Project Lore, but it's on hiatus.<br />
<br />
Anyways, Oculus sucked. I have been trying to pug it on the PTR to see how hard is was nerfed, but one person always declines.<br />
Good way to find a group, really. Join LFG then decline when a group is actually found.<br />
I want to go in there on a lower ilvl character and see if it doesn't suck as much as it did at launch.</div></div><hr />

Due to the overwhelming response we were forced to switch hosts. Here's hoping that DNS will resolve soon.<br />

This is the type of data we're watching on the test realms, particularly when features such as this come along.<br />
<br />
some other guys hitted the point: vehicles-use is funny and can offer a nice game experience, but... i think it s unfair for boss fights. and here vehicle-use is not a phase of the fight, it is the whole fight. <br />
in tbc, remember how it s been hard for me (and not only for me) learn to control ghosts in teron gorefiend encounter.<br />
but, it was end content raid, it was a part of a more complex fight, not the whole fight. and a real masterpiece-boss.<br />
i think you lost the right sense of measure in oculus. my oculus? broken long time ago:)<br />
i m a startrek fun: when we can use enterprise-vehicle (it will scale with my sense of humor)?<br />
<br />
<br />
Are the test realm players a typical sample audience? Perhaps not.<br />
<br />
lol. i tempted to copy some fresh lvl 80 and bring there. for offering some genuine wipe experience.<br />

<br />
What crack, Blizzard, are you on? Rogues dominate DPS in every raid I'm in, if a Rogue or Arcane mage isn't #1 in Ulduar gear then someone is in ToGC 25 gear.<br />
<br />
Jesus, in dire need of, how about that buff to BM Hunters? Worst performing spec needs to have that &quot;everyone should be viable&quot; mumbo jumbo applied.</div></div><hr />
