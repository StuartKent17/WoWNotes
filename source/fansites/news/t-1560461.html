Comic-Con visitors got another teaser for the Warcraft movie this year, but no footage has appeared as of yet. For now we have a short description thanks to comingsoon (http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=121083), SlashFilm (http://www.slashfilm.com/warcraft-teaser-trailer-comic-con-2014/), ScreenRant (http://screenrant.com/warcraft-movie-trailer-sdcc-2014/), IGN (http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/26/sdcc-2014-duncan-jones-gives-fans-their-first-look-at-warcraft), and io9 (io9):<br />
<br />
<br />
The movie focuses on the origin of conflict between Humans and Orcs in Azeroth.<br />
The story should be accessible to everyone, not just Warcraft fans.<br />
A human (Travis Fimmell (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1379938/)) wearing Alliance themed armor is up first. He wonders if he is a fool for spending so much time protecting his king and so little protecting his son.<br />
An orc was up next, noting that he had led thousands of warriors into battle but fears becoming a father, wondering if that makes him a leader or a coward.<br />
A giant throne, armory, green sky, gryphon, and other Warcraft elements appear in the teaser.<br />
Magic and melee fighting occur between the Orcs and Humans. Ben Foster (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004936/) appears as Medivh.<br />
SlashFilm (http://www.slashfilm.com/warcraft-teaser-trailer-comic-con-2014/) mentioned the Orcs are already Lord of the Rings quality, but ScreenRant (http://screenrant.com/warcraft-movie-trailer-sdcc-2014/) mentions that they look far from finished. <br />
Everyone seems to agree that the scenery looks great!<br />

Ah yes! Get Orlando Bloom on the phone!<br />

I'm kidding, I'm kidding!<br />

But yeah, I did forget the high elves would be possibly seen in the first one. Depends on how much they focus on the initial invasion and sacking of Stormwind versus beyond that. But I'm sure there will be a high elf or two.</div></div><hr />

I disagree with that. There is a chance. The production team are competent enough, maybe not massive names but have a decent track record.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying it will be good, but there is a chance. If it had been given to Uwe Boll or some other twat, then I'd agree with you.</div></div><hr />

That's not a bad thing. A movie like this should work as a standalone story, you shouldn't need prior knowledge to watch it.</div></div><hr />

Well, no Tauren and Night Elves, but there will probably be Dwarves, Gnomes, Humans, High Elves for the Alliance and Orcs, Ogres, Goblins, Trolls for the Horde. Well it depends, but those were the Original Factions before Warcraft 3.</div></div><hr />

This.<br />

An adaptation of anything should always cater to those with no prior knowledge. Adaptations should always stand alone. If you need knowledge of the source material to understand it, it's a fucking shitty adaptation.</div></div><hr />

probably high elves, and there could be trolls. but no tauren i expect as they are only on Kalimdor, same as night elves. there are trolls on EK in this time period, but i don't think they will appear in the movie, don't remember them playing any role in the original humans vs orcs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why is footage of this movie so super secret?<br />
<br />
Comic Con has really strict rules on this kind of stuff, and usually they're really good <br />
at keeping people from filming things.<br />
<br />
As to the over all movie, I dunno. Perhaps Jones doesn't want people whining about <br />
every little change, or perhaps he just wants it all to come out at once and be a huge <br />
surprise.</div></div><hr />

Stop imagining little slights like this. Comic Con always works like this. The only way you would get a video of the teaser is if some brave nerd got his phone out and recorded it on his shitty phone camera.</div></div><hr />

Because the original logo is quite cartoonish and the mainstream audience wouldn't take it seriously?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I do think the logo is a bit generic but the old logo would give the appearance of a Harry Potter type vibe.

I hope to god that they have some good screen writer and NO ONE from Blizzard is allowed to alter their scripts. WoW story lines and character developments are so corny and lame.<br />
The Hobbit has got to be the cheesiest story line and character development I've ever read when I was a little kid (even worse than Warcraft has, yet it still turn out to be one of the best movies I've ever saw. and I am almost 20 years older now than when I first read the book.<br />
<br />
<br />
Because is has to appeal to so many you can bet your ass everything you already know will be explained as if it was getting told to a child. <br />
I doubt it. LotR and The Hobbit turned out great without any spoon-feeding.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wonder why people keep thinking it's a WOW movie...<br />
<br />
I am keeping my hopes on the down low, but if this movie becomes a success, we could have a LOTR series of movies on our hands.<br />
I wouldn't. They are aiming for LotR/Hobbit quality with even higher budget ($100 mil) and if the first movie is gonna be a hit, they will do a trilogy at least.<br />
<br />
<br />

I get that. I just don't get the warcraft vibe at all from the logo, which is the only thing (including a few concepts) I have seen. I think they could make the old logo more gritty if they really wanted to, some darker orange colour, maybe some sort of bronze, but well.

It'd be disingenuous to release widespread teasers this far ahead of the release.<br />

hair and a beard and is garbed in black shining armor trimmed with gold. Pretty snazzy.<br />
<br />
<br />
We then see a slew of quick shots of the supporting cast, including a nefarious-looking <br />
Dominic Cooper, Ben Foster's mage casting a spell, and a green-skinned Paula Patton <br />
aggressively licking someone. Eat your heart out, Robin Thicke.<br />
<br />
The orcs look great, very organic and real. The world also looks real and not simply like a <br />
CG-rendered realm. We get a sense of the different regions, from the desert wastelands <br />
to the wooded regions of the humans.<br />
<br />

As far as video game movies go, Warcraft certainly looks like the most ambitious and -- yes, <br />
I'll stick my neck out here -- the video game movie that may finally be an actual great movie.<br />

Given the description provided here and on Io.com, it would make sense since it's being setup as an origin story between Orcs and Humans and what better way (only way?) than to focus on the First War.</div></div><hr />

I think the Warcraft logo looks more &quot;cartoonish&quot; than the LOTRO logo. There's not much in it, and I agree that the film's logo is quite generic, but I think there is a distinction. The Warcraft logo looks dated. Hell, even the LOTRO logo is looking dated these days.<br />
<br />
<br />
There we go, now we'll be getting your standard &quot;Orcs be evul, Humans be gud&quot; story otherwise your average movie go-er might get a headache<br />
<br />
That's not entirely true. If the film does turn out that way it will be sad, but there is a subtle difference between making it accessible and dumbing down the story to a simplistic black and white morality tale. I'm not going to say absolutely that the film will draw things in shades of grey as it's far too early to call. But there have been at least a few &quot;blockbuster&quot; films that dare to show moral ambiguity, and I'm hoping, reservedly, that the Warcraft film follows those lines.</div></div><hr />

<br />
One thing for sure, movie is delayed due to Star Wars releasing on the date they wanted to release, and they will have 2 blizzcon to hype it even more. This movie if done well has potential to do a series, and that would be interesting since there is a lot of lore to be seen.<br />
<br />
And somebody asked, so.. Chris Metzen was involved in the scenario.<br />
<br />
Now I find funny we will have WOD soon with Durotan in it and the movie is about him too, the movie will be released probably around the next expansion after WOD will be revealed, so that is most likely bad timing due to postponing the launch.<br />
<br />
My only issue is is.. hyping on a movie 18 months before its release, I have fear it's way ahead of when they should do that.</div></div><hr />

It's likely going to show demons, ogres, orcs as well as all the races present on Eastern Kingdoms (minus Undeads as they didn't exist back then).

Most people like me can't care less about the start of the Orc and Human conflict. We want to see Jaina and others! I got a feeling that this Warlord Expack is tied in with the movie. They had to find a way to bring back this old characters.<br />
<br />
No because the movie will hit near the end of Warlords.</div></div><hr />

It's a bit like how both The Hobbit and LOTR trilogies actually take place over a much greater compressed timespan than the books, even beyond cutting out a lot of the travel.</div></div><hr />

But yeah, I did forget the high elves would be possibly seen in the first one. Depends on how much they focus on the initial invasion and sacking of Stormwind versus beyond that. But I'm sure there will be a high elf or two.<br />

That's why it's in production, fantasy is hot right now.<br />

It's just a fantasy film with elements from the Warcraft Universe, rather than being &quot;THE Warcraft Film&quot;, wait and see.</div></div><hr />

Night elves weren't introduced until Warcraft III. They're still a long ways off, assuming we don't get flashbacks explaining some of the history of Azeroth.<br />

Anduin Lothar, Durotan, Medivh, Garona, King Llane Wrynn, bulky armor, giant weapons, gryphons, lightning bolts, the Dark Portal, Draenor, Azeroth -- doesn't sound like Warcraft to you? Are you nuts?</div></div><hr />

How can people be surprised that there might be family drama in a Warcraft movie considering the amount of family issues that show up in lore? Hell ,we have atleast two guys murdering their fathers with Arthas Menethil and Renault Mograine.

<br />
That's Comic-Con. They have very strict rules and a bunch of people that are watching the audience and if they see someone film stuff with their phone they will stop immediately what they were doing, pack up their things and go. It already happened in the past when someone took a photo from a powerpoint slide and nobody got to see the trailer they wanted to show.<br />
<br />
It's a very high risk and when you're caught everybody looses. Fans and official media and magazines. People that attend Comic-Con are very dedicated and will play by the rules.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well they won't be in the movie so I wouldn't worry. Thrall isn't even born yet, and Grom did nothing but sit behind on Draenor chilling until the WC2 Expansion's setting.<br />
<br />
And we have no idea how the main guys in this movie apart from Medivh sound so eh. I really hope they stay faithful to the lore here. I'm wanting to see some Turalyon, Lothar, Terenas, Garona, Gul'dan etc all played out. I also hope we see some of the scenes from The Last Guardian played out in the movie. I think a movie setting all on The Last Guardian would be just plain epic itself.</div></div><hr />

The First War. From what we know, it sounds like it will start shortly after the orcs <br />

I'm not sure exactly how this constitutes 'family drama'. It's called inner turmoil. It's just one tool used to explore a character, especially a character embroiled in conflict. It has nothing to do with 'family drama', least of all the kind you'd find in Full House. <br />

<br />
Seriously, it looks like Orc's in Space the Cartoon Series.<br />
<br />
If they want to change the logo at least make it look serous and real. This looks like the start of a bad cartoon on public cable. They must of spent an entire $10 on the software to make this logo at Best Buy. They walked in saw the software 'Logo maker' and though hell ya! <br />
<br />
Absolutely hideous logo, legendary should be ashamed of themselves.<br />
<br />
And the animation is poor to say the best of it. I'm sorry a little bit of burning then spontaneous combustion with the most generic burnout ever? Really?<br />
<br />
Seriously the more I watch the logo the more terrible it gets.<br />
<br />
Why does the logo start off burning? Shouldn't it come in as the metal logo, then slow start to burn away?<br />
<br />
Also, look at the &quot;C&quot; when it fades in it the bottom have is burned, but then magically the burning porition of transforms the burnt part to the metal part, just to have it all burn away? Really, if this little detail is paid in something as simple as the logo, I'd hate to see what the actual import parts are going to look like. They can't even do the burnout of the logo correctly. <br />
<br />
Blizzard put an end to this maddness, force Legendary to use the Warcraft logo. They can make it shiny so people don't think it is cartoony, the logo and font is fine, but for the love of god get rid of this trash logo legendary has made.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Director: duncan jones, we all know his credibility in the industry i'm assuming<br />
Cinematographer: Simon Duggan, i will admit his body of work is not that impressive. I, Robot, 300: RoE, and Great Gatsby.<br />
Editor: Paul Hirsch, this dude has an oscar for his editing. he worked on the original SW trilogy and MI movies<br />
Casting directors: Lindsay Grahem and Mary Vernieu: they did casting for movies like; SLP, black swan, Looper, Sin City<br />
VFX company they are using produced for movies like CA: Winter soldier, hunger games movies, X-men DoFP<br />
the SFX supervisor has won two oscars for Life of Pi and Golden Compass, so the CGI will be oscar caliber.<br />
Pre-production budget of 100+mil. post production and completion of film and ad campaign will prolly set the movie to about 150mil+ budget.<br />
<br />
The actors involved are all up and coming stars or veteran respected actors within hollywood, unless you all wanted big names.<br />
<br />
how is a movie with this much caliber and production can be compared to the likes of older VG movie adaptations or a quick money grab. <br />
<br />
The reason why the shooting of the film is relatively short was because the premise of the film is a two sided story from both the horde and alliance PoV through Lothar and Durotan's PoV. The horde PoV is already confirmed to be motion captured (planet of the apes, gollum, smaug style for those who don't know). Pretty much half of the movie will be motion capture which is why post production is 20 months long because mo-cap is usually done during post production.<br />
<br />
Even with all this said this movie can still suck, but it won't be for stupid reasons like the logo, not enough effort is put into it, no passion, money grab, low budget shitfest. If this movie suck it will be because of things like script, storytelling, pace, tone, and other shit that really affect the outcome of a movie.</div></div><hr />

If yoou look at youtube, the marvel panel has been uploaded completely. its like a 34 min video. Why dont they upload all of the panel? Even if the argument was &quot;only the big time important stuff&quot; then Legendary would still count. Is it some weird thing to keep everyone from seeing anything at all about this movie? Seems so weird to me.</div></div><hr />

I think much more info and shit will be talked about at BC 2014 and maybe even some of the majore characters like Ben Foster, Travis Fimmel, and Dominic Cooper might attend.<br />
SDCC 2015 will definitely have a full blown 45min Warcraft panel no doubt, and BC 2015 will prolly have a full length 2:30 min trailer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fuck you, Travis Fimmel is a fucking BEAST.<br />
<br />
Sorry, no. If that guys is indeed playing Lothar I think I'll rage.<br />
<br />
Lothar is described as a balding huge bulking man who towers over everyone. This guy is nothing like that. Plus he's simply too young. This dude isn't Lothar.<br />
<br />
The guy they got playing Medivh could work though. <br />
<br />
I don't think this movie is going to get good reviews no matter what though. People will hear it's a video game based movie and shit all over it from then on based on that statement =\</div></div><hr />
