Clarity of Purpose isn't THAT big, being only a .05 sec nerf (But lol at requires shadowform). The change that's really big is the Speed of Light.<br />
<br />
It went from:<br />
<br />
&quot;Casting Holy Shock grants 10/20/30% spell haste for your next Flash of Light, Holy Light or Divine Light, and casting Holy Radiance grants you 20/40/60% movement speed for 4 sec. Also lowers the cooldown on Holy Radiance by 10/20/30 sec at all times.&quot;<br />
<br />
to:<br />
<br />
&quot;Grants 1/2/3% spell haste and reduces the cooldown of Holy Radiance by 30 sec. Casting Holy Radiance increases your movement speed by 20/40/60% for 4 sec.&quot;<br />
<br />
They basically gave us a 3% passive spell haste instead of (The much better, I think) 30% spell haste every 6 seconds for your most used heals.<br />
<br />
And they said they didn't want boring talents. =_=;;</div></div><hr />

I think this build is a merge of the live 4.0.1 changes, last build skip and more changes. Remember they don't update beta a long time ago and they update ptr 3 times. We need that changes and the new ones they made. <br />
Just hope this means they did a lot of changes and fix a lot of anoying buggs on quest and heroics last few weeks.</div></div><hr />

The way MMO Champ works (I think) is that he compares each patch's files to the file before and updates from there. So these are changes in addition to the patch that won't make it to beta, not replacing them.</div></div><hr />

I even made my own feat for it!<br />

Yes you are. What's with the description? Feels like they're spitting in my face. Morons, all of them. I didn't go through all the trouble for a lousy, useless Feat of Strength. I refuse to turn my scepter in for that, so I'll simply do nothing and wait until they bring it back, which they won't considering they're giant assholes.</div></div><hr />

Their high burst single target heals and awesome aoe heals and lightning fast haste was too much for the other healing classes. They needed to lose that 27% haste for their most used bomb heal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Icy touch was good to begin threat with now u got nothing cause its downed from an avarege of 20k tps a Cast to 6k threat each cast. Now u need to keep ur tps at 35k using runestrike but it works when u dodge or parry. Cant do that many on some bosses and i got 28%dodge with new talents spec. SO bring back my Icy touch to start building threat:) 9%stam i like 60k + unbuffed hp <br />
