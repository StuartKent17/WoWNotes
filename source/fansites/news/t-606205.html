<br />
Hotfixes applied and active:<br />
Players are no longer able to accept the quests &quot;Blood for Blood&quot; and &quot;Blast the Gateway&quot; without first completing &quot;The Missing Magistrix&quot;<br />
Felblood Initiate respawn rate significantly increased<br />
Veneratus the Many now spawns correctly<br />
The Horde Spirit Healers in Alterac Valley will once again teleport Horde players to a different graveyard if the current once gets captured by Alliance<br />
Archmages’s Guile, Battle Mace of the High Priestess, Terrok’s Gavel, and Sedai’s Blade have all been properly changed to Main-Hand Only weapons<br />
When taking the flight path from Ironforge to the Isle of Quel'Danas, you will no longer become fatigued and die if you had any buffs active which affect your ability to breathe underwater<br />
Looting Bind on Pickup items now properly brings up the confirmation dialog while using the Round Robin looting method<br />
Reliquary of Souls, Prince Kael'thas, and other bosses now properly cast their spells<br />
The time before players with flags in Warsong Gulch receive the Focused Assault and Brutal Assault debuffs has been reduced<br />
The timer for Focused Assault and Brutal Assault in Warsong Gulch will now reset whenever both Flags are returned to their bases <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Sunwell Isle Progression<br />
We already knew that small servers would get an automatic completion of the event at some point, now Drysc confirms that there is nothing in place to slow down the bigger servers even if the 2nd phase seems to take more time than the first one. <br />
Each phase, and the subsequent &quot;add ons&quot; for each phase (anvil, alchemy table, etc.) require a set number of turn ins of the specific quests that fund them. There's no mechanic that increases that number. So no, a realm with a higher population is not handicapped.<br />
<br />
There is however a mechanic that will auto-complete each phase after a set amount of time for those realms that aren't able to complete them within a &quot;decent&quot; amount of time.<br />
<br />
What you may be seeing is a general cool down of people taking part in those quests? I can't really say why your realm may be seeing a slower progression aside from them just not completing as many quests as another realm.<br />
<br />
Once the Armory is taken over you can begin building the Anvil, once the Anvil is complete the new badge vendor becomes available. (Source (http://forums.worldofwarcraft.com/thread.html?topicId=5591020881&amp;postId=55906090388&amp;sid=1#29))<br />
That's a good opportunity to talk about gorgonnash.info (http://www.gorgonnash.info/), this site gather the progression of the offensive on all servers through an addon and ranks them. You can also see the details of the progression on a specific server (http://us.gorgonnash.info/realm/Cenarius). Both European (http://www.gorgonnash.info/) and American (http://us.gorgonnash.info/) versions are available.<br />

PvPScene - Proximo 2 Review<br />
Yes, PvPScene (http://www.pvpscene.com/) is still alive ! I know a lot of players have been busy with their addons because of the release of the patch, and Chaud decided it would be a good time to post a review of what's in Proximo 2 (http://www.pvpscene.com/index.php?topic=1784.0)<br />

Not sure if its a bug, but I don't think so, since it allowed me to do something I've never been able to before... pick pocket a blue gem. I was in Magister's Terrace, and picked up a Talasite off one of the mobs in the first bosses room. Also, it seems the change from several patches ago that took green items our of junk-boxes has been revereted, as that same rum my guild mate got a green neck out of a junk box.</div></div><hr />

Tauren 2 Handed weapons, Female human and Male Dwarf 1 handed weapons are all intended changes. As I have said before If you do not like it please post in the general or suggestions forum. Posting here will do you no good.<br />
<br />
Undead and Troll weapons are bugs and will be fixed in a future patch.</div></div><hr />
