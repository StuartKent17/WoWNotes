<br />
Kill Gordon MacKellar (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/130828-gordon-mackellar) in Stormwind or Charles Gastly (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/130911-charles-gastly) in Orgrimmar for a chance at getting the toy. The respawn time is roughly 6 minutes and there are often groups, as the tagging of the NPC can be shared.<br />

<br />
That's astonishing. They openly nerfed Shadow Priests because they were reaching Afflock's level in council fights one week after Antorus patch, removing all hopes of any sort of utility in MM+ dungeons, but they still allow this nonsense.<br />
I just can't understand the decision making when it comes to balance classes.<br />
<br />
The boost is nice. Still wondering if I use it on the only remaining class I don't have (Warrior) at least for the Class Campaign FoS, or if I keep it for instant Allied Race...<br />
The fact that you're skipping the Artifact intro quest sucks, though. Some of them are really interesting and you'll never experience it unless you grind all your way to lvl 110.</div></div><hr />

More to do with the fact 32 bit and DX9 support is gone in BFA and the previous cards would run the DX11 client like garbage.<br />
<br />
And you can still go and get a 750 ti cheap and it will run it decently. Just because it's been removed from recommended doesn't mean it won't run it well anymore.</div></div><hr />

It's still weird that they would recommend an i7 for a game which is hardly optimized to take advantage of a quad core let alone a quad core with hyper-threading along with dumping the 6300 entirely. The extra frequency, sure, but then why not just say (in the case of Intel) an i5-4690 which has a higher base frequency and similar turbo?<br />
<br />
It'd make sense if they optimized the engine to not be garbage when it comes to threading but I haven't heard any such comments.</div></div><hr />

Maybe they are doing it internally for post launch or when DX12 is ready? Who knows really. Maybe they will have more freedom to optimize it with DX9/32 bit gone?<br />
<br />
But yeah I do find it odd that they are recommending an I7.</div></div><hr />

I just saw a wccftech article saying that there could very well be DX12 optimization since a GXAPI_D2D12 string has been datamined but at the same time wccftech isn't exactly a bastion of trust so it'll be interesting to see how this unfolds in regards to performance if it turns out to be true.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The string wouldn't be there if they had no intention.<br />
<br />
It'll probably be tested on Alpha/Beta or later on post launch like 11 was in Cata and then fully implemented.</div></div><hr />

Only the so-called &quot;veteran&quot; boost boots you main professions. You need to be character level 60+ with two active primary professions for that, and it's sufficient that these are just skill level 1.<br />

The artifact weapon you get depends on your active spec at boost time. The story is not removed, you can pick it up at your class hall later.</div></div><hr />

The engine of WoW is heavily modified and over 15 years old, i think one of the biggest problems is that it has no good multi-core usage like most other games have now (or 5 years ago) so it is heavily reliant on cpu usage.<br />
<br />
however i also think blizzard should invest more time in graphical resource optimization, i got a good i5 and 1060 with 16 gb ram and don't always have stable 60 fps in dalaran and suramar on higher, not maxed out!, settings.<br />
<br />

The core usage is the main problem right now, working with only one core, means it needs a lot more MHz to do what a recent games do with a good multicore optimization. And this is going to get worst with time, and I dont know if Dx12 will help at all.<br />

It goes to the 'default' spec for the class. For Paladin, that's Retribution. For Hunters, it's Beast Mastery. Generally, it will be the easiest or simplest DPS spec that gets picked if you boost before your toon is level 10.</div></div><hr />

Probably an oversight due to the intro quest from Dal that leads you into Suramar. That flight path used to be phased until completing that quest, but they changed that fairly early on.</div></div><hr />

Crypto currency is mined using computers which complete a complex string of equations kind of like a digital lottery of sorts that nets you with a digital currency effectively turning time into money. It is more complex than that but that is how I understand it. However GPU's are the best thing we know of so far for farming them and you have tons of non gaming people buying higher end cards and it is inflating the price for people who want them for gaming or other applications like graphics related work. Just sucks to be a pc gamer right now.</div></div><hr />

Trolls and Dark Iron won't be unlocked at the start of BfA - it's speculation that it'll mostly likely occur on the first content patch. The associated story needs to 'unfold' prior to the unlocking (rep etc).

I was a bit surprised by the I7 recommendation. The only differences between an I-5 and an I-7 are I-7 has hyper threading and a larger L3 cache. There are maybe just a handful of games that support hyper threading and WoW isn't one of them. I-5's generally handle games better due to handling threads more efficiently. I-7's are geared more like heavy processing like Video Editing Graphical Design and CAD. In Gaming I-5 will do just as well but in saying that get the I-5 with the best performance for the buck. You are better off spending the 100 bucks more that an I-7 cost on either an SSD Video Card or Ram. <br />
<br />
<br />
Personally I use an I-5 6500 Skylake GTX1070 32GB of Ram and a 256 SSD I don't have any issues running WoW. In my Other machine I run a Xeon with similar specs they run almost identical. I've ran WoW with the Pentium dual core based on the Skylake Chip it ran WoW fine as well. Unless there are drastic changes in BoA I still feel an I-7 is a bit Over Kill.</div></div><hr />

yes as a linux user the prospect of using directx11 under wine (which is far slower than directx9) is alarming. opengl is dead afaik, dx9 will be gone. there will be only dx11 for us. vulkan would be nice.<br />

The spec sheet is just to modernize the hardware list a little (no one knows what a C2D is anymore) and to imply there will be more stupid CPU bound areas like Suramar that no PC on Earth can run properly. Ie; be ready to brute force 3-4 frames of difference across 8 generations of CPUs. Also keep in mind the Intel shit and that old Intel CPUs got hit harder than anything from the past 3-4 years.<br />
<br />
I don't know what that DX12 stuff is about but trust me on this one: do not get your hopes up. The idea of them going for a full DX12 implementation on a 14 year old MMO is, at best, up there with the odds of winning the lottery.

I dunno. Unless the sharding tech is on point, I'd imagine the new zones will be quite congested, which will make the kill x mob quests unbearable. I usually wait a day or two before I start leveling my main during a new expansion, anyway.</div></div><hr />

Coming from someone who has played it since launch. While I like bdo a lot despite all that and the fact pearl abyss doesn't understand the concept of class balance or the massive p2w issues. BDO's engine and servers are garbage and will never be fixed.<br />
There is a lot to love in bdo, there is also a lot more to hate.<br />
