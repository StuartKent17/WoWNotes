Terms of Service Violations in Antorus<br />
As you’ve seen over the course of Legion, we’ve been consistently increasing our actions taken against Terms of Service violations used to give an unfair advantage in raid and dungeon content. These violations include selling raid clears for real money, sharing accounts between members of the same raid team, and similar behaviors prohibited under the ToS. <br />
<br />
With Mythic Antorus about to open and the world first race ready to begin, we felt it was important to give a reminder of our stance on these issues, as well as a warning that we will be actively monitoring and taking action against those who participate in such behavior to gain an early progression advantage in Mythic Antorus.<br />
<br />
We’re excited to see how our top players progress through Mythic Antorus in the weeks to come, and want to ensure that the experience is as fair as possible for everyone participating. Please keep this in mind as you begin to work your way through the Burning Throne, and best of luck!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Applying the raw 4% buff naively to the current SimCraft numbers, it makes Outlaw (on average) the 3rd highest DPS melee spec (and ~7th highest DPS spec overall) at 960 ilvl w/ t21, well ahead of the other rogue specs, but still behind Sub (DfA) at 930 t20 (on average). But with the added bonus of being by far the most inconsistent spec in the game right now (at both item levels, but especially at lower item levels w/ t20)...<br />
<br />
Given that huge inconsistency, and Sub's much higher playtime since Legion's launch, I'm interested to see what effect this actually has at all. It doesn't seem like it makes Outlaw all that more appealing (especially for progression)... But I'd expect to see high parses once content is on farm...<br />
<br />
Obviously SimCraft numbers are not nearly a 100% reflection of actual in-game performance, just doing a incredibly quick and incredibly naive comparison to what's currently on live...<br />
<br />
I often wonder... With changes like this... What the goal is? Seems rather purposeless, to be honest...<br />
<br />
Will this actually affect the number of rogues raiding as Outlaw? I kind of doubt it.</div></div><hr />

Isn't that a good place for a buff to be? It brings up an under performing spec, but doesn't change the meta or make people feel forced to switch for the cutting edge? I agree the aura buffs are a bit lazy, but I think that is a good place for a buff to be... or I am I totally off my rocker (which is possible), but just genuinely curious.</div></div><hr />

It's not, though. You can trade money for gold via tokens, but you CANNOT trade gold for money - at best, you can trade it for Blizzard account balance, which is different from money in that you can't spend it on whatever you want. And that's a very, very crucial difference.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I honestly don't know.<br />
<br />
The competitive, numbers-obsessed player in me thinks that Blizzard should be making changes with the knowledge that a lot of players care a lot about how well they perform in a competitive raid environment, even if they are not at the cutting edge. And those that don't care aren't going to care whether they buff Outlaw 4% or not (they were probably already playing Outlaw anyway)...<br />
<br />
So, if you have two camps (which I honestly think is a relatively realistic abstraction), one that cares about performing as well as their class can and one that plays the spec they enjoy (or find playable/easy to play), this change doesn't really affect either group. So, I guess the question just becomes does 4% make a raid that has a few Outlaw rogues in it capable of clearing content they were unable to before... I think the answer to that question is also no... Outlaw wasn't the worse spec (in fact it was the best scaling rogue spec to being with)... So, why are Ret Pallys or Feral Druids or DKs not getting buffs for the same reason? To make raids that bring a few better equipped to actually clear content?<br />
<br />
I just don't understand how Blizzard makes these decisions. It just seems pointless...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Tath's perfect, but they should have nerfed it in Tos, when the spec was waaaaaaaaaaay overtuned, with set bonuses waaaaaaaaay overtuned, with numbers waaaaaaaaaay overtuned, with a 4th gold trait waaaaaaaay overtuned and 10 times more powerfull than every other 4th in the whole game, and of course, the legendary helmet who was designed to be a hidden 6p bonuse to the T20.<br />
<br />
Now, Blizzard is officialy signing the dead of the Legion arms spec, the worst designed ever (with the excessive buffs in 7.2.5, the T20 bonuses, the 4th golden, the legendary, the spec took a 100% up in a turnmoil, because the dev' are clueless about how to work correctly).</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ravity</div><div class="date">2017-12-05, 01:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Isn't that a good place for a buff to be? It brings up an under performing spec, but doesn't change the meta or make people feel forced to switch for the cutting edge? I agree the aura buffs are a bit lazy, but I think that is a good place for a buff to be... or I am I totally off my rocker (which is possible), but just genuinely curious.<br />
<br />
I honestly don't know.<br />
<br />
The competitive, numbers-obsessed player in me thinks that Blizzard should be making changes with the knowledge that a lot of players care a lot about how well they perform in a competitive raid environment, even if they are not at the cutting edge. And those that don't care aren't going to care whether they buff Outlaw 4% or not (they were probably already playing Outlaw anyway)...<br />
<br />
So, if you have two camps (which I honestly think is a relatively realistic abstraction), one that cares about performing as well as their class can and one that plays the spec they enjoy (or find playable/easy to play), this change doesn't really affect either group. So, I guess the question just becomes does 4% make a raid that has a few Outlaw rogues in it capable of clearing content they were unable to before... I think the answer to that question is also no... Outlaw wasn't the worse spec (in fact it was the best scaling rogue spec to being with)... So, why are Ret Pallys or Feral Druids or DKs not getting buffs for the same reason? To make raids that bring a few better equipped to actually clear content.<br />
<br />
I just don't understand how Blizzard makes these decisions. It just seems pointless...</div></div><hr />

Sub is going to bottle neck as ilvl becomes relevant and Outlaw Rogues get Golganeth. Meanwhile Assassination Rogues are basically drowning at the bottom of the barrel, so instead of better overall scaling, a tier buff is DEFINITELY what they need when it's up there for % dmg increases for all dps.</div></div><hr />

Developers' notes: With this trinket and the 4-piece set, instead of receiving 2.5 seconds of reduction per Kill Command, you'll receive 1.25 seconds of cooldown reduction per Kill Command.<br />
<br />
No synergy then for T21 4pc/Bracers/COF .<br />

Actual BM Buffs where?<br />
Serpentstalker Guise 4-piece – Kill Command now reduces the cooldown of Aspect of the Wild by 2.5 seconds (was 1.5 seconds).<br />
<br />
2.0 sec - crap<br />
1.5 sec - more crap<br />
2.5 sec - more or less crap</div></div><hr />

Ulduar is getting timewalking, thats probably why they are touching it up.</div></div><hr />

They've started taking a stance against using old tier sets in new raids. Wish they'd take that same stance on trinkets like CoF and Arcano. Expecting Blizzard to be consistent in these matters isn't feasible, though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I see you haven't been aware of the issue until just recently.<br />
<br />
Boost sales haven't &quot;fucked WoW since the introduction of the wow token&quot;, boost sales have been a fact of this game since Classic.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't the common thing as today, where u can see it everywhere, and for sure back then in-game gold was just that, in-game gold, u can't buy Destiny or Overwatch with it, its value was very limited and for purely in-game stuff<br />
Now u can see ppl sell boosts on fb even</div></div><hr />
