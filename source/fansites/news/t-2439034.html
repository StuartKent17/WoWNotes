<meta name="description" content="Upcoming Azerite Armor Improvements Hotfix 
Two quick updates: 
 
Based on reports, we were able to find a strange behavior where a player's loot history could be inaccurate depending on the loot specialization they had selected. We believe this is why some players with average item levels over a certain Azerite threshold were seeing rewards lower than expected (e.g. players with 371+ average item level getting 355 Azerite caches). We have a hotfix currently in testing to correct this issue.

Two quick updates:<br />
<br />
Based on reports, we were able to find a strange behavior where a player's loot history could be inaccurate depending on the loot specialization they had selected. We believe this is why some players with average item levels over a certain Azerite threshold were seeing rewards lower than expected (e.g. players with 371+ average item level getting 355 Azerite caches). We have a hotfix currently in testing to correct this issue.<br />
<br />
Secondly, we agree that the requirements for the 370 caches were a little too high initially. With things like this, we tend to err on the side of being too conservative so that we can relax restrictions later if need be, and that's what we're doing here. We're going to lower the average item level threshold required to see 370 Azerite Armor in Emissary caches slightly in another upcoming hotfix.<br />
<br />
Both hotfixes are being worked on now, with the goal of getting them out later today.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No slack when the product has so many bugs on live. Especially this one that is actually happening for some time now (rewards lower than what was supposed to be).<br />
<br />
And the higher requirement for it is not a bug.</div></div><hr />

I think you're pretty far off here bud. People are mad because they completed the emissary prior to the hotfixes that Blizzard is working on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
this WQs are not going to give random Azerite from 5mans, will always be related to the PVP one like usually his and totally shit for many specs or some 1 or 2 other that is shit also<br />
<br />
Blizzard isn't dumb, they know this will not help anything about the original problem and are just giving free high ilvl loot for them to shut up and reveling their true nature and the RNG for all of us will continue</div></div><hr />

You look at the reward it says 355 so you go ahead and turn it in? Am i getting that straight? <br />
<br />
So your the dumbass that turned it in knowing something aint right? and now you cry about it on forums?<br />
<br />
Wow there is there sort of spectial people here.<br />
<br />
Now if it said it should be 370 and it was 355 then yes that is a bug but from reading that is not the case...</div></div><hr />

Not a bug<br />
<br />
&quot;Secondly, we agree that the requirements for the 370 caches were a little too high initially. With things like this, we tend to err on the side of being too conservative so that we can relax restrictions later if need be, and that's what we're doing here. We're going to lower the average item level threshold required to see 370 Azerite Armor in Emissary caches slightly in another upcoming hotfix.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Yeah, my 365 ilvl Warlock had 355 offered yesterday and 370 offered today. Turned it in and got a 370. My 355 Rogue still has 355 offered. I am not sure where the break point is now.</div></div><hr />

I'm at 362 ilvl and being offered a 355 piece still. All my azerite armors are at 370 already so a 355 is kind of useless to me. At least a 370 reward might have better traits and been worth using.</div></div><hr />
