Savage Defense and Blood Shield &quot;Issues&quot;<br />
There are two issues here.<br />
<br />
One is that the combat log is saying “refresh” in a confusing way when it’s really just applying damage to the shield (i.e. a new shield has not been created). We’re looking at some ways that might be fixed.<br />
<br />
The second issue has to do with our combat log (or third party logs) apparently disagreeing about what happened. Remember, our combat calculations are done on the realm side and then reported to the client, but the client only gets those reports periodically. The message has to travel a potentially long distance between your client and our realms. It’s important that the calculations are done realm-side though, to maintain gameplay integrity.<br />
<br />
Because of the latency inherent in client – realm communication, it can appear that a hit lands before the shield procs, yet still applies to the shield, leading to the mistaken impression that the proc isn’t occurring properly. In reality, the server is (probably) performing the steps correctly, but the client sometimes lags behind. For example, there's a case where what actually happened is this sequence: 1) shield proc, 2) hit, 3) absorb, but the client is slightly behind and instead (incorrectly) shows 1) hit, 2) shield proc, 3) absorb in the combat log. Or it could appear that you lost shield points without actually taking less damage, when in reality either the shield or your health pool weren’t affected. Or it could appear that if you take multiple hits nearly simultaneously that the shield did nothing to the later hits, but in reality the shield was gone on the first hit and your client just hasn’t been notified of that fact yet. We will investigate this issue just to make sure, but we’re pretty confident that Savage Defense and Blood Shield are working correctly and are just sometimes getting misreported. With Savage Defense lasting longer in 4.1, you may see this kind of thing more often.<br />
<br />
The takeaway is that latency can in some cases cause combat log display issues like the one we’re seeing here. We understand that a lot of you use the combat log as a reporting tool to analyze a fight after the fight has concluded. The combat log as currently implemented is supposed to give you a data feed in real time. We’d like to redesign the combat log to fill that post-combat analysis role better (as Ghostcrawler alluded to in a recent Q&amp;A) but that is a Very Big Task. Just delaying the current combat log so that it was in 100% parity with the server could cause serious issues with third party mods among other things, so we have to be careful not to turn a single screw and end up dismantling the whole machine, so to speak. Despite its limitations, it remains an accurate and useful tool in the vast majority of circumstances. <br />

<br />
Cool idea, I'll definitely give them that, but I can't help but wonder where Blizzard's priorities are at this point. On the game, or on the money? <br />
Charging extra monthly for something that could set them well above competition if it were free..? :confused:<br />

He was a genius, and then some, when it came to scripts. Wouldn't suprise me if he was actually a dev... because at the time, there were a couple devs in the guild. The alliance rogue near the Wintergrasp portal in Dalaran is named after one of them. I am amazed it took this long for them to release some type of remote guild chat.</div></div><hr />

That's not the point really. If they weren't paying these people to work on phone apps, they'd have more money to hire people to work on content.<br />
<br />
All these new updates are lame to me when we compare it to things from Wrath. I mean if you look at Wrath, we got the dungeon finder and achievements. Two pretty big things IMO. What have we gotten in Cata? RBGs are pretty big for the people that can do them, but that isn't a lot of people.<br />
<br />
I can't wait until the next expansion when we don't get a new class, race, or profession. And they push it forward with &quot;Remodeled Races&quot;!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Mainly I don't see a reason why Blizzard need to charge for it really, the get millions of dollars a month on subscriptions alone.<br />
<br />
Also here is a question that makes you think and I believe total biscuit brought it up once or twice why are Blizzard making WoW have a pay to play model with a cash shop and paid services (race change, server change)? I would understand if it was free to play for a cash shop and paid services like server change. The funny thing is in the case of server change it is a automated service so no people are personally transferring the data.<br />
<br />
I know it is capitalism at work and because people keep buying these services (especially those the cash shop items that don't have a charitable donation attached to it). I personally have played wow for several years and personally have never used any of there paid services, but does no one else find it interesting?</div></div><hr />

<br />
No, they'd have LESS money to hire ppl to work on content. The app will generate money (and others in this topic are whinign about that instead), more money than they spent letting (almost certainly) an external firm to develop the app. if they didn't expect to make a net profit on the app, they would never have developed it.

This seems to be designed for a fairly niche market, there is nothing more pressing than being able to chat with your guild? How about using one of the multitude of already available (and free) chat apps? The other features are worth next to nothing to me. To me Blizz is not only focused on generating more revenue, all their decisions are motivated by that. Yes they are a business, but they don't HAVE to generate more income, the game seems to be making them a fair sum of money as is. Customer service would be nice, like for example making tabard's like mounts, so people do not need to carry 10+ in their bags. That idea alone I think would be far more popular to most WoW players, but of course, no way to charge for that. My subscription ends in 2 weeks and I will not be renewing until they change their focus.<br />

I don't expect them to work for free, but I do expect them to not release paid services that only appeal to a very limited market. And why is chat a premium? I think they are testing to see how much they can charge and how many things they can tag onto user's bills before ppl say &quot;enough&quot;. I have never heard anyone on WoW or off ask for this. There are a thousand free alternatives, this was not well thought out and I'd bet money ppl at Blizz were not in favor of this.

You obviously don't know how a business with shareholders are run. Despite the fact that you may think Blizzard makes a boat load of money they probably don't, Think of all the servers, Bandwidth, devs, marketing people, maintenance etc etc. they have to pay its probably a small % overall.<br />
Look at the rest of the gaming industry for example, a company makes a game it may cost them 5 million to make, it sells 1 million copys the store, advertiser and devs/bosses take 50 of that (this actually happens, maybe not exact numbers but close to it) they end up profiting 5 million of the otherwise 60 million dollars .<br />
In other words Blizzard doesn't keep everything they make from subs, these services or Xpacs. They have bills to pay like the rest of us.<br />
An there a company of course they want to profit as much as possible , that's how company's work. No money, no Blizzard.<br />
<br />
People look at Money numbers and automatically think company's just have a big money pit in there building they swim in, hate to tell you but that only happens cartoons not the real world. Sorry if i destroyed your dreams. <br />

Do you read the forums? People have been asking for this for years. <br />
<br />
The game has gotten bigger since they first released it in 2004 things also cost more money now. (Did you know the US is just now recovering from the biggest recession ever?) This is there way of making up costs while not increasing your monthly charge, you don't like you don't buy.<br />
But they have a right to make money to pay there bills and maybe profit a little just like any other company.<br />
They could have just increased your sub by 3 dollars, would you rather have that?</div></div><hr />

A thousand times this. Go look at Activision Blizzard's financial reports. Their profits are pretty reasonable, in fact a little low, especially for a volatile business model like the video game industry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wrong.<br />
<br />
The purpose of a business, in most cases, is to earn profit.<br />
Profit is earned by providing services and/or products people are willing to pay for.<br />
<br />
No one is forcing you to subscribe to these optional services. So, please, remind me, why are you complaining again?<br />
<br />
<br />
So more paid services instead of actually fixing the problems this game has, or actually creating NEW content and armor/weapon models, why am I not surprised. This game is turning to shit faster and faster.<br />
<br />
You realize, of course, that companies this large have many, many different departments working on entirely different things. Right?<br />
<br />
Why is that so hard to understand?<br />
<br />
<br />
GG blizz, as if the sub fee for wow is unable to cover the costs of running the remote guild chat.<br />
<br />
Sure the profit incurred from player subscriptions could cover the cost, but then that's profit lost. Whereas they can provide a completely optional service and have those interested paying a very minimal addition to their monthly subscription to gain the benefit of these additional, non game breaking services.<br />
<br />
Gee. I wonder what option you'd choose if you were running a business, too.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Cool idea, I'll definitely give them that, but I can't help but wonder where Blizzard's priorities are at this point. On the game, or on the money? <br />
Charging extra monthly for something that could set them well above competition if it were free..? :confused:<br />
<br />
edit: Also, how does this add value to the game? Are players more likely to play longer because of this? ;)<br />
<br />
This is wrong...<br />
<br />
Remote Auction House is already available, for the same monthly fee... This is just added functionality (and implemented for an extra platform), nothing extra is being charged... This will be good in so many ways! If you cannot afford $3 per month, then don't... WoW is already an incredible cheap way of entertainment, compared to pretty much everything when you consider how many hours worth of experience you get from it per month.</div></div><hr />
