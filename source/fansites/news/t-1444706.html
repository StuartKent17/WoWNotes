<br />
Hi, I’m Chris Robinson, senior art director of World of Warcraft, and this is the first in a series of articles we're creating to bring you all closer to the development of the player character model revamps we announced at BlizzCon. In this series, we'll give you an inside look at the process we go through to do one of these revamps, discuss the kinds of art issues we're addressing with the new models, and provide a bit of insight our future plans for their continued polish.<br />
<br />
We're happy to begin our series by sharing a first look at where we're at with the Human female. While future articles won’t always be about revealing a new model, we thought this would be a great introduction to the approach we take for every one of these redesigns.<br />
<br />
We’re looking at these model revamps as a sort of “spiritual update” to the art content that currently exists in-game—except we’re completely redoing them from scratch. That includes the base model, skin tone variations, customization options (e.g. wrinkles, scars, moles, earrings, etc.), hairstyles, and any skin variations for NPCs you see out in the world, like Iron Dwarves or Leper Gnomes. We’re pretty excited about some of the ideas you've given us for new customization and skin options you’d like to see, but our first goal—which is already a monumental endeavor—is to make sure that the visual content that currently exists is brought up to or surpasses the level of quality you see in current boss models, the Pandaren, and central NPCs like the new Vol’jin model.<br />
<br />
With the revamp, we’re completely overhauling every aspect of the player models, but our goal is to do so while retaining the core look and feel that has always made them your character. We'll feel like we've succeeded if you see the updated version of your character and it still feels like you’re looking at the character you’ve been playing for the past however many years—only someone has finally focused a lens.<br />
<br />
To achieve this, we’re increasing the polygon count significantly (in some cases going from less than 1,000 to over 5,000), more than doubling the texture resolution, increasing bone count significantly to support updated animation and facial expression, and retouching nearly every animation for all of the characters. For animation alone, that’s roughly 180 animations per character, times 10 races in both male and female variants, equaling approximately 3,600 animations. We’re also incorporating the rigging technology we introduced with the Pandaren into every character to provide better posing, smoother animation, and the ability to pull off some fantastic facial expressions. In the weeks and months ahead, we’re going to be bringing you in for a closer look at some of the processes, challenges, and results of this revamp process.<br />
<br />
What you’re looking at here for the Human female is a single face option and a single skin tone on the base model without any animation or posing. When developing the base model we keep the expression on the face as devoid of emotion or expression as possible, as that allows our animators a greater range of motion when they start posing and morphing the face into different expressions. If we were to put any amount of expression—even a slight smile or mildly angry eyebrows—in the base model, that would carry through to every animation, and we'd end up with some very confused-looking characters.<br />
<br />
Joe Keller is a senior character artist on our team and was responsible for the lion’s share of modeling and texturing the Human female. Here's what he had this to say about this challenge:<br />
<br />
“Everyone is pretty familiar with the Human character models in WoW, but working on these updates gives us a chance to embellish and fill in the blanks. For the Human female this meant we could give her more muscle definition and personality in the face while still staying true to the overall look and spirit of the original. Hopefully this will also help show her as more of the capable fighter that she is.”<br />
<br />
This process has been a welcome challenge for all of us on the World of Warcraft art team. We’ve all wanted to address the player models and bring them up to a more current fidelity for some time now, and we’re as excited as you are to get these models into the game. We hope you’ll enjoy this series as we invite you to meet the team and see more on our development process.<br />
<br />
Thanks so much, and see you next time. <br />

Human model (both male and female) was probably the biggest fail of them all (maybe becouse you could easily compare that to human models from other games). It already looked kind of &quot;meh&quot; back in 2004 let alone 2013. New version is not spectacular but it is good enough for modern standards. Finally.</div></div><hr />

<br />
New models, new animations... for every NPC in most every city, town, village, many dungeons, world + quest NPCs... <br />
<br />
I just hope the player/NPC characters don't stand out too much when compared to the &quot;old&quot; NPC/mobs that still remain in the cities/towns etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, someone really likes Katy Perry.<br />
<br />
The &quot;dead staring eyes&quot; are part of the neutral expression for the sake of crafting animations. Rigging is more complex now, they can't just paint angry brows or cocky smirks on the faces directly without screwing up how the animations look.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't think some people realize the amount of work going into this. Tweaking animation and the way gear fits these new models alone is a lot of work. Not only redoing a single base model but updating all the character options to fit. I really like the direction these are going. I love the fact they are keeping the old hairstyle but just updating them to seem more natural. Good job, keep it up! Cannot wait to log in and see the world filled with the new models, it's going to be amazing!</div></div><hr />

No, he's just referring to the fact that none of the current skin color options are being shown and that they're just using the default pose that they're modelling the character in as opposed to a default &quot;standing idle&quot; pose. He's not hinting to more to come, just explaining why her pose is so awkward and why we're only seeing the pale skin color and no other facial features.</div></div><hr />

God shut up, seriously you have to be extremely dense to think that you won't notice a difference they are changing EVERYTHING about them and again it was the ART TEAM that is working on it, they don't do anything about the gameplay. Think before you post nonsense.</div></div><hr />

I do think the model itself looks great, but in that picture is my main's face and I do not like the updated version. The eyes, the mouth and the nose just are not the same. The nose has a completely different structure and tip, the eyes changed completely expression. As someone who stared at that exact face for more than 5 years I am worried.<br />
<br />
I sure hope that we get a free character customization with WoD.<br />
<br />
I agree. I have the same face as well and don't feel it's true to the old model at all. The nose is a lot more pointed, the mouth changed from a neutral one to a slight smile, and the eyes, they're probably the worst of all. They've got anime eyes now with a sultry, come hither look on them. I'm not impressed.</div></div><hr />

I seriously didn't expect this much of an update/difference, not even when I saw the Orc/Dwarf/Gnome models. The new human female just looks so shiny, new and updated in comparison. I could puppy whine about it not being rigged yet and no animations showing but I am currently too busy with gazing upon her ankles, wrists and hair. Dem ankles and wrists!

<br />
Human females weren't that bad before anyway.. and I get nervous for human males and night elf males when they say they are going to try and make the new models feel like the old..cos human males felt AWFUL -- very bad faces, very very bad, they didn't animate badly though... however night elf males animated badly - you had some cool aniamtions, but the casting animations were awful for night elf males and the walk animation was a complete fail on what could have been a really cool walk.<br />
<br />
also there is a danger of attractive night elf and human models, esp male models woudl further imbalance numbers towards the alliance than they already are, which would make sense to make them uglier than they can be and make the blood elf models even more attractive. But then if they make blodo elf models even more attractive vs human and night elf - we'll never hear the end to cries for high elves from alliance players.</div></div><hr />

Spoiler alert: each face in game now is just a different texture slapped onto the base model. Each face works the same, and no where in that article did they confirm one face. If anything they confirmed more customization options.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;What you’re looking at here for the Human female is a single face option and a single skin tone on the base model without any animation or posing. When developing the base model we keep the expression on the face as devoid of emotion or expression as possible, as that allows our animators a greater range of motion when they start posing and morphing the face into different expressions. If we were to put any amount of expression—even a slight smile or mildly angry eyebrows—in the base model, that would carry through to every animation, and we'd end up with some very confused-looking characters.&quot;<br />
<br />
Don't judge so quickly.<br />
<br />

Bolded it out for you above. This is the quickest way of doing it though; the single blank face of the model and letting the textures give it different appearances to make them look all different. They did it with the old models and seriously, most faces were pretty distinct then. Now with higher quality textures and extra customization options, the faces can only look even more different from one and another no matter that they share the same base.</div></div><hr />

I'm aware they only used a single face option. I'm saying that there isn't a confirmation that we're only getting one and if anything, getting more customization with our faces. Its a really nice change, even with the neutral face. Shes awesome.</div></div><hr />

It's like having one guy with a wrinkle on his forehead and the same guy without it and saying they're 2 different people.</div></div><hr />

10x better? Not remotely. It looks different. That's the good thing. EQN looks like a Pixar film, and that's what they're going for, but that doesn't make it bad. I prefer the stylistic design of WoW better myself too, though.<br />

You DO realise WoW (and Warcraft in general) has always had this cartoonish look. right? That's its signature. If you've been or are expecting WoW to reach last instalment of Tomb Raider's (as an example) realistic female model, you're wishing for something that will never happen.<br />

OT: I'm really, really happy about how this female human update is looking. I mean, it has muscles like a really fit woman, yet retains the curves of a feminine body. The art team perfectly captured the essence of how a heroin show look.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The hair models act like lego pieces on the body model itself. If you look at the bare model (the one with the least amount of hair) you will see the hair line looks like it has the hair pulled straight back. Now when the hair model is applied, like the one that has the comb-over, you can still see that the hair lines look as though they're pulled back, not pulled to the side as the hair would suggest.<br />
<br />
Now I'm not initially mad about this, but part of what separates good things from great things is attention to detail.</div></div><hr />

exept for one thing. might me just me but. her eyes. There abit too oogly for me..<br />
she be closed a little more or something? i dont know...<br />
<br />
There are no expressions or animations in her yet, they make her look that way on purpose because any emotion they put into the base model will carry over with the animations and make her look strange.</div></div><hr />

<br />
any uncanny valley is only because the models arent fixed to their proper animation skeletons yet. The skeletons allow for the organic and flowy feel to come out.<br />
<br />
I quite like the changes. there wasn't a lot to work with from the original models but thye managed to pull it off quite well<br />

their bodies have some muscle sculpting and are reasonably shaped, not ridiculously sexualized</div></div><hr />

I thought the same thing, but the more I look at it, the more I think that odd feeling, is because it is very human like, but we know it isn't (Uncanny Valley type stuff)<br />

<br /> 
New models, new animations... for every NPC in most every city, town, village, many dungeons, world + quest NPCs... <br />
<br />
I just hope the player/NPC characters don't stand out too much when compared to the &quot;old&quot; NPC/mobs that still remain in the cities/towns etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
They said they are going to replace every single character in game with the new models. So all human npcs will have the new models, not just player characters.</div></div><hr />

You must not watch very much anime, because those eyes look nothing like an anime character's . Additionally, you have a very odd sense of &quot;sultry&quot; if you think that blank stare is saying &quot;come hither.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Well, that doesn't really bode well for me. :/ Are they getting rid of the hag face, then? Are we only getting ONE base face for all our races? If so, opt me out because I'm not interested in playing same-face: the game.<br />

I agree about the eyes.<br />
<br />
But she's definitely smiling on the new version of that face. It's not nearly as bad as the female Gnome face (the only similarities on THAT example are the eye color and the hair color/style) but she's very definitely got an upward tilt at the edge of her lips.<br />
<br />
I don't understand WHY they have these smiles. The female Dwarf and female Forsaken models don't have this perma-friendly smile on their lips, so clearly they're capable of creating a neutral or even focused female expression.<br />
<br />
It's an absolutely minor complaint as far as Human goes, but it's a huge concern to me on the Gnome - the difference in degrees of the severity of change.</div></div><hr />

Uh. Okay, I don't really like the smilies as much as the next person but you need to understand this:<br />
<br />
The gnome female was rigged up to her animations. She was smiling because she was rigged up to her facial animations. Even on the gnome male if you look on his base-rig-no-animation, he has absolutely no smile at all.<br />
The female Dwarf and female Forsaken do not have those because they are NOT rigged to their animations yet. They are still in their base :| ready for animation mode.<br />
The smile on the new face is a tiny smile, but for all we know the vanilla one could of been smiling; It's hard to tell with textures that look like they fell out of someones ass, and the old rigging system made the textures on the mouth area pretty much null, since they were kind of muppet-style in terms of facial variety.</div></div><hr />

You forgot a piece.<br />
<br />
&quot;What you’re looking at here for the Human female is a single face option and a single skin tone on the base model without any animation or posing.&quot;<br />
<br />
There are lots of Human female faces. This reveal shows a single face option from a variety of angles, with several different hair styles, and also shows us a lot of the basic body changes. It would confuse the hell out of a lot of fans if they showed a different updated face with each picture of the Human female head. Kind of like they seem to have confused you by only using the one face for now. Why aren't you concerned that all of the Human females will all have the same skin tone?</div></div><hr />

Uh, well raids , dungeons and about everything else in the game is a 3d model. If they were so specialized why the hell does it take them so long to do one friggin model?<br />

<br />
They're side by side. The original Human female face with no expression is literally side by side with the new Human female face, and the new Human female face, sans animation, HAS A SMILE. It's a small smile, but it's clearly tilting up at the edges.<br />
<br />
The Gnome female faces - she's not using /smile emote. She's simply standing there. She's animated, wobbling around with the idle animation - okay. She's smiling the entire freaking time. Her idling face is absolutely smiling. It shouldn't be smiling. The face they apparently chose to use (side by side, Vanilla with Updated) clearly has no smile. And yet there is a smile plastered on her face, her eyebrows are up. She's friendly, interested, but she's not the same serious face Vanilla expressioned Gnome right beside.<br />
<br />
It's not just being rigged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because they're talking about how any slight emotion changes in the face texture would mess up the animation system.<br />
I don't know about you, but a lot of the human female faces in-game currently have a HUGE chunk of 'emotion' on them.<br />
Angry eyebrows, wrinkles, scowling faces, soft faces; Same with the gnomes. Why would they bother making all these faces again if they're gonna start out in the blank-face pose? Why would they bother rigging up the eyebrows pointing down on a certain face for the old angry-face look? It's also worrying to me because they mentioned wanting to even-out the face numbers (i believe it was a question about tauren females having 4 and human females having a hell of a lot more) and it could go one of two ways, and with their extra quip about how any emotion in the texture could mess things up, it makes me think they're going to trim out faces that have emotion in the texture.<br />
But then again, we don't know until they show us more. (which at this rate, who the frick knows when thatll happen.)<br />
<br />
Skin and hair doesn't really bother me so much as still having one single same face. I'm just worried that they're gonna skimp out and just say okay one face that works lolbye next model.<br />
<br />
I'm worried about them doing the same-face procedure because of their current track record with worgen and pandaren females; Same face, maybe different noses. (well, with the pandas it's literally same face, no different noses.)<br />
<br />
I'm not saying she looks bad; She really doesn't, I just don't want this single face and would like to be reassured they're not going the same-face route again.</div></div><hr />

wtf are you people expecting it to look like then? i mean seriously? considering the limitations they work with this looks 100% better than the older model. people never happy ::grumble grumble:: lol</div></div><hr />

I expected them to actually look better than games that came out 10 years ago. <br />
<br />
But let's face it, mmo-c is a wow fansite - there literally is no way to disagree here without mouth foaming rabid fan boys gurgling how it's evil for someone to even suggest that they should upgrade their 10 year old wooden computers or that Blizzard should invest some of the hundreds upon hundreds of millions they've made from the game back into it.<br />

Yarrrr. Granted, my assumption is going with &quot;You'll get all the faces you have now, but animated, and races with fewer options will get some more&quot; rather than &quot;Everyone gets 10 faces. If your race had more, well, we chose to scrap the least used options so if you had one of those, you'll get stuck with another of our choice.&quot; I get that animating a bunch of different faces means more work, but animating familiar face types will certainly be a lot easier than animating animal-faces-turned-humanoid.<br />
<br />
I'm rather invested in the Gnome female faces - that's mainly what I play, and they're completely different people if the preview was any indication of how drastic differences in the idle, &quot;blank&quot; face is any indication. The Human (which my main was, until another racial option opened up to my class) is just a much better representation of the face it was based upon, that the lips are the only thing that's standing out to me, and on the Human it's just plain a lot more subtle of a difference. I'm having to look hard at the original face and can see how the tilt could be more up, or more neutral.</div></div><hr />

How about standing in a city with 1000 Lara Crofts moving around your screen?<br />
<br />
You wont.<br />
<br />
There are never ever 1000 in direct line of sight of you so that the graphic card needs to render it.<br />
Armor cover a lot of it (that doesnt need to be rendered more than today). Not everyone will be naked you know.<br />
Graphic cards now can handle more than 5 times what they did in 2004<br />
The amount of polygons on the avatar (on this level) is not what makes graphic cards have the biggest problems.<br />
Compare to any other MMO game out there and you will see that 5000~ polygons for an avatar is quite low.<br />
My example of lara croft was from 2008(!) on a console...</div></div><hr />

No, not this. Wow was never about very realistic graphics, they maintained the cartoony style with these new models. <br />
<br />
Really liking the new model btw. My rogue will be very happy :)<br />

This is by design - since expression and emotion are done in animation now (and not painted on the character model's texture), faces and poses will be mostly blank in previews like this unless the animation team gussies it up a bit first.</div></div><hr />

Why do you have such expecatations? Wow will never have the models that for instance GW2 has, that's just part of the style of Wow.<br />
And these new models are a big upgrade from the old ones.</div></div><hr />

For now my favorite is the female human from what I've seen. Can't wait for the female night elf.<br />
Only thing I don't like about this news is that there isn't a working 3D model and emotes. Really wanted to see those.</div></div><hr />

This will never happen. The main reason being that there could easily be 100+ of these new models gathered in a single area--the computer requirements jump would be massive.</div></div><hr />

Facial examples are a bit meaningless until the animation team touches them. These previews are more to show us what the model will look like as a whole - we're still not getting the whole picture because little touches (stance, eyelids, etc) aren't shown.</div></div><hr />
