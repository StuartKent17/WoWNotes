<br />
Warlords of Draenor Alpha Official Notes Update<br />
<br />
Game System Changes<br />
<br />
Stat Squish<br />
We've also streamlined the multitude of various types of Haste % and Crit % bonuses.<br />
<br />
Spell Haste %, Melee Haste %, and Ranged Haste % have been merged into a universal Haste %.<br />
Spell Crit %, Melee Crit %, and Ranged Crit % have been merged into a universal Crit %.<br />
<br />
<br />
Itemization Changes (New Section)<br />
We’re making a number of changes to itemization based on a single philosophy: We want to increase the chance that any given item drop is useful to someone in your group.To support this philosophy we’re making a few changes to stats. Most items found in Draenor will work for all specializations within a given class, so that you never have to grumble when you see, for example, Intellect plate drop in a group that lacks a Holy Paladin.<br />
<br />
We’re also reducing the number of role-specific stats: Hit and Expertise are gone, as are Dodge and Parry as stats on items, replaced with a single tank stat of Bonus Armor. Armor and Spirit will be specific to tanks and healers respectively, but all other secondary stats will have universal appeal.<br />
<br />
Because of the magnitude of this change, we’re retroactively applying this philosophy to items in Mists of Pandaria. After the pre-expansion patch you may find that some of your items contribute different stats, but they should still be good for your class.<br />
<br />
General<br />
<br />
New secondary stats added:<br />
<br />
Bonus Armor: Increases armor.<br />
Multistrike: Grants a chance for spells and abilities to fire an additional time, at 30% effectiveness (both damage and healing).<br />
Readiness: Reduces the cooldown of several class abilities with long-cooldowns.<br />
<br />
Hit and Expertise on all items have been replaced with a universally useful secondary stat.<br />
Stats that are not useful to your current class specialization will be grayed out in the tooltip rather than green, and will not be counted on your character stat sheet.<br />
<br />
Spirit for non-healing specializations<br />
Bonus Armor for non-tanking specializations<br />
Strength for Agility/Intellect-users<br />
Agility for Strength/Intellect-users<br />
Intellect for Strength/Agility-users<br />
For example, Intellect on a cloak will be greyed out for all Warrior specializations and they will not receive an increase to Intellect if equipped. However, if the same cloak is equipped by a Mage, Intellect will show up as green and they’ll receive the increase to their Intellect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mists of Pandaria and Future Items<br />
<br />
Dodge and Parry have been replaced with Bonus Armor. If an item had both Dodge and Parry on it, it has been replaced with an additional useful secondary stat.<br />
Head, Chest, Hand, Wrist, Waist, Leg, Feet, Weapon, Shield, and Off-hand items that had tanking stats (Dodge, Parry) or healer stats (Spirit) have been replaced with a different universally useful secondary stat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Items<br />
<br />
Plate Armor pieces will always have Strength and Intellect on it.<br />
Mail and Leather Armor pieces will always have Agility and Intellect on it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ability Pruning<br />

<br />
<br />
Crowd Control and Diminishing Returns<br />
Additionally, we've significantly reduced the number of throughput-increasing cooldowns and procs, in order to further reduce burst damage. Please keep in mind when reading the specifics of the patch notes that some classes may have lost abilities, or had the power of select abilities reduced. These changes were made in the context of the above goals. Other classes have a reduced crowd-control ability overall. We believe that this entire package of changes will make PvP a more enjoyable experience for everyone.<br />

<br />
<br />
Movement Speed (New Section)<br />
Moving quickly has always been a powerful bonus in World of Warcraft; however, the logic of how various movement speed bonuses stack (or don't) has generally been inconsistent and poorly explained. Under the old set-up, each movement speed bonus would become more powerful when combined with another, so we would limit what can stack with what, and prevent certain abilities from being used when another one is already in effect. We decided to change the movement speed system to make it more transparent, with rules about stacking that are easier to understand, and with fewer restrictions.<br />
<br />
Previously, multiple movement speed modifiers on you were multiplicative, meaning that if you had two different +25% movement speed bonuses, they resulted in a total movement speed of 56% (1.25*1.25 = 1.56).<br />
<br />
Movement speed bonuses have been changed to be additive. The previous example with two different +25% movement speed bonuses would result in a total movement speed of +50%. The logic governing which bonuses stack with others has been simplified as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
If a bonus is self-only and passive, it now stacks additively with everything.<br />
If a bonus is temporary or applies to other players, it's considered exclusive, and the character only gains the benefit of the highest exclusive bonus.<br />
<br />
<br />
Additionally, restrictions that prevented a player with a temporary speed bonus from receiving or activating a second temporary speed bonus have been removed. Both bonuses will now apply to the character, but only the one with the highest magnitude will have any effect.<br />
<br />
Examples of self-only passive bonuses: Cat Form, Movement Speed enchants, Quickness racial for Night Elves, Unholy Presence<br />
<br />
<br />
These will all stack additively with each other.<br />
<br />
<br />
Examples of shared or temporary bonuses: Angelic Feather, Sprint, Stampeding Roar<br />
<br />
<br />
All of these effects can now be applied simultaneously, but only the strongest one will have an effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Raid Utility Balance (New Section)<br />
Various classes bring various abilities that provide utility to parties and raids. We talked about one type of utility in the Buffs and Debuffs section, above. However, there are other types of raid utility, and it’s been in need of more attention. In general, raid utility, especially raid-wide defensive cooldowns, had grown too strong. So many classes and specializations had defensive cooldowns that we had to make raid damage extremely high, as raids would be stacking or chaining together multiple cooldowns. We'd like to return to a system where it's the healers who heal through the scary moments, not the damage dealers, for example.<br />
<br />
To do so, we’ve established a new baseline level of raid utility that a specialization should bring, and brought everyone to that new standard by reducing the effects of some abilities, or removing some abilities altogether.<br />

<br />
<br />
Periodic Effects (New Section)<br />
There are many effects in the game which deal periodic damage over time (DoT) or healing over time (HoT). Historically, these have typically done something called “snapshotting”; they were based on your stats at the time that they were cast, and that was used for calculating their effect for their full lifetime. In Mists, if a warlock casts Corruption on an enemy while Heroism is active, that DoT will continue to tick rapidly based on the temporary haste effect, even after Heroism fades. This has led to some gameplay that has both good and bad sides.<br />
<br />
Snapshotting encourages refreshing those periodic effects when your stats are high, such as when a temporary buff procs. On the upside, there's a high amount of skill involved in maximizing that. On the downside, it's not intuitive, and the skill ceiling is so high that few can reach it without the use of specialized add-ons. To make matters worse, the benefits of maximizing periodic snapshotting is so high that it creates a balance problem. Players maximizing periodic snapshotting (primarily through the use of add-ons) do drastically more damage than intended. If we balance around taking full advantage of snapshotting, then the players who aren’t doing so would fall unacceptably far behind in damage output.<br />
<br />
Ultimately, we've decided that snapshotting isn't a productive mechanic for the game. The vast majority of periodic effects in the game that snapshotted no longer do so. The only exceptions are ones that do damage based on a percentage of a previous ability's damage (such as the Ignite from a Fire Mage's Fireball, or the periodic damage on a Windwalker Monk's Blackout Kick), as they inherently act as a delayed damage multiplier to those abilities.Temporary effects which buff the damage or healing of other spells specifically will continue to do so for their lifetime; for example, Unleash Flame (which increases the damage of the shaman's next fire spell by 40%), when used on a Flame Shock, will continue to increase the damage of the periodic effect for its entire lifetime, despite being consumed when the Flame Shock is cast. We still of course want skills and their use to embody interesting choices, and intelligent and skillful use of abilities.<br />
<br />
<br />
Periodic damage and healing effects now dynamically recalculate their damage, healing, Critical chance, multipliers, and period on every tick.<br />
<br />
<br />
Skilled players will still be able to take advantage of temporary power buffs like trinket procs, and you'll still want to cast your hardest hitting spells within those proc durations. The benefits just won't extend outside the trinket procs’ duration. As such, this high-skill gameplay is there, it's just rewarded more consistently. For example, a Priest’s trinket procs and an already active Shadow Word: Pain will begin dealing more damage the instant the proc effect occurs, but will return to normal when the proc duration ends. Skilled players will be able to play within these proc durations to maximize effect, but it won’t be as detrimental to output to anyone who isn’t actively and skillfully using them to their full extent.<br />
<br />
We also made another change to periodic effects. Haste has long affected the tick rate of periodic effects, and their duration has been rounded to whole numbers of ticks, in order to mostly preserve the original duration of the spell. This lead to Haste breakpoints where having specific amounts of Haste would cause certain periodic effects to gain an extra tick. Part of gearing your character involved trying to reach those Haste breakpoints, but not go over by too much. This was a fairly tedious number to manage, which was again mostly handled by add-ons and guides. With some new tech we’re now able to calculate the effect of Haste on tick time dynamically. Any fraction of a full period left at the end of an effect will do a tick of damage or healing in proportion to the remaining time. In other words, there are no more Haste breakpoints; Haste now smoothly and accurately affects periodic effects for the entire duration.<br />
<br />
This also opened up the opportunity to revise how we handle refreshing periodic effects. For the vast majority of spells and abilities, we had a standard rule that any refresh would add the new cast's duration after the next tick of the existing effect. In simpler terms, you can refresh anywhere between the last and second-to-last tick of a DoT or HoT with no loss. Warlocks had a special passive that changed this logic to allow refreshing with no loss anywhere in the last 50% of a DoT. We liked the flexibility that this provided; though felt it was a bit too powerful. No longer tied to whole tick times, we chose to extend the mechanic that Warlocks had to all classes, but reduce it to 30%. Everyone can now refresh their periodic effects anywhere in the last 30% of the duration for full benefit, and no lost tick time.<br />
<br />
<br />
Recasting periodic damage over time and healing over time effects that are already on the target now extends those effects to up to 130% of the normal duration of the effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Tank Vengeance and Resolve<br />
The changes to tanking made in Mists of Pandaria turned out quite well, overall. But there were a few rough parts that we're going to smooth over. The biggest one is the offensive capabilities of Vengeance. We like that tanks can provide meaningful DPS to their group, however, it swung wildly based on the fight, even surpassing the dedicated damage dealers occasionally. To solve this, we're going to remove the offensive value of Vengeance, but preserve the defensive value, by making it increase the effect of your active mitigation buttons, instead of Attack Power.<br />
<br />
Then, to keep tank DPS meaningful, we'll be raising their damage, since it would be meager with no Vengeance Attack Power (Vengeance accounted for 70-90% of a tank's damage on high-tank-damage fights in Mists). To do that, we're increasing the damage of several prominent tank abilities, as well as having tanks also gain increased Attack Power from Mastery, in addition to the stat’s existing benefits. That also helps keep secondary stats balanced in offensive value for them.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Quality of Life Improvements<br />
Facing Requirements<br />
Strict facing requirements can be frustrating to deal with, especially in hectic Raid combat or PvP environments. In order to ease this frustration, we decided to remove or significantly loosen the facing requirements of all attacks that required the player to be behind their target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid: Ravage no longer requires the Druid to be behind the target.<br />
<br />
<br />
Reforging (New Section)<br />
The original intent behind Reforging was to offer a way for players to customize their gear, but in practice it offered little in the way of true choice. Players attempting to optimize every piece of gear were well advised to look up how they were supposed to reforge an item in an online guide or tool that had already determined the optimal choice. It added yet another step to the list of things that must be done to a new item before it was ready to be equipped, reducing the joy of getting an upgrade into a chore.<br />
<br />
If an upgrade drops, we want you to be able to equip it with a minimum of fuss. It is for those reasons that we’re removing Reforging from the game.<br />
<br />
The Reforging system and associated NPCs have been removed from the game.<br />
All existing items that were reforged have been returned to their original un-reforged state.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combat Resurrections (New Section)<br />
Combat resurrections are an extremely powerful tool that players have while in combat. Naturally, we apply some limitations. In Mists of Pandaria, that limit was 1 resurrection during a given raid boss encounter for 10-player modes and 3 for 25-player modes. With Flexible difficulty introduced in Patch 5.4, we erred on the forgiving side, and gave Flexible Raids 3 resurrections regardless of raid size.<br />
<br />
In Warlords of Draenor, the Flex tech has expanded to more difficulty levels, and we needed a new system to handle combat resurrections more fairly. We knew that continuing with a constant 3 would encourage using the smallest possible raid sizes, while scaling with hard breakpoints would discourage specific group sizes just under those points. Additionally, the limit is not shown anywhere in-game, so it can be easy to lose track of how many resurrections the raid has available (or even know that the limit exists).<br />
<br />
So we’ve built a new system to be more transparent, and improve usability.<br />
<br />
<br />
During a boss encounter, all combat resurrection spells now share a single raid-wide pool of charges that’s visible on the action bar button.<br />
Upon engaging a boss, all combat resurrection spells will have their cooldowns reset and begin with 1 charge. Charges will accumulate at a rate of 1 per (90/RaidSize) minutes.<br />
<br />
Example 1: A 10-player raid will accumulate 1 charge every 9 minutes (90/10 = 9).<br />
Example 2: A 20-player raid will accumulate 1 charge every 4.5 minutes (90/20 = 4.5).<br />
<br />
A charge will only be deducted when a combat resurrection is successful (when the target accepts the resurrection).<br />
Raid frames now show a debuff indicating that a dead player has a pending combat resurrection available.<br />
Outside of raid boss encounters, combat resurrection spells retain their normal cooldown behavior.<br />
<br />
<br />
Glyphs<br />
We made several improvements to the Glyph system. While leveling, characters unlock Glyph slots at several specific levels. However, in order to get glyphs, characters need to visit an Auction House (and potentially pay way more gold than an average character of that level has yet), or know a Scribe from which to request them. To solve this, we've made characters learn some Glyphs automatically as they level. Additionally, we now have the ability to make some glyphs exclusive with each other, or require specific specializations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Many glyphs have been removed, and many new glyphs have been added.<br />
Exclusive categories have been added for some glyphs. Other glyphs from the same category cannot be applied at the same time.<br />
Some glyphs are now exclusive to a specialization.<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Movement Speed enchants now increase Movement Speed by 10% (up from 8%).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Class Changes<br />
<br />
Death Knight<br />
We removed Dodge and Parry from gear, and expect Blood Death Knights to value Haste and Crit as important secondary stats. In order to achieve that, we made Riposte give defensive value to Critical Strikes, and Scent of Blood give defensive value to Multistrike. auto attack and Rune Strike crits. To solve GCD-capping issues and increase the value of Haste, we also removed the passive rune regeneration increase from Improved Blood Presence. Finally, we tweaked the targeting AI of Dancing Rune Weapon, and fixed it up to properly copy most Talents that you know.<br />
<br />
<br />
Riposte has been redesigned.<br />
<br />
Riposte now gives the Death Knight Parry equal to their Critical Strike bonus from gear. After getting a Critical Strike with an Auto Attack or Rune Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/56815), you gain +100% Parry chance until you Parry an attack. This can stack up to 2 times.<br />
<br />
Improved Blood Presence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/50371) no longer increases rune regeneration rate.<br />
<br />
<br />
There were also a few other miscellaneous changes. The Runic Power generation of Anti-Magic Shell was standardized, to make it more understandable and balanced. Level-60 and Level-75 talent rows have swapped places, so the important rune regeneration talents could be acquired earlier.<br />
<br />
Level-60 and Level-75 talent rows have swapped places.<br />
<br />
<br />
Druid<br />
Note that Primal Tenacity's calculation uses the damage before any other absorbs you have, and before Tooth and Claw's effects, so that it isn’t negatively affected by any of those. Note that Primal Tenacity's calculation uses the damage before any other absorbs you have, and before Tooth and Claw's effects, so that it isn’t negatively affected by any of the changes. We also slightly reduced the power of Primal Fury, in order to better balance secondary stats for Guardians.<br />
<br />

Tooth and Claw can now accumulate 2 charges, and its effects stack on the target. Its effects are affected by Resolve.<br />
Ursa Major is a new passive ability for Guardian Druids:<br />

Ursa Major: Multistrikes from auto attacks and Mangle (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/33878) grant the Druid Ursa Major. Ursa Major increases maximum health by 5% for 15 seconds. When this effect is refreshed, the remaining portion is added to the new effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Feral Druids received one major change, and few tweaks beyond what's been mentioned above in Ability Pruning and Facing Requirements. Combo Points are now stored &quot;on the player&quot;, meaning that when you switch targets, any accumulated Combo Points remain with you. Pounce was buffed significantly, in order to bring it up to par with Ravage. Primal Fury was changed to let it affect area attacks as well. Glyph of Savagery was reworked to better achieve its intended effect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combo Points for Feral Druids are now shared across all targets, and are no longer lost when switching targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overall, we are happy with Balance's rotation, however there are a few tweaks coming through Draenor Perks. With the changes to Periodic Effects, we're slightly modifying Eclipse to allow it to retain the gameplay it had before.<br />
<br />
<br />
Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) now increases the damage of all Nature spells (or Arcane, depending on which Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) state is active) cast while it is active. This means that for example: a Moonfire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8921) cast during Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) will receive the Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) benefit through its whole duration, even after leaving Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577). The reverse also holds true; a Moonfire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8921) cast before entering Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) will not benefit from that Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) until it is recast.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the Druid changes are capped off by merging Glyph of Stampede's effects into Glyph of Stampeding Roar.<br />
<br />
Glyph of Stampede (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/40906) has been removed. Its effects have been merged into Glyph of Stampeding Roar (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/45604).<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunter<br />
We did a comprehensive pass on Hunter pet abilities. As mentioned above in Crowd Control and Diminishing Returns, all full crowd-control abilities have been removed from Hunter pets and replaced those with new abilities, including spreading some that were previously restricted to exotic pets. Additionally, Hunters can now tame beasts from new pet families.<br />
<br />
<br />
Hunters may now tame beasts from 3 new pet families.<br />
<br />
Hydra<br />
Riverbeast<br />
Hook Wasp (Exotic)<br />
<br />
Abilities unique to each hunter pet family have been revised to provide a standard buff, debuff, or ability.<br />
<br />
Combat Resurrection ability: Crane, Moth, Quilen<br />
Mortal Wounds debuff: Carrion Bird, Devilsaur, Riverbeast, Scorpid<br />
Increased Spell Power buff: Serpent, Silithid, Water Strider<br />
Increased Strength/Agility/Intellect buff: Dog, Gorilla, Shale Spider, Worm<br />
Increased Critical Strike Chance buff: Devilsaur, Quilen, Raptor, Shale Spider, Water Strider, Wolf<br />

Increased Haste buff: Hook Wasp, Hyena, Sporebat, Wasp<br />

Increased Magic Damage Taken debuff: Basilisk, Bat, Chimaera, Core Hound, Dragonhawk, Rhino, Wind Serpent<br />
Increased Physical Damage Taken debuff: Bird of Prey, Boar, Porcupine, Ravager, Rhino, Worm<br />
An ability that increases dodge chance of the pet by 30% for 10 seconds: Fox, Monkey<br />
An ability that reduces damage taken by the pet by 50% for 12 seconds: Beetle, Crab, Quilen, Rhino, Shale Spider, Turtle<br />
An ability that Reduces the movement speed of the target by 50%: Chimaera, Crocolisk, Silithid, Spider, Warp Stalker<br />
The following pet families provide an ability that puts the pet in stealth mode, but slows its movement speed by 50%. The first attack from stealth receives a 20% bonus to damage: Cat, Spirit Beast<br />
The following pet families also provide an additional ability.<br />
<br />
Chimaera - Froststorm Breath: Causes Froststorm damage to all targets in front of the Chimaera over 8 sec.<br />
Core Hound - Molten Hide: Causes Fire damage to attackers.<br />
Devilsaur - Feast: The devilsaur feasts on a nearby Humanoid or Beast corpse within 5 yards, healing it for 20% of its maximum health and restoring 20 focus over 5 sec.<br />
Direhorn - Reflective Armor Plating: Deflects all spells cast in front of the Direhorn for 6 seconds.<br />
Hook Wasp - Flutter: Slows the fall speed of both itself and the hunter for 30 seconds.<br />
Spirit Beast - Spirit Mend: Heals the target ally instantly, and additional healing over 10 seconds.<br />
Water Strider - Surface Trot: Allows the Hunter and the Water Strider to walk across water.<br />
Worm - Burrow Attack: Deals Nature damage to nearby enemies over 8 seconds.<br />
<br />
<br />
There were also a few other changes, primarily for quality of life and rotational consistency.<br />
<br />
<br />
Aimed Shot (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19434) now deals 20% more damage and can be cast while moving. no longer interrupts Auto Attacks.<br />
Growl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/6795) now has a 30-yard range.<br />
Several raid buffs provided by pets have been changed into auras that are automatically applied to the Hunter's party or raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mage<br />
In order to solve all of these problems, we decided to merge the 3 current Bomb Talents into one that changes based on spec. That allows us to reintroduce spec-specific perks to each Bomb, and makes room for some non-DoT alternatives.<br />
<br />
<br />
Frost Bomb (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/113092) has been redesigned. It now lasts 12 seconds, has no cooldown, and explodes every time the target is critically hit by the Mage's Ice Lance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/30455) while frozen. The damage per explosion has been reduced by 75% to compensate.<br />
Glyph of Mirror Image (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/45739) has been removed and its effects have been incorporated into Mirror Image (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/55342).<br />
Glyph of Frostfire Bolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/44684) is now available only to Fire Mages.<br />
<br />
<br />
Monk<br />
<br />
Stance of the Spirited Crane is a new ability for Mistweaver Monks, which replaces Stance of the Fierce Tiger (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/103985).<br />
<br />
The Spell-Power-to-Attack-Power Conversion (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/119975) effect has been moved from Stance of the Wise Serpent (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115070) to Stance of the Spirited Crane.<br />
The Eminence effect has been moved from Stance of the Wise Serpent (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/115070) to Stance of the Spirited Crane.<br />
<br />
Eminence now a nearby target to be healed for 35% of all damage caused by the Monk and includes auto attacks.<br />
<br />
Serpent's Zeal has been removed. Eminence now always includes Auto Attacks.<br />
Muscle Memory, Serpent's Zeal, and Vital Mists have been replaced with a new passive ability, Crane Style Techniques. Crane Style Techniques enhances several of the Monk's combat abilities while in Crane Stance. merged. Muscle Memory now requires Stance of the Spirited Crane, and passively increases the damage of Crackling Jade Lightning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/117952) by 100%, causes Tiger Palm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100787) to trigger the Vital Mists effect, and causes Blackout Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100784) to hit 4 additional nearby targets for 50% damage.<br />
<br />
Crackling Jade Lightning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/117952) channels 150% faster, generates 1 Chi each time it deals damage, but costs 300% more mana.<br />
Blackout Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100784) grants Crane's Zeal, increasing Critical Strike chance by 20% for 20 seconds.<br />
Blackout Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100784) causes Eminence to heal 5 allies instead of 1, but heals for only 15% of damage dealt instead of 35%.<br />
The Monk gains a stack of Vital Mists for every Chi consumed.<br />
<br />
Rising Sun Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/107428) is now available to Mistweaver and Windwalker Monks. However, it does not cause Mortal Wounds for Mistweavers.<br />
<br />
The Windwalker passive ability, Combat Conditioning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/128595), now causes Rising Sun Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/107428) to cause Mortal Wounds, instead of causing Mortal Wounds naturally.<br />
<br />
The following abilities now require Stance of the Spirited Crane for Mistweavers:<br />
<br />
Blackout Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100784), Jab (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100780), Rising Sun Kick (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/107428), Tiger Palm (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100787)<br />
<br />
<br />
We also did some polishing on Brewmasters and Windwalkers and made Storm, Earth, and Fire, Transcendence, and Touch of Death easier to use. Fists of Fury has also been improved; sometimes brute force is the right answer. Gift of the Ox was changed to give value to the new Multistrike stat for Brewmasters. Lastly, Tiger Strikes was improved considerably, and made available to all Monk specializations.<br />
<br />
<br />
Gift of the Ox (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/124502) now has a chance to trigger only from auto attack Multistrikes, instead of from all auto attacks. It has a 100% chance to trigger while using a two-handed weapon, and a 62.5% chance to trigger while dual wielding.<br />
Fists of Fury (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/113656) now deals 100% increased damage, and always deals full damage to your primary target; additional targets are still affected by the damage split.<br />
Tiger Strikes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/120272) is now available to all Monk specializations, and has a chance to trigger on successful auto attacks and their Multistrikes. It has an 8% chance to trigger while using a two-handed weapon, and a 5% chance to trigger while dual wielding.<br />
<br />
When triggered, Tiger Strikes (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/120272) now grants +50% Multistrike for 8 seconds instead of +50% attack speed and double attacks for 4 attacks.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Paladin<br />
We made several changes for Holy, to go along with other larger system changes to compensate for the removal of Guardian of Ancient Kings from Holy, and merged its benefits into Divine Favor. In order to follow through on our change to merge all types of Haste %, we removed the Spell Haste % from Seal of Insight to a Holy-only passive, so that it didn't also increase Protection's baseline Haste by 10%. Our changes to healer mana and mobility also indirectly increased the value of Selfless Healer by a large amount, so we brought it back down to be even in power with the other talents on its row. We also raised the range of Denounce to be consistent with other spells.<br />
<br />
<br />
Infusion of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/53576) now also passively increases Haste by 10%.<br />
Seal of Insight (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20165) no longer increases spell Haste by 10%.<br />
Selfless Healer (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85804) for Holy no longer causes Judgment (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20271) to grant Holy Power. It also is only usable on Flash of Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/19750), no longer on Holy Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/635) or Holy Radiance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/82327).<br />
<br />
<br />
For Protection, we tweaked Eternal Flame in order to reduce its massive self-healing amount, and provide better balance between talents on that row. We also added a new passive, Shining Protector, in order to give defensive value to the new Multistrike stat.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bastion of Glory no longer affects the periodic healing of Eternal Flame (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114163). It still affects the direct healing portion of the ability.<br />
Shining Protector is a new passive ability for Protection Paladins.<br />
<br />
Shining Protector: All heals you receive have a chance equal to your Multistrike chance to trigger Shining Protector, healing you for an additional 30% of the triggering heal.<br />
<br />
Eternal Flame (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114163) now deals 100% of the direct healing of Word of Glory (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/85673) (up from 70%), but only 50% as much periodic healing as before. Additionally, Bastion of Glory no longer affects the periodic healing.<br />
<br />
<br />
We made a few additional changes to Paladins. We revised the functionality of Hammer of the Righteous a bit, such that its performance is about the same, but its tooltip is much clearer. We also made Stay of Execution much more attractive to use as an emergency button. One big change for Retribution that isn't mentioned here is the removal of Inquisition (see Ability Pruning), which will have a notable effect on their rotation.<br />
<br />
Priest<br />
<br />
Angelic Feather (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121536), if cast on players, will always prefer the casting priest over others, then pick the player closest to the targeted location. If there are no players where it is targeted, it will still create a feather that can be picked up, as before. Additionally, when collecting multiple feathers, the duration will be extended instead of replaced; up to a maximum of 130% of base duration.<br />
Inner Focus (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/89485): No longer provides immunity to Dispels, Interrupts, and Silence (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/15487). This effect will be returning as a Major Glyph.<br />
Purify (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/527), Halo (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/120517), Cascade (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/121148), and Divine Star (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/110745) can now be cast while in Spirit of Redemption (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/20711) form.<br />
Shadowfiend (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/34433) no longer restores mana.<br />
<br />
Mindbender (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/123040) now restores 0.75% mana per hit (down from 1.75%).<br />
<br />
<br />
Rogue<br />
There are a number of Rogue changes listed under Ability Pruning, but there are a few additional changes to note. The biggest of which is a fundamental change to how Combo Points work. They're now shared across all enemies; you can swap targets and you won;t lose your Combo Points.<br />
<br />
<br />
Combo Points for Rogues are now shared across all targets. You no longer lose your Combo Points when switching targets.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shaman<br />
In Warlords of Draenor, we're pulling back on the ability for many casters to deal damage while moving, and that includes Elemental. They will still have some ability to deal damage while moving, through Shocks, Unleash Weapon, and instant Lava Bursts. For Chain Lightning, we wanted to reduce the impact of Haste soft capping, and so changed Shamanism to increase damage instead of reduce cast time. Additionally, we simplified Wind Shear by removing its impact on threat, which no longer matters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ascendance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/114049) for the Enhancement specialization now changes the Shaman's auto attacks and Stormstrike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/17364) to deal Wind-based physical damage that bypasses armor.<br />
Earthquake (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/61882) damage has been increased by 36%.<br />
Echo of the Elements (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108283) has been redesigned. The Shaman's spells and abilities have a chance to trigger Echo of the Elements (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108283), causing their next short-cooldown spell or ability to not trigger a cooldown.<br />
<br />
Elemental: It may be used on Earth Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8042), Flame Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8050), Frost Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8056), Earthquake (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/61882), or Lava Burst (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/51505).<br />
Enhancement: It may be used on Earth Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8042), Flame Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8050), Frost Shock (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8056), Fire Nova (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1535), Lava Lash (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/60103), or Stormstrike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/17364).<br />
Restoration: It may be used on Healing Rain (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/73920), Purify Spirit (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/77130), or Riptide (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/61295).<br />
<br />
Using Unleashed Fury (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/117012) with Windfury Weapon (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8232) imbue active now increases Multistrike chance by 10%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warrior<br />
<br />
Sudden Death (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29725) can no longer trigger from Opportunity Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/76858).<br />
<br />
<br />
Protection Warriors have received a few notable changes. First, we removed Dodge and Parry from gear, and expect Protection Warriors to value Haste and Crit as important secondary stats. In order to achieve that, we made Riposte give defensive value to Crits. The aforementioned Headlong Rush also helps for valuing Haste.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blood Craze is a new passive ability for Protection Warriors.<br />
<br />
Blood Craze causes Multistrike auto attacks to trigger a Blood Craze, which regenerates 3% of the Warrior's health over 3 seconds. When this effect is refreshed, the remaining duration is added to the new effect.<br />
<br />
Riposte has been redesigned.<br />
<br />
Riposte now gives the Warrior Parry equal to their Critical Strike bonus from gear. gives the Warrior +100% to Parry chance until they Parry an attack after getting a critical strike with an Auto Attack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The theme is great, very evocative of the old TBC set (justicar?), and yet this version looks horrid with the awful helm and comedy shoulders.<br />
<br />
So close and yet do very far from being good.<br />
<br />
also, you'll never need to ask a pally how its hanging.....as its ridiculously obvious.....<br />

<br />
Your ''customisation'' was either a pre-determined conclusion based on whatever was your optimal stat, or it was wrong/bad. That is simply an illusion of choice, and not true decision making.<br />
<br />
It's removal will take away none of the complexity or nuances of playing the game, and will take away an unnecessary step of ''getting your gear ready to put on'' besides gemming and enchanting/armour patching.<br />
<br />
But no please, boycott the game based on that lone premise. Tell us more.</div></div><hr />

Reforging =/= Transmog<br />
<br />
Reforging was a pain that didn't offer any sort of customization as there was usually only 1 or 2 stats you would reforge into. Transmog is here to stay, and I would be VERY surprised if they did anything with it.</div></div><hr />

We don't know which of the 'real' people are heading for AltDraenor, outside of a few of them. If Vol'jin and Varian are just sending us across time and space as a heroic invasion force, I'm starting to think we'll either get stuck over there (remember they mentioned that there's still ogre content on the rest of the world) OR when we go through to return and feast for being the saviors... we'll end up on the Azeroth that that draenor would have pointed to if the timeline/universe had gone on as normal. Then boom, WoW 2.0 with all rebooted lore or completely new lore to make if we stay on draenor, plus stat squish for further expansions, plus new models. And 100 is such a pretty number. WoW2.0 starts us back at level 1, wherever it is they finally trap our characters. (maybe we'll be able to carry over our old characters somewhat with a lil bonus, or a feat of strength Veteran of Draenor hooked to our bnet accounts.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This expansion elicits no such excitement. They are rehashing an old world. They are reducing CC in pvp which is great but now you have no bursty burst fun at all. Rehashed old bosses from OUTLAND! OMG! Its Outlands again!<br />
<br />
After seeing blizzard take a fucking huge leap downward in Pandalandapalooza I never figured they would come out with this trash. Only saving grace of this next expansion is the garrisons, we all know that the raids will be the same. Pvp will probably be more fucked up then it is now.</div></div><hr />

If it looks like bullshit, smells like bullshit and sounds like bullshit, it can't be bullshit. Too obvious. Nope, dots snapshot your buffs. That is what Affliction Warlocks' gameplay is centered around. Getting as many buffs as possible and reapplying your dots so they are hella strong and even when your buffs fall off, your dots are still buffed until you reapply them.</div></div><hr />

I really hope its only the buckle, i hated the Wrestler belt models for every damn belt after ICC, the lack of a band makes it look unique and fitting to the theme of the set, and gives it more practicality as an actual belt.</div></div><hr />

So what if it is? It's rebuilt from the ground up (higher resolution would prove that).

<br />
They really should just merge classes into the following: Tank, Healer, Melee DPS, Ranged DPS. <br />
<br />
Tank Skills: Hey Boss Look at Me, Your Mama is so..., Oh Shit!<br />
Healer Skills: Mash Heal Tank, Boss Vomited on Raid Heal, Dumb Ass Raider Standing in Fire Heal<br />
Melee DPS Skills: Stab, Stabby Stab, Stabby Stab McStabs A Lot<br />
Ranged DPS Skills: Magic Missile, Bigger Magic Missile, Even Bigger Magic Missile<br />
<br />
There is one raid buff that happens and is automatically applied to the raid group upon creation called: Super Awesome and it makes all the raiders sparkle as they do stuff.<br />
<br />
In all seriousness, I feel talents are pointless and the class specs do feel very blurred. The idea of different player talent type classes started to die in WotLK. Elemental mages etc...</div></div><hr />

All they are really doing is making less item variations that drop overall. Eventually each item will have 4 stats: &quot;Pew pew power&quot; vitality, armor and haste. Every item will be more similar than ever. They really need to move beyond that +main stat thing and put weird effects on all the items.<br />

<br />
/facepalm....If that's the 'first' of auras outside of pallies you've seen, you must have been gone a long time. Almost every raid buff from dps was made into an aura, including some from others, a LOOONG time ago. Hunter pets now getting them is loooong overdue. I'm not even sure if you're for real or a troll.

The helm looks too much like Transformers ... but I don't have near as much of a gripe with it as I do the shoulders. Like one poster said, it borders on greatness but &amp;F*D8(DF it up with the helm/shoulders. <br />

I'm not amused with the Shield Wall removal for warriors but will patiently await to see how it all unfolds.

So WoW is getting too easy because they're merging abilities together and cutting some to reduce un-necessary bloat, but Wildstar is hard as hell when you only have 8 abilities to use at any one time? I mean don't get me wrong, I've been loving Wildstar too, but flawed logic is flawed.</div></div><hr />

&quot;The Battle Rez idea is quite terrible no offense and will favor smaller groups over larger groups, With 15 people that would be a 6 minute wait for a 2nd rez, a lot of fights have hard enrage timers by the 5-7 minute mark or by then the fight is already over. Even the 4.5 minute mark the fight is pretty much done ...<br />
<br />
Just make it so with 20 people you have a guaranteed 2nd rez, but with 19 people the 2nd charge takes a bit to spawn, like 2 minutes or something and with less people that 2nd charge takes longer to pop up, like with 11 people the 2nd charge takes 6 minutes, 15 people it takes 4 minutes blah blah. waiting almost 5 minutes to get a 2nd battle rez is pretty huge and you might as well wipe instead of waiting especially on hard enrage fights. &quot;<br />

You have know idea what your talking about, Dungeons and raids are much harder in Wildstar, you are clearly talk out your A__, while some of the Pve leveling content is easy, interrupt Armor and the coordination need from a group to time the multiple stacks need to breach said Armor is a very difficult thing to time and coordinate, all while actually having to aim you attacks and Heals is vastly superior to the same old target and Pew Pew method used by most MMO's, I've been in the beta for awhile now and things are still evolving , but the largest complaint right now ,other then the vast amount of bugs, is that the instances are to hard, WoW is starting to become to generic, its quickly moving in to the category of Minecraft, Just for the Kids.</div></div><hr />

They did in another post. Now it will work when your target is either below your max HP or below 10%. So not as wide a range as other execute abilities, but you'll still at least use it once or twice per boss fight instead of it being a gimmick you might get to throw out as a last blow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're not re-using anything. It's built from the ground up, it just intentionally looks very similar.<br />
Did you think they re-used the old MC ragnaros model in Firelands too? That's not how things work.<br />
<br />
I think it looks great, but I've always liked the old T4 set.<br />
<br />
What I really hope is that it's similar enough to the original that I can transmog the original T4 shoulders onto it without them looking too out of place, since the new ones are a bit too flashy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How is this even close to being a &quot;reskin&quot; of some old model? Sure the theme is clearly taken from T4 paladin, but then again, so is the whole expansion a re-imagining of what Draenor is (or was). Basicly it's the same stuff, but &quot;another version of it&quot;. The model itself? Completely new and not a single &quot;re-use&quot; or &quot;reskin&quot;. That being said, I love it and the logic why it looks thematicly the same.<br />

Is all the teir armor going to be revamped outland teir?<br />

Hope so.</div></div><hr />

I really hope they will...TBC had the best looking sets and you can easily confirm this by the transmog people use. <br />
<br />
Warlock T5, T6<br />
Priest T5, T6<br />
Paladin T6<br />
Warrior T5<br />
Mage T5, T6<br />
Rogue T6<br />
<br />
If they can re-produce all this for new character models with better textures then I am all for it :) I just wish they will also include Paladin/Rogue T2, and almost all the Ulduar Tiers hehe<br />

yeap because reforging to hit/expertise cap was a &quot;choice&quot;...or reforging to haste breakpoint was also a &quot;choice&quot;. Not to mention so many sites that loaded your character from armory and told you what to reforge into what and what to enchant..<br />

Yeap, it's another &quot;screw the healers&quot; expansion. Iv'e been there for every rollout, sometimes coming back from a year or more break. Not going through another early-Cata when the only thing you could do was spam your slow, small heal. Looks like the current six months may stretch out indefinitely.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kagecamia</div><div class="date">2014-04-19, 01:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So basically the Healthstones are taken away from Warlocks and given to Mages.<br />
<br />
Not really but if healthstones heal 20% of your hp, and the mage healing cooldown increases all healing to all party members for 6 seconds by 20%, it could effectively be a better cooldown. Healthstones are more of a personal mini heal. You get hit by aoe OR an add? You have a nice heal to help. Amplify magic provides a raid wide healing bonus to everyone. People are low on a healing intensive fight during progression? The mages rotate Amp. Magic with other healers' cds. Just imagine Malkorok blood craze phase if it was at the beginning of the expac. It would be pretty great. You could have close to 100% uptime of this buff during the blood craze phase if every mage monitors and rotates this cooldown.<br />
<br />
It essentially guarantees a raid spot for mages. Mages having been bitching this entire expac that they should have the best damage because they bring the least amount of utility. Given how much people bitched about gateway (despite the fact how it bugs out on a lot of encounters), and the subsequent nerfing to shit regarding its 90 second cd, lock utility has greatly been overnerfed. A nerf to utility and a nerf to damage on the whole for warlocks. <br />
<br />
Remember how gateway and locks were stacked for Lei shen and Iron Qon? I can see a lot of guilds stacking mages at least early in the expac when healing isn't as powerful.<br />
<br />
But hey if blizz wants to fuck over warlocks, that's fine. I've pretty much played my tanks and my mage more than my lock this expac outside of raiding.</div></div><hr />

This expansion elicits no such excitement. They are rehashing an old world. They are reducing CC in pvp which is great but now you have no bursty burst fun at all. Rehashed old bosses from OUTLAND! OMG! Its Outlands again!<br />
<br />
After seeing blizzard take a fucking huge leap downward in Pandalandapalooza I never figured they would come out with this trash. Only saving grace of this next expansion is the garrisons, we all know that the raids will be the same. Pvp will probably be more fucked up then it is now.<br />

Vampiric touch? Or reduced mana costs? If you needed SF or Hymn to keep reliable mana regen before hand, you were doing it wrong. <br />

Yeap I agree, but this changed long before not in Draenor and since we are talking about Draenor I thought your comment was about the Draenor changes. I do also remember talent trees and especially TBC era were hybrid builds were at top :) And beside some popular builds, lot of people were using different builds back then...just for the mage, there was around 4-5 variations of arcane - fire and all were on par and you chosen how you wanna play...melee had weapons specialization, and chosing a weapon had different playstyle...(extra swings, stuns, extra crit).

I think it started when they dumbed down a lot of tanking (at least for me).. Used to love bear tanking in TBC. Then 360 degree swipe and mindless aoe spam :(<br />

<br />
...It's Subjective. It's not the best set in the world mind you but to say objectively aesthetically bad is... well I dunno how I could explain this. It's also Draenei themed.</div></div><hr />

*Retardedly ugly* I don't think you used the term correctly. They never jumped the shark. It's Draenic armor.</div></div><hr />

Subjectivity is a lovely thing.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the games gets dumbed down even further...<br />
Every expansion has introduced more mechanics and abilities.<br />
It's odd how removing bloat and improving/streamlining mechanics is &quot;dumbing down&quot;, especially when we're still far more &quot;advanced&quot; than before.<br />
Tho, it's not like I expect people to ever put things in perspective.<br />
<br />
Don't worry, they have a long, long way left of &quot;dumbing down&quot; left until we're back to steady-shot/kill command auto macros mapped to scrollwheels dominating Recount</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it is,. the removal of glyphs is just one more step down along the ladder of casualization.<br />
<br />
And my scribe is unhappy with this change as well...<br /> 
It was a good money making profession before,. now - not so much.<br />
<br />
Removing Reforging from the game, another step. <br />
<br />
Shall I keep going?<br />
Hah,. they might as well make the game F2P right away, and make people pay money for gear upgrades - that way you know what you're paying for at least ;)<br />
<br />
You can keep defending them all day, there'll always be more people with a different opinion from your own.</div></div><hr />

In order to ease this frustration, we decided to remove or significantly loosen the facing requirements of all attacks that required the player to be behind their target.<br />
<br />
Druid: Ravage no longer requires the Druid to be behind the target.<br />
<br />
Heh so backstabing gameplay is now a frustration? <br />
<br />
<br />
Combo Points for Rogues are now shared across all targets. You no longer lose your Combo Points when switching targets.<br />

<br />
Yep, its a by by rogue for me. <br />

Anyways, nice looking set.</div></div><hr />

Nobody liked inquisition, there's that. A simple dmg modifier to keep up is, simply put, boring like dry crackers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I understand this decision, but am I the only one worried for the pure DPS classes ? (i. e. Rogue, Hunter, Mage and Warlock). Why would you choose one of these classes in your roster instead of an hybrid Tank/DPS/Healer class ?<br />
<br />
Unless a Rogue is absolutely necessary in a group, I see no reason to group one and gear a DPS, instead of a Monk or Druid and have in your group (and potentialy gear up) a DPS, Tank and Healer. As a Hunter, I bring almost nothing to a group besides DPS and buff from other classes, and I don't see why someone will pick a Hunter in their raid / group / team instead of a Shaman. Same thing for Mage and Warlock vs Shadow Priest. Bringing the strict minimum amount of pure DPS, and keeping other DPS spots for a DPS/Healer or DPS/Tank seems to be the better choice.<br />
<br />
Am I missing something ?<br />
<br />
Edit: I missed Spirit and Armor. The resto Druid with his Int/Spirit gear will be a shitty version of a real DPS when he'll switch to a Feral and have Agi/Spirit gear. Same thing for a DPS monk trying to tank without +Armor. Either Spirit and Armor are really really paramount for a Healer / Tank and the statement that &quot;most item will work for all spec of a given class&quot; is wrong, or they are not and pure DPS classes are pretty much fucked.</div></div><hr />

From what I understand, spirit/armor will only be on accessories, which I think means rings, necks, shields and trinkets.<br />
<br />
So the only difference in gear will be 5-6 pieces, making building an off-set easier since you only need a few pieces.</div></div><hr />

imo we should have redesigned version of normal armor just for mythic. people want to be rewarded with cool new look of armor for beating hardest content in game, and you are wrong alot of ppl care about that &quot;color change&quot;</div></div><hr />
