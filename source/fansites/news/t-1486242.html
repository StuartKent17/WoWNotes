Patch 5.4.7 - Arena Rating Changes<br />
We recently implemented a hotfix to address a bug that allowed Personal Ratings to exceed Matchmaking Rating. As a result, some players may notice that they do not gain or lose Personal Rating in the wake of a match. As more matches are played, these ratings will normalize and converge to the correct rating, and Personal Rating will then rise or drop accordingly.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we will continue to monitor the situation and make further adjustments if necessary.<br />

Make-A-Wish® Charity Pet: Thank You!<br />
Thanks to the epic outpouring of generosity from World of Warcraft players around the world who purchased an Alterac Brew Pup pet, we’ve raised $1 million to benefit Make-A-Wish in their continuing efforts to grant the wishes of children throughout the world with life-threatening medical conditions.<br />
<br />
Last November, we announced (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/blog/11704540) that 50% of the Alterac Brew Pup’s $10 purchase price would be donated to Make-A-Wish, and the WoW community rushed in to lend their support. Thanks again for helping to make a difference in the lives of children.<br />

Hello, can you please answer one question? Are you done with our group Darksorrow/Genjuros/Neptulon or you are planning to add more realms?<br />
Yes we're done with that group for now.<br />
<br />
Was wondering if the Darkmoon Faire/Earthen Ring connection means we will have a 2 way and a 3 way connection of the smaller 5 RP realms (as opposed to the 5 way most were expecting).<br />
Still waiting to see how things pan out, but we're not currently planning to add more realms to the Darkmoon Faire/Earthen Ring connection.<br />
<br />
Ok, I have to ask because the wait is driving me crazy; Will Steamwheedle Cartel ever get connected?<br />
Current plans are to connect it, yes. But as I always stress, nothing is set in stone; we have to carefully analyse how things go as we proceed<br />
<br />
Thats a shame really.. I seen server be merged into fives.. that would help the 5 minor Role Play servers if they became one. Seems a lot are hoping for this to happen.<br />
Connecting all five of the EN RP realms would result in mild queues at quiet times for players on those realms, and hours of waiting to log on at busy times<br />
<br />
Would it really be the case if all except AD were connected, it'd make queues? I always thought all except AD were suffering in a minor way.<br />
You're right, apologies, I edited my post to clarify I was talking about the low/medium population realms. Argent Dawn often has queues by itself so it won't be connected to any others. But yeah as I said, the others aren't as small as, say, some of the PvP ones we've been connecting.<br />
<br />
<br />

New World of Warcraft Short Story: The Untamed Valley<br />
In Pandaria’s Valley of the Four Winds, modest farmers have worked the land for generations. They are the true backbone of Pandaren society, feeding an empire with an honest day’s work...scant preparation for war.<br />
<br />
Though Garrosh Hellscream has been defeated, the flames of his hatred still rage in the hearts of his followers. When the worst of these descend on Pandaria, closely followed by Alliance heroes Maraad and Lyalia, the humble Tillers find their farms transformed into battlefields.<br />
The Tillers are committed to their homes and the earth they cultivate, but will they give up their lives to protect them? Worse, will they give up their lives for nothing?<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/march/newStory.jpg (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/destination-pandaria/faction-stories/untamed-valley/1) <br />
<br />
The answer is in the 7th Pandaria faction story, “The Untamed Valley (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/destination-pandaria/faction-stories/untamed-valley/1),” written by Robert Brooks. It’s available now on the Destination: Pandaria (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/game/lore/#destination-pandaria/) site as a free download. Enjoy!</div></div><hr />

Yeah that makee sense. It also means that there is a possibility of updated rigs with more elaborate animation. Same deal with chimeras. The iron skyreaver mount is a likely prototype. (like heart of the aspects)<br />

Also means we may get an iron chimera boss encounter.</div></div><hr />

I've officially given up on SWC now, waited long enough for blizz to pull their heads out of their asses and connect our dead realm. So now I feel I have 2 choices, either un-sub and wait until it is connected or pay £15 and move my main to another far busier realm.</div></div><hr />

Yeah but this isn't the first time they do this kind of fixes e.g culling of stratholme, which means they agree that not being able to rush through a dungeon can become a little exasperating if the party is largely overgeared. Also the gong was already made and live, they just needed to enable it in heroic mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You know I did this too back in mid-WOTLK.. but sometime in late Cata I wished I had him back since we had more stable slots. I asked a GM (didn't remember what I named it either) and he actually found it and restored it to me.</div></div><hr />

That's close to printing money right away....<br />
<br />
it really is amazing when you think about it. I would guess most MMOs have not made that much all year.<br />
<br />
Blizzard really has created a ´must capture´ mentality for the pets similar to the stuffed bears back in the 80s. I have collected every pet in game, have all the TCG one (bought ingame with gold) as well as all the cash-shop pets ( also bought with ingame gold)... and I even have a couple of collector edition pets from some of the WOW expansions. With all that, there are still a thousand people with more pets than me just listed on a website where you need to voluntarily sign up!<br />
<br />
Of course Blizzard has to contain themselves, and they have been releasing cash-shop pets slowly enough so it isn´t annoying.. I also don´t know how much work that goes into it, but I can´t imagine it would take a person more than a week to do one, especially since almost all of them are based off different models.</div></div><hr />

So basically Blizzard got everyone to donate $2 Million to them, which they then gave half of to Make-A-Wish, which is a tax write-off, so, yeah, basically $2 million for Blizzard. For what was probably two weeks worth of an animator/modeler's work time. Yeah, charity or not, let that sink in a tiny bit. And it still takes 5-6 months between patches and an entire year+ for a new expansion. #classy #cynical</div></div><hr />

Yer absolutely right. They should have made the product, sold it and kept all the money for themselves like a real American corporation should g'dammit!! #chewtabaccy #bush4evah</div></div><hr />

Because like everything Blizz does, they want to get it right before they release it. <br />
<br />
The real question is why, if they're going to bother telling us they don't want the final content patch to stagnate for an inordinate amount of time again, they didn't plan enough content for MoP, or at least space it out more, to last until WoD could reasonably be expected to at least be approaching beta status. They should have a pretty good handle on how long their development process takes by now, so why do they still keep dropping the ball with the end of every expansion?</div></div><hr />

It is an objective and factual impossibility for the content in an MMO - any MMO, not just WoW - to be produced faster than it can be consumed, because the playerbase will always outnumber the developers.</div></div><hr />

Nobody argues with that. It's simply that basically more then 6 months of no new content in any form starts to irk people. Bliz knows this and they promised not to have a gap like the end of previous expansions. Yet they will now again have over a year of no content, in fact the longest wait period at any point of WoW's history.<br />
<br />
We don't expect a continuous supply of content that keeps up with the top 100 guilds or so. We just want regular patches spaced enough for average gamers to not get bored while still able to enjoy the content to the fullest. Sure an expansion content can take a bit longer, especially if there's a beta phase where people can take a look around. But over a year means tons of people will get bored and unsubscribe.</div></div><hr />
