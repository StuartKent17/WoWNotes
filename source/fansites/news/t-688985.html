I also want to point out that there isn't a lot of Season 8 information to datamine, a lot of people sent me messages to ask for a preview of the season 8 gear but ... it's just not in the game files for the moment. This is also why the patch can't be deployed later than January 26th, the files needed to start the arena season are here, hopefully Blizzard will be nice enough to post a preview of the Season 8 armor sets. <br />

Important - Armory Scams<br />
The new version of the armory is now available on both US (http://www.wowarmory.com) and EU (http://eu.wowarmory.com) armory and a lot of people lost their account because of scammers exploiting the popularity of the armory. The scam is fairly simple, people buy advertising on Google to display ads pointing to fake armory sites when you search for the real one on google. <br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/january/armoryscam.jpg (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/january/armoryscam.jpg)<br />
<br />
NEVER, EVER, EVER, EVER use google to access the official site or the armory, just type http://www.wowarmory.com (http://www.wowarmory.com) / http://eu.wowarmory.com (http://eu.wowarmory.com) in your browser and bookmark it if you're lazy and don't want to type it every time. <br />
<br />
The armory now requires you to login for a lot of the features introduced with the latest upgrade and you should make sure that you do not do anything stupid when you access it. I don't think you would use google to go to your Account Management page. <br />
<br />
If you think you might have been scammed by one of these pages, change your password immediately. If you do not think that you're concerned by this post, change your password immediately because it's always a good idea anyway. <br />

Blue posts<br />
Resilience change in next season<br />
As far as the resilience change I mentioned yesterday we're considering making goes, we only plan to adjust the way it affects damage done by players, not increase the critical hit reduction component.<br />
<br />
Just to reiterate for those expressing concerns about healing becoming too dominant if a buff to resilience goes live, we share this same concern. We do not want to drastically increase the length of fights or make them too healer dominant if damage is toned down. We've been saying this all along.

Ashen Verdict Ring - Strength DPS Ring<br />
We are still planning to add the strength ring in the next minor content patch. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/22419028344-ashen-verdict-rings.html))<br />
<br />
Zone-Wide buff in later versions of Icecrown Citadel<br />
You will be able to choose to NOT use the zonewide buff for whatever that's worth to you. So it seems your battle pride may remain intact. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/12/22418976253-stealth-buffing-p3-put-is-kind-of-a--move.html))<br />

Lich King Screenshot Contest Winners<br />
Many adventurers have begun a siege upon the Scourge in Northrend, besting the Lich King's corrupted allies in places like Howling Fjord and Zul'Drak, weakening his stronghold in Icecrown, and ascending through the twisting corridors of his citadel to lay waste to his most vile creatures and top commanders. The bravest of heroes have captured pictures to document the rise and impending fall of the Lich King, from their first steps into Icecrown Citadel’s hidden entrance into the Forge of Souls, to busting directly through the front gates of Icecrown Citadel.<br />
<br />
We've selected the very best of these screenshots to offer each creator an Epic Edition Rise of the Lich King stein created by Taverncraft (http://wowsteins.com). We also congratulate our grand prize winner, James Hessler, who will receive the signed #1 of only 750 Legendary Edition Rise of the Lich King steins! Have a look at all of the winning screenshots here: http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/contests/09-12-lich-king/winners.html<br />

It's likely going to have exactly the same hit/crit values as the current Agility ring to ensure that every plate DPS can make equal use of it.<br />

Makes my paladin so awesome to get a useless stat thrown all over my gear that when cata comes out, will be competely gone.

<br />
<br />
Gah. Stellarily bad advice there.<br />
<br />
What if someone goes to a fake armory site enough times so that entry in FireFox quick entry bar thingy is pointy to a faker armory site ?<br />
<br />
Also I find the advice to &quot;just install &lt;insert name addon&gt; and you won't have to worry about googling the wrong one&quot; bad as well as you're essentially relying on other people to update a scam site list.<br />
<br />
Here's an idea for you.<br />
<br />
Don't google the Armory at all.<br />
<br />
You know the worldofwarcraft.com site is definitely owned by Blizzard right? (run a whois search if you're not sure)<br />
<br />
Go there look at the top right hand side of that web page there'll be a set of 3 links.<br />
<br />
Armory is the middle link in that set of links.<br />
<br />
It's also at the top of every world of warcraft forums page.<br />
<br />
No googling , firefox or unusually furry addons required.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bluspacecow</div><div class="date">2010-01-15, 03:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Woops forgot to point this out as well guys :<br />
<br />
If you are currently logged into the forums then you don't need to login into the Armory.<br />
<br />
Blizzard just takes your cookie that tells your browser you are logged into the forums and uses that to log you into the Armory.<br />
<br />
So if you've logged into the forums , you go to the PROPER armory and you click the login thingy up the top it automatically logs you in.<br />
<br />
And no point should it ask you for your username and password if already logged into the forums.<br />
<br />
Of course if your battle.net cookie has expired you will need to login again - at either a https://us.battle.net address or a https://eu.battle.net<br />
<br />
These 2 domains are also owned by Blizzard - I've run a whois on both and both are owned by Blizzard Entertainment</div></div><hr />

(The real armory wouldn't load because after a format I forgot to set No Script in firefox to allow the real site) When I went to search, firefox stated that it was a malicious site and forwarded it in a report.<br />

Upon searching google again it seems that another one has popped up, and further inspection is kind of lol as they mispelled warcraft and spelled it warcrnaft.<br />

<br />
&quot;Sponsored By Google&quot; means that the company paid Google to be put at the top of the list when certain search terms are used, instead of being at the top because of the usual search algorithm. It's a code term that essentially means &quot;paid advertisement&quot;. Google's entire business model is in these advertisements. When you're looking for a site to purchase items from &quot;Sponsored by Google&quot; entries can be quite helpful, but when you are looking for information you should take them with a grain of salt.</div></div><hr />

I was about to say that as well. Almost all scam sites are from the Chinese. Seriously, just cut them off from the world and we'd be a lot safer.

I work in the IT industry as a web developer for a university, and I'm hearing reports left and right of major companies and schools all blocking traffic from those countries (among others like Poland and many other South-East Asia countries) because hackers almost 99.9% of the time are from there. When will the world see that people from Russia or China just aren't good people? At least, they have a much higher concentration of bad people, that is.

The new version of the armory is now available on both US (http://www.wowarmory.com) and EU (http://eu.wowarmory.com) armory and a lot of people lost their account because of scammers exploiting the popularity of the armory. The scam is fairly simple, people buy advertising on Google to display ads pointing to fake armory sites when you search for the real one on google. <br />

That may be true for someone who dont care about money and profits. Many companies just could not afford to lose those markets, the cost is too much for them... large enough for them to take the risk.<br />

It's not just naive people. An average person really won't know that those stuff are paid advertisements and would just trust Google.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">oddigy</div><div class="date">2010-01-15, 09:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">To gain some insight on the surprising number of individuals disclosing their account information to evildoers unknowingly, you need to take some things into consideration:<br />
<br />
- The vast majority of PC users use the system only as a tool. They are not expected nor encouraged to know what goes on under the hood. This does not mean education is futile, it just means that we can't expect everyone to be online security prodigies out of the box. <br />
<br />
- With this in mind, most people do not read things with checkmarks next to them. This means when they install Adobe Reader, or Java Virtual Machine, or potentially lots of other free, common distributed software, they will find themselves with seemingly innocuous &quot;stowaways&quot; on their computers including, but not limited to GOOGLE TOOLBAR.<br />
<br />
- Google Toolbar provides a little search box at the top of the browser window which is suspiciously close to the Address Bar.<br />
<br />
- Typing a URL into the Google Search bar does not tell your browser to directly navigate to that site. Instead, it will display a Google Search results page. This may seem uncommon, but based on my experience (over 10 years working in the service industry as a fire extinguisher for churches and small profit organizations) more people than you think will be typing URLs in here.<br />
<br />
<br />
This is likely how people have been coming up with those phishing links. The quick answer to this is to install FireFox and AdBlock Plus. It's a pipe dream though, as most PC users will exclusively use Internet Explorer, as that's what comes with their system by default, and there is no problem with that.<br />
<br />
As was previously mentioned, I am seeing people who are extremely skeptical and intelligent falling for these phishing schemes. The #1 failsafe way to keep your stuff safe is to get an Authenticator. I'd advise everyone gets one ASAP.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard should just nerf hackers. ;-)<br />
<br />
Or give all users the &quot;Authenticator&quot; buff.<br />
<br />
Honestly though, I find blue posts describing Blizzard's reasoning behind not requiring every WoW account to use an authenticator, rather weak. Using multi-factor authentication of which one factor is an inconstant value protected by cryptographic time-sensitive algorithms is fairly strong in my opinion... and if every WoW player were using an authenticator, a lot of the scams - and scammers - in the game would go away.<br />
<br />
&quot;New WoW Feature x available now! Login to www.wowhackmetohellandgone.com, and send us your account authenticator in the post to be eligible for a preview!&quot;... Yeah, I see that working. ;-)</div></div><hr />

I've known several people who simply bought the authenticator, then didn't register it, thinking that all they needed to do is have it near their computer.<br />

Blizzard is understandably cautious about requiring an authenticator to play the game. Requiring it brings up two scenarios:<br />
<br />
Scenario 1:<br />
Blizzard requires the authenticator to be used in order to play. They make a limited-time offer available for their paying customers to get one for free (we'll say a month's time for the sake of argument). Everyone (those who pay attention) gets their free authenticator, follows the simple instructions on how to set it up with their account (they won't be able to play otherwise), and everyone is happy. Blizzard is happy because they don't have to devote as much manpower and money to restoring lost accounts, items, gold, etc. It's less time and money spent trying to stamp out issues like the Google search we've been discussing. The players are happy because they can surf the wolrd wied webz without fear of having their account compromised. The only person who loses out are the people and companies that make a living off of stealing accounts and gold.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2:<br />
Blizzard requires the authenticator to be used in order to play. They do NOT make them available for free to paying customers. The inevitable backlash comes from their customer base over being forced to purchase $7 worth of peace of mind. Some of the customer base leaves the game and cancels their subscription (a good 25% of them will be back in short order, but that's not the point of this discussion). Those folks who already have the authenticator, and those folks who purchased it after it was made mandatory, are happy because they can now watch goat-on-monkey porn with no risk of having their account compromised. The scammers and account thieves are miserable because their main source of income and business has disappeared. Blizzard is happy because they don't have to devote as much manpower and money to restoring lost accounts, items, gold, etc.<br />
<br />
With Scenario 1, the worst problem is that Blizzard makes an investment in their player base by giving out the authenticators. In the quantity that Blizzard purchases these in, and with the stated fact that the price of the authenticator is to cover shipping costs, this is NOT a big investment for such a huge return in money and manpower. What they spend on free authenticators they will most likely make back in saved manpower and costs.<br />
<br />
With Scenario 2, Blizzard takes a calculated risk. They don't spend the money on the free authenticators, banking on their customer base to accept it and buy them. Blizz knows they're going to lose some customers over the decision; again, the saved manpower and costs may (or may not) counterbalance that and leave Blizzard in the green.<br />
<br />
The common issue with both of these scenarios is that, even if in both of them the conversion to an authenticator-required login system is completely accepted, Blizzard is now going to have to spend time and money on customer support for the damn things. How many calls/emails a day does Blizzard get for lost authenticators? Questions about how to set them up (when they come with an instruction sheet a blind man could follow)? Then you run into people saying 'I have four accounts, and I have to use four separate authenticators?! BLASPHEMY!' (without taking the time to read and know that, yes, you can configure a single authenticator to multiple accounts). The time and money they saved by eliminating the theft of accounts is now being devoted, at least for the time-being, to customer support and service in regards to the new authenticator system.<br />
<br />
Damned if they do, damned if they don't. It's no wonder they haven't jumped on the idea of making authenticators required, provided for free or not.</div></div><hr />
