Patch 6.2 - Updated Demon Models<br />
Patch 6.2 finally updates many of the old demon models. Warlocks only use the new Doomguard model and the rest of their pets are still the old demon models.<br />

Flying Feedback<br />
&quot;Didn't listen&quot; doesn't = &quot;didn't implement.&quot; Designing is a group activity, what I want may not matter in the end, but I read your post. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602731018454474753))<br />
I think it's a slight misnomer and most are looking for discussion. Only implementing and saying why feels a bit dismissive.<br />
Understood. While I can't offer much for discussion, hopefully it's a small comfort that at least their posts are read/voices heard. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602735326927421440))<br />
<br />
Mr. Feasel, ask yourself why you disagree that much with many of your players. Do you still think you adress them?<br />
I may not disagree with you at all. I don't make all of the decisions (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602738898515689472))<br />
<br />
Thanks again for the continued feedback. Still here, still listening, (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602725757471821825))<br />
&quot;Thanks for the feedback&quot; is becoming the wowdev version of &quot;umadbro&quot;<br />
If I didn't want people to continue providing feedback, I wouldn't have posted anything at all (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602726643757625344))<br />
feedback is useful with two-sided communication, and you (as a team) are still too quiet<br />
I can't speak for anyone but myself, but I think it's important to note that I'm reading all of the responses. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602729337847160832))<br />
Would be nice to get the actual reasoning behind decisions instead of snark. A good start is &quot;I'll mention it next meeting.&quot;<br />
I never take a piece of feedback lightly. Every Voice Matters. However, I can't talk about internal goings-on. Apologies. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602732501807804416))<br />
Sometimes seeing &quot;I hear everything&quot; feels impersonal. Maybe see if you can get a public facing response to some &quot;no&quot; decisions?) <br />
Usually the next product or patch addresses issues, we live in interesting times with instant communication. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602734665657688064))<br />
<br />
If you're going to announce a major feature being removed indefinitely, an interview isn't the place. Perhaps the main website?<br />
Curious why you feel that way. An interview on a major press site will likely be seen by more players. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/602219738681475072))<br />
<br />
you realize most of the post has turned into just flaming you guys because months of real feedback was ignored right?<br />
There is a massive difference between &quot;ignored&quot; and &quot;disagreed with.&quot; (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/602271343850184704))<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Selfie Contest Confusion<br />
Hello! Yes we've been working on this for the last few hours after running into an issue with the page not resetting people's entries for the new week. As a solution we're going to be creating a new weekly entry page for each week's challenge that will be specifically for that week. When a new week is available it'll be a new page. To help make that easy for you we're going to constantly update the blizz.ly URL we've been using to always point to the current week's entry page: http://blizz.ly/WoWSelfie <br />
<br />
If you did clear your browser and already entered don't worry, your entry is saved, but if you'd like to enter again on the new page there's no penalty, we'll just delete the duplicate. We'll be closing what will be the 'week 1 page' here shortly.<br />
<br />
Thanks for your patience, and good luck! (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/374327-selfie-contest-confusion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/17605531516?page=1#12))<br />
<br />
Iron Man Challenge Stats<br />
I have a few convoluted ways of detecting whether a character has equipped certain restricted gear for the Iron Man challenge, however, I would love to be able to just look at their statistics at a character level<br />
Done. Check out the next PTR build - there should be visible character-specific statistics available to track this information. (Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/en/forum/topic/17532853244#2))<br />
<br />
<br />
Vanilla Servers<br />
I would come back to wow in a heartbeat if blizz made vanilla servers. I would love to experience it all again. By the way I don't mean this as a knock to current WOW, it's just something I would find incredibly fun.<br />
I think the biggest challenges for an idea like this are a) would it be interesting enough to keep playing, and b) would there be enough sustained interest from other players to make the world feel alive. I could easily see the outcome being people logging in, going &quot;wow the game is so much better now,&quot; and logging out. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601498462488768512))<br />
IMO seeing how popular uh &quot;theoretical&quot; vanilla servers seem to be, I would say there is at least some demand.<br />
Sure, there's definitely interest, even internally. We just don't think there's enough to offset the costs. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601524617916882944))<br />
Personally, I'd 100% expect it to be something almost everyone just pokes at for a week or two and then drops. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601525079705526272))<br />
Not really an effective use of time for devs who could be working on any number of features for the live game. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601525289139773440))<br />
Speaking for myself, I'd love to go back and poke at classic. I just don't think I'd play it for long. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601524617916882944))<br />
Or, the devs could just 'go back to the core roots', as it were. Yep, especially the class designs, every class used to be fun, but in WoD.<br />
If that's the case, I think we'd rather focus on fixing the modern game. (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/601525761363816448))<br />
<br />
<br />
Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
Developer Communication<br />
While I didn't always agree with what you had to say, i, at-least, appreciated that you took the time to say it.<br />
Thanks. I figure at least then players can argue whether we aren't hitting our goals or if the goals themselves are bad. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599702877553098753))<br />
<br />
We miss you dearly GC. @WatcherDev and his team are alienating @Warcraft players with their hubris. <br />
Whether you like every decision or not, I am confident they have your best interests in mind. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/602157807983468544))<br />
<br />
Game Design<br />
If I was going to make an MMO (I'm not) I think I'd shoot for something episodic with the expectation players come and go. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599280079118536704))<br />
How does the social aspect play into that, though? Sounds like it would be hell on guilds.<br />
I agree, but I think players are episodic already so the business model might as well be. Social hard either way. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599364332313411585))<br />
Was there ever a time where that wasn't the case? Is it a more prominent problem today versus 2007?<br />
I *think* so (?). A lot of games, LoL among them, are huge. They try to be the only game you need. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599703266117558272))<br />
Which means ironically we tend to drop games as soon as we hit diminishing returns b/c there is so much else out there. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599703579977322496))<br />
<br />
What you say you prefer and what you actually did ended complete opposite.<br />
I was a lead designer not a dictator. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599599928533389312))<br />
<br />
It stopped being fun when my hunter was mocked for not pulling over 100k dps. That was a year ago. #NoEpeen<br />
I wish we had been more progressive about trying to curb bad behavior. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599671373196185600))<br />
I wish so, too. I would never raid because of all the bs. But i have some awesome rare hunter pets <br />
One secret is to turn off chat (in any game). That is pretty much their only tool in being a tool. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599702565152886784))<br />
<br />
The game has too much math and has lost the adventure part. ilvl has ruined the fantasy journey of azeroth. Players couldnt see item ilvl back then. There was no need for perfect dpsrotations in molten core. It was an adventure<br />
I don't think it was ilvl per se. There was just less shared knowledge, which makes sense for a younger game in the 2000s. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/600010013453656064))<br />
Most of us didn't approach *any* game back then with &quot;How do I min/max this? What is the best spec?&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/600010146689875968))<br />
We played the characters we chose and when our guilds ventured into MC we used what we had. Alts were rarer in those days too. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/600010343104925696))<br />
<br />
Do you think WoW should have more exclusivity - like it did back in the old days? BC<br />
Exclusivity works when it's stacked on top of normal content (not replacing it) which just means you need more content. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599573635993481217))<br />
I was under the impression that Exclusivity was an integral part of why MMO's were successful in the first place.<br />
I think so. But you can't have special content for the elite and nothing for everyone else. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/600537150363336705))<br />
<br />
I didn't start WoW until 2007. I recall lots of fun times since, screencaps from most of them, others just memories in brain.<br />
I remember the feelings so vividly. I don't think you can recapture them though. (This is also true of most of life, sadly.) (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/599026254411538432))<br />

<br />
Looking at the vanilla (not the other expansions) private servers, there aren't very many online. If you put them all together, maybe 50,000 (no specific numbers, grabbing them out of my own experiences). That's nothing compared to what live WoW has right now. Let's say they open a vanilla server, and 300,000 starts playing there regulary. Not a very high number. The numbers will also drop, cause in the end there is not much to do. The only reason people stayed in World of Warcraft was because The Burning Crusade came out, followed by other expansions with new content.<br />
I feel like Blizzard should rather focus on their live game instead of going back to the past. That's what we have the private servers for anyway.</div></div><hr />

If you put them all together, maybe 50,000 (no specific numbers, grabbing them out of my own experiences). That's nothing compared to what live WoW has right now. Let's say they open a vanilla server, and 300,000 starts playing there regulary. Not a very high number. The numbers will also drop, cause in the end there is not much to do. The only reason people stayed in World of Warcraft was because The Burning Crusade came out, followed by other expansions with new content.<br />
I feel like Blizzard should rather focus on their live game instead of going back to the past. That's what we have the private servers for anyway.<br />
<br />
your numbers are purely out of imagination i guess ^^ Do you even know how many players are online on a &quot;Normal&quot; blizzard server/realm on average? With those numbers the realm would be full all the time, just saying :) They should atleast open one in US and one in EU, and run it for some time and see if its something that sticks.</div></div><hr />

Odd as it sounds, if we were playing the same game now that we were playing in vanilla, I wouldn't mind not having flying. Ground mounts were far less painful in a world that had a more open terrain. All these ground mazes and jumping puzzles are fine the first time. Doing them for every single archaeology fragment at a digsite... not so much.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a vanilla WoW server with some kind of progression of expansions over time would also be extremely popular just like it has been in EQ. You don't need millions of people playing it, just enough people to fill one server worth of community. I bet there are easily enough for that - In fact the server would probably be packed.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not everyone shares your train of thought, either. Then again, not everyone sees an opinion they disagree with it and labels it as &quot;whiny&quot; or &quot;entitled&quot; simply because it's a view different from their own. Some are perfectly capable of instead seeing something they disagree with, stating as much, and providing a counterpoint. &quot;You're an entitled whiny shit,&quot; isn't a counterpoint. It only says, &quot;They like something I don't like, and I'm going to call them names, now.&quot; I get it. Entitled whiny shits are bad. Entitled whiny shits who whine about entitled whiny shits are worse.<br />
<br />
At least the folks who like flying are for the most part capable of stating why they want it back. Heck, most are even fine with not having flying during the leveling process and having flight linked to an achievement of some sort so that they can experience the game from the ground, first. They are, after all, paying money for the game. Telling the company what they're looking for in a product they'll buy isn't unheard of. It's expected and far from &quot;whiny.&quot; Further, when you pay for a product and what something you'll have fun with for your money-- particularly something that they were told would be eventually added into the expansion they purchased (http://www.wowhead.com/news=223780/no-flying-in-draenor-until-6-1)-- that doesn't make you &quot;entitled.&quot;<br />
<br />
If you pay for a bacon and egg biscuit and you're given a plain biscuit, going to the counter and asking that they give you what you asked for doesn't make you entitled or whiny.<br />
<br />
And now I just want a damn biscuit.</div></div><hr />

Cataclysms heroic dungeon problem was they designed a dungeon with the difficulty of what an organized group could handle, and then opened it up for LFG. Chaos ensued. I blame the LFG system entirely for all the rage that happened at the start of Cata. LFG should have been kept to normal modes only. <br />
<br />
The dungeons themselves were amazing - those heroics at the beginning of Cata were the best 5 man group content in WoW since Strath and Scholomance back in 2004/5.</div></div><hr />

and any mmorpg can take the cue and provide their players with gravity guns and other promises too. I for one welcome our new flying gravity gun overlords. In other words: by all means, if a studio thinks they can deliver on a full 3d, all axis, flying based mmorpg, I will even give it a try.

Sure i have. And while i get what you mean, it's a whole other matter to have the support of the original company that produces the game, than a private server. In fact people avoid private servers because many things (some p2w, not bug-free content, scripting not even close to the original , just to name some).<br />

They're pretty right about it. Of the 5 guild mates dead set on playing on a highly rated vanilla server, they give up that shit before level 20. Their rose colored glasses certainly shattered reading their experiences on playing it again.<br />

<br />
Been playing since vanilla on my warrior. I loved vanilla, with all its difficulties and a complete lack of QOL features. TBC came in with its brutal dungeons and flying. I loved them all even the flying as it was fresh. Next came WotL. Again I loved it with its intruduction of some decent QOL features. the story goes on up to today were we have no flying and again i am loving the expansion. I would not want to go back to vanilla. There is no way they could recreate the same feel.<br />
<br />
My point being that jumping from one xpac to another always freshened the game and kept it relevant to me. Flying did come to a point of lift off - travel - land - kill 1 mob - lift off. They have put effort to improve movement from one map to another and even added toys to boost in map travel. The flow of game kept relevant and smooth.<br />
<br />
For me its a constant game improvement and hope they proceed with their plans (that is no flyign and improve temporary movement and flight paths).<br />
<br />
Just to add feedback on how maybe they could implement flight for the ppl that miss it. It needs some cool down or fatigue system that does not allow you to constantly bypass content. It needs to be restricted and done drastically if re-introduced. Like an example for every 1 min flight you need 15 min cool down in a form of a meter. I mean in a form of a meter as in you have 100 energy and for it to go from 0 to 100 it needs 15 minutes. Then you are free to spend the 100 energy as you wish. This is just a format and value should change to mimic the current toys that alow temp flight ingame in WOD.</div></div><hr />

Some times skills aren't working or they are tweaked according to the &quot;privates&quot; taste...usually with not good results. <br />
The reason I say TBC or even end game WotLK is that PvP was way more balanced than now or MoP or even Cata... as for PvE they will introduce timewalking and we will eventually get do Old things again with challenge. The thing they can't do is the &quot;uniqueness&quot; classes/specs had in the past. And that is what WoW is missing. Hell if they could mod TBC/WotLK with current graphics (it would be easier for them to stay in the current ...upgraded(?) engine(?)...) i believe more people will play those servers than Trashran /Farmerama/selfies and stuff...<br />
I tell you, whoever player plays privates atm...he will pay and he will play if they make some servers. He will find the difference in quality convincing enough to pay...</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;scripting not even close to the original &quot;<br />
wrong, depends on the server, some provide extremely high quality and dont release bugged content until its scripted,<br />
currently wotlk servers are the most promising, close to 100% blizzlike content (eg. polish sunwell), dont believe? start playing</div></div><hr />

Chaos ensued. I blame the LFG system entirely for all the rage that happened at the start of Cata. LFG should have been kept to normal modes only. <br />
<br />
The dungeons themselves were amazing - those heroics at the beginning of Cata were the best 5 man group content in WoW since Strath and Scholomance back in 2004/5.<br />
<br />
I agree on this. Running those heroic dungeons with friends/guildies was the best 5-man content i've experienced in Wow. Also remember doing the dungeon hero of xxxx achievement back then felt great as accomplishment. Really against the dumbing down of dungeons these days ...</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think a vanilla WoW server with some kind of progression of expansions over time would also be extremely popular just like it has been in EQ. You don't need millions of people playing it, just enough people to fill one server worth of community. I bet there are easily enough for that - In fact the server would probably be packed.<br />
<br />
I played back in vanilla so get me guess what you saying want to play again all expansions?<br />
Done that already. So no thank you. Even with its flaws and vanilla had them even if most don't want to admit it. I liked it but it's time to look to the future and not to the past. Let's concentrate and try go press blizzard to actually get to the point where they really cared for the game and had a dev team with passion for it.<br />

Sure, there's definitely interest, even internally. We just don't think there's enough to offset the costs. (CM_Lore)<br />
<br />
Make one server , you got the files (i'm sure there is archive) you got nothing to do only drop the next patch some eventual time , you dont need to fix shit you dont need to create anything , just keep it runing and if people overpopulate it make another .<br />
<br />
Personally, I'd 100% expect it to be something almost everyone just pokes at for a week or two and then drops. (CM_Lore)<br />
<br />
Yea cuz we are so into poking garisons atm , you know the &quot;Fun&quot; , but we cant drop it cuz nothing else to do , its the Garrison expansion . Then again at least we got raids :D<br />
<br />
Not really an effective use of time for devs who could be working on any number of features for the live game. (CM_Lore)<br />
<br />
So what are you deving on already compleated patch and versions , we want it the same , not the w/e you want to change it to . Its just change from one patch to another , you are not creating anything new .<br />
<br />
Speaking for myself, I'd love to go back and poke at classic. I just don't think I'd play it for long. (CM_Lore)<br />
<br />
One thing you said right ... your opinion :D As a person that have both blizzard and playing private servers just to get vanilla/tbc expiriance i can tell you tons of bugs , but most of the time its awesome .</div></div><hr />

<br />
I'm almost certain that if they launched a server from scratch and released a new raid every time someone cleared the previous (MC open by default, BWL open when server first MC is accomplished), the whole WoW scene would see a crazy boost. <br />
<br />
Why do i say this?:<br />
- Current raiders would want to assert themselves in WoW's prime content.<br />
- Ex WoW players would return to relive fond memories.<br />
- The juicy vein that is all the young people who didnt get to play Vanilla/TBC/WotLK would have their shot at partaking in the fun.<br />
- The playerbase has evolved so much. In Vanilla almost every raider clicked all their spells (no1 really entertained the idea of optimizing your combat rotation), backpeddling was used far too much, voice com was rare and despite popular belief the game was not as active as it is today. <br />
- The people who are lured back to WoW or to play WoW for the very first time will eventually, likely, end up playing the latest expansion when the first Vanilla (TBC -&gt; WotLK, etc) cycle has taken its turn.<br />
- Blizzard might learn something.<br />

If you put them all together, maybe 50,000 (no specific numbers, grabbing them out of my own experiences). That's nothing compared to what live WoW has right now. Let's say they open a vanilla server, and 300,000 starts playing there regulary. Not a very high number. The numbers will also drop, cause in the end there is not much to do. The only reason people stayed in World of Warcraft was because The Burning Crusade came out, followed by other expansions with new content.<br />
I feel like Blizzard should rather focus on their live game instead of going back to the past. That's what we have the private servers for anyway.<br />
<br />
How many people are online on a private server compared to a real server doesn't matter though. The only thing that matters is if it's profitable. I'm not the biggest fan of the idea of a vanilla server either. I believe they had to buff the shit out of a lot of things on the biggest one because people just steamrolled most raids since they were so easy for example. If Blizzard did that it wouldn't really be a real vanilla server anymore, and it would also require a lot of time on their side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't see Blizzard going back on their boneheaded decision though, they are simply seeing how much time they can save if they stop creating content with flying in mind and keep to designing it for people with the attention-spans of goldfish. Bye bye, zones like Storm Peaks and Icecrown and Jade Forest...<br />

<br />
How can it be &quot;asserting&quot; to go back and raid content that has less mechanics to it than most DUNGEON bosses have today? Going back to relive nostalgia is one thing, but as someone only having raided since WOTLK I would much rather spend my time raiding Mythic content of today than 10 year old content with snoozefest mechanics. I see those raids every week anyways as I solo for transmog gear. <br />
<br />
One thing that could be fun with a Classic-only server would be to go back, beat the content, and forever shut up the people acting as if it presented the pinnacle of challenge that players arriving in later expansions couldn't handle even if they tried. ^^</div></div><hr />

I have to disagree with this point. There were 8 million players at the start of WotLK in the US and EU. Since then they added 20 servers in the US alone and lost 900k players while expanding into at least 4 other markets. US and EU servers are absolutely less active than they were at the end of TBC. Connected realms just make it appear that the game is more alive than it was.</div></div><hr />

You pretty much answered that yourself. <br />
<br />
As i mentioned, people have grown a lot, the question nowadays wouldnt be IF most players could manage entry raids it's how FAST. If they gate it so that the raids open every time the latest is beaten it would make for a fast paced gloryride :) <br />
<br />
Trust me though, AQ40 and Naxx40 ARE challenging, even the trash was painful in there. I'd easily compare the difficulty of those raids to some of the hardest WoW fights. Nothing in vanilla (that i experienced) comes close to Firefighter, Yogg0, LK 25 HC pre nerf, Muru, Vashj, Kaelthas and Firelands Rag tho. <br />

So much this. Agree with you, and everyone who replied likewise.<br />
<br />
And if Blizzard actually did put up a Vanilla server, it wouldn't just be vanilla diehards who'd check it out, but more recent subscribers. Can you just imagine the demands and confusion?<br />
<br />
&quot;Where's flight? Add Flight!&quot;<br />
&quot;No updated models? Old models look terrible!&quot;<br />
&quot;WTF are all these different ranked spells? So much ability bloat!&quot;<br />
&quot;Where's my Timewarp!&quot;<br />
&quot;Why no Horde paladins or Alliance Shaman?&quot;<br />
&quot;What is this skill needed in order to use different weapon types?&quot;<br />
&quot;Leveling up takes forever!&quot;<br />
&quot;No group finder for dungeons? No raid finder?&quot;<br />
<br />
And on and on. I don't fault them for not putting up a Vanilla server. It's just asking for too many headaches, and he's right- most players (except the small minority wanting it) would poke around for 2-3 weeks and then say &quot;F this, the modern game is better.&quot;<br />

The reality of things is that modern age gamers are extremely spoiled and they'll QQ about anything. No matter what.<br />

I've been playing since Vanilla, loved the game that time, loved the game after, love the game now.<br />
Would i want a Vanilla server? Hell no!! Compared to the commodities we have now i want to kill myself only by thinking of going back and having to skill up weapon types, and having excels to remember the spec trees, having to deal with 40ppl in a raid and the massive lag etc.<br />
I'd really prefer the dev team to spend their time on moving the story forward.<br />
<br />
No flight is perfectly fine for me. For short trips etc you have feather of Aviana, portals, goblin stuff... is more than enough. and FPs are quite effective tbh.<br />
<br />
About the lack of content... I'd personally want to slap anybody saying there's no content... Are you kidding? There is so much stuff to do that you wouldnt know where to start.<br />
It's not just garrison.. it's a MMO, ofc expect some grind. but you certainly cant say there's nothing to do ingame apart from raiding..<br />
Probably some of the &quot;no-content guys&quot; are the same blabbering about wasting resources on a Vanilla server, where there would really be no content at all apart from overbugged raids and primitive pvp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game is a lot more enjoyable when you're playing with good friends, and considering it's not as social as it once was (simply because we were forced to be more social back in the day due to inconveniences and unsophisticated systems), it makes sense that people look back at those times so fondly.</div></div><hr />

Pro flying is the majority. Nobody here is dumb enough to think vanilla server people are the majority except you. Just take a look at the dead vanilla private servers for proof.</div></div><hr />

The infernal is top notch, it's a new spin on the previous &quot;update&quot; to the Infernal look(the angry red ones). The doom guard is okay but there's something about the head region of it that doesn't sit right with me aesthetically. The felguards are &quot;eh&quot;, I actually think the better quality modeling makes their armor look ridiculous. The felhound is a complete departure from what made the felhound design cool(more demon zergling than dog). And the lack of a chestplate on the dread lords is just awful. And their faces being silky smooth with sunken cheeks and no texture at all is just bizarre. It feels like a downgrade from the previous model.</div></div><hr />

Private vanilla and BC servers are not only thriving, they're growing - and that's despite the fact that nearly all of them are unstable, have broken or incorrectly scripted quests and NPC actions, have numerous ugly custom hacks to boost XP gain, provide gear for money, etc. There's obviously a sustained demand for such servers, and Blizz's fear that acknowledging vanilla and BC will undermine their current efforts is what's stopping them. I'd gladly pay $15/month for a correctly scripted BC or vanilla PvE server.<br />
<br />
There are a very few stable, decently scripted private servers which give XP according to vanilla rules, and those are gems. One was launched just a few months ago, and launch day was jammed with people in every starting zone. Even now, that private server has over 5k people playing every weekend. Yes, the retail product has far more overall, but I doubt any individual server has 5k on any day of the week.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor has some good things going for it, and I still play and raid. But subscriptions (according to MMO Champion) are at their lowest point since vanilla. The game has been on a downward trend since Cata, and the usual rationalizations about games having a limited life-cycle may be comforting to the current devs, but not true. Play the vanilla game right now now, private server bugs notwithstanding, and it's still far more addictive than anything in WoD. Quests are hard, gold is hard, mana must be spent wisely, DPS must watch threat, pulls have to be considered even when soloing - get two or three mobs unintentionally and you may die, while in the current game any class can easily solo multiple mobs while questing. Vanilla dungeons require communication and CC, and because there's no cross-server or automated match-making, people on a server must get to know one another, know who's good to group with, and work to get better. It's far more social than today's exile in your own private instance, with no reason to come out - simply a better, more involving game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Flying was removed to get people into the world. Problem: the Garrison (and to a lesser extent, Stormshield and Warspear) removes our need to go out into that world.<br />
<br />
In TBC flying was a way to get to A and B with some new content (the Terrokar fishing areas, Ogri'la). In Wrath it was a fundamental feature (so much they had to put &quot;Loaner&quot; mounts in for people without it for Frost Peaks and Icecrown). Cata and Mists flying was required just to access level top level content. That's all flying became - how you got to level 85/90 areas. Taken as that, flying is soft of useless. They made the level 100 areas in WoD accessible on foot - which made them more dangerous (I remember stumbling into Scorethar's Rise at level 91...) but didn't add much - it was very clear that &quot;I should not be here.&quot;<br />
<br />
That said, I'd like flying back because I enjoyed the freedom it felt I had with it. I understand why they don't, I don't begrudge thier concept - and I'm not quitting over it. But if I had a say, I would suggest that in 6.2 flying in all areas except Tanaan is fine. Say it's fel magic or something. I think this balance worked on the Timeless Isle in Mists, it could work here fine.</div></div><hr />

That's why I'd only support classic realms if they were their own separate subscription. Common, you fogies. Put your money where your mouth is. You want classic servers? Willing to PAY for them? I didn't think so. If they were paid and successful I'll happily eat my words. But I really seriously doubt. The subscription is just there for the upkeep. Blizz doesn't owe you anything.

Particularly, the section &quot;Failing to invest in quality product&quot;. You will see that their new approach is to lower product development costs, and instead heavily increase sales and marketing costs (this at a time when they have more major products than ever to manage).<br />
<br />
It is why WoD is a hollow shell of an expansion. It is why you see more stuff like &quot;Blizzard coming to hellfest!&quot;, &quot;Blizzard is building a real shadowmourne!&quot;, &quot;Content trailers for a store mount and a twitter/selfie patch!&quot;. Aggressive marketing is fine when you actually have content to market. <br />
<br />
It is why the only thing that will increase their WoW subs anymore is playing on people's hype and nostalgia. Same reason Diablo 3 was so popular when the design was horrendous upon release- because D2 was so loved. <br />
<br />
It is why they have completely run dry on creativity, and it can be seen in every nook and cranny of their game. From the lackluster mount designs (not including store mounts, of course) to class design (arms warriors, lol) to PVP (yes we know Ashran is awful but we will keep changing it and forcing it down your throat until you like it) to rehashing what little content there is (6.2 is timeless isle 2.0, hellfire citadel again, mannaroth pulling an onyxia, archimonde again), and this isn't even scratching the surface of all the problems WoW has. The biggest problem of them all might be garrisons. <br />
<br />
Look at the facts. If you still want to defend this misguided company riding the coattails of its former glory days, despite what is laid out in front of you, then I wish you the best, because it truly is an uphill battle.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't get the mount criticism. What, were you THAT jazzed to ride on the back of another cat? I think the most creative/interesting mounts this expansion have been the Gronnling mounts, and they're free in game. With difficult challenges to earn them.</div></div><hr />

Nobody here is dumb enough to think vanilla server people are the majority except you. Just take a look at the dead vanilla private servers for proof.<br />
<br />
The only reason Private vanilla servers are dead is because they stop getting supported. There is a new private server that has been running for a few months now, and has a constant 6000+ playerbase.<br />
<br />
The thing is, even if only a very small percent of the player base wants it, I would think its something Blizzard could easily make money on. I'm just worried that the reason they refuse to release an older content server is that they thing it will take from the newest WoW server player base.<br />
<br />
<br />
how many people playing on private servers give me number 10k 50k 500k 1million 2 .. 3 ?!!! just wondering<br />
Nostalrius Begins has a peak of 7500 concurrent players. With an average of 6000 concurrent. No idea how many people actually play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you seriously believe that its the same people :P? i give up on commenting here now ^^<br />
<br />
And yet why would they deny themselves profit if they will do anything to make more money for less content like everyone says? If a vanilla server was profitable then why not do it? They would NEVER have to make content for it. NEVER have to fix bugs with it and they'd make money? So why not do it if it isn't going to actually make money?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gkai</div><div class="date">2015-05-26, 08:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I understand blizzards concerns about not wanting to make a vanilla server but they should look at the current sustained numbers of private servers and take those into consideration. There's 10k+ players on the most popular vanilla server. Private servers are usually word of mouth spread and to have a 10k player base from your own private server then I think there could be a lot of potential to bring back a lot of players to the game.<br />
<br />
I feel like blizzard should give it a try and make it like a PTR type realm, if it takes off then it shows them that players are interested and if it doesn't take off then well, they gave it a shot. <br />
<br />
There's positives and negatives to adding a vanilla dedicated server. The positives are that it could bring back a lot of subscriptions to the game but it could also reduce the total amount of players playing WoD which looks negative towards the current state of the game. <br />
If the vanilla server was to take off, within a year people are going to be capped out at end game raiding and looking for the next step which would be BC.. the situation kind of presents itself in that Vanilla would only be fun for about 2 years at most until people get bored or start demanding Burning crusade and then we're just replaying the game in order again which makes no sense. <br />
Would vanilla servers take away from next expansion content? With the implement of the server I feel it could start a divide between the community which ultimately leads to negativity.<br />
<br />
Those are just a few positive and negative point I could find off the top of my head, as much as I would love a Vanilla server I'm not sure if it's the smartest approach from a business standpoint. I feel if blizzard was to add it, they would only be kicking themselves in the ass and saying &quot;no one likes the current game, here's vanilla again.&quot; The management team at blizzard are smart people so if they do end up taking a risk and adding it they'll take the smartest approach to it, so here's hoping we can grind back to 60 and re-live those epic moments again (aq 40 gate opening).</div></div><hr />

So they wouldn't have time to create new and exciting store mounts?<br />

Also you would pay the sub for it and you could play vanilla or current exp whenever you want. So everyone wins. Which means it won't be implemented. Blizz doesn't like it if the players win as well</div></div><hr />

&quot;keeping quite isnt ignoring, it is not agree either&quot;<br />
<br />
if they want the WoW community to support them to a fuller value then they need to come out and explain why they agree with something . . like flying, its obvious it is not coming to WoD until the end to of the expac or at all, but it would be nice for someone there to say &quot;well guys we talk about it every day at every meeting, we all agree it is not something we are going to put in WoD, sorry, wait till next expac&quot;<br />
<br />
there , issue over. <br />
<br />
or what about garrisons : &quot; hey guys we listened to your feedback about the garrissons and we agree that you spend to much time there but not in the world itself, we will work on making it better and fuller, in the mean time here is what we can do&quot;<br />
<br />
there, they know, or we know that they know<br />
<br />
Honestly i am stunned at the lack of communication , either way, on any subject, like others had i known this expac was like it is, i would never had paid for it, and although my voice is tiny and small and never will be heard by the game developer, they def lost me, my wife, and 3 friends subs , drop in the bucket for them, but i see it as getting worse for this game.<br />

i would have vented in the WoW boards but i am not upping my sub to do it. its too bad really this game is getting really long in the tooth, and they dont seem to want to fix it</div></div><hr />

I know it's hard to wrap your head around the idea that people like and prefer the older versions on the game, especially with all the new good stuff like getting epics so fast it will make your head spin or sitting in your garrison and waiting for a pvp queue or sitting in your garrison waiting on a dungeon or raid finder or looking for raid queue or going out of your garrison to collect &quot;Treasure&quot;... But some people like the old way better and the reason people don't stay on private servers for long is that they're unstable and some are buggy to unbelievable levels. I've seen sever that were players know that the server is broken with some content being unavailable/ to broken to play, classes don't work how they should/did on live servers. But they keep playing and the server see's more than 1 thousand players a day and you're telling me that these server wouldn't be cost effective/populated, now come on you can't be that far from your player base. People want the old versions of the game because people who want to play that version understand what they like about vanilla, tbc, wrath, and why deny them their fun and force them to seek out other ways of playing the game they want to play. Why would you rather just say &quot;well that's to bad, goodbye&quot;; instead of just catering to this slice of the WoW community and bring them together under the Blizzard banner with support from Blizzard and the have them enjoy how the game how they want be. Maybe it's because I not very business minded but I don't see how this could cost more money than it's makes. And if Blizzard is worried about how much it would cost why not throw up a kick starter or some crowdfunding project?</div></div><hr />

Common sense. The only people that don't like it are world pvp gankers not realizing the feather makes it irrelevant. If these people truly didn't like flying they would have went around mop on the ground. Hypocrites all of them.<br />

Pro-flying people do not want a Vanilla server with flying. They want their normal modern servers with flying.<br />

Pro-Vanilla people want a server ruleset that creates separate Vanilla-themed servers.<br />

But that's my point, that is three iteration of the same game. Not to mention people who want TBC servers or LK servers then it balloons to five iterations of the same game, and none are happy because populations are split. Games grow and evolve new players come and go. If you can't grow with it play a different game that is 10 8 or 6 years old. When people say I want flying back I hear I want to skip content and mobs. When I hear I want play vanilla servers I hear, I want t play the same thing I played 10 years ago over and over and over. Wow has lasted ten years because the have reinvented a fun game on the same theme. The game plays very differently from the game made ten years ago. Enjoy what they offer us or play something different new people we come into replace you. Or you'll grow and enjoy the new game.</div></div><hr />

As i mentioned, people have grown a lot, the question nowadays wouldnt be IF most players could manage entry raids it's how FAST. If they gate it so that the raids open every time the latest is beaten it would make for a fast paced gloryride :) <br />
<br />
Trust me though, AQ40 and Naxx40 ARE challenging, even the trash was painful in there. I'd easily compare the difficulty of those raids to some of the hardest WoW fights. Nothing in vanilla (that i experienced) comes close to Firefighter, Yogg0, LK 25 HC pre nerf, Muru, Vashj, Kaelthas and Firelands Rag tho. <br />
<br />
The point is that it would be either a trip down memory lane or a chance to see which parts are as glorious as oldtimers make them out to be.<br />
<br />
Not sure the open next raid when a boss the last boss was killed would work. I'd predict you'd have the &quot;world firsts&quot; opening things up like mad as they already know how and best way to kill XYZ. Everything would be open in a week? <br />
<br />
But you'd have to get 40 players for all the Vanilla raids... then loose 30 to do Kara...then recruit again for the 20s... hmmm.<br />
<br />
Are we talking though classes kinda stay as they are? Like can my pally spec prot and tank Molten Core or are they reserved to off healing following around being bored in MC?<br />
<br />
<br />
As for flying. WOD zones seem smaller than other zones to me. More cramped not as open. Honestly they seem to be design for running not mounts at all. To me they feel very maze like. Nothing like the Open zones of the other expansion. Of course this is my personal perspective. <br />
<br />
Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if they'd have thought to make certain zones use flying mounts. Spires would have been a good example. Why not have the need to fly there with &quot;birdmen&quot; building platforms and such to fly between. I bet the reason for no flying is that they are using it as a &quot;wall&quot; to keep players out of certain areas and couldn't figure out how to keep you from example Tanaan Jungle without just a invisible wall.</div></div><hr />

I agree that WoW has lost a lot of the social aspect, and that is reflected in the dwindling subs. But, vanilla was a pain in the arse. I remember quitting in the 30's for about 6 months. It was that frustrating to level. Also we were all dumb noobs equipping the wrong stuff and not caring. I suppose that's the thing, the world was 'new', and nothing that Blizzard can do will bring that 'newness' back.<br />
<br />
You're only young once.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
How long is Blizz going to keep playing this self-flattering game of claiming to know the future by saying people will try vanilla, immediately scream about how they prefer the current Garrison Prison With Free Epics so much more, and log out? Private vanilla and BC servers are not only thriving, they're growing - and that's despite the fact that nearly all of them are unstable, have broken or incorrectly scripted quests and NPC actions, have numerous ugly custom hacks to boost XP gain, provide gear for money, etc. There's obviously a sustained demand for such servers, and Blizz's fear that acknowledging vanilla and BC will undermine their current efforts is what's stopping them. I'd gladly pay $15/month for a correctly scripted BC or vanilla PvE server.<br />
<br />
There are a very few stable, decently scripted private servers which give XP according to vanilla rules, and those are gems. One was launched just a few months ago, and launch day was jammed with people in every starting zone. Even now, that private server has over 5k people playing every weekend. Yes, the retail product has far more overall, but I doubt any individual server has 5k on any day of the week.<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor has some good things going for it, and I still play and raid. But subscriptions (according to MMO Champion) are at their lowest point since vanilla. The game has been on a downward trend since Cata, and the usual rationalizations about games having a limited life-cycle may be comforting to the current devs, but not true. Play the vanilla game right now now, private server bugs notwithstanding, and it's still far more addictive than anything in WoD. Quests are hard, gold is hard, mana must be spent wisely, DPS must watch threat, pulls have to be considered even when soloing - get two or three mobs unintentionally and you may die, while in the current game any class can easily solo multiple mobs while questing. Vanilla dungeons require communication and CC, and because there's no cross-server or automated match-making, people on a server must get to know one another, know who's good to group with, and work to get better. It's far more social than today's exile in your own private instance, with no reason to come out - simply a better, more involving game.</div></div><hr />

I often get more annoyed simply by the arrogance and entitlement of some of the players who always expect an answer to everything, to wit-- Blizzard has been a little too open with information and it's simply made people feel like they own a right to the facts, which, until it's publicly released, they do not. Now there are a lot of things Blizzard does I will not support, let alone defend, but player feedback is something they've become so good at it's a travesty to some players when they aren't being fed straight answers. More or less a victim of it's own merit.<br />
<br />
<br />
I mean, is it just me, or are these people (the Blues who respond to feedback) just basically telling players to &quot;fuck off&quot;, in a few better words?While I doubt that's actually their intent, it would not surprise me, I read even some of the juvenile things people here say and it's like... I'd rather not even read it. In fact I've read your post and deduced it was one of thew few decent enough not to ignore. Mostly because I think as a game developer myself I can only dare to dream of having this many people shouting at me. To be honest I'm not sure I'd be ready to take on a playerbase like Blizzards, because woooow.<br />
<br />
Imagine if Ubisoft's PR staff was suddenly replacing Blizzards, you'd be begging Blizzard's PR to come back, it's not their fault they are actually so giving of information it's actually become it's own problem.<br />
<br />
And lest we forget, only a decade ago pre-release game exposition sans some screenshots, blurb and maybe a trailer was all you'd get. You should be thankful Blizzard are this forthcoming with information, rather than demanding more.<br />
<br />
<br />
It seems the blues get angry when players are asking questions and what not..The sheer magnitudes of the same question that they've already answered being broached would definitely annoy me, and keep in mind some of these are simply PR people, not the ones who work on the game and have pride in their work, and can immediately tell you why or why not a decision was made.<br />

That said, I've already explained it's very possible that the Blues would get pissy with the behaviour and interaction some players are giving, especially when most feedback is devoid of reason other than &quot;I DONT LIKE IT&quot;.<br />
<br />
Like, if you're a PR you want to be able to tell the developers why it may be an idea to consider, players whining that it's something &quot;they don't like&quot; is a fairly flacid argument, and what kind of excuse is it, like can you imagine the conversation.<br />
PR: &quot;We've received some reports players don't like X.&quot;<br />
Dev: &quot;I see, what is it that troubles players about X? Perhaps some sort of compromise can be made if legitimate reason is given.&quot;<br />
PR: &quot;I'm afraid the only reasoning is 'Well sir, we don't like it.'&quot;<br />
<br />
Now don't get me wrong, there are certainly some decent reasons why flying omission in Draenor hasn't been liked, especially when you reach max level, but I think the goods outweigh the bads in that situation, if you got flying at Level 100, you'd just save treasure hunting until then when you could cheat, either by monsters being too easy or flying trivializing the otherwise pretty challenging route towards the thing.<br />
<br />
Then it's a 'Can I get flying Early since I've already levelled my one character to 100?'<br />
<br />
And that's a downwards spiral into bad habits, those bad habits being catering to players simply because they whine, see Cataclysm Syndrome.<br />
<br />
There's no pleasing players, and the sort of loud obnoxious players who sought instant gratification Blizzard once pandered to are being overlooked a lot more unless they can provide reasons, that these whiners have to provide reasons now infuriates them because it force them to admit that either:<br />
A.) They're a spoilt brat and want this because it'll make the game better for them but screw anyone who may be dis-serviced by their whining being answered because they pay 15 US dollars a month (et al, just like everyone else) and wouldn't unsubscribe no matter how much they threaten they will to get what they want.<br />
B.) They are a mindless zombie and don't know what they want so are just rolling with Party A because Party A panders to people with absolutely no ambition of their own.<br />
<br />
Good on them I say for sticking to their guns, as a developer making a decision - especially one which some may call a &quot;game changer&quot; - isn't easy. I know this to only a very small degree myself, as I've mentioned I am a non-profit developer myself-- and Blizzard being bold is something that will never fail to impress me, especially when their bolder changes usually end up positively effecting the gameplay experience.<br />
<br />
Losing 3 million subscribers does not necessarily mean the game has dropped in quality, it means it has dropped in quantity, and the majority of those will be back when the patch comes out, and they know they will.<br />
<br />
If there was ever anything redeemable about the current state of the WoW playerbase it's that it has become so predictable.</div></div><hr />

The game has gotten progressively worse since tbc. You would have those seeking nostalgia AND those who never got to experience it. Bored folk such as myself too who have been done w/ WoD for almost 2 months now. <br />
<br />
and the cost... UMMM you guys make like FIFTY MILLION A MONTH. The costs of opening another server or two... seriously.... SMH</div></div><hr />
