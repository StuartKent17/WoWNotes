A Sign of Good Fortune Ahead<br />
Legends say that in his hour of deepest doubt, Emperor Shaohao, last ruler of the Pandaren Empire, was visited by Hogrus, Swine of Good Fortune, as he meditated upon his people’s future. Today, pandaren across Azeroth consider Hogrus to be a sign of prosperity and great things to come. You would be wise to seek his blessing as you pursue your own fortune, wherever the four winds may take you.<br />
<br />
This lucky new mount is bound to propel you into a prosperous year ahead—and it’s now available in the Blizzard Shop and World of Warcraft in-game shop.<br />

Ok so the vulpine mount came out a month and a half ago. This mount is for the Lunar New Year, which is in 6 days. So they should not release this one where it makes sense just cause people are whiny babies? They did a Lunar mount last year too, I think its nice they arent keeping them China exclusive and give everyone the option to buy it. Sometimes buying mounts isnt a big deal cuz honestly farming the same stupid mount over 100 times get old. But this is the wow community and we have to complain about every thing no matter how it affects us.</div></div><hr />

This should be put at the top, as people will post &quot;greed&quot; etc. This was their reward for a 6 month sub. What was our reward again? Oh yeah that stupid boat mount that doesn't actually work on water.<br />
<br />
Be glad we can actually get it. If this was gated behind another 6 month sub I wouldn't be getting it (not like I will be it for $25 either) because bfa is not worth 2x 6 month subs.</div></div><hr />

What he's trying to say is it's one small thing that adds up into much more on a pile that's already bad currently. They have many things that they can do right now to help the game but they choose to do this immediately instead. For starters much of the alliance rep rewards are freaking reskins of the same horse model when they can be making this as a special event mount for the lunar festival instead of a shameless grab for cash or giving another horse reskin number infinity.</div></div><hr />

It could have been a reward from the lunar festival but instead we got 2 recolors of the dragon costume toys.</div></div><hr />

The idea is that I pay 15 dollars to play the game per month, I pay 60 dollars to buy an expansion, the 15 dollars part is a promise to keep the game running and to have new content flowing, the 60 is to have a huge payload of content up front and other additional things added to the purchase. so part of my 15/60 depending on how you view it. got put into peoples pay check to make a really well made mount (doesn't matter what mount) and I don't have any possible way of getting it without giving them more money. I don't care personally about this if the game is in a good state bug wise / gameplay wise / and content wise. but one to two of those aren't up to par at all. (my class was but then they decided to take another shit on enhancement shaman.) so I care that time and money got put into making this when it could be made into fixing bugs / actually looking into problems with gameplay on classes that are having them. (enhancement didn't have any cause the game magically aligned itself and azerite/talents fixed gameplay but then they didn't look into anything saw a couple traits were &quot;overperforming&quot; compared to other traits so they nerfed them into oblivion. and now they are worse then all the traits and are compareable if you switch talents and still underperform to other talents/azerite compared to a different talent and azerite trait combination. it's actually fucking retarded they would sit there and nerf a class that is underperforming without any compensation.)</div></div><hr />

Personally, I love it and I think it's pretty cute. However, since they added new pig models, it would have been nice to get a pig pet from the in-game holiday for Ancestral Coins. Missed opportunity.</div></div><hr />

The item took time and resources to make that could've been spent elsewhere. Also...<br />
<br />
They could've just put it in-game for free. No real reason for a game with a box price and a mandatory subscription to have a shop full of ugly mounts.</div></div><hr />

Why are people mad at this? No one is putting a gun to your head to buy it.<br />
<br />
People are always mad at every shop pet/mount. It's regular predictable wow players.<br />
<br />

Just don't buy it.<br />
Just turn off warmode<br />

It does impact the game when all the resources are put into making new shop content instead of making new ingame content. Espacially when the game is totaly broken and unfinished like it is in BFA. Also this is the second shop mount in a few weeks.<br />
<br />
That said: people would be super mad if china got a cool mount that american or european couldnt get. So it is kinda a lose/lose situation for Blizzard here.<br />

BWT - They should have made some crazy questline in pandaria to obtain this mount. Its an excellent way to make outdated content relevant again and we get to travel to old zones with our max lvl chars.<br />

As a man with university degree, I find it rather interesting that childish people are the ones who call other people &quot;children&quot;, &quot;immature&quot; and things like that.<br />
<br />
There is a reason why I myself don't like microtransactions and things like this.<br />
<br />
Team Fortress 2 is totally fine, it is FREE and most of the shop items doesn't give advantages.<br />
<br />
But when it comes to full-priced games, cosmetic crap just makes me scratch my head. The biggest problem is not Blizzard themselves, but I see a trend spread among the gaming companies. They are selling a game for a full-price with no microtransactions, just to lower the price after a few weeks and put micro-transactions on it.<br />
<br />
I had a game where I actually paid full-price for, just to know that it would go free with micro-transactions. It frustrated me so much, that I sold my gaming computer just to buy Switch.<br />
<br />
I personally don't care about WoW, i've already quit the game but like Bethesda, EA and so on, I just love watching the trainwreck. They think that these players who are spending tons of money on in-game shop items is going to save the game. Until every person with &quot;toxic masculinity&quot; abandon the ship and the game just dies off after trying to squeeze every single penny out of these people.<br />
<br />
I hope Nintendo doesn't go the same way.</div></div><hr />

You are delusional if you think the resources generated by the store mount actually goes into developing the game. Blizzard is cutting costs.

Where is the WoW team getting reduced? Do you have a source for this claim?<br />

Its like complaining about the way shitty mobile games are made, where they are made up from, you giving them loads and loads of money, to progress faster in the game, but they only keep making them that way, because people keep throwing LOADS AND LOADS of money at them, dont fucking blame blizzard from wanting to earn more money, when people happely throw it at them, if YOU dont like it, just dont fucking buy it jessus christ kids.<br />
<br />
ps. prolly gonna buy this mount my self, because i like how it looks, and dont really care about the 25€, in the end we all spend money on stupid shit :) just enjoy it and move along.<br />
<br />
They only make them because people are not buying the subscription anymore. It's getting more and more evident that wow is turning into a pay to play game. It probably sells, but not as good as a subscription game does.</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but which part of the store screams pay to win? <br />
<br />
Everyone on this dammed site keeps throwing that term around and I literally think you all have 0 fucking idea what it actually means. There isn't one single item or service on that store that counts as a pay to win feature. Pay to skip content, pay to sit on a pretty (Or in this case on ugly arse) mount, pay for convenience but not a pay to win</div></div><hr />

Paying for your subscription with gold (if that’s what you’re talking about) generates more money for Blizz than just subscribing because the tokens you buy with gold were bought with real money - more real money than straight up subscribing costs. Blizz is still making a huge profit off WoW, selling unique shop mounts is just more money for the sake of more money. It isn’t a necessity to keep the game going by any means.<br />

BWT - They should have made some crazy questline in pandaria to obtain this mount. Its an excellent way to make outdated content relevant again and we get to travel to old zones with our max lvl chars.<br />
<br />
I wish Blizzard would add much more mounts to obtain outside of a raid drop and vendors from new factions.<br />

But then people bitch endlessly about reusing old content and how lazy it is.</div></div><hr />

Right, and people keep playing a game that they don't like? Ask this question honestly to yourself, the most players are working and are busy. You really think that the mainbase of players spend their precious time on a game what they don't like? Maybe if you are 16 and have a lot of time to waste, it is not like in Vanilla where people in general were a lot younger than they are now.</div></div><hr />

well ok, maybe you can call it &quot;lazy&quot; if they put questlines, stories and mounts in old content. But atleast then Blizzard gets to utilize the world they have created so far. Instead of having to create a whole new xpac, a new zone and much more were they put in mounts.<br />

Its alot lezz lazy than just smack it up on the store. <br />

They absolutely are. You’ve made the claim that everyone who complains is unsubbed. Have you looked at the official forums? Almost entirely complaining. You have to be subscribed to post there. Saying everyone is enjoying the game and only unsubscribed people are upset is demonstrably false. The argument “well people are older now so only 16yos who have lots of free time are upset by the game and still subscribed” is frankly absurd. <br />

The reason why I said that the ones who are complaining are unsubbed is that it goes beyond my imagination that people are still subscribed and complaining at the same time. It was a sarcastic post because I know perfectly well that people who complain here are still subscribed to the game what they clearly don't like.<br />
<br />
Besides that a lot of players are not present on forums like this or their official forums.<br />

Before you go slamming people into the ground for being a stupid ass, perhaps you need to read properly what they said. When did he actually mention anything about pay to win?

Of course they are bought with real money. All mounts are also sold directly to customers via credit cards. But do you have any evidence for your claim that blizzard is making a huge profit on wow? They stopped revealing subscriber numbers when it went downhill badly. I suppose investors in Activision Blizzard are more concerned about the overall picture than for a single old game like wow, but my guess would be that wow is not making more money now than it used to 5-8 years ago. Collectors are only a small margin of people, I doubt they make up for the subscriber loss even if they spend a lot money on vanity items. WoW is not built like &lt;insert pay to play smart phone game here&gt; so it can't work on solely sell mounts and stuff. And why did they announce they were removing mounts from the store if it was not a bait? If it was selling anyway they wouldn't need to do stuff like that. That's a last resort business move for sinking ships.</div></div><hr />

<br /> 
One, I didn't call anyone stupid. Clueless indicated? Maybe. <br />
<br />
If you were buying a large amount of gold from the store; as in 1 token being worth loads. You might have something to back to you up. But last I saw it was 178k. you can score an easy 70k just from leveling a single new toon from 0-120, let alone any end game grinding / crating / drop. Like I said it's pay for convenience. You're only speeding up a natural process. Ignoring all of that, buying gold has always been a thing, so by your logic people could P2W in vanilla. <br />
<br />
I didn't once even acknowledge his argument about store items for £ or balancing the unsubs, let alone disagree with it. So no idea why you're throwing that there. <br />
<br />
Anyways like you said personal opinion. You're entitled to one, it might be wrong, but you're still entitled to it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well that's a no from me, but thanks activision blizzard. I just bought resident evil 2 (a FULL triple A game) for about 40 bucks. I am thinking of buying subnautica below zero for about 10 dollars (a incredibly good indie game that offers multiple hours of enjoyment that is CHEAPER than a single mount that offers nothing).<br />
<br />
honestly, the situation with the people that waste good money on these mounts is just natural selection at this point, they will be preyed upon by greedy corporations, if it wasn't activision blizzard, it would be somebody else. You may think &quot;ahhh it's just 25 bucks&quot; or whatever, but it is just stupid either way. Supreme has that same &quot;dumb people item&quot; vibe to it, only for kids that are richer.<br />
<br />
now, for the people who say &quot;it doesnt impact the game&quot;: yea it does, blizzard could have made a interesting questline to unlock this mount INGAME, as a bonus event or something like that. You are already playing 15 bucks EVERY month, plus the expansion price. have some pride and stop bending over for blizzard for christ sakes. But alas, i guess it's useless to try and argue with brick, thick walls.<br />
<br />
Well I get the point your trying to make it’s a bit flawed. You bought resident evil 2 a remake of a game that is already available for cheaper but is a bit uglier. So you pretty much bought a cosmetic version of resident evil 2 while at the same time telling people they shouldn’t buy cosmetics. So you would fall into your own pit of natural selection.</div></div><hr />

<br />
yeah... this is the third year blizz has done this for china, its a chinese thing they do for them, so to give the rest of the world the thing for free would be kinda bullshit.<br />
<br />
so its either we can buy it, or we literally cannot get it at all.<br />

<br />
This is how the boar mounts should've been running! <br />
<br />
Looks a lot more like the old boars. :&gt;<br />
<br />
pigs and boars are very different creatures though... so them running the same is not super accurate. glad they dont.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
quick fact for you lot, boars and pigs are VERY interesting creatures, minor alterations can VERY quickly change entire things about them.<br />
Vietnamese pot bellies if released out into the wild in matter of months to grow large tusks, become very aggressive, and grow thick coats of fur.<br />
<br />
<br />
and on the other end wild boars if castrated will lose their shield and actually become almost feminine over the next while (cant remember how long, i think a few months?), making them better hunting targets and their meat better tasting, their shields shrink making them much more chubby and also alot less agressive and chargy, also easier targets.</div></div><hr />
