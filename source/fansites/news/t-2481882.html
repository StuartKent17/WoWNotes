Concidering their internal testing team have the skill of a top 200-300 guild, there is no way in hell they even reached the boss at 50%. Like kj which they admitted that they were skipping parts of fight and jumping to next phase without never ever testing the fight fully. PLus the retarded testing they did on ptr was with 390 ivl gear.<br />
<br />
If THIS IS NOT OVER LVL 9000 stupidity by a small indy company, then i dont know what is. Evry boss that wasnt tested on ptr was/is a distaster. Raden, kj, and now this. But i have faith. one day close to year 2045 they will learn.</div></div><hr />

Mythic is SUPPOSED to be incredibly hard, and they go off and nerf it. It's only been alive for one week and already the nerf bat is in full swing. I'll admit I don't do mythic myself but these nerfs make the world first race far less interesting.</div></div><hr />

<br />
While i agree with this to some part: this is a 2 boss dungeon. And making mythic too hard is also not really the way to go. If they really want something like this, we need mythic+ raids. (something many wanted since release of mythic+ dungeons)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact that you don't do mythic pretty much eliminates your voice. There's a difference between &quot;challenging&quot; and &quot;unfairly overtuned&quot;. If the players have already mastered the mechanics and optimized/min-maxed their damage/healing/tanking output, and the fight is still un-killable, then as the designer you're just wasting their time until you enable them to achieve their goal which they deserve to reach.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The thing is, developers are rarely as good as dedicated players in ANY game. So you can't really test it out for top end guilds anyway. I personally prefer that they are overtuned and then get nerfed, since that would affect all guilds equally. It makes the race more exciting than an undertuned boss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not rude, it's just ignorant. You can test for months, and still not find ALL of the bugs or issues with a fight. They're still adjusting Jaina, they've gone back and adjusted bosses from past expansions. Things come up, bosses are sometimes over-tuned, or under-tuned. It happens. As long as they're fixing known issues in a timely manner, we should commend them for that. If they turn a blind eye to RNG that screws over folks, then that's a different story.</div></div><hr />

This is a bit of a special case here, because gear isn't really a factor. On something like Jaina, they were effectively undergeared because they hadn't been farming mythic for XX weeks - but since the gear from CoS is barely upgrades if even, that's practically irrelevant here. If the top guilds in the world in the best gear realistically available have trouble killing it, chances are it's simply overtuned in some way.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not to mention these guilds can class stack very geared classes as well from farming BoD for 3 months.<br />
<br />
Method is at what, 500+ pulls?<br />
<br />
Even if they killed him, due to guilds being at the gear cap already, we would be lucky to see more than 10 guilds to land a kill before 8.2.</div></div><hr />

There will always be incremental upgrades from BoD and first boss CoS. It makes a difference.. Plus they have to optimize their classes of choice. If gear didn't matter then they would have not done BoD at all during this reset</div></div><hr />

<br />
What gear? Everyone in Method has their BiS or close to it, and the gear from Cabal really isn't good enough to help them (to say nothing of the fact that most pieces have negative side-effects which is terrible for progression). Bar some very lucky TFs for 1 or 2 more overall ilvls, there isn't that much more they can do on that front. <br />
<br />
The boss is obviously stupidly hard if a top guild in almost full BiS that is class stacking the living shit out of life still takes 600+ pulls before they even get to 10%.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That doesn't make it hard... that just makes the numbers some dude typed in perhaps unrealistically high.<br />
<br />
But raids should always be like this... you should HAVE to gear from the earlier bosses in the same raid before you can kill the main boss. But not anymore... tey have to nerf it so Method can do it in the first week or two. It should take MONTHS to kill a final boss.</div></div><hr />

Just because current top guilds can not kill it does not mean boss is over-tuned, there is a chance they are just not doing it correctly or failing to perform at level they need to perform to beat it. Same story was with yogg+0, everybody was on the wagon it is not possible to do it, top guilds can not kill it, this proves it that fight is impossible, until someone did it...<br />
<br />
Overall, if they wish to nerf some fight, it is Blizzard choice, but stop talking like you have some experience with the boss fight or know for a fact that fight was over-tuned, it is sad to read all of these comments.</div></div><hr />

If this would take months for top guilds like Method then it would be simple unkillable for everyone else. Or you want new raids every few years so people have a chance to kill it also?</div></div><hr />

Kind of sounds like Sunwell doesn't it? Newsflash... a raid does not have to be clearable by all. It just has to be clearable... and that makes for a really amazing goal for everyone... mere mortal players will strive and fail.. until they don't.<br />
<br />
And others will strive and fail, and fail, and fail... until they have stories of the boss they simply could not conquer.<br />

<br />
There is currently 37 guilds on Uu'nat without a kill &amp; we're talking about the best players in the world here throwing everything they have at it. When you are 600 pulls &amp; 100 hours into a single boss from one guild alone you know something is amiss.<br />
<br />
These are hotfixes which mean clearly it wasn't intentional to be tuned that way. Can you honestly see yourself subsidalos spending 100 hours on this boss? I wouldn't, I'd be burnt out and move onto another game so keep in mind this is not an encounter that once you kill it it'll just become easier as it is extremely unforgiving.<br />
<br />
<br />
But raids should always be like this... you should HAVE to gear from the earlier bosses in the same raid before you can kill the main boss. But not anymore... tey have to nerf it so Method can do it in the first week or two. It should take MONTHS to kill a final boss.<br />
<br />
This is part of the same tier as Battle for Dazar'alor so the 3 months guilds have farmed Mythic is more than enough gear to clear this raid. The gear in this raid is gimmicky, you have some cool effects but at an expense. These items from this raid are meant to compliment gear sets not be a progression path.<br />
<br />
This is not Vanilla/Classic anymore where bosses difficulty was simply ignored for a long time, Blizzard has clearly been seeing all these guilds wiping on Uu'nat and adjusted it accordingly.<br />
<br />
<br />
Kind of sounds like Sunwell doesn't it? Newsflash... a raid does not have to be clearable by all. It just has to be clearable...<br />

?<br />
<br />
<br />
So you rather would like to see guild disbands than clear the raid (Muru was called guild destroyer for some reason)? How you can call raid clearable if top guild would need few months to kill it? If they can do now like 800 pulls in 1 week (Unat example) so you expect to have how many pulls for last boss? Lets say 6 months, 20 days in month with raids, thats around 14000 pulls for a boss? <br />
<br />
You are just trolling with this statements or just dont know what you are even talking about and just spew some nonsense like &quot;hurr durr, 1 guild can kill it in 1 week, so easy, almost like LFR&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The issue is, how do you know what is possible and what isn't possible if you're not communicating with the top guilds in the world? and you can't even test your own raids due to lack of skilled players internally? I guess it's just relying on cold hard math, a lot of math, for a lot of abilities. Even azerite pieces contain hundreds of variables each, and there's 3 of those for each player, you'd need to factor those into every single fight you develop including bug-testing etc. <br />
<br />
In short: I guess they already have their own internal spreadsheets and attempt to develop a boss that would only be killable by the 0.5 percentile of players. This doesn't account for a lot of things and there's huge margin for error when designing a boss encounter for 20 players, each having hundreds of variables needing included in the overall formula It is absolutely unrealistic that the boss would be 100% tuned and 100% bugfree without extensive testing on the PTR and internally. <br />
<br />
I'm sure Blizzard does have this down to a science and they can easily calculate how killable a boss is just like you can see how likely you are to complete a garrison table quest - but even if they can calculate that, they can't account for other things that do get left out. <br />
<br />
In my opinion: nerfing the boss twice before it has been killed shows that the boss did have overlapping issues between mechanics and those mechanics weren't internally tested, or even discovered until live. Those overlapping mechanics throughout did make the fight not only RNG-based but insanely hard to reliably counter. <br />
<br />
- Blizzard needs to communicate more with top guilds. <br />
- the fight needs to be tested more on the PTR (I believe guilds didn't get much time to try out the raid this time around, 3-4 hours with disconnects for both bosses)</div></div><hr />

Newsflash... a raid does not have to be clearable by all. It just has to be clearable... and that makes for a really amazing goal for everyone... mere mortal players will strive and fail.. until they don't.<br />
<br />
And others will strive and fail, and fail, and fail... until they have stories of the boss they simply could not conquer.<br />
<br />
If everyone can kill it.. then it's really not all that big of a deal huh?You do realize that Mu'ru was nerfed rather quickly, right? And then again with 10% hp nerf some time later. Sunwell was not some magical land where nothing was never changed. It also had actual gear progression, so top guilds didn't wipe 500+ times with nearly maxed gear.<br />
<br />
Hell, Mass Resurrection didn't exist. Wipe recovery took far longer. Mu'ru required single target buffing Amplify Magic. Warlocks needed to farm soul shard during the raid. Nowadays, the top can do much more pulls in far less time. I've been there, I've killed KJ and yet I'm staying away from CoS in its' current form.</div></div><hr />

Mythic is SUPPOSED to be incredibly hard, and they go off and nerf it. It's only been alive for one week and already the nerf bat is in full swing. I'll admit I don't do mythic myself but these nerfs make the world first race far less interesting.<br />
<br />
You don't even seem to understand some basic shit ... There's a difference between nerfing and fixing shit.This fight like the KJ one was basically unkillable. As someone said in a previous post blizzard's testing team is a bunch on plebs , not skilled enought to be able to test phases on hard bosses so the tuning is fucked up badly.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
Ofc not. Concidering their internal testing team have the skill of a top 200-300 guild, there is no way in hell they even reached the boss at 50%. Like kj which they admitted that they were skipping parts of fight and jumping to next phase without never ever testing the fight fully. PLus the retarded testing they did on ptr was with 390 ivl gear.<br />
<br />
If THIS IS NOT OVER LVL 9000 stupidity by a small indy company, then i dont know what is. Evry boss that wasnt tested on ptr was/is a distaster. Raden, kj, and now this. But i have faith. one day close to year 2045 they will learn.<br />
<br />
This is so damn true! their testing team is a just a bunch of plebs that is well known.I dont even wanna imagine the rest of blizzard employees playing the game. In fact i think a long time ago i saw lore streaming and i had to close the stream after 2 mins cuz i was about to puke watching him play shaman.But i bet he has opinions and sugestions and shit about classes and balance and he can't fucking hit WASD right.<br />

There isn't? Why not? Isn't our population higher than ever before? Isn't there a fresh batch of kids turning 14 years old this year?<br />
<br />
If the game was shit... if the endgame was inaccessible... WHY did it grow to TBC? Why didn't the word get out that endgame was too hard an shun people from playing? Why did it get even worse with end of TBC and STILL it grew?<br />

<br />
And what, pray tell, is the other way to make things hard in a video game?<br />
<br />
It doesn't HAVE to be hard. It has to take investment. In Classic that investment was the time to attune, to gear, to craft resist gear, to farm soul shards, to gather reagents, to gear from dungeons. It tooks weeks from max level before you Could raid... now it takes hours from dinging max level.<br />
<br />
So in order to make it &quot;cost&quot; something...they made it numerically harder to take more attempts... then they numerically make it easier as time goes by to allow other people to kill it. That isn't &quot;hard&quot;, that is simply artificially gating.<br />

And yet, it was cleared by almost NOONE. See my statement above regarding investment... being able to pull more times is bad game design... again.. might as well just queue up your attemps... the RPG aspect for this so called MMO just doesn't exist anymore.<br />

So you rather would like to see guild disbands than clear the raid (Muru was called guild destroyer for some reason)? How you can call raid clearable if top guild would need few months to kill it? If they can do now like 800 pulls in 1 week (Unat example) so you expect to have how many pulls for last boss? Lets say 6 months, 20 days in month with raids, thats around 14000 pulls for a boss? <br />
<br />
You are just trolling with this statements or just dont know what you are even talking about and just spew some nonsense like &quot;hurr durr, 1 guild can kill it in 1 week, so easy, almost like LFR&quot;.<br />

Oh WAhhhhhahhhh... we can't kill this boss it's our raid's fault, it's the guild's fault.. i quit this lame guild.&quot;&quot;<br />

My counterpoint<br />
1. It is Mythic so it is fully understood that a lot of guilds will not see this content<br />
2. In TBC there was no Mythic tier difficulty or heroic difficulty for raids so ALL guilds were forced into that fight..i.e. guild killer<br />
3. If you killed Muru and cleared Sunwell then I guarantee that is held up as one of your greatest WoW achievements</div></div><hr />

<br />
Absolutely agree.<br />
<br />
It has been stated that only a very small percent of wow player base pushed Sunwell. Clearly that super high end of numerical difficulty is not enjoyed by the masses. Still they devise the Mythic encounters then cut it back for heroic, normal, and LFR.<br />
<br />
Why do this at all? Why have a &quot;super hard version when only a very small percentage will enjoy it?<br />
<br />
Why not just have 1 raid difficulty that takes time to prepare for, but is more achievable by you talented but not &quot;elite&quot; playerbase? It doesn't have to be uber hard.. it has to be rewarding and cost something. The problem with Mythic is is costs nothing but gold which everyone has an abundance of.<br />
<br />
And take that extra dev time and make more content? More encounters? more often?<br />
<br />
The people that cleared Sunwell in TBC have some serious bragging rights... was it overtuned? Yes... and i should have never shipped at that level... but therein is Blizzard's problem.. they release stuff all the time without actually testing it. i.e. &quot;The artifact power system didn;t turn out like we expected.&quot; &quot;The legendary bad luck prevention system was acting opposite of ho we intended&quot;, etc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Have you read the changes &amp; did you see the attempts in Phase 3 in it's shipped state? Other people will argue with me but that was not doable, the overlap of abilities were brutal to the point deaths would occur irrespective of how good your healers are. Most of it was timing changes not straight up nerfs to boss abilities damage / health, the storm one is highly irrelevant &amp; with the timing alterations its made it in a highly killable state.<br />
<br />
The argument about time investment, are you fully aware at what lengths guilds went to compete at the highest level? They literally logged in every day doing AP farming for hours and hours for Battle for Dazar'alor, some people doing as many as 1000 islands in a single week, there is your time investment and that is not even scratching the surface at the length of preparation they did.</div></div><hr />

How is that any different to farming reagents for potions/flasks/resist potions &amp; gear which is part of your argument in time investment in order to raid. They farmed AP because of the gear in Battle for Dazar'alor which required that level to unlock its perks, ask any raider if they enjoy that game design..<br />
<br />
I remember playing classic being in Felwood for 6 hours a day farming elementals to craft Nature resist potions simply for one nights raiding in Ahn'Qiraj. Nothing has changed like you clearly are adamant about since then except attunement which lets face it was simply a way in order for the content not to be consumed within a week which they've done now with staggered difficulty releases.<br />
<br />
Hardly anything in this game is exciting anymore, I've played every expac on and off and it's not the same game you are clearly so fond of, that's coming in the summer with World of Warcraft Classic where being a no lifer means you're ahead of everyone else.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure they hated the design... <br />
<br />
Farming reagents takes you into the open world interacting with other people, isn't island expeditions instanced? Isn;t having to level your alchemy, herbing, blacksmithing, mining, first aid, etc more interesting than running a thousand islands?<br />
<br />
Farming Felwood... in the open world. Famring reputation in the open world. Farming herbs in the open world. Farming a mob for a recipe int he open world. Farming cloth to level first aid in the open world. Farming gold for you epic mount in the open world. Farming dungeons for gear and enchanting mats in stances. Doing attunements with guildies in the open world.<br />
<br />

<br />
Farming AP in Island Expeditions in an instance. 1000 times. Come on.. .you really telling me there is no difference?<br />

Totally agree... Encounters do not have to be overly difficult. They need to take some time to learn, then be farmable for drops for the entire raid. Hard enough that if people start to zone out, you wipe, easy enough that once you have farther bosses on farm they get easier to kill and therefore killing them faster (or better yet with hardmodes so you get different loot)</div></div><hr />

I'm not sure if that's bad for any party involved, since 1. the guilds get a challenge and 2. Blizzard gets more eyes on their game. So I think it's not the end of the world if mythic has balance fixes as a &quot;soft challenge mode&quot;; it's not elegant but how else do you challenge these guilds?<br />
<br />
It does bring up the topic, should this type of balance be a thing in the first place, should we just abandon the world firsts and stop trying to cater to such a niche, risking balance woes thanks to it? I'd say that if balancing affects the general class balance, then yes it should be abandoned. There are many factors which has led us to where we are with classes, and overly strict balancing is a large and unsung part of it. But just encounter balancing, I think that is fine.<br />
<br />
There's also the consideration, has the game become too &quot;game-lobby&quot; and artificial with things like this, and there I would say that it's definitely a concern. The very fact we have four difficulty modes is a good sign. :P</div></div><hr />

Maybe before you can even kill it you have to attune? Farm resist gear? Gear up from dungeons and crafting first? And not just you but the entire raid team?<br />

Then it be hard enough to take a few weeks to learn it well but then be farmable?<br />

<br />
Yeah.. like that.<br />
<br />
But we're specifically talking about Uu'nat here &amp; if you understand the mechanics it will never truly be farmable. It is an encounter where one individuals mistake is pretty much a wipe.<br />
<br />
For guilds who just run normal raiding hours this will take weeks to down even in it's current state. The top end guilds now are probably on about 110 hours on this boss, you work that out into a normal 4-5 hour a day raiding guild. Say 5 hours per day, that's 22 days, over three weeks of continuous play every day for 5 hours.<br />
<br />
Gear up from dungeons &amp; craft? These guilds literally do multiple clears to trade loot which is essentially the same thing &amp; have about 3-4 max level characters to maintain in order to help the gearing process. If anything the loot trading makes it more optimal to funnel gear to the characters that need it.<br />
<br />
Your argument really isn't well thought out as this boss is still very difficult &amp; you clearly don't know the sheer level of time these guilds put in to this badly designed game. Doing that AP grind in islands was simply because it was the most efficient route to gain the levels on the neck needed to make the gear you got from the raid actually you know... viable and wearable.<br />
<br />
You're referring back to resist gear which imo was a very long time ago which ended roughly after the second expansion where the whole raid needed some resist gear, again a poor game/encounter design merely to prolong content consumption and nothing more. Now you can work your way through each difficulty if that is your thing not like the old days where there was simply one difficulty.<br />
<br />
This raid Crucible of Storms was simply timegated which = your attunement. Raids were released with the patches and you had to attune, now the patches hit with the raids but have an opening date. The only difference being you simply need to wait rather than do a bunch of quests.</div></div><hr />

A raid should not be so unforgiving that &quot;one individuals mistake is pretty much a wipe&quot;... you have left the realm of an MMORPG,,, and entered into some world of competitive gameplay.<br />

It is numerically difficult. They will reduce the numbers, and continue to reduce numbers, until a significant portion of players clear it.<br />

They may also find that is is functionally too difficult for the game system to overcome... in which case they adjust the ability timings and durations.. oh look.. more numbers.<br />

Guilds struggling in phase 3 which starts at 45% aren't wiping because of any numbers problem right now.<br />
<br />
The debuff which comes in every 45 seconds (was 30 seconds) is completely RNG on which member of your raid it goes on (except tanks) so by the time the boss dies now (pre-hotfix much higher #) you should have around 6-7 of these on players which make them receive no healing and therefore have to be in close proximity to others to leech health. <br />
<br />
As well as the two beams cutting across the room giving players a damage debuff. <br />
<br />
The gift of n'zoth ability called lunacy which means your whole raid is vulnerable to everyone's attacks for 4 seconds so all the raid needs to be careful. <br />
<br />
Then you have the adds which if they kill your tank is pretty much game over.<br />
<br />
Then the void zones on the floor which if hit will heal the boss for 4%.<br />
<br />
Then Unstable Resonance which requires all the raid to move around without stepping on opposite marks or else it'll cause an explosion and likely one shot 4-5 people.<br />
<br />
All this combined for almost half the bosses hp (45-0) is punishing guilds and is nothing to do with a numbers thing, in action all of this the encounter becomes more about co-ordination &amp; praying the healing debuffs fall right.</div></div><hr />

Should just stop responding to him/her. We argued back and forth and now have each other on ignore. Point is, he/she is a Classic fanboi/gurl and just comes into forums to shit on retail while trying to promote Classic. Hence his/her post involving resist gear and attunements earlier.</div></div><hr />
