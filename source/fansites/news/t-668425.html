Yeah...this pet is so cool, it's probably TCG or Real Life Event shit, not obtainable without spending loads of money :(<br />

<br />
Regardless, I'm glad they changed HotR back. Physical would mean it would be mitigated by armor and therefore provide less threat unless they put a large threat bonus on it. As for the Ardent Defender changes... I suppose 30% off was a bit much but I'd like to know the reason behind it. (Basically if this nerf was due to PvE or PvP)</div></div><hr />

That's bad, we never have a mage in our raid since the only one we had stopped PVE (Garon EU, recruting if someone read this :p).<br />
<br />
Why removing this scroll ? (yes I know, because this buff is the only utility of a mage)</div></div><hr />

I'll get the Grunty Murloc Marine in a few weeks but that monk blows that Murloc out of the water!<br />
Coolest pet ever! Damn, I really hope it'll be somewhat attainable, and not just for some asian market special something again, like that golden pig etc.<br />
<br />
If that's the 100 pet achievement reward I hope they'll add a few more pets. I'm at 78 or something and still haven't got 9 of the tournament pets, but even with those and the raptors getting to 100 would be really freakin hard. I got pretty much all the other pets, only missing the Hyacinth Macaw, the green dragon whelp and the rare drops like the phoenix in Magister's Terrace.</div></div><hr />

for a pet to get the majority of their customer base back on new Chinese servers ?<br />

in case you hadn't noticed the WoW user base has more than halfed because of problems in the far east.<br />

All the scrolls/drums are buffs that increase health in some form (except this one). Also, you can get a weaker int buff from a felhunter.</div></div><hr />

Unless you were being sarcastic, I don't think it was a nerf. The cd was reduced as well, so now you're basically getting 6 bones every 2 minutes instead of 4. Sure it might cost an extra rune, but that's the price I guess.</div></div><hr />

I don't know how ANYONE hasn't realized this yet. but the Pandaren monk probably will be the next hero class. remember a while back this guy on wowwiki that had leaked the hero classes? he named the death knight and the Pandaren monk. and i seriously doubt they would go through all this trouble with introducing them now and a pet named the &quot;pandaren monk&quot;, and not as a hint to the future.

<br />
<br />
You must be confused, if they were to introduce the Pandaren and a hero class it would most likely be a Brewmaster as the hero class.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is currently working on Cataclysm and they are probably doing some work on the following expansion, but I doubt they are far enough to decide on another hero class much less toss hints into the game. It would be FAR to early for a leaked hero class from two expansions away. Basically, this Pandaren Monk mini pet isnt some hint at the future but most likely just early implementation of the next Collectors Edition pet.</div></div><hr />

i wouldn't say im confused. i mean the pet IS called the pandaren Monk not pandaren Brewmaster. second they already know exactly how wow will end. they dont have to start work on a game to know how it will turn out. Third its not a leak. Its just something i picked up on thats all. And hell its blizzards game. they could hint at something 12 expansions early if they wanted to. i mean emerald dream was hinted at since wow was released, and we still haven't heard anything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All your suggestion of better choices have just as much vanity in them. why make the old races run better? Running animations do nothing, and you don't look at them that much once you get your mount. One of the reasons for MMORPGs is the stuff you get to customize your character.<br />

As do a whole LOT of other people.<br />

Blizz added a Pet Supplies vendor, too: Breanni (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=28951), named and modeled after Breanni (http://www.warcraftpets.com/about/) of WarcraftPets.com (http://www.warcraftpets.com/news/) fame.<br />
<br />
Breanni's site boasts an active membership of over 50,000 people, and I seriously doubt that's all of the pet collectors world wide.<br />
<br />
If I had to guess, that's probably a small fraction of them. I know out of my circle of friends in game, there's 11 avid pet collectors, and I'm the only one with a collection on Breanni's site.<br />
<br />
Extrapolate from there, that means there's probably a good half a million people that care.<br />
<br />
Judging by the replies in this thread, I'm guessing I'm more right than not, too. ;)<br />

<br />
1. Not all Collector's Edition have had whelps. CE of the base game came with a Panda, Mini-Diablo and Zergling. So it's very much possible that Cataclysm won't come with a whelp.<br />
<br />
2. So far all Bind to Account mini pets have been from Collector's Editions except Tyrael (World Wide Invitational 2008) and the Baby Blizzard Bear (being online on WoW's 4th birthday).<br />
<br />
<br />
So, this pandaren monk is most likely related to either the Cataclysm CE or WoW's 5th birthday (since WWI and BlizzCon seems to be the same thing these days). But it could possibly be something completely different. But as we just got to know about the next round of TCG loot cards it's probably not related to that. But it could be related to the magazine or some other competition though.</div></div><hr />

Either your joking and i just got whooshed, or you are a complete dunce. I'm going to guess you can't wrap your head around how to deal with a DK and are just pissed about it. We've all been playing a game called world of rogue and pallycraft for a while now. A rogue being able to stun-lock someone down completely is OP. A pally requiring 5 PEOPLE to down them, only to bubble to full health at the last second is OP. Those two stay on top in PVP while blizzard repeatedly takes a hot, steamy, soft-serve ice cream style shit on the other classes. And if your happy about the dk change from a pve standpoint... i hope your guild boots you to the curb. anything that keeps my raid members alive longer in a tough fight is a big plus in my book.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, had to. There are just THAT many pets around these days. I can't wait to find out how this latest one is obtained. Probably Brewfest or 5th aniversary (sp?).

I admire your gentle tone after my berserk btw, you're a good person. It wasn't meant to offend anyone, I just have this vendetta with Blizzard lately.<br />
<br />
Just try to think in my track for a moment. I'm the gameplay guy, I play WoW to stimulate my brain in an entertaining alternative to watching movie, being with friends, playing some sport or simply keeping myself active. I pay as a normal customer each month, so I demand to have the gameplay updated frequently to not get bored too easily, how can that in anyway for anyone be solved by adding more pets to the game? You have 103 pets, what will you do with the new one that you didn't do with the last one, how will that little shit that just stands there, stimulate you to play for another month? <br />
<br />
So Blizzard keeps putting alot of time in adding new pets, creating new animations for them and cute detailed stuff. But they simply can't update an insanely ugly running animation that has been the same for 4 fucking years and so many people getting frustrated by the NE male. It's not only that, fix PvP balance, fix something todo than just idling in dalaran all the time, fix so people actually go out in the real world and meet each other, fix the game first before adding the final touches like pets, there are so many gamebreaking fixes todo rather than adding pets, they have far much important stuff to put their time on. <br />
<br />
I'm pissed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Wow, you make horrific arguments. Explain how fixing the NE run animation is different from adding a pet when viewed against your 'updated frequently to not get bored too easily' requirements? The fact that you think this is a valid argument is staggering. I don't see anyone getting frustrated by the NE males, plenty still play them. Fact is, new and shiny gets and keeps people, simple as that.<br />
<br />
You also appear to be one of those people who thinks there is only one small team of people making this game. Do you SERIOUSLY think that the person who created the art and animation for this pet is responsible for PVP balance? Exactly how does that workday go?<br />
<br />
8AM: I drew a few new character concepts<br />
9AM: Worked on modeling new pets<br />
10AM: Worked on pet animation<br />
12PM: Lunch<br />
1PM: Started writing code to fix Arena imbalance<br />
3PM: Worked on debugging TOC raid bosses, can't quite lick this one bug<br />
5PM: Time for home!<br />
<br />
And I thought I had a lot to do at work!<br />
<br />
Oh, and just because: WTF! does 'fix so people actually go out in the real world and meet each other' even mean? Is there something broken in game that stops me from meeting people in the real world? Was there supposed to be airline and hotel registration built in and it's been delayed? DAMN THAT CODER/ANIMATOR/MODELER/DESIGNER GUY! He should stay till 6 every night!</div></div><hr />

Most of that stuff you mentioned are different department teams. As for what new pets do to extend gameplay, well if you are in to them a lot. I am a collector of all kinds of stuff in game. My biggest collections are mounts and pets however. In that the hunt for new pets is always exciting as I compete with others on the server to who gets them first. I recently lost the race to 100 pets by 1 pet x.X But the more the merrier to me.<br />
<br />
As for idleing in Dal, I never do. Im always doing something. If not dailys or other quests, Im working on achievments, or farming for new pets while Im qued for a dungeon etc. There is always something to do in WoW as long as you don't limit yourself to the same two things. A open mind is an enriched mind.</div></div><hr />

If I understand it correctly, its an entirely different department working on pets, independent from all others. Meaning everyone is doing what they're supposed to do and the work on pets is in no way slowing down other issues being fixed.<br />

Then again I might have false info since I don't work for Blizzard, but even so...</div></div><hr />

Thats why I loved to play with their project, diablo and war series, etc..<br />
<br />
I know this is just an ingame pet, but the ideology must be kept anyway.<br />
And this is still not a Pandaren. If you are wondering how does a Pandaren look like, check Warcarft3 series, or the previous wow Pandaren minipet topic (http://www.mmo-champion.com/index.php?topic=101247.15), on this site. There are some screenshots aswell about the REAL Pandarens from War3. Pandarens originally have wide faces and a lot more things that made them really funny characters.<br />

<br />
Although, the kung-fu animation of this pet looks really ass-kickingly awesome, this is still a Tuskar in monk clothies with kung-fu animations. Blizzard should name this pet as &quot;Tuskarr Monk&quot;, since it absolutely nothing to do with the Pandarens.<br />
<br />
This is Tuskar. Cheap.<br />
<br />
Dont be cheap! Gief a real Pandaren pet! I would love it!</div></div><hr />

Companies don't quite work like that. Let's say you had 5 designers and 5 programmers* and you suddenly needed more design work done than programming, you don't tell your programmers to drop their keyboards and pick up a mouse.<br />

Advertising-free, this publication will feature something for everyone: lore, behind-the-scenes, raiding and pvp tips, and a focus on the community. In fact, the first issue, slated for release late this fall, will examine the trend of collecting non-combat pets, exploring how these companions have become so popular with the player base.<br />

Not really...<br />
I remember browsing the preWOTLK forums and reading about this problem over and over again.<br />
Everyone expected Blizzard to finally update their old character models because they look like shit... but they didn't.<br />
Why would they do it now? Revamping Azeroth and 2 new races is more work then just adding Northrend to the game.<br />
I still wonder if they will revamp azeroth totally or just a bit?<br />
What I'm trying to say is, stop saying Blizz will fix the old models... they probably won't and hoping for it will end in a major dissapointment.<br />
<br />
The pet is awesome btw.<br />
But will be probably from TCG or Magazine.<br />
Why would they put so much effort in it?<br />
So everybody wants it and is willing to pay a lot of money for it.<br />
Whatever keeps their business running, but can you blame them? (Yes :P!)<br />

They stated not all areas are going to be affected by physical change, but most are being leveled out as to how blizz wants their leveling to be.<br />

no. don't do it. it will not make you happy. instead, after some time has passed, you will be even more frustrated than you are now. people that play for loot will stop playing soon. people that play for fun, well, they will keep going on. but heck, maybe you buy a new car just because it has this cool &quot;snoopy figures behind the windscreen&quot;..<br />

Can't deny I wouldn't prefer a new run animation. Or model re-design. God those orcs look fugly. Should be more mean, so to speak. <br />

<br />
I agree with you. I would LOVE to see new and/or redone animations for all races. Preferably Night Elf males, human males, etc. Their running and combat animations look goofy. I want to see some ninja moves for rogues (lol), new casting animations for all races and what not.</div></div><hr />

I doubt it, it's bind on account, which would be only the 2nd pet ingame to be BoA, the other one being the Baby Blizzard Bear, which makes me wonder if they decided to give us this one this year, and make the Onyxia whelp a gift for simply fighting her again.</div></div><hr />

Couldn't agree more. Game is full of these 'achievers', collecting pets and mounts. Yay, I'm so special now, I have... let's count guys, anyone counting with me? I know you care so much about how many pets and mounts I have, so let's see, 1...3...4...

- The Chinese Promotion for starting up WoW again after the server switch<br />
- The WoW Magazine. <br />
- The *Way too early* Cataclysm Pet, which has always been a Whelpling (the xpacks anyway), so I'd think they're going to make this year's CE pet a Twilight Whelpling or something instead, but ok. <br />
<br />
Then, looking at the little &quot;Ni Hao&quot; and the chinese style of the pet, I am afraid It'll be the first one. Which would mean that Blizzard only whips out the good animators when they're trying to attract as many customers as possible, lol. We'll see.</div></div><hr />

People who pretend vanilla WoW was utopia either never played it back then, or forget the difficulty level was scaled thanks to bad design rather than &quot;epic fights&quot;. That aside, WoW has always been about epic loot and showing it off, be it armor or vanity pets, achievements are just one more way to polish your character.</div></div><hr />

It's a game and people play it for different reasons. You don't have the extensive out of combat fun things in Ultima Online, but you do have some things like this. <br />

I get more joy out of idiot PVP achievements than some scripted pve achievement but seeing that popup spam on my screen sometimes makes me chuckle. <br />

I hope the Panda monk is hard to get, or at least time consuming. It wouldn't really be that cool if you log in and go &quot;farm&quot; it and get it within 15 minutes and then you go to Dalaran to show it off but before you can even activate him you see 127 already there kung fu fighting the other little monks.</div></div><hr />

You won't be able to farm it period, it's bind on account, so it's either a CE pet or a promotional pet. Otherwise it'd be BOE or BOP. So in a way you'll get your wish :P. Plus, blizz would never make it an &quot;easy to get&quot; pet because they know that everyone would use this pet for a long time due to its awesome animations.

Hi there, Dorque (or I guess they call you Dork on vent, assuming you play this piece of crap &quot;game&quot;). I'm completely relaxed whilst posting this, I let people play &quot;their game&quot; for sure, but blizzard certainly doesn't. They're sellouts, and doesn't give a shit about their costumers anymore (well not for warcraft at least), uninspired new features such as the achievement system was stolen from Halo or whatever. It totally made me quit.<br />
<br />
And I have a degree, a solid one, I also have a job, actually I have two jobs + that I'm a student, life's good for me. So please don't come here and think that you're the special one having a degree 'and all', big boy now aren't you? And just because I mention some factors concerning a game on a GAMING forum shouldn't let you or any fucking nerd be able to respond with your real life 'achievements' which, unfortunately for you, doesn't impress anyone in here, or in real life. It's common to have this at a certain point, so take a big step back and literally fuck your own face.</div></div><hr />

Actually, Alv, I don't have a degree or a job right now. I just don't like to see people getting in other peoples' faces about what they consider an achievement. Especially in a game. They have a right to play and enjoy however they want, and you do NOT have a right to say all of what you said. <br />

Its a tanking &quot;nerf&quot; in a tree that no one actually ever uses for tanking. Its not a huge deal. Besides I hesitate to call it a nerf because even with fewer charges the duration became one minute, so all in all I want to call it a balance.</div></div><hr />

Something cool to look at. Not everyone plays this game to spend 20+ hours a week staring at raiding content. Some of us play for fun instead of progression. For those of us at play for fun we enjoy having something cool to look at that isn't related to raiding content.<br />

Oh, and I'll cut you off before you come back with you sucky newb learn not to suck and WoW is about raiding.

If you followed the drama at all you would realize the only reason that there isn't a Panderan race in the next expansion is because China HATES the idea.

<br />
THIS IS NOT A DK NERF! Yes, it gives the bone shield less bones, but everything else is left alone except the timer. The timer doesn't share a cool down with any of the other absorption methods. So in short, DKs are being buffed in PvP because all of their timers are becoming one minute and they will be able to chain cool downs again. They will just be changing cool downs that have been weekend a little bit, but its still an overall buff to the cool downs.<br />
<br />
God, I love how this DK hate normally comes from a freaking rogue. They just can't handle sharing the spotlight of most overpowered pvp class now can they? Seriously, Blizzard doesn't nerf for PvP or stun lock would have been taken out of the game 5 years ago.</div></div><hr />

You know Blizzard, right? they listen to their players. And well, if I went into details this would become way too much information in one post. And to be quite frank with you I actually don't care much about this little conversation that we're running now. So I won't tell you about how Blizzard takes their decisions when it comes to their playerbase and their on-going feature releases (which is totally uninspired and uninteresting). I assume you already know what I'm talking about. I'm on the other side (which means I don't think like these casuals), I didn't want these casual changes. And you can't honestly call world of warcraft a game anymore. It revolves around this goddamn achievement system. Content releases resulting in &quot;hard-modes&quot; is just bullshit in my opinion and I laugh at those who think this is a great idea.<br />
<br />
This is the nerve you said you hit. You're one of those who doesn't understand what this game really can provide, but they chose to listen to their puny casuals that consists of probably 80% of the playerbase and decided to release a 'sims-system' instead.<br />

Unless you personally suck at playing your class you are talking about the two classes that consistently top the charts in PvE, so they don't need love other than that of the nerf bat variety, and don't worry Blizzard has plenty of that sort of tough love lined up to come your way.</div></div><hr />

I don't know about you, but I personally took back 20 hours a week when I quit raiding. Sure, I wasn't giving up my entire life, but those 20 hours were enough. I would rather spend 20 hours of my night time actually sleeping instead of raiding. That way when I go to work the next day I'm well rested and can actually do my job.

Well you're a nerd already, you shouldn't be allowed to say that after continuing your post with such a nerdy comment. Back to your nerd cave and collect more 'special pets', since they are so 'fun' and 'entertaining'. Read the whole post again actually, you're hugely pathetic.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'm willing to bet that there are more people that collect pets then there are hardcore raiders, so DEAL WITH IT!<br />
This doesn't make any sense at all. Fuck people like you. :-*</div></div><hr />

Causal money and hardcore money is all the same. If a drunken samurai panda is unbefitting of you then just shut up and don't take the drop. I only care about the thing if I can play as it. Non combat pets serve no purpose excedpt to brag. When it comes to that I don't care. If you want to brag come prancing into stormwind with your epic/rare mount.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't honestly mind them being from the card game, because the card game can be enjoyed outside of World of Warcraft. My biggest problem has always been things like collector's editions. I don't want to pay $20 more for a cute in game pet and some box that will end up in the same place the box from the normal game ended up at anyways.<br />
<br />
Not to mention, seriously, adding these to the card game boosts the hell out of the card game because to be perfectly honest with you if I got one of the $1000 cards from the card game I'd be putting it on eBay not in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is because they buffed it to nerf it. Its still in a better situation then it was. It was obvious that paladin tanks would be balanced again. For awhile now all tanks that weren't paladins were being overlooked by groups. Whenever that happens inspect incoming nerfs. Heroic dungeons wanted paladin tanks and raids wanted DK tanks. Both of those are getting &quot;balanced&quot; while warriors and druids are being buffed. Its not a coincidence.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Lol, elitism about spending gold on the AH. MMKAY! You can hit the 100 pets achievement by doing 2 level 55 quests, quests that only come around every special event (so that takes a little while), and by spending around 5-10k on the AH. Now, that is an achievement! :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
+15% on chain lightning. Look to see chain lightning back in your single target rotation again just like in TBC. Still, its probably not going to buff elemental shamans to be on par with &quot;pure&quot; dps classes, but then again Blizzard has said over and over that they are not supposed to be on par with &quot;pure&quot; dps classes.</div></div><hr />

Why would they do it now? Revamping Azeroth and 2 new races is more work then just adding Northrend to the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Actually, updating Azeroth and adding two new races is less work than implementing the dk. Adding new classes is a LOT of work. Now would be the time to do it. Besides, DAoC (who had like 1/3 of the staff of Blizzard) put out a complete race overhaul with an expansion where they added two races and a few new pieces of land.</div></div><hr />

What are your wishes ?<br />
<br />
<br />
Let me answer for them. Their wishes are to stroke their epeens in game by being &quot;hardcore&quot; and they don't realize the majority of people look at you being &quot;hardcore&quot; in a game and think its a level of stupidity not a level of epeen.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I love how people embellish. You have two jobs? That means you can't pay your bills with one job. So either you have a lot of babie's mamas to take care of or both your jobs are just meaningless grind fests. You have a solid degree yet you are going back to school? You know, next time you try to embellish do it in a way that doesn't make anyone reading between the lines jump right to the real story.</div></div><hr />

Oh wow, someone is a little unhappy aren't they? Go ahead and insult me all you want. It makes me laugh. I rather enjoy it. You must truly be some miserable person to need to attack people on the internet that do not agree with you. So sorry you can't handle the truth, but that is your problem not mine!</div></div><hr />

You can pray as much as you like, the Onyxia whelpling will still be the 5th anniversary pet.</div></div><hr />

You're one of those who doesn't understand what this game really can provide, but they chose to listen to their puny casuals that consists of probably 80% of the playerbase and decided to release a 'sims-system' instead.<br />
<br />
And about me being offensive, deal with it I dunno actually, doesn't prove that I'm 'sad' :-----]<br />
<br />
<br />
I do understand what the game can provide - and I do agree with you. Blizz has gone way downhill lately, more concerned about money than the playerbase. On the flip side of that, I currently enjoy playing casually and the number of casuals is greater by far than the number of hardcore players.<br />
<br />
I'm all for seeing them add content for the entire playerbase. I just don't think it's fair to be nasty to the players who enjoy one form of content over another. ~shrugs~<br />
<br />
::EDIT:: If you want to hear my big complaint, it's that if you don't raid, you can't get the weapons to PvP. I can't really compete in arena as a rogue because Blizz won't give me any nice weapons unless I raid, and I don't really want to raid. So, yeah, I know there are issues.</div></div><hr />

The 5th anniversary pet I am pretty sure is going to be an Onyxia whelpling. But this new Panda pet is BoA as it seems. Last I knew, the Collectors Edition and other pets were BoA, so here is hoping for it to be part of the Cataclysm Collector's Edition.</div></div><hr />

Of course, it is BoA apparantly, but even then - perhaps Blizzard is showing some extra reward for getting so many pets if my idea was indeed correct?</div></div><hr />
