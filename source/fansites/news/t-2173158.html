have there been any ideas to make galakras in SoO skippable so we can actually solo it. Much like the valithria encounter in icc<br />
Have you tried it recently? Patch 7.1 should have let you bring the drake down with a single cannon. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/831243393267142658))<br />

No highmountain tribes in over a week yet we've had the dreamweavers twice, why is this system so screwed up?<br />
In a system with 7 entries, some fortnights you can have the cycle be ABCDEFG|EDFCGBA, A being Highmountain. Because math. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831651625609551872))<br />
It would be better to have emissaries set as days to ensure rep dispersion across the factions than having no emissary for a week+<br />
This system already ensures even distribution of all emissaries over time. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831653735113764864))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
We have riding mounts, flying mounts and swimming ones. Have you guys ever thought about a new type? Climbing? Leaping?<br />
mounts should be able to roll affixes like items, so you can get a leaping white stallion or a vicious frolicking war turtle (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831179522250649600))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What makes wow the best? What is it about wow that no other MMORPG got right?<br />
The biggest challenge in my mind for MMO design is being able to create stuff for players to do faster than they can consume it.<br />
<br />
Even WoW canâ€™t solve that problem completely, but it was the closest I have ever seen. WoW always gave players a ton of things to do. Not only were there dozens of quest zones, but you could actually go do them all without having to find a group first. In previous MMOs, youâ€™d hit the point where youâ€™re intended to just go slaughter frogs or whatever to gain the next level. WoW never hit those dry points. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you did find a group, there were dungeons to run or BGs to jump into. At launch, just looking behind waterfalls or trying to get up cliffs where we werenâ€™t supposed to go was fairly entertaining. <br />
<br />
A lot of people, including me, like to point out the ridiculous level of polish that Blizzard puts into games, and I definitely think that is part of WoWâ€™s secret sauce. But for me, the reason I kept playing, is that after Redridge, there was Stranglethorn to explore, and after I got tired of my hunter, there as a priest to try, and after I was sick of UBRS, I could try my hand at LBRS. And then I discovered raiding, and whole new ways to play were on the table. And when I wasnâ€™t raiding, I needed to farm flasks and Whipper Root Tubers or see if I could get the shield to drop in UBRS. Or I could work on my engineering or I could consider grinding factions. Or I could see if there was any PvP happening around Tyrâ€™s Hand. Or try Dire Maul. And just when I was sick of wiping to Naxxramas, an expansion was announced.<br />
<br />
Like a lot of players, my WoW-playing started to shift from just logging on to see what was happening to logging on only for raid nights or the like. But I donâ€™t think I would have developed those friendships if I hadnâ€™t already been spending so much time in the game before that point.<br />
<br />
I played a lot of games like Civilization, XCOM and Diablo before I discovered WoW, but I felt like I had seen everything there was to see in those games pretty quickly, even though I stuck with them. With WoW, there was always the sense that I was going to discover a new troll ruin or a new rare drop or see some rare spawn for the first time. I also didnâ€™t want to miss out if I heard about my friends seeing all of that stuff the one night I chose not to log in.

For the paladins its per race<br />
As they are named alliance and horde. So yea you can obtain all. But they are colour wise based on the faction. Like the old mounts</div></div><hr />

Probably just my crazy self talking.<br />
<br />
The Rogue mount is shit. Should have been some kind of SI:7 infiltration kite</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menz</div><div class="date">2017-02-22, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you new to WoW? Since they often make multiple recolours of Items/Mounts that never actually make it in game.<br />
<br />
I have been around since WoTLK. I don't think one of those will not make it to the game. I strongly feel all four will be there, which is strange.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caaethil</div><div class="date">2017-02-22, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, what is the deal with these mounts? Is there any information out there as to how these will be dealt out to specs/races? There are a lot more than four rogue races (unlike with paladins). Is it just one of the specs having Alliance/Horde variants?<br />
<br />
The only thing I can imagine is Alliance Outlaws get green, and Horde Outlaws get red. Seems strange though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crookids</div><div class="date">2017-02-22, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not bad, but does anyone else feel like it's a bit of a missed opportunity?<br />
<br />
I mean, I feel like there could have been something cooler that involves the uniqueness of a Rogue. Perhaps something that makes you look like you're stealth while riding, a parrot mount for Outlaw or a bat for subtlety.</div></div><hr />

It's how they get their jet propulsion.</div></div><hr />

Wish they would make kara chess skippable, still RNG'd as fuck<br />
<br />
<br />
Four mounts, three specs... Strange.<br />
<br />
Just re-colours man, they do this with tier sets too.</div></div><hr />

Four colors - one core color, one for maxing out each of the weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also funny how this mount doesn't walk on the floor :P oh and the loop the loop animation anyone can do that just hold insert, press and hold W :) xxxx<br />
<br />
It's a good idea but i'd rather have the models used to update SFF :)</div></div><hr />

The twitch one is slow, unstable and takes forever to change quality to anything higher than 480p.<br />

<br />
Blizzard: Can you PLEASE, remove that stupid &quot;nightcap&quot; piece of raggedy cloth from it's head? Thank you. I want a raven, not meme material.</div></div><hr />
