have there been any ideas to make galakras in SoO skippable so we can actually solo it. Much like the valithria encounter in icc<br />
Have you tried it recently? Patch 7.1 should have let you bring the drake down with a single cannon. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/831243393267142658))<br />

No highmountain tribes in over a week yet we've had the dreamweavers twice, why is this system so screwed up?<br />
In a system with 7 entries, some fortnights you can have the cycle be ABCDEFG|EDFCGBA, A being Highmountain. Because math. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831651625609551872))<br />
It would be better to have emissaries set as days to ensure rep dispersion across the factions than having no emissary for a week+<br />
This system already ensures even distribution of all emissaries over time. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831653735113764864))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
We have riding mounts, flying mounts and swimming ones. Have you guys ever thought about a new type? Climbing? Leaping?<br />
mounts should be able to roll affixes like items, so you can get a leaping white stallion or a vicious frolicking war turtle (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/831179522250649600))<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
What makes wow the best? What is it about wow that no other MMORPG got right?<br />
The biggest challenge in my mind for MMO design is being able to create stuff for players to do faster than they can consume it.<br />
<br />
Even WoW can’t solve that problem completely, but it was the closest I have ever seen. WoW always gave players a ton of things to do. Not only were there dozens of quest zones, but you could actually go do them all without having to find a group first. In previous MMOs, you’d hit the point where you’re intended to just go slaughter frogs or whatever to gain the next level. WoW never hit those dry points. <br />
<br />
On the other hand, if you did find a group, there were dungeons to run or BGs to jump into. At launch, just looking behind waterfalls or trying to get up cliffs where we weren’t supposed to go was fairly entertaining. <br />
<br />
A lot of people, including me, like to point out the ridiculous level of polish that Blizzard puts into games, and I definitely think that is part of WoW’s secret sauce. But for me, the reason I kept playing, is that after Redridge, there was Stranglethorn to explore, and after I got tired of my hunter, there as a priest to try, and after I was sick of UBRS, I could try my hand at LBRS. And then I discovered raiding, and whole new ways to play were on the table. And when I wasn’t raiding, I needed to farm flasks and Whipper Root Tubers or see if I could get the shield to drop in UBRS. Or I could work on my engineering or I could consider grinding factions. Or I could see if there was any PvP happening around Tyr’s Hand. Or try Dire Maul. And just when I was sick of wiping to Naxxramas, an expansion was announced.<br />
<br />
Like a lot of players, my WoW-playing started to shift from just logging on to see what was happening to logging on only for raid nights or the like. But I don’t think I would have developed those friendships if I hadn’t already been spending so much time in the game before that point.<br />
<br />
I played a lot of games like Civilization, XCOM and Diablo before I discovered WoW, but I felt like I had seen everything there was to see in those games pretty quickly, even though I stuck with them. With WoW, there was always the sense that I was going to discover a new troll ruin or a new rare drop or see some rare spawn for the first time. I also didn’t want to miss out if I heard about my friends seeing all of that stuff the one night I chose not to log in.

For the paladins its per race<br />
As they are named alliance and horde. So yea you can obtain all. But they are colour wise based on the faction. Like the old mounts</div></div><hr />

Probably just my crazy self talking.<br />
<br />
The Rogue mount is shit. Should have been some kind of SI:7 infiltration kite</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Menz</div><div class="date">2017-02-22, 01:28 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Are you new to WoW? Since they often make multiple recolours of Items/Mounts that never actually make it in game.<br />
<br />
I have been around since WoTLK. I don't think one of those will not make it to the game. I strongly feel all four will be there, which is strange.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Caaethil</div><div class="date">2017-02-22, 02:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, what is the deal with these mounts? Is there any information out there as to how these will be dealt out to specs/races? There are a lot more than four rogue races (unlike with paladins). Is it just one of the specs having Alliance/Horde variants?<br />
<br />
The only thing I can imagine is Alliance Outlaws get green, and Horde Outlaws get red. Seems strange though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Crookids</div><div class="date">2017-02-22, 02:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not bad, but does anyone else feel like it's a bit of a missed opportunity?<br />
<br />
I mean, I feel like there could have been something cooler that involves the uniqueness of a Rogue. Perhaps something that makes you look like you're stealth while riding, a parrot mount for Outlaw or a bat for subtlety.</div></div><hr />

It's how they get their jet propulsion.</div></div><hr />

Wish they would make kara chess skippable, still RNG'd as fuck<br />
<br />
<br />
Four mounts, three specs... Strange.<br />
<br />
Just re-colours man, they do this with tier sets too.</div></div><hr />

Four colors - one core color, one for maxing out each of the weapons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also funny how this mount doesn't walk on the floor :P oh and the loop the loop animation anyone can do that just hold insert, press and hold W :) xxxx<br />
<br />
It's a good idea but i'd rather have the models used to update SFF :)</div></div><hr />

The twitch one is slow, unstable and takes forever to change quality to anything higher than 480p.<br />

<br />
Blizzard: Can you PLEASE, remove that stupid &quot;nightcap&quot; piece of raggedy cloth from it's head? Thank you. I want a raven, not meme material.</div></div><hr />
