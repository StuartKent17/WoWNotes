The Celestial Steed mount costs 20€ (EU Store (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221003877))/$25 (US Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100000942)). <br />
The Lil' XT companion pet costs 10€ (EU Store (http://eu.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=221003878))/$10 (US Store (http://us.blizzard.com/store/details.xml?id=1100000943)).<br />
<br />
Celestial Steed and Lil'XT to be sold in the Blizzard Store<br />
According to the Blizzard store, the Lil' XT (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54847/lil-xt/) companion pet and the Celestial Steed (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/54811/celestial-steed/) mounts will be available from the Blizzard Store! This is the first time Blizzard sells a mount through the Blizzard store, we don't have the price yet but we can assume we'll hear about it very soon.<br />
<br />
The Celestial Steed seems to scale depending on your existing mounts. If you already have a 310% flying mount, the celestial steed will be a 310% as well. If you don't, it will just be a regular 280% flying mount. (or 150% if you never bought the epic flying skill)<br />

<br />
It's just a very annoying way (towards the customer) to make money in my opinion. This stuff should be attainable in game as well. I understand lots of people are hyped to get this. <br />
<br />
It's obvious that the stuff that's being sold on the store is getting more attention then the items ingame right now. Why are there no vanity pets like the ones in the store ingame?</div></div><hr />

But it makes me very scared what they will plan for next cashing stragety... Because the monthly fee and very high cost for xpansions (atleast for europe 50e+ in Finland) is already quite high.<br />
<br />
it makes me very scared, that after a while there wil be sold for real money like bags of potions/ flasks / xp boosters / fancy clothing for festivals etc etc cool stuff... And maybe someday actual gear. :'(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Welcome to maplestory.<br />
<br />
<br />
Why do people think this!? Seriously!<br />
<br />
Why would Blizzard sell you gear, which at the moment, people are working their asses off for in ICC? It's what keeps them paying for their subscription. Selling gear would be a completely retarded marketing strategy which will never happen.<br />
<br />
Blizzard will never sell things that provide in-game benefit in the Blizzard store. Cosmetic items such as mounts, pets and the like do not provide an in-game advantage over any other player. Unless you really care that someone has a cool mount that you can't have because you maxed out your credit card.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On one hand, this is a very cool mount. To me Ulduar will be the instance I loved the most in WotLK and this mount brings back memories every time I see it.<br />
<br />
On the other, if they're gonna charge $50 for it like some suggested, that's like the cost of an expansion. No way I'm throwing that much money into a vanity item.<br />
<br />
And then again, this is a very cool mount. :-\</div></div><hr />

Thing you can buy are awesome, but won't affect actual gameplay thus you are not forced to buy these to stay competitive. Also this way buying something actually feels good instead of being mandatory.</div></div><hr />

Well obviously they want to make money but they could've released literally any old crap and idiots would pay for it regardless. <br />

It's really simple, people hate not being able to get free stuff. As long as you can get it without paying extra, even though you have to keep grinding for it, you'll be happy. That's all it comes down to. Ok, people can get the celestial steed, good for them, it's a cool mount but so's a nether drake. Everybody has both. What makes a mount worth having is how rare it is. The people who get Invincible will always be looked on with more awe than those who just buy a similar model off the Blizzard store.</div></div><hr />

GEAR STORE!<br />
Why play to gear up when you can pay?<br />
<br />
<br />
To compare a mount wich gives you no advantage other then it looks cool with gear kinda proves how stupid ppl are...<br />
They will never sell something that gives you an advantage ingame, this mount gives you no advantage what so ever, it's only cosmetical...<br />
Why even complain about something that will never affect you in any way shape or form?<br />

Anywhoo, they are a company, and companies sell stuff, and this company sells stuff optionally, and the stuff they sell won't make you any better in ICC or give you a 2400 rating in Arenas.<br />
Half of the people complaining here would never get the mount in game if it was indeed a super-rare (or hard) drop anyway. So would you be completely satisfied at the guy/gal halfway across the world that's AFK in Dal showing off his glossy-ass Invincible?</div></div><hr />

Agreed. Someone who plays just for fun is less likely to spend real cash on a mount like this for the sake of e-peen.<br />

Becouse they spam, destroys the game, lagg's the server AND WORST OFF ALL they hack people to sell their gear and make more money...<br />
<br />
Blizzard has the best customercare of ANY mmo, possibly of any gamer ever..<br />
If your account get's hack'd it dosnt take long before all your stuff is back, all your gold, even that little stack off useless grey item's get's back to you!<br />
Any they put enormous amount of time to help ppl get back your hacked accounts, and that must cost a shitload of money!<br />
<br />
So, my point is... Maybe the only way to get rid of goldsellers is for blizzard to sell gold themself, that would stop the accounthacking etc.</div></div><hr />

That absolutely doesn't correspond to my view of a multiplayer game, where you should need sort of skills to achieve something.<br />
<br />
Mounts for money... wo cares... the mounts for hard achievements are the ones counting.<br />
<br />
<br />
Indeed, the true big guns will be found running around on Mimi's head, Invincible and the like.<br />
But no on the other hand. I'd say the mounts that count is a personal matter, similar to the ghost kitty back in the TCG day. You'll look cool and all, but that's it: you won't be looked upon as a great master of the game, or anything like that.<br />
<br />
Case in point: I'd be willing to put a little $$ on this to get rid of my proto-drake. I'll probably not get my hands on the uber mounts, so a cool-looking 310% will outdo the prot any day.<br />
<br />
NOW, if they allowed netherdrakes to be 310 when you had a 310 flyer...</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Anywhoo, they are a company, and companies sell stuff. Like the boxed game, like the monthly subscriptions, like faction race and server changes. This is the slippery slope and we're seeing it unfold slowly before our eyes.<br />
<br />
<br />
and this company sells stuff optionally, Every purchase is optional<br />
<br />
<br />
and the stuff they sell won't make you any better in ICC or give you a 2400 rating in Arenas. yet, and I laugh at 2400 rating being your &quot;good&quot; claim<br />
<br />
<br />
Half of the people complaining here would never get the mount in game if it was indeed a super-rare (or hard) drop anyway. So would you be completely satisfied at the guy/gal halfway across the world that's AFK in Dal showing off his glossy-ass Invincible? <br />
In game items costing real life money is a shitty, shitty thing for a pay monthly game and it's been going on in dribs and drabs. This is the first concrete move that really makes things pretty clear where blizzard is heading, and what they think they can get away with. People (like you) will defend them, buy the mount and allow them to make more mounts for sale, and perhaps additional in game items. It really is a slippery slope if anyone has been watching as long as I have, this is pay to acquire item #40 and there will be many more.</div></div><hr />

Probably because I already pay a subscription, and I want items to be available for the money I pay them, not having to pay extra for some extra cool stuff. The fact that they sell a cooler looking mount then one from HC of LK is bullshit.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Sulika</div><div class="date">2010-04-15, 10:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ah, so now it makes sense that they make it trivially easy for everyone in the game to get a full set of tier 10 gear. The less individuality it is possible to have from in game items the bigger a price they can gouge out of players by selling individuality online. <br />
<br />
Still, player numbers are, at best, holding steady and shareholders are never happy with &quot;remaining steady&quot; so it is only reasonable that Blizzard switch to slowly gouging every last penny out of their current players. <br />
<br />
I think selling the mount is a bad thing for the game, pets are a fun distraction but mounts have always been the prestige item awarded for in game success. Ashes of A'lar, Amani Warbear, the Argent Tournament mounts, Mimirons Head, the various achivement Frostwyrms, the rare drakes and so on up to Invincible have set a trend that the rare mount is a prestige item awarded for achieving difficult things in the game. By turning around and selling, basically one of the most impressive mounts in the game before the mount from which it is reskinned is even widely available very much trivialises in game accomplishments.<br />
<br />
There is also the point that I (and the rest of you too) pay a fairly hefty ($150 a year) subscription to this game. I play a subscription game because I find being constantly pressured to buy in-game items repulsive. If you look at a lot of free to play games they follow the same model, you can get everything of use in game but if you want to look good or individual you have to pay. A lot of the reasons I don't play those games is because I don't like that model, I don't want my game to be a walking advert for an in-game store. Paying to watch Blizzards product placement is not something I enjoy doing and while I will no doubt stay playing WoW because I enjoy it for the time being I will not be buying SC2 or D3 when they come out now. In WoW I already have a lot invested in the world but I for the first time pretty much in the history of Blizzard I won't be buying their new games. I just don't feel that paying to walk around their store is a good use of my money.</div></div><hr />

I can see people getting depressed about having to spend extra real life money for something in the game. Even in a game, the rich irl will get more out of the game than the poor (Means if you for example would want to collect mounts / pets etc).<br />

No, I said content to explore, not content which they lay out in front of you. I would like them spending time on making hidden caves, monsters and treasures, hidden locations to explore, hidden quests. As they did in vanilla. But I guess that requires to much fantasy.</div></div><hr />

At least 60% of the people who are complaining about the Steed being in the store will end up buying it. This is the thing now a days with online games. Look at the 360 or PS3 and the games with all the DLC you can order, pretty much the same thing, only differance is that we pay a subscription fee. Me...depending on the price I will probably buy this. I was already contemplating doing the RAF with myself so I could get the new mount.</div></div><hr />

I may very well buy the mount, depending on the price. I own the Pandaren monk, I thought that was a nice idea for a charity event. I also own the Horde windrider plush because well, it looks great :) <br />
<br />
I work 40 hours a week and earn a decent salary, so dropping £20 on this is less than a third of what I spend drinking with friends on a Friday night, for something I can enjoy in game over and over again. If you can't afford it, don't buy it. It doesn't change anything you receive for your monthly subscription at all, and it affords me no advantage. Its just another toy.<br />
<br />
I've been playing Blizzard games since Warcraft, I was 11 years old back then and I think when a company produces quality games for that long I'll support them throwing a bit more money there way than to some other company (I'm looking at you Ubisoft and Settlers 7!)</div></div><hr />

You're acting like the girl at the lemonade stand is charging an extra 15 cents because her lemonade is hand squeezed. This is a multi billion dollar company who has been making an absolute killing for multiple years looking to further squeeze us and in the process setting an industry standard for what companies can and will attempt to get away with. <br />
<br />
I will never understand people trying to defend blizzard making an extra buck, believe me as someone who has played this game high end for many years 15 bucks a month is more than enough to pay for the kind of content blizzard is putting out. If they want more money perhaps they should reinvest more back into the game and give people a better experience. <br />
<br />
Fix lag issues, additional instances cannot be launched, truly address the state of hardcore arena and raiding, adding real content not just a single instance stretching 4 modes of difficulty, and weapon/armor model and names that are unique and not shared over four different levels of gear. If blizzard was &quot;fund raising&quot; (lets face it this mount is clearly not fund raising for any cause other than gross income) to do something like that I think we can all pitch in for something we will all enjoy. This is a totally different breed of animal</div></div><hr />

It's just a person preference to me. I'll ride it around for a while and then when I finally get another cool mount (like finally a Green Proto-Drake or extremely lucky and find the Time Lost one first) I'll switch to that. I'll always cherish the mounts I earned through in game more than ones from TCG or now the store.<br />
<br />
What I don't get is.. people are going insane over this but I'm sure there are people who spent more than $3.99 US for a Spectral Tiger (the ones who were lucky to find it in the first pack) than the $300+ they spend on it now.<br />
<br />
Plus with this, I imagine it'll be a virtual sale which means they'll have an infinite number availble through the store. Oh well, I'll get it like the rest of the people who will and just like I did the pets (and Plushies w pets). No big deal. Of course I'd rather have some non virtual item to go along with it, maybe if Figure Prints would let you have a mount created (or better yet your character on the mount!)</div></div><hr />

Not everyone uses wowhead you know, and it wont help you find hidden places. None the less, Cata or not, I doubt it will have what I wishes for, so why is it brought up? What I am saying, they could have spend some time on making more depth to games content.</div></div><hr />

It sets an industry standard, as well as is a stepping stone for themselves to make more and more pay to acquire items that are eventually going to be a huge convenience or an actual in game advantage at some point. It's not a direction anyone wants this game to be going, and for those reasons alone you should have something more to say than &quot;I don't care&quot; or &quot;gimme&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, jeez, because Blizz isn't a company with the goal of making money, they're supposed to be our surrogate parents and shower us with purples when we each successfully wipe our bottoms.<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong, I'm not thrilled about more RMT stuff in the store, but seriously, no one bitches about the TCG stuff like this, so why are you bitching about Blizz?<br />
<br />
It's simple, if you don't like it, don't buy it. If enough people don't buy it, Blizz will get the message… oh, wait. No they won't. Because for every one of you QQers, 100 more people WILL buy it, happily and without complaint. ;D</div></div><hr />

You need to realise that Blizzard is more than one team of people.<br />
<br />
The people responsible for generating extra income are not the ones who are responsible for fixing the issues you name. (some of which have been fixed a while back...)<br />
<br />
<br />
This is basic economy people. Make more money. If you disagree, you have a strange look at this world. It's all about money, nothing is for free.<br />
<br />
And then there is also choice. Choose to buy it, or choose to not buy it. But don't complain about it just for the sake of complaining... This is just another load of QQ over nothing.</div></div><hr />

Capitalism made this, ergo; we made this possible.<br />
<br />
<br />
This a thousand times, nobody is forcing you to buy the mount or the pets, if someone wants to buy a vanity item that has little or zero influence on how you play the game. Blizzard have stated many times that they will NEVER sell gold, never sell gear as they have a real influence in-game. If people want to buy vanity items to eek that little bit more enjoyment from a game then let them, some people do not have access to the high-end mounts, yet pay the same subscription fee that you do, therefore they have as much right to a nice mount as you do. <br />
<br />
At the end of the day, blizzard is a company who wishes to make money, and having a niche such as the pet store is good for them. They are not in this business to please you, they are in this business to make money, but the work that they put into this game is absolutely amazing.<br />
<br />
So simple, dont like it, dont buy it :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's a difference between thinking of the long term effects and paranoia. <br />
It's a cool mount and that's it. It doesn't change your gameplay (or that of anyone else). Buy it if you want, don't if you don't want to.</div></div><hr />

I understand capitalism and I have seen blizzard sell the game (or their entire company) in pursuit of the bigger buck. Give me a break though Grimlor, my concerns are for the larger picture and where this is heading. This is one of many steps they have been making towards pay to acquire items. Do you really think it's going to stop here, and are you going to wait until it's something substantial and game changing to have an opinion on this? It's never been about the in game pets or in this case the mount, it's about the 'next' thing they are going to come up with and how it's eventually going to be something we must have or will be at a disadvantage or inconvenience to be without.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And it's bad becaaaaaaaause? Sorry, but that's economics 101 for you. If it sells, sell it. Wether you are the girl on that lemon stand or Blizzard has no impact on the concept. Had you said &quot;Blizzard is abusing its position&quot;, I'd agree (see Microsoft being bashed around, that's a good example). But here, they're doing business, period.

<br />
Decent points, but the basic premice remains the same: if it sells, they’re good. If it sells, the quality is sufficient for those that buy. Or maybe those guy’s definition of quality differs from yours or mine. And that doesn’t make their definition lesser than our own.<br />
<br />
Or to put it in aggressive Internet-style messages: “If you don’t like it, vote with your feet.”<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Fix lag issues, additional instances cannot be launched, truly address the state of hardcore arena and raiding, adding real content not just a single instance stretching 4 modes of difficulty, and weapon/armor model and names that are unique and not shared over four different levels of gear. If blizzard was &quot;fund raising&quot; (lets face it this mount is clearly not fund raising for any cause other than gross income) to do something like that I think we can all pitch in for something we will all enjoy. This is a totally different breed of animal<br />
<br />
<br />
Which is, as far as I can see, an ongoing process that is happening as we write, and has pretty much nothing to do with the mount. I’ll confess I’d love to see more on most of your points, but I wouldn’t link the mount with the current state of the game.</div></div><hr />

When that starts happening, sure I'll have a problem with it. I think it's bull shit to just buy your way to a high rank, or give yourself an advantage. But a mount that scales with your riding speed isn't going to give an advantage over anything. Right now people are too worried about what could happen in the future. And let's be honest, if people weren't whining about the RAF benefits, the heirloom items, or the TCG items, why would they be whining now? People like you and others act like you're some kind of expert financial analysts, that you can predict this shit. And who knows, maybe you're right, and maybe it will get to that point. But I'd be willing to bet you any money that any of the shit that you are talking about here, and it's effects on WoW would have already been considered before pushing through with this. Blizzard is smart. You can curse them all you want, but that's a fact. They know how to market their shit. What do you think is going to happen to their player base if they actually do start selling enhancing items for real money? You honestly don't think they've thought of that?</div></div><hr />

I like to complain about things that I don't like when they actually happen.<br />

I don't like to complain about things that could happen but haven't happened so far.<br />
<br />
There's the difference. I'm not naive, I just really don't see the point in complaining about things that could.<br />
<br />
I have an opinion about paying money for gear and/or for gold. It would destroy your, mine and everyone else's gameplay. However, this mount, that pet, the pets sold months ago, the mounts and pets that go for absurd amounts of money in ebay since the game launched... It's all irrelevant in that other discussion.</div></div><hr />

I already have a better mount that cost me nothing but time. <br />

I also hope blizzard make alot of money by charging a truckload, because a fool and his money are easily parted. <br />

I can see it on the loader splash screen now, when it appears nothing will drown out the sounds of a million. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sulfuric</div><div class="date">2010-04-15, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">And it's bad becaaaaaaaause? Sorry, but that's economics 101 for you. If it sells, sell it. Wether you are the girl on that lemon stand or Blizzard has no impact on the concept. Had you said &quot;Blizzard is abusing its position&quot;, I'd agree (see Microsoft being bashed around, that's a good example). But here, they're doing business, period. Basic right in pretty much every liberal economy.<br />
<br />
<br />
Decent points, but the basic premice remains the same: if it sells, they’re good. If it sells, the quality is sufficient for those that buy. Or maybe those guy’s definition of quality differs from yours or mine. And that doesn’t make their definition lesser than our own.<br />
<br />
Or to put it in aggressive Internet-style messages: “If you don’t like it, vote with your feet.”<br />
<br />
Which is, as far as I can see, an ongoing process that is happening as we write, and has pretty much nothing to do with the mount. I’ll confess I’d love to see more on most of your points, but I wouldn’t link the mount with the current state of the game.<br />
<br />
<br />
Extremely well written, I've been told I never concede a point however I prefer to concede to a viable point in which case you've offered me one. I understand that blizzard is a corporation, but they are not hurting for money, they don't need more and this money is not going to pay anyones salary this is straight bread and butter. The monthly income goes well above and beyond all operating costs this game faces, so it would be nice if people would realize that they are giving pity to someone who deserves none. Like I said before my only concerns is the next step from here, and what this is going to allow blizzard to do next. Am I the only guy who has been around for a long time and watched as this game has slowly allowed for a mount to be sold for real life money? Had you mentioned that years ago people would be up in arms, yet here we are today with people actually defending it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Please, do adress the whole point I'm bringing? There is no such thing as a &quot;hidden&quot; element in wow, never was. There was only elements for which information was scarce. Case in point: Invincible had been presumed to be a drop off Arthas in 25M here weeks before Blizz leaked anything about it, not even its existence. The ending of ICC was leaked the very hour it was patched in the game.<br />

You. Can't. Hide. Things.<br />

On the depth departement, they are busy (again, Cataclysm). Now, if you ask for more depth YOU would like to see, I can see you complaint, but that changes the entire premise of your complaint from &quot;they're doing NOTHING!&quot; to &quot;I like NOTHING they made.&quot;</div></div><hr />

So far they have claimed they will only sell vanity items, and if you look at mounts and pets, the TCG was not much different. Selling it directly through the store just removes the RNG.<br />
<br />
That said:<br />
<br />
LotRO, a game with a monthly fee sells extra character slots for money.<br />
<br />
Many socalled &quot;free&quot; browser games with in fact pretty shallow graphics and gameplay as you to purchase items to be cool or get anywhere with RL money..and funnily you can easily spend more than 13$ a month on that stuff.<br />
<br />
So really..I don't know what to think of this. I have actually given away pets from the Blizzard store as birthday presents to a very happy friend, and that mount looks damn awesome indeed.</div></div><hr />

If you're going to buy something everybody else has, then you're really buying it for yourself and for your own benefits right?

Mounts and pets earned through real life money = no skills though and thus no respect.<br />
<br />
<br />
Very few mounts in the game ever required skill anyway, so they were never a big deal to begin with. There's only a handful of mounts that are rare and those will always be a big deal. It's not like they're selling something like the Amani War Bear or the Spectral Tiger on the Blizzard Store. Making something widely available that used to be rare is a reason to be angry. This isn't one of those instances.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO The Pet store is a great way to cater to the casual player base, a lot of us that have you know real jobs and obligations can't raid Hard-modes, (hell it's hard enough to find time to raid for me personally atm.) that want to continue playing their fav hobby. I think anyone crying about this needs to grow up, there are tons of awesome mounts available in game via Raid achievements and Boss kills that the casual player-base will never see.<br />
<br />
For anyone arguing that casuals don't deserve it, that's a load of Bull. Just because some people have more time to play doesn't make them a better player. On the flip side of that coin sometimes they actually are, take the top guilds those guys get world first boss kills and yeah those guys are pretty god players. But almost all of them have all the awesome mounts. So I really think everyone QQing needs to take a step back look at their mount collection, and go &quot;okay Casuals can have this one. I've had all the other cool mounts in the game thus far.&quot;<br />
