When the 2.1.0 was released, Blizzard included a new feature in the patch : the battleground matchmaking system. The official description is &quot;This system allows the battleground to select teams of similar equipment quality and organizational level to battle each other. For now, the system will be very forgiving about creating matchups in order to keep queue times low. However, the parameters will be adjusted as necessary when more organized teams become active in the battlegrounds. &quot;<br />
<br />
But it doesn't seem to work, battlegrounds are still totally random, and there isn't any noticeable change ... So where is the matchmaking system ? Drysc answered that on the forums.<br />
<br />
It's in there, it's just extremely laid back in how picky it is, or in other terms: it's not going to take a long time to match people up. There aren't a very large number of players participating in battlegrounds at all times, at least not enough to tighten up the settings. We don't want to tune the system so that it's matching people really well at say... prime time on an AV weekend, and then have someone wanting to play on a Wednesday night at 4AM have to wait an hour or two to find a match. <br />
<br />
So there's really a couple contributing factors. Really first and foremost the only way we're going to be comfortable tuning the system to start forcing more specific matchups is if there's a larger number of consistent players interested in the battlegrounds. That is mostly based on the battlegrounds themselves, new battlegrounds coming, and probably ultimately how well they're incentivized. All things we're aware of, and all things that (AV changes, AFK reporting, queue changes, new battlegrounds, new rewards) we're seeing come to a solution at a single point on the horizon. <br />
<br />
Even at some point in the future where we could potentially pull the reins in a whole lot, and attempt to force extremely specific matchups, it's never going to be perfect. I don't believe we would ever get to the point where we're going to make you wait indefinitely just so that you never see a twink again, or a premade team, or someone with better gear than yourself. At that point you wouldn't care who you're up against, you just want to get in and get your mark, or get what honor you can. Getting in and fighting in a lopsided battle IS better than not fighting at all. <br />
<br />
It is working though, and loosely matching players up very quickly. It's one of those invisible under-the-stage mechanics though that you could easily assume does nothing at all unless it's perfect. <br />

Hyjal Summit<br />
Now, we know where the matchmaking system went, time to resolve another mystery ! Where is the Infinite Dragonflight in Hyjal ? Tons of speculation going because of the large part of the instance that remains unused (See our wonderful map (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/articles/instance/maps/map_hyjal.jpg)). But according to Drysc, they're just not here.<br />
<br />
It's a &quot;time pocket&quot; if you will. There's no intended link to the Infinite Dragonflight or their dastardly deeds of altered timeways, and you're not literally interacting with history. It's simply a way for players to experience some of the larger moments in Warcraft history, and admittedly the Mount Hyjal instance isn't really linked to the world for any rhyme or reason. The timeway presented itself, it's an amazing opportunity to be there and experience such a major event, and Archimonde drops phat purples.<br />

<br />
I would speculate that most people who enter a BG have the rewards in mind and probably not the fight. To this end, it's probably in Blizzards best interest to *say* that they have a fair match making system, but leave things exactly as they are so that grinders don't get stuck in long drawn out matches, and can instead maximise their Honour per hour.<br />
<br />
It's sad that PvP has been reduced to an even bigger farm than PvE, but trying to suggest it is anything else is folly. Roll on some decent, reliable and worthwhile World PvP!<br />
<br />
Mount Hyjal post seems lazy on Blizzards part. Don't get me wrong, it's a cool fight to see and be apart of, but that is not a good enough reason in my mind to distort the timeline and travel back. Doc Brown would not approve.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Fral</div><div class="date">2007-08-14, 11:52 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About Mount Hyjal,<br />
Before Burning Crusade there was the possibility of going to Hyjal by using a small jumping exploit.It was put there by Blizzard as a teaser for those curious of the future content.At the end of the road there were a couple of road signs who said &quot;Blizzard Co. Under Construction&quot; meaning that Blizzard left that specific opening intentionally.As for the 1st unopen part of the instance i can tell you it offers an unique variation of environment.In a ravine there was an instance portal which was blocked by a stone wall similar to the one at Onyxia.However using the mage sheep exploit and a warlock(me) to summon the rest we got past the wall and went inside.The place is the exact mirror of the Onyxia Lair .It was completely empty.As for the rest of the region it seemed at a final phase of development without and terrain bugs and stuff like that.With TBC the terrain exploit was removed unfortunetly.<br />
As a conclusion I can only speculate and say that the place is a future region rather than an instance because of it's diversity and possibilities and also because of the presence of the raid instance portal there.It also had a place which somehow seemed like the future placement of a minor town.I will try and see if I can get my hands on the photos( I have mad quite a dozen).</div></div><hr />

<br />
With no interference from the infinite dragonflight, we shouldn't need to do anything. If the entire raid /afk'ed, the good guys should still overcome the Legion. It would make more sense if Blizzard at least cooked up some BS about the infinites disguising and joining with the Legion to swell their numbers so that the plan would fail and Archimonde would arrive too soon and win. No need to put the actual dragons in the instance, but at least acknowledge they're trying to influence events, otherwise why should success depend on the players?

<br />
Whatever the reason, i'm glad we get to see this battle and participate. I understand what you mean about how the good guys should win with the raid being afk, but what fun would that be? They could just say this guy and this guy are empowered by the infinite flight, but in the end, it's the same guy, and he drops the same stuff, and the coolest part of the fight isn't ruined by a bit of lack of lore after all, is it? I mean, do you not enjoy kill Archimonde?</div></div><hr />

Maybe it is a time paradox????? As in if this group of raiders never go back in time to experience the Battle for Mount Hyjal encounter then the Legion would have won! The fact that support this theory is the suicidal behavior of all the allied NPC's in Hyjal and I am very confident that if we raiders never went back in time to complete our Tier 6 sets that Thrall if anyone would have died.</div></div><hr />

That points to the last question in my post. If it's a &quot;we have to go back because we were there&quot; situation, then those are some pretty big guns to just be anonymous footsoldiers/riflemen/healers/sorcerors/whatever.</div></div><hr />

Nah. With all that our adventurers accomplish throught Azeroth and Outland and the powers we weild, I refuse to accept that we are just faceless grunts like that, especially in that situation where the majority of the success is due to our efforts. We'd stand out among the countless others there that rush in and get crushed and we'd be recognized for our contribution to the battle.<br />
<br />
Besides any of that, it would just make more sense if they just said that the infinite flight is there but masking their presence so the instance is more in keeping with the rest of CoT.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Juju</div><div class="date">2007-08-17, 02:59 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">All I gotta say about pvp is that bg's are kind of a joke at the moment (in my battlegroup anyways), and not only in AV... I can't wait for blizz to release that pvp zone in Northrend comes next expansion, I really hope they make it worth it for everyone to fight hard for it (although this might mean lagg... but still). Tho only occasional decent pvp these days has to be proveked with killing a few lowbies so they ask people to come help them (I'm sorry lowbies, it's nothing personal) in Netherstorm or Shadowmoon, or the good old Gate of Orgrimar, but then after a while horde get stupid and u and your two buddies end up fleeing from 45 enraged horde...<br />
I kinda wish people started raiding citites again... or make people able to kill each other in Shatt (I have a really cool idea for that ^^: don't make horde vs ally, but rather Scryers VS Aldor :-D, withn only the middle with Ad'al or w/e as a sanctuary (no fighting), but that's just me wishing).<br />
As for the Hyjal fight, well I was a bit curious as to why Blizz didn't put the Infinite flight there at first, but yea, I guess if you really want a story, the one with us being there in the past because we just were (the bronze had sent us and we didn't even know!!!) could make sense, and we wouldn't really be remembered since, well, few were in that battle anyways (leaders mainly).</div></div><hr />
