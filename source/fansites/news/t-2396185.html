Maybe something linked to your blizzard account? Although it is easy to get one, it is an extra step to deter the bulk buyers.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TickerDS</div><div class="date">2018-05-10, 12:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">While there are clearly some scalpers bogging down the market and eating up a % of the tickets....it is also that the tickets are just THAT popular...and if you really want to go you have to plan ahead and get a group of people in on the effort. <br />
<br />
I am now on year 6 of going in a row and have gotten all the tickets my group has needed on the first day each year. Year one we took 5 people, year 2 was 10, year 3 a whopping 22, year 4 20, year 5 we got 19, and this year we got 16. <br />
<br />
Its not as easy as just clicking and buying....this year we had 9 people trying and 4 got in, 5 did not. Most years we have had 9-12 people actively trying...and you have to be ready, planning ahead with everyone ready to go right at the flip of the clock -- reading the instructions ahead of time regarding having to select quantity before or after clicking buy, do you refresh the page or not, ext....but if you really want to go, you go through the effort of getting a team together to do it and you can get it done.<br />
<br />
Also a word of advice, stick around and try again at the 5, 10, and 15 minute mark after the tickets &quot;sell out&quot;, as credit cards fail and people cancel orders. Wait until the vendor turns off the system to stop. One year we got 3 more tickets about 15 min after they sold out, presumably because someone cancelled out or a payment failed. <br />
<br />
Not excusing the scalpers, but just saying if you REALLY want to go, get some help together ahead of time and be ready and you can get your ticket. <br />
<br />
Another pro tip. One year we had someone decide the day of the con that they wanted to go....so they came with and waited out front that morning and someone sold their pass at face value minus the loot box because someone backed out and could not make it. Every year there are groups with a person that could not make it, missed a flight, ext selling the pass at cost. You just make them go to the name change line before you buy it and get them to change the badge to your name. Does not help if you live far away of course, but just fyi for those who are close to the con. Also the week or so before the con, the scalper pricing on ebay does normally drop, as again those selling tickets are a combo of scalpers and those trying to ditch an extra ticket that someone backed out of last minute, so you can ebay for around cost around then too.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Twdft</div><div class="date">2018-05-10, 02:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This is how I think Blizzard should do it: have an option in account setting to opt in for Blizzcon tickets. 2 tickets max per account, account holder name must be confirmed by some kind of ID (like you have to provide when you lose your password to get the account back), and linked to credit/debit card. Account has to have at least some kind of regular activity in one of the Blizzard games to be eligible. A week before the sale every account has to click some button &quot;yeah I still wanna go&quot;, at time of sale Blizzard chooses randomly who gets tickets.<br />
<br />
As it is now with the website it's a lottery anyway.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, was talking to my gf about it last night...she also suggested making ticket non-transferable. I know it would possibly screw a couple people over that can't go and want to recoup the monetary loss, but it would go a long way to eliminating the market for the scum of the earth scalpers selling tickets for $600 on ebay :(</div></div><hr />

<br />
Kinda, but it is super easy to change the name on a ticket at the con itself. There is a name change line. The original buyer has to be there though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Regalbeast</div><div class="date">2018-05-10, 05:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">blizzard does not care bout the tickets prices , they have said many times over they don't make any money on the cons to begin.<br />
<br />
They absolutely make money. They might not make money on the actual day but they attribute pipeline (pre-orders, subs, additional game purchases, etc) to the con. That's why they do it....it's marketing and experience making.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">TickerDS</div><div class="date">2018-05-10, 05:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They absolutely make money.

That's why they do it....it's marketing and experience making.<br />
<br />
They absolutely crush it in regards to merch sales. The line for the store is the longest line in the place and people walk away with boatloads of merch. <br />
<br />
I think there are roughly 30,000 attendees give or take...with I would speculate about 3-4k of those being tickets given away to competitors, media, and VIPS. So lets say conservatively 25,000 people pay 204 dollars (with 4 bucks being the fee from the ticket site).... that means on ticket sales alone they bring in 5 MILLION dollars from the tickets alone. Given that they hire decent music acts and a host of middle tier status, plus all the staffing and fee for the convention center, and pay prize pools I would believe that they break roughly even off ticket sales.<br />
<br />
Now pile on the share they get from the food trucks cleaning house outside, sponsor fund for advertising and booth space, the revenue from the virtual ticket, and all that money they print from the merch sales..... I would be willing to bet Blizz takes home at a minimum of an extra 10 million from those sources alone, and that guess is probably super low... Not to mention the good will and buzz they generate to further the brand.<br />
<br />
To a certain extent, that is nothing...chump change... to blizzard...but the event for sure pays for itself.<br />
<br />
That said, those above reasons are why blizz, relative to the cost, does not charge more money than they do. They want people to flood the event and make it a thing.</div></div><hr />
