<meta name="description" content="Blizzard Registers Project Blackstone Domain 
Fusible noticed that ProjectBlackstone.com was recently purchased by Blizzard Entertainment. It doesn't mean much yet but the choice of domain name could point to a side project for Diablo 3 or even pet battles (They also appear to have purchased WarcraftBattles.com last month). 
 
We're mostly reporting this to have a nice point of discussion for it, but nothing really points to it being a major project (= probably not anything Titan related).

The linked article stated that warcraftbattles was owned by an individual from Mass. from 2007-2009, and speculate Blizzard just bought it as a defense tactic of their IP name.<br />

Project Blackstone could literally be anything at this point.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But its a weird domain to begin with like, project blackstone will not be the name of d3 expansion, it just wouldnt make sense, maybe it would be something related to Diablo or at least the story, but as for an expansion name its pretty terrible..</div></div><hr />

<br />
What can be a black stone in the history of Blizzard .. Starcraft Ghost. Reason why they had to postpone ( yep it never was cancelled), they wanted to get it on console and they weren't powerful enough compared to Computers.<br />
<br />
Might be plenty of other things such as D3 expansion or even a new project who knows ... ? Doesn't seem the be Project Titan though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Did cata, mop and all other had their own domain? If not, probably not it, highly doubt it anyway. Also 'Black Stone' does not really seem fitting for a expansion name or theme. But who knows...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ormoro</div><div class="date">2012-11-30, 10:23 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is:<br />
Nothing WoW/D3/SC or Titan related.<br />
This will be a new game on portable devices.<br />
<br />
To guess more(aka what i'm hoping for)<br />
The name of the game where we can bring our ingame WoW pets on our mobile device and battle with our pets without being logged into WoW onto the pc.<br />
Mobile pet battles with real time updates to the game.</div></div><hr />

Also, I doubt we'll be going to down Sargeras any time soon, I'd imagine that would be the very last expansion that blizz would do and for some reason I feel as though they would have one expansion to pave the way to him. I could be wrong though, we went from alien invasion (TBC), to Zombie invasion (wrath), to the end of the world (cata), to war between factions (MoP so far), aside from the whole apocolypse theme they got going on, none of these have anything to do with each other, so maybe they'll do it next expac who knows. lol</div></div><hr />

You won't register a domain name for a product or team's codename. If you do so, its the final name.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Orisai is right, Blizzard would NEVER register the name of an internal project, if they registered &quot;Project Blackstone&quot;, it's mean that whatever will go out will be called &quot;Project Blackstone&quot;. It's like saying DIII is called in fact &quot;Project Hydra&quot; ...<br />
<br />
So my money on either some community related thingy, or new name of Project Titan. I would like to remind you that the Titans are arleady taken as something within a Blizz franchise, and they said that &quot;Project Titan&quot; would be a whole new franchise, so it make sense they changed the name.<br />
<br />
Plus, the fact that chaud said &quot;it's not Titan related&quot; make me think it's Titan related :)</div></div><hr />

I really doubt it's Titan related. And by Titan I mean the new universe not the actual beings called Titans in the Warcraft universe. I just...feel if Titan was going to make itself known it would be Blizzcon. I'll be happy either way of course.</div></div><hr />

They have the battle.net site with all the games there so if it's an expansion it wouldn't need its own site and if it was something PC related (like &quot;Titan&quot;) then it would be implemented into the Battle.net site like WoW, SC2 and D3... <br />
So my guess is that like someone said it's something that has to do with mobile devices... Or something totally different than the usual Blizzard stuff... We'll see...</div></div><hr />

The &quot;Project&quot; part of it doesn't mean anything special. Most games start under &quot;Project (insert codename here)&quot;.

If they want to up the hype, announcing it a few months before and then providing more information at Blizzcon would probably be the way to go. Assuming hype is what they're after; they might not be.</div></div><hr />

Unless the Old Gods turn out to be more powerful than Sargeras.<br />

After all Sargeras turned on the Titans because he thought that the chaos that existed before the Titans interfered is the universe's true nature and should remain so.<br />

They don't make websites for WoW expansion so it can't be it.<br />
Same with SC2, Diablo III expansion hasn't even been thought of until now except that it will come one day, so there's no theme/name.<br />

<br />
This is actually an accurate assessment. The game will feature multiple jurists such as Montesquieu and Hobbs. In the game, you will play an upcoming lawyer who just finished lawschool. In the beginning of the game you'll the option to chose between the Common or Civil law system, which will define two different factions. Skills will include: lawyering, lobbying, lying and the use of IRAC. <br />

With the Law by your side you will sue evil. Justice is all. <br />

It's not likely anything. It's just a name. They could add any name for that matter. No one knows anything because Blizzard chooses their names very randomly when it comes to these things. <br />

Create a sensation out of nothing for next Blizzcon<br />
Heath of the Swarm is unable to do that alone, so Blizz mystifies project they are working on.<br />
Speculation: They also might neet to get some kind of &quot;cloud&quot; site where developers can save their work on project called &quot;Blackstone&quot;.

<br />
This doesn't even make sense. Skipped English class a lot?<br />
<br />
<br />
Just because Titan is the project name, doesn't mean that the game will be called Titan.<br />
<br />
Exactly. In fact, it most certainly WON'T be. <br />
<br />
<br />
Project Titan is just the project's codename. At the time development started, their other projects were named Project Cerberus (Cataclysm), Project Hydra (Diablo III), and Project Medusa (Starcraft II).<br />
<br />
The code names tend to be fairly meaningful, though. Hydra is a three headed beast (Diablo THREE) and Medusa was a reference to Kerrigan. <br />
<br />
Blackstone sounds very Diablo-ish, but &quot;Project Blackstone&quot; certainly doesn't.<br />
<br />
Yes.<br />
<br />
Best bet would be to look up &quot;Blackstone&quot; on the net and see if there is any reference that strikes a cord; most probably Titan, though.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kalcheus</div><div class="date">2012-12-04, 01:58 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">In thinking about it, I'm wondering if this does have something to do with Diablo/Titan/Whatever but is not actually a game name.<br />
<br />
As others have noted, &quot;Project Whatever&quot; is typically an internal name and rarely used to promote. But what if Project Blackstone is actually an online portal/web-advertisement that leads into a new game/xpac? Like a viral web marketing tool (there's actually a technical name for this but for the love of Khaz I can not remember it) with social networking. So you spend 6 months on Project Blackstone before the release of the game/xpac itself.<br />
<br />
And if we're lucky, it'll be a Dresden Files MMO.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What can be a black stone in the history of Blizzard .. Starcraft Ghost. Reason why they had to postpone ( yep it never was cancelled), they wanted to get it on console and they weren't powerful enough compared to Computers.<br />
<br />
Might be plenty of other things such as D3 expansion or even a new project who knows ... ? Doesn't seem the be Project Titan though.<br />
<br />
One of my old guildies worked for blizzard in a management role (cant remember what PR I think). He said SC Ghost was never up to the quality level they wanted so they shelved it. They havent worked on it for years so I doubt they will be releasing a 10 year out of date second rate shooter.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Idras</div><div class="date">2013-02-06, 07:16 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Hm. Thread going on about this on reddit.com (http://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/17zgcf/blizzards_newest_websiteproject_project_blackstone/)<br />
Pretty much all the people mentioned on the projectblackstone.com website have a Twitter account somehow. This is getting interesting... <br />

<br />
We are sure it now concerns Starcraft Universe and getting more convinced it's Starcraft Ghost.<br />
<br />
What you're saying is true, it was up to a higher the level they wish they had. Hardware of console were too low for the game itself. With the new wave of console generation (PS4 and XBOX 3) coming out, they might finally have the level they were waiting for.<br />

If you still can't grasp what SC2 stands for. It's an abbreviation for Star Craft 2. <br />

When you look into the webpages, icon's, the examples of twitter, you can deduct without fail that it has NOTHING todo with diablo3. The artistic design is SO FAR away from medieval fantasy. It couldn't be more apart.<br />
I don't get it, you simply have to LOOK at the banner and the twitter spoofs to see it has a futuristic/nano like theme. Terminology used is also very futuristic.<br />

More likely than not, it's just some lore/background that will tie into the Heart of the Swarm campaign. It seems like the usual pre-release hype with its social media component and everything.</div></div><hr />

Just to point something else out, it might have nothing to do with &quot;Star Craft 2: Phoenix&quot; since the Logo you refer to as a Phoenix (it could be that it reffered to it) is the Logo of the Terran race in Starcraft.</div></div><hr />
