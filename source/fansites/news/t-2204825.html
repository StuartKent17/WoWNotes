<br />
Doubt that. They said previously they were looking at a way for Demon Hunters to use them for transmog because they're iconic and there aren't warglaives out there.<br />
<br />
I really hope that you don't need the achievement for warglaives on the demon hunter though. I've got it on another character, and if this is limited time (there has been suggestion it's for the anniversary similar to molten core). You may just not have had enough kills to get them (it took me 4 years killing Geddon every week to get the 2nd binding I needed) so RNG can really screw you over.</div></div><hr />

The item to unlock them as a transmog is DH only. But it looks like the item ITSELF can also still drop like in regular BT (though probably wont unlock the appearance, same as now).</div></div><hr />

I also hope the achievement can be earned account wide by more than one character. It's ridiculously difficult to get both glaives on a single character. If it works if one character has a main hand, and another has the off hand, then I'm in favor.</div></div><hr />

And when doing the PvP world quests that I'm only doing because I really want the wolf mount is super difficult because most other players have a higher ilvl than me and kick my ass in about two hits. My guardian druid that just recently hit 110 can't even survive invasion WQs because her ilvl isn't high enough to deal with mobs that are averaged (I assume) for people who are 110 and have been for a while, and have presumably done some mythics and raids because questlines demanded it. I want to tame Fenryr on my hunter, but that's going to be super hard without getting into some normal or even heroic level raids for some better gear. I don't raid if I can help it. I don't enjoy mythics at all. I'm sick of this xpac forcing me to do things I don't enjoy and am not good at, just to advance the story or unlock something crucial.<br />
<br />
I'm sick of this xpac in general, but I know I'm in the minority there. About all I'm looking forward to is finally getting flying so I'm not at a huge disadvantage, so I can do WQs more easily, and especially so I can stop feeling like I HAVE to be playing my main and working on rep because otherwise I'm wasting my time in the game.</div></div><hr />

And those holy changes make no sense. 1. CoH is never used and probably wont be even with this buff, secondly, why would you need to nerf divinity (AGAIN) to compensate. CoH has literally no interaction with divinity other than benefitting from the % increase like all other heals. CoH casts means less holy words, so what's the point in nerfing divinity? <br />

<br />
Affliction main here since the beginning of BC. Been my only main for over a decade. <br />
<br />
I am 100% in favor of the MG nerf. <br />
<br />
MG needed to be brought down. <br />
<br />
That talent alone made us feel way too much like a shadow priest. Affliction has never been about draining like a shadow priest until the last couple of expansions... and even in WoD we had to maintain our dots on multiple targets... the drain was just the filler. <br />
<br />
Now its even worse this expansion; and specifically in 7.2; where in order to keep up with the group in DPS, you essentially have to drop the &quot;muti-target, dot maintenance&quot; play style that we have had been used to for years until WoD. <br />
<br />
The up time that you need for MG is now overshadowing the core play style of dot management that affliction has always been known for. Now, if im not sitting in one spot and turreting the boss with MG and a 3 or 4 stack of UA; my output is shit. <br />
<br />
Maybe now, we can get back to feeling like Affliction warlocks and not shadow priests. <br />
<br />
A lot of Afflocks are crying over this nerf; but I welcome it. I wish it could go live today.</div></div><hr />

While I agree with this, not giving us anything to compensate for the damage lost is not a trade I'd want</div></div><hr />

Not that I mind, but that means every tom dick and harry will get a set on their DH, I really, really hope they do the same with the rest of the legenderies even if we have to wait a while. I main a DH, but this totally isn't fair on the rest of the community who can equip the glaives / other legends,</div></div><hr />
