Drysc posted about the upcoming changes in Alterac Valley.<br />
<br />
There are quite a few changes coming, all of which we hope will culminate into making players want to participate, and ultimately win the battleground.<br />
<br />
Obviously as most people know we have the anti-afk reporting measure, by which you can right click on someone in the battleground and mark them as AFK. With enough reports they receive a debuff that keeps them from earning honor in that battleground, and only by entering combat can they remove that debuff. It's going to help, but it's certainly not enough on its own.<br />
<br />
Other things we're doing are changing or pulling out NPCs in key locations to help even out the balance of time and effort each side has to take to push through. As well as some minor changes to locations that people find are easily exploited to advance faster.<br />
<br />
We're shifting some of the honor from the earlier NPCs, that help make AFKing so lucrative, to the end of the battleground and more for actually winning.<br />
<br />
The graveyard spawning is being changed so that players aren't sent back to the cave unless there is nowhere else to spawn, which should help encourage horde to play a bit more defense if they're being beaten back.<br />
<br />
And we're also correcting the ... I think Jeff referred to them as &quot;creative pulling mechanics&quot; with the general's.<br />
<br />
Everything together, we feel, should help encourage players to participate, while also improving overall balance.<br />

Low-population realms<br />
Blizzard is stuck with a few empty realms. They're searching for new way to fill them, and it seems that they're considering realm merging.<br />
<br />
We're certainly looking at additional means to help realms that have lower populations.<br />
<br />
There are a couple issues with merging realms though that we would need to take into heavy consideration if one were to be considered. As many of the lower population realms are PvP, faction balance has to be taken into careful consideration. Would a merge worsen, improve, or leave any faction balance unchanged? Would a merge move the population up too high, queuing or leading to queues for the realm after that point? Do we have realms of the same time zone and type that would merge well under these conditions? There also many logistical issues with merges which ultimately effect the end user, such as conflicting character and guild names. So, in the end, a merge would only be considered if all other possible options have been completely exhausted.<br />
<br />
We're not just throwing recommended tags up on realms, and calling it a day. The recommended tag has done a lot of good for a lot of realms, but if we're seeing that they're no longer helping reach the type of population numbers we would like to see, then we would investigate alternate means. That's sort of where we're at now.<br />

Yes, they're here, you can stop posting on other forums. For the moment the posts are still advertised in the &quot;Latest posts&quot; frame at the top of the homepage, but there are really too many of them i'll probably deactivate it.<br />

I played on the test realm the other night and fought for like 3 hours, back and forth, summoning the Ice Lord, war riders, etc. It was fun, like the old days. I got on live and we didn't even kill Galv, it was just a mad rush to Drek. Boring. I wish they'd make it worth it to clear out bosses/graveyards/towers. Give more honor for doing it, something to make it worth the time to fight the longer fights.</div></div><hr />

But the way it is right now you still get the same amount wether you rush it or go the long way. Not accounting for the indiviual killings you get which get less and less the more often we keep killing the same ones over and over. That right there would make someone just want to get it over with seeing how there's no gain.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree completely.<br />
<br />
I actually liked to do the AV-premades where the match would be over in a maximum of 20 minutes. No Horde defense and a straight rush on both sides (hell a lot of people would just pass each other on the way to the next place). It was more of a skillful race than it was a contest of attrition.</div></div><hr />

Make it so that AV Marks are gained by taking/defending objectives and return the game back to how it originally was! The 6 hour ordeals that made AV epic and fun.. not this piece of junk that whiners got it turned into..<br />
<br />
Now its literally just a race track..</div></div><hr />

Look before server transfers they would merge servers and they didnt seem to have a problem with that so whats the issue now... so what if people have the same names and guild names? make them change it... im sure some of them will welcome having to change their names cause they're loot whores or ninjas so they wont mind a verry few ppl would complain on having to change their guild name or their toons name to benefit themselfs in the long run being in a higher pop server... Plz dont feed me that crap blizz its not even hard to do</div></div><hr />
