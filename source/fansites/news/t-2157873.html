WoW Token Temporarily Disabled<br />
We've encountered a brief technical issue with the WoW Token system which has resulted in it temporarily being disabled in the Americas, Oceanic, and European regions. We're hard at work to restore functionality and will have it back up and running as soon as possible. <br />
<br />
Thank you for your patience.<br />
<br />
But the ones we have in our inventory will still function properly, yeah? We just can't purchase them?<br />
Yep!<br />
<br />
<br />
Patch 7.2 PTR - Build 23445 Delayed<br />
Brief update: we've encountered an issue with this build which is preventing us from actually pushing it to the PTR. We're still hoping to get it out this week, but it'll be tomorrow at the earliest.<br />

<br />
Essence Font (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/191837)'s periodic effect can now correctly critical heal.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/irogues.gif Rogue (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/275-Rogue) / Skills (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/rogue) / Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Q) / Artifact Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/artifact-calculator#RAAAAAAAA) / PvP Talent Calculator (http://www.wowdb.com/pvp-talent-calculator#Q))<br />
<br />
Shadow Dance (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/185313) should no longer sometimes consume a charge but fail to trigger.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
Mythic Keystone Dungeons<br />
<br />
Players who complete a Mythic Keystone dungeon at level 13, 14, or 15 will receive items of the following item levels from the chest at the end of the dungeon:<br />
<br />
Mythic 13 – 875<br />
Mythic 14 – 880<br />
Mythic 15 – 885<br />
<br />
Items from the weekly Grand Challenger's Bounty will be of the following item levels:<br />
<br />
Mythic 13 – 890<br />
Mythic 14 – 895<br />
Mythic 15 – 900<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Aluriel's Mirror (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140795-aluriels-mirror): Healing-over-time effectiveness increased by 140%. Area of effect healing detonation effectiveness reduced by 35%.<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Aluriel’s Mirror’s detonation effect is strong when it activates, but hard to rely on. We’re increasing the heal-over-time effect significantly to improve the up-front value of this trinket, and reducing the detonation effect slightly to compensate.<br />
<br />
Animated Exoskeleton (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140789-animated-exoskeleton): Absorb amount increased by 33%.<br />
Arcanogolem Digit (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140794-arcanogolem-digit): Damage increased by 30%.<br />
Claw of the Crystalline Scorpid (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140790-claw-of-the-crystalline-scorpid): Damage increased by 30%.<br />
Convergence of Fates (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140806-convergence-of-fates):<br />
<br />
(Frost Death Knight) Proc rate increased by 10% with Empower Rune Weapon, decreased by 23% with Hungering Rune Weapon.<br />
(Unholy Death Knight) Proc rate increased by 68% with Summon Gargoyle, and no change with Dark Arbiter.<br />
(Feral Druid) Fixed a bug that prevented Incarnation from working properly with Convergence, and no change with Berserk.<br />
(Windwalker Monk) Proc rate decreased by 62% with Storm, Earth, and Fire, and decreased by 75% with Serenity.<br />
(Retribution Paladin) Proc rate increased by 250% with Avenging Wrath, and increased by 25% with Crusade.<br />
<br />
Draught of Souls (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140808-draught-of-souls): The Use effect of this trinket now respects the global cooldown. The damage of this trinket is now reduced by 30% for Unholy Death Knights (was reduced by 40%).<br />
<br />
Developers’ Notes: Since Draught of Souls deals Shadow Damage, it’s increased by Unholy’s Mastery, which means we needed to reduce its base damage to keep its overall value similar to other classes. It’s currently a little too low, however, so we’re increasing the damage it deals for Unholy.<br />
<br />
Entwined Elemental Foci (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140796-entwined-elemental-foci): The amount of Critical Strike, Mastery, and Haste granted by this item has been increased by 5%.<br />
Etraeus' Celestial Map (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140803-etraeus-celestial-map): The amount of Critical Strike, Mastery, and Haste granted by this item has been increased by 5%.<br />
Fury of the Burning Sky (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140801-fury-of-the-burning-sky): Damage increased by 40%.<br />
Icon of Rot (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140798-icon-of-rot): Damage increased by 40%.<br />
Might of Krosus (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140799-might-of-krosus): Damage reduced by 25%, but is now always a critical strike. Also, fixed a bug where the cooldown was incorrectly being reduced if Might of Krosus damaged at least 3 targets. The tooltip for Might of Krosus will display the amount of damage that will result from the critical hit, not the base damage.<br />
Perfectly Preserved Cake (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140793-perfectly-preserved-cake): Absorb amount increased by 140%.<br />
Pharamere's Forbidden Grimoire (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140800-pharameres-forbidden-grimoire): Damage increased by 85%.<br />
Star Gate (http://www.wowdb.com/items/140804-star-gate): Damage increased by 30%.<br />

Since 7.1.5 there are 1,380 parses for Survival in heroic Nighthold (that's by far the least amount of parses.. followed by 4,479 Sub rogues and 7,024 Frost mages) compare this number to 54,693 MM and 32,449 BM parses and you'll understand why Arvandor thinks, BM is not in any way significant for the current meta in Legion. And yes, I'm only speaking about raiding since I have no idea about PvP.<br />
<br />
Edit.<br />
If you look at normal Nighthold the ratio is almost equally bad. 5,921 Survival parses vs 132,025 MM and 101,726 BM. Together with Sub rogues 9,846 parses it's the only DPS spec with &lt;26,335 parses. (Frost mages playing 3rd place again)</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's not about balancing difficulty per se, it's about M+ offering an alternative to gear that doesn't make raiding pointless. So no, M+ won't ever be as good as a large raid. At least for now.</div></div><hr />

We weren't just nerfed, we were destroyed. We relied on dmg to do anything worthwhile since we'd immediately crumple and die in a paralyzed heap the moment a melee looked in our direction. we had to dish out as much as we could before we got noticed. Now we can't even do that with any build, so there IS no ele meta anymore pvp side. rip, again.</div></div><hr />
