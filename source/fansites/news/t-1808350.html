<br />
<br />
Itemization Quality/Chance Hotfixes Coming Soon<br />
We’re preparing a hotfix to be deployed during next week’s downtime, which will make a few changes in time for the new raid week.<br />
<br />
This hotfix will:<br />
Triple the chance that a Mythic dungeon item can upgrade to Warforged. As a reminder, when a Mythic dungeon item is Warforged (which can drop from any Mythic dungeon boss), the item level is increased from 685 to 705. Increase the number of set pieces that drop from set bosses in Normal and Heroic Hellfire Citadel. This will affect both personal loot and group loot. Increase the chance of getting an item when using a Seal of Tempered Fate.<br />
<br />
We’ll be pushing a separate hotfix live today that will double the chance that a Timewarped item drops as Warforged, which increases its ilvl at level 100 from 660 to 675.<br />
<br />
Also Tempered fate not inevitable?<br />
Correct. It's a catch up change.<br />
<br />
The doubled chance for Warforged Timewarped items is now live.<br />
<br />
<br />
Timewalker Dungeon Feedback<br />
-Fix Righteous Fury so it doesn't unapply by entering and exiting a dungeon.<br />
Most buffs are cleared when entering Timewalking, similar to Arena. This is necessary to ensure that the down-scaling that occurs when you enter the dungeon is done cleanly.<br />
<br />
-Fix the Dungeon Finder's &quot;Find new players&quot; option so people arent absolutely boned by leavers<br />
This is a bug we're actively working to address. The Dungeon Finder should be trying to refill groups for you.<br />
<br />
-Is there any way to make Barrage stupid proof? please? Like, replace it with how volley used to be cast instead of every damned thing in front of the hunter.<br />
Ideally people understand how their AoEs work before using them freely. We're always keeping an eye on things though.<br />
<br />
-Add a bag that you can get for completing your first random timewalker for the day that drops a 660 piece and a chance at some pets and maybe a mount. Give the players a 'choo-choo train&quot; so its a little easier to digest this... thing.<br />
We're at least doubling the chance that a Timewarped item will drop as Warforged. That should feel a little better?<br />
<br />
The feedback is appreciated and we're always happy to clarify how things function, whether intended or not, whenever we can. It'd be cool, though, to sometimes not read that feedback with such incendiary statements as &quot;the failure that it is&quot; or &quot;make it stupid proof.&quot;<br />
<br />
From my perspective it just makes filtering through feedback more cumbersome. There's more stuff to sift through in general, and then I have to try and weight the hyperbole against the legitimacy of the feedback.<br />
<br />
You're passionate about the game and you're coming here to let us know about some things that frustrated you with a new system. I get it. That's cool. I just wish it could stay as simple as that, with less emphasis on the dramatic.<br />
<br />
In any event, the thread is about Timewalking, and there are some improvements and fixes in order. Hopefully they help.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Character / Items<br />
Do you still do toys? The Contender's Costumes can't be removed manually - you have to wait out the debuff time.<br />
If you could remove it manually, as soon as you were losing, you'd right-click it off, unfair to the other players. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/612496766001254401))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Sha of Anger isn't the same as pre-fly pvp. People didn't fight in TM and SS because they'd get honor points or loot.<br />
.Do you think TM vs. SS world pvp (pre-honor) can ever return to WoW? Why or why not? (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/612497210706542592))<br />

It is suprising that only one guild has killed Archimonde yet. This one might be more difficult, perhaps similar to Ragnaros (Normal) Firelands pre-nerf.</div></div><hr />

God forbid a walking (no mobility) spec hitting you for something decent while everyone else dishes out insane dmg from everyone in the map...<br />
<br />
They were decent in pvp already and the abilities were doing 20% dmg less on players, so no change on pvp basically, people were just butthurt that frost dks and mages got some necessary buffs for pve to not be bottom dmg by far anymore while they didn't (because they didn't need such big buffs).<br />
<br />
No changes for PvP, that means you're gonna still think they're way too strong in PvP, while they're poor in PvE.<br />
<br />
While Enhanc Shamans didn't need a whole 20%+ on everything without any nerf on pvp/pve and you think it's ok. Good thing is that they're probably the next one to be picked by people to cry for nerf and get reverted.</div></div><hr />

You're joking right? Please tell me you're joking. Because I can't stop laughing. If this was a troll post, then it was funny as hell. Fdks are underpowered?!? They dominated the crap out of unholy in arena play because of how bursty they were. You know how many times I got asked to switch specs for better pressure? I'm glad they reverted the changes.<br />

I realize that their buffs were probably intended for pve, it would have been awful on the pvp side</div></div><hr />

Blah blah blah...we're talking about the best guilds of the world with tight schedules, sometimes 7 days a week raiding, PTR coverage before that, crafting their eq like the old days and going in fully mythic warfored.<br />
Also: MYTHIC is what they're aiming to be clearing and that WILL take weeks. Mythic is the equivalent of the &quot;old days&quot;.<br />

And from the looks this time around, it seems that Blizz is only going to have Mythic: Archimonde Guild Run under the Draenor Raid Achievements on the Guild Armory pages.. Unlike before when you had Highmaul Guild Run and Blackrock Foundry Guild Run there is no Hellfire Citadel Guild Run Achievement for this tier which is interesting..</div></div><hr />

if the both items are random no point of playing tank/heal in random heroic anymore, only if you have at least 4 alts lvl 100... can't be used unde lvl 100 and i get only 0.01 gold for selling.

Such crap. Warlocks and mages can over-produce for entire expansions but don't let a plate wearer get close to the top. They should have given it two to three weeks to see what happened as other classes got gear...what a joke this development group is.</div></div><hr />

So get your alts into tanaan then so they can get their own! The point of it is to get people actually playing their alts instead of just having them sit there doing nothing and having things funnelled to them. And if you don't want to play your alts, then why do they need the gear in the first place?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Paragon, Method, Blood Legion, Exodus, Midwinter etc. etc.<br />
<br />
All the top guilds are raiding fairly casual hours on HC week, and doing 5x Split raids. Nobody cares about killing HC bosses world first.</div></div><hr />

Unlike before when you had Highmaul Guild Run and Blackrock Foundry Guild Run there is no Hellfire Citadel Guild Run Achievement for this tier which is interesting..<br />
<br />
True, though that wasn't my point to my reply concerning &quot;the old (HARD) raiding days&quot; :) <br />
Your argument is &quot;not enough content&quot; &gt; absolutely true.</div></div><hr />

Also: MYTHIC is what they're aiming to be clearing and that WILL take weeks. Mythic is the equivalent of the &quot;old days&quot;.<br />
<br />
Now please, here's the box for pink shades.<br />
<br />
And therein is the biggest problem with WOW. Balancing around PVP hurts both sides. PVP skills and damage should be entirely separate and separate balance.</div></div><hr />
