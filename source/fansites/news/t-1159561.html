New Recruit a Friend Mount: Obsidian Nightwing<br />
Blizzard sent out an email today reminding people that have and unclaimed X-53 Touring Rocket (http://www.wowdb.com/items/54860) from the current Recruit a Friend program to claim them before July 17th. After that date the new mount, Heart of the Nightwing (http://www.wowdb.com/items/83086), will be the reward for recruiting other players. This mount allows you to carry one other player on your back.<br />
<br />
If you have a Rocket pending and would like this new mount, you need to leave the Rocket unclaimed (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/6080898793?page=2#26) to get the new mount when it is released.<br />

Terrace of Endless Spring<br />
Straddling the mountain range between the Jade Forest and the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, the Terrace of Endless Spring has been a sacred refuge for millennia. Its peaceful fountains are said to have the power to heal and rejuvenate, but when the Sha of Fear attacked, many of the complex's guardians turned on each other in fits of terror.<br />

Beta Class Balance Analysis<br />
Agree 100%, I think GC is too stuck on balancing for PvE right now, not really looking into how survival feels in PvP, rather just saying &quot;dots are powerful in PvP&quot;, not really, especially when the enemy has heals. And survival has no burst even with the current LnL. Not to mention dispell protection, but dispells are on a 6 second cd now..<br />
We are stuck on numbers for purposes of this thread, and numbers just don't relate directly to success in PvP as much as they do for PvE. It's easier (but not trivial) to demonstrate that (for sake of argument) Survival's damage is lower than Marks. It's much harder to argue that Survival has PvP challenges because of that theoretical disparity. If you have PvP concerns, those are totally appropriate things to relay somewhere in this forum. Not having enough CC or group utility or whatever aren't really related to understanding theorycrafting and rotational analysis, which is the purpose of this thread.<br />
<br />
Awesome. Basically it was the tooltip applying the diminishing returns on Agility and not on Dodge that was throwing everything off. With that, we should have better evaluations from the Guardian community.<br />
Yeah, we will try to add dodge from Agi to the Agi and dodge tooltips. Currently they’re just included in the title of each of those tooltips, which are final values after summing all of the sources and applying DR. The “(before diminishing returns)” line in the dodge tooltip, refers just to the “dodge of X adds Y% dodge” line, not the total. It’s somewhat confusing right now. All of this goes for Strength / parry as well.<br />

Question regarding Soul Reaper: assuming it costs Runic Power<br />
We have no idea if it will cost Runic Power yet. Runic Power works okay for Unholy, but it creates a really bad rotation for Frost in execute range as you try to juggle Frost Strikes (which is why we didn't go that route to begin with). We need some time to try some things out before we're happy enough with Soul Reaper to turn you guys loose on it again.<br />
<br />
It's not about the QQ. Yeah, other tanks get it free. So what? Classes are different. What we need to focus on is the consequences of this change. To put it briefly, Blood DKs will ignore diseases beyond using the free outbreak to maintain 50% uptime.<br />
This is great feedback because it focuses on the consequences of things, not complaints or lobbying for buffs. While this thread aims to be all about theorycraft, there is still a place for useful feedback that doesn’t include numbers, and this post is a great example of that. <br />
<br />
We recognize that DKs (and to a much much lesser extent warriors) currently need to sacrifice their tanking performance in order to put up Weakened Blows, and are looking at some possible solutions to that issue. We’re currently trying out a change where the Scarlet Fever passive for Blood DKs also makes Blood Boil refresh your diseases on targets it hits, but are exploring other options as well. With warriors it's trickier, but one option is to have Thunder Clap generate a tiny bit of rage. It might be fine for warriors as is though.<br />

I don't know if it's something new to level 86+ players but to me it seems like there is a new, unforeseen formula when calculating the Agility to Dodge variable. On my level 85 Worgen Druid on the beta, I can easily get the 243.58281085 Agility to Dodge conversion working. It does appear that Base Agility is now being affected by the Agility to Dodge (whereas on live it is not).<br />
All Agility (base and bonus) grants dodge at a rate of 951.158596 to 1% at level 90. However, dodge from bonus Agility and dodge rating is affected by diminishing returns. “Bonus” Agility refers to all Agility beyond what you have with no gear/buffs (for example, a level 90 troll Druid has 97 base Agility and all other Agility is Bonus).<br />
<br />

Explosive Shot is scaling exactly as the coefficient described. The problem is that, its scaling modifiers were admitted to by Ghostcrawler himself to be very much flawed but it was never addressed in the actual game design.<br />
At the time we thought it was a problem. I'm not sure it's going to be a problem in Mists, but feel free to try and prove us wrong. Do you think that ranged weapon damage is going to grow faster in subsequent tiers than RAP is (keeping in mind that ranged weapons are now balanced like two-handed weapons)? <br />
<br />
Part of our testing is to look at theoretical damage in subsequent and even final tiers. As I said before, we don't know yet what set bonuses and trinkets will look like, and it's possible we will tweak the design or numbers of a few abilities by then, but we do have a pretty good guess of how things will fall out. (To be fair, we used to suck at scaling. In vanilla there were some abilities that did a percent of attack power and some that just did flat numbers and that was that. We have gotten a lot better at keeping everything scaling with gear at about the same rate, particularly in the last two expansions.)<br />
<br />
Can we have some on demand burst with survival's LnL talent? for example, while LnL is active, all explosive shot damage is increased by a certain amount, or has a 100% chance to crit? Otherwise, even with LnL Tripple explosive shot, it barely manages to reach the damage of a regular chimera shot...<br />
What numbers are we talking about? Trying this out right now, in 463 gear, with no outside buffs, a non-crit Chimera Shot does 40 K damage. Three Explosive Shots do a total of 80 K damage, non-crit. (It's possible our numbers are different from beta at this point.)<br />
<br />

Also, CS seems to hit like a wet noodle currently in beta vis a vis HotR <br />
Are you using a white weapon for those numbers or something like that? We show Crusader Strike hitting for about 10K and HotR for 6K in gear similar to yours.<br />
<br />

I would IMAGINE it would be additional ticks/akin to Efflor, but am just looking for clarity. (I ask also, so we can start calculating how Haste will affect HW: Sanc from a breakpoint perspective...) <br />
Sanctuary should scale with haste like Efflorescence. It just adds more ticks.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/276-Shaman))<br />
Glyph of Riptide. Points about the lack of AA and Resurgence procs aside (because they were addressed earlier), what concerns me most about this glyph is the usage that it's seeing by shaman in the Beta, who are recording parses where RT is their primary or secondary heal because of its Rejuv-spam-like application. This practice essentially devalues Tidal Waves management and spell weaving in favor of RT blanketing.<br />
We like the Glyph of Riptide quite a bit because it really opens up a different healing style. You can act like a druid and blanket the group with hots, which might sometimes be really effective or at the very least give you a different style of healing to try. If it looks like every shaman is going to take the glyph, we'll nerf it, but as you point out, it has downsides (like Tidal Waves).<br />
<br />
Glyph of Chaining is incredibly weak, such that Shaman would be better off electing to handle AOE raid damage on a spread raid as we have since Ulduar--through single-target healing.<br />
The glyph is getting a lot of use for dungeons and 10-player raiding. It's not going to be as attractive across the board in 25-player raiding because there are usually some groups around in which you can use an unglyphed Chain Heal. The melee are often grouped for at least part of any fight, and in a 25, there are usually plenty of melee.<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarlocks.gif Warlock (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/277-Warlock))<br />
If that's the case, can we look into removing Ember decay?<br />
Embers don’t decay until you’ve been out of combat for 30 sec, and decay at a rate of one every 25 sec. So if you’re spending a full minute between pulls, you’ll lose 1 ember. It shouldn’t feel particularly punitive. You may be remembering how it felt several builds ago, where they started decaying immediately and decayed one every 10 sec.<br />
<br />
We aren't trying to be punitive here. What we want to avoid is the warlock feeling like the right way to play is to go build up full embers before any boss encounter or other serious fight. That stops feeling like breaking the rules in a fun way and starts to feel like a chore. &quot;Let me eat food, drink a flask and go find something to build up my embers.&quot;<br />

The Language Barrier in LFD and LFR<br />
I'm absolutely astounded at the fact that Blizzard has put Latin realms into US Battlegroups. I am not a racist person by any means, but I do find it extremely frustrating that when I que up for a random dungeon, 9 times out of 10, my group is composed of 3/5 people who cannot speak English. I do believe that the Latin realms should be divided into their own battlegroup, considering how there is definitely enough of them. It creates quite the language barrier and creates many problems when you get a group of 5 people, and half of them don't understand the other half.<br />
While we understand some of the sentiment about this, it's important to understand that by separating pools of players, we impact queue times. Overall, the language of the game itself can bridge the gap in most cases. There's not much else I can say about this other than I'm going to close this thread since these can often devolve into inappropriate discussion.

Arena Pass 2012 Rewards - Mount/Title Sent Out?<br />
Both the title and the pet have already been awarded to those who were eligible. If you believe that you should have received either one of these rewards but it was not given to you, please contact our customer support team as they should be able to assist with determining your eligibility.<br />
<br />
Do note though the characters that you use to qualify for both the pet and the title must play all of their qualifying games on the same team and must also remain in that team for the duration of Arena Pass. If you leave your team at any time it may void your eligibility by resetting the number of games that need to be played. This means that if you have left your team after you played the games to receive your pet then you might not receive it because of that. <br />
<br />
We are currently investigating this matter where players are eligible for the pet but have not yet received it. We will get back to you on this as soon as we have an update. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/229430-arena-pass-2012-rewards-mount-title-been-given-yet/) / Official Forums (http://eu.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/4937073720?page=1#17))<br />
<br />
Content Difficulty and Consumption Speed<br />
Sometimes players shouldn't be able to get the BiS gear and they shouldn't complain about it, since only a few people with decent/high skill should be able to.<br />
Why? I mean, why with objective reasons. Not because some people need to be able to brag about the awesome gear they have that noone else can but dream of acquiring. <br />
<br />
I like the example someone gave and you decided to ignore. 'We don't ask rooney, messi,... to play worse, so mike from next door can come play in the WC football'.<br />
I ignored it because it's twisting my example just to try to make it sound unfair. Read my wording on that post. Would you enjoy being told that you can't play football because you can't perform at the level those football players do? Probably not.<br />
<br />
The comparison to your example in WoW terms would be asking Paragon to play worse so that Mike can join their guild, which is not what I suggested. Not. even. close.<br />
<br />
It should be worthwhile to do the whole content of an expansion and not only the latest tier.<br />
Well, it is worthwhile. If someone hasn't experienced Sinestra yet, I encourage them to do so. It's a fun encounter. Same applies for Heroic Ragnaros and his Heroic only phase.<br />
<br />
No one will want to improve if they can just wait for nerfs, Jito.<br />
Why wouldn't they want to improve? I'm actually yet to see a player in the forums saying something like &quot;waiting for the 20% nerf before raiding!&quot; (that it's not trolling, either).<br />
<br />
It's one of those arguments that I've never understood. Apparently, other than you (those saying this), noone wants to improve. When in reality, what's happening, is that in most cases people have different learning curves. Some will learn and improve very quickly, and others will need much longer before reaching that same level.

Arena Spectating<br />
As has been mentioned a few times in this topic, spectator mode for arenas and battlegrounds would be cool and it is definitely something we would like to do. At this point however, we have no plans to implement such a feature.<br />

Just how long are they planning on waiting?<br />

I'm absolutely astounded at the fact that Blizzard has put Latin realms into US Battlegroups. I am not a racist person by any means, but I do find it extremely frustrating that when I que up for a random dungeon, 9 times out of 10, my group is composed of 3/5 people who cannot speak English. I do believe that the Latin realms should be divided into their own battlegroup, considering how there is definitely enough of them. It creates quite the language barrier and creates many problems when you get a group of 5 people, and half of them don't understand the other half.<br />
<br />
While we understand some of the sentiment about this, it's important to understand that by separating pools of players, we impact queue times. Overall, the language of the game itself can bridge the gap in most cases. There's not much else I can say about this other than I'm going to close this thread since these can often devolve into inappropriate discussion.<br />
<br />
Ok, first let me state that I rarely run into a group where anyone doesn't speak english, but that might just be my battlegroup. <br />
<br />
I am definitely a pessimist, but the response read to me as, &quot;Don't worry we won't make anything actually require coordination.&quot; This means there will be no pulls with multiple CC even recommended else it would be hard to tell someone whom they should cc. It also means that there won't be any encounters that the strategy for isn't spelled out in complete detail inside the dungeon journal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hell, I'd be getting that mount so my Druid could look like a conglomeration of itself :D<br />
<br />
<br />
Being honest, that mount is ugly. Its just a different version of the JC mounts, at least the rocket was unique.<br />
<br />
Um, there are 2/3 other rocket mounts in the game, the Big Love Rocket and the X-51/X-51 Extreme. If you go from the &quot;Touring Rocket is a different shape than the others&quot;, then the Nightwing is only similar to the final JC mount, as the four required ones are ground mounts. In addition, if I'm reading this right, you can get this prior to Mists (a week from now?), and also without the sheer gold sink the JC mounts are looking to be.</div></div><hr />

Use a gamecard and credit is given upon attaching. The only reason it takes time otherwise is with a credit card you don't get billed until the previous time expires where as game time cards are automatically applied.</div></div><hr />

&quot; I received a reply to my inquiry a bit faster than I expected. Yes, this is how it is intended to work this time around. So, if you qualify for the mount through the Recruit a Friend promotion you have until the 17th to redeem the X-53. If you do not, you'll have the option to get the new mount, once it is released. &quot;<br />
<br />
The bold part is the answer you're looking for.</div></div><hr />

Yes but with a gamecard, you pay for two months instead of just one (in addition to the month that comes with the base game)</div></div><hr />

Feels good to see a Blizzard representative continue to bring common sense to this discussion, because I have yet to see anyone actually answer this question with anything other than tired comparisons to real life. A video game is not real life: For a lot of people (and I would even be confident enough to say &quot;most people&quot;), video games are either a hobby or an escape. They are not -supposed- to be an extension of real life, bound to its rules and principles.<br />
<br />
Competition and challenge is one thing, but at the end of the day, no matter how it makes you feel, what someone else halfway across the country does in a videogame does not (and should not) make any difference to what you, yourself, have done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Although, I honestly don't like the wings on it (in the manner of they look too different in texture from the actual mount). It honestly appears like (and they probably did) the wings were simply pulled off the Winged Guardian and stuck onto the mount with a recolour. Except for that... the mount looks great :).</div></div><hr />

Sure it looks good in terms of profits and investors, but the reason I and most of my guild quit wow was because of the low pop neglected realm which has been in need of a server merge for the last year and a half now.<br />

<br />
I'm absolutely astounded at the fact that Blizzard has put Latin realms into US Battlegroups. I am not a racist person by any means, but I do find it extremely frustrating that when I que up for a random dungeon, 9 times out of 10, my group is composed of 3/5 people who cannot speak English. I do believe that the Latin realms should be divided into their own battlegroup, considering how there is definitely enough of them. It creates quite the language barrier and creates many problems when you get a group of 5 people, and half of them don't understand the other half.<br />
<br />
While we understand some of the sentiment about this, it's important to understand that by separating pools of players, we impact queue times. Overall, the language of the game itself can bridge the gap in most cases. There's not much else I can say about this other than I'm going to close this thread since these can often devolve into inappropriate discussion. (Blue Tracker / Official Forums)<br />
<br />
I am highly disappointed that Blizzard is not going to do anything about seperating the latin america servers from the rest of the USA servers. It's bad enough when I'd say 80% of the time i'll do a random LFG end time heroic or even just a normal heroic if im in the mood, only to get a tank, healer, dps, or all three, that supposedly don't speak english and apparantly have no clue on basic class mechanics such as tanking to hold aggro, healing and using your healing skills effectivly or how to dps and focus on what the tank is tanking so you don't pull aggro on something else you aren't supposed to. <br />
<br />
And most of the time you won't even know about the language barrier because they usually won't speak all that much until an addon spams something in spanish or another language and you are thinking &quot;Great...this will be fun... not&quot;. Heck don't get me wrong if it's english speaking players that are doing poorly after several wipes I will try to help out by suggesting they do some reading on sites like Noxxic or Elitist Jerks and learn more about the class they play and how to play better. I'll even try to suggest the same thing regardless of language and hope they understand some basic english but when you get constant wipe after wipe because of the language barrier it's just not worth it to bang your head on the wall for an hour until they learn how to do the most basic things in wow such as not standing in the fire etc.<br />
<br />
&quot;Impact que times&quot; is a sorry excuse for something blizzard should have done a long time ago. I don't recall the language barrier being a problem years ago way before LFG system was even invented, and even when it first came out in Wrath it was pretty rare at first at least in my battlegroup to see someone who didn't speak english. They seperated the eastern part of the world into their own European, Chinese, etcetera servers, but watch.. Blizzard might get the bright idea to merge *ALL* servers into one massive battlegroup.. then watch the language problem escalate a lot more and blizzard with a canned response of &quot;It would impact que times&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Just proving my point really, fan boys like you believe the game is doing fine as it always has because sub numbers are still up so high. The reason they are so high are because of ploys like this+30$ box set/annual pass/free level 80 resulting in people accessing multipul accounts/being counted as a subscriber despite not playing. You think active playing subs are actually at 10 mil players? Blizzards marketing ploys have succeeded. <br />
<br />
Dwindling realms that have terrible population/balance are becomming more and more common, it's one of the largest factors that contribute to players leaving the game. It get's ignored along with many other issues, like the mess pvp is, and the huge gaps between content. Players leave, subs drop, bliz prop them up with a marketing trick. Game is still unhealthy, has numerous servers in decline, fans/investors see the sub numbers as rock solid.<br />
<br />
There is a reason the company is being sold.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Only adding 1 month of gametime (this does not include the free month the recruited account gets) on the recruited account will only give you a month free on the main account. To get the mount the account you recruit has to buy 2 months of gametime, so to be honest, buying a physical gamecard seems the best option to me. The 2 months game time is added instantly and you can then claim the mount on your main account instantly. I just did this, and am now waiting for after the 17th (or it might be the 18th in the EU, as patches 'n stuff are a day later for us?) for it to switch from the rocket to Nightwing before I claim my mount :) Glad they are finally replacing the rocket, it looked terrible in my eyes.</div></div><hr />

That's because French, Chinese and Japanese realms are not in US battlegroups. France is an EU location and therefore sign on to EU servers. Latin servers should not be included in the US battlegroups as the primary language is not English/American.</div></div><hr />

Well in that case, then the EU cross language battlegroups should be removed too, as the French, German and Spanish don't have English as their primary language either. Or do you feel US battlegroups should get different treatment?</div></div><hr />

Sorry but not really. They didn't actually coincide, so no marketing trick.<br />
<br />
The discounted box set is not available. Blizzard discontinued the discounted box set BEFORE they ever announced the new RAF mount.<br />

Should square away those facts before making assumptions.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Indeed. In my opinion they should have announced them together, they probably would have sold more during the sale period. But at the same time, I can understand they didn't, as now people will be buying 2nd copies of the game to get the new RAF mount at the normal price, which will probably make them more profit than if they'd announced the sale and the new RAF mount at the same time. Can't be sure of this though of course, it is only a theory. Some people might have bought the game during the sale because of the RAF mount who originally wouldn't have bought a 2nd account, but at the same time now some people might buy the game at full price for the same reason. I guess them announcing the new RAF mount after the sale had finished will make them more profit.<br />
<br />
Luckily I found a Belgian store selling the Battlechest, WotLK and Cataclysm right now for €9,99 each, as I didn't buy them during the Blizzard store sale. However you don't need to upgrade the &quot;recruited&quot; account to WotLK or Cataclysm to claim the mount on your main account, as far as I'm aware (which is what I'm doing it for). But I bought WotLK and Cata for my &quot;recruited&quot; 2nd account anyway, seeing the cheap price. If for some reason I was ever to get perma banned on my main account (which is unlikely as I do nothing illegal, but you never know), I'll have a 2nd account ready to be upgraded to MoP :) <br />
<br />
+ while waiting for MoP I could try multiboxing the remaining classes I want to 85 and transfer the ones on 2nd account to main account... but tbh seeing how easy leveling is it would be a waste of €20 doing Character Transfer(s).</div></div><hr />

Well to be fair I haven't done much PvP, or played that much lately, but if I understand what you're saying, people in the Cyclone/Wirbelsturm battlegroup, with different locales will not be matched together by the dungeon finder? In that Battlegroup its English and German, so someone on an English Realm will never run a dungeon with someone from a German server?</div></div><hr />

The guy is just nuts, doesn't seem to understand anything. I'm guessing he grew up playing scoreless soccer games, getting gradeless report cards and feeling proud about his wall full of 'participant' ribbons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Sometimes players shouldn't be able to get the BiS gear and they shouldn't complain about it, since only a few people with decent/high skill should be able to.<br />
- Why? I mean, why with objective reasons. Not because some people need to be able to brag about the awesome gear they have that noone else can but dream of acquiring. <br />
<br />
I mean... arg. How simple is it to understand that not everyone is equal, that some people are simply better than others at certain things, or willing to put in more effort, do what it takes to improve, and that it's ok if they are able to do things that not everyone else can. It's even ok for them to be rewarded and recognized for being able to do things that not everyone else can. When someone sees a player with some cool item that feels out of reach, they shouldn't feel bad or get angry that they don't have it, they should feel motivated to get into a position where they can acquire it. This is basic stuff here that applies to all aspects of life, whether it's work, leisure or whatever.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
I like the example someone gave and you decided to ignore. 'We don't ask rooney, messi,... to play worse, so mike from next door can come play in the WC football'.<br />
- I ignored it because it's twisting my example just to try to make it sound unfair. Read my wording on that post. Would you enjoy being told that you can't play football because you can't perform at the level those football players do? Probably not.<br />
<br />
The comparison to your example in WoW terms would be asking Paragon to play worse so that Mike can join their guild, which is not what I suggested. Not. even. close.<br />
<br />
Yes Dreztal, asking Paragon to play worse so that 'Mike' can feel included is EXACTLY what you're saying should happen. You're just doing it by lowering the difficulty of all of the content (at the design stage) instead of directly handicapping the good players. He did the same thing with his basketball example, trying to claim that not everyone can be Jordan, so lowering the hoop a few feet would be fine.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Challenge is good.<br />
Overcoming challenges is fun.<br />
Being rewarded for overcoming challenges is good.<br />
The more difficult a challenge is, the more rewarding it is when you finally beat it.<br />
Being proud of accomplishing something in a video game IS PERFECTLY FINE.<br />
Lowering the bar so low that literally ANYONE can do something, completely removes any sense of value for accomplishing it.<br />

Well, it feels good to the folks who struggle with 25% Buff too. Most WoW players just can't seem to grasp how wide the chasm in skill between the individual players really is.<br />
<br />
And blizzard can't seem to grasp that the gap is so large because of the design choices they continue to make. You can't expect players to be anything but bad when level 1-85 is faceroll, and 85 content turns into faceroll before the majority of players even attempt it. Players will only improve if that's the only choice they're given. If blizzard actually tried, that improvement could come during the leveling curve, and during the ramp up from 80-84 dungeons, to 85, to heroics, to LFR, to normal raids, to heroic raids. Players who absolutely refuse to improve provide no value to the community, they actually harm it and probably cost blizzard subscriptions by making gameplay frustrating for everyone else.</div></div><hr />

Well either way, about US people complaining about being grouped with people who can't speak much english, you can't please everyone. How long have people been whining about the fact that queue times are too long? Pretty much since LFD came out... Blizzard does something about it to shorten them, and then people complain they don't want to be grouped with these people. It's one or the other really, personally I'd prefer shorter queues.</div></div><hr />
