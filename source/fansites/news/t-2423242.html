Prioritising. These are minor issues that are annoying at best, so they get fixed when everything else is working.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Now, now. Learn what prioritizing is and why it is used. Minor issues take a back seat to bigger issues for a reason.</div></div><hr />

Thanks, I would put that on top of the Alliance only bug along 2 quest in Drustvar that cannot be completed and an Elite World Quest (Old R'gal) that you cannot use the LFG on him so it's a absolute pain to get a group for and kill him. And yes, I did made bug report about both.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Easo</div><div class="date">2018-08-22, 02:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yeah, that trinket had 7k damage, split between all targets. That, obviously, was quite small amount.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Terracresta</div><div class="date">2018-08-22, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">And the Resilent Spellthreat was still not fixed? They can't even write a single line in one of the countless threads about it...<br />
<br />
Or at least changing the tooltip to state that it doesn't work mounted. Tested it unmounted and didn't get dazed.</div></div><hr />
