However, after the panel they had at Blizzcon I was less worried. <br />
<br />
But now all of this secret footage and talk about what was shown had put me into place where I don't care anymore. When it comes out, I'll see it. Until then, everything that's said about this movie means nothing to me.</div></div><hr />

To be honest, the movie's still nearly a year away. They don't need to start marketing it to general audiences yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They'll release a trailer when they're ready to do it. It's a year left. Why dissipate any interest a year out? Especially when you have to compete with Star Wars and Batman/Superman?<br />
<br />
We'll get everything. The film is looking nice from the stills. I have faith in Legendary and Blizz to do something awesome. Have some trust.</div></div><hr />

It's not the movie, it's previews. When they have an official trailer to show, they will allow people to see it from everywhere. People acting like little snotjobs over this must have some real issues with waiting for things...</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">guardian_titan</div><div class="date">2015-07-11, 11:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">When movie companies go out of their way to ensure something isn't leaked before release, I have to seriously wonder how good the movie really is. When movies aren't given a critic screening, those movies often bomb. Other movies, like John Carter and Scott Pilgrim vs the World were shown largely only to comic con audiences where they looked to be well liked ... until they got released. Then they both bombed. Is Universal hiding something about the movie that they won't let much get out? If there's nothing to hide, then why are they making all of these exclusive teasers that no one outside of a room will ever see?<br />
<br />
Blizzard's already causing many fans to walk away. Universal is driving more Warcraft fans away by continuously hiding the teasers/trailers. I had no intention of seeing the movie in theaters and likely won't see it until it's on Encore or HBO or perhaps even on FX/TBS/Syfy (that's IF I'm still into Warcraft then which doesn't look good), but I can see this irritating fans enough where they won't see it, either. I do realize Blizzard has little say in what Universal releases, but Universal needs to get off their high horse and stop treating fans like crap. Blizzard already is. They don't need to follow.</div></div><hr />

Why are people so anti-CGI these days...Avatar for example will probably hold just as strong 10 years from now as it did when released.

I fear for more Orc heavy shit. As an Ally and as a movie goer, general audiences, i think, will be thrown off by &quot;the bad guys&quot; (orcs) being a central focus. <br />

Well, they do use motion capture like in Avatar and the rebooted planet of the apes franchise. It can look great if they do it the right way or just aweful like in the hobbit trilogy compared to the LOTR trilogy.<br />
<br />
The movie is also almost 1 year away. They got plenty of time to render the footage they got now to make it look better and better. I wasn't ther at comic con so I dont really know how well made the foorage looked now, but I bet there is room for improvment.</div></div><hr />

Whether the average Joe cares for Warcraft lore or not, they'll be able to tell the orcs in the movie aren't necessarily the bad guys. That's kinda the whole point to showing the two factions.</div></div><hr />

I personally think it will be hard to get general audiences to car about orcs, I think there could end up being a lot of &quot;why was the focus not more on the humans?&quot; comments after the movie. <br />
I mean, I dont care too much, I will go see it and proly enjoy it. I just wonder if they will succeed in getting people new to Warcraft to care about orcs.</div></div><hr />

That is a HEAVY exception to the rule, especially at SDCC. For example, Suicide Squad's footage was exclusive to the Con, and that's been the case with almost every film showcased there in recent memory. Seriously, why does anyone find this surprising. This is common practice, especially when a film is nearly a year away. Yes, the practice sucks, I agree, but it is what it is.</div></div><hr />

Brushier eyebrows, protrude the brow a little more, and darken and sink the eyes. Further, the body type is human, needs to be beefed up more. Someone send Legendary the cinematics from Vanilla and TBC, or send the cinematics department over to show them how it's done.</div></div><hr />

Its often very noticeable and plasticy looking. <br />
<br />
<br />
I fear for more Orc heavy shit. As an Ally and as a movie goer, general audiences, i think, will be thrown off by &quot;the bad guys&quot; (orcs) being a central focus. <br />
<br />
Warcraft lore doesnt matter to people, only existing stereotypes, and those have orcs and those kind of beasties on the &quot;bad&quot; side of things.<br />
<br />
I think that if done right, people can realize pretty soon that these Orcs are not the same as say the Orcs of LOTR. It wouldn't be the first time people are able to side with the less mainstream characters, so to speak. &gt;.&gt;</div></div><hr />

Just as Jurassic Park still holds strong with the CGI even though it's old as dirt compared to other movies. Or maybe kids today see Jurassic Park and go &quot;That looks so fake!&quot; about the CGI stuff...that'd be sad.<br />
<br />
Jurassic Park used a lot of animatronics and it is still an amazing movie. Take a look a Star Wars Episode 1-3... Heavy CGI, JJ Abrams learned from this and kept a lot of things out of CGI with the Force Awakens.. I don't mind CGI but if you CGI a great deal of it you might as well make an animated movie. Or maybe kids today are so attached to CGI and thats all they care about.. How sad..</div></div><hr />

Don't think so, well-made CGI with a good story will probably trump everything to most people. Just as movies with a good story and no CGI at all can win audiences. Kids below a certain age will probably not be critical either way.</div></div><hr />

That definitely doesn't seem like Legendary. The idiots behind Blizzard are probably trying to prevent most people from seeing it until Blizzcon. Gotta get those sales up because I doubt they'll have much to talk about this year. <br />

<br />
Doing well at the box office...really strong argument bro. Popularity does not equal quality. The transformers sequels are some of the most watched films in cinema history, says it all. The hobbit triology were terrible films, with terrible characters. <br />
<br />
* Elf - dwarf love story, really? <br />
* Terrible ending to the second film with Smaug making a fool of himself somehow not managing to kill even a single dwarf. &quot;Hey, over here!!&quot; Really PJ?<br />
* Overly use of CGI made the world feel like plastic, and makes you lose all immersion. Somehow they spent a shitton more money than they did on Lotr, yet still managed to make it look worse (Smaug looked great though, I'll give them that). When the characters are fighting it doesn't feel like they're actually hitting the enemies...because they aren't. Dwarves fighting in the caves is the best example, also Dain &quot;headbutting&quot; people in the newest one. Compare to Lord of the Rings where all the fights feel real and thus way more thrilling to watch.<br />
* Spending time on terrible characters such as Alfrid (no idea why he got so much screentime, there isn't even a resolution to his character-arc), Legolas (should've had a small cameo role max) and Radagast (druidic wizard type in the books, reduced to utter silly and lame comedy relief here)<br />
*Insane amount of filler scenes that makes little sense. Radagast already saw the Witch-king, gave Gandalf a morgul blade..why does Gandalf have to travel to the High fells or wherever it was to confirm that they Nazgul are free, when he's going to Dol guldur after anyway? Because they want three films, and need useless filler scenes like this to fill in the time. <br />
*Too much dumb &quot;hollywood humour&quot;, too little of Tolkien's charm. The few times they truly try to follow the spirit of the book, it works like a charm: The good morning, what do you mean good morning scene in the start, Riddles in the Dark....also one of the very last scenes in the triology with Bilbo and Gandalf smoking their pipes. Not in the books, but very Tolkienish and good.<br />
<br />

I'm tired of this release a trailer over 12 months before bullshit. I remember episode three's hype train being so long I was just pissed off that I was waiting.<br />

Release the trailer and people will complain until the movie comes out. Hold the trailer and people will complain until the movie comes out. They'll never win so they should just wait. I would prefer trailers to air ~3 or so months before the movie comes out in theaters.</div></div><hr />

I don't think they were &quot;fake&quot;<br />
I think people came to their own conclusions and heard/saw what they wanted to.<br />

<br />
When I first heard about the Warcraft movie I was very interested in seeing it. But as time went along and I heard more and more rumors about it being Orc focused I wasn't so sure anymore. Especially after the last 2 or 3 expansions. Now that I am seeing that at least some of the rumors were true I have totally lost interest. I'm that tired of Orcs. The art and graphics look fantastic, but as of right now, I'm very, very burnt out on any more Orc centric stories. Maybe I'm just not wrapping my head around the fact that Warcraft is Orc centric in the first place very well. I dunno.<br />
<br />
I am going to watch the trailer when it comes out in November and perhaps I will be pleasantly surprised and totally change my mind. But as of right now, nope. For those of you who are excited and stuff I hope you have a good time when you go see it (no sarcasm, honest). :)</div></div><hr />

If they were going to push virtual ticket sales with a trailer showing it wouldn't be in the Opening ceremony, as that's traditionally free to watch for everyone.<br />

Personally, I don't mind CGI. If the entire film was done in a Blizzard cinematic style I'd watch it. I'm not overly hyped, I plan to go and watch it, but I'd be fucking over the moon if it was planned to be a feature length of Blizzard's standard.</div></div><hr />

Box Office $ doesn't translate into a good well made movie...Like someone already said Transformers is perfect example...The last one made a boatload in the box office it was the worst piece of trash i ever saw..I turned it off in the last 45 minutes...I couldn't bare to watch another minute...The whole time i felt that way. Couldn't give two shits on how it ended....Hobbit was exact same way...It made a ton because people were on the LOTR train hoping it would be the same and Hobbit has had a established large following for a long ass time, that's why it made money...Not because it was good....It was horrible bad...Completely butchered..Was a CGI movie that was tuned towards 12 year olds with no seriousness or thought behind it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Antherios</div><div class="date">2015-07-12, 02:38 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">*The footage basically starts off with clips of the orcs and their lives in a desolate wasteland that is dying.

*This leads to them making their way through the dark portal into the world of Azeroth thanks to the help of warlock Gul'dan with his death magic.<br />
*Of course The Alliance discovers them, think the Orc are dangerous, and they go to war!<br />
<br />
<br />
Soooo.. are they going to retcon the reason behind the orcs invading Azeroth? <br />
<br />
Seeing how they are portraying the orcs by making them look more human, I think they will try to make them more relatable to the audience.<br />
I think we can expect no Mannoroth blood drinking being showed, and no orcs going on a rage fueled killing rampage on the human settlements on Black Morass or anything of the like.<br />
Also, they will try to make it appear like the Orcs didn't have other choice than attacking Azeroth, or maybe show the Orc generals as warmongers that the general orc race don't support, but have to obey.</div></div><hr />

How about this: <br />
<br />
&quot;In this universe, Gul'dan is actually a good guy. He knew that a great sacrifice must be made to provide a future for his people, and he willingly went along with the legion to ensure his people would survive. The legion promised a new world for them to settle on, a lush planet. All they had to do was open a portal and travel there and defeat the evil inhabitants of the new world.&quot;<br />

Also, they'd better not gloss over the fact that the Orcs were the ones who messed up Draenor. Yes, demons tricked them, but they still did it, and most of them were still blood-crazed and ready for war at this point. If they don't even mention the genocide of the Draenei I'm gonna be annoyed.</div></div><hr />

Pretty close. It's more like a movie adaptation of a book. There are changes and yet... both are canon? That's why this stuff is annoying and a headache. Plus you have people worried they'll retcon the games for the movie.</div></div><hr />

It is in the sense that movie adaptations create differences with their main source. Remember that whole bit about Dalaran flying in the movie mentioned months back? That's one example.<br />
<br />
Anyway, IIRC it was said that the movie lore would stay in its own universe</div></div><hr />

Like every other time people have complained before, this decision would not have had anything to do with Duncan Jones. The marketing people at Legendary Pictures are making us wait, not the film's director.</div></div><hr />

- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
Anyway I'm not worried. We knew it would be CGI heavy from the start, that doesn't mean it will flop. Whatever you thought of films like Avatar or the Hobbit they did manage to be financially successful and heavy use of CGI does not preclude a good story. Lots of CGI is necessary for the story of warcraft. <br />
<br />
The lore changes are being blown out of proportion. In the initial lore Draenor was dying, because of the demonic corruption. I do see a slight possibility of them making a big change, where the Orc homeworld is dying for other reasons, and they drink the demon blood in order to fight the humans. But there's no reason to jump to conclusions. I think that the origin story with the demon blood and the slaughter of the Draenei will be kept in. We'll start off with the Frostwolves who initially refused to join the Horde and drink the demonblood. But as Draenor continues to deteriorate they are forced to join the invasion of Azeroth and Orgrim at least decides to drink the demon blood.</div></div><hr />

Indeed. Shallow people dismissing a great cast because it's not part of the usual Hollywood line-up...now where have I see that before...hmmm...Oh yeah, fucking Lord of the Rings. <br />
<br />
I can't wait to see Ben Foster's Medivh. He was brilliant in Hostage and carried the entire movie. Then he stole a big portion of the show in 3:10 to Yuma together with names like Christian Bale and Russel Crowe. Toby Kebbell has been a household name here ever since his portrayal of Johnny Quid in RockNRolla. Dominic Cooper was amazeballs in Devil's Double. Haven't seen the woman playing Garona in much, but she was anything but a &quot;sub-par&quot; actor in Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol.</div></div><hr />

Better than the Hobbit? Better than Avatar.... i fucking doubt it.<br />
<br />
Neither of those are very good films. Great effects, yes, but not great from a filmmaking perspective in my opinion. Avatar is far, far better than The Hobbit in my opinion though. The Hobbit films were relatively awful, especially in comparison to the LotR films.<br />
<br />
On topic, I'm very curious to see the actual trailer. There is potential for this movie to be really good.<br />
A bit too much noble Orc stuff in the recaps they posted though. In the first war and by extension Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, the orcs are all green skinned, corrupted, and and massacring Azeroth with reckless abandon. I'm sure much of that has been retconned, but playing the Orc campaign in that game you see pure evil from the orcs, not a race trying to survive or save their Homeworld.</div></div><hr />

The &quot;brutal/savage/alien race/person isn't actually bad, just misunderstood/actually the good guys&quot; storyline has been done a billion times. Avatar. I am Legend. Fuck, pick a Disney movie (Pocahontas, Tarzan, Beauty and the Beast, etc etc etc). I don't think they'll have any problem &quot;selling&quot; it to anybody with spare braincells. <br />
<br />
This will have mainstream appeal from all sorts of nerd outlets, on top of the sizable existing Warcraft/Blizzard fanbase. To me, there's very little chance of it being some kind of financial disaster. I know it's trendy to simply assume everything Blizzard does will be shit lately (mostly due to the ludicrous expectations of an increasingly toxic fanbase) but people are grasping hard at straws. Movies don't normally get full length cinematic trailers a year before release, yet for some reason people abandon reason and trash Blizz for not doing one yet. Given the amount of CGI I see, I'm gonna assume this movie took years to put together, and they were kind enough to share that with diehards at conventions the last few years...yet here I sit, reading comments from people shitting on the company for sharing things they have absolutely zero obligation to show to anyone.<br />

Now of course the actual movie will look better and focus on Orc's too much, because they are supposed to *spoilers* be the heroes in this film, so the audience doesn't feel bad when the humans lose the first war So I hope my hate for Orcs will have subsided by then by hopefully a NON-Orc focused expansion being announced at Blizzcon.

The story begins with orcs vs humans. There will be other races present when it suits the timeline. It's like you're asking for vol'jin to come through the portal. They're not ignoring the other races. This is BEFORE THE ALLIANCE AND HORDE WERE FORMED.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually, Warlords of Draenor was made for exactly the reason that Metzen said it was. ALOT of people never got the chance to see or experience Orcs vs Humans and to see some of these characters when they were in their prime (Hellscream, Blackhand, Gul'dan, Durotan, Khadgar, Garona, etc). This expansion has served as an introduction to many of these characters for some people (like me). For myself, I'm really excited to see these characters come to life on the big screen cause I want to see more of them. The decision to take the expansion in this direction probably came hand and hand once they knew the direction upon which the movie was going to take.<br />
<br />
The movie universe isn't the same as the game universe. They never will be. It's like others have said already.. just have to look at Marvel.. their comics and movies are separate.</div></div><hr />

It's more like a movie adaptation of a book. There are changes and yet... both are canon? That's why this stuff is annoying and a headache. Plus you have people worried they'll retcon the games for the movie.<br />
<br />
I'm pretty sure this is considered fleshing out of the original story. The thing is, the Warcraft games before 3 didn't have fully, robust stories. They were basically walls of texts before a mission. The first game even had an alternate ending where the Alliance won. So, this story is ripe to be re-worked to fit the current Azeroth Lore. The game is already shaped a lot by the novels which came out before it. This is going to actually show us what happened that lead to the world we plan in now. There will likely be changes to the original game, but that's fine because most of those things were generic and not even part of the story we know today. Deep breath, though, I assure you it will all work out.<br />
<br />
<br />
It is in the sense that movie adaptations create differences with their main source. Remember that whole bit about Dalaran flying in the movie mentioned months back? That's one example.<br />
<br />
Anyway, IIRC it was said that the movie lore would stay in its own universe<br />
<br />
I don't think you remember correctly. There's nothing about Dalaran flying. I was at Blizzcon, I saw the footage there and people like to make wild predictions based on nothing. You see Dalaran for half a second. We'll see more when we actually get a trailer.<br />
<br />
I don't think you remember correctly, either. Find the source of that statement.<br />
<br />
As I noted above, the story of the first war is very lacking (WoW even retconned some of it with Burning Crusade), so this is a chance to flesh it out. The fact that all Blizzard Novels are canon along with graphic novels, I doubt they'd make a non-canon movie.<br />

<br />
The second did have an alternate ending where the Orcs won. I was just talking about the first game in relation to the movie. The official canon ending of War2 is the Alliance winning.<br />
<br />
The whole first game, though, was split between Human/Orc campaigns but mostly only the Orc side was canon with a few details from the Alliance side. The Alliance side was mostly alternate since they didn't actually defend their cities and were defeated. The second game did a better job of interweaving storytelling between the two campaigns.<br />

The plots of Warcraft 1 and 2 might have been thin but they were also pretty simple. The Orcs did commit genocide, and they tried to do it multiple times. They invaded Azeroth completely unprovoked and murder murder murder murder murder murder murdered their way through the south half of Eastern Kingdoms. They assailed the Dwarves, enslaved the Red dragonflight, and just kept on murdering. This is laid out in very easy-to-read paragraphs by Blizzard's own website: us.battle.net/wow/en/game/the-story-of-warcraft/chapter1 <br />
<br />
I feel pretty confident this narrative is going to get whitewashed and revised by the movie, and I think that's a very bad thing, much to the pooh-poohing of some people on this thread. <br />
<br />
On a different note, movie trailers are usually supposed to elicit eager anticipation, not resentment. Holding the release of a simple trailer until a paid-ticket event seems incredibly miserly. It doesn't feel exciting and exclusive to me, it feels petty and punitive.<br />

This movie gives the same vib. These people know ahead of time when something is going to suck. But the die is cast, the development money is commited and they are forced by their corporate bosses to put on the best happy face they can and try to spin things. <br />

I was just talking about the first game in relation to the movie. The official canon ending of War2 is the Alliance winning.<br />
<br />
The whole first game, though, was split between Human/Orc campaigns but mostly only the Orc side was canon with a few details from the Alliance side. The Alliance side was mostly alternate since they didn't actually defend their cities and were defeated. The second game did a better job of interweaving storytelling between the two campaigns.<br />
<br />
Infracted<br />
<br />
Don't forget that when the orcs won the first war, they completely slaughtered the humans of Stormwind City and burned it and the keep to the ground. They even started practicing the necromancy that lead Ner'zhul to eventually become the Lich King on the fallen Stormwind residents. <br />
<br />
The humans formed the Alliance with the dwarves and the high elves and some gnomes, because the orcs were threatening their other kingdoms as well, plus the orcs had made friends with the trolls and goblins, as well as started bringing more ogres with them (the first Warcraft had at least one ogre in it). United, the new Alliance was able to push the Horde's forces back through the dark portal and destroy it, although many Alliance heroes were trapped on the other side of the portal as well. <br />
<br />
Yet, orcs are the good guys and just misunderstood and manipulated people. Drinking demon blood was not their fault at all.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">CthulhuFhtagn</div><div class="date">2015-07-12, 09:19 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Remember the Blizzcon where WoD was discussed in detail? Remember how many people commented that the Blizzard presenters seemed glum and downcast? It was commonly remarked that nobody at Blizzard seemed excited when they talked about WoD. <br />
<br />
This movie gives the same vib. These people know ahead of time when something is going to suck. But the die is cast, the development money is commited and they are forced by their corporate bosses to put on the best happy face they can and try to spin things. <br />
<br />
When this movie bombs Blizzard is going to be hurting, especially if WoW has bled out half it's remaining subscriptions. And doubly especially if people get tired of tossing buckets of money at incredibly shallow games like Hearthstone.<br />
<br />
Have you seen the movie panel at Blizzcon? They were fucking thrilled to talk about it. From what we saw of the panel the same was true here, just that there was so little time for it. And Duncan has been gushing in every interview how excited he is about it and that he believes it's a great movie.<br />
<br />
<br />
It's pretty hard to make the Orcs out to be anything but villains. The plots of Warcraft 1 and 2 might have been thin but they were also pretty simple. The Orcs did commit genocide, and they tried to do it multiple times. They invaded Azeroth completely unprovoked and murder murder murder murder murder murder murdered their way through the south half of Eastern Kingdoms. They assailed the Dwarves, enslaved the Red dragonflight, and just kept on murdering. This is laid out in very easy-to-read paragraphs by Blizzard's own website: us.battle.net/wow/en/game/the-story-of-warcraft/chapter1 <br />
<br />
I feel pretty confident this narrative is going to get whitewashed and revised by the movie, and I think that's a very bad thing, much to the pooh-poohing of some people on this thread. <br />
<br />
On a different note, movie trailers are usually supposed to elicit eager anticipation, not resentment. Holding the release of a simple trailer until a paid-ticket event seems incredibly miserly. It doesn't feel exciting and exclusive to me, it feels petty and punitive.<br />
<br />
Oh well.<br />
<br />
Blackhand and Gul'dan aren't getting whitewashed and Durotan was always the good guy. Orgrim is the only one who might differ, but I believe he was already retconned as a more sympathetic character in Rise of the Horde and subsequent material.<br />
<br />
Trailer will go public at Blizzcon, you wont have to be there to see it. Also, the timing fits Universal's model for trailer release, so we would have gotten it around that time anyways.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">illindarious</div><div class="date">2015-07-12, 09:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Of course they have to spend sometimes telling the Orc's side of the story. If all they do is to paint the orcs as evil, you might as well just watch The Lords of the Rings. <br />
It is already all too easy for people to hate the orcs just from their looks alone. I think it is wise to build up the Orcs first because everyone knows what the humans are like already. You don't have to spend a lot of time with them.<br />
<br />
The story of the orcs is fine as it is though. Focusing on their story shouldn't be a problem either. They start off being tribal and savage, but honorable in their own way.. but they do get manipulated by the demons because they want power. They become evil, at least the majority of them. There should be no getting around that. After the dark portal is destroyed, many of them have withdrawals from the demonic power that was tearing Draenor apart and it weakened them. Some even had regrets. Eventually they broke free from complete demon control when Grom killed Mannoroth, thus redeeming them for the most part. After that, they can be be considered good in a sense, but after drinking the blood and before the death of Mannoroth; they weren't very good at all. <br />
<br />
Making it seem like orcs were the heroes at this time period just doesn't make sense. Still, we don't really know how the movie will go.<br />
<br />

<br />
Durotan was always the good guy. <br />
<br />
<br />
Maybe so, although he still drank the demon blood as well. He's just one of the few orcs that felt guilty about it later. Of course there were also the orcs that refused to drink the blood.. but they didn't even go into Azeroth during the first two wars.</div></div><hr />

Seriously, that lady needs to go and needs to go now. Second boss in HC, with her yells in the background, is even worse than Iron Maidens, and that was HORRIBLE. &quot;Rabbit Fire!&quot; &quot;Death!&quot; &quot;Too slow!&quot; over and over and over and over and over and over and over again.<br />
<br />
I would quote this post several times if I could. I'm sick of hearing Chris &quot;Friggin' Loves His Own Voice&quot; Metzen do every other major character. And Orc Female VO, whoever it is, either needs far fewer characters assigned to her or some better writing or both.

Nope, given that nobody really cares for boring Alliance. I mean &quot;we are the good guys..we just slaughter here a bit...and there a bit...and practice some questionable magic once in a while&quot; is not exactly what makes interesting characters. All the Alliance had was Arthas...maybe the eternal negative Varian and the obsessive Jaina. Compare that to characters like Thrall, Durotan, Orgrim, Rexxar, Sylvanas. Those are strong characters. And let's not forget: Orcs and walking Cows are just way more interesting to look at than human races(no matter if they are small or have pointed ears...). You want a special movie: Choose horde. You want just another movie in a medival setting: Choose Alliance. Simple as that.</div></div><hr />

Someone from here that was at Comic-con and can talk about this sentence from io9?<br />
<br />
We see the aforementioned Gulâdan on a massive cliff with the Dark Portal from the games behind him. âDead, alive, dead, alive,â he slowly chants. He reveals that a thousand soldiers need a thousand slaves - prisoners, not corpses - as fuel for the Fel. Then what appears to be the souls of these awkward purple humanoids are sucked out, down into Gulâdanâs staff, and then explode out to open the huge green portal and the orcs begin to run through<br />

This. <br />
<br />
Plus, while I do not think there is a conspiracy or deliberate disparaging of &quot;fans&quot; by not showing a trailer now they have absolutely NOTHING to gain by showing anything to most of the people who have been posting here about the movie. There is no chance that anyone posting on MMOC is not going to see the movie when it comes out, no matter how much they claim to hate Duncan, Legendary, Blizzard, or Metzen for making them wait. There is also no such thing as wanting to see a movie MORE. You are either seeing it and buying a ticket or not so if the things they have to show are amazing, it doesnt get them anything as that ticket sale was already more or less locked in and if its not great, or still rough anything they show now will just get nit picked and torn apart over the next few months just like every blizzard announcement about a product or patch or interview. See the posters, the &quot;stormwind statues&quot;, Durotan, Garona, etc. <br />
<br />
They need to put their money, time, and energy into selling this movie to the people who go see transformers, fast and furious, lord of the rings, harry potter, marvel, etc. The people who are actually going to make or break this movie.<br />

Am I the only one who's starting to believe that WoD was basically only made to introduce WoW fans to the good old characters like Hellscream, Khadgar etc so they would be more excited about the movie?<br />
<br />
I do not believe that but even as a long time warcraft fan back to tides of darkness, if that was the intent it worked. <br />
<br />
I only played multiplayer for WC2 and did not finish the WC3 campaign (mostly mp). World of Warcraft and some of the novels were my first true introduction to the &quot;lore&quot; side of the franchise and while WoD isn't turning out to be my absolute favorite expansion it HAS been kind of cool to see the old warchiefs and it HAS made me a little more interested in the general timeline and characters they are tackling in the movie. <br />
<br />
I think the worst you could say is that they have had this time period and these characters on their minds for a long time because of prepping for this movie with Rami and Jones and it finally blossomed into an idea they felt like tackling after they really got a lock on some of Garrosh's motivations and anger during MoD.</div></div><hr />

ALOT of people never got the chance to see or experience Orcs vs Humans and to see some of these characters when they were in their prime (Hellscream, Blackhand, Gul'dan, Durotan, Khadgar, Garona, etc). This expansion has served as an introduction to many of these characters for some people (like me). For myself, I'm really excited to see these characters come to life on the big screen cause I want to see more of them. The decision to take the expansion in this direction probably came hand and hand once they knew the direction upon which the movie was going to take.<br />
<br />
The movie universe isn't the same as the game universe. They never will be. It's like others have said already.. just have to look at Marvel.. their comics and movies are separate.<br />
<br />
For now...<br />
<br />
Metzen says... that guy will do and say whatever he can/wants to keep you on the hook.<br />
<br />
Look I loved (past tense) WoD, i might have even loved it more than WotLK. I think I have been subscribed continuously now to WoD longer than I was to WotLK.<br />
<br />
But is glaringly obvious that they are quickly wrapping up WoD (for reasons unknown... call it subs, call it what you want) ahead of schedule and rushing into the next xpac. I think it makes me a little jaded considering there are a lot of little issues with WoD, in the past we would see a much more polished product, and very quick and diligent effort to fix issues. This xpac has not done that, it is clear that it is &quot;not worth their time to fix&quot; when we are already poised to jump into another xpac.<br />
<br />
Maybe I just need to change my mindset and attachment to my characters and time invested. Because more in more this game is being treated much like Activision's CoD franchise. Where they are more comfortable with a less polished game as it will be irrelvant in 365 days anyway.</div></div><hr />

Avatar, a movie that made 2 billion dollars worldwide. <br />
I surely do hope it will be &quot;another Avatar&quot; just for the pure succes of that movie.<br />
<br />
Just a decent story and nice effects will do it for me. And a big big wish it doesn't flop like other game to movie adaptations.</div></div><hr />

Orcs are super necessary to tell WC1's story, I don't get why people are upset? Maybe because Blizzard shot themselves in the foot with 2 back to back Orc Expacs I guess?<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, now realizing that WoD probably was made to introduce players to the Characters in the film.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they continue ruining the immersion and character/class distinction as well as the dismantling of the world and it's danger at the speed they currently show... no one's going to be around for the movie.</div></div><hr />
