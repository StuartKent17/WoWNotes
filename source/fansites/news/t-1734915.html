Spirit Trinkets Buff<br />
Yep, you would think after almost 30 pages of discussion on this earlier in the week they would have listened to what was being said... I don't think more spirit was ever suggested to make the stat more desirable for healers.<br />
That's not something that can be fixed with a numbers buff to two trinkets. This change was to address that the two trinkets in question were under budget relative to other trinkets. That's all.<br />
<br />
Just to help clarify, on top of what Rygarius said: These changes were made because the items were under budget and not giving the appropriate amount of stats for their item level. There was a bug, so we fixed it.<br />
<br />
This was not a change made to make healers more interested in Spirit trinkets. We recognize that Spirit isn't the most appealing stat for healers at the moment, and are discussing how we want to handle that, but that's a separate issue than the one that prompted the changes to these trinkets.

Gonna put a tinfoil hat for this.<br />
<br />
Pretty sure their entire team is working on the next expansion. Considering they are outsourcing art for WoD they probably have very little people working on 6.2.<br />
<br />
I suspect they don't give two shits about WoD and that the next expansion is going to be released early next year.</div></div><hr />

Legacy of the Void will be close to release by then. Lots to talk about that. Overwatch will be big with beta having just started. Heroes of the Storm is ever expanding.</div></div><hr />

Gonna have to disagree with you, at least push back 6.2 half a month, all the raid finder stuff won't be out till the end of March, after that they have at least 3 months till the next patch. That being said I don't think 6.2 will have a raid.</div></div><hr />

What makes you think that if they have 3 tiers it will be 10 months? That will just push the next expansion further. People aren't just magically going to appear to work on the third tier.</div></div><hr />

I think the 10 months is the time between the last raid and expansion launch</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duster505</div><div class="date">2015-03-12, 06:06 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seems like Blizzard is only thinking about Blizzcon rather than actually let their games do the talking. More and more negative comments coming from players and most of them very fair and to the point. Blizzard on the other hand... Has to hide behind drooling fans and total PR+lies during Blizzcon. <br />
<br />
Gone are the days when Blizzard made games for the gamers. Cause if they did - they would actually listen to what the gamers are saying. Instead - they need fanboys to make themselfs look good during BLizzcon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they announce next WOW expansion during Blizzcon - we would STILL be on a 2 year release progress. Blizzard has stated they are fine with just two raid tiers and players are NOT going to wait for 2 years for next expansion. It will always need 6-8 months MINIMUM for testing after announched so BLizzard will be shooting themselfs in the foot by waiting so long.</div></div><hr />

Yeah ik he meant that. But DS was 12 months and SoO was 13. Don't see why this would change now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It needs to change cause Blizzard has stated very clearly that 13 months is not acceptable. And considering ppl are talking about just 2 raid tiers and then a 10 month gap... Thats even worse than waiting 13 months with 3 raid tiers. Simply not acceptable.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tziva</div><div class="date">2015-03-12, 06:14 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Not worried about the timeline for WoW expacs just yet. It depends on whether Warlords gets more than two tiers and also whether the next expansion is announced at Blizzcon or before.<br />

I look forward to Blizzcon every year and seeing my friends that I only see a few times a year (or less), so I'm excited!</div></div><hr />

And I think we all can agree that they can not be trusted on anything they say anymore :) That's why they need the fanboys around them cheering at Blizzcon when they talk their biggest PR bullcrap.</div></div><hr />

There's cheering at Blizzcon? Every time I watch a Blizzcon it feels like I'm watching a zombie flick.</div></div><hr />

It's because they mute the crowd during the trailers. The cheering vibe is actually pretty big. I get the chills during those crowd reaction videos. Those are always the best.</div></div><hr />

It's actually a function of the crowd not having mics with a direct line to the audio mixer. A lot of live broadcasts are like that (although commonly with concerts they have mics set up specifically to pick up the crowd).</div></div><hr />

Hmm.<br />
<br />
I know it's still early but...<br />
<br />
I expect them to feature the following things:<br />
<br />
Next WoW Expansion (duh)<br />
Diablo III Expansion<br />
Hearthstone Expansion<br />
New HoTS stuff<br />
Overwatch Beta Talk<br />
Maybe show what the Starcraft team is going to be doing after LotV. (WC trilogy remaster anyone?)<br />
<br />
Also expect them to show exclusive first look Warcraft movie stuff. The movie will be out in 4 months at that point, so even virtual ticket holders should get something to look at. Also maybe a new game? This should be a good blizzcon indeed. Lots of potential in this one.</div></div><hr />

That's because when you watch the vitural ticket, the background noise is almost eliminated. But when you their in person sometimes you can't hear yourself think.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure their entire team is working on the next expansion. Considering they are outsourcing art for WoD they probably have very little people working on 6.2.<br />
<br />
I suspect they don't give two shits about WoD and that the next expansion is going to be released early next year.<br />
<br />
Nah, I think 6.2 will be a very good patch, but that will be the only patch we get this expansion. Think 6.1 and 6.2 content rolled into one patch. Tanaan is a huge zone too. After that, they have from June-likely March to finish the expansion which is rumors are true is playable now. Expecting announcement and beta in December. Release in late March. 9-10 months of 6.2 is acceptable to me. Its the best last tier wait since Sunwell if not better. Am I being too optomistic?</div></div><hr />

Assuming 6-7 months from highmaul launch means next tier is somewhere around June or July, a standard length announce to launch would make that tier around 15-18 months long?</div></div><hr />

Blizzcon 2015 - WoW x 6 announced<br />

The only question is if they can get it shipped in 2016. Patch 6.4 should be out early 2016, so the expansion needs to drop before next year's Blizzcon if they want to escape the content droughts.</div></div><hr />

Which is bullshit, especially when the announced tells us we are being summons to Anaheim for Blizzcon. What it should say is 200 lucky people will be summoned. They should sell as many tickets as there are people willing to buy one instead of limiting them. Most big shows around me never limit sales, whether it be auto shows, hunting/camping shows, farm show, dog show, etc...

Blizzcon was good last year for non Warcraft players. For Warcraft fans it sucked.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
why are some people claiming there won't be a raid tier in 6.2? have blizzard ever release two non raid patches in a row? 6.1 and 6.2 no tier would cause people to quit fersure.<br />
<br />
People have lost faith in Blizzard, so they are being extra pessimistic. Can you blame them? Non instanced end game for 6.0 was lacking, and 6.1 sucked. 6.2 has to be amazing or WoD is a bust. I personally think they will pull 6.2 off, but who knows at this point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh I agree that it is entirely too optimistic, if they actually want to avoid content droughts though it is going to have to be something accelerated like that. The PTR for the next expansion won't be active until after Blizzcon so that they actually have something to excite people with and at best the ptr is going to have to be up for six months, so that is why I am setting the drop date as 05/05/2016. <br />
<br />
Now, if the next raid tier is going to be the last one this expansion, they could drag the tiers out to nine months and with some good content in 6.2 and 6.4 it wouldn't feel like too long.<br />

<br />
What the hell are you talking about?<br />
<br />
1. Where are you getting 200 people? There were close to 30,000 people at blizzcon 2014 and who knows how many watching virtually. <br />
2. I can promise you EVERY trade show has a limit to how many people can attend, even if they do not have to advertise it because a capacity crowd would never show up to whatever local auto show you think is in any way comparable to a big media event like PAX, E3, Comic Con, CES, etc. Even if you set aside fire code limits, at some point the show simply cannot staff the right amount of people to cover a capacity crowd and attendee satisfaction drops.

1. Where are you getting 200 people? There were close to 30,000 people at blizzcon 2014 and who knows how many watching virtually. <br />
2. I can promise you EVERY trade show has a limit to how many people can attend, even if they do not have to advertise it because a capacity crowd would never show up to whatever local auto show you think is in any way comparable to a big media event like PAX, E3, Comic Con, CES, etc. Even if you set aside fire code limits, at some point the show simply cannot staff the right amount of people to cover a capacity crowd and attendee satisfaction drops. Ask anyone who's been to comic con in the last 4 years and can't even get into a big panel without camping out for 24 hours in line. <br />

A football field yes, but the stadium has a lot more places than the field. The concourses on multiple levels, vendor areas etc.. Also the main stage could be on the field and 80000+ could watch it from the stands</div></div><hr />

<br />
Please stop it. No one needs you to armchair quarterback Blizzcon, especially from this completely impractical position. First of all, as hard as this might be to believe, LA does not HAVE a major football stadium to host your fantasy event in. We have two college level football stadiums, neither of which have multiple levels or indoor vendor areas. Our baseball stadiums MIGHT work but i think you are dramatically underestimating how many people you can put on a concourse level at any one time and have room for booths, presentation areas, demo stages, dining, walkways, etc. Additionally, the main field view would be WAY worse from almost any seat in the house than what is found in hall D at the Anaheim convention center. What are you thinking??<br />
<br />
I have been to all 8 Blizzcons. The last thing that it needs is more people. This is not comic con where we want to cram 150 thousand people into the halls to look at bullshit merchandise and consume ads for upcoming products. The ENTIRE point of Blizzcon is to let the fans and developers meet and celebrate the company and it's games and employees, all of whom work very hard to make some of the best and most popular computer games that have ever existed (indisputable, no matter how much anyone thinks WOW or D3 sucks now or whatever). 30,000 attendees is pushing the limits for the kind of experience they are looking to deliver. <br />
<br />
It is already difficult to attend the show and get into the main hall for the big announcements. Most people who do will be watching it on a TV screen because they are 50-100 yards away from the main stage. Once that is over, a big draw for the convention is playing demos for the newly announced games. The line to play Overwatch last year was incredibly lengthy all day both days (deservedly so). The line for heroes of the storm the year before was equally lengthy. Adding more people would require a complete overhaul in how they do the demos. Simply adding more machines is not practical as there needs to be an on site server to connect to and handle the load. Adding more machines, more servers, more cables and power and chairs and monitors, and people to monitor said network and usher people to their seats and collect feedback would be expensive and difficult to manage and possibly not worth it for a two day convention. <br />
<br />
Another major draw for the convention is to meet the developers who make your favorite game. Maybe get a signature on a poster or game box, get 5 seconds to tell them how much you really liked the gold card animation for a hearthstone card, or how cool a monster in D3 was. Whatever it is. Those lines are also already pushing reasonable capacity. You cannot expect an employee to sit there all day simply signing things and even if they did, Blizzard is a big company with a lot of people and they all deserve a chance to meet the fans and for us to meet them, which means either rotating the employees out (which they do) and someone missing a chance to meet them, or adding a TON more space for them to sit. <br />
<br />
I could go on and on about why adding more people to Blizzcon creates difficulties and diminishes the experience for everyone (staff, employees, and attendees) but i think you get the picture. I've attended San Diego Comic Con and Pax. I DO NOT want Blizzcon to end up like those shows where you simply cannot do certain things because the probability when competing with 150,000 other people makes it impossible. I want to meet the developers, get my posters signed, tell them what i like about the games, and play the newest demos. If i cannot get a ticket for the 9th time in a row, i will be sad and I will get over it. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of things they could do to improve the blizzcon experience. None of what you have suggested would be practical or an improvement.</div></div><hr />

Pretty sure their entire team is working on the next expansion. Considering they are outsourcing art for WoD they probably have very little people working on 6.2.<br />
<br />
I suspect they don't give two shits about WoD and that the next expansion is going to be released early next year.<br />
<br />
I seem to remember one of the Blues stating earlier that most of the content for WoD is already finished or near completion. So it really doesn't bother me that they are for the most part done with this expansion... as long as I get three raid tiers and get to play around on Draenor until the 2016 Holiday season.</div></div><hr />

So the one thing they should do this year to improve over last year is release the online BlizzCon store immediately after the opening ceremony. That line was crazy long (from 12-4, in the line).<br />
<br />
Open up a couple store fronts upstairs (2nd floor is normally Press and Staff areas, 3rd was the WoW movie preview last year and had plenty of space), and use the rest of the show floor for booths.

Yes the store was especially terrible last year. having the register clerks place the counter order and check it with the grabbers and then check it with the customer was a terrible, terrible decision. They also needed order forms and more supervisors to help with returns and missing items.</div></div><hr />

why are some people claiming there won't be a raid tier in 6.2? have blizzard ever release two non raid patches in a row? 6.1 and 6.2 no tier would cause people to quit fersure.<br />

Blizzard would be committing seppuku if they release 6.2 without a raid tier. No way in hell that would ever happen no matter how pessimistic people are at WoD (an expansion i've thoroughly enjoyed, but that's because I'm a raider and HM and BRF are awesome raids).</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's easy to say that, the complexity and issues of doing that far outstrip any benefits to doing it.<br />
<br />
Outdoors is a shitty place for a theatrical experience like the ones that Blizzard does. <br />
<br />
Outdoors in Southern California is either hot, or raining, especially in November.<br />
<br />
Most sports venues don't want their multi-million dollar grass or astroturf torn up by 30,000 people trampling all over it for 2 days, and I'm sure Blizzard doesn't want to pay to replace it. The Metallica/Guns N' Roses tour lost money for that exact reason. <br />
<br />
Your costs rise exponentially - security, production, cleanup, etc. Blizzard most likely subsidizes a large part of the show, even with the high ticket prices. <br />
<br />
You're assuming any of the large arena's have two consecutive days available - and Blizzard can afford to book it. You just don't walk into the LA Forum and set up. <br />
<br />
You're assuming there's accommodations for more people. We're talking Orange County. They can handle conventions. They use the drop in traffic to hotels in the area because it's off season for Disney, to make sure there's hotel rooms for the convention goers. That's why you'll never see a Blizzcon at the height of tourist/Disney season. Hotel rooms are a hot commodity during tourist season, it's something you have to pay attention to in any big city, if you want your visitors to be able to sleep in a hotel room at night. <br />
<br />
And, any quality of their production is thrown right out the window. Glare from the sun in the daytime, noise from the freeway very close by, airplanes overhead, heat exhaustion, bugs, smog, it all adds up to a pretty crappy experience. They have people walking around in heavy, hot costumes - making them do that in direct sunlight means they need a large staff of EMTs for the eventual and guaranteed heat strokes and dehydration. There's a reason why events like this are held indoors, with controlled environment (heat/ac), and no expensive equipment exposed to the elements.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Magodelagua</div><div class="date">2015-03-13, 07:20 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">200 U$.... uff</div></div><hr />

<br />
Fire codes limit that - but it's also calculated on the flow of people in and out all day. Most conventions have people that show up, take an hour or two to look around, and then leave. Shows like car shows, the old MacWorld shows, or the music industry convention that's held at the same place Blizzcon is (NAMM) don't expect people to show up and stay all day. Blizzcon is a destination - you go, and stay all day, both days. That's going to limit how many people you can cycle in and out every day. <br />
<br />
http://www.anaheimconventioncenter.com/Article.aspx?id=42 shows the capacities of the halls. Note that you can't just add up the numbers and sell that many tickets, it's a bit more complicated than that, you have to account for the space taken up by booths, cordons, shops, concessions, backstage, staging, support areas like where the servers are, the TV production stuff, etc. <br />
<br />
30-40k is about right for a crowd that's not going to leave for two days. The only way they could expand is to go to a bigger convention center, like the LA Convention Center, but moving there would have it's own issues. E3 is held there, so they have experience with gaming shows, but parking and accommodations and cost are going to be an issue. <br />
<br />
Scaling events like this is vastly more complicated than most people think. I've been part of planning for corporate events at this scale, it can take a team of people a year or more to put a show as big as Blizzcon on. Doubling the size is a lot more work than you could ever know, unless you've done it. Every aspect changes with a doubling of attendees. (adding 10% more wouldn't be worth the time and effort, and your choices past the Anaheim Convention Center are extremely limited) I'm sure the team at Blizzard who does the show would love to get more people in to enjoy it, but have a budget that they have to consider, and the complications of moving the show further from their offices, dealing with downtown LA, and adding many layers of complexity, to an already complex issue. Blizzcon in Anaheim works, and if they could just throw money at it to sell more tickets, they would have done so. They could add more days, but that makes booking the center more complicated and expensive - but I'm surprised they haven't added a day by now.<br />
<br />
The one thing they haven't done, which surprises me, but in some ways doesn't, is to have an east coast show one year, a west coast the next, and have a EU show as well. Spread the ticket sales out regionally, make it easier for other regions to attend. Who knows, if they remain as profitable as they have been, and as popular, they may do that eventually.<br />
<br />

<br />
200 U$.... uff<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's steep...but do you expect Blizzard to pocket all the expenses? Do you know how much a show like Blizzcon costs? The insurance alone is probably enough to make you faint. <br />
<br />
Conventions generally work this way: the vendors pay for most of it. The big computer shows are paid for by those big pavilions by Microsoft, and HP, and Adobe. Every booth and table paid to be there, and that subsidizes your ticket price. The shows also have corporate sponsors.<br />
<br />
Blizzcon is ONE product. They have small vendors in the hall, but the main product being sold is Blizzard. Microsoft doesn't have a pavilion there, or HP, or Alienware, or Dell. <br />
<br />
$100 a day, to access the reveals, panels, demos, beta play, and tournaments, and the costume events, AND a B grade rock band? It's really not that bad, all things considered, and you get a goody bag. <br />
<br />
Compare this to Photoshop World, which I'm thinking about attending this year. $600 for a pass - $800 later on, close the actual event. Access to the vendors on the floor is free, but that's not why you go (It would be like Blizzard letting you into the shop at Blizzcon for free, but charging for the stage stuff and panels). Plus, more classes and workshops require more fees. Throw on top of that a plane ticket to Vegas, and a hotel room at the height of tourist season. I'm looking at a $2K trip, for 3 days - and that doesn't allow for gambling.<br />
<br />
$200? You can spend that easily in LA for a meal for 4 people.</div></div><hr />

Not true. The Pennsylvania Farm Show is the largest one in the world: 585,000 estimated to have attended last year's show, said spokeswoman Nicole Bucher.<br />

<br />
The Great American Outdoor show is also the largest outdoors show in the world:<br />
<br />
http://www.greatamericanoutdoorshow.org/ The 2014 Great American Outdoor Show saw about 200,000 people<br />
<br />
The Great American Outdoor Show is a nine day event celebrating hunting, fishing and outdoor traditions that are treasured by millions of Americans and their families. The show features over 1,000 exhibitors ranging from shooting manufacturers to outfitters to fishing boats and RV’s, and archery to art covering 650,000 square feet of exhibit hall space! Not to mention a jam packed schedule including country concerts, fundraising dinners, speaking events, archery competitions, celebrity appearances, seminars, demonstrations and much more! <br />

They do it there precisely because of their office location. Blizzcon is still largely planed by their staff. If they did it on the east, or even south in LA, it would make things more difficult to plan, not to mention costs of sending a large portion of thier staff to that location with accommodations. They also want their employees to be able to enjoy it, they run shuttles from campus all weekend. If they did it any where else, their employees would not be able to attend. To them, its just not practical to do any where else.<br />
<br />
also, i wouldn't call the bands they had the last 3 years B grade. FOO fighters? dave grohl is an amazing musician and puts on amazing shows, their tours easily sell out huge venues. Blink 182 is not as relevant today, but that's more to do with intra band issues and their on again off again touring etc. They still headline and sell out larger venues, and have their own successful side projects, they are perhaps the weakest of the last 3 years. Finally metallica, mother fucking metallica. They are far from irreverent, they still sell out, for high ticket prices, huge shows. Calling them B rate is like calling kiss, journey, AC/DC or Bon Jovi B rate just because they arn't putting out new music like they use to. They still draw huge crowds and demand high ticket prices. Metallica has their own multi day festival they headline. Last year it was in Detroit on Bell Isle, it took up the majority of an island park larger than central park in NYC (which despite what movies and TV may have you think, is huge)</div></div><hr />

They also want their employees to be able to enjoy it, they run shuttles from campus all weekend. If they did it any where else, their employees would not be able to attend. To them, its just not practical to do any where else.<br />
<br />
also, i wouldn't call the bands they had the last 3 years B grade. FOO fighters? dave grohl is an amazing musician and puts on amazing shows, their tours easily sell out huge venues. Blink 182 is not as relevant today, but that's more to do with intra band issues and their on again off again touring etc. They still headline and sell out larger venues, and have their own successful side projects, they are perhaps the weakest of the last 3 years. Finally metallica, mother fucking metallica. They are far from irreverent, they still sell out, for high ticket prices, huge shows. Calling them B rate is like calling kiss, journey, AC/DC or Bon Jovi B rate just because they arn't putting out new music like they use to. They still draw huge crowds and demand high ticket prices. Metallica has their own multi day festival they headline. Last year it was in Detroit on Bell Isle, it took up the majority of an island park larger than central park in NYC (which despite what movies and TV may have you think, is huge)<br />
<br />
Calm your tits, I forgot about Foo Fighters, I like them too. I tend to block out Metalllica, I'm beyond burnt out on them after seeing them in the clubs in SF.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I hope that they talk about patch 6.3 or patch 6.4 and not patch 6.2 god - living with patch 6.1 till november ... that would be insane.</div></div><hr />

To be fair, Blink 182 were huge a few years ago and are widely considered to be a big part of their genre. Several popular bands today such as Fall Out Boy and Paramore claim to be heavily inspired by their work too. It's true that they're past their prime though, but the impact they made was rather substantial.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree with you. With the movie coming out in March 2016 they will be starting to advertise it in November. The BlizzCon coming in November is the right time to launch the ads and hype for the movie.</div></div><hr />

agree completely. I didnt mean to imply that they are close a to a B grade, simply of the last 3, at this period of time, they are the weakest of them. They were all certainly major bands who can sell out huge venues on their own. Just Blink 182 has been doing more limited tours, and recently even broke up again (they had just gotten back together the prior year they played blizzcon) due to band issues.</div></div><hr />

There have been many people pointing out whats wrong and how to fix it within their respective games. Only the people blind to any wrongdoing on blizzards part refuse to see that and just say people are complaining for the sake of complaining. Also, if people DIDN'T complain NOTHING WOULD EVER FUCKING CHANGE!!!!<br />
<br />
Get your head out of blizzards ass.In this day and age, with the internet around, and all this information that is freely shared, you think things would be less confusing, and a lot clearer, but unfortunately, it makes it just as easy to say something completely UNTRUE, and put it forth as fact, and have many people believe it without ever thinking about the logic behind it.<br />
<br />
The following statement from the above post is not true, will never be true, and is 100% false: &quot;Also, if people DIDN'T complain NOTHING WOULD EVER FUCKING CHANGE!!!!&quot;<br />

I hope Blizzard hangs a huge banner over the doorway leading to the room where they talk about the new WoW expansion with the sentence &quot;Remember, we never said the words 'I promise'. Have a fun time at Blizzcon.&quot; That way when half the things that were talked about don't actually make it into the expansion no one is surprised and the internet can stop exploding.OR, they could just not give you a preview of the next expansion at all, until it is done. It's obvious that people complained so much about the preview they gave of WOD, that now they've backed off of previews for patches completely until the whole thing is on the ptr.<br />
<br />
And this goes right towards the point I was just making, which is... complaining isn't always helpful, sometimes it is the opposite.</div></div><hr />
