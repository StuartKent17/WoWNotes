It seems that the Dark Phoenix mount is fairly popular these days, here is a short video of how the model looks. As a reminder, the Dark Phoenix will be rewarded through the new Guild Achievement/Rewards system, you will have to unlock it via a Guild Achievement, have enough reputation with your guild to buy it, and of course, enough gold.

<br />
Archaeology Preview<br />
There isn't much known about Archaeology at this point but a couple of spells and some extra information have been added to the game files. Even if Path of the Titans is gone it looks like the main idea behind Archaeology remains the same and you will have to hunt for artifacts throughout the world. <br />
<br />
Rewards<br />
The only thing we know about Archaeology rewards is from the Press Tour 2 months ago, rewards are known to be &quot;cosmetic only&quot; like pets, or toys, but a few of them will have actual effects. We really don't know much more but a few people speculated that the Skeletal Raptor Mount (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/cataclysm/cataclysm_models/skeletalraptormount.jpg) and Skeletal Raptor Pet (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/cataclysm/cataclysm_models/skeletalraptorpet.jpg) might be Archaeology rewards. It would make sense, with the &quot;Fossil&quot; research branch in the game files. (But again, this is pure speculation at this point)<br />
<br />
<br />
Research Branch<br />
It seems that the profession includes multiple research branches: <br />
<br />
<br />
Dwarf<br />
Draenei<br />
Fossil<br />
Night Elf<br />
Nerubian<br />
Orc<br />
Tol'vir<br />
Troll<br />
Vrykul<br />
Other<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Research Sites<br />
The known research sites are: <br />
<br />
<br />
Stone Cairn Dig Site (Elwynn Forest)<br />
Ironband's Excavation Site (Loch Modan)<br />
Ironbeard's Tomb (Wetlands)<br />
Whelgar's Excavation Site (Wetlands)<br />
Greenwarden's Fossil Bank (Wetlands)<br />
Circle of Inner Binding (Arathi Highlands)<br />
Circle of West Binding (Arathi Highlands)<br />
Circle of East Binding (Arathi Highlands)<br />
Circle of Outer Binding (Arathi Highlands)<br />
Witherbark Dig Site (Arathi Highlands)<br />
Thandol Span (Arathi Highlands/Wetlands)<br />
Dun Garok Dig Site (Hillsbrad Foothills)<br />
Shindra'Alor Dig Site (Hinterlands)<br />
Altar of Zul Dig Site (Hinterlands)<br />
Jintha'Alor Lower City Dig Site (Hinterlands)<br />
Jintha'Alor Upper City Dig Site (Hinterlands)<br />
Agol'watha Dig Site (Hinterlands)<br />
<br />
<br />
It looks like only the Dwarf branch of archeology is implemented for the moment, and it's most likely not complete. <br />
<br />
<br />
Trainers<br />
Of course.<br />
<br />

These spells are part of the Archaeology profession. <br />

&lt;tr&gt;<br />
&lt;td class=&quot;tableHeader&quot; width=&quot;30&quot;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;<br />

&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr class=&quot;proftable1&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86866/&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;30&quot; src=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/static/img/icons/inv_misc_dice_02.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86866/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Bone Gaming Dice&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=#ff8020&gt; 30&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#808080&gt;100&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/td&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dwarves love gold and dwarves love drinking, so gaming seemed like a natural fit for both. These dice appear to have been carved from sheep bones.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr class=&quot;proftable2&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86864/&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;30&quot; src=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/static/img/icons/inv_misc_urn_01.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86864/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ceramic Funeral Urn&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=#ff8020&gt; 30&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#808080&gt;100&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/td&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some dwarves sealed their deceased in tombs. Clans that had more interaction with the Scourge tended to burn their dead.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr class=&quot;proftable1&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86857/&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;30&quot; src=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/static/img/icons/inv_misc_beer_01.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86857/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver Drinking Cup&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=#ff8020&gt; 30&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#808080&gt;100&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/td&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;If there's one thing dwarves love, it's drinking. And fighting. Two things.&lt;br&gt;This cup may have belonged to a minor noble or wealthy merchant. Any gems have long since been lost or stolen.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr class=&quot;proftable2&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/88181/&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;30&quot; src=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/static/img/icons/inv_jewelry_necklace_07.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/88181/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Silver Neck Torc&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=#ff8020&gt; 30&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#808080&gt;100&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/td&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dwarves are famous metalsmiths. While they produce many implements of war, they are adept at working with softer metals as well.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr class=&quot;proftable1&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/88180/&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;30&quot; src=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/static/img/icons/ability_mount_snowygryphon.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/88180/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Stone Gryphon&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=#ff8020&gt; 30&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#808080&gt;100&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/td&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gryphons have long been allies of the Wildhammer dwarves, who brought their noble steeds to the rest of the Alliance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr class=&quot;proftable2&quot;&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86865/&quot;&gt;&lt;img border=&quot;0&quot; width=&quot;30&quot; height=&quot;30&quot; src=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/static/img/icons/inv_sword_110.png&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/86865/&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Worn Hunting Knife&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;td align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=#ff8020&gt; 30&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=#808080&gt;100&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/td&gt;<br />
<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Some dwarves spend most of their lives underground, but others welcome a chance to step out into the sunlight to add a bit of meat to their diet.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />
&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr class=&quot;proftable1&quot;&gt;<br />

<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Allows an archaeologist to find artifact fragments and complete artifacts up to a maximum potential skill of 75.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/td&gt;<br />

&lt;/tr&gt;<br />

<br />
&lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Survey for archaeology fragments within a dig site. Each survey will direct you closer to the location of the fragments.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;40 yd range, 4 sec cooldown&lt;/td&gt;<br />

Holy Changes<br />
We removed the prereq chain from Divine Illumination to Aura Mastery and Light of Dawn. We had the prerq in there to make sure paladins didn't skip over a powerful group utility talent in a perhaps selfish attempt to enhance their personal healing per second, but we do acknowledge that it is far less useful in say 5-player dungeons.

I know you do too!:&gt;<br />
I did like the other pictures to, the warlock.. on what I still call their mount, ponyta.. looks pretty cool.<br />
The Tauren at the sunset is also awesome, I might even try to make a good desktop of that one when I come home.<br />
And, yeh.. I know the draenei is mostly what you say! But still;&gt;<br />
Yeah! And the little creatures on the last fan art pictures was VERY CUTE.</div></div><hr />

I do think that Blizzard have something for leggy Draenei Females though considering the last few batches of fan art they've put up :D<br />

<br />
It's sort of a mix between a night elf (outward pointing ears) and a human (traditional eyes), as well as having traits from both Draenei and Man'ari.<br />
<br />
Doesn't mean it's not smexy, but it is odd. :P<br />

The tauren ones are fantastic - especially the disney-esque on the right!<br />
<br />
The warlock shows why the Corrupter set is still the best looking and most recognisable set in the game - good luck ever topping that one since Blizzard long stopped putting that much effort into sets!<br />
<br />
I don't really like the blood elf one. The artwork is too anime without any justification for it. Previous pieces in that style have shown the participants in classic anime poses, especially group ones or clever use of pets etc.</div></div><hr />

Just pretend you're studying it as part of the context of whatever society made use of it (ancient trolls I guess). It's like paleoethnobotany, except with, ummm, animals.

Look how far the rib cage is extended from the back to the front of that picture. It's like the artist was drawing her front half (forward from the arms) from a reference picture of someone who was standing, and then did the arched back (behind the arms) from another reference. End result?<br />

It looks like she has an alien inside that's trying to break free.<br />

Ok, and it's supposed to be a secondary profession, so optional but with a few nice perks (like cooking has feasts, fishing has quite a few rare catches, but first-aid has nothing); I guess I'm just surprised there really isn't much ready for testing yet.</div></div><hr />

Well it does make sense, when you think about it. Since I imagine you have to level the skill upto 525.. like most skills, some of the time will be spent levelling it throughout Outland. Its blizzards way of making sure you still actually use some of the &quot;old&quot; areas of content. Its a nice addition and I like it. Imo it will be kinda neat to find some Draenei artifacts around the place, same goes for orc.<br />
<br />
I hoping theres an artifact, which we all can find.called &quot;Garrosh's Sense&quot; - Lost many many years ago.</div></div><hr />

At least that's not what the brainwashing media makes of it! Neither a tauren or draenei need a tail for balancing purposes, their walking is similar to that of humans and are most likely as good without one. Well at least they can wave it around when they are happy, liks dogs, that's one reasonable functionality.<br />

<br />
- You buy race/faction mounts from vendors seeming to hang around at their mount shop in capitals. Makes sense.<br />
- Rare giant beetle mount from doing stuff related to giant insect overlords. Makes sense too.<br />
- KT in tempest keep got a chance of dropping his pet phoenix as a mount. That's nice.<br />
- Fancy troll styled war-bear mount accessible by doing stuff in a troll raid instance. Awesome.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2010-08-19, 12:56 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let me explain how Archeology will work. First thing, remember there are training levels just like all professions ( 1-75, 75-150 etc).<br />
<br />
Each level range will have it's own set of artifacts, the fragments of those artifacts will only be found in certain level zones. Think of it as peacebloom only being found in very low level zones. So you will survey the sites, find a fragment, and build artifacts with the fragments. Surveying can be done at skill level 1, and when you get to skill level 30, you can actually begin combining the fragments into artifacts.<br />
<br />
Completing ALL the artifacts within a given subgrouping will unlock the reward.. so in the dwarf example, all 6 artifacts must be constructed (the necklace, dice etc)<br />
<br />
So the Dranai 'branch' listed above will be the fragments that can be found from skill level 300-375 in outlands. Those fragments will be put together to construct dranai artifacts. When all of the dranai artifacts are collected (6 of them), then the player will get a reward.<br />
<br />
The Vrykul will be the 'branch' found in Northrend.</div></div><hr />

Well they did have some lore explanations to the achievement mounts in WotLK. For example, when you complete Glory of the Ulduar Raider, you get a mail from Brann Bronzebeard describing how he and his men found a wounded proto-drake hatchling (probably a child of Razorscale) which they patched up, tamed, and then offered to you as a gift for your &quot;shenanigans in Ulduar&quot;.<br />
<br />

<br />
Not exactly. Remember that time in WOW is dealt with as the levels progress - so (currently) at L60, Baron Rivendare is ruling Stratholme, while at fresh 80, he's lording it up as leader of the 4h (as an example).<br />
<br />
So Harrison is in Zul'Aman at 70, where he gets beaten down but escapes (and where Budd Nedreck gets infected with the essence of Zul'jin). 10 levels (and 2 years) later, he's in Grizzly Hills (as is Budd). Two years after that, he's teaching archaeology in Stormwind, while occasionally jetting off to Uldawhatsit to find ancient arties and fight naz... uh... cultists.</div></div><hr />

Tbh, shrinking her rib-cage and enlarging her breasts just makes her head look big. She's also twisting in an awkward way (she's bent more towards us in your pic, yet her shoulder has moved further back?)<br />
<br />
The only issue the first picture really had is that the waist was WAYYY too thin compared to the size of everything else. It's like she's missing her abdomen.<br />
<br />
Yeah, squatting like that makes it look like she's shitting and/or dancing on an invisible pole, but it's not impossible for a female to squat as such without help.<br />
<br />
The rest of the issues are lore issues, not anatomy issues. Draenei tails are thicker, their ears aren't so huge, their skin isn't that of a Man'ari, and their eyes are suppose to glow. Non of these these things change whether or not she looks female though.<br />
<br />
Edit: I don't have photoshop, but I can still point out the problem.<br />
<br />
http://i35.tinypic.com/29fsavs.jpg<br />
<br />
There's no reason for her rib cage to be hollowed out as such. The abdomen attaches to both the front and bottom edge of the ribs and sternum (http://www.getbodysmart.com/ap/muscularsystem/abdominalmuscles/rectusabdominis/tutorial.html). The whole stomach/belly area shouldn't be so concave.<br />
<br />
The rest seems fine though.</div></div><hr />

I'm sure we'll see a lot more interesting gold sinks in Cataclysm :)</div></div><hr />

Almost all mounts seem to come out of nowhere. And cataclysm seems to continue in the same way... Exactly what is this Dark Phoenix related to lorewise/in-game?<br />
<br />
Where were you the whole of WotLK???<br />
<br />
Almost every mount I can think of had a legitimate story behind obtaining it, wether this was via assumed knowledge of the lore, or via an accompanying letter in the mail.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ganimah</div><div class="date">2010-08-20, 01:18 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Ok...so...now it is official. I will not be buying Cataclysm. Guild Talents = Nerfed. Archaeology = Just another list of achievements but with more grinding. Mastery = Old talents. New Talent Trees = less choice/less interesting. People keep thinking that they are going to revise things more, but I think they are fairly close to where they think they want to be. This is a serious disappointment for me and a major step backwards. Pig with lipstick. There's nothing new. And don't tell me the graphics being updated to 3D models in the Old universe with new streams of lava is really all that new.<br />

It would make sense, with the &quot;Fossil&quot; research branch in the game files. (But again, this is pure speculation at this point)<br />
Actually, this was outright confirmed. One of the things they confirmed at the second Blizzard HQ press tour was that a skeletal raptor mount would be one of the rewards for Archaeology.</div></div><hr />

It's almost like she's overweight, but you can tell that wasn't the intention. Maybe just a bad angle on the armor, not sure. Good art anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's sort of a mix between a night elf (outward pointing ears) and a human (traditional eyes), as well as having traits from both Draenei and Man'ari.<br />
<br />
Doesn't mean it's not smexy, but it is odd. :P<br />
<br />
The Chibi troll characters are pretty cute. :3<br />
<br />
The tauren are badass looking. :)<br />
<br />
The warlock mount doesn't really seem demonic enough, but still cool non-the-less. B)<br />
<br />
Harrison Jones with his monocle is also awesome. :D<br />
<br />
That female draenei mostly looks like a regular human female with horns stuck on top and a tail. It doesn't -feel- like a draenei at all to me :(<br />
<br />
Also, upon closer inspection.. Janric Moller in the Harrison screenshot. http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/august/harrisonarch.jpg<br />
Is it just me, or is he actually wearing a new shirt/chest model there? The cloth sticks out at the bottom, like an actual shirt. Perhaps this means that after new leg and boot models, Blizzard will now bring improved chestpiece MODELS in Cataclysm?</div></div><hr />

I think I got all the shitty protodrakes available (except the ironbound one, stopped raiding before getting it because it was too pointless).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Almost every mount I can think of had a legitimate story behind obtaining it, wether this was via assumed knowledge of the lore, or via an accompanying letter in the mail.<br />
<br />
A short in-game mail isn't what I would call a legitimate story. Truth is that the protodrake is a standard model they developed for northrend dragons... Their artists made a handful of different textures, and then put all the differently textured protodrakes down into a big bag. As WOTLK progressed, every time they thought someone deserved something special they grabbed a protodrake from the bag.<br />
<br />
It seems very, very tagged on.<br />
<br />
Compare it with the classic/TBC mounts I mentioned. They're unique while related directly to the &quot;plot&quot;.</div></div><hr />
