Patch 7.2 Content Release Timeline<br />
We’ve seen some confusion around the availability and timing of various aspects of the 7.2 patch, and we’d like to clarify our plans for releasing the remaining pieces of Patch 7.2’s content:<br />
<br />
<br />
Week 2 (next week): Legion Assaults begin, first PvP Brawl becomes available Week 3: Chapter 5 of the Class Order Hall campaign unlocks, which activates new followers, new Order Hall upgrades, and class-specific World Quests Week 4+: Ongoing story pieces unlock, leading up to the eventual opening of the Tomb of Sargeras raid, and the ability to earn Class Mounts<br />
<br />
Several of these pieces tie into the overarching story being told in 7.2: our return to the Broken Shore for vengeance, followed by the Legion’s response, and the eventual buildup toward the assault on the Tomb of Sargeras and Kil’jaeden himself. With the release of Patch 7.2, that series of events is set into motion, but they don’t all occur immediately. For example, the upcoming Legion Assaults are a direct response to our initial attack on the Broken Shore. Those assaults, in turn, prompt some of the later parts of the Order Hall campaign. These events occur in a chronological order, and we want to give players the chance to be there as it happens, rather than having some of it unfold off-screen or rushing it along.<br />
<br />
But aside from the narrative, pacing content releases helps with clear direction and player focus. During PTR testing, where we had the calendar advanced to allow for testing of all content in parallel, players were pulled in many different directions from the outset. While the heart of the patch lies on the Broken Shore, Legion Assaults were drawing players back to the original Broken Isles zones, and many Order Campaign questlines sent players to other expansions’ continents. With the content release structure we settled on, Broken Shore can stand alone as the initial focus of attention. We didn’t open the Tomb of Sargeras raid with the patch because we don’t want to rush players who are still progressing through Nighthold, but that same sort of logic applies to nearly all other features.<br />
<br />
We apologize that that hasn’t been clear enough from the start, but hope that this will help relieve some concerns.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It says 4+ weeks, &quot;eventually leading up to the Tomb of...., they have said in several places that this campaign will take weeks and that nighthold will be the raid for a while longer. I wouldn't expect Tomb to release until mid May at the earliest.</div></div><hr />

June 23 - New Raid: Hellfire Citadel opens with Normal and Heroic difficulties available.<br />
3.0 FF14: Heavensward June 23, 2015<br />

Strong chance they'll want to put something out the same time the expansion hits, i'm expecting the 14th just prior to the release<br />
That's also after 11weeks from patch day, which we're supposedly getting an 11week quest chain that will lead up to breaching the tomb.<br />

<br />
Actually i'm assuming Blizzard does when looking that they released HFC the day FF14's second expansion was released, as well as we've been given an 11week quest chain leading up to breaching the Tomb which from patch day will finish making week 12 14/06 6 days prior to the release of FF14's 3rd expansion.<br />
<br />
hence my assumption it will release either 14/06 or 21/06.</div></div><hr />

But, I completely get &amp; share the sentiments of many others with the open world content. It felt awfully weird to have nothing left an hour into a new patch aside from grinding mobs for nethershards. Especially when nothing actually tells me that's a good idea. I only know that's a thing because of outside sources. There isn't even an incompleted quest in my log indicating I should go back to Broken shore tonight. I just know I should go do the WQ for rep even though nothing currently tells me that rep goal exists aside from an achievement.</div></div><hr />

The Tomb of Sargeras raid is at least a couple months away, and we will be revealing more information on that as it gets closer to release.</div></div><hr />

<br />
hence my assumption it will release either 14/06 or 21/06.It's not unheard of for Blizzard to time new content to land around the time new content in other big MMOs hits. 7.2 released the same day the last big story patch for Heavensward hit, and Tomb of Sargeras will likely open in early June to coincide with FFXIV: Stormblood launch. Back in the day they timed content releases to steal thunder from SWTOR and RIFT, too. Anyone who denies that at this point is being willfully ignorant. That being said, they're aping what is arguably FFXIV's strongest point: the three-month patch cycle that provides steady story updates and new dungeon content, which is only a good thing IMO.<br />
<br />
FFXIV isn't going to pull anywhere near WoW numbers (again, anyone who expects that sort of lightning-in-a-bottle success to repeat without a huge design shift in the MMO genre is being willfully ignorant), but it's still steady competition for WoW considering it has a stable playerbase and a dedicated team. That's something to be celebrated because it keeps both teams on their toes.</div></div><hr />

Is that the only two options? Month of gating or a couple days worth of shit to do? How about they just add some extra shit to do? They just tuned a brand new raid, maybe add that to the fucking mix. It would have been smooth it they didn't gate nighthold for so long. Gating gone wrong.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If they launch a new 13 boss raid every seven weeks they will run out of content so fast and we'll be right back to the MoP/WoD situation of a year long wait between expansions.<br />
<br />
How about you have a bit of patience, recognise that the game is stronger for having story content leading up to a raid that was never supposed to release with this patch and chill the fuck out? Chances are high they aren't even done with ToS yet.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nonsense, Nighthold release was at a decent time. Much earlier and it would've been too early. Similarly, releasing Tomb right now would be too early.<br />
We don't need a full raid tier every 2 months, that would be too fast.</div></div><hr />

I'd rather they held off on releasing the patch another week or 2 and have it be more than just an island with nothing to do on it.<br />

So you're saying that during those 8+ months, there's been nothing else released? And you're done with the raids (above LFR difficulty) and everything else?<br />
<br />
Ain't no &quot;apologizing&quot; going on, Blizzard said they wanted better pacing so as to not frontload an expansion and then leaving it dry for over a year. The fact that people like you are now bitching about them not doing exactly that, is beyond sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nothing to apologise for this time - well apart from the mob scaling thing which they should have announced.<br />
<br />
Gated content is whinged about, but if it isn't gated then people whinge about being forced to grind, then whinge about running out of content.<br />
<br />
Blizzard is just doing the right thing by the majority... who cares what a few hundred whingers think about it.<br />

That's also after 11weeks from patch day, which we're supposedly getting an 11week quest chain that will lead up to breaching the tomb.<br />

<br />
<br />
As stated in the post.<br />
The day FF14 released their first expansion, blizzard released 6.2 &amp; the HFC raid.<br />
<br />
Also we're doing an 11week long story quest chain leading upto the breaching of tomb. The following reset post this will be 14/06 which is 6days prior to the release of FF14's next expansion.<br />
<br />
Blizzard lining up content to coincide with competitors is nothing new, they did this alongside SWOTR as well as Wildstar.<br />
<br />
This is what leads me to believe they &quot;give two shits&quot; to estimate a release date for the raid itself.</div></div><hr />

This seems like a bit too much timegating to keep a false sense of steady content stream.<br />
<br />
Nighthold as only been out for a little over 2 months. That + ~3 months would be around 6 months, which is the traditional gap between raids. This is not a &quot;Warlords&quot; mistake, this is standard. The problem with Warlords was lack of content, and on top of that, relevant content. This is not a problem for Legion.</div></div><hr />

Timeless Isle and Tanaan Jungle was final patch zones. Argus is the final patch zone for Legion. Broken Shore should be compared to something like the ToC daily area and Isle of Thunder. The ToC daily area is a bit of a haze for me because it was a pretty long time ago, but the Isle of Thunder I do remember. It started off small when you first landed, with only a few dailies available. Over time, as people on your server did dailies, it contributed to the efforts, and every few weeks, the story would expand and you get more dailies and more content. They are actually very similar in how they function.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Are you insinuating a patch zone is allowed to be poorly designed if it isn't the final patch? :confused: I have no problem with time-gating as a general thing. What I am annoyed at is they put basic zone features behind a time-wall so the zone is practically empty. It's fine if it opens up more as time goes on, not so much when it starts with nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I never stated that I agreed with the idea that it was poorly designed, I was just making the point that mid-expansion zones and end-expansion zones have always been done differently. Out of all of the mid-expansion zones (ToC, Firelands, ToT, ToS), you weren't meant to be there for hours. The only real difference is that this one is the first to not launch with a raid. I feel that this is the main issue for most people, which I can understand. It doesn't feel like what those other patches felt like when they came out. <br />
<br />
If anything, I would say that was Blizzard's biggest fault. They gave people a certain expectation, but what they got was a bit different. People thought all of the content would be here on release day, and they were disappointed when they realized it was all gone in no time. If somebody had come out before the patch hit, explaining that their plan was for a gradual release of content in this patch, I don't think it would have been received so poorly.<br />
<br />
Think about it like this: no one (prior to the patch hitting the Background Downloader) expected 7.2 to hit so soon. If the patch had come out a month from now with all it's content, I don't think most people would be complaining that it took too long to release. But instead of that, they are releasing the content over 4 weeks, starting on this week. This lead to disappointment and all of the backlash on the forums.<br />
<br />
So no, I don't think 7.2 is poorly designed, just that they communicated poorly, which is unfortunately very common.</div></div><hr />

i dont get how this is different then icc coming out X months after Toc<br />
again its not like &quot;we are getting the raid late&quot; the raid is coming out exactly when it should<br />
we are just getting the other content early...<br />
imagine if icc launched with just the world content then dungeons then the raid opened over... a... few.. wait a minute...<br />

why do you compare expansion ending zones to mid expansion zones? you should compare broken shore to the isle of thunder or the molten front... but wait then you wouldent have a point to cry about... because both of those locations are some of peoples favorite content areas</div></div><hr />

<br />
Like I said in my earlier posts: historically, mid-expansion zones and end-expansion zones have been made with different intents and philosophies. Mid-expansion zones have always started small and start to grow overtime, and you aren't expected to have to spend a long time to finish everything.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But it does feel like it makes the initial Patch Day content a little slim. My advise would have been to unleash the invasions too, at least.<br />
<br />
Or have a follow-up quest like &quot;Await word from Khadgar as the siege progresses&quot; to let people know further content is on the way.<br />
<br />
I mean, I love the current release plan. But I am worried some people will buy subscription, check out the content today, and conclude there's not enough to keep them interested. Which isn't a good thing if we want to keep the game flourishing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Im honestly curious, why should this matter?<br />
If you are seriously subbing for this kind of content, then what is the purpose? The gameplay is quickly overwith, and yes you can grind, but to what end?<br />
<br />
I can understand raiding. Community, teamwork, challenge and progression with a goal.<br />
I can even understand collectors and achievement **** who just sets a goal and strives to reach it.<br />
<br />
<br />
But i cant for the love of god understand someone that subs/unsubs for a few days of real content. There are better games for such kind of gaming by far. Wow is made for the long-term relationship, you cant sub for a week, you sub for at least a month.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard have a habit of releasing new content to coincide with other games release. The most blatent example was the release of WotLK the day that WAR's free month ended, but you'll find plenty of other examples.<br />
<br />
The effect is simple. Those people floating between games just float to WoW. And it keeps other games on the backfoot with players never really getting much a foothold with more ambivalent ex-WoW players ...<br />

Yeah .... I agree. I wouldn't put it past them to coincide ToS and FF14 4.0.</div></div><hr />

except they do, because some things are made to last you till the next expansion comes out, well one is just a few months till the next patch.<br />

also by your logic we can compare a patch like 7.1.5 to 7.2 because &quot;the time of a piece of content releases&quot;<br />

<br />
We can't compare 7.1.5's new zone to 7.2's new zone because 7.1.5 didn't have a new zone. You are comparing patches, when it is more pertinent to compare zones that came in patches. In any case, comparisons are moot. Broken Shore, at launch, is a bad zone. I would like it if all patch zones at least attempted to compel me to stay in them for more than ~10 minutes a day. Other patch zones did this, if only due to what you had to do to make forward progress. The Broken Shore does not do this. <br />
<br />
It didn't have to be this way, because the repeatable meat of the zone exists. The meat of exploring and becoming acquainted with a new zone, rares, treasures, standard zone features at this point. Putting it behind a time-wall is unnecessary and makes the zone feel like just a bunch of mob spawns in comparison to every other zone in the last two expansions. It leaves a very bad first impression, for no good reason.</div></div><hr />

I'm already mostly done with 7.2 beyond Rep grinding. When the rest of this 'content' comes out I'll probably be done with it in half an hour and then have nothing to do until they release the next batch.</div></div><hr />

Even the release of ToS in two months could be way to soon for the average progress oriented mythic raider. We are at 5/10 at the moment and it would be an absolute fail if ToS would be released anytime soon.<br />

Judging from this;<br />
<br />
Strong chance they'll want to put something out the same time the expansion hits, i'm expecting the 14th just prior to the release<br />
That's also after 11weeks from patch day, which we're supposedly getting an 11week quest chain that will lead up to breaching the tomb.<br />
<br />
Although I wouldn't be surprised to see 7.2.5 release 14/06/17 with Tomb the following week of 21/06/17<br />
<br />
The is probably correct. Blizzard have said that the 7.2 class campaign is 11 weeks long. Assuming April 11th is week 1 by that metric, week 11 would start June 20th. That sure is one heck of a coincidence, huh? xD</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since you can neither have even started anything on the Broken Shore beyond the initial landing quests and done some rep grinding/shard grinding - or - at most done the new dungeon a few times, no, you are not &quot;mostly done&quot;.<br />
<br />
Unless you mean it bores you, in which case why are you complaining? Go play something else.<br />
<br />
The content is set on a time release. It does a few things;<br />
<br />
- Keeps people from burning through the content on day one then bitching about how there is no content.<br />
- Makes the game world feel more alive by having a storyline unfold over the course of several weeks rather than everything in a day. <br />
<br />
Now, if long form storytelling isn't your thing? That can't be helped. Instant gratification is a pita because once you get it, it's gone. No work-up, no real sense of reward because you put no effort of time into it.<br />
<br />
Again, for people like this, there are many options out there; yoga, various brain stimulation games that work on your concentration, perhaps some muscle relaxants to relieve some of the stress that you get in the spot between your neck and your shoulders when the game is not going well (You know what I mean!). <br />
<br />
I hope that these ideas may help you and many others who are like you and can only rush and see negativity in a game they clearly love, but have developed a pseudo desire to decry it.<br />
<br />
<br />
For Me? I am happy to play the game and enjoy it for what it actually is; a game that has updated fairly consistently over it's history and provided me with more than enough entertainment for the token fee it requires.</div></div><hr />

If they're going to get something then gate it behind player dedication and make it so that such dedication. Not purposely time locking it.<br />
<br />
As it is there's nothing for me to do on the broken shore right now. World quests take 15 minutes and I've done all the questlines and the dungeon.<br />
<br />
If they reward players with new story content every 1500 Rep or something and make said Rep gainable at anytime without having to wait for world quest respawns then things would be much better paced to prevent burnout without leaving people as bored.</div></div><hr />

It would have been smooth it they didn't gate nighthold for so long. Gating gone wrong.<br />
<br />
For the average warcraft forum asshole, fuck yes it's the only set of options. You're going to either wait out the content at a gated pace and bitch quietly, or blow through the shit in a day because you have no fucking self control and then bitch loudly, but also while shitting yourself. Blizzard is simply selecting the lesser of two enormous fucking annoyances. If you just keep spam-adding shit just to add shit, it's going to be even lower quality and nobody is going to want to do it.<br />
<br />
After nearly a decade and a half I'd be pretty sick of people bitching because they don't understand &quot;You don't have to do everything in a week&quot; and are constantly ahead of the bulk of the playerbase, I'd just be gating it off too. The people complaining here are obviously not quitting anytime soon, why pander to them?</div></div><hr />

Putting rares and treasures and events, something we've come to expect from a patch zone, behind a time wall doesn't even seem like a good idea on paper.<br />
<br />
All of the side-quests and extra &quot;stuff to do&quot; budget was spent on Mythic, clearly. They expect you to be farming mythic, waiting for this new stuff to unlock.</div></div><hr />

So it's a three month wait for the new raid? I'm glad I'm coming back after not playing for like four months, so I have plenty to be doing. I feel bad for people who have been playing consistently. This seems like a bit too much timegating to keep a false sense of steady content stream.<br />
<br />
Nah, don't feel bad for all of us. I like alts, have 7 at 110 - there is plenty to do....in fact so much, that now I am struglling to catch up with all of them AND level my remaining 5 alts.<br />
<br />
But sure - if you only play one character, this might suck.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is the part where the problem lies. The current team is entirely too focused on managing every aspect and step the player takes in the game. They're micromanaging the player experience, and it's not surprising people are rebelling against it. It's hilarious Ion used the word &quot;organic&quot; to describe how players were supposed to discover mob ilevel scaling, and then drops a patch that is so inorganic it's hilarious. They're so terrified of the player seeing a single part of the narrative out of order, or not seeing it, they're putting the entire patch content on rails - and anything on rails in an open world context sucks. <br />
<br />
I don't recall the issues they're addressing here being a problem with the game. There was a failure of narrative in TBC, which Metzen admitted was their fault, but since then, there has been no overwhelming, blatant outcry for the need for devs micromanaging player focus, at all. It's stifling, is what it is, and if they keep going down this road, they'll lose a steady stream of players. (More than they are already) <br />
<br />
I think it's time for team 3, for Wow. Team 2 is too anal retentive and stubbornly so. They're suffocating the player in restrictions, and trying to dictate too much of the player experience. (That there's a lawyer in charge of development is not shocking, looking at this...)</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a invalid argument. Mythic raiding is only consumed by the vast, VAST minority of the player base. For 95+% of the player-base mythic raiding is NOT content. It is not something they do or ever would be able to do in current content. There has to be enough content for the 95+%.</div></div><hr />
