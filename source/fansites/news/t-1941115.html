Been wondering this for a while Purpleform =/= Shadowform. <br />
Shadowform's visual in the alpha is not complete - we are still working on it. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/690246747268841473))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Fel was called the language of chaos and chaotic energy. In what sense is fel chaotic? Is it chaotic in the sense that it leaves creatures infused with it in a state less orderly? Is it chaotic in the sense that fel energies moves chaotically, lashing out? Perhaps both?<br />
perhaps both, if titans speak the language of order, and Sargeras is the great unmaker, he seeks disorder/entropy, his magic too (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/690057673451126787))<br />
<br />
How exactly can Gul'dan and friends summon Sargeras? The Burning Legion had Archimonde, Hakkar, Xavius, and many Highborne struggling to summon Sargeras even though they had the Demon Soul, the OP Well of Eternity, and 3 Old Gods helping them. Seems kinda unrealistic that Sargeras can actually be summoned now. In no way can a portal exist that is big enough to allow Sargeras entry.<br />
Sargeras has tried to invade Azeroth many times. Gul'dan is building on previous work. Re:Tomb of Sergeras (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/690304315727032320))<br />
<br />
RE: the mogu. do you think that now Lei Shen is dead and Ra-Den is lurking about, that they would return to his side and try to &quot;serve&quot; him once more? maybe he could teach them how to you know, not be assholes to everybody else.<br />
Hard to say - they're no longer stone automatons. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/690304476083683328))<br />

Seems like making up 30+ unique quest lines turned up to be a bit tiring so Blizz decided to do a little trick there. =)</div></div><hr />

You're wrong. When there's people who level up their alts now and want to get capped you stand against a massive cap of conquest to catch up. For me with 4 toons I pvp with, I welcome this really.</div></div><hr />

Yes, fuck you, Kossak. This story could be the Elemental artifact one, but noooo... They gave us Chen, Pandaria and hots references. So creative.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Frankly, for people that are actively pvping they are already riding the cap. This change has really no effect on them whatsoever.<br />
<br />
This just lowers the barrier a bit for alts or newer players trying to get into the scene.<br />
<br />
<br />
I haven't been playing close attention to Priests so I'm probably a bit slow, but I'd be irked if the current Shadowform visual is removed, or if the glyph that allows mounts and pets to enter Shadowform disappears. My priest is just an alt and I'd probably stop playing that character altogether if the visuals are changed, it's too iconic.<br />
<br />
I doubt they will, the backlash would be pretty huge. I hope they're just tinkering with it a little bit so it has some better animations or something.</div></div><hr />
