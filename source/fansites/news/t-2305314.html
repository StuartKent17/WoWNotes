Celebrate Pirate's Day - September 19<br />
Pirate's Day begins is almost here and it brings some updates (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/6565-Patch-7-2-5-Pirate-s-Day-Tweets-Poll-Legion-Flying-HeroStorm) this year!<br />
<br />
<br />
Check out the little beach party just south of Booty Bay!<br />
The Jolly Roger (http://www.wowdb.com/items/150547-jolly-roger) toy is new this year! It is purchasable from Edward Techt (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/122396-edward-techt) for those that have completed Avast Ye, Admiral! (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/4621-avast-ye-admiral).<br />
<br />
Note: This toy potentially only requires completion of (Friendly) instead of Exalted.<br />
<br />
You can purchase Big Bag of Booty (http://www.wowdb.com/items/116392-big-bag-of-booty) from Dread Captain DeMeza (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/28048-dread-captain-demeza) to transfer gold between servers with a 5% loss. <br />
Kill Ol' Eary (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/108715-ol-eary) to get the Slightly-Chewed Insult Book (http://www.wowdb.com/items/138415-slightly-chewed-insult-book) toy.<br />
Completing You're Gonna Need A Bigger Boat! (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/42758-youre-gonna-need-a-bigger-boat) rewards Emergency Pirate Outfit (http://www.wowdb.com/items/138414-emergency-pirate-outfit)<br />
Drink with Dread Captain DeMeza (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/28048-dread-captain-demeza) to earn The Captain's Booty (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/3457-the-captains-booty)<br />
<br />
<br />
It’s Pirate’s Day! Celebrate all things piratical in Booty Bay! <br />
<br />
A Pirate’s Life for You<br />
Captain DeMeza has made landfall in the goblin town of Booty Bay to recruit landlubbers into her buccaneer ranks. Visit her or her henchmen in the capital cities if the pirate’s life is for you!<br />
<br />
Feeling out of place in Booty Bay without a proper costume? Don’t worry. /Dance one little jig with the Dread Captain DeMeza and she’ll be impressed enough to press you into her crew and outfit you properly. If you get attached to your new look, you can do the quest You’re Gonna Need a Bigger Boat (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/42758-youre-gonna-need-a-bigger-boat)! Succeed, and you’ll get an Emergency Pirate Outfit (http://www.wowdb.com/items/138414-emergency-pirate-outfit) (or five) for when Pirate’s Day is but a distant memory and your inner pirate is clawing to get out.<br />
<br />
What good is a pirate without an avian companion on their shoulder? Captain DeMeza (for the exchange of a few shiny coins) can help you call forth a temporary companion named Petey to take with you wherever you sail.<br />
<br />
From time to time, the captain will shout for a brave party to take on a terror of the deep—an elite shark known as Ol’Eary (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/108715-ol-eary). Make sure you have a hearty crew with you or you could become just so much chum in the waters of the bay.<br />
<br />
Join the Beach Party<br />
Once you and your crew have helped the captain handle Ol’Eary, you can celebrate with the crew at a little beach party* just south of Booty Bay. The exalted among the Bloodsail Buccaneers can also purchase a special new toy from Edward Techt—the Jolly Roger—to show off their dedication to the cause.<br />
<br />

<br />
If you’re really feeling generous, you can also purchase a Big Bag of Booty from Captain DeMeza and spread the wealth around to all your pirate pals in a burst of glittery glory.<br />
<br />
Note: Pirate beach parties do not involve beach blanket bingo, polka dot bikinis, wild bikinis, hipsters, preppies, motorcycle gangs, people named “Annette” or “Frankie,” or impromptu dance-offs between surfers and motorheads. It’s just for pirates. You have been warned.</div></div><hr />

Not sure which one triggers it as the guy had Honored and Edward says &quot;Admiral &lt;Name&gt;&quot; come over here. If anyone wants to further test it please go ahead. I'm hated with them, but have the title and &quot;Honored&quot; trigger so when he comes up in NA I'll test it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't need to be exalted nor have any rep with the Bloodsail Buccaneers currently. You can be unfriendly/hated, etc as long as you have gotten the title &quot;Bloodsail Admiral&quot; which you get from Avast Ye, Admiral! (http://www.wowdb.com/quests/4621-avast-ye-admiral) which also gives you a hat.</div></div><hr />

&quot;You can purchase Big Bag of Booty from Dread Captain DeMeza to transfer gold between servers with a 5% loss.&quot; - I can't send it to another realm...</div></div><hr />

You need to drop so character from another server can pick up gold<br />
Best way to do in garrison otherwise ppl will steal</div></div><hr />

Okay, thank you. I will try it, but my other char is not only on another realm but also on the opposite fraction :/</div></div><hr />

<br />
It should still work, just pick a remote location on Draenor or in Northrend to meet and you should be safe to transfer.</div></div><hr />
