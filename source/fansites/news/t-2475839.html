<br />
We’re excited to announce that the official Blizzard websites are now fully localized for murloc players everywhere. One benefit of countless failed attempts at establishing peaceful relations with various murloc tribes is that we have finally unlocked the secrets of Nerglish syntax and grammar. Thanks to this breakthrough in human-to-murloc communication, murlocs everywhere will now be able to engage with their human counterparts on equal footing.<br />
<br />
Murlocs: simply install the Nerglish Translator bookmarklet and get ready to surf our sites in your native tongue!<br />
<br />
HOW TO INSTALL<br />
<br />
Option 1—drag and drop the translator link below onto your browser’s bookmarks bar<br />
Option 2—manual Installation:<br />
<br />
Copy the translator link’s code to your clipboard<br />
Open your browser’s bookmark manager<br />
Create a new bookmark and paste the link’s code into the bookmark’s URL field<br />
That’s it! Now you can use this bookmarklet to translate any Blizzard page into Nerglish. In the hallowed and inspiring words of Morgl, “MRRRGGK!”<br />
<br />
<br />

Even if they aren't and humor is subjective, the comments complaining and the people making them come off as just plain miserable in their lives. You lot are literally complaining about a day celebrating mirth and jokes, and you especially called for the day to die so I dunno what's going on but I hope you find some laughter in your life.</div></div><hr />

If they were to delete the source file (https://assets.webn.mobi/nerglish/nerglish.js), you could just download it now and upload it somewhere else, change the link in the bookmark script to that place, and have it work forever. It's a fairly basic Javascript function that the bookmark adds to whatever page you're reading and executes.</div></div><hr />
