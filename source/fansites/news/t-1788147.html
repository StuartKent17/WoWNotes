Flying Feedback<br />
I have read all of your tweets, and will continue to. Thank you very much for the outpouring of feedback. (Muffinus (https://twitter.com/Muffinus/status/602502120470925312))<br />
<br />
It's a holiday weekend here so there won't be an immediate response, but please know you aren't being ignored. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/602516764321284096))<br />
Reading everything. Even the harsh things. Especially the harsh things. I understand you just want to keep enjoying a game you love. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/602517122829426689))<br />
<br />
Even now, I'm wasting words when the decision was made long ago and won't ever change to introduce flying.<br />
I'm curious - why do you assume the decision was made long ago? I'm sorry you think we've just been lying all this time. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/602525145169850369))<br />
<br />
you realize most of the post has turned into just flaming you guys because months of real feedback was ignored right?<br />
There is a massive difference between &quot;ignored&quot; and &quot;disagreed with.&quot; (CM_Lore (https://twitter.com/CM_Lore/status/602271343850184704))<br />

Patch 6.2 - Archimonde Preview<br />
Today we are taking a look at Archimonde, the final Hellfire Citadel boss. He drops three cloth items which look like his gear and can be used for transmog: Demon Prince's Ascendant Crown (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124159-demon-princes-ascendant-crown), Mantle of the Eredar Lord (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124176-mantle-of-the-eredar-lord) and Demonbuckle Sash of Argus (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124200-demonbuckle-sash-of-argus). He also drops trinkets for each class with spec specific effects (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/armor/trinkets?filter-patch=19890&amp;filter-agility-val=0&amp;filter-agility-op=3&amp;filter-stamina-val=0&amp;filter-stamina-op=3&amp;filter-versatility-val=0&amp;filter-versatility-op=3&amp;filter-spirit-val=0&amp;filter-spirit-op=3&amp;filter-crit-val=0&amp;filter-crit-op=3&amp;filter-intellect-val=0&amp;filter-intellect-op=3&amp;filter-strength-val=0&amp;filter-strength-op=3&amp;filter-mastery-val=0&amp;filter-mastery-op=3&amp;filter-bonus-armor-val=0&amp;filter-bonus-armor-op=3&amp;filter-ilvl-min=705&amp;filter-ilvl-max=705).<br />

<br />
One of the original eredar who betrayed the draenei of Argus to take his place as the sinister hand of the dark titan Sargeras, Archimonde the Defiler commands the military might of the Burning Legion. He arrives in Draenor, reaching across space and time, to ensure that the invasion of Azeroth proceeds as planned, and that Gul'dan does not fail his Legion masters.<br />
<br />
<br />
Overview - Archimonde assaults players with the might of the Burning Legion, gaining new abilities each time his health is reduced by 15%, eventually summoning &lt;a href=&quot;http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/182225-rain-of-chaos&quot;&gt;Rain of Chaos&lt;/a&gt; to destroy Draenor. When a player is launched into the air by &lt;a href=&quot;http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/183817-shadow-burst&quot;&gt;Fel Burst&lt;/a&gt;, their allies must catch them to avoid fatal damage. As Archimonde &lt;a href=&quot;http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/185590-desecrate&quot;&gt;Desecrates&lt;/a&gt; the land, players must protect themselves with the &lt;a href=&quot;http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/183943-light-of-the-naaru&quot;&gt;Light of the Naaru&lt;/a&gt;. When Archimonde reaches 40% health remaining, he begins to cast &lt;a href=&quot;http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/186961-nether-banish&quot;&gt;Nether Banish&lt;/a&gt;, sending players to the Twisting Nether.<br />

Patch 6.2 - Class Balancing<br />
We have not yet done a final numerical class/spec balance pass. Many of initial changes in the first PTR patch notes were aimed at correcting stat weighting imbalances. Feedback isn't being ignored; it's just being supplemented with lots of useful data from PTR testing that we're continuing to gather, and then numbers tweaks will follow.<br />
<br />
<br />

Patch 6.2<br />
Will we be able to test the legendary rings on the PTR? There are a few unclear mechanic interactions to test.<br />
We don't currently plan to put the legendary rings on the PTR. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/598992803524259840))<br />

Any plans for an Ogre Waygate in Tanaan Jungle?<br />
Yes! Look for it (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/95976-ancient-waygate-protector) in either the next PTR build or the one after. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/600423055911849984))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
When are you going to tune the Pandaria dungeons so we can solo? On that same note, what about the raids?<br />
As player power grows naturally with new tiers and expansions, you’ll be able to solo more old content. Same as always. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/600422848616747009))<br />

Why are Lunkers unique 5? It's annoying having to go back every 5 lunkers.<br />
The unique 5 restriction will be lifted in 6.2. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/599285175571218432))<br />

Misc<br />
Really disappointing your the lead designer for WoW. I'm sure a lot of people agree with me. Your focus is completely off :/<br />
Just saying: _A_ lead designer. Not _THE_ lead designer. We have a number of leads, all with different focuses and specialties. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/599026221473603584))<br />
Just because a single interview doesn't address every concern doesn't mean those concerns have fallen on deaf ears. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/599221341225558016))<br />
I could probably ramble for an hour about mistakes made and lessons learned, but the nature of an interview is a focused Q&amp;A. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/599221357688139776))<br />
<br />
Curious what AMR does for that problem now. Back on Rawr, we (mostly Kavan) built a genetic algorithm for it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/599265909350408193))<br />
We use a branch and bound technique with some cleverness. We then tested it against a brute-force method that combed EVERY combo<br />
Cool. I experimented with things like that, but I always ran into problems with cases where you had to take several... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/599824716363272192))<br />
...individual downgrades in a row, followed by a large individual downgrade, in order to find a net upgrade. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/599824926904725504))<br />
That occurred most commonly with combinations of hit caps, talent points, and especially set bonuses. Hard problems to optimize! (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/599825303402258432))<br />

<br />
Not necessarily true. They have confirmed 6.2 will not be the last content patch of WoD so I'm expecting a patch with another raid where we will fight Grommash and this will lead into the next expansion where gul'dan will be the main villain. Just my opinion though.</div></div><hr />

After completing the garrison quest chain I knew Grom would never be a boss we fight. I think he's going to realize who the real enemy is and turn the Iron Horde against Gul'dan and the Burning Legion.</div></div><hr />

Yes, I read it. But does that mean necessarily that &quot;there will be another raid&quot;?<br />
For all I know, last few expansions, end boss is the one who drops a mount, and Archimonde in this case does drop the mount! I know it's not the most &quot;scientific&quot; way to build my conclusion on, but it's something.</div></div><hr />

I didn't say I want Grommash specifically, I actually want Gul'dan, but even Grommash would make a more suitable expansion end boss than Archimonde!<br />

Not to defend Blizzard or anything, but even a hundred loud posters on the forums are nothing compared to the whole playerbase. Perfect example is Wildstar. So many many many loud people on the forums who wanted hard raids, 40 man etc etc. and what exactly did that bring? A complete failure. <br />
<br />
Forums never ever ever mean real feedback simply because it's a video game. People who enjoy it, play it. And millions of people seems to enjoy it since they pay for the subscription.<br />
<br />
So you have millions of paying customers and maybe 100 players who whine on the forums?</div></div><hr />

They also haven't said there will be another raid. So, people, stop with this 'blizz confirmed' bullshit, cause they didn't confirm anything, merely fed you more overhype.<br />
Besides, even when they confirm something, it doesn't hold any value nowadays.</div></div><hr />

I'm curious - why do you assume the decision was made long ago? I'm sorry you think we've just been lying all this time. (WatcherDev)<br />
<br />
LOL Well at least he's consistently disingenuous. Pretty sure a damage control post a few months ago said they'd let us know the answer to the flying question once the final decision had been made. Yet Blizz didn't even have the courage to give the community the answer directly, they slipped it into a third party website interview. In fact they still haven't made an official statement, just given lip service replies about how they appreciated all that feedback that they deleted. That's what pisses me off most, not that I lost flight for bullshit reasons, but that it was a blatant bait and switch. <br />
<br />
Hell the subs did in fact crater, regardless of flight , and the Blizz devs shrugged it off. Watcher wants us to believe that bringing back flight was actually on the table.. but if their reaction to nearly a third of their subscribers leaving was 'there's nothing wrong with WoD' how could we have possibly convinced them to change their mind on flight?</div></div><hr />

That probably means there are tens of thousands who agree with the decision, or what you see all the time if you know what it looks like: thousands of people who can't distinguish implementation from intent.

Yet Blizz didn't even have the courage to give the community the answer directly, they slipped it into a third party website interview. In fact they still haven't made an official statement, just given lip service replies about how they appreciated all that feedback that they deleted. That's what pisses me off most, not that I lost flight for bullshit reasons, but that it was a blatant bait and switch. <br />
<br />
Hell the subs did in fact crater, regardless of flight , and the Blizz devs shrugged it off. Watcher wants us to believe that bringing back flight was actually on the table.. but if their reaction to nearly a third of their subscribers leaving was 'there's nothing wrong with WoD' how could we have possibly convinced them to change their mind on flight?<br />
<br />
How is giving an answer in a public interview &quot;slipping it in&quot;? As soon as they make the decision they can share it, but it takes time to write a detailed blog post.<br />
<br />
And how do you figure that a drop in subs automatically means everything is wrong with WoD? You think flying is the only aspect of the game that's going to cause sub loss? Why did subs decline in Cata and MoP then? Maybe the vast majority of unsubs have nothing to do with flying. There is clearly something wrong with WoD, but the way you describe the problem, it would imply that WoW is nothing more than a very basic and unrealistic flight simulator.</div></div><hr />

Well, yeah, THOUSANDS of players disagree with the devs. But there are also THOUSANDS who agree with the devs. You don't hear as much from us because we're not whining about it.

Not to defend Blizzard or anything, but even a hundred loud posters on the forums are nothing compared to the whole playerbase. Perfect example is Wildstar. So many many many loud people on the forums who wanted hard raids, 40 man etc etc. and what exactly did that bring? A complete failure. <br />
<br />
Forums never ever ever mean real feedback simply because it's a video game. People who enjoy it, play it. And millions of people seems to enjoy it since they pay for the subscription.<br />
<br />
So you have millions of paying customers and maybe 100 players who whine on the forums?<br />
<br />
Um, you do realize you have that backwards right? People on the forums were screaming at them to put in 10m raids, knock off the attunement shit and lower the difficulty and they kicked their heels in and ignored them all. And well, you saw what happened. Also paying for the subscription doesn't mean you enjoy the whole game. Most are fine with the raiding but hate everything else and want to see it improved. &quot;Whining&quot; on the forums is called feedback.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I haven't played for a year, I left when flying was announced to not be an initial feature upon hitting level cap. I was one of the ones that decided that they didn't trust the Blizzard devs any longer, since the story for MoP was lack-luster, and the story for WoD was recycled fan fiction. I also didn't like the feeling of being lied to or mislead by the activities that they pushed on the playerbase and feeling forced to play every day to keep up. I was suffering from burn out. So this year has been good.<br />
<br />
That said, I was planning on coming back for 6.2, especially since they said flying would be back in at that point. Now I see that they've lied about flying, likely have cut the expac to 2 raid tiers, completely jacked any chance of actually fighting the characters presented as enemies in the marketing material for the expac, and jammed garrisons down everyone's throats to the point where you have to do them to get anything done.<br />
<br />
I offically have zero confidence in the WoW dev team at this point. You can make bold development choices, but those choices don't mean jack if no one conitnues to subscribe or buys your game anymore. Someone who actually cares about their profit margin needs to start keeping an eye on these guys, they are obviously incapable of managing themselves anymore.<br />
<br />
<br />
Honestly, I think even when there are about 1m subs left, Blizz and it's undeserved loyal fanbase will still be saying everything is fine and WoD was fantastic.<br />
<br />
Sadly this is true. I've played a lot of other MMOs that fans chimed as being fine and healthy right up to the day that full server shutdown and end of support was announced. CoH and Warhammer spring out pretty loud on that front, not to mention several other games. I think WoD will end with close to 4 mil subs at the most at this point, especially since they're at least 16+ months from the next expac.<br />
<br />
Not sure if it's warranted, but I continue to play all of Blizzards other games. I'm having a ton of fun with HotS too. It's not that Blizzard is a bad company or that their games all have major issues like WoW, but it's been pretty consistant for about 5 years now that they don't have a clue how to read their own customer base for WoW. And for a game that's had the number of individual accounts created for it over the years, not many people still play... There's something to that, but they continue to be clueless about it. Listening goes long way, disagreeing with your customers to the point of influencing 25%+ of them to leave does cross the line into being ignorant. Not bold, ignorant.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard's stance was that they were removing flight, and not intending on putting it back in, but would keep an open mind to how things progressed. <br />
<br />
They still haven't changed their minds.<br />
<br />
I'm quite happy to see the dev's taking a stand on what they think is best for the game, and not just designing to feedback on the forums. <br />
<br />
IMO, the game was at it's best when that was the case (Vanilla, BC, LK) and started going downhill when we hit the yoyo cycle of trying to play to the whim of the playerbase. It mad the game seem inconsistent and fragmented. <br />
<br />
I don't pay for a game based around what other people find enjoyable- I'd prefer to have developers whose ideas I like make a game, and then I can decide whether it's something I want to play or not. I feel like the game and the forums would be so much better if other people had a similar mindset. <br />
<br />

The only reason I can see people complaining is because they are lazy. People seem to think too highly of their opinions. &quot;Oh I don't like WoD game will die soon!&quot; &quot;Garrisons down my throat omg!&quot; Seriously...I have 4 lvl 100 with full garrisons, I log em grab what i need from the gardens, check if there's any gold mission available and move on with my day. Is it any different than before garrisons? No, instead of flying around Ogrimar or whatever hub there was at the time, I'm sit in my garrison doing random shit. <br />
<br />
Is WoD perfect? No. There's many thing that could improve, such as professions. The raids been great. The garrisons are ok. The leveling experience was the best yet. Ashram was a piece of shit there is no denying that. <br />
<br />
As for classes goes, I feel like they over did the pruning on some classes and didn't do enough in others, but this is something they can improve in the future. <br />
<br />
People leaving is something that will always happen, as soon as 6.2 comes out the subs will go up again, then they will go down once more and so on it will continue. This is how games work, people who bought GTA5 for example bought it enjoyed it and left it to collect dust, unless you are into that garbage online mode but to each it's own. Same happens to every mmo. Soon FF 14 ARR will launch it's expansion, the subs will go back to about 2 mils then they will sky rocket down again as people clear the content. <br />
<br />
If I was a dev at Blizzard I would fix WoD by doing the following:<br />
<br />
Remove the fucking legendary ring.<br />
Remove LFR.<br />
Increase the difficulty for heroic dungeons massively. <br />
Create more five man content and reduce the amount of bosses in the raids. 8 is a perfect number imo. Many of the bosses while cool in look would have made better 5 man style content. <br />
Remove the whole normal, heroic, mythic difficulties, make it either mythic &quot;Same Raid mechanics as mythic&quot; only or Normal/heroic only, with normal being what heroic is and heroic being mythic like you know in the old days....<br />
Make Ashram actually fun and rewarding OR fuck Ashram and make some fun Bgs...even if they are a Team death match Bg or some shit. <br />
Remove apexi crystals and shoot whoever came with the idea to implement that garbage.<br />
Bring back justice and valor points.<br />
Bring back reforging without hit/expertise. <br />
Remove the whole RNG warforged/gem slot crap, bring back the always slotted no war-forged bullshit. <br />
Bring back old profession bonuses.</div></div><hr />

This is not something that is no longer confined to either this site or the official forums. The amount of twitter and other place on youtube as well as other site are just simply blowing up. This caught fire yesterday and has gone simply ballistic. There are a lot of people simply leaving not only because of flying itself, but because its simply the last straw for many of them. It will be interesting to see what the next quarter numbers bring and they just happen to lose millions again. How will they simply wash those under the bridge with last bunch that left with the last bunch. Even if it 500k to million this time around they have never lost this many people in such of short of time and that is a lot of millions for the rest that remain to make up. I hope they got another store mount at the ready for this batch of people.<br />

Since Day 1 I figured there would be no flying. Unless, upon the last content patch, you could earn it somehow through a quest. But that'd be a stretch. I'm still surprised how many people thought it would actually happen. <br />
<br />
As for the sub losses .. that was highly predictable. Three million joined for the expansion, got their fill, then three million left. This happens. It's insanely common in MMOs. To think the sub loss was because suddenly everyone was dissatisfied is silly. Some? Sure. Three million? No. Will more leave? Who knows. 6.2 may be great. Or it may be too late for some people. But it's a natural cycle at this point. No MMO can last at WoW's numbers forever, even if the game did everything right. /shrug</div></div><hr />

For many, at least what I have been reading and watching so far say it not just about flying. It about how dissatisfied they are with the whole expansion so far the way Blizzard chose to release the information on a Friday during a holiday weekend through an interview. A lot of them have simply had enough over time and this just tip the scales for them. I am sure Tuesday and all the coming week is going to be interesting once even more people here the news that been off enjoying themselves. I can't wait to see the full damage control spin Blizzard puts on all of this. The expansion has already been shit in many ways and this is sure not going to help. I been saying since beta that storm was going to brew through this expansion like a wild fire and it has not been disappoint so far. I am sure there will be more turmoil. I think it will be amazing, if they come out of this expansion with 4 million subs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
But those loud people need to realize chances are very high flying will be back in the future. How far in the future is unanswerable question.<br />
<br />
You base this on... what, exactly? In actuality they've pretty much just said the exact opposite of this. The whole promise that they might maybe bring it back soon is what kept stringing people (and their subscription money) along for so darn long, and that's why people are ticked. Yeah, they might bring it back, but I'm not going to keep giving them money based on what they might do because they've now lost that trust with me. When they've returned to a game I want to play and have actually implemented these changes instead of hinting or promising that they might implement them, THEN and ONLY THEN will I resub.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'd rather listen to a few tried and true professionals than thousands of idiots.<br />
<br />
When &quot;tried and true&quot; means that you've started to lose business for your company as a result of your decisions, you're likely no longer the person who needs to be listened to. If a CEO runs a company the way he sees fit, and customers disagree and start voting with their wallets, and the company tanks, that is not a CEO you want to run your next company. In fact, if you're that first company you might see fit to replace your leadership when you start to see your business falter so that it doesn't tank in the first place. <br />
<br />
Whatever the reason for the exodus, there has NEVER been a sub loss so sharp in so little time at any point in WoW's 10-year history. The fact that it has now happened says something as to just how &quot;tried and true&quot; those &quot;professionals&quot; are, and their response was that they'd planned it that way all along. Really? What kind of business plans to lose customers on a regular basis rather than to concentrate on retaining them?<br />
<br />
<br />
So developers should just be mindless drones to implement your every whim and desire?<br />
<br />
The business concept is simple. You either make a product your customers like and will buy, or you cheapen your product, alienate your customers, and eventually go out of business. There's something to be said for an artist and his vision, but that's why the idea of the &quot;starving artist&quot; exists. If you're making something you want to sell, then yes... You have to listen to your customers. There will always be a few fanboys who are willing to buy an inferior product because of brand loyalty or the fact that they appreciate your integrity, but eventually more and more people are going to start wondering why they're essentially giving you money for something they don't want, because reasons.<br />
<br />
<br />
I've played a lot of other MMOs that fans chimed as being fine and healthy right up to the day that full server shutdown and end of support was announced. CoH and Warhammer spring out pretty loud on that front, not to mention several other games. I think WoD will end with close to 4 mil subs at the most at this point, especially since they're at least 16+ months from the next expac.<br />
<br />
You see it with a lot of games that went from subscriptions to F2P or B2P, too. SWTOR and ESOL immediately spring to mind.<br />
<br />
I won't say my prediction is quite as dire as yours. I'm going to go with 5 million, but it could possibly dip into the 4 million area. The first 3 million in losses were simply the players who came back after MoP and then turned around and left. There will likely be a couple million more in losses through Q4 as people get sick of playing World of Garrisoncraft.<br />
<br />
<br />
No one ever said flying would be back in 6.2, other than hopeful people on the forums. <br />
<br />
Au contraire! (http://www.wowhead.com/news=223780/no-flying-in-draenor-until-6-1) The subject of flight was discussed in at least one panel during the last Blizcon, where the devs specifically said that they'd likely give us flight in the first content patch if not sooner. To quote Bashiok in the link I've just provided:<br />
<br />
<br />
We intend to disallow flying while leveling from 90 to 100, and have flying become available again in the first major patch for Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
So yes... We were told we would have flight by now. We were lied to. After that, it became a game of &quot;give us feedback and we'll maybe give it back to you.&quot; This has gone on for months, stringing people along so that they'd continue to subscribe and keep their accounts and characters current in hopes of getting flight back. THAT is why people are pissed.<br />
<br />
<br />
IMO, the game was at it's best when that was the case (Vanilla, BC, LK) and started going downhill when we hit the yoyo cycle of trying to play to the whim of the playerbase. It mad the game seem inconsistent and fragmented. <br />
<br />
And while I'll agree with you on this, as you'll notice the sub numbers were at its peak during this time, you might also take note of the state of flying during BC and LK. <br />
<br />
<br />
I don't pay for a game based around what other people find enjoyable- I'd prefer to have developers whose ideas I like make a game, and then I can decide whether it's something I want to play or not. I feel like the game and the forums would be so much better if other people had a similar mindset. <br />
<br />
Don't like the dev's ideas? Quit and find a dev team you do like the ideas of.<br />
<br />
That's precisely what's happening. People are in fact leaving because they don't pay for a game they don't find enjoyable, and on their way out, they're providing feedback so that the people who might want to make money don't have to wildly guess. People have played this game for years and feel a sense of loyalty, so it makes sense that they hate to see it driven into the ground and want to provide input to keep that from happening before they take the ultimate step of giving up on it.<br />
<br />
Just ask yourself how much longer you'll have that game you enjoy when Blizzard cuts it completely because not enough people are playing anymore. It's very much in your interest that as many people are playing the game as possible and are happy while doing so.<br />

As I pointed out in my last post, we believed it would happen because Blizzard actually told us it would happen (paragraph two, first sentence) (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/10571977123?page=1#6). We continued to believe it because the devs kept saying that they might give it back.<br />
<br />
And while these sub losses do in fact happen in other MMOs, they don't happen in WoW. No other MMO has even close to the number of subs WoW has. WoW has never in its over ten years of existence seen a sub loss so dramatic that happened so quickly. So, no... This doesn't happen, and yes it happened because everyone was dissatisfied. If you are in fact satisfied, you keep playing. Keeping people interested enough to continue playing used to be a finely tuned skill for Blizzard. It's not so much anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
<br />
Remove LFR.<br />
<br />
*sigh* I can't imagine you have any truly good reason for why you'd want to do this,<br />
let alone why you'd think this is a good idea (say goodbye to millions more subscribers<br />
and you being called the dev that nailed the coffin in WoW)<br />
<br />
<br />
Increase the difficulty for heroic dungeons massively.<br />
<br />
&quot;Massively?&quot; And what is &quot;massively?&quot; BC lvl? Cata lvl? Them combined?<br />
Since they give nothing in terms of rewards, this would be one of the<br />
single worst ideas a dev could ever do.<br />
<br />
<br />
Create more five man content and reduce the amount of bosses in the raids.<br />
8 is a perfect number imo. Many of the bosses while cool in look would have made better 5 man style content.<br />
<br />
<br />
Finally, you have a decent idea. Yes, there needs to be more multi-group content. Raid however, don't need to<br />
be shorter, they need to be longer imo. Kind of that fine line of Kara &amp; Uld.<br />
<br />
<br />
Remove the whole normal, heroic, mythic difficulties, make it either mythic &quot;Same Raid mechanics as mythic&quot; only or Normal/heroic only, with normal being what heroic is and heroic being mythic like you know in the old days....<br />
<br />
Wait what?<br />
<br />
<br />
Make Ashram actually fun and rewarding OR fuck Ashram and make some fun Bgs...even if they are a Team death match Bg or some shit. <br />
<br />
And how do you purpose to make Ashran &quot;fun&quot; exactly?<br />
<br />
<br />
Remove apexi crystals and shoot whoever came with the idea to implement that garbage.<br />
<br />
I'm not a great fan of the crystals, but removing means how are people going to gear up? Just doing heroic dungeons?<br />
That'd be completely foolish.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bring back justice and valor points.<br />
<br />
So then instead of grinding just one currency for gear, we should go back to grinding two currencies by doing dungeons<br />
and heroic dungeons ad nauseum? That's an even worse idea that your previous ones.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bring back reforging without hit/expertise. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Remove the whole RNG warforged/gem slot crap, bring back the always slotted no war-forged bullshit. <br />
<br />
This I kind of agree. RNG in itself is a pure bullshit system, and the procs of getting an item that's slightly more powerful<br />
isn't exactly &quot;fun&quot; to me personally.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bring back old profession bonuses.<br />
<br />
Why? So most people can ignore or be forced to pick some because of their bonuses? That's absurd.<br />
<br />
After reading all that you had to say, I'm really glad you're not a dev.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But those also seem like they will last through the whole expansion, and perhaps next expansion as well. Maybe means no more raiding this expansion and they get nerfed to not work if you are over level 100, which would also confirm level cap is getting increased again.</div></div><hr />

Unless, upon the last content patch, you could earn it somehow through a quest. But that'd be a stretch. I'm still surprised how many people thought it would actually happen. <br />
<br />
As for the sub losses .. that was highly predictable. Three million joined for the expansion, got their fill, then three million left. This happens. It's insanely common in MMOs. To think the sub loss was because suddenly everyone was dissatisfied is silly. Some? Sure. Three million? No. Will more leave? Who knows. 6.2 may be great. Or it may be too late for some people. But it's a natural cycle at this point. No MMO can last at WoW's numbers forever, even if the game did everything right. /shrug<br />
<br />
That is a pathetic, pathetic excuse. While I think that flying was the straw that broke the camel's back here is a good video on the issue of WoD as a pathetic expansion.<br />

<br />
Instead of mindlessly calling his opinions wrong, be more constructive? A lot of features in this game are relative, and just because they exist to satisfy a player-base doesn't mean they're good for the game in the long run. Honestly, I trust Blizzard more now than I did 5 years ago. They tried a lot of things that they weren't sure about, some of it worked and some of it didn't. They actually have some statistically significant data to work off of, and I'm sure they're trying to put out a solid product. This is Blizzard we're talking about, they don't put out ****. <br />
<br />
Anyway, personally I feel like LFR needs to go. A lot of casual players might not agree or have a different opinion, but that's just how I feel. It's hard for me to have an unbiased opinion on this though, as I raid mythics. I prefer to be competitive. I've never met/played with someone who enjoyed LFR. It teaches you nothing and you're not working for the gear you get so there's really no satisfaction from it. You can see the story doing normal mode in slightly more time, with a little bit more work, and with significantly more satisfaction. But that's the point of the game. This isn't a TV-show where you just sit back and watch things happen... which is more or less what LFR is.<br />
<br />
Apex crystals are cancer. They're completely trivial and the grind for them is ridiculous. You kill mobs and hand in one quest. It's a lazy way of getting people gear and it isn't engaging at all. Dailies, dungeons, craftables were all much more engaging than whatever Apex is supposed to be.<br />
<br />
I feel as though randomized gear is one of the best things they've added to raiding in a long time. Having to settle for one item because it is always the best item you can get makes gearing incredibly boring. A lot of raiders get full max ilvl gear within a month of raiding and the moment they finish progression they have nothing to do for however many months. Again, the level of gear you have on average will be the same as everyone else just because that's how RNG works. All it does is add a continually rewarding level to gearing that doesn't effect progression in a significant way. Reforging was clunky and incredibly inconvenient. You got one piece of gear and then you had to redo your entire reforge, sometimes the upgrade wasn't even an upgrade because of how stats didn't line up. It required addons to min-max with and added nothing to the game aside from having to do some trivial math.<br />
<br />
And as far as flying goes, I don't care either way. It was convenient, but also relative. They can improve other aspects of the game to bring back convenience without you flying over all the content. They put a lot of work into the environment and want you to become emerged in it... not fly over it and ignore it for the most part.<br />
<br />
There are always improvements that can be made, and coding/development isn't as easy as just doing what everyone wants. Blizzard fell into this trap of giving people what they wanted when they wanted it, and now it's sort've biting them in the ass. Enjoy the game for what it is, because I feel like a lot of people are just stuck on hating on aspects they don't like.</div></div><hr />

<br />
every reason they have given is completely subjective bullshit, enforced on us only because afrasiabi's a fucking baby that needs to have his way and only his way.<br />
<br />
this game used to be about choice. you could raid, you could dungeon, you could do dailies and fly and all that good stuff. now, it's raid or pvp or gtfo. dungeons 100% useless, so few dailies it's pathetic, and no flying. this is the type of person afrasiabi is, a manchild with a &quot;my way or no way&quot; attitude. he'd gladly sink this game just to spite players that want to fly or have the old style of dungeon progression back.</div></div><hr />

Kappa.<br />

<br />
Remove the fucking legendary ring.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why?<br />
<br />
<br />
because the fucking MOP cloak / WOD ring is a massive , unnecessary barrier of entry to raiding and heavily discourages player playing more than 1 char. <br />
<br />
u joined the expac halfway and have not even completed the highmaul part quest for the ring ? see you in 2-3 months mate, absolutely no raiding spot for u until u catch up with ur ring quests. <br />
<br />
and the players that joined halfway be like , oh well , cya guys unsubbing. The ring progression is extremely retarded, u cant just &quot;play more, be more hardcore&quot; to speed up the ring progression , u just sit in the city after u clear highmaul / brf n wait for the next reset. Its just stupid. <br />
<br />
Unless they allow people to run highmaul / brf over and over to catch up on ring progression (only able to loot boss 1 time / week but the quest item can be collected every kill despite being loot locked) or i do feel they need to remove this retarded &quot;legendary&quot; system they introduced in MOP. They still need to clear the raids multiple times to get the ring quests done, so there will be no complaints for who played more , who played less, everyone put in equal amount of effort to progress their rings just that they do it in a shorter timeframe because they played shit tons more in that timeframe to get it done.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I respectfully disagree, without lfr I never would've progressed on to doing mythic raids, raiding was always this super daunting thing and PuG mentalities did not aid in this. Having never tried raiding properly I was apprehensive about joining a raiding guild because the few experiences I had in a pug were dreadful, pressure-filled and altogether unpleasant. At the same time I wanted to see those grand kind of battles where we all take down a monolithic foe. With lfr I was able to take my first steps into the encounter in a much more relaxed manner, and get a broad picture of how the encounters played out better than watching videos or reading dungeon journal. So when I finally tried some Pugs again I knew the encounter and how to apply the knowledge of videos and dungeon journals and just felt a lot more comfortable just being in the instance itself. Flash forward to WoD and I'm blazing through day 1 when the raids open, without that initial confidence boost from LFR I probably never would have touched raiding again. I also actually enjoy just trying out new strategies and talent setups in lfr rather than wasting raid hours. I've never understood why people who don't use lfr complain about it though, the people who do it are getting pretty shit gear that looks all round terrible in WoD and I don't think it destroys any fantasy of the bosses being powerful because by the time all the wings come out most of us have finished the normal and heroic encounters about 3-4 times. So I guess I'm just wondering how you think its absence will improve your gameplay experience?</div></div><hr />

I absolutely loved BC for flying. Not because it made things easier... but because it opened up new content when you got to max level. You got to places you couldn't before and that was exiting and fun. <br />

To me - BLizzard is to blame for not making content that makes flying exciting and fun in WOD. Thats why they have no reason to add it now. And for that they should be reminded how poor choice they made from the start of designing the expansion.<br />

Not adding flying going forwards isn't the same as removing flying from the game.<br />

We'll be able to fly in old content. They might even let us fly in Draenor after the next expansion launches. We should just be prepared to not be able to fly in new expansions while they are current.</div></div><hr />

Perfect example is Wildstar. So many many many loud people on the forums who wanted hard raids, 40 man etc etc. and what exactly did that bring? A complete failure. <br />
<br />
Forums never ever ever mean real feedback simply because it's a video game. People who enjoy it, play it. And millions of people seems to enjoy it since they pay for the subscription.<br />
<br />
So you have millions of paying customers and maybe 100 players who whine on the forums?<br />
<br />
Forums have &lt;a small value&gt;% real value for a game developer since there is so much noise.<br />
It still doesn't mean that players dictate the game's future. Haters will keep hating and players will come and go.<br />

PVP has never worked well in WoW. Since it's now F2P with Garrison missions (I make 40k a week with 6 L100 Garrisons), you can spend your money on GuildWars or something.<br />

<br />
&quot;THOUSANDS&quot; (lets say 2000) of players thinking something is wrong with the game is only approx .02% of the 7000000 subscribers (approx) which is really not that many at all.<br />
<br />
if 7 million people play this game, I would have thought the Dev's are pretty good at what they do. and maybe THOUSANDS of players are playing the wrong game.</div></div><hr />

We'll be able to fly in old content. They might even let us fly in Draenor after the next expansion launches. We should just be prepared to not be able to fly in new expansions while they are current.<br />

This comment is beyond stupid. This is exactly the same as removing flying entirely. Old content is old content because it's old. Allowing to fly there means nothing for current character progression and quality of life.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Wries</div><div class="date">2015-05-25, 02:36 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I respectfully disagree, without lfr I never would've progressed on to doing mythic raids, raiding was always this super daunting thing and PuG mentalities did not aid in this. Having never tried raiding properly I was apprehensive about joining a raiding guild because the few experiences I had in a pug were dreadful, pressure-filled and altogether unpleasant. At the same time I wanted to see those grand kind of battles where we all take down a monolithic foe. With lfr I was able to take my first steps into the encounter in a much more relaxed manner, and get a broad picture of how the encounters played out better than watching videos or reading dungeon journal. So when I finally tried some Pugs again I knew the encounter and how to apply the knowledge of videos and dungeon journals and just felt a lot more comfortable just being in the instance itself. Flash forward to WoD and I'm blazing through day 1 when the raids open, without that initial confidence boost from LFR I probably never would have touched raiding again. I also actually enjoy just trying out new strategies and talent setups in lfr rather than wasting raid hours. I've never understood why people who don't use lfr complain about it though, the people who do it are getting pretty shit gear that looks all round terrible in WoD and I don't think it destroys any fantasy of the bosses being powerful because by the time all the wings come out most of us have finished the normal and heroic encounters about 3-4 times. So I guess I'm just wondering how you think its absence will improve your gameplay experience?<br />
<br />
The idea here is that far more new players enter LFR and go &quot;huh, so that faceroll is what raiding is? Ok, seen the content, time to unsub&quot;. If that is true or not is hard to say as all we have to go on are gut feelings and anecdotal stories from both sides of the argument.</div></div><hr />

In blizzards case that is simple not true. They disagreed with flying since the start and strung gamers along the whole time with it might return. However you can bet since the decision was made to keep flying gone so long Any comments on flying coming back were indeed ignored. Ignored and disagreed with being the same in this case.<br />

Id imagine we're going to see something similar to the WoD release with flying everywhere except the actual players in content they just bought.<br />
<br />
Flying mounts everywhere, being sold in the cash shop, sold in the collectors edition, rewards for doing things in game. Did I mention being sold in the cash shop every couple months?<br />
<br />
Flying will be everywhere but not for the paying gamer. The decision to move forward with no flying was made long ago and you can be guaranteed if you enjoyed it for the past 8 years, you're being ignored at this point and not just disagreed with.</div></div><hr />

Ok, seen the content, time to unsub&quot;. If that is true or not is hard to say as all we have to go on are gut feelings and anecdotal stories from both sides of the argument.<br />
<br />
Ok, here's a reason.<br />
<br />
I'm still leery about raiding as it's difficult to get into some guilds because of requirements and general shitty attitudes. However, if it weren't for LFR in the last expac, I wouldn't be even CONSIDERING the possibility of trying for some normal raid runs, of Highmaul at the least.<br />
<br />
Also, me and my boyfriend play together. I have a bit more free time to play than he does, but day raiding is a bit more difficult for me to do cause, guess what? People usually work during the day. Night raiding is mostly impossible for us because 1) I work night shifts and 2) he's gotta be in bed early as he has an early 9 hour ahift everyday.<br />
<br />
So, rl tends to get in the way. LFR is our best way to enjoy the actual content to continue the story as we can knock that out quick on a Saturday night. Without it, we wouldn't be able to finish any of the stories.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, we're no longer students who tend to have a whole lot more free time to devote to N/H/M raiding. Though I applaud raiding guilds who ACTUALLY take that shit into consideration and don't act like elitist assholes and help players like myself and the bf to get there. But they are hard to find.<br />
<br />
The flying nonsense is just that: nonsense. If they plan on sticking to the whole no flying in the future thing, then they better not EVER design more mounts who have wings or float off the ground. Cause they look awkward as hell when grounded.<br />
<br />
I want flying back mainly because some mining nodes like to spawn in random spots you honestly can't platform to. I also like to take scenery photos. And I LOVE looking for nooks and crannies and getting to content that has to have flying.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think he means that relative to the 'AU&quot; Draenor story, Archimonde has not been involved at all. Though there is a toy item that hinted at this(the one that summons a holograph of Archimonde criticizing Kil'jaeden's work on Draenor. <br />
<br />
I do find it interesting we're fighting Archimonde because in Rise of the Horde he actually showed little interest in chasing down the Draenei and thus didn't want to be involved with Kil'jaeden's crusade against them on Draenor. Though at the same time I'm not surprised that he's there since Sargeras wanted them to last long enough for Gul'dan to make contact with Medivh, so it comes as no surprise he'd want to 'extend' the Legion's campaign on Draenor to make that happen.</div></div><hr />

I would say that it is. While WoD certainly has some flaws, it's still better than MoP was pre-Thunder. And it's certainly a hell of a lot better than WotLK was pre-Ulduar (hello, revamped facerollable Naxx!). And everyone seems to hate how Cata was on release, and cried endlessly about the dungeons being too hard.<br />
<br />
The only expansion that people didn't whine endlessly about during the first half of its lifetime was TBC. But that's hard to compete with now, as vanilla had a lot of obvious flaws that needed fixing, like the completely screwed up talent trees, the ultra-obscure libram system, and the extremely boring vanilla healing model.</div></div><hr />

I struggle to comprehend this, how is it stringing along, Blizzard's position was from the start that they felt the absence of flying was a good thing. That is the main assumption under which everyone should have been operating, anyone who was hanging out for it to return because they added the caveat that it MIGHT return in a future patch is an idiot. You don't assume that the unlikely thing is going to happen and then get mad when it doesn't, what kind of backwards ass logic is that?</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're wrong for obvious reasons, I don't need to write paragraphs on why they are.<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway, personally I feel like LFR needs to go. A lot of casual players might not agree or have a different opinion, but that's just how I feel. It's hard for me to have an unbiased opinion on this though, as I raid mythics.<br />
<br />
So since you have an unbiased, possibly close-minded viewpoint on this subject...why even bring it up?<br />
<br />
<br />
I've never met/played with someone who enjoyed LFR.<br />
<br />
And yet despite how there are millions of players who use it, screw them, it has to go right?<br />
<br />
<br />
It teaches you nothing<br />
<br />
*SIGH*<br />
<br />
This is just a thousand times wrong, and its probably one of the worst straw man points that some players use<br />
to try &quot;justify&quot; the removal of LFR. And I'm sure most of us are sick to death of seeing this.<br />
<br />
<br />
and you're not working for the gear you get so there's really no satisfaction from it.<br />
<br />
Aaaaaaand there it is. The self-entitlement argument.<br />
<br />
Correct me if I'm wrong, but its not like the players zone in, get their X amount of gold, get their quest items,<br />
get their buff item, and get lucky and get their piece of gear and zone out.<br />
<br />
We have to clear trash, and kill a boss. Just like how a normal and above raid does. Only with yes, less mechanics<br />
and difficulty. But we still have to kill something. Just because it isn't as hard as your way is does not somehow<br />
make it not legitimate.<br />
<br />
Certain players need to get off that high horse, and just be happy that they are able to clear those higher tiers of<br />
difficulty with their guilds and move on. Let the rest of the player base have something to ourselves.<br />
<br />
Last I checked, WoW isn't an &quot;exclusive&quot; club, so stop acting like it is.<br />
<br />
<br />
You can see the story doing normal mode in slightly more time, with a little bit more work, and with significantly more satisfaction.<br />
<br />
Yeah, IF (and that's the catch here) IF those players can. Most can't. But hey, screw them right?<br />
<br />
<br />
But that's the point of the game.<br />
<br />
No, the point of the game is to have fun, and make it accessible to various kinds of players. Somehow, because players are able to<br />
do the same thing as more elite raiders can do but on a lesser scale (like LFR), players (such as you) feel as if your accomplishments<br />
are somehow wasted or in a bizarre nonsensical way, somehow you feel insulted and self-entitled, and believe that they should not<br />
have a taste of it too, because they aren't &quot;putting in the work&quot; or some nonsense.<br />
<br />
How about this, let them have their fun, you have yours. Why is this so hard I just don't know.<br />
<br />
<br />
This isn't a TV-show where you just sit back and watch things happen... which is more or less what LFR is.<br />
<br />
Then change the channel. Nobody is forcing you to watch that tv show btw.</div></div><hr />

So what? If its not your cup of tea, its time to find an alternative you like more. Let the customers (all of them) decide whether that art continues to be funded or not. If it has enough customers, the game will continue. If it doesn't, then it will not and Blizzard will likely keeping producing other games of various styles to pay the bills. If they don't, they will eventually fold and other companies will gain market share. That is the natural order of things... not some whack-a-mole dev process chasing customer whines.</div></div><hr />

I'd really like to see Gul'dan as a raid boss, he's definitely one of the most iconic and well written villainous Orcs.<br />
<br />
Seriously, how can Archimonde even be the end boss?! He wasn't featured in the story so far, we'll just see him for the first time in Hellfire! Gul'dan should be the final boss not some sort of a twisted Eredar!Ahahaha, oh jeez you're silly! He's actually had a large role in the Burning Crusade expansion, He's one of two final bosses for Tier 6 (along side Illidan). And he's been a prominent lore character since Warcraft II at least. Maybe even Warcraft: Orcs and Humans, but don't quote me on that.<br />
<br />
I certainly agree he's not end boss material, and he's not. If you may recall- every expansion has had at least three major content patches. This is the second, the third will likely feature our old orc adversaries. Blizzard knows it'd be disingenuous to not provide a challenging big orc boss for the WARLORDS OF DRAENOR expansion, and given how the Legendary Ring quest chain is progressing, it's likely Gul'dan is going to feature as either his own secular boss or the end boss for Warlords of Draenor.
