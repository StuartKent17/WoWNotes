What did you expect? It's the next moneymaker. WoW is no longer their baby (even though it still makes them the most money).<br />

Times change, WoW has been their flagship for 13 years now, I just hope they do something more with OW like a single player game or something.</div></div><hr />

Overwatch doesn't make anywhere even close to as much money as Hearthstone. Hearthstone is literally what pays the salary of almost all Blizzard employees. It's crazy.</div></div><hr />

People act like balance troubles are exclusive to Blizz games, when spoiler alert, it's a problem in every game that has any balancing required.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hearthstone is a very simple game, but it's not the game that makes the most money that stays as the flagship, sometimes a company just want to put more effort and time into one specific game and that has become Overwatch now, and with the Overwatch League about to start it'll just get even bigger. <br />
<br />
Plus, if they're working on a single player component or heck, even an MMO then that'd be amazing too. Tom Chilton and Holinka are both working on a secret project now, so I do wonder what that is going to be like.</div></div><hr />

I would GLADLY take a blizzcon ticket for $40! But as a virtual ticket holder that usually buys the goodie bag I think I'll get the virtual ticket and pass on the goodie bag. Loved my diablo keychain companion and the messenger bag from last year.</div></div><hr />

In 2017 - https://www.superdataresearch.com/us-digital-games-market/ - Hearthstone nowhere to be seen.<br />

In 2016, it was named the most profitable game for ALL pc games, not even for Blizzard alone - https://www.vg247.com/2016/12/22/overwatch-brought-in-more-money-than-any-other-paid-pc-game-in-2016/<br />
<br />
https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/04/with-1-billion-in-revenue-overwatch-is-blizzards-fastest-growing-franchise/ (you can check the report itself as well): &quot;Overwatch is the eighth Activision Blizzard game to generate $1 billion in revenue, according to the publisher’s fiscal Q1 2017 financial statement. And the company says it is the fastest-growing franchise ever from developer Blizzard. It now has 30 million registered players, and a significant number of those play on an active monthly basis. Overwatch’s success has also contributed to 80 percent of Activision Blizzard’s revenues coming from digital channels. That’s $1.386 billion of the publisher’s $1.726 billion total net revenues last quarter.&quot;<br />

I guess by now you're used to being in a permanent delusional state.</div></div><hr />

While I completely agree that Overwatch is making them a ton of money I'm going to have to call shenanigans on Venture beat's declaration that it made up $1.386 billion of the $1.726 billion Activision Blizzard earned in the first quarter of 2017.<br />
<br />
Because if you looked into the financial reports you'll see that the company as a whole earned $1.73 billion. And that King Entertainment had 342 MaU dwarfing Blizzard's 41 MaU (million active users). Assuming there's quite a bit of F2P in game purchasing going on then King's contribution should be quite a bit larger.<br />
<br />
Now follow me to page 15 of : http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/ACTI/4680841791x0x941187/1EAB2D82-EEE6-40CC-B411-E02F6817700B/Q1_2017_ATVI_Press_Release.pdf<br />
<br />
You'll see that in that quarter Blizzard made $441 million and King $474 million. No I think what we're seeing here is the article author taking the statement &quot;Overwatch is the eighth Activision Blizzard game to generate $1 billion in revenue&quot; and assuming they did that in the first quarter of 2017. When technically they've had since the 2nd quarter of 2016 to generate that $1 billion in revenue.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, seemed quite perplexed at that too - I more so wanted to highlight the 1bn in total revenues from OW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Oh lol. Did not actually know that haha. :) <br />
<br />
I feel a bit silly for being behind on the times now.<br />
<br />
This is only the 3rd year the Goody Bag has been available to Virtual Ticket holders.<br />

You'll have one [very] soon™.<br />
I think you must be thinking of the digital items? Otherwise, that would be a rather surprising change from the last two bags where the only physical items the VT holders didn't get was the badge and lanyard, the printed program and some vendor pamphlets/floor games.<br />
<br />
The digital items are part of the Virtual Ticket itself, not the Goody Bag, so you shouldn't include those.<br />
<br />
I think the photos show everything.</div></div><hr />

Nope. The actual physical Goodie Bag (box this year) that we will receive has more inside it than what is presented in this post. As with the past years, there's more to each bag/box than small trinkets. There's at least ONE thing missing from that video/pictures. That's all I stated. Have faith ... you'll see. ;0)<br />
<br />
[Edit]<br />
<br />
As life seems to have it, something that is supposed to be included wasn't in the live stream. So .. I'm not sure if it was cancelled or left as a surprise though it makes no sense why they would do that (?). If I find out why the item was missing from the livestream, I'll post it here. :0\</div></div><hr />

I don't watch unboxing videos... but this guy doesn't really sound happy that he's getting this stuff... even for his &quot;favorite&quot; character, he had this unhappy turn at the end of every &quot;yay!&quot; that made it sound sarcastic.</div></div><hr />
