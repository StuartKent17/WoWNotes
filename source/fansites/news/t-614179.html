Next Patch: Background Downloader<br />
The next major content patch is coming, and it's big. In order to smooth the way, we will shortly enable background downloading of most of the data for this patch. People who use the Launcher and have background downloading enabled will automatically start getting the data. The Downloader downloads faster in general now, so you may want to adjust your background download settings. You can adjust these settings in the Laucher, by visiting the Options page. If you want the fastest possible download, check the &quot;Don't throttle background download&quot;. However, note that this can affect the performance of other programs running at the same time.</div></div><hr />

The 3.0.2 is going to go on the PTR, but they're just preparing for it in advance, and changing the things that needs to be changed as time goes by ;)</div></div><hr />

<br />
A) Beta Realm Maintenance and Patch - 9/10/08 - This means, the Beta Realms are going down (did go down) f端r a new patch<br />
<br />
B) Next Patch: Background Downloader - This means, they have new options f端r the background downloader (for live realms) and there will SOON be PARTS of the new patch to download. This does not mean, 3.0.2 is going live soon. We often had patches wo went live several weeks after the first parts where available for download.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">lagmoose</div><div class="date">2008-09-10, 11:30 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was wondering why I went to start wow and got the launcher and patch update.<br />
<br />
Also I'd like to mention that for when I went to start the launcher again after it installed, for a brief moment it had the Wrath of the Lich King logo instead of the BC logo, but then it quickly turned into the BC logo with the launcher splash page showing the Blizzard iTunes news. Some people said they've seen it and other said they haven't so I hope I'm not going crazy. :p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Draynaria</div><div class="date">2008-09-10, 11:34 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, brief flash of the WotLK logo for me too. I say brief, long enough to actually see if before the normal splash screen loads.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Faelyn</div><div class="date">2008-09-10, 11:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Yep, definitely a flash of the WotLK logo before the BC logo on the launcher. :)</div></div><hr />

You certainly did not play warhammer yet to make you say that. Its nothing ground breaking.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Saberoy</div><div class="date">2008-09-11, 01:26 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">the last two messages are starting to make less and less sense. If Raikaga was saying it would be released onto PTR before warhammer online, I'd say I agree.</div></div><hr />

I guess that's what it did :P<br />
<br />
Always download the full patch from mirrors listed on wowwiki though. it's a lot faster.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jet</div><div class="date">2008-09-12, 03:02 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I got the launcher update. Then tonight I got a patch message on launcher. Was set up for download while playing which isn't how I normally run it. Anyway when I logged I saw the little tornado downloader thing for an instant but no info about what I may have downloaded anywhere. Seems odd a friend said her launcher showed it was big patch that would take a while to download. I re launched and no info at all. Quit playing mind games downloader lol.</div></div><hr />
