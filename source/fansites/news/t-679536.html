<br />
Look at the axe used to create the legendary (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/49888/shadows-edge/) to see a rough comparison of the difference. Hard mode 25 will be ilvl 271 and be slightly better than shadows edge, but it wont be 50DPS, 13 stam, 38 str, extra red socket, 22 crit, 22 arpen, and a ridiculous proc better.</div></div><hr />

You obviously didn't play pre bc if you think any 2h users benefited from Sulfuras. That was replaced into AQ40, and by the GM weapons ten fold. Not to mention lawlnaxxramas. Sulf didn't remain &quot;legendary&quot; for very long.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because I cannot summon Shadowmourne and actually have to wait until a GM does it before I can query the stats, just like anyone else. <br />

Sulfuras was used well into AQ40, which was 2 tiers above where you get it (MC). Also, GM weapons were exceedingly hard to get (until they changed how you got the weapons it was more rare and took more effort than any legendary ever).</div></div><hr />

I believe it's quested for, so the only thing plate wearers might argue about is who gets to loot the quest items to make it(ice shards from the throne), and that's if they're one person per loot.<br />

Before I'd say Val'anyr was a glorified epic. Now with the combination of pretty decent weapon procs off of drops in IC and Shadowmourne, I can no longer even call it that. Val'anyr is a plain-old epic now. brb, gonna cry myself to sleep.</div></div><hr />

I hope your talking about 2h melee becuz the only 1h weapons were thunderfury and the glaives and yes i know some shaman got sulfuras but i think they shoulda made shadowmourne split into 2 1h axes so all almost all melee benefited from it and hunters =P</div></div><hr />

...so...what, do you want them to go back to Sunwell and change the tier now? Kind of late for that, eh?<br />
And you want the 2hand melee guys to get a less awesome weapon just because the past has not shown hunters or casters as much love?<br />

<br />
WOW. Did you like not play during TBC, like, at all?<br />
<br />
Some old patch 2.4.2 theorycrafting:<br />
<br />
The biggest thing that makes this bow revolutionary is the fact it doesn't use ammo. Alot of people (obviously not theory-crafters), have asserted that the loss of 53dps ammo makes it a little less incredible. They are completely wrong. Steady shot damage is unaffected by ammunition, thereby not gaining the 53 dps boost auto-shot gained. While it was speculated Blizzard might change the formula to include ammunition to the damage somehow, this bow clearly predates that possible change. This bow will make steadyshot the grand majority of a hunter's DPS, and with bonuses from the T6 4-set bonus, where steadyshot damage is increased by 10%, this bow is going to make a huge difference. This bow is clearly above the rest, if you were to take any other bow and add 53 dps and remove the ammo requirement, it would have an incredible DPS boost already, but this bow does it with clearly superior stats. It basically adds 53 dps to steady shot damage on an incredibly buff bow. I expect to see hunter's DPS above Warlocks and Rogues regularly with this bow.<br />
<br />
Obviously this advantage was removed in patch 3.0.2 when Steady Shot was updated to include ammo damage, but the legendary was HUGE for hunters because of the 'bug' (as some called) that boosted Steady Shots to crazy amounts until Wrath's launch.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">akechi</div><div class="date">2009-11-19, 02:15 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The stats are very nice indeed.<br />
<br />
Also, they are completely in line with what Val'anyr ... well ... was.<br />
<br />
Val'anyr is half tier above Ulduar25 heroic loot. It has stats equivalent to epic weapon of ilvl245 + really nice proc.<br />
<br />
Shadowmourne is half tier above ICC heroic loot and has stats in line of what epic ilvl284 2H should have.<br />
<br />
Some math .. 1 tier = ~12% better stats (ok prolly an overstatement). Shadow's Edge has 297 base dps and is ilvl 264. 297 * 1.12^(1.5) = 348 base dps .. which is actually a little more than what Shadowmourne has.<br />
<br />
Now add a really nice proc and top notch stat allocation .. and here you go .. legendary, that will be replaced in 1st Cataclysm raid, because gear scales exponentially in WoW.</div></div><hr />

i dont think i will want to do arena in S8 just because of that legendary axe...<br />
<br />
it will suck...<br />
<br />
<br />
at least, arena at like 2300+, cause only the people that are that good will be the ones with it. <br />
<br />
But yeah look at that shit, that damage cap is HUGE, its like 300 more than an epic! the minimum is as high as the caps on 232 ony weapons lol<br />
I'm seriously cringing thinking about how large of mortal and crusader strikes I'm going to take with this thing. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
See, why couldnt the healing mace be that legendary.<br />
<br />
<br />
cause good healers are already raid bosses by themselves, they don't need anything more legendary than a bunch of extra spellpower and the nifty lil shield proc. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
I'd say that 99% of everyone that gets this will pvp. Most of the top end guilds that will even get it also arena, and obviously the epeener dps's that will get this can't wait to stroke this thing in Ruins of Lordaeron.</div></div><hr />

The likelihood that you're going to face someone in PvP holding that axe is pretty low - first off, only hardcore PvE players are getting it. Second, the amount of resilience and damage in the max-tier season gear in 3.3 will almost certainly be at least comparable. Also remember that the proc won't work in arena, doesn't do anything to humanoids. Yes, the top end damage is high, but it's not like everybody with enough honor and arena rating is going to be able to snag it. A teensy, miniscule % of the population will have it. There's nothing unbalanced about it - it's as legendary as a legendary should be.<br />
<br />
<br />
The proc was changed to work on anything, it is no longer demon/undead limited.<br />
<br />
However, the weapon damage is already insane. For example, you have to take account on how much warrior damage is reliant on it, and then how the class that doesn't wear plate will take when that warrior bladestorm things. (Not QQing though, I just couldn't imagine how epic it will be to get bladestormed while seeing that glowing axe.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, they are completely in line with what Val'anyr ... well ... was.<br />
<br />
Val'anyr is half tier above Ulduar25 heroic loot. It has stats equivalent to epic weapon of ilvl245 + really nice proc.<br />
<br />
Shadowmourne is half tier above ICC heroic loot and has stats in line of what epic ilvl284 2H should have.<br />
<br />
Some math .. 1 tier = ~12% better stats (ok prolly an overstatement). Shadow's Edge has 297 base dps and is ilvl 264. 297 * 1.12^(1.5) = 348 base dps .. which is actually a little more than what Shadowmourne has.<br />
<br />
Now add a really nice proc and top notch stat allocation .. and here you go .. legendary, that will be replaced in 1st Cataclysm raid, because gear scales exponentially in WoW.<br />
<br />
Yeah, that's nice and all, but unfortunately it seems you've only been playing this game for a day. Val'anyr was 245 AFTER ToC came out. When it was released items like Contellus rivaled its stats.<br />
<br />
Then when Val was buffed to 245, weapons from Anub rivaled its stats (actually scratch that, they're better). Not to mention Shadowmourne's proc will work flawlessly and I guarantee the stats are going to stay like this.<br />
<br />
I just love how all the healers cried Shadowmourne would be infinitely better than Val and others said &quot;No, Val'anyr is the new face of legendaries.&quot; Faggots...</div></div><hr />

That's what they said about Val'anyr. Now you see guilds with four active raiders with them. Wait a second, my guild - one who doesn't even have Insanity yet - has four.<br />

<br />
I was granted Shadowmourne on the PTR and I have to say, even though you guys are geeking out over the stats, nothing you say or show can do Shadowmourne true justice.<br />
<br />
While fighting and building soul charges (which happen quickly) you slowly start to gain a ... &quot;soul aura&quot; around your character. From 1-4 charges you can see faint souls surrounding your character (they look like the Warlock Drain Soul). After 5+ charges, the effect is MUCH more visible.<br />
<br />
After gaining 10 charges and &quot;discharging&quot;, there is a slight darkening effect and a soul wailing noise. Too epic for words.<br />
<br />
Oh yeah, and &quot;SS OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN!&quot;. If Boub wants to get ahold of me I can upload some screenshots or something for him to host.<br />
<br />
Unfortunately, the GMs decided that the PTR was getting too crazy and took it away. It was either that, or because of this post and it's public attention. Oh well, all good things must come to an end. :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
im thinking heroic Shadows-Edge+360 strength &gt;Shadowmourne...<br />
<br />
i mean since the 10th stack of Soul Fragments will hit the boss for about 2k dmg, but at the same time remove the +360 (400?) strength, and start u back at +40 strenth at next proc....<br />
<br />
ofc, blizz might make this so that the Soul Fragments are &quot;captured&quot; by the weapon so that the +360 strength buff is directly connected to the weapon, so that if u remove the weapon the buff disapires...<br />
<br />
if so the hole Soul Fragment equip effect is in reality (evend out over the boss fight) a &quot;constant&quot; buff of +200 strength with a 2k bolt now and then on the boss...<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
EDIT: if this weapon has the same &quot;assemble yourself&quot; thing to it like the uldaur mace or the naxx40 staff, then im thinking this weapon will be just like the naxx staff, ppl will start to get it just in time to use it for there 80-85 lvling... so they will prob save them self getting the first tier of epic weapons in cataclysm, but as soon as next tier of weapon comes out its gona end up in the bank collecting dust..</div></div><hr />

Talking out of your arse isnt being productive. You have 24.5k health, 90% of that is 22.05k. In a charge stun which lasts 1.5 secs, you went to 25% or 6.125k. So in 1.5 secs, the warrior (1.5 sec GCD) either hit you with MS for ~18k or Overpowered you for ~18k. He could have charged you and then used Bladestorm where 2 ticks would have hit for 9k each. Where a bib, it will help with the dribble.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This weapon CANNOT be allowed in competitive pvp. It's COMPLETELY unbalanced for that. Val'anyr was a legendary that was on par with other hard mode loot, didn't have sockets, and had a random proc. Shadowmourne has perfect sockets, about an average of 180 extra strength, and is by far the highest top damage weapon in the expansion. A warrior bladestorming that axe will be able to rip apart a full pvp geared holy pally every cooldown.<br />
<br />
I HOPE, for the sake of the arena season, that when in an arena or BG the item will &quot;degrade&quot; to Shadow's Edge, with the old gems and enchants it had before being turned into the legendary. Making it a strictly PvE item.<br />
<br />
Another solution would be to only make it equipable in ICC.</div></div><hr />

Warriors easily get off 2 GCDs and a white hit with every charge/intercept before you can do anything.<br />

Player who will get this axe will be almost done with ICC I presume, so making it usable only in ICC is kinda stupid if you ask me.<br />
Also the 40 str procs won't be as easy to get in arena as they will be hitting on a static boss.<br />
And like someone stated earlier, with PvP gear it won't hit as hard evidently.<br />
At last, not everybody will have it, and maybe the few players who have this weapon won't be the top arena players.<br />
ONE legendary weapon won't make arena unbalanced... (at least no more than they already are)</div></div><hr />

All the strength is.. is.. droolifying. On top of that, the 3 Strength sockets with strength socketbonus. And on top of that again, stacks strength till it bams out some damage!

<br />
How does one simultaneously got Shadow's Edge and Shadowmourne? You turn Shadow's Edge into Shadowmourne. Unless you somehow hack it to get the quest chain reset after getting shadowmourne, there's no way get both.<br />

<br />
<br />
I don't think there's currently much debate about whether or not Shadowmourne has an &quot;assemble yourself&quot; thing. We can't really say at this point what the situation is going to be in terms of cataclysm gear, because every piece of gear in the game is being reworked to fit the new mechanics, everyone's talents are being shuffled around, and we have no idea how serious the gear reset is going to be in terms of changes to the rating coefficients. That said, it's likely not going to be best-in-slot for T11 in Cataclysm or anything. But I don't know why you're assuming people aren't going to get the weapon until near Cataclysm launch. That launch could well be 7-8 months after 3.3, and unless the Shadow Frost Shard drop rate is really low, there's no reason people couldn't have it with 2+ months to spare.</div></div><hr />

if the choas bane thing scales with stats then it'll be even better but i don't think it will.<br />

The +strength socket bonus is pretty negligible. Don't get me wrong, every bit helps, but...considering the laughably abundant and accessible strength from the proc, I wouldn't even care if it was a completely useless socket bonus like +3 Spirit. Done and done.<br />

The point is following in Arthas' footsteps, up to the point of aquiring a potentially dangerous (to ourselves) runeblade.

I wish I had an 80 DK, or Paladin, or Warrior... I doubt anyone on my server gets it, but I know people in my battlegroup will get it. I;e People from Korgath and the like.<br />

As soon as Shadowmournes start popping up in my battlegroup, I'm done pvping. I will run with my tail between my legs, crying and screaming like a little bady, hoping I'm not a victim for a 10k Crusader Strike, or 10k Mortal Strike... Sorry Death Knights, your strikes don't seem as potent as those 2 to me. And luckily, I don't arena, so I don't have to worry about getting my ass handed to me there with it.<br />

In BC the difference between Kz weapons and SW was only 148.7 - 114.0 = 26.5<br />
<br />
<br />
You should do that math in percentage, not in absolute numbers.<br />
<br />
26.5/114 = 0,232<br />
157.6/186.5=0.845<br />
<br />
The upgrade in BC was 23.2% while in wotlk it's 84.5%. SICK!</div></div><hr />

What the hell blizz? Keep feeding your beloved babies with new shiny toys are ye? Why couldnt you make it spear instead and add druids in the list? Because you will never make feral legendary, ever, dont try to fool us - you only true to yourself about &quot;1spec of 1 class&quot; when it comes to healing plate which you shove down our thorats even in heroic drops - get your [Gauntles of the Thunder God] and shove it up your *<br />

I play wow since its release and its sad to see so many Melee oriented legendary wpns in contrary to caster ones. So far we got a Healer mace from Uld and in Vanilla it was Atiesh, which in all fairness was legendary just to get the mats for(same as TF/Sulfuras), but due to the lack of time the raiders got to spend in Naxx40, only a rly small amount of players got one. But when you look on melee over the last few years, there is alot of them running round with TF/Illipants glaives.<br />
I know a new caster legendary is looming over the horizon at the start of Cataclysm, but that makes you wonder. If it comes out early in Cata, it will prolly suck stats-wise, cause on the contrary to other legendaries, it wont be the end-game content wpn (I hope blizz will sort this so the caster community can celebrate for once more). And yes, as some1 posted above, we sure as hell need a legendary polearm sometime in future, so all classes can say there is a legendary fit for them in this game. But hey, we still have like 2 major content patches after Cata comes out, so no1 ever knows what mysterious weapons will be unfold from the dephts of the world or twisting nether. :o<br />

To add to your orgasmic visions, I must remind you that the last bosses in raid instances are always slightly above all other bosses in item level loot. And they usually drop weapons. So what was Standard item level on heroic encounters, is Arthas's normal drops item level (give or take). And then you have the ilevel boost from the encounter being heroic....<br />
<br />
Wait, does that mean two 284s?</div></div><hr />

Then I can see a lot more QQ from the Cloth Classes. A Fury with Shadowmourne and a 284er 2hander would be really badass. They would probably just onehit every clothie.<br />

I hope this serves as an object lesson to those who deliver double-barreled whining the moment anything is datamined and revealed, however incomplete that data might be... By all means QQ once the very final stats of an item are revealed in Live, but I thought it was laughable yesterday looking at all the bitching from people about the proc before they'd even seen the stats of the thing, and now the whole picture is clear there's suddenly 15 pages of 'gief now plx!' <br />
<br />
And I know, I know, now I'm coming across as a whiny bitch, but seriously, these boards would be a lot more pleasant to surf through if people just took a deep breath and popped a Valium before posting...</div></div><hr />
