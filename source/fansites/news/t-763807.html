<br />
All casters i've seen are doing 14-18k on target dummies. The best i've seen a hunter do is around 11k (and it was me), other hunters i've tested with aren't even breaking 8k. Given my rotation isn't 100% solid on the PTR, these changes seem to be the opposite of what I expected.<br />

All casters i've seen are doing 14-18k on target dummies. The best i've seen a hunter do is around 11k (and it was me), other hunters i've tested with aren't even breaking 8k. Given my rotation isn't 100% solid on the PTR, these changes seem to be the opposite of what I expected.<br />

Yeah, BM hunters are tearing everything apart, but the other two hunter specs are barely able to keep their heads above water, especially with so much stuff requiring you to be in melee range.<br />

I get the whole arcane nerf i really do, as well as Bite/Claw etc. Considering it did like 30k+ crits with high mastery. But come on buff explosive shot for the love of god. with +50% elemental dmg AND 9,000 RAP the best crits i've seen is 3.7k per tick. If all 3 crit thats like 11.1k dmg for 44 focus. Hardly worth the focus spent when i can shoot for the same cost arcane shot twice for 20k dmg. Maybe explosive will be on par with arcane shot dmg now. Still doesn't make our &quot;signature&quot; move any good. Maybe when LnL procs MAYBE. You would think that after months of beta testing and now weeks of ptr testing they would get ontop of the explosive shot problem where no hunter in their right mind even has it on their action bars. BM is becoming the ONLY spec to play and it pisses me off. Another issue is KC dmg will be SO high that your pet will pull aggro everytime and die. This means boss fight goes like this: &quot;MD... oh wait MD doesn't make your pet dmg transfer, KC pet aggroes 1 shot dead, spend 35 focus ressing, KC another 40k+ crit pet pulls dies, res again. repeat till boss is dead&quot;. wow how absolutely boring. GG Blizz really.<br />
Edit: in before yes i know dmg can be modified, but wow its been long people and thats why im frustrated.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this was done to offset the nerf that Arcane shot got (19% to 4% RAP) and the nerf to pets special attacks (14% to 7% RAP)<br />
While I do believe rebuffing KC was a nice offset for the other 2 nerfs, I think it might have been better off @ 50%. But meh, its all still in testing. one things for sure, spamming only arcane shot won't be better DPS anymore for BM. Back to an interesting rotation!</div></div><hr />

Depends on what side you play. If you're a night elf, you can shadowmeld and use flight form to get out of combat, so I don't care how inconvenienced you are.<br />

Oh, right, so avoiding becoming a free honor kill justifies something completely broken? I'm okay with it in any other form but our flight form. If we can't root or sheep anyone on a flying mount, it wouldn't be fair to do that to druids.</div></div><hr />

Mage/Shaman polymorphs me. Assuming the nerf applies to shifting out of polymorph as well, I wait until it ends.

Actually, I'd say that really good warriors are amazing to see. Yes, there's certain aspects that make so-so players more effective than they probably should be (brostorm, etc), but top players definitely stand out from the pack.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Do you like pulling numbers out of the air? <br />
<br />
I just tested Survival out on my ICC25 geared (some 277, most 264) hunter on Beta (same as PTR, except I can fly)<br />
RAP: 6745<br />
Crit: 67.48%<br />
Mastery: 11.92 (+29%... less than your 50%)<br />
<br />
On a lv81 mob:<br />
4320 Fire damage from Explosive Shot (Critical)<br />
4229 Fire damage from Explosive Shot (Critical)<br />
4319 Fire damage from Explosive Shot (Critical)<br />
<br />
Level 85 premade hunter with terrible gear and no enchants:<br />
RAP: 4788<br />
Crit: 17.23%<br />
Mastery: 13.33<br />
<br />
On a level 85 mob:<br />
3795 Fire damage from Explosive Shot (Critical)<br />
2140 Fire damage from Explosive Shot<br />
2127 Fire damage from Explosive Shot<br />
<br />
So if I had 9000 RAP, 50% Mastery like you claim to have I would be probably hitting near 10k crits per tick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Don't worry, this is a classic Blizzard bait-and-switch, whereby they introduce a change that gets everyone riled up (e.g., no feral immunity to poly), and then &quot;give in&quot; to what they really wanted all along. In this case, that would be leaving us immune while in forms, but if caught in caster, we can't shift out of poly. The intent is simply to deal with the problem of resto druids being able to nullify mage's cc.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All casters i've seen are doing 14-18k on target dummies. The best i've seen a hunter do is around 11k (and it was me), other hunters i've tested with aren't even breaking 8k. Given my rotation isn't 100% solid on the PTR, these changes seem to be the opposite of what I expected.<br />
<br />
Casters damage increased, hunter damage decrease. When casters were already doing more than hunters on the PTR. /confused<br />
<br />
They most certainly are NOT doing 14-18k on dummies. Locks had a couple bugs in Aff and Destro that upped their damage a good bit... Having run a LOT of Normal and Heroic Dungeons already... Hunters are ranking top of meters with Locks... the remaining caster classes doign 7-8k.. sometimes up wards of 10k...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gosh.. get that stupid &quot;cleanse magick&quot; back but dont touch our class-defining strengths like poly immunity. A shitstorm is coming, i can see that.. F*ck that healing seriously.. It's been screwing up the entire class like a plague since vanilla beta. Like they took Play Dead away and gave it to hunters, because &quot;healer that can drop aggro is op&quot;. Screw healbots, really. Honestly, healing is only 1/4th of the class now, why should the rest of 3/4 of the class suffer because of it?<br />
<br />
I think it's funny that druids who have been king of the hill for healing in arenas for the last 3 seasons easily are all of the sudden crying over a change that was announced 1-2 months ago. It'll be great to finally be able to have my polymorph be useful against a druid. Besides, all healing classes got the revamp of getting either offensive or defensive dispels, getting that and keeping poly immunity would have just been el oh el.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Really glad the devs did that. Everything will get evened out in the end so we'll do the same damage as if we had that other 10%, but now I won't go from 1st to 7th on the meter just because our enhancement shaman decided to take a night off.</div></div><hr />

That may be, but it is more absurd to have a frost DK give the exact same buff as a resto shaman.

and finally pummel in battle stance &lt;3 pity that wars overall are punchbags and will be until gc doesnt fix rage generation which he screwed up yet again.<br />

also druid change ftw, they should also remove root and slow removal on changing for for ferals. It was needed back in vanilla when ferals had no dmg or slow. But now they have distance closer, stun AND slow to keep up with their enemies. Cant see a reason why they should be able to remove all roots and slows and at the same time get their whole enrgy back thx to furor. It's like warrior being able to remove roots and slows on every stance change.... Hell he would even pay for it more as he cant keep 100 rage on stance change unlike druid with energy.</div></div><hr />

Mage/Shaman polymorphs me. Assuming the nerf applies to shifting out of polymorph as well, I wait until it ends.

He morphs me again. I spend more mana than he spent again.<br />

How many casts of Cat Form before I run out of mana and can't do it again: Less than the number of polymorphs I can take before immunity sets in.<br />
<br />
Bottom line, polymorphing any other class doesn't leave them after the polymorph completely unable to do any moves without using a GCD on a form change. It's essentially as if Polymorph removed paladin blessings or seals.<br />

It's as if a mage polymorphing you, in addition to everything else it does, took away 20% of your base mana, and prevented you from doing anything except moving for one GCD after you popped out of it. You'd consider that an immense, OP buff to polymorph, right?<br />

Intended. If you look, all the other +20% ATKSPD buffs were also nerfed down to 10%. It's because Warrior and Rogue DPS is far too reliant on that buff to be competitive with other DPS classes. This will ultimately open up the ability to tweak their DPS numbers upwards.</div></div><hr />

* Enlightened Judgements now also Increases the range of your Judgement by 5/10 yards.<br />
* Divinity is gone, moved to Protection<br />
* Protector of the Innocent is now a Tier 1 Holy Talent and has been revamped - Casting a targeted heal on any target, including yourself, also heals you for 1240.83 to 1427.62. (Multi ranks, but currently all with the same value)<br />

<br />
Protection<br />
<br />
* Divinity is now a Tier 1 Protection talent.<br />
* Protector of the Innocent is gone, moved to Holy.<br />
* Guarded by the Light additional effect - In addition, your Word of Glory will also cause Holy Shield.<br />
* Judgements of the Just now also reduces ranged attack speed.<br />
<br />
<br />
Retribution<br />
<br />
* Crusader Strike now causes 120% weapon damage, up from 100%.<br />
* Selfless Healer now increases the effectiveness of Word of Glory's heal by 25/50% when used on others.<br />
* The Art of War now causes 100% additional damage, up from 30%.<br />
<br />
I'm liking these changes. Holy has access to a 40 yard judgement and chances are it will be much harder to kill them now.<br />
<br />
Prot gets a + healing taken talent which they probably would have taken anyway, Guarded by the Life gives us a choice between a damage and healing ability to proc Holy Shield, and reduced ranged attack speed is always nice.<br />
<br />
Ret just gets buffed damage all around, which is good from the sound of things before.</div></div><hr />

People complaining about BM being &quot;the spec to be&quot;. I agree kind of, if you have gotten so used to playing SV/MM. But tbh this is kind of to be expected. Since BM is THE pet spec for hunters, and blizzard putting so much emphasis on pets in cata ( Damage output, BM mastery, Pet buffs ) it seems clear that BM is going to outshine the other specs.<br />
<br />
This forces most hunters into that one spec, and I don't know if you have checked the talent tree for BM, but you can basically have ANY talent you want, with nothing missing, dip some into the MM tree and your set. We will see what happens though will it be any good after levelling? Time will tell.<br />
<br />
Oh and rogues. I don't play one. I am not a big fan of your class. But I have to say blizzards almost ignorance of how they are at the moment is kind of worrying ( Buddy of mine plays one ) Maybe all that QQ on forums is having a negative effect?..Who knows.

Here's druid PvP from now on:<br />
<br />
Mage/Shaman polymorphs me. Assuming the nerf applies to shifting out of polymorph as well, I wait until it ends. I spend more mana shifting back into my form (which is essentially required for all types of druid in order to actually use core abilities) than the mage/shaman spend polymorphing me.<br />
<br />
He morphs me again. I spend more mana than he spent again.<br />
<br />
Repeat until I'm out of mana and he really isn't.<br />

Drives me nuts reading the forums, looking for good information, and all I see are people posting that their class isn't getting changes, or what have you...<br />

<br />
Games not out yet, still in Beta/PTR. Complain when the patch goes live and there are no changes to your class and you are in the shadow of other classes!<br />
<br />
Rogues have had few changes in YEARS. Any change has been a minor tweak if anything. The new xpac comes and we get another cooldown to deal with, the ability to heal, and a smoke bomb.<br />

Depending on the class, it isn't too bad to get exalted with Zandalar. I can solo the place as Ret. It took me about 3 and 1/2 full clears grabbing all the bijous and coins I could find. Those runs took about 2 hours. I'm also an engineer so I had the luxury of being able to sell other crap I was picking up along the way. And mail stuff as needed.<br />

But if you can't solo it then yeah it would definitely be harder to deal get.</div></div><hr />

KC still hits insanly hard. Highest crit I got was 33k. With KC -&gt; Steady -&gt; Arcane -&gt; Steady, I am now doing even more Damage as BM as yesterday. (about 9k dps without CDs, where around 6k+ come from my pet). As long as the Pet lives and is able to attack, this really needs adjustment, whereas MM got hit pretty hard in comparison to BM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before this patch, the idea of &quot;run out every 30 seconds on bossfights to FC in and get Ravages&quot; was considered, but ruled out because the loss of white hits was too costly, and it consumed all your energy. Now the Ravages will cost no energy, the window will be 10 seconds, and be +50% crit for the first 20% of boss health. Bear in mind the DPE of Ravage compared to Shred and Rake is much better in Beta compared to Live.<br />
<br />
Looking at pvp, FC can be used while stealthed and doesn't break stealth. So with this change the amount of hurt we can dish out on someone unprepared is a lot higher . 10 seconds is time enough to Maim, reposition, and lay on a few more -- and at the end of our opening sequence we have a full energy bar. <br />
<br />
Skull Bash: talentable to 10 second CD, range now buffed from 0-8 yards to 0-13. Every 30 seconds, Skull Bash someone you're not focusing on, FC back and Ravagespam.<br />
<br />
<br />
I know the talent makes Ravage not require stealth. My point is that if someone sees you Feral Charge in, they are forewarned that a lot of hurt is coming and can counter.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, those buffs are nice, though more PvE-wise than PvP, Ravage still is a position-dependent move, even Maim doesn't guarantee it. And all of that doesn't make up for the psychological disaster of losing sheep immunity.</div></div><hr />

Last time I checked we had to be shapeshifted to be inmune to poly. And we can't dispel anything while in forms...<br />

Considering Mortal Strike only reduces healing by 25% now I don't think it is unreasonable for PVP. Fury Warriors and Rogues can also apply a healing debuff and have an interrupt so I'm not sure what would be wrong with the Arms warrior getting the interrupt as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The nerf was very much needed (At least to the party anyways). Because haste now effects resources, it became too powerful of a buff in relation to other buffs. In turn this would require fights to be balanced against a strong buff such as this, and would require an individual in the raid who could provide the buff.</div></div><hr />

Really Ghostcrawler is boring me to tears. The idea to have core abilities as level 10 is neat, but who knows if it might work to hold new players interest. Some of those core abilities are old and not very exciting at all as well imo. <br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zadoc</div><div class="date">2010-09-24, 05:02 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">At the start of this, Blizz said they wanted hunters to be more interesting, and to have to work at their shot rotations to optimise output with a small focus pool rather than the old mana system, with talents there to add flavour and customisation. So far as I can tell, Huntering now seems to consist of pointing your pet at the mob, hitting attack and watching the auto shots fire. Maybe with an occasional frost/ice trap to CC. Talents are now even more boilerplate+faceroll selection.<br />
<br />
I may be way off the mark with this, as I only have a PTR toon not beta, but I watch an unhealthy amount of beta videos, and this is how it feels to me. Before the makeover, huntering felt fine as it was. Okay, BM needed a boost, but it was still a very usable levelling spec, with SV and (especially) MM somewhere around 3rd best raid DPS, with good utility in terms of tranq, misdirect and so on. As of this week, Blizz seem to be hitting the development endgame, with bugfixes, and spec tweaks here and there for most specs. Right now, huntering feels very broken indeed. Not just at the lets-tweak-shot-damage level, but at a meta level above that. <br />
<br />
Still, beta is beta, and it is all about working out what works and what doesn't. They can sandpaper and polish the system all they like, but I hope Blizz are brave enough to see when something is fundamentally not working and needs a total rethink.</div></div><hr />

All casters i've seen are doing 14-18k on target dummies. The best i've seen a hunter do is around 11k (and it was me), other hunters i've tested with aren't even breaking 8k. Given my rotation isn't 100% solid on the PTR, these changes seem to be the opposite of what I expected.<br />

<br />
it's not a 100% chance of getting threat, it increases your threat generated by attacks by 100%. I heard warrior threat was a big issue in the beta so this is probably a needed change.<br />
<br />
p.s. LETS SEE SOME NEW NIGHT ELF RACIALS! We've got sick ones for tanking, but I'm a rogue! I guess our increased agility already gives us more dps than other rogues though.<br />

<br />
don't be silly target dummies are rarely reflective of what damage will look like in raids. When rogues were doing retartedly high dps, before HfB got nerfed from 18% damage increase to 8% damage increase. Remember, when ICC was first released? They were probably one of the lowest dps classes when it came to dummy damage. It's just how shit goes, some classes get a lot more benefit from buffs than others, wait til you're in a raid to complain.<br />

new skill: poisons (what? we already have poisons.);<br />
graphic changes or small changes;<br />
nothing, sorry<br />

Plus despite not having changes this patch, I'm just happy our rotation might actually take a slight bit of skill in cataclysm. No more mut mut envenom, mut mut envenom, making bad rogues look only slightly worse than good ones that know how to watch their envenom buff.</div></div><hr />

It's essentially as if Polymorph removed paladin blessings or seals.<br />
<br />
It's as if a mage polymorphing you, in addition to everything else it does, took away 20% of your base mana, and prevented you from doing anything except moving for one GCD after you popped out of it. You'd consider that an immense, OP buff to polymorph, right?<br />
<br />
That's what it is against druids, now.<br />
<br />
Im sure its worse... MUCH worse for paladins than for you my friend, even if polly worked on forms (which it looks like isn't the case) it would still be less of a headache for you than for any paladin out there, prot ret or holy.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zaerix</div><div class="date">2010-09-24, 08:10 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I really like how they're giving Prot a choice between Word of Glory, Inquisition, and Shield of the Righteous. Based on the situation, you'd probably only use SotR or Inquisition for your Holy Power dump since the Word of Glory talents basically made it useless for anything but dungeons (And I wouldn't expect a serious tank to be in dungeons 100% of his tanking career.). Now it gives us the ability to choose between healing and a light absorb shield, an ability that does a nice amount of damage, or a raw temporary boost to all damage you do and still get a core talent to proc on any.<br />
<br />
Also, can anyone tell me if Protector of the Innocent procs of Word of Glory heals? I know it's currently the same value, but when they fix it, it might be decent to take as Prot to add another 3k+ self healing onto your Word of Glory, even if the extra healing doesn't carry over to the shield. Healer mana looks, comparatively, like hell currently from what I've seen so helping out might be nice.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Azrile</div><div class="date">2010-09-24, 08:15 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Just want to point out that they still have not begun to balance DPS damage across different specs or classes. These changes, like most in the previous patches are merely there in order to get people to use the 'appropriate' rotation. <br />
<br />
For instance, if a spec has a spell that is way out of whack (either high or low) than the player on the PTR will change their rotation based on the damage of that ability. What this means is the desired 'rotation' is no longer being tested.<br />
<br />
Rogues have not seen any changes because most of their rotations are working fine. Yes, damage is low, but we are pushing the buttons we are supposed to be pushing. Other classes (hunters for example) still don't have their rotations working the way the devs want them. The drastic changes in ability damage is not to 'buff BM hunters'.. it is to buff an ability so that BM hunters actually use it in their rotations on the PTR the way the devs want.<br />
<br />
DO NOT compare your overall DPS to that of other classes. Do NOT compare your DPS to that of other specs. Instead, work on your rotation on the PTR and make sure the abilities 'make sense' for the amount of damage they do. That is all the devs are working on right now.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Duster505</div><div class="date">2010-09-24, 08:31 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Im really baffled what BLizzard is doing with Holy palas atm. We have been told that there is less need for using every GCD to heal cause ppl will have more HP pools.... Still - all that holy talent tree is offering atm is increasing haste on spells and removing GCD of some spells if some buffs are up... IF not .. they dont...<br />
<br />
I dont see the point of removing GCDs on stuff if you have time to heal ppl up.. To me its a total waste and will lead to the spec getting OOM extra fast.<br />
<br />
I very much know WHY they are doing this ... Because yet again the Group healing abiltes in 5 man dungeons are NOT good enough with the two new AOE spells... THey both have long cd and require certain VERY specific situations to work properly... <br />
<br />
I think more and more holy palas are getting worried about Cataclysm. Im personally going to reroll a priest Gnome cause I really dont see the point of playing Holy palas any more. So limited tools to work with ..... Either your uber ... or you are CRAP... Just ONE single fight where a healing class is crap means Blizzard has FAILED to deliver on the new healing system. There are many reports showing HUGE issues in 5 man healing instances atm as holy. SO bad that at least two of my good friends that are holy palas are not gonna bother even going there again as holy. <br />
<br />
Something has to be done in next few builds to correct the huge situatinal only uses of Holy pala group spells... If not then why even use them on the long cd at all if they can only be used in every other encounter in the game for them to work effectively... Thats the case atm.</div></div><hr />

Really Ghostcrawler is boring me to tears. The idea to have core abilities as level 10 is neat, but who knows if it might work to hold new players interest. Some of those core abilities are old and not very exciting at all as well imo.<br />
<br />
It will hold their interest before getting those core abilities by 40 &amp; 50. Leveling will be a lot more fun with core abilities. You will feel like your class at level 10 instead of (like I said) 40 &amp; 50. I really don't think WoW has a problem holding the interest of new players, I think it's to hold the interest of returning players who want to level new characters. Leveling is half the game and the max level is the other half.<br />

<br />
So lets see what that did, keeping in mind that AP is no longer found on gear/gems/enchants... Hunter has 2000 Agi (reasonable number at lvl 80) Hits the BM tab to get his 15% increase AP... Oh great, that meens they have 2000 Agi and 4600 AP. But wait, that hunter wants to go Survival instead. Here comes the 15% Agi to put that same hunter at 2300 Agi and oh look, 4600 AP. Hmm, with more attacks being based off AP, looks like BM hunters available shots do the EXACT same as Survival BUT do not benifit from the added crit from agility. <br />
<br />
Right off the bat, Survival is more powerfull then BM. <br />
<br />
I keep reading that &quot;numbers are easy to tweek&quot; and yes, they are, but really, i'm no math major and can see by a single click of a mouse button, one spec has a massive benifit over the other.</div></div><hr />
