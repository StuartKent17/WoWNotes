<br />
[anchor=brewfest]Brewfest guide (October 3 - October 16) (Alliance/Horde perspective)<br />
Now this is ram racing ... Almost (Ram Tutorial)<br />
The first quest you will get is a tutorial on how to use a racing ram. You will need ram racing reins (from the apprentice next to the quest giver) to speed up with your mount, you can consider your speed like an energy bar that you fill everytime you use the reins. Basically, everytime you switch to trot, using the reins 4 times will get you to the &quot;max&quot; level of canter, using it a 5th time will change it to a galop, and smashing the button like mad will eventually exhaust your mount (when your Ram Fatigue debuff reaches 100) and get you stuck in place for 15 seconds. You can also pass near apples buckets (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/apples.jpg) to remove the ram fatigue debuff, there is one next to the signs after the bridge and another one behind the guy you need to see in Kharanos.<br />
<br />
Daily Quest - There and Back Again<br />
Reward : 10 tickets the first time, then 2 tickets for each keg delivered. (You can only do it once a day and you still have the 4 minutes limit, however you will get extra time everytime you deliver a keg and you can get 20~25 tickets each day with a decent route)<br />
You need to get a keg from Flynn Firebrew in Kharanos (standing on a hill on the right of the road, next to the armory)/Bok Dropcertain (just follow the road to Razor Hills). Bring it back to the quest giver and do this 3 times, you can use the apples buckets to make it faster, but you can do without it.<br />
<br />
Did Someone Say, &quot;Souvenir?&quot;<br />
Reward : [item=32912] (Screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/reward_quest.jpg))<br />
Just give the voucher to Belibi Quickswitch (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/belbi.jpg)/Blix Fixwidget in the Brewfest camp.<br />
<br />
Daily quest - Bark for the Barleybrews!/Bark for the T'chali's Voodoo Brewery <br />
Reward : 15 Tickets<br />
Time Limit : 4 minutes<br />
You have to go to 4 flags (see screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/flags.jpg)) in the capital with your brewfest mount and pass near them at all 4 locations from your quest log and your character will automatically say something.<br />
<br />
Daily quest - Bark for the Thunderbrews!/Bark for the Drohn's Distillery<br />
Reward : 15 Tickets<br />
Time Limit : 4 minutes<br />
You have to go to 4 flags (see screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/flags.jpg)) in the capital with your brewfest mount and pass near the 4 flags in the locations given in your quest log. Your character will automatically say something.<br />
<br />
Catch the Wild Wolpertinger!<br />
Reward : [item=32233] (Screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/reward_wolpertinger.jpg), This pet is actually invisible to other players)<br />
The point here is to ... drink, drink, and drink again. Buy wine from the wine vendor (or anything else) and drink until you feel completely smashed. (The emotes will appear in this order : You feel tipsy &gt; You feel drunk &gt; You feel completely smashed). When you're smashed, you will be able to see the Wolpertinger for about 10 seconds, then they will disappear and you will have to drink again to make them reappear. (This is how they look like when you're very drunk (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/wolpertingerdrunk.jpg) (or like this (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/wolpertinger.jpg) if you don't have full screen glow activated)<br />
<br />
Pink Elekks on Parade (Same quest giver as &quot;Catch the Wild Wolpertinger!&quot; but I can't get it on all characters, maybe some strange prereqs ?)<br />
Reward : 40 Tickets<br />
Visit the beer gardens in Stormwind, Darnassus, the Exodar/Silvermoon, Thunder Bluff, Undercity (they're small camp at the entrance of each city, see example (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/stormwind.jpg)) and zap 3 Elekks at each location. You have to be drunk as well for this quest.<br />
<br />
Seek the Saboteurs<br />
Every hour, Dark Iron dwarves will attack the brewfest camp (Screenshot #1 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/diattack1.jpg), Screenshot #2 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/diattack2.jpg), Screenshot #3 (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/diattack3.jpg)), during the attack you can use Complimentary Brewfest Sampler in your inventory to throw them at the attackers, Belbi Quickswitch will give you a Brewfest Prize Ticket for each dwarf you knock down.<br />
After the attack, you will be able to get a quest from plans on the ground (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/sabotage.jpg). This quest requires you to go in Blackrock Depths (Grim Guzzler tavern) to find a guy. He roams in the room, behind the barrels most of the time, and will hide behind the plans seller (see screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/brd.jpg)) when you come too close. Just talk to him and you will get the [item=34140] (Screenshot (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/september/brewfest/reward_quest.jpg))<br />
<br />
Tickets rewards<br />
You can buy tons of things with tickets. All these items (including mounts and [item=33927]) will last after the events except the [item=33047] (Turns everyone into a gnome/orc depending on your faction. 7 Days duration). The &quot;Honorary Brewer&quot; hand stamp will let you buy [item=33976] and [item=33977] from the apprentice (10 gold for the normal mount, 100 gold for the epic one). You need 600 tickets for the mounts, 100 for the goggles. <br />
<br />
The mount is the same for horde players, and is permanent too.<br />
<br />

<br />
And this is why you want the goggles, badly. (Horde players will get a female orc transformation)<br />

<br />
I for sure got this quest from the Festival Grounds in front of Ironforge. Look to the left of the greeter NPC and you'll see a dwarf named Goldark Snipehunter. He gives the Pink Elekk's on Parade and the Catch the Wild Wolpertinger quests.<br />
