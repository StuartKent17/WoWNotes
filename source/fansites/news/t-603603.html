Q: Various posts about the job applications on Blizzard's website concerning a MMO, and how it could possibly be additional manpower for WotLK<br />
A: No, it is an unannounced Next-Gen MMO. And that doesn't mean an expansion for World of Warcraft either.<br />

Virus Alert<br />
And unfortunately for us, the “they” in this case are thieves, and they came. It appears that the people who are distributing the latest rash of trojans paid us a visit as well. We have determined that two of the mods on the site that have auto-installers were hacked and a trojan inserted. From our investigations, it appears that the incursion was on 30 Nov. Here are the details that you need to be aware of:<br />
<br />
If you downloaded either: &quot;KaoMod-20300.001.exe&quot; or &quot;SewellUI&quot; between 30 Nov and 02 Dec, you may have been infected. <br />
<br />
What you need to do<br />
If you downloaded either of those files and think you may have been infected follow the steps on WoWInterface.com forums (http://www.wowinterface.com/forums/showthread.php?threadid=13868)<br />

Mike Morhaime interview on IncGamers<br />
IncGamers interviewed Mike Morhaime (Blizzard CEO) to get more details on the Activision / Vivendi partnership. <br />
<br />
Q: Why Activision Blizzard and not Activision Vivendi?<br />
Blizzard Entertainment is arguably one of the strongest brands in the interactive entertainment industry. Like I mentioned, we are number one in PC and online in North America, Europe, and most of Asia outside of Japan, so I think it really makes sense with it being such a strong brand that it really deserves to be in the corporate name.<br />
<br />
Q: Are there going to be any structural changes at Blizzard at all? You have stated that there won't be any changes but are things going to change behind the scenes that the Blizzard fan base are not going to see or know about?<br />
I’ll tell you what, if I do my job properly, the players won't notice any difference.<br />
<br />
Q: Will Activision have any involvement with the day to say running of Blizzard at all?<br />
Not really. Activision is going to be focused on the Activision business. Blizzard will be focused on the Blizzard business, and of course we'll be talking to each other. I think there's a lot we can teach them about online games and certainly they run a very efficient company and I think there are things we can learn from them. <br />
<br />
Q: Is there going to be any impact on World of Warcraft subscribers? We've seen a few threads this evening with players concerned about the product/service quality slipping and concerns about the timely release of patches. Can you reassure the players that it's business as usual at Blizzard.<br />
The management structure of Blizzard is not changing. We've got the same people responsible for assuring quality. Our priorities have not changed. We're the same company we've always have been. We're just allying with experience and a very successful company that has strengths in other areas. Combined, we're a stronger company, but the Blizzard Entertainment brand is going to remain unchanged, as is the Blizzard operation. Blizzard fans should not be concerned.<br />

<br />
For a while I've held the belief that the only thing that can kill WoW is another Blizzard product. However, running two MMO's simultaneously spells disaster, insitgating competition between two of their own products (what's known as cannibalism). I don't think Blizzard has enough resources to develop or maintain two MMO's at the same time, unless they've done a lot of hiring under the radar.<br />
<br />
Might this mean WLK is the end of WoW?<br />
<br />
EDIT: I guess this is what we were calling project Hydra. (http://www.wowinsider.com/2007/09/11/blizzards-third-project-hydra/)</div></div><hr />

<br />
The fact it is an MMO doesn't mean it is an MMORPG. Personally I think it will be something completely different from wow =&gt; no cannibalization, or at least lesser one. And in the words of a intel person: better to cannibalize your products than having the competition doing it for you.<br />
<br />
Now, Blizzard is at a crossroad - merger with activision (&quot;it won't affect operations&quot;.. mmh take it with a grain of salt), Wow declining on the US and probably with some worrying development path until WOTLK and specialty MMORPGs coming into the market. Their playerbase is unrivaled and they must keep their shareholders happy - they surely have the resources to succeed.<br />
<br />
Now, they may create a new breed MMO focused on PVP, wide number pvp to be more precise, while WoW strengthens the PVE side. Or something completely different. Anyway, I don't believe WotLK to be the end of WoW.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Naah, as one of Blizzards managers said that no wow2 was in the workings.<br />
<br />
What we know is that it is a MMO and not WoW.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">the_nell_87</div><div class="date">2007-12-03, 10:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I'm pretty sure they wouldn't be working on WoW2 before WotLK is even released. And I'm also pretty sure they can't be working on a Starcraft MMO before Starcraft 2 is released. So the logical conclusion is either Diablo, or something new entirely. But I think Diablo is a little too similar to WoW, for them to make an MMO of it.<br />
So, my vote goes to something totally new!</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">LazeGamer</div><div class="date">2007-12-04, 01:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">They've said before that they were working on a new intellectual property, and my guess is that this will be it. It allows them to do whatever they want with this story, without balancing players actions versus the Lore. Also, with their merger with Activision and recent job postings for coders experienced with consoles, I anticipate the next MMO to be multi-platform, which doesn't bode well for it being an MMOFPS :(.<br />
<br />
As far as Hydra, Medusa, and them already working on SC2... didn't WC3 come out just before WoW? I'm sure they were developing WoW at the same time, so it's certainly possible that they are working on a Starcraft MMO.<br />
<br />
With the similarities to WoW and the loss of the original development team, I don't think we'll be seeing any MMO's in the Diablo storyline soon.</div></div><hr />

I'm 80% sure it's Diablo 3. And by MMO they might not say what you guys think they're saying. It might be Hellgate: Londong style. Majority of the game is offline but there's also a huge part for the guys that play online and subscribe. Special features and such. It gets both offline and online players hyped.</div></div><hr />
