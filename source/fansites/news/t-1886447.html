PvE<br />
valor being brought back for half the last tier of the expac really fails to capture why people enjoyed to begin with<br />
Just to make sure I understand the feedback/concern, what did you like most about Valor in the past? (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/656345931269279744))<br />
<br />
Can you only get valor for one heroic per day? Or can you spam until your gear is fully upgraded? People seem to think...<br />
It's just the first Heroic of the day. There's no completely spammable source of Valor. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/656602270801391617))<br />

I believe &quot;BCKSP&quot; is what the game uses internally and &quot;Backspace&quot; is the string for it so they have only forgot to add the string in the other place.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Normal players can, and will, get invites. While I imagine most of those who get it this early will be influencers, blizzard friends, and family, there will be some normal players, too. <br />
<br />
I won't lie about influencers/streamers being invited for the sake of more game exposure. It's pretty much a widely known fact. It's a mutually beneficial trade: Blizzard gets more exposure, and the influencers get more views/viewers. <br />
<br />
But don't let that discourage you from at least signing up for the beta. Stay positive, check your bnet app/emails once in a while.<br />

Wowhead and mmo-champion have tons of influence. As for your first comment:<br />
<br />
What negative things do they not post? <br />
Would those negative things be opinions, or factual? <br />
Do you really want mmo-champion to focus on negative things?<br />
Do you think posting negative things will bring the website more visitors and revenue?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overwatch is an objective-based arena shooter in the vein of Team Fortress, Unreal Tournament, and the like. It is not a military shooter, so it doesn't need a feature that a) fundamentally encourages hunkering and b) is only really necessary because the TTL/TTK in those games is so short that not having something that that drastically reduces your target profile would make it otherwise impossible to survive any kind of firefight.<br />
<br />
I'd be shocked if going prone ever made it into the game.<br />

You know, getting into alphas/betas isn't just about getting to play a game early. The people who consistently get into alphas/betas are the ones who actually make themselves valuable assets by actively testing things outside of the narrow band of common use cases and file detailed and helpful bug reports when they come across broken things. Those people get invited back time and time again, whereas anyone who doesn't have such a history of useful feedback is an unknown factor.</div></div><hr />

People who play from their couch, or are simply more comfortable with analog gamepad controls? Not everyone plays games to be super competitive, and there's nothing wrong with playing in a way that's comfortable to you if you're not concerned about being the best.<br />
<br />
(I'm perfectly happy with my gaming-grade keyboards and mice, but I don't see why it's so fashionable to make fun of people for wanting gamepad support. Live and let live, good sirs.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes.. I know what a beta test is and how it works.<br />
<br />
I'm asking(sarcasticly if that wasn't clear) if YET AGAIN social media(streamers and youtubers) get special treatment or will they allow regular people to actually test the beta aswel. Big difference as mostly the youtubers and streamers will do nothing more than make a few videos and that's it.</div></div><hr />

Beta is beta, it hopefully could change before launch. Also noticed some inconsistencies on the button names, on one screen backspace was labeled as BCKSP and others it was Backspace.<br />
<br />
Anyways, good luck to all!<br />
<br />
Knowing new games, you just slide it to the max and it's still too low.</div></div><hr />

Regular people will have to wait a little longer to get beta. That's how it has always been done.</div></div><hr />

Thats generally what the initial closed beta is for. Get a small group of high publicity members in, and a little while after that - do a wider scale beta.<br />
<br />
Most of the time if a company is doing a wide scale game beta immediately, its just to save on hardware testing costs - not to do collect any feedback as its far too late to implement any gameplay changes besides number tweaks.</div></div><hr />

I know right? Guild Wars 2 and Star Wars expansions launched this week, but a twitch shooter is on the front page instead of them.</div></div><hr />

I suspect it will be when the name is changed to Blizz-Champion.</div></div><hr />

I think most people that come here are interested in mmos and could give two shits about a shooter.</div></div><hr />

As awesome as it would be to get access to a beta I might actually play and test I'm fully expecting to not get an Overwatch invite.</div></div><hr />

Perhaps they can &quot;see&quot; that somehow and chose you for exactly that reason. They aren't making a CCG/MOBA to get all the people who are pro's at magic and league, they are trying to get all the people who don't already play and expand the market, grow the fanbase, just like they did with WoW.</div></div><hr />
