<br />
They seem to employ (more?) people now that just do random things in game that aren't current content that might be perceived as minor QoL stuff (old models, renaming stuff, etc). I've seen a lot of minor stuff like this from 7.3 onward. Or at least they're given more freedom to do whatever in their free time. Probably the latter, but yeah, wouldn't think much of it.</div></div><hr />

They both reference Battle of Dazar'alor which opens Jan 22nd. <br />
<br />
My understanding based on the comments in the Patch 8.1.5 PTR Developers Notes thread (sorry can't post links) and the fact that we're only two weeks away would be that this patch would be a while yet. Maybe a month or 2?<br />
<br />
Does Blizzard normally add in achievements to raids a month or so after the raid releases or should be expecting 8.1.5 on the 22nd?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah racials for Horde have always been better for raiding. <br />
But the same has been said for Alliance with the Human racial being broken for so many years.<br />
If you raid then Horde is best.<br />
If you PvP then Alliance is best because of the Humans having free trinket slots. It was a no brainer and the leader boards clearly showed this for both factions.<br />
It stayed broken for many many many FN years and Blizzard did nothing. And when they finally did do something they basically made it all worse. If you haven't been paying attention. Blizzard is VERY Horde biased in house. And they do very little to try and hide this. <br />
Also holding onto these allied races for this long and now of all times they are ready for release? lol convenient timing Actilizzard Moneygrubment!</div></div><hr />

Don’t think it’s specifically been mentioned. Blizz statedbthey are going to redirect focus back to the neck and have it function more like azerite weapons did where you unlock traits as you progress. Believe they also mentioned azerite armor was ending. Not sure if they will bring back tier sets or if there will just be stat pieces after.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except Horde had good racials as well for PvP...and them having a extra trinket slot was nerfed long ago...and it took from BC to BfA for them to finally nerf Arcane Torrent a bit.<br />
<br />
Undead had will of the forsaken as well, wasn't as good as every man for himself but it was still similar. Basically for everything the Alliance had in PvP, Horde had something not quite as good, but they had other areas where Alliance had nothing.<br />
<br />
Not going to go into all the details but Horde had plenty...</div></div><hr />

It's a VERY long time. It's been 5 months now(which is already a lot), add the time until 8.1.5 and you will have 7 months to deliver something to was used to hype the expansion, that everyone believed they would get within the first 1~2 months. Hell, even launch.</div></div><hr />

They already have Horde outnumbering Alliance to the point they have to provide big incentives to even turn your warmode on. How does this make it better? I'm guessing the Zandalari racials are going to get absolutely gutted due to the backlash.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They didn't nerf the traits by 50 %, so you will definitely still be way more powerful.<br />
<br />
Also, they didn't nerf the current worst traits, so it's also a way to bring all traits closer together in terms of performance.<br />
<br />
I'm in general very critical of the work Blizzard are doing with BFA. For me it's like buying a rain coat that doesn't keep the rain out. But this specific change, I think is going to be a good change. Just give it some time.</div></div><hr />

Yet Undead got other useful racial and Draenei got more then 4. Still, It'is quite obvious that that 100% healing is never going to happen. Or it is badly explained in the notes, or it is going to be &quot;nerfed&quot; saying that the overall of healing is just a 25%. And after all the criers flooding the forums, that will happen in one or two days, just like with everything the Alliance cries about, you'll see. Don't worry.<br />

But damn, these &quot;fat&quot; humans are ultra ugly, I could never play this<br />
<br />
Honestly, they sound more OP than they really are. <br />
<br />
Loa - at least the tank and crit one equate to about a 5% buff, but with only 20% uptime, which equates to about 1% overall impact, but obviously for 80% of the fight it has zero effect and sometimes it has a huge 5% impact. If that window falls during BL, it would be bigger than 1%-- closer to 1.5%. If it didn't proc at all during a window, then it would actually be worse than a flat 1% vers. The DPS effects seem to always be active with a much higher PPM, but they are still balanced to do only about 1% more damage (the bleed is about 0.33% damage, but stacks to 3)<br />
<br />
Regenerating - Seems super OP right now, but at least on PTR it doesnt work in dungeons, raids, BGs, or Arenas. It only works out of combat (between pulls), and it's channeled. If it's interrupted, then the CD isn't reduced but the effect is. Right now it doesn't work in arenas or BGs, but does work in world PvP which can be really OP. Polish someone off, stealth behind a wall as a kitty or rogue. Channel this. Other than world PvP-- which I think they may have to nerf-- it's just a nice quality of life thing. Replaces food in the open world. Of course that will change if it stays live for world PvP or they let you use it in raids or dungeons. <br />
<br />
Brush it off Right now it seems OP compared to Highmountain Tauren, but it's really not. Both races get 1% verse. 2% healing seems great. If you have 200k health and are hit by a tank buster for 50% of your health, then you'd heal for 2% of 100k over four seconds so you'd get a total heal of only 2k-- in other words, you would see a heal of only 500 health a second for four seconds AFTER a big tank buster. That's not going to make a huge impact just like Rugged Tenacity. Most hits would be much less than that and how it works on PTR is that if you are hit for 5k it will start the 4 second heal. If you are hit with a 100k hit while the heal is rolling, it won't reset. It will continuing to heal you for the smaller amount.</div></div><hr />

But the same has been said for Alliance with the Human racial being broken for so many years.<br />
If you raid then Horde is best.<br />
If you PvP then Alliance is best because of the Humans having free trinket slots. It was a no brainer and the leader boards clearly showed this for both factions.<br />
It stayed broken for many many many FN years and Blizzard did nothing. And when they finally did do something they basically made it all worse. If you haven't been paying attention. Blizzard is VERY Horde biased in house. And they do very little to try and hide this. <br />
Also holding onto these allied races for this long and now of all times they are ready for release? lol convenient timing Actilizzard Moneygrubment!<br />
<br />
Horde side is better for raiding only because the pool of skilled players on horde is larger. If you actually thought about it (granted, if you did that you would have one less thing to cry over), the ztroll racials arent nearly as overpowered as you want them to be.<br />
<br />
That said, i still cant wait to roll a [not just a reskin] kul tiran.</div></div><hr />

Why would you assume that? The wording is pretty clear.<br />
<br />
Far safer to assume it breaks on damage, can't be used in combat, or is extremely limited to where it can be used (ie. not arenas), or all of the above.</div></div><hr />

<br />
On PTR it's 100% right now and it feels pretty good, but there are huge limitations on it<br />
<br />
1) No BGs, no Arenas, no raids, no dungeons so it really only works in outdoor PvE and world PvP<br />
2) It doesn't work in combat. Can't even be clicked if combat is active, which is annoying, particularly when you get caught in combat or Bwonsamdi's ghost kicks you back into combat. That should mean that pallies can't use it in combat by bubbling, right or does bubble exit them from combat?<br />
3) It breaks Feign Death for hunters and stealth for rogues. I haven't tested it with pally bubble but I'd assume it doesn't dispell bubble. Breaking stealth/feign death doesn't interrupt the heal, but it makes you potentially vulnerable to interrupts. <br />
4) If it's interrupted, then the heal stops but CD remains down<br />
5) 4 seconds is a lot of time and it only heals at 1 second intervals unaffected by haste. If you heal and are interrupted 1.5 seconds later, you will get one tick, but not the second to you'd heal about 25%--around that of a potion). If you are interrupted 0.5 seconds later, nothing happens. <br />
<br />
Obviously there are situations that are concerning with it. Most of the time it will feel like a free meal-- cleared some quests and elites and heals you up a little faster than food will and for free (if people actually eat after fights in world content anymore with current gear level). In World PvP it could be fairly overpowered even for rogues who can stealth behind a wall and heal to full relatively quickly. Pallies could really benefit if they can get to 2%, bubble, and heal to full during the duration of their bubble.<br />

<br />
How does the Loa racial work exactly? Do you get to chose one and it stays till you change ?<br />
<br />
That is correct. You choose one, which is kinda cool, but may be a pain in the butt if you change specs. You essentially choose<br />
1) 5% runspeed<br />
2) a proc of 5% crit that is up 20% of the time<br />
3) a proc that will either grant you 5% extra HP or 5% extra armor. On average it is up about 20% of the time. It's the same ability so you can't proc both health and armor at the same time. <br />
4) A bleed that can proc on attacks that adds about 0.33% to your attacks that can stack up to three times to add about 1% of your overall damage in bleeds<br />
5) A proc on casts that does a free shadow damage attack and heals you for the same amount. With Uldir gear it hits for about 10k and heals for 10k, but it only has about 2 procs per minute. <br />
<br />
All of the abilities other than movement speed do scale (albeit poorly) with an appropriate stat to stay around 1% effective as you gear up and level, but the proc frequency is not impacted by haste. Bleed should always be up and takes little time to ramp up to three full stacks. Crit and Armor/HP are up about 20% of the time. The shadow damage one is about 2 procs per minute which makes for a nice increase in damage, but a small heal every 30 seconds is very random and hard to rely on. <br />
<br />
The actual spell on PTR is like a mage portal spell where you mouse over it and it expands to give you five options. Right now there is no CD on how often you can change the blessings.</div></div><hr />

They may lock them in M+ and raids. I haven't tested that. <br />
<br />
Plus, there's really just one for each spec. <br />
<br />
Tanks - take the armor/health oric<br />
Healers - take the 5% crit proc<br />
melee - take the bleed<br />
ranged- take the shadow bolt<br />

Blizz statedbthey are going to redirect focus back to the neck and have it function more like azerite weapons did where you unlock traits as you progress. Believe they also mentioned azerite armor was ending. Not sure if they will bring back tier sets or if there will just be stat pieces after.<br />
<br />
Need a source for this. Everything I've seen they've been extremely reluctant to fully admit that it is a terrible system and should be done away with, they only make small concessions about parts of it being bad, &quot;some traits are uninteresting&quot; etc. But I've yet to see them say anything about getting rid of it all together.</div></div><hr />

Azerite Armor after Battle of Dazar'alor will drop with all Traits unlocked. Artifact Power will unlock things in the Heart of Azeroth instead.<br />
from https://www.wowhead.com/news=289210/liveblog-of-the-dec-14th-battle-for-azeroth-q-a-with-ion-hazzikostas<br />
<br />
8.1 is the last time you will be earning traits toward Azerite pieces, which makes sense because 8.1 was being designed as they were polishing 8.0. 8.2 is the first patch they've been designing where development started after the public outcry over Azerite gear. Almost no big game company will admit that their game is &quot;terrible&quot; but Blizz, by backing away from almost every complaint about Azerite (respec cost, availability, earning traits, etc.) shows that they know that it's not good and they're working to replace it. <br />
<br />
They've been very vague about what will replace it-- perhaps for fear of backlash or perhaps because they're still developing ideas for a patch that probably won't land until June or July, but they have said that starting with 8.2, Azerite as we know it will end. In other interviews Ion has teased a system like our artifact weapons in Legion, but the one thing he has promised is that we will stop &quot;unlock[ing] traits&quot;<br />
<br />
Not saying that it will be a magic fix, but they've made dozens of small fixes so far and with more coming. I'm at least optimistic. Azerite vendors and currency now. Next raid will have multiple sources of azerite pieces starting with the very first boss so you wont be swearing at one boss who never drops your shoulder. 8.1 added more traits so higher likelihood of finding something good. Then 8.2 we'll stop having to grind to unlock stuff on gear we already earned.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Gotta give the people with no talent that you can't let go something to do. Or the interns. Or sense Ion stated they have no idea what everyone is doing and one hand doesn't talk to the other someone just did it to &quot;look busy&quot;. <br />
<br />
Just wild speculation on my part.</div></div><hr />

And finally, we unlock what are supposed to be the main selling point allied races of the expansion!<br />
<br />
Also, no update on the super skinny model? I want a super skinny mage with a long beard, damnit! Mages aren't supposed to have six packs! I mean, fat mages are cool too, but I want more customization options!<br />
<br />

Also just realized... what is the aesthetic difference between female Darkspear trolls and female Zandalari trolls?</div></div><hr />

Or there's content in Northrend that's being used in the patch, with Wintergrasp, so the art department is updating the maps? I mean, you're so pissy about the game you're making up stuff like this? &quot;People with no talent&quot;, really?</div></div><hr />

<br />
And people say they have no favoritism towards the Horde? Don't understand why the raiding scene is absolutely dominated by the Horde?<br />
<br />
More OP racials &quot;for the Horde.&quot;<br />
<br />
Judging by your comment you don't realize that the skinny Kul' Tiran human model was actually a skinny human, not just a normal human model. Skinny as in not a jacked up, hitting the gym every day model. Skinny as in actually a lanky human. <br />
<br />
As for the racials, yeah it's pathetic how the overpowered Zandalari racials even made it to beta, let alone probably going live (maybe with minor nerfs.)<br />
<br />
- 100% HP regen over 4 seconds on a 1 min 30 second CD.<br />
- A choice between buffs granting either an HP buff and armor buff for tanks, a stacking DoT, doing damage that also heals for 100% of the damage, 5% more crit, or 5% movement speed. <br />
<br />
Even by their usual Horde favoritism racials, there are just extremely overpowered.</div></div><hr />

For me its still the worst part of BFA, But the really annoying thing they were told so many times early beta<br />
it was a rotten replacement for the weapons. Heal blink of mages has already crept back something that should never have<br />
been removed in the first place. <br />
<br />
Had a chest item 390 yet the traits on a 370 were so much better</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because Blizzard is well known to not let things go out of beta without a fix, right?</div></div><hr />

is this a joke? those KT racials are absolute garbage compared to them.</div></div><hr />

these guys trash this game on sites and youtube. all them dont even play anymore. good. leave. 9/10 people i meet have been around since vanilla/TBC. people that like the game still. less complainers in trade.<br />
Classic will save this game. people that started back then will be on</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scoli</div><div class="date">2019-01-10, 04:23 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That Zandalari Regenerate racial can't go live. That's such a ridiculously strong racial for so many classes in pvp. A Survival hunter zandalari could feign death with the pvp talent that clears all dots and trap someone and heal to full safely. Could also use Mending Bandage or whatever the pvp talent is called to clear dots to allow him to heal to full. A mage zandalari can just sheep someone and shield themselves so they can heal to full. A paladin zandalari could literally bubble and heal themselves to full. A rogue could cloak and vanish and heal to full. It's literally a stronger Evocation heal that mages used to have. It's a stronger Cannibalize that undead have as well.<br />
<br />
Haymaker also seems really strong. A 3 sec stun and a &quot;substantial&quot; knockback? Granted it's got a 1 sec cast time, but that seems like a game winning racial. Especially if the knockback still goes off when someone's fully stun DRed.</div></div><hr />

Well you have to give the interns something to do. If you don't think there aren't those that need some help in the talent department then not sure what to say. They exist everywhere!!!!!</div></div><hr />

You read the Goblin Glider racial wrong. It's a 15 minute cooldown, not 2 minutes.</div></div><hr />
