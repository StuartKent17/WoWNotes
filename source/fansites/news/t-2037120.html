Unable to See Friends in Your Party In-Game<br />
We are currently investigating an issue where players in your party or raid may not be visible in-game due to being out of phase or on another realm. Our development team is currently working on a resolution and we'll be using this forum sticky to provide updates. <br />
<br />
<br />
Preview - Professions in Legion<br />
In World of Warcraft: Legion, a number of updates and improvements to Professions are on their way. Today, we’re taking a look at the new ways you’ll work with the resources of Azeroth—as well as some new raw materials left in the wake of the Burning Legion invasion.<br />
<br />
Quest to Be the Best<br />
First and foremost, you’re going to find yourself going on more Profession-related quests than ever before. An Archaeology questgiver may want you to work with Brann Bronzebeard. A Jewelcrafting questgiver may challenge you to put the finishing touches on some gems. Only a commitment to working with your Profession trainers will earn you the most cutting-edge recipes. There are new quests related to most everything you do in each Profession, and as you learn your new and improved tradeskills, Profession-oriented quests will push you to rank up your recipes.<br />
<br />
Recipes With Ranks<br />
That’s right, in Legion, you’ll commit to your recipes to upgrade them, making them more efficient than they previously were. You can see each recipe’s rank in stars in the updated Professions window.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/thumb/legProf01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/legProf01.jpg) <br />
<br />
Ranks also apply to your gathering Professions—mining, herbalism, and skinning—where you’ll earn ranks of perks that make you a better gatherer.<br />
<br />
Obliterum and Blood of Sargeras<br />
You’ll find that among the many new items related to Professions in Legion, two will surely stand out: Obliterum and Blood of Sargeras. You’ll obtain Blood of Sargeras in a number of ways—it can be an added drop when gathering or disenchanting, and can be received in all manner of quest and dungeon rewards.<br />
<br />
Blood of Sargeras is a rare reagent used in many recipes, from Engineering’s Cranial Cannons (a gun you wear on your head) to Jewelcrafting’s Chatterstone toy. Along with other reagents, Leatherworkers will use 25 Blood of Sargeras to craft the Great Northern Elderhorn mount.<br />
<br />
You’ll obtain Obliterum by obliterating crafted gear at your Obliterum Forge in Dalaran.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/thumb/legProf02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/july/legProf02.jpg) <br />
<br />
Obliterum is the epic item that upgrades the item level of your crafted armor by 5, taking it from item level 815 all the way to item level 850. As with so many steps in your professional development, gaining access to your Obliterum Forge is the subject of a quest line.<br />
<br />
This Thing Goes to 800<br />
Every Profession in Legion has 100 new levels of fascinating and fel discoveries for you to make, as well as new and exciting adventures for you to undertake. Archaeology in the Broken Isles means new finds that can turn up a mount, a pet, a toy, and some items that are available via quests rather than digsites. Tailors can make clothes chests that allow others in their party or raid to try on a whole set of clothes in one click. First Aid quests will have you bandaging up the wounded on the front lines of the war against the invading Legion. Scribes will create valuable Vantus Runes, which increase your performance against a specific boss, and you’ll want to savor Cooking, which now includes bacon. <br />
<br />
Some Blacksmiths will even learn how to craft a Steelbound Devourer mount!<br />
<br />

Group Loot Bugs<br />
We used Group Loot again in our raid last night and it is really getting frustrating. We are consistently having people that arent able to roll need on something that they want because of the iLvl restrictions, everyone in the raid was able to roll need on the Conq Tier Tokens even if they werent Paladin, Priest, Warlock .... <br />
There's a significant bug with Group Loot that posts like this have brought to light over the past day. On Leather and Mail armor, which has both Intellect and Agility, the presence of Intellect is incorrectly preventing Rogues and Hunters from rolling Need on those items. That's obviously unintended, and terrible. It shouldn't behave that way, and we're working towards a fix within the next day.<br />
<br />
The Tier Token behavior you mention is also unintended - class restrictions should be respected. We'll investigate and fix if something is awry there.<br />
<br />
No comment on the issue of iLvL restrictions preventing rolls? Or is that a working as intended with the intention being to really force PL on all situations and hope that altruism suddenly grows in the cesspit that is most of the playerbase?<br />
Sorry, I should have mentioned that. We don't believe that is currently happening, and it's absolutely not intended. If an item is for your class, you should be able to roll Need on it regardless. If it is specifically for your spec, your roll should take priority over off-spec rolls. And if an item is not for your class (unequippable or intended for a role your class cannot perform, such as a rogue looking at a tank trinket ), then you should only be able to roll Greed/DE. There should be no other logic or restrictions on the system, and if you encounter any, we'd be very interested in hearing more.<br />
<br />
The reports we've seen that seemed to blame player item level for inability to roll, thus far, were actually caused by the Rogue/Hunter issue I mentioned above.<br />

Forging a Hero - Arthas Statue<br />
Blizzard made a nice Arthas Statue for the 25th anniversary of the founding of Blizzard Entertainment!<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
This year marks the 25th anniversary of the founding of Blizzard Entertainment; and what better way to celebrate this epic milestone, than by casting one of the company’s most iconic characters in a 14 foot, 4,000 pound, truly one-of-a-kind statue. Located on the Calligraphy Greenway in Taichung, Taiwan, this bronze portrayal of the Lich King Arthas Menethil wasn’t created just to commemorate an anniversary, but also to recognize and celebrate the incredible Taiwanese gaming community.<br />
<br />
We’ve prepared a video below to give you a glimpse at how an army of talented individuals came together to bring one of Blizzard Entertainment’s most tragic characters out of the game and into the world. We hope you can feel the effort and passion that went into making this concept a reality. <br />
<br />
A Word from Mike Morhaime:<br />
“We are thrilled to see the unveiling of Arthas, created by Taiwanese designer, Steve Wang, happening in Taichung”, said Mike Morhaime, CEO and cofounder of Blizzard Entertainment. “The statue of Arthas is not just for the 25th birthday of Blizzard, but it is also our appreciation to all gaming communities in Taiwan. We are looking forward to the next 25 years of epic gaming experiences.”<br />

&lt;img src=&quot;http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/july/curseLogo.png&quot; style=&quot;margin-bottom:1px; margin-right:0px; vertical-align:bottom&quot; /&gt; Upcoming Curse Client Changes<br />
Curse Client v5 is being phased out, and all of its functionality is being added to the Curse app (https://www.curse.com/).<br />
<br />
Features<br />
<br />
Full Mac support<br />
Expanded localization support for many more languages<br />
No more ads<br />
Memory usage remains very low, even with full access to the feature-rich Curse app<br />
<br />
<br />
Process<br />
<br />
Stage one is rolling out WoW addons to the alpha Curse app. All alpha users will be able to check out the new World of Warcraft tab on the left navigation bar and immediately be able to access addon management.<br />
The second stage will push WoW addons to the live Curse app. The Curse app will also become the default download for new WoW addon users during this stage.<br />
The third stage will begin the migration of WoW Curse Client v5 users to the Curse app -- the client will provide information about the migration and point users to the Curse app. We are offering one free month of Curse Premium to all Curse Client v5 users who choose to migrate over to the Curse app during this stage as a thank you for trying it out early.<br />
The fourth and final stage will migrate all remaining Curse Client v5 users to the Curse app. The client will ask users to install the Curse app to continue managing their WoW addons.<br />
<br />

<br />
That'll be nice...once it gets here, I guess. <br />
<br />
Unless I completely missed it (a total possibility, I admit), I see no link to even the alpha client.<br />
<br />
/shrug. <br />
<br />
For YEARS, I would have paid for Curse Premium...but it didn't work on the Mac. Then they abandoned the Mac client, altogether. <br />
<br />
I hope it does actually deliver.</div></div><hr />

I downloaded it (on Win 10), installed - i cannot manage my wow addons. It's basically a feature rich Messenger client...<br />
<br />
As stated here: <br />
<br />
<br />
Stage one is rolling out WoW addons to the alpha Curse app. All alpha users will be able to check out the new World of Warcraft tab on the left navigation bar and immediately be able to access addon management.<br />
<br />
<br />
I cannot find any 'Alpha' version, so i downloaded the Client from curse.com, which gives you the new Curse client already, without wow addon management.<br />
Also, on the main Curse page curse.com there's no mentioning of wow addon management anymore. <br />
<br />
To say the least: pretty confusing!</div></div><hr />

Exactly this. I already have a dozen of Discord servers and my guild uses TS3. I don't need another goddamn chat client bloating my system when all I need is simple AddOn updating.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But i'm curious to see the reasoning behind introducing a new client without wow addon management already in it, while that was exactly the number 1 reason everyone is using the Curse client in the first place!</div></div><hr />

I'll keep using v5 until they add addon support to new client, then I'll switch to a new one, but I'll use it this way: open -&gt; update -&gt; kill.</div></div><hr />

That doesn't solve the issue that i still get a whole lot of completely pointless functions running while i use it. If nothing else, it will slow down the startup of the app for no good reason.<br />
<br />
The Curse Client already does more than i really need. If i had to start up this stupid app, i might as well just download everything directly again. And if Curse makes that harder, i'm just going elsewhere.</div></div><hr />

<br />
TBH, it loads as fast as v5 does, and v5 is slow, kek.<br />
<br />
Lack of modularity is a bit frustrating, but as a developer I sorta can guess why there's none. Well, they allow to &quot;disable&quot; things, and from what I've read, you'll be able to set addon manager as your default screen, at least something :p</div></div><hr />

So, I'm guessing it will be that for me as well:<br />

I have a concern about the ranks system, in that how is a player supposed to have any demand for them when they produce the same result for more materials.<br />
I would have preferred an improved crafting for higher ranks with an increase in material requirements.<br />
Make it so that there continues to be a demand for lower crafting ranks.<br />
It certainly helps to neaten it up though, rather than multiple for each.</div></div><hr />

I would have preferred an improved crafting for higher ranks with an increase in material requirements.<br />
Make it so that there continues to be a demand for lower crafting ranks.<br />
It certainly helps to neaten it up though, rather than multiple for each.<br />
<br />
You don't think being able to make, for example, two items at rank 3 for the same or less cost than one at rank 1 is a good thing?</div></div><hr />

He meant how do people with lower rank have demand for their items, as they produce the same items for more materials.<br />
<br />
And yeah, there won't be any. If you don't get max rank asap (as soon as the nolife grinder can get his hands on it), you will work at a loss.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That confused me too, but I think ComputerNerd was saying people wouldn't bother getting the higher ranks because it's easier to stick with the lower ranks and just spend more mats to make the same item.<br />

The Curse Client already does more than i really need. If i had to start up this stupid app, i might as well just download everything directly again. And if Curse makes that harder, i'm just going elsewhere.<br />
<br />
This. So very much this. Curse for years has been the easiest way for me to get addons. I can't even find addons on the stupid site now because it looks like a giant mess. If it weren't for the client I would have already abandoned curse all together. Soon as this app is forced on me I'm done. I'm gone. I'll go to wowinterface and just direct download from there.<br />
<br />
I don't even know how people handle updates without the client. Do you check daily? Keep a list of your addons with the current versions and make sure you have the most recent?</div></div><hr />

There are ways to script it, but curse is making that difficult, if not impossible, with web redirects and such. <br />
<br />
Another addon archive is needed. As I said in my other post, even github would be a significant improvement. Maybe it's time to start writing to the addon devs. Though I am not sure whether curse does some sort of revenue sharing with them. I have heard that curse gets bitchy with addons that are also on wowinterface.com</div></div><hr />

Many devs have their addons on GH\GL\BB, but what is it gonna change? Do you want users to learn git, install any kind git gui or what? O_o<br />
<br />
As for addons on wowinterface and curse, everyone is chill, moreover we can auto-pull stuff from curse to wowi, well, if we really want to do so...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Since spirit and bonus armor are removed, how you can recognize if an item is for a specific spec, beside trinkets? Am I missing something? For example if a plate armor drops, or a neck/ring, and you are a Holy Paladin, what will make that item specific to your spec?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Higher ranks produce the same for less materials.<br />
A lower rank produces the same for more, as in you are less &quot;efficient&quot; or less skilled so have lower yields.<br />
<br />
So I am thinking that after the initial rush once there is a sufficient number with higher ranks, that there is no reason for anyone to go to another player with anything but the highest rank.<br />
Because doing so will simply cost you more.<br />
<br />
That is why I liked the method of having the same enchant proc effect, but at varying levels in terms of material requirements going up in line with the effect.<br />
You want better, you spend more.<br />
You cant afford better, go less and get less.<br />
<br />
It is just the opposite, you go less and get more.<br />

You are looking t it from the enduser, not the crafter's point of view... the enduser always gets the same enchant.<br />
<br />
It's the crafter... when he first learns the recipe they can make it, but do to their ineptness it takes more materials. But at least they can craft it and make some gold as they go along. Over time they become more proficient and can make things with less mats... they make more gold per enchant.<br />

There is no less and more... there is just become more proficient, make more gold.</div></div><hr />

It's fucking garbage is what it is. If there's a way to run off the soon-to-be legacy version 5 then that's what I'll be doing. I don't need 95% of the fluff they've packed within the new app, I just need an addon manager.<br />
<br />
The amount of negative feedback and damage control on their page makes me wonder how long it'll take before they realize their new App is going in the wrong direction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You should get more proficient through repetition.<br />
But there is no demand for the lower ranks, because it is the same result for more materials.<br />
Therefore there is no reason for any buyer to go to someone with anything but the highest rank.<br />
That is why it is a problem - the lower ranks are useless.<br />
Previously we had better enchants or better crafting for more materials.<br />
<br />
That is how ranks should work to not make the others useless, and to not penalise the crafters.<br />
How can someone improve something when there is NO demand for it.</div></div><hr />
