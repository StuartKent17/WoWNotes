New Character Models<br />
<br />
The old Dwarf male has 1,160 polygons and was mirrored on both sides. The new model is 7,821 polygons and has higher texture resolutions. The face doesn't have to be symmetrical anymore.<br />
They went 956 to 5,408 polygons on the Gnomes. 130 to 196 bones. Texture resolution was 2 to 5x higher depending on the area of the body.<br />
Dwarf Female, Tauren Male, and Female Troll models are all being worked on right now.<br />
All of the original races, Draenei, and Blood Elves will be getting new models for Warlords. <br />
Worgen and Goblin won't be getting new models right away. The team will take a look at those models after all of the other ones are done.<br />
Facial hair is animated using bones.<br />
Capes are now animated using bones to flow more naturally.<br />
Gnome female pigtails are now animated.<br />

<br />
<br />
Q&amp;A Recap<br />
These are some of the more important points from the Q&amp;As today.<br />
<br />
Warlords Release Date<br />
<br />
Another MoP patch would delay WoD, so Patch 5.5 isn't going to happen. The entire team is working on WoD right now, so any more MoP content would slow down development.<br />
Q: &quot;Typically after you announce something it is another year, but we are at Patch 5.4 now. What content do you have planned for between now and then?&quot; A: &quot;Any content we do now will delay the expansion by the same amount of time it took us to make that content. We are completely focused on making the next expansion and will try to deliver that as soon as we can, hopefully on a shorter cycle than players are imagining, but you never know, we will have to see.&quot; <br />
Q: &quot;Typically that would be in the Winter of next year. Does that mean it is a goal to bring it in to Summer or Spring?&quot; A: &quot;Well certainly the goal is before that, but we'll see, it is very hard for us to predict.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons and Raids<br />
<br />
The new Flex loot model will work similar to how Master Loot does today, but the number of drops will scale based on the number of people eligible for loot in the group. The personal loot system won't be removed, you will just have to opt in to it.<br />
The number of drops will scale well with the number of players, as each additional player gives you a higher chance to get another drop, up to where it is guaranteed. This ensures that are no odd breakpoints that will restrict raid sizes.<br />
Mythic raid lockout is boss based, static id, nothing is changing from the current Heroic lockout system.<br />
The game has a Raid Browser that no one uses, so in WoD it will be expanded to support killing world bosses, doing achievements, finishing Shadowmourne, or any other activity. This will support cross realm groups and encourage people to do PuGs rather than completely random matchmaking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests and Leveling<br />
<br />
You can technically buy as many level 90s as you want if you buy another copy of the game, get the level 90, and then transfer the character to your main account each time. The team has talked about putting a level 90 purchase option in the store, but it hasn't been decided yet.<br />
There will be a legendary questline again in WoD. The questline will be a little bit more custom to your class to help with the lack of class quests. Class quests are very resource intensive, so at most we might see one or two in WoD. (Maybe Shaman)<br />
Leveling in WoD will be a fun and fast paced romp through the zones. The team is backing off the idea that leveling should be a long grind.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Character Models<br />
<br />
The team hasn't decided how new character models will be released yet. It could have all of the completed race at launch, or they could be added every patch. <br />
There will be no free re-customization for characters after new character models.<br />
<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
<br />
There aren't any plans for another WoW Annual Pass. It was a good idea at the time because getting Diablo 3 free made it a good deal, but it isn't a good for the the D3 expansion. <br />
Recruit a Friend will be back next week.<br />
The tertiary stats may be limited to a certain slot, like speed only on boots. It will be rare enough that by the time you can farm them progression races will be over. They shouldn't have a big impact on progression races.<br />
Racial balance will be tuned again in WoD, trying to narrow the gap. Goblin and Worgen have better balanced racials than many other races right now.<br />
<br />
<br />
Warcraft Movie<br />
<br />
Duncan Jones has played the Warcraft games, World of Warcraft, and even Lost Vikings. He originally played Ultima Online.<br />
Jones liked the script, but it was very Alliance centric. He thought it would be better to make it about both sides and the original Warcraft.<br />
There is concept art for Draenor, Dalaran, Ironforge, Stormwind<br />
The story is Orcs vs Humans. Lothar and Durotan.<br />
The style of this war movie will be similar to Gladiator, gritty.<br />
The first movie has to be done right, then they can think about doing more.<br />
The majority of the movie takes place in the Eastern Kingdoms.<br />
The lore of this time doesn't have many female characters, but the producers are pushing for including some female characters.<br />
We will see a preview sometime next year, maybe at Blizzcon.<br />
The Lord of the Rings movies inspired Jones to want to do this movie. He wants to match or beat them at making an awesome movie.<br />
The movie will be PG13, but the PG13 rating is shifting. You can get away with a lot more now and still be PG13.<br />
<br />

<br />
The Blackrock Foundry will be the second raid available at release. It is the center of the Iron Horde and has 10 bosses in three wings, with a non linear layout<br />
Flex becomes Normal, Normal becomes Heroic, and Heroic becomes 20 player fixed size Mythic. All levels of difficulty except for Mythic will be cross realm on release.<br />
Each raid difficulty has its own lockout. They will be loot based lockouts, allowing you to kill the same boss multiple times per week and only get loot once a week.<br />
There will be more optional content and less quest hubs that have to be unlocked by another chain first, along with more dynamic events and treasures found in the world. <br />
There will be few or no daily quests at level 100! It will be a mix of the story in 5.1 and Timeless Isle in 5.4.<br />
Hit, Expertise, Dodge, Parry, Reforging, all gone!<br />
The primary stats on armor will now change based on your spec. Plate drops and it will have whatever stats your class needs, no more Intellect plate! No more PvP Priest Healing set and PvP Priest DPS set, just a Priest set.<br />
Tertiary stats are bonus stats that can appear on gear that don't count towards the item level budget. Lifesteal, avoidance, sturdiness, movement speed, cleave, and more.<br />

Warlords of Draenor will bring us Garrisons, new character models, Level 100, World PvP zone, and a free level 90 character. <br />
<br />
World of Warcraft: What's Next (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3523-World-of-Warcraft-What-s-Next)<br />
<br />
Garrosh escapes and goes to Draenor to build the Iron Horde, which will try to invade Azeroth. <br />
Draenor is somewhat similar to Outland, but all built from scratch. The Ogre empire there is in decline. <br />
Garrisons are your personal base, buildings have multiple tiers, specializations, offline progression, and more!<br />
Seven dungeons, Two Raids with 16 bosses, World Bosses, Normal, Heroic, Mythic raid difficulties. <br />
World PvP zone uses cross realm zone tech to create a faction balanced zone that always has PvP going on.<br />
Trial of the Gladiator (Arenas) will take place at more defined times during the week and give you the gear so that everyone is on equal footing as far as gear goes.<br />

Garrosh is creating the Iron Horde, but he only sets things in motion, he isn't the main bad guy.<br />
This isn't a time travel expansion, time travel is just a tool to explain the ongoing story. It isn't being used to massively change the current timeline. The past is fine!<br />

They've stated that Blood Elves and Draenei are not getting updated.<br />

I do wonder if there will be a huge outcry after the new models are done, seeing as female Belves and Draenei are super common and won't stack up to any of the other models in the game.</div></div><hr />

You can technically buy as many level 90s as you want if you buy another copy of the game, get the level 90, and then transfer the character to your main account each time. The team has talked about putting a level 90 purchase option in the store, but it hasn't been decided yet.<br />
<br />
That part scares me a bit, but we'll see I guess.<br />

90 levels is quite a lot of levelling to do if you want to roll a new character for the expansion. Especially if you've already got multiple 90s already and therefore have seen all the content multiple times. *shrugs*</div></div><hr />

That is one of the best things i've heard, along with the stat squish. I haven't played since early cataclysm and knowing that i would be able to just skip the whole panda parade goes on the plus side of reasons to maybe return in my book.</div></div><hr />

Wrong!! If you actually read the new models section at the top of page you will see that Belfs and Draenei will be getting new models..<br />
<br />
New Character Models<br />
<br />
The old Dwarf male has 1,160 polygons and was mirrored on both sides. The new model is 7,821 polygons and has higher texture resolutions. The face doesn't have to be symmetrical anymore.<br />
They went 956 to 5,408 polygons on the Gnomes. 130 to 196 bones. Texture resolution was 2 to 5x higher depending on the area of the body.<br />
Dwarf Female, Tauren Male, and Female Troll models are all being worked on right now.<br />
All of the original races, Draenei, and Blood Elves will be getting new models for Warlords.<br />
Worgen and Goblin won't be getting new models right away. The team will take a look at those models after all of the other ones are done.<br />
Facial hair is animated using bones.<br />
Capes are now animated using bones to flow more naturally.<br />
Gnome female pigtails are now animated.</div></div><hr />

Yeah you would think that they would allow at least one re customization per character on your account, after that then start slogging for any extra customizations.. Let's hope Blizz see the errors of their ways but will see..</div></div><hr />

Blizzards argument is the new models don't change the overall look and feel of the characters. So they'd suggest the new models will simply make you more happy with what you originally picked rather than wanting to change. But I guess there is the store element they consider too. But I don't see everyone rushing to change their look.</div></div><hr />

But there will still be revamps to every single face... How do we know that the face we chose will still be the face preferred after the update? Even if it matches our previous choice there could be new ones that we like even more. Plus, while hairstyles can easily be bought in-game, it'd be nice to get a chance to get a free hair change, face change, etc...<br />
<br />
At least we will be getting a free 90 I guess, with all the freedom of race, class, etc. we want.<br />
<br />
Also, I wonder if these new customization options will include eye color.. Would be a simple yet amazing change. Or how muscular the character is as well. Also excited about the scars they mentioned... Both male and female better get some though.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gruffertus</div><div class="date">2013-11-10, 09:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The new Flex loot model will work similar to how Master Loot does today, but the number of drops will scale based on the number of people eligible for loot in the group. The personal loot system won't be removed, you will just have to opt in to it.<br />
<br />
Mythic raid lockout is boss based, static id, nothing is changing from the current Heroic lockout system.<br />
<br />
Each raid difficulty has its own lockout. They will be loot based lockouts, allowing you to kill the same boss multiple times per week and only get loot once a week.<br />
<br />
I'm not actually getting a clear picture from this:<br />
<br />
Will LFR/Normal/Heroic mean that you can kill the same boss over and over, but the master looter will have to be aware of who is and isn't eligible for loot?<br />
<br />
The 'current Heroic lockout system' doesn't let you kill the same boss over and over.<br />
<br />
Or do they mean 'the same boss once on each difficulty'? So if you kill up to the 5th boss on Heroic, you then have to kill up to that boss again, with no loot, on Normal, and progress from there?</div></div><hr />

Indeed. This really comes across as a money-grubbing corporate move. They force new skins on everyone but people have to pay when they don't like the changes. Not a good thing when all they have to do is flip a switch and make a one time re-customization available for all.<br />
<br />
I do hope they reconsider. It won't be a short-term membership loss but people will remember each and every time a company screws them out of their money in such a harsh way. In the long term, this will have a negative effect.</div></div><hr />

The only thing I remember from before Blizzcon was Blizzard stating they'd start with the vanilla races first, since Draenei and Blood Elves already had a higher poly-count and therefore less of a priority.<br />

GOing to be worth it though, just check the female Gnome's facial expressions (or the male one on video, whilst performing his dance). Can't wait to see what humans are going to look like :)</div></div><hr />

They actually said the exact opposite of that.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yea, they will update every model pre cata, but belfs and draenei will be last.</div></div><hr />

They've stated that Blood Elves and Draenei are not getting updated.<br />
<br />
I do wonder if there will be a huge outcry after the new models are done, seeing as female Belves and Draenei are super common and won't stack up to any of the other models in the game.<br />
<br />
Where have they stated this I wonder? I ask this because the lead artist in charge of new models stated that they are working on all of the models pre-MoP during the World of Warcraft: The Adventure Continues panel.</div></div><hr />

Problem with that logic is they're gonna get updated whether you buy the xpac or not. People who hadn't bought Cata still saw the reforged world.

Woooooooooow I'm really shocked at this, this is a huge cash grab on Blizzard's part. Of course everyone is going to want to recustomize their characters after the model update, unless each model is ending up with only one face or skin tone.</div></div><hr />

I know in the past expansions the wait time was incredibly long but the WoW team is huge now, theres no reason WoD can't be out by April to May. Wouldn't be surprised to see beta in December with pre patch sometime in March. Maybe it will have a bit of world content before WoD launch.<br />
<br />
<br />
I posted my comment before that was added. I'm sure if I looked I'd be able to find a post from months ago stating that they didn't intend to do Draenei and Belves, but I'm glad they've added them to the list, even Worgen &amp; Goblins apparently.<br />

It's more than just that. It's pretty clear that Blizz is going to shove WoD out the door as soon as they can, and and apparently they work on a shoe-string schedule like a web cartoonist, where they're barely keeping up, with no real planning or scheduling.

Au contraire, just like all of us, they can quit. Although what practical effect that will have, I don't know any more, because apparently Blizzard is motivated neither by money nor by devotion to the integrity of their game.</div></div><hr />

And that's exactly that, they said they plan to NOT HAVE THAT kind of situation again. Did you even read what they said? They are pouring more effort into getting the expac out. And what would 5.5 be? Ruby Sanctum all over again?

This is PR talk and not anything that ppl should trust. Blizzard knows they are letting alot of players down with lack of new dungeons in WOD. So they do the exact same thing they did when ppl realised that 8 months had passed between dragon soul and MOP.... Then they said plans to not let that happen again. NOW... on the other hand.... we realise we are in for the exact same thing cause it is now CONFIRMED that there is no patch 5.5 and the ENTIRE teams is AGAIN working only on the expansion... leaving the live ... paid for servers... totally without updateds for.... 8 months? 10 months? ...

Last night, I saw one of the highlights say they're going to still have a 'pre-event', they're just not going to have a 'ruby-sanctum' style patch that adds a tiny raid that only offers a few hours of distraction at most :P. Taking raid team that would work on that and focus on knocking out the expansion quicker, sounds like a win win to me....<br />

New Character Models<br />
<br />
The old Dwarf male has 1,160 polygons and was mirrored on both sides. The new model is 7,821 polygons and has higher texture resolutions. The face doesn't have to be symmetrical anymore.<br />
They went 956 to 5,408 polygons on the Gnomes. 130 to 196 bones. Texture resolution was 2 to 5x higher depending on the area of the body.<br />
Dwarf Female, Tauren Male, and Female Troll models are all being worked on right now.<br />
All of the original races, Draenei, and Blood Elves will be getting new models for Warlords.<br />
Worgen and Goblin won't be getting new models right away. The team will take a look at those models after all of the other ones are done.<br />
Facial hair is animated using bones.<br />
Capes are now animated using bones to flow more naturally.<br />
Gnome female pigtails are now animated.<br />
<br />
Lets stick to facts shall we and skip the fan talk.<br />
<br />
Draenei and Blood elves will NOT get new models at launch of WOD. That was said loud and clear by devs. ONLY the old orginal vanilla races are being worked on right now and note this... There is NOTHING saying that the expansion will launch with ANY new models... cause Blizzard has stated already multiple times that they are not ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;The team hasn't decided how new character models will be released yet. It could have all of the completed race at launch, or they could be added every patch.&quot;<br />

No. He said that all races would get updated models &quot;for&quot; WOD (acting like it would be at launch)<br />
<br />
Fact is that there might be updates for the two TBC races at some point during the next expansion (in some of the patches) witch spans about 2 years.<br />

He didn't say or hint at launch, and they didn't say launch. &quot;WoD&quot; can easily be meant to encompass the whole expansion, patches and all.

<br />
The PR is not matching anything atm. They have just announched the most underwelming Expansion for World of Warcraft with zero new race, zero new class, minimal class changes (maybe one extra ability at most), reworked outland (even tho they claim its done from scratch) and least amount of Dungeons of ANY expansion.<br />
<br />
And here is another fact. TBC launched with more dungeons and stronger raid tiers including more bosses than this so called &quot;biggest dev team of WOW to date&quot; is doing. That is how weak this expansion is. It is not even matching the original Outland expansion in terms of core features of the game.<br />

He didn't say or hint at launch, and they didn't say launch. &quot;WoD&quot; can easily be meant to encompass the whole expansion, patches and all. Plus you also said &quot;Worgen and Goblin will not get updated&quot; even though that's exactly what they said, they'll just be low priority<br />
<br />
He is talking the same PR as BLizzard atm... hinting at things that we all know are not going to happen. So lets stick to the real quotes.. not some that are made up to sound as promising as possible.<br />
<br />
Do you know how many Dungeons TBC had at launch for players to enjoy while leveling ? <br />
<br />
16<br />
<br />
Do you know how many we will get during 90- 100 levels now? <br />

For the last fucking time, they are not 'reworked zones'. Even from the little we have, we know that won't be true...take one look at Shadowmoon Valley and tell me that's the 'same zone' from TBC. Hellfire is going to be a polar opposite, if they somehow manage to 'rework' that, they deserve even more credit.... Frostfire Ridge didn't even exist(literally, the landmass is gone in 'Outland'). Gorgrond and Nagrand(2/7) are the only zones that are looking to be anything like their counterparts. I've already linked to screenshots, the faction zone vids and more enough... Go to the WoD page and see for yourself.<br />
<br />
As far as class changes, did you miss the 'level bonuses' they showed? 10 new passives, perks, and changes far outweighs the '1 new ability, 1-2 passives' that every class had, especially since every class already has some 'dead moves' that I'd rather see have new life than make new moves(example, Mind Spike for S-Priests). MoP leveling got really old, really quick(85-90 in most specs didn't add anything 'special', for example, my warlock, I got the new teleport spell, which doesn't really see much use til you hit max level, and Pandemic at max level, so mostly what I was seeing when I dinged was 'congratulations, you get a new dungeon').<br />

Um, you're numbers are off... at launch in TBC, We had the 2 hellfire dungeons as leveling(Shattered Halls was 'max level'), Underbog and Slave Pens(Steamvaults was tuned for max levels, despite letting you in early), 3 of the 4 auchenai dungeons(Shadow Labs again, not tuned for pre-70's), and the CoT dungeons. The Whole of TK's 5 mans were only accessible with flying, unless you had a warlock summon you...not exactly 'open for business'. So, that leaves us with 9, almost half the number you stated. Still more than WoD, I'll give you that(hell, I'd say TBC had 7 cause I'd almost debate with you that Sethekk Halls/Black morass were intended to be max level, but I bet you'd deny it :P)... but definitely not '4x as much'.<br />
<br />
Edit:Anyways, I'm done here. My point is, all we have is PR, yes, but that's all we've EVER HAD till Beta of a particular expansion, yes, even TBC. Maybe if come Beta they've failed to hit some of those promises(and I'm certain a few of them will fall through, as always), I'll start agreeing on some points, but right now, there's no reason to, except sheer 'denial' of every point they make.</div></div><hr />

Pitchforks are already being lit. Lots of threads here, on the official forums on both US and EU, on various other fan sites I go to. Once beta starts there will be more, once casual people log in after PAYING for an expansion and PAYING their subscription and seeing they're ALLOWED to pay for a customization cause they don't like the new face and skin blizz decided for them they're going to freak. When they learn other mmo's updated their models and gave free re-customizations to their customers people are going to freak.<br />
<br />
I remember I wanted to try Rift a few months ago. Was talking to my buddy about how I made a character and I'm already level 20. He says he has one that's level 40 and will come over to my server. I ask him how much that costs and he says, &quot;costs?&quot; and he's on my server. FOR FREE. Other games don't nickle and dime and gouge their customers as much as this greedy company does, considering how much more a month they make it's sickening.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes I saw the class &quot;perks&quot; that Im 100% certain of will not make it through. Adding permanent perks on certain abilities will not make it through any more than did &quot;path of the titans&quot;.<br />
<br />
And in terms of MOP.. that was 5 levels... and yes ... its true... MOP leveling was underwhelming... and that was only 5 lvls.<br />
<br />
http://wowpedia.org/The_Burning_Crusade_instances_by_level Current list of TBC instances.<br />
<br />
I ran most of those instances like 50 times each. I know how many they were. Some were added later... something that was NOT done during MOP and ppl should NOT count on as &quot;we like to&quot; PR talk at this point. Facts are all we have now... <br />
<br />
And the fact when it comes to core feature of the game as in 5 man dungeons.. is that everything is telling us that the encounter team in terms of dungeons and raids is SMALLER now... than it was ... even 6 years ago. And 4 dungeons while leveling from 90-100 tells us that BLizzard is not making that team any bigger for WOD. They are just doing the same as they did in MOP... cut the numbers of bosses for 5 mans and turn them into raid bosses.</div></div><hr />

No grouping tools for normal/heroic outside of 3rd party mods/websites. NOTHING to help small guilds keep going or get off the ground. STILL having the mystic (heroic 2.0) realm limited!(why god why). They went with stat squish... Say goodbye to year to year growth and hello to wrath numbers. Love the game but they offered nothing for the fresh new player and the struggling small guild and/or realm people while kicking current 10man heroic (mythic) players square in the nuts.<br />
And pvp? Why they do this. Still no solo q option for rbgs and arena (gotta use a 3rd party mod or jump through hoops to get keep a team going). Tons of new world pvp crap, that no one will do much of unless it has rbg/arena level rewards. Cause its boring as hell when you outnumber the enemy, nearly impossible to have fun when the enemy outnumbers you, laggy/unstable with large numbers and NEVER balanced in numbers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is basically just a patch that we have to pay for. No new races, no new classes, the only thing expansion like is we get to grind out 10 levels. But then they only gave us 3 new dungeons for those 10 levels. If it doesn't come out very soon, within 5 months then they'll be kissing a lot of subscriptions good bye. Nobody is going to wait 9+ months for this little content.</div></div><hr />

Why? We don't need any. It's so bloated now and most classes have something another class has anyway.<br />

A 5th raid difficulty....because 4 wasn't enough. Derp. Also the whole following Garrosh to Outland, even if it is a new map, it's still dumb. Was really expecting the return of Sargeras and the Burning Legion, not more Garrosh. Bleh. Garrosh is done, he lost.

Blizzard made very deep, extremely complex games that were accessible because of unbelievably good UIs and continuously and incrementally rewarding gameplay. It did NOT MATTER that some raid content was inaccessible to many people because there was so much to do and rewarding gameplay for every type of player. Now they have discarded that for only having end game content, and a blitz through a mindlessly streamline leveling process. They have clearly lost their way and will probably never get it back. <br />
<br />
Seems to me that this expansion is only a large content patch designed to be a movie tie in in a very flawed attempt to attract new users.</div></div><hr />

It feels cheap somehow. I'll give it the benefit of the doubt, and it should be fun. MoP so far was my least favorite expansion, but questing and story were well done, I just didn't care for the eastern theme. Just a personal preference. I enjoyed the Wrathion quest chain immensely. Timeless Isle was meh. Felt like filler content. Thunder isle was much better.<br />
<br />
The expansion should look nice graphically, but there's really no excuse on the player models not being ready 100% at launch. If they dangle the player model carrot for 5 patches to try to keep people hanging on, it will be sickening.<br />
<br />
I cancelled until they get the realm population issues fixed. I REFUSE to pay to have to transfer my characters when the only server I got to choose was in 2005. It's not my fault people left the faction I was playing on the servers I've been on. I've taken free transfers every chance I get, but it just gets worse. Cross realm zoning in a party was a good step in the right direction, but the game thrives on economy. I think the the profession changes are indicative that they know things may get sparse in the future, and they possibly don't want the economy to play such a huge role in gearing up. A lot of people on these fringe servers can't get the gems/enchants they need without maxing out 2 or 3 characters. I'm willing to be most will quit before paying to transfer, or putting in loads of time so they can have gems/enchants available.</div></div><hr />

WoW also isn't going to pull anything like the dreaded NGE for SWG, as experience is now their guide for further game development.<br />
<br />
An expansion like this isn't a cash grab in prep for a fallout. The &quot;jump the shark&quot; expansion would involve fighting Sargeras. If anything, it seems like WoW is going back into it's roots of innovating ideas from other games; and cutting them to fit their design philosophy. <br />
<br />
I lovingly called this &quot;The EQ2/Guild Wars Expansion&quot; to my wife... halfheartedly of course.<br />
<br />
They talked a lot about &quot;kits&quot; at the con, which shows they're admitting WoW's aging. I believe that their intention is to get ready to pump out more expansions faster after WoD; more than likely geared towards individual racial issues. It's not uncommon for a game studio to use culture kits to quickly make themed expansion content... it's just been uncommon in WoW till now.<br />
<br />
I really don't think they'd use such poor judgement as to wait a year to release WoD. Especially after dropping the bombshell that there will be no 5.5 release.<br />
<br />
Finally, the whole &quot;Jaded WoW Player&quot; mindset is a common cliche now in the MMO world. I feel a lot of the &quot;WoW is doomed to a slow death starting now&quot; talk comes from a lack of WoW players enjoying other MMO's as well.</div></div><hr />

&quot;We’re still in the process of determining which races will be available upon the expansion’s release, but our goal is to update all eight of the original World of Warcraft playable races, along with the Draenei and Blood Elves, over the course of the expansion launch and subsequent content updates.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Draenei and Blood elves will NOT get new models at launch of WOD. That was said loud and clear by devs. ONLY the old orginal vanilla races are being worked on right now and note this... There is NOTHING saying that the expansion will launch with ANY new models... cause Blizzard has stated already multiple times that they are not ready.<br />
<br />
&quot;The team hasn't decided how new character models will be released yet. It could have all of the completed race at launch, or they could be added every patch.&quot;<br />
<br />
NO WORK HAS YET BEEN DONE ON THE TWO TBC ADDED RACES. That is a fact and was claimed at Blizzcon 2013.<br />
<br />
Here is a DIRECT quote from MMO-Champion <br />
Worgen and Goblin won't be getting new models right away. The team will take a look at those models after all of the other ones are done.<br />
<br />
http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3529-Art-of-World-of-Warcraft line 17.<br />
<br />
Next time read my post you quoted did I say that the updated Belf and Draenei models were going to be at launch no I did not.<br />
<br />
And again I will bold / underline and italic the part again from the front page.. That all the races up to and including the ones added in TBC will have new models..<br />
<br />
New Character Models<br />
<br />
The old Dwarf male has 1,160 polygons and was mirrored on both sides. The new model is 7,821 polygons and has higher texture resolutions. The face doesn't have to be symmetrical anymore.<br />
They went 956 to 5,408 polygons on the Gnomes. 130 to 196 bones. Texture resolution was 2 to 5x higher depending on the area of the body.<br />
Dwarf Female, Tauren Male, and Female Troll models are all being worked on right now.<br />
All of the original races, Draenei, and Blood Elves will be getting new models for Warlords.<br />
Worgen and Goblin won't be getting new models right away. The team will take a look at those models after all of the other ones are done.<br />
Facial hair is animated using bones.<br />
Capes are now animated using bones to flow more naturally.<br />
Gnome female pigtails are now animated.<br />
<br />
- - - Updated - - -<br />
<br />
<br />
While they claimed no work has been done, they never said they're not doing them...quite the opposite in fact... It was at the damn Q &amp; A that they said it... they've also said they might do some models at launch with others 'staggered' through patches(which honestly, is the better idea, as long as they start getting previews of the others up around that time).<br />
<br />
Every post you make makes me think you haven't even read the announcements...<br />
<br />
Edit: I see you edited your original post, which now makes this make even less sense. You're practically saying what the guy you were quoting said...:P<br />
<br />
Yeah makes no sense now though I did quote their original post on this and yes looks like they didn't read that section on the front page..</div></div><hr />

the problem is the amount of hate out there. Young blood typically lack the fortitude and willingness to get hate thrown at them (and have death threats on their families) and thus do not appear in the spot light.<br />

hell many altogether avoid game careers, severely damaging the industry.<br />

all thanks to &quot;fans&quot; who blow even the most basic of sentences out of proportion or find a scapegoat for perceived slights.<br />

<br />
Yeah in a sense it won't be games devs and publishers that kill off the games industry it will be games communities and fans that will do it through their sometimes rabid over zealousness and hate..</div></div><hr />

Plate drops and it will have whatever stats your class needs, no more Intellect plate! No more PvP Priest Healing set and PvP Priest DPS set, just a Priest set.<br />
<br />
How is no one talking about this?<br />
<br />
Is this going to work like timeless isle or is one gear set all my druid is going to need to play any spec? (besides trinkets / weapons) <br />

Because if this is the case I will 100% be playing hybrids from now on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The team hasn't decided how new character models will be released yet. It could have all of the completed race at launch, or they could be added every patch.<br />
<br />
Not to sound like an arse, but if we are not getting a new race or class.. Shouldn't they for sure have it ready at launch?</div></div><hr />

<br />
BLizzard said in August they were done with 25% of the models for vanilla Races. That took them 2 years. They just started work on female dwarfs and Night elves now. Then they said that they would take a look at TBC races after that. The chance of those races being in at launch are zero IMO. <br />
<br />
Blizzard and some of the fanboys are out here trying to make it sound like all the original classes + tbc races will be ready at launch of WOD. Its very much understandable they are trying to build that as a hype since the expansion has so little to offer in terms of new races and classes. The fact of the matter is that it looks highly unlikely when you actually read what was said at Blizzcon. <br />
<br />
With that said. I do expect all old models to get updated within the next 2 years. Cause that is quite frankly the time frame BLizzard has given. But it would NOT surprise me one bit tho if they keep draenei and Blood elves until even later. It could become a selling point for the Expansion in 2 years time... just like the models are now the selling point for WOD... even tho the expansion might launch with ZERO new models.<br />

Yes - this will help hybrids alot. It's not on all gear tho. <br />
<br />
MOP did a horrible job of supporting multirole characters. It caused all sort of issues that BLizzard should have realised well before.. but didin't. These changes will help for sure. BUt for me.... Not enough to get me back into the game.</div></div><hr />

The gnome is also so cute. I know everyone's crying that there's no new race/class, but how can you not be thrilled to get these new models for the original characters we've been playing for &gt;8 years (in my case). That's 10x better than a new race where I try out the starting zone and check out the /dance then go back to my priest. I bet new models + the free 90 + the TBC connection will bring some people back into the fold. Very excited for this xpac.</div></div><hr />

W-P-D ... D-R-M ... M-P-W ... and we miss the third one with H-S-?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Jotunhammer</div><div class="date">2013-11-11, 07:08 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I am looking at this expansion and I keep wondering....<br />
<br />
First and formost I wonder, is this really an expansion?<br />
To me is it not an expansion, it is just prolonging the MoP, the expansion that in my mind killed off all interest for me for WoW.<br />
<br />
Really? New models for old toon, thats going to make or break the game?<br />
Really? Go back to BC stuff... im waiting for a reincarnation of Illidan who will say &quot;Now... you are not prepared&quot; <br />
Garrison, thats new...oh wait... what is it again? area in a town that can be unlocked, thats sounds familiar, anyone ever been playing BC and that cute little island...<br />
woot, level 100, what useless skill do we get tot eh 10 extra levels? something like &quot;shine the totem&quot; for shaman for example.<br />
<br />
No, really, I expected much much more from Blizzard, it seems to me that for every expansion there has been less and less truly imaginitive new things and <br />
it is more and more regugurating the old stuff. Heck I was hopeing for Emerald Dream expansion and some truly epic historical content. and what do we get?<br />
<br />
This is not blowing any new life into WoW and I for one thing that WoW time at the throne of MMO is over. They lack the &quot;new blood&quot; and the willpower to create<br />
anything thats awesome, thats swings, that make you sit up and pay attention.<br />
<br />
and it is sad. cause I am old school WoW and to see it this way is just....sad</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">crsh1976</div><div class="date">2013-11-11, 07:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I was hoping for something.. better. Then again, WoW is old and I shouldn't hope for it to last forever - it's just not going to happen.<br />
<br />
No new class, no new race, 10 &quot;speedy&quot; levels (so presumably less content to fill those 10 levels), a free lv90 of your choosing, and then.. garrisons, ok fine that may not appeal to me but surely it'll thrill someone.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Forgot the new character models. Well it'll be nice, as far as the original races are concerned at least, but I have the stinkin' feeling we're not actually getting as much as they would like to make it sound - it is no doubt an insane amount of work, but it's not a content feature you build an expansion around - so they surely have to find a balance between the two.<br />
<br />
And then the weirdest part is the timing; 5.4 has been out for 2 months and they confirmed there's no 5.5 - no new content until WoD comes out, but we don't know when it's coming out (and Blizz sure as hell doesn't want to say anything about it). <br />
<br />
Typically expansions are announced before we get stuck in the last tier of content that'll get stretched out to carry us over to the next expansion, but not this time. Is it bad planning or are we set for an actual surprise - say, WoD comes out before the end of the year? Hopefully they're not out to repeat the awful 6-month wait at the end of WotLK.</div></div><hr />

Sort of an updated graphics trickle-down for cities and faction NPCs. So it isn't just about you hiding your shiny new character model under your gear but also seeing them whenever you talk to quest givers/merchants/guards etc. Obviously major characters who already have unique models (Thrall, Garrosh, Varian, Jaina, Voljin, Sylvanas etc) probably will not be effected but they look better than the players already.</div></div><hr />

Some cool features but as Blizz mentioned during Blizzcon, they want expansion features compartmentalized to their expansions. With that in mind, WoD will be quickly forgotten then. If you ask me, WoD is more about lore. Especially since WoD will lead into the next expansion. At this point, why even call them expansions?</div></div><hr />

I still prefer the idea of some kind of xp buff that unlocks after you hit max level on a character, so you have that indepth levelling experience once, then don't have to drag yourself through it on every alt.</div></div><hr />

Nothing else aside from the inventory changes really excites me about this expansion though.</div></div><hr />

Like an over-fed twelve year old with lopsided bulgy eyes, too much make up and constantly pulling some face... like they are trying too hard to make her look 'cute'.<br />
Making characters that look like prepubescent girls in a game for players over twelve is kind of a strange thing to do.</div></div><hr />
