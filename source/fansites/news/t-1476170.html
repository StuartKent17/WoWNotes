Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews<br />
There were a few developer interviews at the recent press events, so today we are taking a look at interviews with Alex Afrasiabi from Ausgamers (http://www.ausgamers.com/features/read/3420634). Most of the information has already been covered in other interviews, but there are a few new things:<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor has roughly 10 new mounts.<br />
Warlords of Draenor has roughly 10 new scenarios.<br />
Garrisons could come to Azeroth in the future if the devs feel like it is the right decision based on what they learn from Warlords of Draenor.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Cross-Realm Normal Siege of Orgrimmar and Feat of Strength Achievements<br />
The idea of being able to do Cross-Realm Siege of Orgrimmar in normal difficulty came up again recently, but the chances don't appear much better than they did a few months ago. It appears that the Siege of Orgrimmar Feat of Strength achievements (http://www.wowdb.com/achievements/character/feats-of-strength?filter-patch=17056&amp;filter-search=garrosh) will also be removed with Patch 6.0.<br />

<br />
<br />
New Character Models - Face Variations<br />
There has been some concern (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/1471213-So-the-new-character-models-suffer-from-quot-Same-face-quot-as-the-Pandaren-do-too) about the variety of faces offered with the new models. It looks like we will get some answers in a future Artcraft post!<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/march/sameFace.png (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/442522835995475968) <br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor Flying<br />
It's only in the new areas. There is no difference than any other past expansions. You cannot fly at the beginning of expansions (cata being the one exception). I'm sure we will all live.<br />
This is pretty true. You couldn't get flying in Outland until you reached maximum level and bought the skill. Wrath of the Lich King you couldn't fly right away either. The same recently for Mists of Pandaria in which until you reached the maximum level to get the ability to do so. This is not new for an expansion to not allow flying immediately upon entering into a new expansion. <br />
<br />
That said, the developers are also aware of the concerns that people may have about how easy or difficult it will be to get around to the various locations. They have said before that they want to still provide convenient ways for people to still travel without minimizing the impact on exploration within the zones. As always, we welcome constructive feedback and discussion provided it's kept constructive. We'll also continue to keep an eye on things not only within beta (when that occurs) but also when we go live to see just how people truly end up playing and interacting.<br />
<br />
I just wanted to take a moment to reiterate that constructive feedback is great –we love it– and also to reemphasize that our goal is not to make it take longer to travel from zone to zone. We're not looking to make things inconvenient or a big time sink, we want to make sure that you're getting where you need to go in as convenient of a way as we possibly can. We said this much at BlizzCon already and that still holds true.<br />
<br />
We will do our best to keep everyone as up to date on ongoing developments as we can.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Tweets<br />
Classes<br />
Venom Zest sounds cool. one thing I'm worried about is a talent having only a choice for 1 specific spec.<br />
We don't do that, there's always a choice in each slot for every spec. Venom Zest is for all 3 specs. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438128274548334592))<br />
I meant as an example for other talents. That one favors assassination for example. Works for others but preferred for X.<br />
A talent doesn't need to be exactly balanced between specs, just close. It needs to be well balanced against is its *row*. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438131759046074368))<br />
<br />
Art<br />
I know it's bit trivial in the broad scope but will the faction flight mounts get a model update? Wyverns/Bats look clunky<br />
I agree, this is another one of those-hope to, but can't get to soon enough desires. On the radar, no eta (artofcgrobinson (https://twitter.com/artofcgrobinson/status/431842471908093952))<br />
<br />
Proving Grounds<br />
silver proving grounds for heroics?? With what gear may I ask? I could not do silver until I had 520 ilevel, doing it with quest greens will be a joke. <br />
Proving Grounds normalizes your gear to 463s. Quest Greens would be hard, but anything 463+ should be fine. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/438037592131383297))<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
So, we're thinking of Tradeskills as a vector for high dedication. (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/433390185443627008))<br />
We'd like for there to be something to progress towards, even if you don't have access to high end raiding, (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/433390811045060608))<br />
(like, not part of a high end raiding guild, may not have the best internet connection, etc.) (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/433391148518735872))<br />
Something you can achieve as player who may not have access to those things, but who loves to play, and does so regularly. (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/433391771402260480))<br />
We try to tune things so that high intensity players don't feel like it's mandatory, however. How are we doing? (hwoome (https://twitter.com/hwoome/status/433392412182867969))<br />

Poll - Cross-Realm Siege of Orgrimmar Normal<br />
Would you like to see cross-realm Normal difficulty Siege of Orgrimmar enabled before Warlords of Draenor? This question came up in January (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3673-Normal-Cross-Realm-SoO-Jan-6-Hotfixes-Connected-Realm-Updates-Blue-Tweets-Fan-Art), before we had a Fall 2014 release date for Warlords of Draenor. <br />

Beta hasn't even started yet, it'll likely ramp up the closer we get to release. Right now they've got other things to focus on rather than mounts which are on the lower tier in terms of content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
probably the 2nd one. so we should expect 10 brand mount models and about 3 - 6 reskins for each. <br />
<br />
theres a new wolf model so that will likely be one<br />
they said theres a new talbuk model so that will probably be one<br />
theres the dragonfly mount so thats one <br />
<br />
there might be a new ellek mount.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ejpaints</div><div class="date">2014-03-14, 05:39 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">A lot of non info still coming. The fact that we're halfway thru March and beta hasn't even started is disconcerting. Pre raid discussion tonight confirmed to me that I'm just one of many on the brink of taking a break. We're bored and SoO till fall doesn't sound any less boring. A guild vacation to another game seems likely till WoD gets a bit closer. Hopefully people decide to come back by then. <br />
<br />
The cross realm SoO thing is unlikely as the tech currently won't let them do it with normal and not heroic. I honestly don't care bc I run heroics. Cross realm normal doesn't hurt me and it helps others. So if they can make it happen so be it. Raiders are starting to get thin. I don't imagine that issue is much better for normal mode so I don't see the harm in allowing it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Armored Water Strider<br />
2. Normal Cloud Serpent<br />
3. Thundering Cloud Serpent<br />
4. Heavenly Cloud Serpent<br />
5. Astral Cloud Serpent<br />
6. Amber Scorpion<br />
7. Shado-Pan Tiger<br />
8. Imperial Quilen<br />
9. Flying Cloud<br />
10. Dragon Turtle (Pandaren racial mount)<br />
11. Armored Dragon Turtle (Pandaren speed racial mount)<br />
12. Crane<br />
13. Goat<br />
14. Son of Galleon (regardless of it being bugged)<br />
15. Geosynchronous World Spinner<br />
16. the other Engineering mount<br />
17. Jeweled Panther<br />
18. Pandaren Kite<br />
19. Yak<br />
20. Traveler's Yak<br />
<br />
That doesn't even go into the color variations. WoD having 10 mounts isn't something to freak out over.<br />

<br />
you mean just like every other game developer in the world? <br />
<br />
money to make games doesnt just poof out of nowhere people. <br />
<br />
and each game has its own team, sometimes people move around different teams, and some people are on multiple teams but overall the development is all separate</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hey smartypants, what's the current ratio of &quot;store to in-game&quot; mounts look like, hmmm?<br />
<br />
Oh, there are ridiculously more in-game mounts in nigh every patch and tier than there are store mounts that are introduced once every two or three months? <br />
<br />
<br />
Still feeling smug?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Anyway... If Blizzard's goal is to make the world &quot;not inconvenient to get through without flying,&quot; I really fail to see how making a larger world, with flying, would somehow be &quot;too convenient&quot; if it's intended to be &quot;convenient&quot; in the first place. Dynamic events wont matter whether flying mounts are included or not, nor will exploring. World PvP is only marginally applicable.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also... No idea why anybody would have any reservations about making normal SoO (or heroic for that matter) cross-realm. There's really no reason to not allow it to be in full.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Aerna</div><div class="date">2014-03-14, 09:46 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Alas, unlikely. Tech limitation: pre-6.0, we actually can't make Normal x-realm without also doing so for Heroic.<br />

<br />
10 new mounts likely means several slightly different versions of each, like colours or attached armour/decorations. That's not so far from the norm when you think about the previous expansions. Yaks, Goats, Mushan, Dragon Turtles, Cloud Serpents, Giant Yak, Water Strider... probably forgot some from MoP launch but there's far more than 10 mounts from those archetypes I've just listed.</div></div><hr />

The cloud serpents are just slight variants of each other, ditto the two kinds of Dragon Turtle (which are up-polyed versions of the two older turtle mounts but we'll count that as &quot;new&quot;), the scorpion is a recolour of the scorpion mount introduced in Cata. Son of Galleon hardly counts as it's like 1/10,000 drop rate.<br />
<br />
So really 14 at the most for launch. Which by end of expansion was up to like 20ish. They will undoubtedly add more as WoD goes on.<br />

Burning Crusade released 7 years ago when the game was still young. At least it still managed to release with two full tiers of raids and 14 dungeons with heroic variations on top of that. We get one full raid tier and half as many dungeons these days because they're too busy working on items they can put in their Blizzard store to charge people for.</div></div><hr />

Can I give you the explanation or does it have to be someone with a blue text so you can whine at them about it?<br />
<br />
It would be stupid to release even beta at this point, because it would seriously harm success chance for their other products that are coming out (HS, diablo, their LoL). It is also good for the stock of Blizzard if they can get some players to move from WoW to their other games, so their customer base is diversified over more games, and not as susceptible to mass exodus because of bad design decisions or competing mmo game. Just remember that you are playing a game made by a company that has Kotick at the helm.</div></div><hr />

For some reason I have a feeling things like this will start to become more common. After spending 70$ for the x-pac, and our 15$ a month isn't that enough Blizz. Don't get me wrong I understand that the game needs to make money for continued support I'm just worried that soon the number of mount drops per x-pac will fall behind the number available in the Blizz store.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's just remove guilds while we're at it then. Because Heroic raiding is one of the few things left that actually gives a guild a purpose to play together. Besides, normal can be pretty easily facerolled. I don't see a lot of the heroic fights going well for cross realm groups not used to playing with one another. There is actually some coordination needed for those. And considering the flexes still have plenty of fail, I can only imagine the utter failure in heroic mode.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It pisses off a far greater number of players who have to stop raiding or transfer because of their guild/server collapsing. But then again, this environment has been created precisely for that...fuck everyone over so they have to transfer a bunch of toons and pay lots of money for it. (connected realms is simply a smokescreen to make it look like they care, when really they don't)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yep. :( The fanatical Blizzard defenders will likely be insisting otherwise right up until they go live, but I can't see those comments as anything but confirmation. Different faces are basically going to be a thing of the past. (Unless you zoom in and are good at hidden picture games :p) Ah well, wasn't really expecting anything different at this point anyway. <br />
<br />
Idk if WoD will be DOA or not, there's plenty of folks still around who salivate at any opportunity to give Blizzard their money, but it's certainly not looking like anything I want to do. From my perspective, it's got some negatives (stat reshuffle, absurd time-travel 'alternate reality' plotline, cash shop, overall apparent lack of content), stuff being hyped as 'features' that I'm just uninterested in (Garrisons, model revamps) and for pluses it's got more challenging healing and no-flying, and that's it. As others have said, it doesn't feel like a real expansion to me.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Try to understand why: <br />
<br />
1. No matter what your opinion is, someone's here to tell you that you're wrong. <br />
<br />
2. Blizzard has almost ten years now of smarmy BS answers and smarmy responses. <br />
<br />
3. No matter how bad some change seems to be to you personally, there's at least one person here who LOVES THE HELL OUT OF IT and will post saying so. They could literally write &quot;Patch 6.0, all mounts deleted from the game and 1 of every 10 players will be kidnapped and surgically neutered&quot; and someone would post what a great idea it was and how much they love it. <br />
<br />
Here's an example: I dislike being forced to raid 20 man if I want the best PVE gear in the game. I prefer difficult heroic 5 man dungeons. I think resilience is bullshit, because I remember in vanilla how everybody was at least a little dangerous. Now, people who PVP all the time get both the skill and the much more powerful gear so PVP is either something you do a lot or avoid like the plague. I think not being able to fly while leveling always has and always will suck ass. <br />
<br />

<br />
1. Hovering is NOT the same as the mount being a ground mount. Phoenixes, the Heart of the Aspects, Armored Bloodwing and so on look silly when hovering along the ground. Give them all ground run and walk and idle animations to make it proper.<br />

2. Mounts with huge wings, such as the Pureblood Fire Hawk and Proto-drakes, could benefit from being given the same idle animation as the Skyscreamer/Dread Raven mounts in order to &quot;clean up&quot; a bit. Especially proto-drake wings take up a lot of space &lt;.&lt;.</div></div><hr />

I guess people will have to bitch about it in beta before they take it seriously as a horrible idea. <br />

It is amazing to me that a company can float an idea that half of their customers openly hate and somehow say its a great idea. Flying in WoD is going to be v2.0 of the Cataclysm Heroics disaster. They must see it coming, why they are not fixing it now is beyond me. <br />

They should stick with the model they have had in Wrath. Flying at or near max level once you get there, and flying on your alts for leveling up once you hit max one time.</div></div><hr />
