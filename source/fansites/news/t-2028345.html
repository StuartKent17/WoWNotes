Legion - Havoc Demon Hunter Spell Animations<br />
With the pre-expansion patch approaching and new spell animations mostly finalized, we are going back and finishing up our series of previews.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Preview: Wardrobe Updates<br />
The World of Warcraft: Legion pre-expansion patch is coming soon, and that means a great number of changes and improvements to the game are on their way. We’ve recently outlined several reasons to get ready for it all here and here.<br />
<br />
Today, we’re opening up the walk-in closet of wardrobe updates and looking around at what’s in store for your character’s looks.<br />
<br />
<br />
&lt;iframe width=&quot;853&quot; height=&quot;480&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/dVGrr0UvXQ8?rel=0&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;<br />
<br />
Bound to Look Good<br />
With the Legion pre-expansion patch, every piece of gear that is bound to your character permanently unlocks that item’s appearance for you. Even if you sell or destroy the item, you’ll always be able to look through the new Appearances tab in the Collections window to find its look.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/thumb/wardrobeOP01.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/wardrobeOP01.jpg) <br />
<br />
There are several ways to look through all of the Appearances—take note of the icons across the top of the window, and select any of them to narrow the displayed looks. As you page through the looks you’ve unlocked, you’ll also see looks that you haven’t unlocked yet with a grey frame around them. Right-click on any look that you have unlocked to set it as a favorite, which promotes it to the first page of your collection.<br />
<br />
Above the item-type icons, there’s a handy search field.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/thumb/wardrobeOP02.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/wardrobeOP02.jpg) <br />
<br />
Type anything you like in the search field to filter the items displayed even further.<br />
<br />
Trying Things On<br />
To put change how you look, you’ll need to visit a Transmogrification vendor. You’ll notice that the Transmogrification vendor’s interface has been completely updated with a new look and new features.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/thumb/wardrobeOP03.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/wardrobeOP03.jpg) <br />
<br />
Now, when you select a gear slot, you’ll see a preview of all of the different looking gear that your character can apply to the look of that slot. Go through as many as you like, then select ‘Apply’, and you’re done. You can save different looks as ‘Outfits’, so you can return later and change into a different Outfit anytime. Save a different Outfit for each of your different specializations, and when you change specs, your Outfit will automatically change, too!<br />
<br />
A Beautifully Big Adventure<br />
Now that you know how you want to look, don’t forget that the Adventure Journal is there for you. The Loot tab in the Adventure Journal is the place to look for full sets of gear, or amazing Legendary items, and where to find them.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/thumb/wardrobeOP04.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/wardrobeOP04.jpg) <br />
<br />
Don’t overlook the buttons on the top right of the Loot tab. You can click on them and then drop down to filter the item sets by specialization, and the Legendary items by class, specialization, and slot. Hold down the control key and click on each of the parts of an item set to open a Dressing Room window and see how you’ll look once you’ve collected that set.<br />
<br />
As you mouseover each item, a message at the bottom of that item’s tooltip will tell you whether you’ve collected it yet. From anywhere in the Adventure Guide, you can type the name of a piece of gear into the search bar, and you’ll be taken right to the page of the guide for the Dungeon and Boss that drops that item.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/thumb/wardrobeOP05.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/june/wardrobeOP05.jpg) <br />
<br />
It feels good to look good.<br />
<br />

PTR Character Copy Disabled<br />
Towards the end of testing in a milestone we begin to flag builds as 'Release' versions, so we can test a game client that more closely matches the behavior of the live retail version of the game. Release versions don't change much in terms of content for public testers, however certain test features will be disabled, in this case: in-game Character Copy functionality.<br />
<br />
Character Copy was disabled in the build we released earlier this week and will likely remain disabled for the remainder of 7.0.3 PTR testing. Existing characters will not be affected and Character Copy will return after at a later date.<br />
<br />
I would also like to thank everyone who helped us test 7.0.3 on the PTR. Your continued feedback and reports help make World of Warcraft a fun and rewarding experience for all!<br />
<br />
<br />
Beta Launch Test July 15 4:30 p.m. PDT<br />
Today, July 15, we’re going to test launching Legion with the Legion Beta, and we’d appreciate your help.<br />
<br />
At about 4:00 p.m. PDT, we’ll take the Beta down for a few minutes to prepare. Then, at 4:30 p.m. PDT, we’ll bring the Beta up for testers to log in. Players will need to login with a new character using the ‘Legion Launch Test’ template that will be available. During this time, any characters they above level 100 won’t be accessible. Once enough players have logged in, we will begin broadcasting server messages to indicate that Legion is about to go “live”.<br />
<br />
As the expansion “launches”, you will be automatically prompted with new quests to start your adventures in Legion. Please follow them through to conclusion, and play through your class Order Hall opening quests. This will give us a useful look at our live launch.<br />
<br />
We need your help identifying issues, and we’ll be looking for your feedback on the test launch in this thread and via in-game bug reports.<br />
<br />
Thank you very much!<br />
<br />

Blue Posts<br />
Game Balance and Communication<br />
So, apparently there is a lot of behind the scene tuning and changes happening. Thats great!<br />
<br />
But some of us would like to know what is happening, when it happens. We don't see template changes, we don't see ability changes.<br />
<br />
Things like the interrupt reduction for shadow and shaman are invisible and unkown to any player that hasn't read the forum post back in alpha and probably wonders why interrupts last shorter on these specs. And this is just an example. There is no UI element or passive buff or anything. It is invisible.<br />
<br />
I know this is still beta but are there any plans to make these things more visible?<br />
I'm preparing a very large post for these forums on this issue. Stay tuned. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/417189-lack-of-communcation-and-visibility-about-changes/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/20747164695?page=1#4))<br />
<br />
Stealth Breaking<br />
We've added a combat log line when Stealth breaks, and it should show what spell or ability caused Stealth to be removed. If you run into abilities that you feel shouldn't break Stealth and do, please create a bug report with the ability.<br />
<br />
This is considered an 'Aura Dispel' in the combat log filter settings, so the easiest way to look for these is to create a new filter, and only have 'Done To: Me', and 'Aura' 'Dispels' selected.<br />

earliest you could even hope for is the 26th, realistically though you are looking at 2nd or 9th. I am personally hoping it is the 2nd at the latest so we have plenty of time to do pre-patch events.</div></div><hr />

In an earlier post, Blizzard said that there would be a demon invasion to start some time after the prepatch launched, and that the invasions would intensify a week later, and again a week after that.<br />
<br />
Expansion launch is Aug 30. If the third (final) invasion wave lasts for 1 week, it would go live on Aug 23. If the second invasion wave lasts for 1 week, it would go live Aug 16. If the first invasion wave lasts for 1 week, it would therefore have to go live Aug 9. Since there will be time after the prepatch launches but before the invasion, the prepatch will launch no later than Aug 2. But hopefully at least one of the aforementioned intervals will be 2 weeks, meaning the prepatch would drop on July 26.<br />
<br />
An early release may seem unlikely (we all know how Blizzard likes to wait Until It's Ready™), but if they do release early, that gives them more time between prepatch release and expansion launch to identify and tweak issues, since they'll have several million players all attacking the new features at once, rather than the beta players, who are an order of magnitude smaller in number. That approach would leave them with a slightly stronger product on Aug 30 than if they released the prepatch later.<br />
<br />
I, for one, cannot wait to get these 6,000 salvage boxes out of my characters' inventories.</div></div><hr />

What makes you think it won't be on tuesday? The pre patch for every single expansion have always landed the same week that the arena season ends.<br />

<br />
Sadly, no. I'm not sure why the narrator isn't more clear on that. Either this video was from an earlier iteration, or they just couldn't script it as snappily...<br />
<br />
Either way, as I understand it there's two major caveats the narrator did not include. One, as you're asking, is that the soulbound item MUST be something you can use. This includes armour, which has to be your primary armour type to work. Plate wearers will only be able to collect plate appearances, etc. <br />
<br />
Two, the narrator says that the items from all the quests you've ever done will be added. This is not entirely correct: it's all the quest items that your character could have used/equipped. IE, if your druid completed a quest with two leather items and an axe, the druid unlocks both leather items, but not the axe. A warrior would get the axe, but not the leather.</div></div><hr />

Yep. As noted by some of the peaks Blizzard has given us, we will get more cool stuff unlocked as time gets closer to the expansion. Weeks before it goes live, we will have invasions and early access to Demon Hunters. That's all part of the pre-patch still. It doesn't go anywhere :)</div></div><hr />

So then let's say, you do an old school raid, you're a Warlock, and you don't get a single piece of &quot;equipable&quot; gear...NONE of<br />
those items you picked up will have their appearances unlocked?</div></div><hr />

Exactly. If the lock doesn't get any drops for cloth, daggers, etc., they won't unlock the appearances.<br />
<br />
It keeps warriors from being the single best class to do everything on, since otherwise the only thing they could not unlock would be wands.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No its not, the system isnt made to make it easier to gain transmogs, its there to make it easier to manage the ones you have.<br />
<br />
Anything you could transmog before, you can transmog now.<br />
<br />
Warrior can only unlock plate armor, Hunter/shaman mail armor, druid etc leather and so forth.<br />
<br />
No one class has any benefit over another, and you cant unlock anything you couldnt before, its common sense.</div></div><hr />

You couldn't equip the items, but you could still unlock them for your other classes.<br />
<br />
The way its set up now is barely different from before. Its still as grindy as it ever was, which fucking sucks.<br />
They had a chance to make it less so, and opted not to, which is why its fucking shit on their part.<br />
<br />
It SHOULD be whatever item you acquire has its appearance unlocked, not whatever item you acquire that<br />
you can equip.</div></div><hr />
