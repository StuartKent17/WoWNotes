The last class getting a preview this week is the mage! Paladins will have to wait next friday for their preview (see this post (http://www.mmo-champion.com/news-2/cataclysm-class-information-coming!/) for more information). <br />
<br />
Keep in mind that this is the only the beginning, things will get pretty wild in the next days and weeks!<br />
<br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, we’ll be making lots of changes and additions to class talents and abilities across the board. In this preview, you’ll get an early look at what's in store for the mage class, including a rundown of some of the new spells, abilities, and talents, and an overview of how the new Mastery system will work with the different talent specs.<br />
<br />
New Mage Spells<br />
<br />
Flame Orb (available at level 81): Inspired by Prince Taldaram’s abilities in Ahn'kahet and Icecrown Citadel, this spell allows the mage to cast a flaming orb that travels in front in a straight line, sending beams that cause fire damage to passing targets. Once it’s cast, the mage is free to begin casting other spells as the Flame Orb travels. While the spell will be useful to any spec, Fire mages will have talents that improve it, possibly causing the Flame Orb to explode when it reaches its destination.<br />
<br />
Time Warp (level 83): Grants a passive Haste effect much like Bloodlust or Heroism to party or raid members. It also temporarily increases the mage's own movement speed. Time Warp will be exclusive with Bloodlust and Heroism, meaning you can’t benefit from both if you’ve got the Exhaustion debuff, though the movement-speed increase will still work even when under the effects of Exhaustion.<br />
<br />
Wall of Fog (level 85): Creates a line of frost in front of the mage, 30 yards from end to end. Enemies who cross the line are snared and take damage. The mana cost will be designed to make Wall of Fog efficient against groups, not individuals. This spell is intended to give mages a way to help control the battlefield, whether the mage is damaging incoming enemies (Blizzard can be channeled on top of Wall of Fog) or protecting a flag in a Battleground. 10-second duration. 30-second cooldown.<br />
<br />
Changes to Abilities and Mechanics<br />
<br />
In addition to introducing new spells, we're planning to make changes to some of the other abilities and mechanics you're familiar with. This list and the summary of talent changes below it are by no means comprehensive, but they should give you a good sense of what we intend for each spec.<br />
<br />
Arcane Missiles is being redesigned to become a proc-based spell. Whenever the mage does damage with any spell, there is a chance for Arcane Missiles to become available, similar to how the warrior’s Overpower works. The damage and mana cost of this spell will be reworked to make it very desirable to use when available. This change should make gameplay more dynamic for the mage, particularly at low levels.<br />
<br />
We are planning to remove spells that don't have a clear purpose. Amplify Magic, Dampen Magic, Fire Ward, and Frost Ward are being removed from the game, and we may remove more.<br />
<br />
The ability to conjure food and water will not become available until higher levels (likely around level 40), as we're making changes to ensure mages generally won’t run out of mana at lower levels. Once mages learn how to conjure food and water, the conjured item will restore both health and mana.<br />
<br />
Scorch will provide a damage bonus to the mage's fire spells. Our goal is for Scorch to be part of the mage's rotation and a useful damage-dealing ability, even if someone else is supplying the group with the spell Critical Strike debuff. Scorch will provide the mage with more specific benefits, which can also be improved through talents.<br />
<br />
<br />
New Talents and Talent Changes<br />
<br />
Arcane Focus will now return mana for each spell that fails to hit your target, including Arcane Missiles that fail to launch. We want Arcane mages to have several talents that play off of how much mana the character has and give the player enough tools to manage mana.<br />
<br />
The talent Playing with Fire will reduce the cooldown of Blast Wave when hit by a melee attack, instead of its current effect.<br />
<br />
Pyromaniac will grant Haste when three or more targets are getting damaged by the effects of your damage-over-time (DoT) fire spells.<br />
<br />
The Burnout talent will allow mages to cast spells using health when they run out of mana.<br />
<br />
<br />
Mastery Passive Talent Tree Bonuses<br />
<br />
Arcane<br />
Spell damage<br />
Spell Haste<br />
Mana Adept<br />
<br />
Mana Adept: Arcane will deal damage based how much mana the mage has. For example, Arcane mages will do much more damage at 100% mana than at 50% mana. If they begin to get low on mana, they will likely want to use an ability or mechanic to bring their mana up to increase their damage.<br />
<br />
Fire<br />
Spell damage<br />
Spell Crit<br />
Ignite<br />
<br />
Ignite: All direct-damage fire spells will add a damage-over-time (DoT) component when cast. The flavor will be similar to how Fireball works; however, the DoT component will be much stronger.<br />
<br />
Frost<br />
Spell damage<br />
Spell Crit damage<br />
Deathfrost<br />
<br />
Deathfrost: Casting Frostbolt places a buff on the mage that increases the damage for all frost, fire, and arcane spells. The only damage spell that won't be affected by this buff is Frostbolt.<br />
<br />
We hope you enjoyed this preview, and we’re looking forward to hearing your initial thoughts and feedback on these additions and changes. Please keep in mind that this information represents a work in progress and is subject to change as development on Cataclysm continues.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Yea i was always confused about what frost and fire ward did. Never made any sense. <br />
*facepalm*<br />
<br />
<br />
Fire ward sucked up fire dmg and frost sucked up frost damage. Pretty obvious :/.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
Very cool! I remember Pre-BC mage leveling.<br />

That food change is a big deal!! That sucks for leveling mages.</div></div><hr />

But I suppose it makes sense that someone gets it. Was expecting Warriors, though.<br />
<br />
The third Arcane Mastery is... interesting, to say the very least. Not to mention the whole setup with Arcane Missiles and Scorch. Looks like they're trying to have more inter-classial (for lack of a better term) play for Mages.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Rinako</div><div class="date">2010-04-10, 07:07 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Those are some pretty solid changes. I lol'd at heroism/bloodlust, but I guess it makes for some good times haha. I've always loved playing arcane over the other specs (even when it wasn't popular) and I really like the mastery effect. Flame orbs seem interesting, and gives us another AoE ability, although I question its utility. <br />
<br />
I have to say, wall of fog sounds really interesting, but I am trying to think of a good application of it in a PvE setting.</div></div><hr />

WHY!?! Look at Frost's passive bonuses.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ecca2</div><div class="date">2010-04-10, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Interesting changes. Seems Fire's getting alot of attention, while Arcane is being reworked to be more than just ABx4&gt;MBAM on loop for single-target damage. And not only will Arcane mages want mana-restoration for continuous AB casts, but also for the Mana Adept mastery bonus. I like it so far.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">gnomon</div><div class="date">2010-04-10, 07:08 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I always use fire/frost wards in PvP along with dampen magic. Amplify magic is used on Saurfang (pure physical dps fights) and Dreamwalker. I don't see why these abilities are being removed. Wall of Fog? As if we need more crowd control in arena...</div></div><hr />

The one thing that i'm kinda bummed about is losing frost ward and fire ward. I have to say i would use those quite often either in pvp or some boss fights. But other than that i think the new spells are going to be awesome! And the new arcane missile proc on spells along with the better DoT from fire spells will be pretty cool. It seems that we will have reason to use just about every spell we have. It makes things for us mages much more fun.</div></div><hr />

You should give warlocks totems. That way everything we could ever possible bring to a group is filled by another class.<br />
SOE? we'll take horn.<br />
WF? we'll take icy talons.<br />
Hex? we'll take poly.<br />
Lust? we'll take a lust that increases our movement speed instead.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Yes I realize that Lust wasn't removed from the shaman's spell book. you know what I mean.</div></div><hr />

For once in my WoW-life, you made a facinating change for mages.<br />
It may not be the greatest thing ever, but you did it. You threw us a bone:<br />
You considered mages for once.<br />
<br />
Somehow, I always sort of knew. Something within me always said &quot;soon. Maybe even next patch! It'll happen.&quot;<br />
I knew it would come. I waited patch after patch, but I never lost hope, I believed in you, Blizzard. I believe in you.<br />
Now we get heroism/bloodlust and a fog thing?<br />
<br />
Thank you Blizzard.<br />
Thank you for acknowledging our existence.</div></div><hr />

All I can say is this so far is probably the best preview any class has had and they really have done something good for us.<br />
<br />
All 3 spells are good and have use another defensive CD on a low CD for ALL SPECs is a very good thing.<br />
<br />
Flame orb is interesting and I like the idea.<br />
<br />
Giving Bloodlust to another class is absolutely awesome, giving it to mages specifically is incredibly awesome.<br />
<br />
This really is a decent raid utility buff and it looks like a large change to how fire spec is played. <br />

No real mention of frost so far, but these preview ideas they have are all incredibly good so far.</div></div><hr />

I really doubt mana shielding will ever be worth it, especially considering the mastery for the arcane tree letting us do more damage when we have more mana.

<br />
Flame Orb sounds like a cool ability visually, but did Mages really need another AoE? I just don't see how it will fit into a rotation that is already monopolized by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Time Warp... well they had to give it to someone, it was a problem that only Shaman had BL/Hero. I wasn't expecting Mage honestly (I thought they'd give Druids a roar with that effect), but I guess it's nice. Mages didn't really need another group buff to get raid invites as their damage was already good enough to gain spots. It looks like Mages will be the kings of utility for heroics in Cata, if they actually do bring CC use back.<br />
<br />
Wall of Fog, IMO, is just pure awesomeness. Control of the battlefield is the Mage's specialty, but since Poly was so easy to dispel, this brings back that niche in a really cool way. For dungeons/raids, I can see this as being really REALLY fun for situations where there's an untanked group running to engage you, especially if you have the confidence to do some Blizzards on them while they're snared.<br />
<br />
Mana Adept I'm loving, but it's going to make arcane a very complicated spec to play. Do you go to 4AB stacks and gain damage that way, or do you stay at 3 to conserve mana and gain damage THAT way (or prevent damage loss, rather)? I hope that they will give arcane Mages more interesting tools to control Mana if this goes live - Mana Gems and Evocate work for keeping arcane from running dry, but they don't make for interesting gameplay.<br />
<br />
Deathfrost I'm confused about. Correct me if I'm wrong, but currently frost's rotation is basically just spamming Frostbolt with Ice Lance, Deep Freeze, and Fireball used based on cooldown/procs. With Deathfrost you're going to want to cast Frostbolt once and then switch to using another spell... but what is that other spell? I'm lost...<br />
<br />
Finally, I'm not sure I like the idea of AM becoming a proc. For early levels it's awesome, but how will that work with the arcane rotation? Is Missle Barrage being removed, or when you're at an ABx4 stack, are you going to be fishing for both an MB and an AM proc to happen?</div></div><hr />

First, the shammies get supposedly the 'best' preview yet. Then, blizzard slaps them in the face by giving their hero/bloodlust away to another class!!<br />

<br />
Assuming it works exactly like the wotlk spell it should chase the target hopefully over any distance. <br />
<br />
Wall of fog will be another powerful tool against melee, a 30second CD allows it to be used fairly frequently in BGs and combined with frost spec in its current there will be nearly no excuse for melee to close the gap. <br />
<br />
Bloodlust is fairly obvious, losing the wards is a pain but Im sure it will be made up for. <br />
<br />
Another big one is the weaving arcane missiles into frost/fire rotations, Im wondering what will be reworked to make them more desirable. <br />
<br />
Im also all for increasing scorches damage and making it provide another tangible self buff for the mage.<br />
<br />
HP into manaish is interesting, kind of warlockish but I wont complain obviously. <br />

<br />
Think of a non-enforced CC(enforced CC sucks in a PvP MMO IMO BTW) force people to step aside or eat painful amount of damage. This idea also apply to warrior's new &quot;stand or bleed&quot;(forgot the name) skill.<br />

I just don't see how it will fit into a rotation that is already monopolized by Blizzard.<br />
<br />
Most of the abilities that have been added in seem to focus more around PvP than anything else. This is a good example of that because Flame Orb will more than likely never be able to replace Blizzard. It'll be hard to control and if you talent it, it will explode after a certain point so you'll need to figure out when that happens. Now imagine using it in a BG in a crowded area... you've got a giant ball of flaming death shooting fiery lasers at everyone and if you spec'd Fire, it's a portable bomb too!<br />
<br />

Well... it looks like, if you want to use &quot;Deathfrost&quot; to its full advantage, you'll have to switch to using a spell other than Frostbolt when it procs.</div></div><hr />

Wall of fog, pretty sick, but is it accurate? If its area of effect that it better be a big area, not some straight line, it'd be a fail game of frost bowling. <br />

Correct me if I'm wrong, but currently frost's rotation is basically just spamming Frostbolt with Ice Lance, Deep Freeze, and Fireball used based on cooldown/procs. With Deathfrost you're going to want to cast Frostbolt once and then switch to using another spell... but what is that other spell? I'm lost...<br />
<br />
I have a few theories. This could be Blizzard's way of bringing Frostfire Bolt into the Deep Frost rotation and let's not forget about Arcane Missiles. We don't know how it's going to be changed but that's another possibility.</div></div><hr />

Sounds like they do want to nerf us with this. If your mana drops too low, so will your DPS. At the same time though, I believe it will be adding damage on top of what we already do. It shouldn't be too difficult to keep your mana up though... hopefully. Cataclysm IS bringing a lot of changes.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, seems like a stupid change. Will just encourage people to either stick to the most mana efficient rotation because losing mana means too much of a damage loss, or to just ignore this thing because doing more damage makes up for it. Somebody on EJ will work out the best rotation and nobody will care or remember that Mana Adept exists.<br />
<br />
Otherwise the changes are just more pvp crap, except overall there's not much of a buff with the loss of wards. Couldn't care less, nothing to see here from a pve pov.<br />
<br />
And lol@shamans. Why should you get carried into a raid because you bring heroism? Get in on merit. You know, the thing mages have been doing for years because we bring no unique buffs?</div></div><hr />

Our mastery system is awesome. <br />
<br />
As you posted and I was about to yes deathfrost will be there to very likely bring Frostfire bolt into the rotation.<br />
<br />
Someone else posted about the wall of fog, its going to be a straight line 30yrd in length judging from what the blues have wrote, that's not an insignificant size even if it isn't wide.<br />
<br />
Used poorly it will be completely ineffective IE used in a position where the people will end up at the end of the wall anyway, but it is largely a RBG ability and quite possibly an incredibly effective one.<br />
<br />
Back to deathfrost obviously there isnt going to be a viable hybrid frost/fire spec but deathfrost should bridge the gap with enough buffs to frostfire bolt to make it viable. Especially if frost is a crit heavy spec. <br />
<br />
Will frost be a viable PVE spec will be another question.<br />
<br />
But I am really hoping that fire becomes viable in PVP.</div></div><hr />

If Blizzard are happy with a given classes' damage abilities and rotations, then they bloody well shouldn't be adding new damages or heals or whatever to try and fill niches that aren't there just to appease people who only care about numbers. Situational and unique abilities are AWESOME.<br />

Speaking of pvp. Fire and frost ward were pure skill testers which rewarded reaction time and adaptive thinking.

Sigh, I hope not. We'll see how well Shaman get buffed for Cataclysm, because giving another class our Heroism/Bloodlust is pretty retarded, they want to steer away from homogenization yet they go and do this.<br />

Mage AoE is kinda archaic and throwing more AoE spells on top of what we already have isn't the solution, but both of these sound like they'll be fun. Flaming Laser Death Orbs and a terminal case of clamminess. I would like to see Arcane actually get some synergy with their own AoE spell, Arcane Explosion, as there are no talents in Arcane that boost it in relation to the FS9-FS8-Blizzard rotation that mages have cobbled together from the old vanilla spells.<br />
<br />
Time Warp - Well, awesome. Mages suffered from a lack of nearly any desirable raid buffs for quite a while. Arcane Empowerment is a very recent change, but ret pallies are a dime a dozen and it doesn't stack with them. Arcane Intellect is just lol-worthy, buff it or scrap it at this point. Scorch could be nice but Warlocks were always better at providing it, even now that mages don't have to build five stacks of it and glyph for it, and it's still not a part of the Fire mage rotation for any reason other than to keep the debuff up. Sorry Shammies - look on the bright side, you still have exclusivity on Wrath of Air buff AFAIK and I love that totem.<br />
<br />
The Arcane Missiles proc is going to be interesting, I want more information - I don't want to be forced to drop stacks with Barrage (blech) because I can't get AM to proc. That's especially the case with the Arcane Mastery Mana Adept.<br />
<br />
Sad to see Fire &amp; Frost Ward going away. Frost Warding absorbs were an awful lot of fun.<br />
<br />
All in all? Much, much happier with this than I was with the changes my Warrior is seeing. Cheers.<br />
<br />
Edit: Actually, since Spell Power is going away and being replaced by Intellect come Cata, Arcane Intellect will actually do more than add a tiny sliver to already bottomless manapools. I'd be fine with Shammies (or some other class) getting something like it then.</div></div><hr />

I think it's valid to mention that the movement speed increasing component is for the mage only (and can be accessed even if a shaman has already used BL/Hero). The raid-wide buff is, or most likely will be at least, exactly the same. The only contention I have is that I think the tying of both effects into one spell - especially when the spell has such a long cooldown - is awkward.</div></div><hr />

You do realize that the movement speed buff is mage only? So everyone else gets the same buff as Heroism, plus the mage that casted it can move faster. So it's equivalent from the other members perspective.<br />
<br />
&quot;It also temporarily increases the mage's own movement speed.&quot;</div></div><hr />

we aren't really sure what the cooldown for this spell is. it could be shorter than bloodlust since the sated/exhausted debuff is enough to ensure that the haste effect doesn't get abused.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Honestly... I'll take it for those situations when a shaman is just not available.. but its nothing special and doesn't get the respect of being a fancy +80 talent that everything else has been in these previews. Short version: meh<br />
<br />
Wall of Fog (level 85): <br />
<br />
I LOVE this one if blizzard can build it correctly. My two biggest concerns is if it has any affect on casting (unlikely) and is it good defense against warriors (charge / leap) or death grip or blessing of freedom. I hope this can trump those other abilities. Give me 10 seconds of freedom to cast without someone getting in my face! Seriously the only thing better would be if this was an ice wall that literally caused line of sight and blocked people without being destroyable or hope of being dispelled.<br />
<br />
The changes to spells and the mastery all sound very interesting. Arcane and Fire are fairly strait forward but frost is interesting. Deathfrost as they call it, I wonder if its going to be a consumable buff or a duration buff. But all in all may we be finally see three raiding tree's???</div></div><hr />

This. They were useful sometimes in both PvE and PvP. Smart Mages would use the wards against other Mages. Also if a raid boss is dealing physical damage (like Marrowgar), Mages would use Ampify Magic to increase the healing income to tanks, but they wouldn't take more spell damage if they get out of the fire.</div></div><hr />

Frost ward and fire ward? Blizzard is on crack. I will not sit there and pop my mana shield to absorb 10% of the incoming damage at 30% of my mana bar. Either royally change how mages can passively stop incoming spell damage or fix our shields. I want to see something like the OP priest shields that cost next to nothing but absorb 80% of the damage you throw at them.</div></div><hr />

Taken from the link you provided:Defense of the Ancients (DotA) is a custom scenario for the real-time strategy video game Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos and its expansion, Warcraft III: The Frozen Throne, based on the &quot;Aeon of Strife&quot; map for StarCraft. Warcraft III is the third title in the Warcraft series of real-time strategy games developed by Blizzard Entertainment. As with Warcraft II, Blizzard included a free &quot;world editor&quot; in the game that allows players to create custom scenarios or &quot;maps&quot; for the game, which can be played online with other players through Battle.net.The scenario was developed with the &quot;World Editor&quot; of Warcraft III: Reign of Chaos, and was updated upon the release of the expansion, The Frozen Throne.<br />
<br />
now im not the smartest person out there but some guy took blizzards software created a custom game from it and its considered not be the property of blizzard somehow? it doesn't matter if they renamed the spell it was still created by blizzard.</div></div><hr />

Open a Dungeons&amp;Dragons handbook and find all those spells there. Claiming that Blizzard is &quot;stealing&quot; from DOTA is ridiculous. All these spells are not new at all. Plus, DOTA is created on Warcraft III engine (Wasn't a custom map at first? I only played ladder, so can't remember), so it's just being silly, really.<br />

1) no. please re-read better.<br />
<br />
2) no. Yes technically they work over an area but when people talk AoE people are refering to high-damage dealing spells not crowd controlling spells. So of the two new abilities ones AoE the others CC. <br />
<br />
But yet according to your math we have 7 currently? Blizzard, Cone of Cold, Flame Strike, Dragons-Breath, Arcane Explosion, and assuming you even threw the CC ability Frost Nova in that count.. that's only 6. Am I missing one?<br />

<br />
Arcane Exp, Blast Wave, Blizzard, Flame Strike, Cone of Cold, Living Bomb are considered AoE DAMAGE Spells. As well as Wall of Fog, Flame Orb.<br />
Blast Wave, Blizzard, CoC, Dragon's Breath, Wall of Fog, Flame Orb (if its slow moving you will move to avoid it) and Frost Nova, OUR CC AoE Spells.<br />
<br />
Wait... are you saying.. wait.. that... We DONT have a bloated over crowded amount of AoE? REALLY? Are you that stupid to think otherwise? <br />
<br />
REALLY?! I honestly have not met anyone more stupid if you think we dont have too much AOE's and that we are not bloated with AoEs.<br />
<br />
REALLY.<br />
<br />
You MUST be joking to think that having 10 AoE's isnt stupid.<br />
<br />
I find it redundant as well as pathetic.</div></div><hr />

It wasn't. You got any idea how many custom made spells there are in dota?<br />

@Dergo, I made no comment about where the spell was stolen from.<br />

Well, they still haven't done the ultimate talent ability in each tree.<br />

So my hopes of fire mages getting a temporary phoenix summon still exist somewhat.<br />

<br />
It is Mage-Only, so for the rest of the raid Time Warp = Heroism/Bloodlust, no difference at all.<br />
<br />
Also - how much do you move after starting Heroism/Bloodlust? Not at all FFS! Moving, even if you move faster, will reduce your dps in a phase where you should go all fucking out.<br />
<br />
So in 9 out of 10 cases you use Time Warp and then you stand fucking still for the entire duration except when you HAVE to move becuase of an AoE. In that case it'll be a miniscule DPS increase because you get to your new location one second earlier... oh yeah... overpowered..... -.- <br />
So what's the goddamn problem?<br />
<br />
I'm not too fond of Time Warp, pretty much every raid already has a shaman (they can fill 2 roles after all, 3 if we're counting melee vs ranged), we're running with at least one in each raid. So this great new ability makes no fuckig difference, we're essentially one new ability short compared to the other classes.<br />
Honestly, what raid does not have at least one shaman? The only time this spell will be used will be when the shaman unexpectedly dies and thus can't use Heroism/Bloodlust. Yay.... awesome, thanks for this new spell that we will be able to use like once every week...</div></div><hr />

You should give warlocks totems. That way everything we could ever possible bring to a group is filled by another class.<br />
SOE? we'll take horn.<br />
WF? we'll take icy talons.<br />
Hex? we'll take poly.<br />
Lust? we'll take a lust that increases our movement speed instead.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Yes I realize that Lust wasn't removed from the shaman's spell book. you know what I mean.<br />

if you want to homogenize classes don't keep unique buffs. In cata if there will be a choice between taking a dps shaman or a mage. the raid leader would take the mage for the Int Buff.<br />
<br />
If I was the raid leader, I'd go for the best player.<br />
<br />
I think it's good that an other class gets bloodlust, doesn't matter which one it was. Nowadays, you MUST have a shaman, just for the lust. I remember we had an ICC10 going on. We had a quite good group, but we had one spot open and we were missing a shaman. Of course we had to take a decent shaman, instead of a good dps. <br />
It's against Blizzard's philosophy, bring the class, not the player...</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Time Warp is nice :)<br />
- Wall of Fog can have it's uses in Battlegrounds, but I don't see it as useful in Arena or PvE. So meh.<br />
- Flame Orb, looks cool, but what should we do with it? I don't really see it beeing usefull in any situation. People will just step aside, and mobs are usually not stand in a line before the mage. It can be fun when 6 mages stand next to each other and cast Flame Orb simultaniously, clearing the battlefield :D<br />

If u can't see it's use in Arenas, than it means, u suck at PvP.</div></div><hr />

''Marty, we need to go back!&quot;<br />

On a serious note, new additions seem to be pretty awesome. Though, i'd prefer to see Frozen Orb with a slow effect and Fire Wall with a knockback effect instead of Flame Orb and Wall of Fog. And I kinda expected something like Meteor from Diablo but you can't have everything. Still puzzled over Arcane, though. Longing to see the last tier talents.</div></div><hr />

Once it’s cast, the mage is free to begin casting other spells as the Flame Orb travels. While the spell will be useful to any spec, Fire mages will have talents that improve it, possibly causing the Flame Orb to explode when it reaches its destination.<br />
<br />
This will suck in pvp, straight direction. It will be good in PVE, ONLY if it does like 20000000000000k dmg when it actually reaches boss or oadds to do dmg. Cos lets face it, half the time adds don't run at us.<br />
<br />

Time Warp will be exclusive with Bloodlust and Heroism, meaning you can’t benefit from both if you’ve got the Exhaustion debuff, though the movement-speed increase will still work even when under the effects of Exhaustion.<br />
<br />
Basically a rip-off of heroism. Idea of this = bring mages to WF kills, they also bring Heroism.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Wall of Fog (level 85): Creates a line of frost in front of the mage, 30 yards from end to end. Enemies who cross the line are snared and take damage. The mana cost will be designed to make Wall of Fog efficient against groups, not individuals. This spell is intended to give mages a way to help control the battlefield, whether the mage is damaging incoming enemies (Blizzard can be channeled on top of Wall of Fog) or protecting a flag in a Battleground. 10-second duration. 30-second cooldown.<br />
<br />
This is basically like the hunter frost trap for slowing enemies, but they take dmg too, most likely won't be &quot;enough&quot; dmg.<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all, I cant wait for changes, but it looks like to me they are just ripping off other talents and giving them to mages. Whilst some classes recieve new talents such as Efflorescence (rDruid), Thrash (fDruid), Wild Mushroom(Boomkin), Camouflage (Hunter), Smoke Bomb (Rogue), Necrotic Strike + Dark Simulacrum(DK), Gushing Wound (Warrior).<br />
<br />
I dont want to sound greedy since well other classes are getting rip-offs of Frostfire Bolt, Focus Magic etc</div></div><hr />

Heroism well people are so happy about, dunno what is suck there to be happy about. Tell me exactly what do you personally gain from it expect that you will find pugs faster, and start faster as u wont have to search for shammys. Otherwise i don`t really care about it, but its not something i was hoping for.<br />
<br />
Hmm from reading it all, and then re-reading again and again it seems we are going back to fire. Well im not stating anything as this is just a first glance of changes, but if everything goes in the direction as this first glance, then yes we will probably go back to fire.<br />
<br />
Wall of fog, hmm pvp skill yes, dont see it in pve as a commonly used spell.<br />
<br />
Flame orb, cant really say gotta wait for more info or release to see it in practice untill we can all jump to any conclusions about it.<br />
<br />
What really bothers me is the arcane adept, ok there is so little info about it but somehow that makes arcane really un-attractive.<br />

You already have an unique 5% spell haste raid buff..<br />
You already have a strength and agility raid buff only else given by DKs<br />
You already have a completely unique spell power totem (only improved by demo locks or ele shamans)<br />
Resto shamans have an unique mana regen totem..<br />
Enhancement shamans gives a raid both a 20% melee haste buff and 10% ap buff..<br />
Elemental shamans gives a raid 3% crit + 5% spell crit and a really strong spell power buff (only beaten by end game demo locks)..<br />
<br />
At the moment there are hundreds of reasons to bring a shaman in a raid, especially for 10mans since you cover for so many raid buffs (even excluding bloodlust)... I am really happy that I now have one less reason to bring a shaman for a raid just to make the raid setup competitive.<br />

Resto shamans have an unique mana regen totem..<br />
Enhancement shamans gives a raid both a 20% melee haste buff and 10% ap buff..<br />
Elemental shamans gives a raid 3% crit + 5% spell crit and a really strong spell power buff (only beaten by end game demo locks)..<br />
<br />
At the moment there are hundreds of reasons to bring a shaman in a raid, especially for 10mans since you cover for so many raid buffs (even excluding bloodlust)... I am really happy that I now have one less reason to bring a shaman for a raid just to make the raid setup competitive.<br />
<br />
<br />
And mages bring what..? Arcane intellect and free water... Learn to buy the water, and felhunter (talented) gives the same as arcane intellect... Scorch/winter's chill debuff are given by affliction locks and demo locks...<br />
<br />
<br />
I hope you get the point... And no, I don't play mage, but I have a shaman alt (yes at max lvl) I rarely play on.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
the only 2 things there that arent overritten by another class is mana tide and wrath of air but im pritty sure moonkins do that now so our qq is reasonable<br />
<br />
so basicly theres no reason to bring a dps shammy as they stand<br />
<br />
they need a serious dps boost to be considerd for raids</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Varis</div><div class="date">2010-04-10, 10:41 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We are planning to remove spells that don't have a clear purpose. Amplify Magic, Dampen Magic, Fire Ward, and Frost Ward are being removed from the game, and we may remove more.<br />
The ability to conjure food and water will not become available until higher levels (likely around level 40), as we're making changes to ensure mages generally won’t run out of mana at lower levels. Once mages learn how to conjure food and water, the conjured item will restore both health and mana.<br />
<br />
okay, to get to the point - I think that's just incredibly stupid.<br />
Just because 90% of mages (at least on my server, it seems) don't use them, does not mean they are not useful. Just because they have no idea what to use them for, does NOT mean they have no use at all.<br />
When Saurfang used to be a challange to the healers, I used to buff AM to the raid, because Saurfang ist one of the few fights where all dmg is considered as physical, so people can profit from a little improved healing via AM.<br />
I give Valithria AM to improve the healing done to her.<br />
In PvP, when im doing 2on2 for fun with my boyfriend (warri) I buff DM to ourselves, cause we have no healer and can imrpove our survivability against casters a little bit. if you do a 2on2 with a healer and meet 2 melees (excluding retardins of course) you could aswell buff AM to yourselves to imrpove the healing a little bit.<br />
in koralon fights, when he casts burning breath and I see the healer are having a tough time healing the raid dmg or I'm already low hp to begin with, I use Fire Ward to negate a little bit of the damage. Same for every damn fight in this addon where there is ice raid dmg - and these are quite a lot.<br />
So right now these spells may seem a bit useless, because of the small improvements they provide, but you could aswell give us new ranks for them, and give them utility again!<br />
<br />
<br />
The Burnout talent will allow mages to cast spells using health when they run out of mana.<br />
I'd love to say &quot;Sounds really awesome&quot; if it weren't for this little voice in the back of my head... crying out a word of warning that is &quot;Emo-Mage!&quot;<br />
Personally, I don't like &quot;I turn my HP (into mana) into dmg&quot; - mechanics, without any ability to self heal to make up for it, cause I think its just antisocial (and yeah, I play my lock affliction and not destro or demo)<br />
and last but not least, it makes me wonder (and fear) if fire is going to be the new &quot;shit oom&quot;-specc in raids?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Mana Adept: Arcane will deal damage based how much mana the mage has. For example, Arcane mages will do much more damage at 100% mana than at 50% mana. If they begin to get low on mana, they will likely want to use an ability or mechanic to bring their mana up to increase their damage.<br />
<br />
I wonder how they are gonna make that useful. I mean, in most fights it's more important to have some burst towards the end (like, you have many fights with soft enrage at 30% or something similar, or just the fact that theres is more and more raid dmg towards the end and healers are having a tough time) than at the beginning.<br />
So I wonder how they'll do it - will we have incredible mana regeneration, so that we can make use of that even towards the end of a fight (which makes me wonder if and how we'll have to worry about mana ever again at all *lol*) ? so, I'm really looking forward for more info on the mana reg....<br />
<br />
<br />
okay, that's it with the QQ.<br />
WE GET BLOODLUST!<br />
so, actually, everything else is just plain irrelevant, isn't it? ;D</div></div><hr />

<br />
What should we give mages? How about the strongest cooldown buff in the game?<br />
<br />
Yeah thats a great idea. A PURE damage class really needs the best support buff. <br />
Yeah and lets make it BETTER than the shaman version.<br />
<br />
FFFFFFFFFFUUUUUUUUUUU Blizzard.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Donimator</div><div class="date">2010-04-10, 10:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">LOL......everyone calm down, almost every major raid buff in the game has a superior version for the raid (not the individual), I have a feeling that the haste buff received from Time Warp will be around 10 percent or so less than haste buff received from Bloodlust/Heroisim!! Only thing I worry about is the control of hero in pugs now. I personally have a shaman that I consider an alt, and I can already tell you if I am the raid leader any mage that pops Time Warp without me telling them to do so will promptly be removed from the raid as I do any shaman that pops hero without my say so now. To all the Shamans scared of losing their raid spot come cata. just wait till beta and see what happens :-D!!!!!!!!!<br />
<br />
Edit: Notice they said similar. Which means it isn't exactly the same!!!</div></div><hr />

Shamans DPS is fine, but now you can't get carried through raids because of Bloodlust.<br />
<br />
Too bad.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pennygear</div><div class="date">2010-04-10, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Some of these comments are ridiculous... Seriously, stop fucking whining and deal. Ok, so, mages are getting a heroism. So? Shaman still have it. It's not like they're taking it AWAY from shaman. There are still plenty of reasons to bring a shaman to a raid. Sure, maybe not YOUR shaman, depending on your specs, but holy crap, that's your choice. Melee/caster/healing hybrid is indeed versatile, therefore if a raid is looking for one of the THREE specs a shaman can be, you and your shaman are probably set. <br />
<br />
PS: this game isn't JUST about PvP either... please wait and keep all your goddamn crying under wraps at least until the beta launches. <br />
<br />
Jesus these forums sure bring out the bad moods :\</div></div><hr />

sounds like arcane focus will be useless, since your spells should always hit considering being hit capped is mandatory in pve.<br />
<br />
<br />
It helps with clipping/pushback. So if you clip the last two missiles of Arcane Missiles you get your mana back for those two missiles. You can miss in PvP too, Rogue vanish, talented blink, etc. You will want every ability that gives you mana, because more mana = more damage for Arcane. I really hope that we get more talents and abilities that help us get mana back, because the current mechanics (Mana Gem + Evocation) is not gonna be enougth.</div></div><hr />
