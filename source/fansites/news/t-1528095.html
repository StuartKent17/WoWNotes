Character Viewer Updated: Female Gnome &amp; Male Tauren!<br />
We’ve updated the viewer on our website (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/warlords-of-draenor/#characters) with two of the revised character models you’ll see in Azeroth and beyond with Warlords of Draenor. Meet the new and improved Tauren Male and Gnome Female!<br />
<br />

Garrisons and Questing<br />
It says, if you choose a certain building type, you will get different quests that open up for you, which kind of defeats the purpose of leveling up with your friend if you get very different quests? Will there still be a main quest chain to do, that has little to do with the garrisons, I am concerned if I was leveling and questing with a friend and we wanted different structures, we would have to do completely different quests, before teaming up again.<br />
There are main quest-lines in each zone, yes, and when you pick a building for your Garrison, the quests associated with it are part of the side-quests in that zone. If you and your friend pick different buildings, some of your side-quests will be different while others may overlap. You can still adventure together and help each other out, though. because no matter where you are in Draenor, there will be lots of points-of-interest (treasure, rare spawns, bonus objectives) you both can encounter. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/316383-garrisons/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13001920124?page=1#19))<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Several of these tweets are referring to the recent alpha patchnotes update (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/315561-warlords-of-draenor-alpha-patch-notes-05-23-2014/), so be sure to look at those notes for more context.<br />
Classes<br />
Every other tank has quite serious healing. Oh well, going to have to pin all hopes on Blood Craze.<br />
All tanks will be *much* more healer dependant in Warlords. In Mists, tanks needed way too little external healing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469784242432393216))<br />
<br />
On this note, has there been talk of prorating any proc chance associated with a partial DoT tick? Or too small to worry about?<br />
It's something we'll do on specific periodics/procs if need be, but not worry about in the general case. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469917224057053184))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
In addition, ONLY Multi-strike Auto's giving 15 RP, in addition to losing Rune Regen, won't we see many more empty GCD's?<br />
You'll see some empty GCDs, but not a ton. Remember that you're adding haste to the mix. That's big. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469784410271662080))<br />
<br />
Going over the new Blood changes, Scent of Blood proc'ing from Pestilence? Wouldn't this mean we will see far fewer stacks?<br />
Potentially, but it's tuned around that. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469784585740369921))<br />
<br />
Heart strike being removed? Why?<br />
It was overlapping in role way too much with Blood Boil / Pestilence. Merged them all. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469941203375378432))<br />
<br />
a bit late question, will blood dk's get a new &quot;shield&quot; like the rune strike gave before you removed it?<br />
No, but check out the Enhanced Death Coil perk as its replacement. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469943676840337409))<br />
<br />
so what is the point in removing the shield from rune strike and give us death coil insted? coil is useless!<br />
Death Coil is absolutely not useless; it's better than Rune Strike in every way now, and Blood's new RP spender. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469918821826842625))<br />
on live i have tryede using coil even whit max vengence and rune strike still hits for more, that will be chanced?<br />
Yes. Death Coil is better than Rune Strike was, in every way. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469925764654063616))<br />
<br />
Sorry to really bug, but do you consider your old design of &quot;hard to learn easy to master&quot; balance, applies FDKs aswell?<br />
No, I'd say that high-ilvl FrostDKs are 'easy to learn, easy to master' on live. Primarily because their tuning was such that... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469922592061550593))<br />
...their rotation devolved to spamming 3 buttons at high item level. We're working to ensure that doesn't happen in Warlords. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469922812451250176))<br />
<br />
Why was DK Army of the Dead damage reduced by 75%? Is it now intended to be a cosmetic ability rather than a powerful cooldown?<br />
Not cosmetic, but not a huge damage source. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469947026050785280))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s))<br />
Can you comment on the removal of Pounce? It's rather iconic, thematically. That's what cats do.<br />
Indeed, but it was awkward for Cats to have a stealth action bar for only 2 abilities, and also awkward to have 2 abilities that... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469931126060883968))<br />
...were only usable while stealthed but still taking up bar space, that many people just macro to combine with Shred/Rake anyway. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469931291895275521))<br />
<br />
Why did you guys basically add back in dream of cenarious for ferals, took away one of the interesting talents in the process.<br />
Because Bloody Thrash was actually not very interesting; it was purely passive, and we don't want 2 passives on a row. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469942075480227840))<br />
<br />
The new balance stuff sounds even more confusing than the old. Is it basically a pendulum that's always swinging?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469945052467171328))<br />
Well, always while in combat (and for 30sec after combat). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469945126597296128))<br />
<br />
The balance changes mostly sound good, but a 3 second starfire cast time is royally gonna screw over balance druids in pvp<br />
Check out Enhanced Owlkin Frenzy. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469936855765778432))<br />
why is starsurge a 3 sec cast now? Same as chaos bolt? Will it do comparable dmg?<br />
Starsurge is 1.5sec cast. Starfire is the 3sec cast. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469945961448366080))<br />
<br />
why 3.0 secs castime for starfire?,it doesn't even hit hard!,how will i cast this in pvp? will damage be proportional to it?OMG!<br />
Yes, damage will be proportional. And check out Improved Owlkin Frenzy. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470013586832490498))<br />
thank you! for instance warlocks have chaosbolt which has a very long castime but deals a ton of damage! is something like that?<br />
Chaos Bolt is also resource limited, and not able to be made instant. Not the same. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470017884840673280))<br />
<br />
So hyped for the Boomkin changes! Is the new Astral Showers passive or activated?<br />
Passive. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469942200319475712))<br />
<br />
Seems like new Balance rotation is &quot;snapshotting light&quot;, are you worried about affdots et al neutering skill check?<br />
The Eclipse benefit on Moonfire/Sunfire is the only thing that's snapshot. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469950796243537920))<br />
<br />
is moonfire and sunfire doing equal dmg on each tick? the difference is astral shower?<br />
Correct. (And they benefit from different Eclipses, obviously.) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470308022510555136))<br />
<br />
Any insight on the intended tools for Boomkins movement DPS either in movement heavy fights or PVP ?<br />
Moonfire/Sunfire, Glyphed Astral Communion. Considering Starsurge being instant, but unsure yet. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470308334419992576))<br />
<br />
With the new Celestial Alignment, is that &quot;maximum Eclipse bonus&quot; a 30% boost to everything or a 15% boost?<br />
30% (before Mastery). It acts as if you were at 100 energy in both directions. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469942851183190017))<br />
<br />
oh dear god that is a lot to take in. A LOT. Like. What. That's a 100% spec redesign. Scared. Very scared.<br />
It's a big change, indeed. We look forward to getting your feedback in alpha/beta, and iterating on the fun. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469914853956911104))<br />
Mostly worry about being in wrong eclipse wrong time for AoE vs Single Target. Just gotta get hands on it.<br />
Both sides are good at both jobs, and Astral Communion can be used to line your cycle up with the fight. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469915424369684481))<br />
Hmm. That's good to hear. I worry about Charges &amp; being w/o a proc for Haste boost consistently.<br />
You can bank those charges for a long time, and doing so intelligently is one of the big skill differentiators. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469916066312118272))<br />
Also! Curious on Mana Regen. Currently 50% on Pushing Eclipse. What do I get mana from if no eclipse to push?<br />
We'll likely need to give them some form of mana regen, but that didn't make the notes. Don't worry, mana won't limit DPS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469926460086431744))<br />
Is this tied just to new environment design, or something changed in the backend of leap itself?<br />
Changed; it'll be more reliable everywhere. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469933014458175488))<br />
<br />
How will Balance regen mana with new Eclipse mechanic?<br />
Not sure of the exact mechanic, but the gameplay will remain similar to today: mana is a limit on off-healing, not DPS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470022016074911745))<br />
<br />
Still processing all the Balance druid changes, but why make Starfire's cast time even longer? It's already painful.<br />
To ensure that both sides line up well, and feel very different. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469924543109165056))<br />
<br />
shared charges is genius.<br />
Pretty happy with Starsurge &amp; Starfall sharing charges in order to get Starfall out of the single target rotation(Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469918463180693505))<br />
balance energy only generated in combat or all the time?<br />
Starts toward Lunar when you enter combat. 30sec after you leave combat, the next time it reaches 0, it stops there. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469927238977081344))<br />
<br />
Also lack of instant starsurge further removes the only burst opportunity (which was RNG) that moonkin had.<br />
Reliably firing multiple Starsurges in a row is big. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469937069691658241))<br />
solar/lunar empowerment stack or are we meant to weave the starsurges between wrath/starfire<br />
They do not stack. You'll want to place your Starsurges where you can follow them with 2 Starfires or 3 Wraths... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469944475121250304))<br />
...within the next 15sec. And preferably put those Starfires/Wraths near the top of the cycle peak. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469944930589085696))<br />
<br />
Re new Balance: Does Moonfire and Sunfire snapshot your Eclipse buff and update with all other procs?<br />
Yes. Everything is dynamic *except* for the Eclipse level is snapshot when you cast it. So you want to cast them near the peak Eclipse (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469922336158646272))<br />
just to clarify, sorry if dumb question, this is when the cast is finished/leaves my hands, correct?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469930878311735296))<br />
<br />
will starsurge be instant with sun/moonfire procs still? Or is starsurge instant on its own now?<br />
No, Starsurge is a 1.5sec cast time, but not instant. Charges means you can delay using it (such as due to movement) without loss. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469920685301587968))<br />
and what's the thought on the new lunar shower interacting differently with moonfire/sunfire?<br />
Want to make the different sides feel and play differently. Pros/Cons to both. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469928427978379264))<br />
fair enough. Rewording my other question, does new mushroom just emit damage+slow while active? Or does it just emit the slow<br />
Just the slow. Starfall+Hurrican for Balance AoE. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469936170189590528))<br />
<br />
What happened to Nature's Grace? And do Shooting Star procs still make Starsurge instant? Like the changes so far!<br />
We'll tune Moonkin damage to be great without Nature's Grace. No, Shooting Stars doesn't make it instant, but cast time is 1.5sec. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469930299212587009))<br />
I don't understand...Nature's Grace removed or dmg loss smaller after Nature's Grace runs out? I<br />
Nature's Grace is removed, yes. We're tuning Moonk damage to be great without it. Intended that Stellar Flare doesn't trigger SS. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469936643009687552))<br />
<br />
BTW can we get a cosmetic glyph of astral storm for the pretty astral storm effect?<br />
Currently planning a glyph that swaps Starfall to Sunfall, and Hurricane to Astral Storm. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469952256918294528))<br />
<br />
Only way to make the new Balance DoTs work is to remove the eclipse snapshotting too. This way we're not rushed at the 30% mark.<br />
It's a sine wave, which means it's much slower at the ends than in the middle. Easy to get 95%+ of optimal. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470009743319117825))<br />
What happens if Im in full Lunar, and it comes time to AoE which might actually happen since I no longer have control of eclipse<br />
Then you use Starfall, which is now great for AoE. Additionally, Astral Communion is great for aligning Eclipse to the fight. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470012815588077568))<br />
<br />
And dont give Astral Communion as a solution. That's bunk. Sit there, do nothing for 7 seconds so I can AOE properly.<br />
Starfall is quite good, and your description of Astral Communion is quite wrong, anyway; it'd be 3sec, not 7. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470013347144806400))<br />
So it would only take 3 seconds to go from one end of the eclipse bar to the other?<br />
You move at 4x speed while channeling. In 3sec, you'd move the bar 12sec, which is where you want to be to Hurricane. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470014246994984960))<br />
(That centers the Hurricane on the peak, with decent haste) (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470014431783432193))<br />
I guess Im thinking of this as more of a pendulum where at the end of each swing is the strongest. Is that not the case?<br />
Yes, that's correct. But AoEing takes time. If you go all the way to the end of the swing, you start on the downslope. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470015961886498816))<br />
<br />
What's with the Genesis notes? Looks like the same function as live. Ps ToL was taken in progression for mana. No ooc=weaktalent<br />
More consistent with our changes to periodics. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469935424803057665))<br />
<br />
I have to ask, will the new Druid DoC talent copy all rejuv healing onto yourself or only 1? THe former seems overly strong.<br />
It literally casts a Rejuv on yourself. Casting multiple Rejuvs is just extending the one on yourself. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/470023154320945153))<br />

Is what made losing the 10% haste from SoI so easy to bare. I was excited to actually change seals based off the situation! -c<br />
Prot did not lose 10% haste. They never had 10% haste. Seal of Insight was spell haste only. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/469917472867368960))<br />
<br />
any reasoning behind the reverting seal changes for paladins? Does this mean we are keeping the current seals model?<br />

Warcraft Movie Updates<br />
Filming for the movie finally finished (https://twitter.com/ManMadeMoon/status/469811946531721217) up last week. While filming may be complete, there is still a lot of post production work to be done, so the movie won't be released until March 11, 2016.<br />
<br />
IGN is reporting (http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/30/ben-foster-reveals-his-character-in-the-warcraft-movie) that Ben Foster (http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004936/) will be playing Medivh (http://wowpedia.org/Medivh) in the movie!

a lot of these you wouldnt spec into. you come into the raid as a dps, you're expected to do as much of that as possible. I don't think he understands what we mean for raid utility IE something we don't have to lose a dps talent for to help the group like all other classes do.</div></div><hr />

Could certainly be either; it's the Star Wars effects studio working on it. Though, I'm <br />
leaning toward lots of it, well done. <br />

The actor praised visual effects house ILM and the work they've already done <br />
on Warcraft. &quot;The way that they're pushing motion-capture -- I just saw some of the <br />
test footage -- it's unlike anything I've ever seen. It's performance-capture. It pushes <br />
it to the next level. It's going to be one helluva 3D event.&quot;<br />

<br />
I've been confused about this, too. They had polygonal eyebrows that change color with the hair in the Blizzcon images, but since they've been viewable in wowhead's model viewer, they've had flat textures representing their eyebrows. Maybe they've got two versions of the eyebrows going and they still haven't decided which one they're going to go with. The polygonal eyebrows let them match the hair color easier, but textural eyebrows allow them to change the eyebrow shape easier. Ideally, they'd come up with a solution that allows them to adjust the color and the shape.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you're going to have to back up your statement with something more than a general phrase. <br />
<br />
You and ALL of us, have no idea how the WoD system works. All the classes have to be experimented and tweaked to no end. Blizz have the most informed clue about what direction ret should go in. Judging the changes to a class for WoD by current standards is like comparing dumping a shark in the desert and judging it's entire species hunting ability<br />
<br />
Ret has to be changed to fit in with the WoD system and shifts. The only questions here concerning ret is the seal reshift (seriously now, this is what testing and alpha/beta is about, you &quot;test&quot; things to see how they work and then see the results, the ACTUAL numbers, not heresay) and the raid utility question, which was a ridiculous question for exactly the reason the dev answer indicates and because almost all classes are losing their raid utility equivalent of Dev Aura.<br />
<br />
If anything the first question reveals how clueless the players are.</div></div><hr />

People who still loves WoW and so happens to still love it in 2016? and two years is not really a long time. Besides WoD will be out by then which will probably have renewed the spark in some currently inactive players.</div></div><hr />

Short filming and long post-production is hopefully a good sign. CGI &gt; Makeup with this kind of content. At least when it's done properly...</div></div><hr />

<br />
but i wonder if they are going to make him a main character in the guise of a gandalf and the plot might revolve around him as the story teller or the &quot;wise person&quot; so to speak.<br />
<br />
going to be interesting, 2016 seems so far away but, i suppose it won't eventually :P</div></div><hr />

you must not have watch alot of movies :), because while he rarely plays main characters, he is not a a no name. He was pretty good in Lone Survivor, if you like to watch people having a very bad day lol.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They started filming late January (27th, if I recall correctly.)<br />
<br />
So far, the only part of this movie that was done &quot;fast&quot; was the casting, and that's <br />
mostly because a lot of the actors were already in talks before casting 'officially' began. <br />
<br />
Furthermore, little effort and time? They have been rejecting scripts and swapping <br />
crewsince 2007 because they weren't as good as Blizzard wanted them to be. This <br />
isn't anotherquick cash-grab video game movie; and they've said they don't want <br />
to even make a &quot;video game movie&quot; they want to make an epic movie that just so <br />
happens to be based on a video game- just like so many movies are based on comic <br />
books and novels.<br />
<br />
<br />
So for us, it's [like], We don't know how to make a movie out of Warcraft, <br />
the video game. [Instead], it's the incredible story, and the war, and these races, <br />
and everything these guys at Blizzard [Entertainment] have come up with. They <br />
have 100 books, and just this incredibly rich world that they've created.<br />
<br />
And so having Duncan Jones realize that for us was exciting. We've also taken our <br />
time, because we absolutely don't want to screw it up. And I think we're getting <br />
close to a place [where] we're ready to go. And when the script is finished, and <br />
when we feel like, 'Forget whether or not there's a built-in audience. Does this <br />
stand on its own, and is it great?'</div></div><hr />

It wasn't a short filming schedule. Started in January, lasted about 5 months. Most big budget movies take only about 3 months to film.<br />
<br />
The Lord of the Rings fims had shorter shooting schedules.</div></div><hr />

Don't know what part they cast him in, but Clancy Brown should play Terenas Menethil in the movie.</div></div><hr />

That's because Tauren are so awesome they don't need help to be cool.<br />
<br />
I honestly try to see what the heck people saw of so bad in the new Tauren Model, but I can only see awesomeness.<br />
Oh well, perhaps this is only bad taste and I'm overthinking their opinion.<br />

P.S.: Laylriana, thanks for ruining female gnomes for me.</div></div><hr />

I concur. I really hope that they use Tridyna's (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12505892331?page=1#1) modifications (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/12505892331?page=1#9) for the female gnome's face. <br />
<br />
Tauren are in a fairly good spot.<br />

<br />
Agreed. They don't look good at all, no matter how excited their modelling staff is. Having a female gnome (unsubbed for about 2 years now), this does not entice me in the slightest to come back - in fact, it makes me want to stay away more.</div></div><hr />

<br />
you dont know anything about movies do you? the filming is probably the shortest time spent in the entire process... the editing with all the effects, motion capturing and animations (fireballs?) will take a year for a movie that lasts less than 3 hours, especially a fantasy movie.<br />
<br />
The entire project for the Lotr trilogy took 8 years. All 3 movies were filmed simultaneously, editing followed shortly after filming concluded.<br />
So they probably started in 1994 and finished before 2001, 2002 and 2003 releases.</div></div><hr />

Umm no wasn't started in 1994... But you are right all three were shot at the same time, but that took place in 1999-2000 (438 days)</div></div><hr />
