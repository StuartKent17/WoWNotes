Warlords of Draenor Developer Interviews<br />
PvP Live had the opportunity to interview Holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka) and Kim Phan (https://twitter.com/kimaphan) this weekend during their PvP Tournament (http://pvp-live.com/content/armageddon-interview-brian-holinka-and-kim-phan). <br />

<br />
eSports<br />
<br />
Blizzard is always looking to make WoW a better esport.<br />
Right now the team mostly focuses on 3v3 arenas, but they want to hear what the community wants in regards to eSports, in PvP or otherwise. <br />
Arenas are a big part of what makes WoW an eSport, but there may be other parts of WoW that players would also be interested in. For example, some players enjoy the Live Raid at Blizzcon.<br />
Other partners have reached out to Blizzard to see what tools they are putting in place to support eSports, including MLG (https://twitter.com/MrAdamAp/status/444196493956632576).<br />
PvP can be hard to watch, especially with TDM being much faster in other games. In WoW, it can take 15 minutes for someone to die or something exciting to happen, which is a long time for someone watching that isn't very familiar with the game. This can be partially mitigated by casters keeping viewers informed with what is going on and why.<br />
The game has to be fun to play before it can be fun to watch. The next step is having tools that make it easier to watch, such as spectator mode.<br />
The devs are looking at the smaller things they can do to grow the WoW eSports community.<br />
<br />
<br />
Spectator Mode<br />
<br />
Being able to set the time before Dampening activates in Spectator Mode games isn't planned right now, as having inconsistent rules would make arenas harder to watch.<br />
The addition of spectator mode (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/3774-Warlords-of-Draenor-Trial-of-the-Gladiator-Gone-Skirmishes-and-Spectator-Mode) for Warlords of Draenor arenas being one example of something the community has been requesting for a long time that is finally being added.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP in Warlords of Draenor<br />
<br />
If the team makes a balance change, players get upset about the changes that were made. If they don't make any balance changes, people complain that the game is starting to feel stale. <br />
The team has been trying to increase the participation in PvP, without hurting the game that people already doing PvP love. <br />
The way that CC and DR works is hidden to many players, but it is also one of the important parts of competitive PvP. The team would like to make them less complex, as complexity is good when it adds depth, but not good when complexity exists for no reason. <br />
The PvP game is going to feel very new and different in Warlords of Draenor, almost starting from scratch with balance. This time around the team will spend a lot of time on iterating on things and collecting feedback from top players that give useful feedback. <br />
<br />
<br />
Holinka<br />
<br />
Holinka does rated battlegrounds and arenas most days of the week, as well as some arenas at lunch almost every day. <br />
He also plays other games as time permits, such as Titanfall and Stick of Truth. There are lessons to be learned from playing other games.<br />
He had 6 characters and 8 specs that he played last season, so he understands the effort it takes to cap on alts. <br />

quick question. why cant i use death's advande when using the glyphed version of pillar of frost...?<br />
20 seconds of CC immunity with no downside is too good. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/440978198050770944))<br />
<br />
Need way to dump RP to AE. Feels like this has always been missing. Most common request for 5.0 and now 6.0.<br />
Sindragosa's Breath. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441650526782885888))<br />
Indeed, but cd means it cannot be used to dump RP, and talent means not universal. Many DKs will cont to FrostStrike/DCoil in AE<br />
That's fine. The whole row helps with AoE. Doesn't have to be an RP spender. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441651165042716672))<br />
<br />
I mean, to a pt that a talent can chng your gameplay ? Bcause with what we can read now, i don't think so and it makes me sad <br />
Yeah, some of the lvl100 talents are pretty significant changes. Necrotic Plague for Unholy = the Festerblight rotation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441531538916638721))<br />
Sindragosa's Breath also changes your rotation quite significantly, primarily for the DPS DKs. Makes you want to pool... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441531729547771905))<br />
...RP as it's coming off cooldown, and generate/dump RM as much as you can while it's up, to keep it going as long as poss. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441532041041936384))<br />
I feel like it would have to proc rune talents for that to be effective<br />
It does. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441539756506492928))<br />
is conversion going to proc them also?<br />
We're thinking about that one still. Possibly. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441722989285892096))<br />

yall nerfing gaurdian druids in PvP or nahh?<br />
You are the first person to ever complain to me about Guardian Druids in PvP (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/441306991244214273))<br />
really? Theyre incredible good flagcarriers<br />
There's nothing wrong with a class being good at something. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/441328985457192960))<br />
<br />
The balance druid eclipse mechanic is very clunky, can we do something with it in WoD. Like remove it?<br />
Eclipse is the defining mechanic of Moonkin. Virtually zero chance that we'd remove it. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/441373003998179328))<br />
<br />
Can you tell us if Equinox for balance druids has changed? It sounded too powerful to be true, or Eclipse is lower to fit it in.<br />
Equinox is still in, yep. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442169798344982528))<br />
<br />
Will there be an glyph for old efflorescence though? The on-demand placeable AoE heal far more valuable in WoD healing model!<br />
Not planning to. Moving your Shroom is still on-demand placeable AoE healing. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442241514194735104))<br />

arcane IS very boring to play and it DOES suffer from movement the MOST. arcane mobility v warlocks\hunters not fair.<br />
Arcane is intentionally very movement inhibited. That's one of its downsides. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/440448091267678209))<br />

Has it been a couple weeks yet? Let's Take A Jab At It has dropped! More WW, MW soon(tm). with http://t.co/D84wRW8Bo1<br />
I think you guys are imagining some huge &quot;us vs the developers&quot; thing that we don't even see as there. There seems to be this misconception that we are saying &quot;You guys are doing it all wrong, and could be doing WAY more damage!&quot; or something. Saying that we are telling you avoid haste like the plague is just strawmanning. I think this all started when there was some really silly bad theorycraft going around in like 5.1 or 5.2 that said to take Ascension, max max MAX haste, and don't use FoF or EB at all. That was quite wrong, and we pointed out, then words have been put in our mouth since then. Result is, haste/crit/mastery are all really close, and we've seen top performance with each, as long as you don't energy cap, and make good use of FoF/EB.Future of FoF: If +30% dmg will make you satisfied... you'll be elated. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442221616013918208))<br />
.Do you think the lack of lots of other high secondary stats stems from lack of wanting to try them? Or follow the leader?<br />
Following the leader is an incredibly strong effect in our community. Not sure what you're referring to exactly here though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442241063739072512))<br />
<br />
Why is orb spam being removed not mentioned. Its the only burst heal instant monk got not tied to big cds<br />
...except for Surging Mist, right? Remember that retuning is happening. Surging is lackluster in 5.4, won't be in 6.0. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/442255202440056832))<br />
<br />
Are fistweavers and windwalkers (or melee in general?) supposed to attract desecrated weapon on garrosh?<br />
It's distance-based, not spec-based. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/442807274528964608))<br />

<br />
Anyways, i think the novel should shed some light on a light side of garrosh we didnt knew. We all know he was willing to do anything for the 'real' horde. Perhaps he is similar to Arthas in a sense since he would do anything for his people ( purging Strat, lifting up the blade )..</div></div><hr />

If there aren't enough people at far enough range (3 people in 10m), the desecrate is completely random and can land in melee.</div></div><hr />

I laughed too. <br />
<br />
Crowd controls in PvP is a joke because of druid, lock and mage with a powerful CC on a GCD. That's probably the most retarded thing in PvP. Other classes have CC on a 30/45+ seconds CD and it feels right. Because you have to think if it is worth it to use the trinket or not.<br />
<br />
PvE is over for me as I am not gonna do the same raid for a year, I hate PvP in WoW so I guess I'll see you guys in WoD or not depending of WildStar quality.</div></div><hr />

I dont agree with this statement at all,i think you should ask people of all skill because even the worst of arena players can give valuable feedback to the arena system,its basically like asking all the rich people in your country what they should do about the poor,your going to get a one sided answer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The problem with asking a lot of lower skill based people is they tend to blame everything on class imbalance or random causes. Sure, some higher level players are like that too, but I think a lot of players suffering from the Dunning Kruger Effect and rarely look at themselves at the reason for not being very good.<br />
<br />
To find real class imbalance, just look at 2000+ (or 2200+) brackets is a much easier way than asking someone below 1500 why they think they aren't doing very well.<br />
<br />
EDIT: For examples, look at Arms Warriors who complain about being underpowered despite having the highest representation of any spec in S15 (by a fair margin, over double the next closest spec which is crazy), Rogues who complain about not being viable since WoTLK, Druids complaining about not having enough survivability, etc.</div></div><hr />

Right, but it's pointless to try and approach PvP with just the viewpoint of glad-tier players when the majority of people who do PvP aren't that level of player. Something can be very finely balanced for 3v3 and then be entirely broken in say, random BGs where there is less coordination, focusing and lower level gear. It's true that people can often misunderstand the source of their problems in PvP, but that doesn't mean it's a good idea to ignore the voice of 95% of the PvPers in the game and make balance choices based on a very small bracket.</div></div><hr />

WoW PvP is and will stay a joke. Blizzard needs to separate PvE and PvP abilities, fix the CC on GCD and fix the insane healing that some non-healing class are able to do.<br />

When people hope to have the OP class in PvP at the start of each season, you know there is something completely wrong with the current state of PvP.</div></div><hr />

This game does not really take years to learn. Leveling does very little to help you learn your class at 90. Either you are derp and cannot learn or you are not.

Holinka has a lot of time on his hands to play wow that much. Maybe he should actually work for once. :P Spectator mode will be awesome. :D<br />
<br />
Not to mention. Some really good games have been really, really screwed up by listening to one player or even multiple players when making design decisions. Whatever this persons favorite class and PVP spec is has a very good chance of being extremely OPed, and whatever he enjoys doing is probably going to get the most attention. Forget about the other millions of people that PVP.<br />

Lol you didn't like the DLC.. I have found this one and many of the others hilarious, loved how they poked fun at the new 90 boost..<br />
<br />
It was good, but it just gets old hearing people (normally the people doing the absolute worst performance) complaining about instant 90s in LFR before they rage quit. People acting like people weren't capable of suck before instant 90 is just a joke!<br />

They've made PvP unpleasant for people who don't do arena or rated BGs.<br />
<br />
Which really means they made this game even more guild reliant. The vast majority of good activities in this game are guild reliant. What happens when you do not want to be in a guild because you really do not want to be bossed around by some 21 year old kid stroking his epeen? If Blizzard really wanted to focus on this game they would leave guilds as social places for the majority of players and raiding for the dedicated hardcore few. Then every single activity would be capable of random matching. Not having random matching for activities (Heroic Scenarios, Challenge Modes, Rated BGs, Arenas) is what really messes up the social aspect of this game to begin with. Not being able to group with people you do not know to get things accomplished really changes this game into a very clique aspect and that aspect drives new players out of the game when they do not meet the &quot;right&quot; people.<br />

Except... that is not the question they are asking. What they are asking is why do you not want to PVP? Why can't you get in on this little eSport that we waste development time on that could be better used elsewhere. They completely understand that the majority of the players are not going to PVP and a small vocal minority whines enough to get Arenas. Arenas were NEVER a good idea, and Arenas are STILL not a good idea. That has been proven time and time again but Blizzard fails to listen to the various people that have pointed that out. Hopefully, they will destroy Arenas so incredibly badly that they will find a new way to make the game an eSport... It looks like that is where they are already going. Make no doubt about it, the only reason we still even have Arenas is because Blizzard wants sponsorship money when they run eSports. I would rather see a Coca-Cola machine in Orgrimmar personally!</div></div><hr />

I don't think I've heard a statement best sum up PVP in MoP this easily in a long time. The whole &quot;PVP power&quot; thing has just served to make the gear divide between the haves and the have-nots even worse. The crafted gear is a complete joke at this point and the honor gear is barely worth the trouble. You either faceroll in 2v2 until you have enough Conquest to get your gear so you can actually have fun in BGs, or you continue to be cannon fodder for the rest. At least in BC you had half a chance of beating someone in full current-season gear with last tier's stuff. Let's not even get into the difference stuff like heroic warforged weapons make.<br />
<br />
Edit: Also get rid of the stupid restriction on having to earn X amount of points to buy a weapon. People wanna grind honor to get a 522 starter weapon for PVE? let them. People want to grind Conquest and get their weapon first? Let them. There is no reason whatsoever to force people to do something they don't want to do for long periods of time and in the process screw up other people's fun.</div></div><hr />

PvP needs work, but listening to biased commentary has not helped. Horde still win most bgs, because the community cries that they're more &quot;skilled&quot; and we get changes to AV that don't address the actual Alliance favor that the Horde has whined about.

Yeah, there is a good reason. The lazy will flock to BGs for the free 522 wep and skip the RNG of raidfinder completely... Getting their weap way faster than the PVE route. No matter what path you pick, time investment needs to be similar or it nullifies choice. Blizz has made it very clear that this is the intent and reason.</div></div><hr />

What are you people talking about? Who's thinking grinding out bgs for 100 honor a loss, or 250+ a win towards 7250 is the &quot;fast way?&quot; LFR is 15-45 minutes and you maybe have two bosses each tier with weapons you can use. How badly has your RNG been?<br />

Can't agree more. Arenas don't make sense for a rpg. WoW is about playing a role, a class towards some kind of gear progression, and 2-5 players of the 11 classes/34 specs does NOT allow for the spread they created. They shot themselves in the foot with arena, because it forced them to homogenize so that more specs could be competitive on a smaller scale. A scale that makes no sense considering everything.</div></div><hr />

I don't think you get it. Pvp weapons are not obtained faster than LFR weapons. Easy? As long as you understand calling a grind easy is just addressing the fact that its not RNG related, then yes, its easy. Worst case scenario, I may have ran a boss 5 times before the weapon dropped. Less time investment, but no guarantee it will be so for everyone else. Also, can we all agree that running bgs for pve content, or raiding for arena/rated bgs needs to stop being viable?</div></div><hr />

So, you're guaranteed to get that LFR weapon drop in six days? Please tell me more!<br />

Oh my god time investment. Do you understand what time is? The elapsing of seconds, minutes, hours. Yes, LFR is faster. You are chain farming bgs for 13 hours to get a weapon as opposed to maybe 3 hours stretched between different play sessions. Get an alt, do battlepets, go outside ffs.

Remember, you may have to burn all your charms on up to four separate runs to maximize the chance a weapon drops. If the weapons you want are in loot tables with many entries, the chance you get a drop can be quite low, even if you burn charms.</div></div><hr />

Haha. Your ability to condescend on the topic is funny. You'd rather run content for a minimum of 13 hours straight to get a lower ilvl weapon, instead of getting one in the content its suited for, while also having multiple chances to upgrade all your other equipment slots?

My preferences have nothing to do with what we were discussing. We were discussing whether it is faster to get the PvP weapon or the PvE weapon. The calendar time required to get the PvP weapon is much shorter than the expected time to get the PvE weapon, since it's not gated by a weekly lockout and RNG.<br />
<br />
I'll argue the aggravation to get the PvP weapon is also lower, if one goes the daily quest route.</div></div><hr />

The point is, we are arguing about an opinion, while you were trying to prove your point by defacing me. Try not to be a mmo-champion stereotype, buddy.</div></div><hr />

No, we are arguing about objective mathematical facts. You are simply in error on this matter. There is no &quot;opinion&quot; involved.</div></div><hr />
