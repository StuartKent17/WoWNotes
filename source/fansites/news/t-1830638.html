Nerdtacular - Blizzard Panel<br />
Chris Metzen, Russell Brower, Randy Jordan, and Patrick Beja (Blizzard EU PR) joined The Instance to talk about Blizzard and WoW. There isn't really any new information or news, but it is still a good listen for Blizzard fans.<br />

Be sure to pick up WHEE! (http://www.wowdb.com/spells/46668-whee) from the Darkmoon Carousel or the buff from Darkmoon Top Hat (http://www.wowdb.com/items/93730-darkmoon-top-hat) before doing dungeons during this bonus weekend or your Tanaan Daily quests for extra reputation!

Galissa Sundew (http://ptr.wowdb.com/npcs/55103-galissa-sundew) sells many new items for Darkmoon Daggermaw (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124669-darkmoon-daggermaw), which is fished from the waters in the zone.<br />
You can fish up 100 x Darkmoon Daggermaw (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/124669-darkmoon-daggermaw) for Silas' Secret Stash (http://ptr.wowdb.com/quests/38934-silas-secret-stash), which rewards Silas' Secret Stash (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items/127148-silas-secret-stash).

There's something to be said for healthy skepticism. It helps you maintain a firm grounding in what your expectations are for something. It also leaves room for you to be pleasantly (hopefully) surprised. We'll do what we can to continue to share information, insights, relay feedback, and be here for you to share your thoughts with. That isn't changing. <br />
<br />
As to Bashiok leaving, I know many will try to interject meaning into it, but sometimes, change is just change and nothing more.<br />
<br />
You probably won't respond but are blues even privy to the info of the next expansion?<br />
We are indeed. We just can't talk about it yet. All things in their time, my friend. All things in their time. I liken it to knowing what a friend has gotten another friend as a gift. Until the friend with the gift is ready to share the gift with the other friend, it's not my place to spill the beans. Otherwise, you ruin the joy of the gift giver. It's a simple analogy, but it holds up just the same. The developers work very hard to put together the content and systems that go into the game. It's my job to make sure that I share what they want me to share when they are ready for me to share it. No sooner than then. <br />
<br />
Personally I can't believe anything any developer says about the next expansion. I can only wait to see what it will actually end up becoming after it's released.<br />
That's OK to feel that way – perfectly valid and we'll be watching to see what you think.<br />
<br />
Just one request, Neth, with regard to &quot;relay feedback.&quot; Can you guys get a checklist or something to ensure that what gets relayed as feedback is accurate?<br />
Feedback comes from multiple directions: what people say on the forums, what they say on fansites or in the media, what they say in game, and importantly what they DO in game. It all gets watched and reported on via multiple channels, we watch, customer service watches, the developers watch, etc. There are multiple reports that go out as well. One of which we ourselves do every week from every region (from the community management end). Plus, there are constant discussions via email and in person. So, no one &quot;checklist&quot; would ever convey the plethora of information and feedback that flows like a giant tidal pool –there are undercurrents of undercurrents that occur. We do what we can though to keep on top of it all. Keep in mind too, sometimes the answer is, &quot;we agree&quot; and sometimes it's &quot;we disagree&quot; due to design goals and whether agreeing fits or doesn't fit into that. In the end, we are also passionate and human about what it is we do.<br />
<br />
Please inform Zahrym that I like the way the patch notes are presented in a somewhat verbose manner.<br />
This is actually Rygarius that puts these together and has for awhile now. I'll let him and the developers (who have a hand in them) know you like them.

PvP<br />
any update on Shaman Ashran book? Still bugged: speed drops to 130% and invisibility mostly doesn't work<br />
Bug tracking for this is in our system. We don't have an ETA as of yet for when it'll be fixed. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/624380985455546369))<br />
<br />
again, agree. This particular racial seems to me to be superfluous outside of PvP and causes more problems IMO<br />
Agree with both. Average player tends to play a race they like visually (see blood elves) but (1/2) (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/624733461081776128))<br />
casual players often look for answers from the high end on what's &quot;right.&quot; They have some effect. (2/2) (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/624733905732501504))<br />
After listening, I could probably talk about it for an hour. Twitter is a bad place to discuss but... (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/624799368810397696))<br />
Disagree that racial is sole reason faction imbalance occurs. It's significant, but other factors at play too. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/624799541406007296))<br />

World<br />
Xhul'horac's Black Hole seems to violently toss players away if they are at or very near the spawn point once it spawns. Bug?<br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
While the developers have been pretty quiet since @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/with_replies) appeared, Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
PvP<br />
you can tell riot employees play and care but blizzard doesn't pvp. Do you think that's why WoW pvp is so bad?<br />
When I was there, a lot of people did PvP. I assume they still do. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/617463315854290944))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
You weren't a lore dev, but you followed the story enough. What's been your favorite storyline?<br />
Wrathgate maybe? I liked that Arthas didn't just come kick ass. Played against expectations. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619545684199391232))<br />
<br />
You've said that you liked night elves when they were fierce. Could you explain what changed your mind? Was it the Alliance?<br />
Feel like we shifted them to more traditional fantasy elves than the fresh take on them in War 3. Not sure it was conscious. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619545121579597825))<br />
define traditional. At least compared with high/blood elves. Darnassus a factor or focusing more on priests vs. sentinels?<br />
I just felt like we allowed WoW NEs to be too much like LOTR or D&amp;D elves. The War3 NEs felt pretty different and new IMO. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619550421137227776))<br />
<br />
what about the lore behind battlegrounds and capturing objectives in world pvp? Vanilla and BC for examples.<br />
I think BGs get the closest, especially AV, but of course your victories really don't change the world so they can feel hollow. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619550578880876544))<br />
<br />
you've said that you're a fan of wow's faction conflict. What do you think about those who believe it only exists for pvp?<br />
I found PvP frequently expresses it the least. One shotting a gnome in Arena doesn't feel like the Second War yanno? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619544518325506049))<br />
do you feel that there can be a balance between 2nd war style conflict and WC3 fighting a larger evil? Should one be focused?<br />
It's really hard in an MMO to have one faction &quot;win&quot; even for a short time. Would be cool though. MMOs often go to a 3rd threat. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619550201678671873))<br />
I'd love to develop an MMO where the world actually changes, dramatically and regularly. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619550755217764352))<br />
<br />
UI / Addons<br />
Am I the only one thinking WoW's UI is a disgrace, with addons a cumbersome, player-unfriendly crutch ? What Would Apple Do ?<br />
Just different schools of thought. People like to customize their UI. Even Apple lets you change a little, like the wallpaper. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/618070055805300737))<br />
<br />
Game Design<br />
I read something pretty insightful on the wow forums. It is possible: http://t.co/d9p26uZq3k<br />
There are also a lot of devs on WoW who have been there forever. That claim of no institutional memory rings hollow to me. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/618992627094978560))<br />
institutional memory? Can you elaborate on what you mean by that? You didn't start on wow from the start but for a length<br />
You learn early in this business to be able to kill your babies. It's game design 101. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/618992418726133760))<br />
The claim was that new devs hadn't learned anything from experienced devs. No&quot; institutional memory&quot; or &quot;tribal knowledge.&quot; (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619143208400846852))<br />
If you take a franchise to a brand new team, they may not know what mistakes to avoid or even what feels satisfying. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619143633388703744))<br />
As one example, an artist might have to practice making models for months before they really get the style. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/619143776792002560))<br />
<br />
Misc<br />
Hey GC, did you get a freebie pass to Riot or did you put in an application like us regular chums? Just curious. Thanks!<br />
I didn't have to submit an application through the website but I had many interviews. It was so not a free pass. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/616717493327953922))<br />
<br />
Assuming you don't spend the remainder of your career at Riot, are there any genres of games you haven't but want to work on?<br />
I want to do a tactical RPG with excellent combat. (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/618142905585172480))<br />

I wouldn't say their balancing is bad. But it could be better. For example, when updating champions, their priority seems really weird. Instead of taking the least played, most outdated champions with terrible abilities and mechanics, they sometimes just update good/mediocre ones, like Ryze</div></div><hr />

Judging from your name, avatar and reading countless of your posts - You're nothing but a troll.<br />
<br />
You can fault anyone for anything but thats just you being too negative. Shamans are not that bad at all, enhancement are quite strong and the elemental in my guild still tops them on most fights iirc.<br />
I would not call it broken at all. Improvements could be made but that can also be said about any class and not just shamans.<br />
<br />
You just sound too butt hurt to take seriously.</div></div><hr />

You know the DPS Shamen in my guild whine about this a lot and yet they're still producing the results (and Enhancement is consistently destroying everyone in AOE) so you can take your &quot;I'm underpowered, pity me&quot; rant and stick it where the sun doesn't shine.</div></div><hr />

<br />
There's some truth to that - one of the things I loved/hated in classic is classes were allowed to be what they were - rogues were overpowered in PvP, Warriors unkillable, cloth wearers vulnerable - but they got fun things like drains and fear to defend themselves. They revamp the classes from the ground up too often - I can play a vanilla rogue today, and be comfortable with the rotations, but Warlocks? Priests? Druids, especially balance? It's a constant moving target. The game needs some stability.<br />
<br />
Plus, it's time to decouple PvP from PvE. It's just time. You can't create a &quot;one size fits all&quot; class. Let PvP design go nuts and be fun and have cool, fun toys to kill other players with, let PvE focus on leveling and group content. Let classes shine and have defining abilities and skills, that aren't hampered by &quot;Well, x class doesn't have a counter to that&quot;. PvP is so bursty now, and it's overlapped onto PvE play - it's one thing to get a Horde player down fast in AB, but does that really feel right questing in The Spires? Or classes that have ramp up nukes for raiding...what does that do for them in questing, when they pull 3 mobs, or the fight is over before they can ramp up, or they're dead in AV before they can ramp up? <br />
<br />
I suspect rather strongly that class balance and decoupling pvp/pve is one of those hotly contested ideas in the dev ranks, and it will be this way until the game shuts down, which is kind of sad. It's a constantly moving vision, and added to that, they often don't bother/forget to tell US what the vision is.</div></div><hr />

<br />
:rolleyes:<br />
<br />
I watched the 1st 30 minutes of that video...3 things were pretty apparent...<br />
<br />
1) Blizzard has become very hierarchical and bureaucratic, as can be expected of any company that has grown to the degree Blizzard has, and is as a result a much different company than the company that brought us WoW 10 years ago and much has been lost in translation as a result (essentially admitted by Metzen in his comments)<br />
<br />
2) Blizzard has a multitude of games that it produces now and those games are clearly taking equal or greater resources from the &quot;expanded&quot; team than are being spent on WoW<br />
<br />
3) Metzen is so burnt out after 22 years that he can't even coherently spout the time worn, and no longer true, BS about not releasing half-baked, un-engaging content anymore...he sounds like a broken record for much of the first 30 minutes<br />
<br />
and that is all you really need to know about the current status of WoW</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think people who complain about the company for the lackluster Expansion won't feel facefucked in any way if a good one would come out. I think it would be more in the line of &quot;finally our pressure and backlash shook them up&quot;. I'm kinda one of those people. <br />
<br />
I don't attest Blizzard any malice, but they are very resourceful with prime grade brands and according pricing. They also talk and present themselves that way. They must expect people having high demands. Hopefully the WoD problems were merely caused by difficulties during change-management (training of the new Team).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
And this kind of phrasing is exactly why it sucks to be a CM or try to reply to 'feedback' on the forums in general. Everyone is simply out to push their own agenda and will desperately frame their questions to be full of hostile insinuations. They think they're cleverly forcing Blizzard to concede the prior point by answering the subsequent question but all it does is invite needless backtracking to correct misinformation. It's like many feminists talking about video games, they don't care about the final product at all, merely the moment of discussion in transient where they get to stand on a soapbox and push their ideals. <br />

I wouldn't say it so drastic, but yes, the questions are ridiculous. I wish for some relevant questions, not so stupid questions as on blizzcon 2014.<br />
<br />
Why were so many features cut in WoD?<br />
Why did ashran fail as hard and what you wish to do better (destructibles, siege craft; simply more like wintergrasp)<br />
Why do you swing always as extreme content-wise (MoP Dailypalooza, WoD Grind-o-palooza); would a mix of both be better.<br />
Will there be a real capital in the next expansion (FINALLY???)<br />
Will the future xpack be so content-short like WoD or more like MoP?<br />
Did the work on the new models took to much time away from actual content in WoD? Or was it maybe the Garrisons that took to much developing-time?<br />
Any chance for some serverwide unlockable content like Isle of Thunder or Quel'Danas?<br />
Flying; will it be available through an archievement in the future as well; or only when the actual content is outdated?<br />
Why no no-fly-zones like in BC, where you could get shot down when you fly over an enemy base; or something like the fel cannons in Ogri'la?<br />
<br />
I hope for at least a few useful questions, not some stupid questions like if you can create ingame-bacon *sigh* or one of thousands transmog-questions.</div></div><hr />

By his own statements, his design philosophy was no longer meshing quite so well with Blizzard - at least not the way that it does with Riot - so once again, why do you care about an opinion that is becoming more and more irrelevant regarding the future of this game? Why not list every other Warcraft player's opinion at this point?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Blizzard wasn't involved with making that. Scott is friends with the voice actor, Liam O'Brien. He's recorded stuff for the show as Illidan before because Illidan is the biggest Warcraft character he's done. Liam might know more than the general public if Blizzard has had him record anything recently, but it's probably not a hint.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think everybody is secretly hoping that Blizzard's next expansion is awesome.<br />
<br />
It's just that the company has trained many of us not to expect it. Personally, I used to think of &quot;Blizzard&quot; and immediately think &quot;AAA brand, buy without hesitation&quot;. Now I think of &quot;Blizzard&quot; and think &quot;they phone it in to get your cash, then hype/mislead/lie in order to string you along for as long as possible&quot;. <br />
<br />
I'm not sure where how that mentality changed. I know I was very disappointed in Cataclysm. I thought D3's loot model and RMAH were a scam. I didn't really care for SC2's story and the deployment of their &quot;expansions&quot; felt a little bit cheap. WoD was/is a silly, time-gated, content-gutted, phoned-in pile of poop. <br />
<br />
Ultimately, people get angry because they care, not because they don't care. If they used to trust something, and that trust was taken-for-granted, that leads to resentment.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tzalix</div><div class="date">2015-08-03, 09:42 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I watched the 1st 30 minutes of that video...3 things were pretty apparent...<br />
<br />
1) Blizzard has become very hierarchical and bureaucratic, as can be expected of any company that has grown to the degree Blizzard has, and is as a result a much different company than the company that brought us WoW 10 years ago and much has been lost in translation as a result (essentially admitted by Metzen in his comments)<br />
<br />
2) Blizzard has a multitude of games that it produces now and those games are clearly taking equal or greater resources from the &quot;expanded&quot; team than are being spent on WoW<br />
<br />
3) Metzen is so burnt out after 22 years that he can't even coherently spout the time worn, and no longer true, BS about not releasing half-baked, un-engaging content anymore...he sounds like a broken record for much of the first 30 minutes<br />
<br />
and that is all you really need to know about the current status of WoW<br />
<br />
Good example of how having preconceived notions about something changes what you hear, because I heard none of the things you claim.<br />
<br />
Also, for the people complaining about the &quot;quality of the questions&quot;, it's fucking nerdtacular. It's done purely for fun and there's nothing official about it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
well, you must have missed the part where Metzen talked about being the 15th employee, the frat party atmosphere and ease of collaboration in the early days as opposed to how now everyone has an office and the various different departments and its harder to communicate as a result...I am summarizing but he definitely said essentially that in the first 30 minutes<br />
<br />
and lets not forget when he was just rambling on about quality and totally lost his train of thought and kept repeating the engaging/polished content mantra<br />
<br />
my other point about the number of games and resources needed for them wasn't directly attributable to Metzen more, admittedly, speculation as it only goes to figure that with them producing many more products these days there have to be resource trade-offs.<br />
<br />
But, if you missed the 1st 2 points you should watch the video again</div></div><hr />

Doubt it. Watched it live and multiple times since.<br />
<br />

He most definitely did not say that. Maybe you need to watch the video again. He did talk about how the sudden success of WoW lead to a couple of extremely intense years as they grew much faster than they had anticipated. He talked about how it changed from a frat party to a real business, but never said it's harder to communicate because of it. They had to relearn, in order to figure out how to run this thing, but it wasn't a bad thing.<br />
<br />
<br />

<br />
And it couldn't be that he was just tired from the travel or anything, as he works for Blizzard and is therefore clearly not human.<br />
<br />

They said it would be a matter of weeks and it's been months. Either they're hugely incompetent or they're purposely slowing this shit down to try and squeeze out more sub money. Either answer is disgusting.<br />
<br />
You're a real peach, you know that?<br />
<br />
It's been six weeks, dude. That is literally NOT months. Who's staying subscribed so they can wait for flying? If you have the achievement now and aren't having fun with the game, cancel your shit until you get a release date. If you are still doing things and don't want to quit, shut up already and quit being a big crybaby for the next three weeks. <br />
<br />
After that? Sure, come back and complain about broken &quot;promises&quot;</div></div><hr />
