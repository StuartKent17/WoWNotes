Apparently, a few people are interested in that &quot;Cataclysm&quot; thing and I guess it's time for an update of what's going on.<br />
<br />
The Alpha is protected by a Non-disclosure agreement (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-disclosure_agreement), which basically means that anything I could post could get me sued. I'm not saying it will happen, Blizzard has been fairly forgiving with everything posted on the site in this past but I think you will understand that I cannot just post everything I find without checking a few things first. <br />
<br />
For the moment, Alpha related posts on the forums aren't moderated (it would be stupid to think we can moderate all the posts about it) but people trying to scam or spread false rumors will be rewarded with a 3 months ban from the forums. Anyone linking or advertising emulation/cheating sites will be permanently banned from the forums. <br />
<br />
And because you're all going to ask anyway, yes, the Deathwing model posted everywhere on the forums is real. <br />

When I saw the Cataclysm introduction website for the first time I was shocked by seeing the<br />
background with Deathwing on a hill, completely destroying everything. He looks 3 times as big<br />
as the current model, maybe even bigger, and I really hope we get to fight something bigger than this! :D</div></div><hr />

Don't think so. It's far too good to be just a placeholder. I for one love it. I mean, it's a frigging dragon. It's gonna look like a dragon no matter how you design it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
They used ALOT of placeholders on the WotLK Beta.</div></div><hr />

Indeed.<br />
<br />
Which means that - as always - everything is subject to change. So don't build up too high hopes about anything being final, until it actually is.<br />

Deathwing returned to his lair beneath a mountain. His proximity to the Demon Soul was ripping his body apart, so the goblins forged an armor of adamantium to serve as a vessel to contain Deathwing's raging powers and keep them in check.[5] Only the adamantium plates kept the power from destroying his body.<br />

I think you mean animations. Applying one texture map intended for one model on to another one (unless, obviously they were almost duplicates) just end up as a mess. Whether it's the final thing is anyone's guess but it certainly looks legit.</div></div><hr />

It's still on the Alpha phase, so it'll take some time to even get to closed beta (if they don't go straight to open beta). Just keep your eyes on the sites and communities like this and I'm sure you'll be among the first who know.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Near the end of the war Deathwing became so powerful and malevolent that he was splitting between scales. The power from the artifact he created (the Dragon/Demon Soul) was beginning to unravel him. To stop the damage he was doing to himself he had his goblin engineer reinforce his body with some type of metal that would cover the seams in his scales (and lay ontop scales). It also would make him more formidable and difficult to hurt.<br />
<br />
That's the lore explication for the chin and the metal bands you can see all along his arms and legs that cover the seams in his scales. On his underside he should be all metal.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure that'll be the final model for Deathwing also, after all when sandbox models for Arthas and his Death Knight version were leaked during the WotLK Alpha people were sure that the &quot;pie-eating prince&quot; model would be changed, instead it was taken straight to the final build.</div></div><hr />

You're right in everything else except in the fact that Boubouille has indeed agreed to not disclose anything since he's part of Friends &amp; Family Alpha (which obviously requires you to &quot;sign&quot; NDA).</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
He may. Remember that he is significantly larger than Alexstrasza (who along with her mates has her own unique model in Wrath). I suspect he will get a unique model update as well.<br />
<br />
The picture shown has him much smaller (even smaller than Malygos, who is the least of the Aspects in term of size) than he should be.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So. Your whole business model is based on grabbing information as early as possible for the up and coming wow changes. Some of these changes are mined out of files, or picked up from leaks, etc., against Blizzard's wishes.<br />
<br />
Let me get this straight... you signed a non-disclosure agreement? Did you READ it? I'll take a wild guess here and say that the agreement (like all other non-disclosure/non-compete, etc agreements) is a massive blanket statement. I'll go as far as to guess that the agreement legally restricts you from sharing any information related to Cataclysm (or any other Blizzard product) pre-release.<br />
<br />
I hope you have a good lawyer, or a different business model.</div></div><hr />

So. Your whole business model is based on grabbing information as early as possible for the up and coming wow changes. Some of these changes are mined out of files, or picked up from leaks, etc., against Blizzard's wishes.<br />
<br />
Let me get this straight... you signed a non-disclosure agreement? Did you READ it? I'll take a wild guess here and say that the agreement (like all other non-disclosure/non-compete, etc agreements) is a massive blanket statement. I'll go as far as to guess that the agreement legally restricts you from sharing any information related to Cataclysm (or any other Blizzard product) pre-release.<br />
<br />
I hope you have a good lawyer, or a different business model.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll go as far as to say that you know little to nothing what you are talking about. And unless you are a member of press that comes in contact with Blizzard, I doubt you would know. So... what was the point of your post exactly?</div></div><hr />

Sites that release information that itself is protected by the NDA can face lawsuits. If I remember correctly the sites releasing the alpha info on Wrath got some nasty emails/letters/lawyer phone calls</div></div><hr />

maybe you have to sign one to use the key? thought about that?<br />
<br />
maybe just like the terms of use that you need to click on Accept to log in, that also counts as legal <br />
<br />
tbh i think giving boub an alpha key was a good thing for blizz to do to make him not post anything. if he had not key, he could have found someone who has one, make them leak it anonymously and post that, but now if he posts anything in the front page he is legally vulnerable.</div></div><hr />

It's probably more like the current TOS. Every time you scroll down the wall of text and click &quot;accept&quot; you're agreeing to their terms and can get your account banned for doing something wrong.<br />
<br />
Likewise, i'm sure everybody in the FaF Alpha has similarly &quot;agreed&quot; to the NDA.</div></div><hr />

Garfield isn't owned by Universal Press Syndicate, it's owned by Jim Davis' company Paws. As we've seen with the popular &quot;Garfield minus Garfield&quot; website, he doesn't mind people changing his comics around. Only Disney is that anal about their copyrights (telling a daycare to remove a mural of their characters or get sued, only to have Warner Brothers come in and paint a mural of Bugs Bunny and company for free). When money is involved, THEN Jim Davis and Paws would get angry.</div></div><hr />

RE: The subject of getting sued by Jim Davis--the photoshops that Boub's been doing are considered parody. Isn't that covered by Fair Use?<br />

RE: NDA and the purpose of Mmo-champ--I'm pretty sure Blizzard is well aware of the existence of this site, and many other fansites, out there. I'd venture a guess to say they check it daily at the very least.

I know back then when someone wanted to be an &quot;offical fansite&quot; you had to keep leaks kinda low or they throw you out, but given that you are not listed (http://www.worldofwarcraft.com/community/fansites.html), I don't think you care. The other thing is, the material shown kind of has blizzards copyright on it. IIRC, they could &quot;sue&quot; you for publishing their stuff w/o asking, even if you didn't sign something.<br />
<br />
On the other hand this could be a HUGE templar conspiracy pushing the cataclysm hype ::).</div></div><hr />

MMO-Champion is changing. MMO-Champion would have stayed the same if it never agreed to a DNA and kept on posting the news that made it famous.<br />
<br />
Without agreeing to a DNA, it would have been tough to sue them. They would have been sued many times before otherwise.<br />
<br />

<br />
I think we are getting slightly off the rails here...<br />
<br />
The entire point of gaming is to have fun, right? So why on earth are we pointing fingers and calling each other names when that, simply put, defies the whole meaning of having fun. I understand that there will always be people provoking hatred everywhere we go, but lets leave them to their own bitter world, and focus on the thing we all share. Love for games.</div></div><hr />

Boub has always been a leader in the wow community in finding out the latest and greatest additions to wow, even before blizzard wants it known.<br />
<br />
It is obvious now that Boub has sold out this community for a F&amp;F key. We wont see any new information until Blizzard tells him it is alright to post it. Boub might as well have this website re-direct to www.worldofwarcraft.com.<br />

Boubouille would be the first one to post leaks. The reason he isnt now is cause he got an alpha key which is the exact reason why he got an alpha key.

This. A lot of people seem to be assuming that Boub hasn't already been heavily weighing out what he will and won't post on this site. I talked about this back on page 11, briefly.<br />

Also, I don't know about everybody else, but I come to MMO-Champ for a lot more than spoilers. I come here for addon reviews, for the lulz, for a consolidation of blueposts/discussions, etc. <br />

Boub has always been a leader in the wow community in finding out the latest and greatest additions to wow, even before blizzard wants it known.<br />
<br />
It is obvious now that Boub has sold out this community for a F&amp;F key. We wont see any new information until Blizzard tells him it is alright to post it. Boub might as well have this website re-direct to www.worldofwarcraft.com.<br />
<br />
Boub must be proud that all he had to do to get the key is stab us in the back. Congrats Boub, hope it was worth it.<br />

I start to see a pattern in these type of posts in &quot;HOW DARE YOO BOUB TO STAB US IN THE BACK THE SAME WAY YOU DID WITH REPORTING WRATH ALPHA STUFF, HOW DARE YOOO! YOO HAVE CHANGED!&quot; manner. Of course, they have way less clue that this was the same way before other expansions as well. Tsk, troll harder.</div></div><hr />

If by opinion you mean utter bullshit that has little ground to reality, yes, that falls in quite nicely with the definition of trolling. That, or those opinions are stupid. Happens quite often.</div></div><hr />

He did his best to do so. Had he gotten the inside information back then that he got when he posted about Cataclysm before Blizzcon, he would have.<br />
<br />
Ruining the surprise at Blizzcon 2009 was more of a headache for Blizzard than crap like this Deathwing model that MMO-Champion is erasing off their website right now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
He posted that he knows of the leaks, but said that he respects the NDA, so he will not post anything of them. Instead, he focused on the regularly scheduled stuff like blue posts and the like.</div></div><hr />

[who has the law on their side, I'm sure.]<br />
<br />
If you don't like the way Boub shows information, then you're probably more than willing to find another site to go to. Hell, there was a site during the Wrath alpha dedicated to leaks. [which was taken down until the beta, oddly enough.] So if you don't like how Boub is going to do this, then don't give the site your presence. Page views = public opinion.</div></div><hr />

You do know he only stabs whiners/QQers in the back? 'Cuz of the NDA, he's not allowed to post Alpha stuff, but I bet we get to see loads of Beta stuff!</div></div><hr />

A lot of people seem to be assuming that Boub hasn't already been heavily weighing out what he will and won't post on this site. I talked about this back on page 11, briefly.<br />
<br />
Also, I don't know about everybody else, but I come to MMO-Champ for a lot more than spoilers. I come here for addon reviews, for the lulz, for a consolidation of blueposts/discussions, etc. <br />
<br />
If you feel that strongly about knowing stuff way ahead of time, learn to datamine it yourself. Eesh.<br />
<br />
<br />
Exactly! I come to MMO Champ for a lot more than spoilers granted, I have been refreshing frequently because I do enjoy spoilers for me it makes me more psyched about a game. I do also enjoy the site for the blue posts, the good discussions, his addon reviews, the laughs and everything else that makes MMO-Champion. Boub is awesome and I hope he never stops what he is doing.</div></div><hr />

I think your advice sucks, and you must do too because there is no point in giving advice to someone when you fail to follow it in the first place.<br />

Of course you would think his advice sucks because your a troll. Why would a troll agree to not being fed. I am sure if a bear had the ability to talk would tell you not feeding them would be a bad idea...</div></div><hr />

Im not talking about now im talking about back then and as a poster has already said he did inform us about wrath leaks. So i ask you, If he had no problem doing it then why does he have a problem doing it now? <br />

My point is that you recognize me as a troll and so does he. His advice being you should never feed a troll, it's a clear case of him feeding a troll by telling him never to feed a troll.<br />
<br />
I never even aknowledged the term of troll or trolling. I'm just going by what he says and his logic is as horrid as your failed intervention on his behalf.</div></div><hr />

Do you think you've become an artist at what you call trolling? Would you say you're the Picasso of the troll community on this website? Your post count seems to suggest it would have come with practice, not natural talent.<br />
<br />
Enlighten us, oh, great one :P<br />

I think you're ridiculous, by the way. You should just treat everyone the same and actually make an effort to respectfully disagree with them instead of just using what kids would: easy excuses to dismiss what they are saying.</div></div><hr />

I'm serious I can imagine the couple of users who are saying that Boub sold out and how mmo-champion is supposedly no better than wow frothing at the mouth.<br />
<br />
It's not that big a deal people!<br />
For reasons already stated we might not be getting much update regarding the alpha. Am I dissapointed? Yes? Am I gonna act like it's the end of the friggin world? No.<br />
I enjoy WoW greatly and I do keep my eyes out for new info but if there's gonna be a delay in the new info, no problem, I can afford to wait a while, there are other things that I can do in the meantime, more important things too might I add.<br />
<br />
Boub sell out? More like some people overreacting to the extreme and needs to lay off WoW for a while.</div></div><hr />
