Balancing DPS Specs<br />
It's very hard to come up with compelling niches for where a warlock would think &quot;I really want to be Demo in this situation.&quot; But I'd argue the same thing exists between Affliction and Destro. Earlier in LK Affliction &quot;won.&quot; Now things have shifted back to Destro.<br />
<br />
Again, this is not a lock specific problem. For awhile Arcane felt like a better spec for high-movement fights, of which there were many. Now depending on who you talk to, Arcane just flat out &quot;loses&quot; to Fire. The suggestions players tend to make involve the constant tweaking of spell damage, coefficients or talents up or down until everything is within 1% (or whatever) again. I just don't know how realistic that is or if there's a better way to do it.<br />
<br />
[...] That may be sufficient for you. That may be sufficient for a lot of players. But I don't think it would be sufficient overall. The question to ask yourself is at what point would you abandon the highest dps spec for your favorite dps spec? 10%? 5%? 1%? For a lot of players, they just want to know what the highest potential dps spec is and care less about the magnitude of the differential. You can just say those players are dumb and we shouldn't cater to them, but I can tell you a lot of players feel that way.

Arcane Shot and Beast Mastery<br />
Yeah that was my point. The solutions are:<br />
<br />
1) Give BM a signature shot and try to give Arcane a situational use.<br />
2) Buff Arcane so deep in BM that nobody else will get that talent.<br />
3) Accept that BM needs to be buffed in ways other than shots.<br />
<br />
There are good points and bad points to each tree having a signature shot. A bad point is that it makes e.g. set bonuses hard because you can't boost things like Explosive Shot easily. A good point is the trees feel a little more different rather than just swapping Explosive Shot for Raccoon Shot if you were BM. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18680002539-hunter-qa-what-a-let-down.html))<br />
<br />
Arcane Shot and Beast Mastery (#2)<br />
What I read: &quot;I am so eager to try and put down the devs that I don't like to think about what they said.&quot; This has been brought up in like 4 threads since the Q&amp;A went live. If your main goal is to find ammo for how the devs don't understand your class, at least read the other threads first.<br />
<br />
If we buff the holy heck out of Arcane, then every Survival hunter just shoots Arcane and won't take Explosive Shot. Since a lot of the Survival tree is designed to prop up Explosive Shot, we think this would a bad thing. Hence, we have to be very careful about how much we buff Arcane. If we do it in a very deep BM talent, then it's probably safe. If we do it baseline or through a glyph or an upper talent, then we might get into problems. By contrast, buffing Explosive or Chimera is pretty safe because no other hunter can ever use those shots. BM doesn't have a &quot;this is BM only&quot; attack to buff, unless it applies to the pet.<br />
<br />
There is a similar discussion going on for DKs about at what point they can stop using Scourge Strike and just use Obliterate instead. That would be bad, because an Obliterate-based Unholy build is a lot less fun or distinct to play. A similar thing happened the last time we tried to buff Devastate. Fury warriors said &quot;Yummy,&quot; and gave up a big chunk of the Fury tree in order to get it. <br />
<br />
[...] As I have said a couple of times now, a very deep BM talent to buff Arcane Shot might work. Otherwise, most of the BM damage is tied up in the pet or at least the pet being alive. Perhaps BM could benefit from a totally new mechanic, even it wasn't a signature shot, so that we would have more knobs to turn when we needed to buff BM (and only BM). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18570234960-hunter-qa-thoughts.html))<br />
<br />
T7 4 piece Bonus<br />
That was the point I was making. The original hunter bonus was &quot;Your Explosive Shot, Chimera Shot and X Shot do more damage.&quot; The lack of an X shot (it couldn't be Arcane or Steady) killed the whole feature. We designed the DK expressly to have an X strike for every build. We could do that with hunters too. Some players are saying that just makes the specs more and more like each other though.<br />
<br />
At a high level, you can have a trivial choice among your specs, which means it doesn't really matter which you pick so the decision is not terribly interesting. Or you can have significant differences among the specs, but that means one-size-fits-all balance solutions and even set bonuses are much harder. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18680002539-hunter-qa-what-a-let-down.html))<br />
<br />
PvP against Melee<br />
I am saying circle strafing is not our vision for WoW PvP. It is supposed to be about using your abilities at the right time. We don’t want to solve a balance problem by turning our PvP into a game where nobody ever stands still. I will turn this around, and say that your solutions need to account for a melee class being able to kill you even if you're a really clever hunter. Any of these solutions that approach &quot;and that way melee won't ever be able to catch me&quot; sound great if you're a hunter and not so great if you're a game designer. We don't want melee to clobber you every encounter. But we don't want you to kite them while shooting at them either. At least in the first example you are doing some damage to them. In the second, they don't even get a hit off. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18570234960-hunter-qa-thoughts.html))<br />
<br />
Pet Avoidance<br />
As we suggested in the QA, we are more likely to just remove Avoidance as a talent and make pets largely immune to mob AE damage. We did however add more talents to the pet trees specifically because many BM hunters said that they couldn’t get anything really useful with their extra talent points. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18570234960-hunter-qa-thoughts.html))<br />

Buffing Demonology<br />
I'm not saying we won't buff Demonology. I'm saying buffing Demonology to where it feels like a valid option to Destruction and Affliction puts it in a very narrow window. Buffing Demonology to a point where it is still 10% behind Destruction might not convince many players to change specs (except for those who just love Demo). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18696991923-warlock-qa-followup.html))<br />
<br />
[...] We're not crazy about going back to the &quot;this is the PvP tree&quot; design.<br />
<br />
But it is hard, and you can argue impossible, to make sure 3 dps trees all perform very similar to each other in a wide variety of encounters such that they feel like real choices. It is easier for say shamans or druids because the alternatives are so different that players aren't as likely to shift en masse from one to another. It depends a lot on what &quot;very similar&quot; means. For some players, they'll play a favorite spec that does 10% less damage than the optimal spec. For others, they only want to know &quot;Who da best?&quot; and could care less if the difference is only 1% (and therefore likely swamped by their own player skill).<br />
<br />
Please, don't interpret this as an announcement that we're giving up. It's just an acknowledgement that distinct but equal is pretty challenging, and can even shift immediately once players hit a certain threshold of gear.

<br />
I still have meta as my second specc. In a raid environment it is 500 less personal dps, but demonic pact on the other hand provides 500-700 more dps to every single dps caster. However not many are willing to take one for the raid.</div></div><hr />

Something like Mirror Images but for the pet. Or you can call a second pet from your stables for just a short time. Or you can summon like &quot;ghosts&quot; of any pet. Or something like a &quot;Tag&quot;-ability, marking your target and causing the pet's next attack to do much more damage, like laser-marking a target for missile-guidance, can be like 1-2sec channeled ability.<br />
<br />
There are many many ways to improve the BM and give him smth unique, and obviously, Blizz is much better at inventing such things than me, so let's wait - until then I am quite satisfied with my Chimera Shots :D</div></div><hr />

<br />
It already is, in some ways. As an example, Fire Mages are dead for PvP and Frost Mages are dead for PvE. They're not making massive revisions to change either since Mages still have their respective PvE and PvP specs.</div></div><hr />

Exactly my point. He isn't willing to see the truth, Ghostcrawler that is. That we're already in a situation where certain specs of certain classes already are completely dead for either PvE or PvP. Which is not so bad really. I don't see the problem with Demonology becoming THE Warlock PvP spec. At least it would give it some attention from the players.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
At this point, he (probably) isn't going to say &quot;We're going to go back to the old system&quot;. If anything, he's previously said &quot;We know Frost Mages (or whatever other spec) are dead for PvE, but we don't have a good plan for buffing them yet, so we'll leave it alone for now since you still have alternatives&quot;<br />
<br />
This stance allows them to keep classes where the more-than-one-viable-spec tactic works, such as Paladins (to varying degrees of success), while allowing them to excuse themselves for cases where making more than one viable spec is too much or too complicated work.</div></div><hr />

He actually did say it. ;)<br />
<br />
Which isn't necessarily the best decision they could've made. Then again, I haven't been much of a fan of Blizzard's decisions as of late. So, no surprises there really. No hair off of my back really though, as I quit playing a while back. Let them ruin all classes in the process of balancing the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What I meant to say is that they're already practicing this for some classes (Mage, maybe Warriors, etc.), while telling us that they're not to excuse the fact that some other classes have more than one viable spec.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Pyrostemplar</div><div class="date">2009-07-24, 10:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">All in all, what he says is that despite some classes are in the old system o &quot;one tree for PVP, other(s) for PVE&quot; (mages, ...), they are not going into that philosophy and probably are trying to get more choices for the classes with &quot;specialized&quot; trees. Which is not urgent as long as there is at least one preforming tree for each game mode for each class. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, the lofty goals of balancing specs and classes accrosss a wide variety of encounters while keeping some uniqueness have been quite hard to achieve.</div></div><hr />

Balancing DPS Specs<br />
It's very hard to come up with compelling niches for where a warlock would think &quot;I really want to be Demo in this situation.&quot; But I'd argue the same thing exists between Affliction and Destro. Earlier in LK Affliction &quot;won.&quot; Now things have shifted back to Destro.<br />
<br />
Again, this is not a lock specific problem. For awhile Arcane felt like a better spec for high-movement fights, of which there were many. Now depending on who you talk to, Arcane just flat out &quot;loses&quot; to Fire. The suggestions players tend to make involve the constant tweaking of spell damage, coefficients or talents up or down until everything is within 1% (or whatever) again. I just don't know how realistic that is or if there's a better way to do it.<br />
<br />
[...] That may be sufficient for you. That may be sufficient for a lot of players. But I don't think it would be sufficient overall. The question to ask yourself is at what point would you abandon the highest dps spec for your favorite dps spec? 10%? 5%? 1%? For a lot of players, they just want to know what the highest potential dps spec is and care less about the magnitude of the differential. You can just say those players are dumb and we shouldn't cater to them, but I can tell you a lot of players feel that way.

<br />
Isn't this good? Wouldn't it be better if all the viable raid dps specs for classes like this (aka. ones that aren't already down the shitter but just need help, the Mage example used, certain lock specs, or certain hunter trees needing a little boost in some specific department) were closer together so people COULD pick their favorite spec and still be doing at least well? I don't get it, he says he isn't happy with a suggestion to buff or nerf coefficients until they're within 1-2% of each other, but he cares about how much people are willing to sacrifice DPS-wise to play the spec they like best.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mushin</div><div class="date">2009-07-24, 01:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well I was thinking, since they say there would be so huuuge biiiiiig problems with ammo bags and things connected with that, why they can't implement a drop from end-raid bosses that would work the same as Ultrasafe Bullet Machine (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44507) or the arrow version of this with unlimited amount of ammo inside... nothing big would change in game, the bags and everything would stay the same... That can't be that hard to implement eh or is there something else behind that?<br />
<br />
Just my two cents<br />
<br />
As I interpret it their issue is not so that it's ZOMG HARD to implement a new ammo mechanic - they already have a bow that completely ignores ammo - but that they want some way of removing all the existing ammo bags/ammo from players because it would be obsolete. I really think that's more of a &quot;why can't we do this?&quot; question than a &quot;how do we do this?&quot; though - all that's different between this and the rogue reagent changes is that hunters use a bag. <br />
With the removal of the haste on bags there's no reason to -use- a pouch except to carry tonnes of ammo. All they really need to do is implement non-consumable ammo, change all the existing ammo into grey vendor items, and then let market forces take place. They don't need to move/delete all the ammo bags in player inventories - once they make the change players will do it for them. I expect they're giving this answer out to buy time for them to actually figure out where they're going to put this new ammo - the BC faction grinds were generally just an additional burden for raiding hunters, and the other obvious option is to put them as boss drops; something which clearly isn't working for relics.</div></div><hr />

<br />
IMO since it is our pet and it loves us very much there should be somthing implemented like, when we get CC'd (Stun, Feared, Incapacitated, ect..) the pet goes into a frenzy generating X amount of health over X amount of time OR reducing damage done to the pet by X amount and increasing focus regeneration by X% OR something of that sort of thing, this can be given to BM hunters only but that still leave MM and SV hunters pets pretty much getting squashed in the duration of most CC's. <br />
Another thing we could do is kind of in the same category to what I mentioned above but we can have the pets have different effects depending on what type (talent tree) it is.</div></div><hr />

What is happening to certain classes in the game is that they're only truly playable in just 1 specific spec. Which is a situation that has no business being in an MMORPG such as WoW. Especially in an expansion such as WOTLK, of which the whole design stance of Blizzard was to make it less about the class and more about the actual player.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I don't know about Stampede. But if you remember the Beastmaster in Warcraft was a melee heavy hero. They could kill two birds with one stone if they made BM talent tree buff both pet dmg and melee dmg. It could be the one tree that would actually put those stat sticks to work!</div></div><hr />

Shot, but it was an added piece of green loot that was guaranteed drop, and even though it was hunter only, it did not matter since it did not affect the rest of the loot table, there is no reason that boss 3,5 or 7 in a raid instance could not have the new non-consumable ammo(or X Amount of Crates) drop from it as a given, in a similar fashion. Later on make with the next major content patch make that ammo purchasable with badges or from the previous tier, just like they did with Sigils.<br />
<br />
In terms of buffing BM- it was nice to see at least one piece of loot in Hyjal that was BM specific, I understand the desire to not make class specific/spec specific loot- yet at the same time other classes have not only 3 sets of tier gear designed for them, but also a variety of other items as well (no one other than a holy paladin is using Plate Healing gear are they?)<br />
<br />
Redesign set bonuses and or bring back 6-8 piece sets..allowing the ability to have different set bonuses at the same time.<br />
I believe that Hunter T8 has one of the lowest Proc rates out there... since we do not have 3 separate sets.. 4 piece for mages, warlocks,hunters and rogues could have a bonus that affects each tree<br />
<br />
Incorporate a passive BM ability , or redesign spirit bond so that it is similar to the T5-2 piece bonus - Pet is healed for x% of the damage you deal<br />
<br />
BM reactive ability that when pet crits or you use Kill Command- Arcane shots damage is boosted by x</div></div><hr />

That's the problem, right there. The average min/maxer isn't content to just be the best they can--they prefer to sneer down their nose at anybody who doesn't min/max to the degree that they do.<br />
<br />
People know that raid leaders, recruiting guilds, and even just server loudmouths will be watching the damage meters like a hawk. DPS is competitive in that sense. The problem is becoming more that players will be so concerned with their DPS that they'll miss out on key moments in fights, make stupid errors (omg I'm pew pewing oops Mimiron missile killed me quick druidrez!) etc.<br />
<br />
So for once, I sympathize with Blizz. Anybody who has ever been a Dungeon Master can tell you what it's like to try and cater to both people who want to have fun with the game and the people who aren't having fun unless they're squeezing and exploiting every number of said game.<br />

No one is a crybaby or saying they &quot;think&quot; they know all the answers, they are simply responding to Ghostcrawler's pathetic excuse why buffing arcane shot or giving a signature shot to the BM tree aren't the answers.

As Glowyrm said, but yeah - there's also a lot of people for whom pushing the class to the limit is fun. It's those math nerds that have continually pushed Blizzard to keep updating and working on the classes since WoW was nothing more than &quot;lf rogue DM&quot;, and it's fun for them. To boot, I guarantee that you reference their work in some way during your fun as well because over the years that theoretical work has become an incredibly fundamental part of Warcraft.</div></div><hr />

I dont think its possible right now to not get explosive shot, or chimaera shot and still compete. BM 51 point i still think is a little bit on the boring side the pets are nice but for pve SV and MM still outshine in terms of napkin math...some people can probably pull it off.<br />
-- I like the idea of rolling arcane and tranq shot back into each other, i havent played long enough to know but i hear that is how it used to be.<br />
-- Why couldn't BM have its own special shot or &quot;tool&quot; if you will to pump it up. I don't see any reason why you couldnt have a &quot;spirit arrow&quot; or some kind of nature/animal-esque crazy named shot, or poison tipped arrows or fire arrows, idk but i figure your only limited by cynics and your imagination in a game like this.<br />
-- I also may be limited in my knowledge of pet mechanics but I wish I had a few more abilities for my pet and the ability to make a rotation for my pet, something that i could manage simultaneously with my shots...HOW? idk sounds to complicated for me to reasonably make it work short of growing another set of arms. <br />

I still have meta as my second specc. In a raid environment it is 500 less personal dps, but demonic pact on the other hand provides 500-700 more dps to every single dps caster. However not many are willing to take one for the raid.<br />

Well I don't know what your experience is, but personally I'd say that you lose more than 500 dps by going demo, and also, there has been a bug with Demonic Pact not proccing. There have been posts on Elitist Jerks and other sites about that. Personally I gave up Meta spec due to getting 25% DP uptimes on some fights according to Wow Web Stats (in theory it should be about 90%).</div></div><hr />
