<meta name="description" content="Engineering in Cataclysm - Enchants, Scopes, and Gems 
The Engineering page released on NDA lift day lacked content because spells aren't flagged as &quot;Engineering&quot; yet, however it looks like a lot of stuff is already here and there is enough content to give you a small preview of Engineering in Cataclysm.  
 
The items with the biggest omg-epic factor are obviously the helms that I already posted 2 weeks ago.

The Engineering page released on NDA lift day lacked content because spells aren't flagged as &quot;Engineering&quot; yet, however it looks like a lot of stuff is already here and there is enough content to give you a small preview of Engineering in Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
The items with the biggest omg-epic factor are obviously the helms that I already posted 2 weeks ago. <br />
<br />
Reinforced Bio-Optic Killshades (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81714/reinforced-bio-optic-killshades/) - Plate - Melee.DPS<br />

<br />
<br />
New engineering-only enchants are available:<br />
<br />
Gnome-Matic Phase Fingers (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82175/gnome-matic-phase-fingers/) - Permanently attaches gnome-matic phase finger technology to a pair of gloves, allowing a skilled engineer to increase their haste rating by 340 for 12 sec. The gloves can only be activated every minute.<br />
Quickflip Deflection Plates (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82177/quickflip-deflection-plates/) - Permanently attaches quickflip deflection plates onto gloves, allowing you to increase your armor by 1500 for 12 sec. Gloves can only be activated once every minute. Attaching the armor webbing causes the gloves to become soulbound. An Engineering skill of 500 is required to keep the webbing active.<br />
Tazik Shocker (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82180/tazik-shocker/) - Permanently attaches a tazik shocker to your gloves, allowing a skilled engineer to deal 1654 to 2020 Nature damage to an enemy at long range. The shocker can only be used once every 45 sec. Can only be used on the engineer's gloves, and doing so will cause them to become soulbound.<br />
Spinal Healing Injector (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82200/spinal-healing-injector/) - Permanently attaches a specialized injector kit to your belt, allowing you to inject a Mythical Healing Potion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/57191/mythical-healing-potion/) directly into your bloodstream for increased effect. Only a skilled engineer can activate the modified belt. Can only be attached to your own belt, and doing so causes the belt to become soulbound.<br />
Z50 Mana Gulper (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/82201/z50-mana-gulper/) - Permanently attaches a specialized injector kit to your belt, allowing you to power-drink a Mythical Mana Potion (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/57192/mythical-mana-potion/) for increased effect. Only a skilled engineer can activate the modified belt. Can only be attached to your own belt, and doing so causes the belt to become soulbound.<br />
<br />
<br />
Scopes are also here: <br />
<br />
Gnomish X-Ray Scope (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81932/gnomish-x-ray-scope/) - Attaches a permanent scope to a bow or gun that increases its ranged critical strike rating by 88. Attaching this scope to a ranged weapon causes it to become soulbound.<br />
R19 Threatfinder (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81933/r19-threatfinder/) - Attaches a permanent scope to a bow or gun that increases its ranged hit rating by 88. Attaching this scope to a ranged weapon causes it to become soulbound.<br />
Safety Catch Removal (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81934/safety-catch-removal-kit/) - Removes the safety mechanism from a bow or gun, increasing its ranged haste rating by 88. Using this kit causes the bow or gun to become soulbound.<br />
<br />
<br />
Last but not least, a couple of very interesting items were datamined on Cataclysm Beta servers. It looks like engineers will get a new type of items, very similar to gems.<br />
<br />
Fractured Cogwheel (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/59480/fractured-cogwheel/) - +132 Mastery Rating<br />
Quick Cogwheel (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/59479/quick-cogwheel/) - +132 Haste Rating<br />
Smooth Cogwheel (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/59478/smooth-cogwheel/) - +132 Critical Strike Rating<br />
Subtle Cogwheel (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/59477/subtle-cogwheel/) - +132 Dodge Rating<br />
<br />
<br />
Flashing Hydraulic Pump (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/59491/flashing-hydraulic-pump/) - +132 Parry Rating<br />
Precise Hydraulic Pump (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/59489/precise-hydraulic-pump/) - +132 Expertise Rating<br />
Rigid Hydraulic Pump (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/59493/rigid-hydraulic-pump/) - +132 Hit Rating<br />
Sparkling Hydraulic Pump (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/59496/sparkling-hydraulic-pump/) - +132 Spirit<br />
<br />
<br />
They also seem to use a new kind of socket called &quot;Hydraulics socket&quot;, at this point it could be anything, really, but it definitely seems that engineering will get some love in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />

<br />
Hand-Mounted Pyro Rocket: &quot;Permanently attaches a hand-mounted pyro rocket launcher to your gloves, allowing a skilled engineer to deal 1654 to 2020 Fire damage to an enemy at long range. The rocket can only be fired once every 45 sec.<br />
<br />
Can only be used on the engineer's gloves, and doing so will cause them to become soulbound.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hyperspeed Accelerators: &quot;Permanently attaches hyperspeed accelerators to a pair of gloves, allowing a skilled engineer to increase their haste rating by 340 for 12 sec.<br />
The gloves can only be activated every minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reticulated Armor Webbing: &quot;Permanently inserts reticulated armor webbing into gloves, increasing armor by 885.<br />
<br />
Attaching the armor webbing causes the gloves to become soulbound. An Engineering skill of 400 is required to keep the webbing active.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
and with the increased Stamina in mind same dmg for the new rocket seems kinda.... low<br />
<br />
and the new armor enchant.. i would prefer 885 permanently instead of 1500 for 12 sec every min<br />
<br />
then again.. the new belt enchant seems decent and the new socket looks nice as well</div></div><hr />

The current 885 armor is more than half the new amount, and has a five times greater uptime... And the burst increase of survival isn't enough to be considered a CD. Didn't Blizz also say they were going to nerf armor in Cataclysm? <br />
<br />
It feels safe to assume these are also placeholder stats.<br />
<br />
Well I guess it'd be kind of nice macroing it to Shield Block. Looking forward to it!</div></div><hr />

It seems Blizz decided that the toys Engineers have had so far where not enough to make them be taken seriously in PVE, so now Engies have a stat boost to be on par with the other professions and they can still make their toys.<br />
There will obviously be limitations on the number of gears sockets you can put in your equipment.<br />
But overall not bad at all.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ANeM</div><div class="date">2010-07-12, 10:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess for the Hydraulic/Cogwheel stuff is that its for the epic helms, since they have no secondary stats. The blue/yellow sockets are just placeholders, and the new engineering &quot;parts&quot; will basically take the place of the secondary stats, allowing players significantly more customization with their engineering helms, and, potentially, the ability to upgrade them to keep pace with new content, without having to build a whole new helm or lose the enchant/meta on the current one.</div></div><hr />

secondly I'd guess Engineers'll be able to socket some equipment themselves with that hydraulic or cogwheel socket, like BS does for JC sockets.<br />
But I think they have to decide for either hydraulics or cogwheels. And there may only be 1 Socket to be added.<br />
Anyways I love it! :D</div></div><hr />

As for the video.... I know a lot of people thought TotalBiscuit was annoying, but there's a difference between what some think is an annoying voice and just being downright annoying. If TotalBiscuit had done this quest series, it would've been a single video that lasted around 10-15 minutes tops.

As for the video.... I know a lot of people thought TotalBiscuit was annoying, but there's a difference between what some think is an annoying voice and just being downright annoying. If TotalBiscuit had done this quest series, it would've been a single video that lasted around 10-15 minutes tops.

Thanks, I totally agree, this QuestLine Video was complete garbage, and not worthy of a mmo mention. I watched all the videos on the CynicalBrit site, and while the Worgen was in 3 videos, its pure content, and he fades out all the crap of him getting lost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Whoopdie f****n do.I don't see why it wouldn't stack, considering the behavior of every single other thing where you can add a socket versus adding an extra enchant. Blacksmiths can still enchant gloves and bracers they've added a socket to, and the existing engineering improvements to belts can also be applied along with an eternal belt buckle.<br />
<br />
<br />
My guess for the Hydraulic/Cogwheel stuff is that its for the epic helms, since they have no secondary stats. The blue/yellow sockets are just placeholders, and the new engineering &quot;parts&quot; will basically take the place of the secondary stats, allowing players significantly more customization with their engineering helms, and, potentially, the ability to upgrade them to keep pace with new content, without having to build a whole new helm or lose the enchant/meta on the current one.That's one option, alternatively they'll still add extra stats to the goggles later on, and the cogwheels/hydraulic pumps are actually going to be an engineering enhancement for a specific gear slot that can be sold to other players, which would address the common complaints engineers have that their profession doesn't have many ways of making money compared to other professions. Especially since they're removing the need ranged weapons have for ammo.</div></div><hr />

spirit cloth googles too pls (my holy priest is engineer)If people are correct with their theory that the new cogwheels/hydraulic pumps are actually gems specifically for the goggles, that's basically your way of turning the generic item into one suitable to your role. For tanking one could, for instance, take the melee DPS goggle and then put in a Fractured Cogwheel and a Flashing Hydraulic Pump, and you'd have a pretty respectable tanking helm there. For healing you'd add spirit to it through a Sparkling Hydraulic Pump and you can then choose another stat of your choice to add to it.<br />

First, it seems a dps item, 2nd it's written MELEE DPS, 3rd doesn't seem like a tank item. There is this strange concept that the warrior needs more hp of a mage, actually you should see it more like A TANK needs more hp than a DPSER. Obviously there is mitigation in the equation too. But anway the durability should decrease when the dps increase, that's the only thing that should happen.</div></div><hr />

Yeah I thought they were tank goggles because they have 512 stam on them. My mistake, thanks for pointing it out three times in one sentence.<br />
<br />
Anyway, it looks like stam has been basically equalized for all classes, which still feels weird. I don't think there should be a great divide between cloth and plate wearers. Though certainly a Warrior or Death Knight really should have more health than a Mage, regardless of spec. Granted maybe these engineer goggles are special or listed incorrectly. However I really hope that my fury warrior and a holy priest won't both be rocking 50k when cata comes around.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Reconstructs your helmet into goggles and permanently adds a cogwheel socket to your helmet. Requires a level 60 or higher item.<br />
<br />
Cannot add more than one socket to an item. Can only add a socket to your own armor, and adding a socket binds the item to you. The added socket requires that you maintain --- engineering or it will become inactive.<br />
<br />
<br />
... which is actually a suggestion I made on the forums a long ass time ago.<br />

Hey- one of my suggestions already made it in: making the engy transporters into usable items instead of trinkets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The most interesting thing is, of course, the &quot;gems&quot;. The speculation our guild has concluded upon is that these &quot;gems&quot; will simply go into special engineering-only sockets which we will either be able to add to off-suit items (trinkets, rings), or will be found on engineering-only equipment like the goggles.<br />
<br />
By doing this, Blizzard no longer has to create multiple versions of each piece of engineering gear, nor do they have to create a brand new tier of these items as each new raiding tier is released. Instead, they just release one version per armor type with a boatload of generic stats (Stam, Crit) and two of these engineering sockets, and let us pick which &quot;green stats&quot; we want to put in them. When a new raiding tier is released, they simply buff the engineering &quot;gems&quot; across the board.</div></div><hr />

I agree that the current version would be better overall. However I checked on Wowhead and they changed the current version to be 700 armor for 12 seconds with the 1 minute cooldown. So for my tank I think I'll probably switch to an actual enchant instead of this, possibly the mastery one. I feel as a tank I already have enough emergency cooldowns that I don't want to pop this one as well.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hand-Mounted Pyro Rocket: &quot;Permanently attaches a hand-mounted pyro rocket launcher to your gloves, allowing a skilled engineer to deal 1654 to 2020 Fire damage to an enemy at long range. The rocket can only be fired once every 45 sec.<br />
<br />
Can only be used on the engineer's gloves, and doing so will cause them to become soulbound.&quot;<br />
<br />
Hyperspeed Accelerators: &quot;Permanently attaches hyperspeed accelerators to a pair of gloves, allowing a skilled engineer to increase their haste rating by 340 for 12 sec.<br />
The gloves can only be activated every minute.&quot;<br />
<br />
Reticulated Armor Webbing: &quot;Permanently inserts reticulated armor webbing into gloves, increasing armor by 885.<br />
<br />
Attaching the armor webbing causes the gloves to become soulbound. An Engineering skill of 400 is required to keep the webbing active.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
and with the increased Stamina in mind same dmg for the new rocket seems kinda.... low<br />
<br />
and the new armor enchant.. i would prefer 885 permanently instead of 1500 for 12 sec every min<br />
<br />
then again.. the new belt enchant seems decent and the new socket looks nice as well<br />

Having one of your profession perk go to trash after a single patch, is kinda annoying. Theres no reason they couldn't scale goggles with at least ''regular mode'' equivalent helms. Or add equivalent goggles every patch to keep people busy, or add an ''googgle improvement'' that requires you to farm to update your current goggles yourself.</div></div><hr />

I am an engineer and I actually DON'T WANT to wear the goggles from the start of the expension to the end of it. There are lots of awesome helmets in the game and I quite like to show them, so I don't want to be wearing some spacy looking goggles all the time (though of course some of the time its fun). <br />

Not saying goggles should be superior to tier helmets of every instance, but equivalent, so people who like goggles can wear them, or people that don't like them can use anything else.<br />

<br />
<br />
Both have a great deal of usefulness. While the 885 permanent obviously lowers your damage overall, the 1500 for 12 seconds every minute allows you to use when you know the boss is about to do a special melee ability, and those are mostly on cool down timers, so you mostly know when it is going to happen.</div></div><hr />

Let's consider the proffesion we're talking about for one moment, the profession that has always been &quot;the fun&quot; profession, which alone put a lot of people off it (in cases where fun does not =/= good, which is alot), and on top of that, the profession which has usually always costed a lot of time, gold, or both, to level.<br />
<br />
I for one, as someone with a dwarf rogue of 300 engineering who has just hit Outland am very happy to see these changes which may put it in league with the likes of, not least, jewelcrafting. If you're complaining about engineering of all things becoming overpowered for once, then you need to seriously re-evaluate what you consider the grounds for becoming overpowered to begin with. Paladins, for example, a class that has access to all roles (save ranged dps if we're being specific), becoming overpowered in most, if not all their roles in wotlk with their access to all/most roles in mind to begin with is certainly no ground for being overpowered. A profession which has always existed primarily for comedy/gimmicky value, which 99% of time has drawbacks, such as useful things such as trinkets/items often being dependant on chance for effectiveness, being for once given the opportunity/means by which to be overpowered for once certainly seems fair, nevermind a good investment for any aspirants/admirers from afar of the profession.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That was my first thought, since Blizzard has done a good job of keeping things balanced. My prediction is that they will all be balanced with probably JC/BS a little bit ahead for most classes in Cataclysm.<br />

Brb rerolling OUT engineering... no tankgoggles?! For all of WotLK I've endured being an engineer, despite it being bad across the line for a tank, hoping it would get better..and now they just ditch the tanking goggles altogether? I hope this will be corrected!<br />
<br />
The reinforced (plate) and agile (leather) are the tanking goggles. Defense is being removed in Cataclysm, and armor is going to be equalized across all roles not just tanks. So they are the dps/tank hybrid goggles.<br />
<br />

meant to kill a raid full of people with the same fucking HP as him?<br />
<br />
Those attacks are being removed across the board for the most part according to what Blizzard has said so far. The shift will be to healers managing mana and dps not sucking. Imagine that, for once the raid will be balanced on dps (which makes up a good 75% of the raid). Also, tanks will get talents to increase their health/armor and cool downs to reduce incoming damage. This isn't really all that far off of how druid tanks work currently. You share your gear with dps, but you have tank survivability in it.</div></div><hr />

not to sound ungrateful but that little tidbit of engineering really didn't get me excited, all it showed was we can at least make some money in cataclysm, and unless they have something to upgrade the goggles through every tier, they will just be replaced at the first raid instance you walk in.<br />

<br />
So to compensate for being underpowered, Engineering should be overpowered? That's the worst idea ever.<br />
<br />
Engineering is a fun profession. Giving it access to buffs equal to JC/enchnating/BS is ridiculous, because then there's no reason to be the other professions. Unless they make all other professions have unique perks and fun gadgets like engineering (unlikely), then this won't be fair. <br />
<br />
If you want to min-max your character, get BS and JC. The gains in it aren't game breaking, so you're not really losing out on much. If engineering and its flavor items appeal to you, go ahead and get it. But be prepared to make a small sacrifice in stats. That's called balance.</div></div><hr />

*sigh* Okay Captain Brilliant, Let me tell ya a few things.<br />
<br />
For one, the enchants are almost guaranteed to be placeholders at this point. Most of them have the same values as their current Wrath counterparts, so it's pretty damn obvious.<br />
<br />
And for two, if you'd actually read, you'd notice what others said about the goggles. The blue and yellow sockets are probably placeholders for the new Engineering &quot;gem&quot; sockets (for lack of a better term) since the goggles are such a high level and have no rating stats. With defense being removed, you will be able to gem the melee DPS goggles accordingly to make them either DPS or Tank-based. Same goes for the healer/caster DPS goggles.</div></div><hr />

Because they want to be able to justify having the profession they love so much on the character they play the most. If it doesn't have a bonus equal to that of other professions in terms of stats then they will be laughed at or told to change professions. Blizzard is trying to make it so that all professions give the same stats across the board.<br />

Man, some of you people play with some shitty people. Laughed at or told to change??? Hahaha stop pugging with 12 year old raid leaders for christ sake. It's sad that they have to balance with this kind of bullshit in mind.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Wow, so much for Blizzard's garbage about &quot;we want you to make your own choices and not just use cookie cutter setups.&quot; The boost to potions means that engineering is going to be required across the board in every single serious raiding guild now.<br />
<br />
Umm.. not sure if you know this but eng have always gotten that. Runic injectors? Ever heard of those? Why are people so dumb as to post qq about blizz and a buff before thinking/researching?</div></div><hr />

If you're not getting the most (or at least comparable) out of what you can do you're letting 9 (or 24) other people down. This isn't a &quot;12 year old raid leader&quot; comment. It's a fact. In my case I dropped Engineering, which I really enjoyed, for Jewelcrafting when my Death Knight hit 80 at the start of the expansion so that I'd have that little extra health and wanted to be the best tank I could (the other prof he had was Mining which gave the same stam bonus regardless). Now I've taken up Engineering up on my alt for bgs and wg.</div></div><hr />

It's pretty simple, really. A profession can't have fun gadgets AND the same stat bonus as other professions because that means everyone will have it, so I foresee even duller engineering options in Cata. <br />
<br />
BC's stuff was pretty cool, but it couldn't compare to the MC cap, charge helmet, or other Use items that were situational but awesome. BC had 3 good items: rocket boots, flame turret, and the transporter's malfunctions. <br />
<br />
LK's engineering is just horrible. There's nothing fun. You can say the attachments are kind of neat, but they're just trinket effects that do nothing unique. Jeeves is a repairbot, the bikes are just mounts, and almost everything else is a direct conversion of old recipes. The exception is the X-Ray specs. The one fun item.<br />

It was your own choice to sacrifice fun to satiate the need to turn a game into a job, not mine or Blizzard's. You decided that, hey, that 40 stamina and peer approval is far more important than what YOU want in the game.<br />
<br />
Comments like this one I'm quoting and the &quot;OMG ENGINEERING IS AWESOME I R REROLLING&quot; earlier in the thread paint a bleak picture of what it is people want in this game. How can you get excited from copy/pasted JC gems for engineers? Do you have any interest in &quot;fun&quot; at all?</div></div><hr />

It wasn't for peer approval and I don't treat the game like a job. I treat everything in my life with this attitude: try to be the best that you can. What I want in WoW is to do 25-man raids with friends and as I want to do the best that I can I changed professions.<br />

I do want fun, but not at the sacrifice of stats. I know my attitude towards professions is not one that everyone shares and I'm able to accept that. You, on the other hand, can't seem to.<br />
<br />
Blizzard's attitude seems to be very simple as well: they want all professions to be on an equal footing with regards to stats so that it's down to the player's choice which they have on their favorite character.</div></div><hr />

It's just ridiculous that Blizzard is wanting things to be balanced and have fun gadgets. <br />
<br />
5 bowls of ice cream are laid out before you in equal amounts. They are all different flavors, but you'd like them all. But one of them has hot fudge on it. Ask any kid and they're gonna go for the hot fudge one because it is the same amount of ice cream with extra fun stuff. They'd probably ponder their decision more if there was less ice cream with the hot fudge, and that's what we (non engineers) want. The other flavors of ice cream will pale in comparison to something with so much extra stuff at no cost.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Alternative scenario:<br />
5 bowls of ice cream are laid out before you in equal amounts. They are all different flavors but you'd like them all. One has hot fudge on it, one has whipped cream, one comes with slice banana and the other two have equally interesting additions to people with different tastes to you. <br />
<br />
That's what Blizzard is going for. You get the basic stat bonus (same as everyone else) but with a twist that makes it different as well as some other bonus that the other professions don't have. If everyone has a fun gadget or quirk with their profession, regardless of what their profession actually is, what's the problem?</div></div><hr />

I know it was said a bunch of times before, but it had to be said again to preserve balance in the universe. Totalbiscuit could expound on metaphysical meanings behind the quest about Mankrik's wife for an hour and be more entertaining.<br />
<br />
As for engineering, how many times has one profession or another suddenly become the flavor of the moment and all the obsessive-compulsive types immediately switch to it to eke out 0.2% more DPS or whatever only to switch again when some later change might spreadsheet out to be 0.2% beyond that. If you're chasing them to the point that you're only taking them for that, good luck ever catching it or being satisfied with it. I'd love to see them add some unique effects to engineering as well, don't get me wrong, but realistically anything useful is just going to be a copy of something else that some other class or profession provides, or it'll be a novelty that doesn't have any meaningful impact on encounters. It's been that way for years.</div></div><hr />

You're a retard. Engineering is a better profession in LK than it ever was in previous expansions. Oh and Jeeves is NOT just a repair bot, he is a portable butler that offers remote BANKING for the engineer. And engineers also have portable MAIL BOXES. If you can't figure out why those items alone are better than any other engineering items you should probably consider getting tested for autism.</div></div><hr />
