Human Female Model Feedback<br />
The new Human Female model was released on Thursday, and Bashiok took the opportunity to comment on some feedback and questions about system requirement changes.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/thumb/newHF01s.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/newHF01.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/thumb/newHF02s.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/newHF02.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/thumb/newHF03s.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/newHF03.jpg) http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/thumb/newHF04s.jpg (http://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2014/january/newHF04.jpg) <br />
<br />
As we've said, we're looking to in essence update the original models, even though in actuality making them completely from scratch. Out goal is to keep the &quot;spirit&quot; of the originals, but increase poly count, texture resolution, and animation (to a pretty amazing effect, we think. What we're not looking to do is change what these characters are and what they've been. We already face a huge hurdle in that we're messing with what is the most iconic and personal part of the game - a person's character. A digital representation of themselves in the game world, even if if that representation is a giant cow-man. Way above and beyond anything else in the game, changing how someone looks is a monumentally delicate task. We want to keep the proportions as similar to the original models as possible, we're going to keep posture and silhouette close to the originals, but all just with a much higher level of detail. When you see your character it should still be your character, and these should still be representative of the player character models we've all been playing as for the past 9+ years.<br />
<br />
It's really tempting to want to make major revisions, but someone chose to play a character largely because of the way they looked, and it has come to represent their in-game identity.<br />
<br />
That's all well and good! But making her skinnier and more waifish, especially in WARcraft, seems like the wrong direction in which to have deviated.<br />
I would have to respectfully disagree that she deviates to any great degree from the original model when compared side-by-side, except that the proportions are slightly more full.<br />
<br />
Here are the two shown in the preview without any alteration. - http://i.imgur.com/VaIphPC.gif<br />
<br />
Ok well this is taking all sorts of weird turns, so I'll just close this thread by saying there's no commentary here on anything outside of the game, nor should there be. This is the original model launched with the game with more polygons, higher resolution textures, and better animations. That's our goal, and we think we're creating faithful reproductions of the originals.<br />
<br />
My question is, do you have any idea at this time what that demand is going to be? I have signed up for Beta and my computer specs are listed there, but I also know that I get lag in raids and high graphic environments, like flying through heavily colored areas.<br />
We don't, and we tend not to have updated system requirements/recommendations until most content is in, most big changes and engineering are done, and we're looking like there isn't going to be anything else that would greatly affect performance. So we won't really know absolutely until some point through the beta. We're keenly aware of the system requirements the new character models may require, and how that could impact client performance. No further details yet on how they'll be supported on lower end systems, if at all.<br />
<br />
Fun fact, the game still supports processors and graphics cards that were released over 8 years ago. To put that in other terms, modern day systems are in some cases 50x more powerful than the lowest end systems the game still supports. Moving us forward graphically in such a dramatic way with the new models is going to require a lot of testing, tweaking, optimizing, and determination of what we can realistically support going forward, but we just don't know what that will look like yet. <br />
<br />
Would it be possible to include the old models as a option so that users with older computers can opt out if the new models do cause some frame-rate lag.<br />
That's of course something we've considered as a fail-safe, but again just don't know quite yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
Season 15 PvP Gear<br />
Patch 5.4.7 updated the Season 15 gear (http://ptr.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Prideful+Gladiator) to be item level 550, as well as switching the colors that the Horde and Alliance get.<br />
It probably goes without saying, but just in case: we'll be increasing Base Resilience and Battle Fatigue to keep things in line.<br />
<br />
So what's next? 80%? 90%? 100%?Are just going to stand there and blink at each other?<br />
We totally agree that having Base Resilience and Battle Fatigue numbers so high is not an ideal experience. We don't like it either. We want to significantly lower, or possibly even remove them in Warlords.<br />
<br />
Thing is, doing that requires a lot more underlying work to be done first. Health pools, ability scaling, mana regen... all of those need some pretty substantial adjustments. That's not something we'd consider doing mid-expansion, but in 6.0 (where we're already shrinking numbers down via the item squish), we can.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, we want to be able to offer PvP'ers some new gear for the new season, and in order to do that, we need to tone damage and healing back a bit. We have to work within what we have currently available, and that means increasing Base Resilience and Battle Fatigue.<br />
<br />
Are you going to tone down scaling with some classes? WW and rogues scale ridiculously well with agility and damage is insane right now. I know with the increase of resil it should help, but I feel like it's not going to be enough.<br />
We're definitely looking out for any balance changes that will be necessary. I don't have any specifics to share at the moment (we'll know more after we can get some testing in) but there will likely be some. (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/291138-prideful-gear-is-il550/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/11422312312?page=2#30))<br />
<br />
I'm 50/50. I'm concerned that PvP gear will be much easier to get than equivalent PvE gear. But yet is indeed harder to acquire than timeless or LFR and should as such be better. I would vote for 540, which is flex level.<br />
It's important to remember that Flex gear can be upgraded to item level 548, and has extra advantages through things like sockets and set bonuses. We don't feel that the extra 2 item levels on Prideful pieces are going to make them more desirable for Flex raiders.<br />
<br />
And yet non-arena gear remains the same. So my days of PVP for a bit are over. I have no desire to &quot;Arena&quot; or RBG. Yet I get screwed more and more for PVP<br />
If you're referring to Honor gear, as in previous seasons, we'll be making the last season's (Grievous) gear available for Honor.

Karazhan Crypt<br />
Oh yeah, I remember that! Haven't seen a screenshot in quite a while. Not sure I know the story on it but knowing our development processes back then there tended to be a lot more stuff made that we just didn't use. I can't imagine the game rating rumor is accurate, because if it was content we wanted to use we'd just take out the upside-down sinners or whatever the issue was and use it for whatever it was we wanted to do with that space. It's not like they're permanent fixtures. Fun rumor though! More likely we just changed our minds.

Tyrael's Charger as a Store Mount<br />
The regions are separate ecosystems, and availability of items within one region vs. another aren't usually particularly noteworthy because you're never going to see that player in Taiwan on your server with that rare item you got for logging in during some event, or got through that limited time promotion. We think it kind of sucks that a pet collector in Europe could never hope to get that China-exclusive Golden Pig pet from back in 2007, or that just because you live in a region with a different business model where the Annual Pass didn't make any sense, that you never had a chance to get a Tyrael's Charger. We definitely do not want to undermine the exclusivity of someone's mount or pet between them and their friends, or guild, or server, or region, but we think it makes a lot of sense to have equality of items ... not even their availability necessarily, but just their existing, throughout all regions.

Speaking of holiday event rewards...any chance of a corgi vanity pet like the one in the Greench cave sometime in the future?<br />
Always a chance! Seems to be lots of enthusiasm for more dog breeds w/ both players &amp; designers. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/421004378678366210))<br />

Warlords of Draenor Stats<br />
Will STR still add parry in WOD or not? Cause both AGI and INT increase crit right now.<br />
Currently, the plan is that yes, Str still gives Parry for Str-users. And Agi still gives Dodge for Agi-users. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/420720246375215104))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
But to clarify that statement, I think fiddling with DR's is like fiddling with core of arena. I'm afraid of results.<br />
You and me both, but we think it's the right move to make the game better. There will be challenges to overcome. (Source (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421724199837655041))<br />
<br />
dampening imo was a bad fix, you can't tell me that there isn't a better fix that doesn't gimp a specific roll!<br />
One role prolongs a fight. One role ends it. We have to address one of them to avoid a stalemate. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421370690416017408))<br />
a dmg buff would be recieved better then a massive FU healers debuff. It would let the healer contribute more offensively also<br />
I'm not sure about that. I think we'd just see a lot more &quot;what hit me?!&quot; complaints (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421403780882513921))<br />
<br />
Any plan for a PvP version of Proving Grounds ? Something like arenas vs NPCs to learn the ropes ?<br />
I would love to do something like this. Not sure when/if we'll get to. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421391447539978241))<br />
<br />
Is necrotic strike affected by BF the same way heals are? If not what's the reasoning?<br />
Oh no, not this again. Necrotic strike is affected by Resilience because it is damage. It is not affected by Battle Fatigue. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421055488231354369))<br />
I get damage being mitigated by res, but surely the heal absorb should be affected by BF? It has become OP as BF has increased<br />
No it should not be reduced by BF because it is not a heal. It is a damage spell. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421281008604827648))<br />
<br />
Please use the item squish to get rid of base res.Balance PvE numbers after PvP.Priorities are different but that would help alot!<br />
We dislike how large base resil and battle fatigue numbers have gotten too. Out goal is to reduce or eliminate both in Warlords. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421280062877347840))<br />
<br />
could we ever see a solo queue RBG group finder? i feel like it could use the in-game voice chat that never gets love<br />
You'll be able to use the Group Finder to find RBG groups. Like the idea of someone forming/running groups instead of queueing. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/421049629342302208))<br />
<br />
World<br />
Have you tried making the world feel more alive? Dynamic instead of static? NPCs pacing around feels robotic and artificial.<br />
Yes. In fact, there might even be engineers experimenting w/ tech for that right now. Experimenting, mind you. Maybe. (Dave_Maldo (https://twitter.com/Dave_Maldo/status/420989083515498496))<br />

<br />
I really hope that's an option, kinda worried about how well my computer will perform. And yeah, some smart arse might comment about progress marching on and ask &quot;why don't I upgrade&quot;, but as my disposable income is rather slender I can't justify buying a new system to continue playing 1 game.

To say that is seriously just absurd. The models aren't skinnier, weak, or frail looking. In fact, she looks more toned than anything with those beautiful new textures. <br />
<br />
But seriously, have World of Warcraft players got nothing better to do? Better pick something to complain about! The world would simply stop spinning and fall out of orbit if you could be content with anything.</div></div><hr />

It is NOT horrendously expensive to upgrade your machine when you're that far back on your tech, not even close. You'd probably be actually pleasantly surprised how much power you can get by saving a little bit of money and buying anything that isn't the tippy-top end hardware. Do it a piece at a time.

You'd be surprised about the amount of WoW players that play with lower end PC's. Heck there's many, many WoW players who only play WoW and don't play other games, with many hardly knowing much more about gaming in general. I used to think such a statement would be ridiculous but now I'm meeting people like that all the time that run WoW on the lowest settings. I would not be surprised if they lost 15% of their player base with such a move.</div></div><hr />

It's better than keeping a bunch of people who really have no place gaming to begin with. <br />
<br />
Not to sound like an elitist snob but they've had YEARS to catch up on things and invest a little bit of money. Even at fifty dollars a month, over several years, they could now have a very capable computer to play WoW maxed out with no problems and they wouldn't have to dread updates like this. Nor would they have bled themselves dry doing so in the process.<br />
<br />
I just don't have sympathy for people who clearly are unwilling to invest and have been holding everyone else who ARE invested back all these years. Mind you I am not talking about the high-end computer gamers but the larger base in general that actually stays somewhat updated rather than utilizing a decade old computer because they actually CARE.<br />

But you do sound exactly like an elitist snob. I suspect you are the one in LFR wanting to kick anyone doing less than 100K dps who is there to gear up because you already geared up and forgot what it was like to be the lowbie. Surely you weren't the one wanting to kick my discipline priest for only doing 65K dps while I was healing?

I don't think he sounds like an elitist snob. My pc is 4 years old, and it wasn't even high-end back then; yet it can play WoW at a quite satisfying level of graphics without a single problem. The 10-year-old PC at my parents' house, on the other hand (that was low-end even then), can play WoW at the absolute lowest graphics settings. <br />
<br />
Are you saying that someone who can't bother to buy a couple of upgrades every few years can still claim as much right to play the game as anyone? Especially a game that's supposedly always evolving to stay fresh? Would you demand the same from games like Skyrim? If my PC was a Pentium II I bought in 1998, should I have also demanded from Blizzard to have a super-ultra-low graphics version of the game just for me?<br />
<br />
I understand that Blizzard doesn't want to alienate people with low-end systems, and I agree with that stance. But there needs to be a threshold on what is acceptable as low-end and what is definitively obsolete.</div></div><hr />

My discipline priest is a healer who does dps as a sideline. Both my priest and my main hunter have the legendary cloak. The priest is tops in heals and the hunter is tops in dps. And I have an up to date computer. However, I do have more patience with my fellow players of WOW. The point is that your expectations are not &quot;having some form of expectation&quot; but expecting everyone to play up to what you think your abilities are. And no, no one need be left behind just to please your inflated opinion of yourself.<br />
<br />
What are you talking about? I seriously got lost in all that babbling and I'm not trying to be cheeky or cute here. Again, all I expect out of anyone is some kind of effort. That was my whole point.<br />
<br />
That includes trying to update their rig from time to time so that Blizzard doesn't stick with models that looked like crap even for when they were first released almost a damn decade out of fear of alienating a chunk of their player-base. My argument, again, is you don't need a powerhouse machine to do this and you don't need to have great income either.<br />
<br />
Just a little money here and there, save up, buy smart. There is a lot of folks out there that'll even help with the build. If people cannot manage that, they do NOT belong in gaming. It's really as simple as that. You cannot, and should not, indefinitely cater to individuals that clearly have no interest in trying to stay somewhat relevant with the times.

Basically if you're not running double Titans, six cores and 32GB RAM at the very least, you should not be able to play the game or even attempt to do so. You'd only be slowing the higher ups.

Not necessarily. You didn't have hundreds of pandas doing world raids did you? With the updates 90% of the models will be up to that detail and quality.<br />

I don't think it's going to be as bad as people think and if it is... again, you need to just upgrade, you've fallen way too behind.<br />

Hmmmm. It would be interesting to find out how many of the player base would be cut out with those minimums. Especially with your recommended minimum of 20/20Mbps D/U @ 20ms ping since most of us are at the mercy of our IPs in that regard.</div></div><hr />

People can get tablets these days that will run WoW at 60+ fps, I recently got the Surface Pro for like $600 and it runs WoW perfectly. Only time it takes a dip in frames is in raids; comparable laptops would probably cost the same or less depending. Intel HD 4000+ graphics can handle WoW pretty damn well if the CPU is good.<br />

A 580GTX or even something of the 600 series would do you great for WoW.<br />

I'm about to upgrade to the 780 Ti (700-800 USD) to replace my 680. However, not really for WoW but rather Wildstar and The Division when it comes out. I play at 1080p though and freak out any time my frames drop below 60fps, even during PvP and raids.<br />

With shadows off and weak to no AA, it takes very little to run WoW great. Hell, most of these people aren't even running on a 1080p capable monitor so that makes it all the more easier! <br />
<br />
That's why there is no excuse not to upgrade. With tax returns for US citizens, now is a good time to do so if WoW is really your game.</div></div><hr />

Let's talk about a theoretical person named Bob. Bob works a crappy 9-to-5 job to support his family; at least, it's supposed to be 9-to-5, but he ends up having to put in a lot of unpaid overtime to make deadlines. Between rent, utility bills, food, school expenses for his two kids, he doesn't have much money at all for entertainment. He could save up for a few months and buy a new PC game, but all the games released today have requirements far beyond the PC he still has from college. Console games would require investing in, well, a console. But his old rig still runs WoW, and $15 a month? That he can manage. It's actually a lot of entertainment for his money, with new raids coming out periodically, PvPing, questing, all sorts of things to do. It's just a great way to unwind after a grueling day at the office.<br />
<br />
But then one day, Mike Morhaime suddenly gets hit by a bus, and a man named Kelliak learns that he was somehow related to the dearly departed Mr. Morhaime, and he has inherited a controlling interest in Blizzard Entertainment. Kelliak wastes no time installing himself at the top of Blizzard's command structure, and he has a new direction for WoW, a brighter, more ELITE future for the game. Graphics artists are hired by the truckload to produce the new, high-resolution graphics that'll cover every inch of the game world, and soon, WoW is indistinguishable from any game produced in the year 2014.<br />
<br />
Of course, sacrifices have to be made, and unfortunately, the new WoW just won't run on Bob's old computer. Separated from both his source entertainment and the social groups WoW let him interact with, Bob seeks out a new thrill to spend his meager entertainment budget on, and he finds it in cheap beer. Bob soon becomes a drunkard. He loses his job. His family leaves him.<br />

Oh my god, dude, you need to be a script writer for a comedy show. All that leading build-up to the last bit concerning alcoholism was epic. Seriously, that could have been a SNL skit.<br />
<br />
If I inherited WoW, I'd do what it's doing now. I might have done the model updates a bit sooner but all-in-all, I wouldn't change that much. Spells need more flare and visual force behind them, yes, but again... I'd do it the way WoW is doing it. Make the increase in visual fidelity to the individuals spells and draw down spells from other players.<br />
<br />
Models? I wouldn't give you a choice to go back to the old ones. My artists worked too hard for that to happen and having people operate on two completely different looks of the game is not ideal. Instead I'd give sliders and tweaks to on-screen character displays for NPCs and PCs. This would range from lower texture resolutions on other characters, animation reductions, etc. That way it by and large looks the same but the cost on the hardware is reduced significantly according to player preference.<br />
<br />
That all said, Bob could still upgrade his machine for 800-1000 USD and play WoW with the new character models very well with some research and forethought put into it. He doesn't need to buy it all at once, he can take bits and pieces at a given time, and eventually create a machine that puts him leaps over what he was previously playing on. That's why it is wise, if this is something you love, you invest small amounts over time to keep somewhat relevant in the hardware department.<br />
<br />
And trust me, as rough as Bob's situation is... he can still do it. Just isn't going to happen all at once because of his financial situation. Not to mention how the hell is Bob playing anyway if he's doing all this overtime and has his hands otherwise full with his family? I'm single and typically work a solid forty hours a week and I find myself at times too busy to really invest in WoW.</div></div><hr />

Let's just reword your argument into what it really is: &quot;Screw everyone else, I want 10% more polygons.&quot;<br />

I'm going to say the exact opposite is true:<br />
<br />
It's completely reasonable for people currently running the game on older hardware to have some expectations that they can continue running the game on that older hardware.<br />
<br />
It's not reasonable for people currently exceeding the recommended system requirements to have expectations that the game cater to them specifically at the expense of those running the game on older hardware.<br />

It's also not as if the minimum system requirements don't increase each expansion. I've got an old PC in another room with a GPU that shifted from supported to unsupported in Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

Bob works a crappy 9-to-5 job to support his family; at least, it's supposed to be 9-to-5, but he ends up having to put in a lot of unpaid overtime to make deadlines. Between rent, utility bills, food, school expenses for his two kids, he doesn't have much money at all for entertainment. He could save up for a few months and buy a new PC game, but all the games released today have requirements far beyond the PC he still has from college. Console games would require investing in, well, a console. But his old rig still runs WoW, and $15 a month? That he can manage. It's actually a lot of entertainment for his money, with new raids coming out periodically, PvPing, questing, all sorts of things to do. It's just a great way to unwind after a grueling day at the office.<br />
<br />
But then one day, Mike Morhaime suddenly gets hit by a bus, and a man named Kelliak learns that he was somehow related to the dearly departed Mr. Morhaime, and he has inherited a controlling interest in Blizzard Entertainment. Kelliak wastes no time installing himself at the top of Blizzard's command structure, and he has a new direction for WoW, a brighter, more ELITE future for the game. Graphics artists are hired by the truckload to produce the new, high-resolution graphics that'll cover every inch of the game world, and soon, WoW is indistinguishable from any game produced in the year 2014.<br />
<br />
Of course, sacrifices have to be made, and unfortunately, the new WoW just won't run on Bob's old computer. Separated from both his source entertainment and the social groups WoW let him interact with, Bob seeks out a new thrill to spend his meager entertainment budget on, and he finds it in cheap beer. Bob soon becomes a drunkard. He loses his job. His family leaves him.<br />
<br />

<br />
As much as I dislike discrimination what you painted is the picture of someone that's poor but who is unable to unwind without WoW with the ONLY other solution being alcoholism. If that's what society's come to it's sad.<br />
Meanwhile while 'catering' for people that should know better you're keeping a game, that's otherwise pretty great, in the late 90's (yes because when it came out it already looked outdated compared to its peers)<br />
Do note that:<br />
1. Graphics fidelity does NOT mean lifelike models and environments<br />
2. Improving a game's engine or changing it, does NOT mean increasing spec requirements because most engines WILL scale if developed with that in mind.<br />
<br />
In essence, blizzard has brainwashed a lot of people into thinking<br />
1. Their game looks gorgeous<br />
2. They're doing all that's humanly possible to keep the game great<br />
<br />
There's other games out there that will run nicely on your setup and look like they're from 2014. WoW runs nicely only when you give it a ton more processing power than it should for a game with such low poly counts.</div></div><hr />

You do realize the majority have systems that exceed the recommended system requirements at this point by a significant amount, right? Again, we're not talking about 2k machines. We're talking about machines that run under a thousand dollars that make what these &quot;lower-end&quot; players are using look like they're being ran off of a hamster in a wheel.<br />
<br />
So actually, it WOULD be unreasonable for people with machines at the extreme bottom end of the spectrum to expect requirements to stay as they are. It can't happen if Blizzard wants to advance the look of Warcraft and help keep it SOMEWHAT competitive with a growing market.<br />
<br />
What is with you guys? You don't need to buy a thousand dollar video card to get the results you need. Get that in your heads. You don't need 32GB of RAM. You don't need the latest processor. You don't even need much of HDD if all you're playing is WoW. It is not this &quot;leap of death&quot; you guys seem to think it is. The spectrum doesn't range from 1999 crapware to BAM 2013 SUPER-SHIZ with nothing in between. I really do not, in any way, get your issue with this.<br />
<br />
At some point you have to upgrade, it is inevitable.<br />

<br />
I'm talking about how badly optimized WoW's code is. Your fps is linked to the network code, when the net lags/slows down/can't keep up your FPS drops whereas it should go up because you're not feeding new information about the scene. That fact means that even when you upgrade substantially and your internet latency stays the same (not a choice, more like lack of choice) you get crap fps.<br />
<br />
Anyway I agree with your points in this thread. What I wish for is blizz scrab their engine and re-do it like triple A studios have been doing it. We keep hearing about how it takes severe programming acrobatics to achieve something in WoW's engine while in others it's just a few sliders to move left or right.<br />
<br />
A new engine would also allow them to support a broader range of specs and scale nicely with good hardware keeping everyone happy.<br />
Instead we get a bunch of new mounts on the cash shop<br />

Screw up? The old human models just rubbish looking for a 2014 game, they have blown all expectations with the new models. <br />
Only thing they did was uplift the texture &amp; increase the polygons. <br />

Did I hurt the fanboys feelings? My point is that Blizzards goal was to keep the look and feel in tact, they didn't succeed with that. The female gnome and human look like they are from another game. Yes the models look good for todays standards, just not like they are related to the originals.</div></div><hr />

I have to respectfully disagree. As I see it, the new models so far have really kept the soul of the old ones only adding more detail and life. It sounds like by your standards they shouldn't have changed at all, and what would the point of updating them be, if they would still have that old and out of date look?</div></div><hr />

A number of people were attached to the old models and didn't want to use the new ones. I don't see any real reason why the same thing can't happen here.<br />
<br />
That said, I really like what I'm seeing so far. My first character and my current main are both human females. I'd love to see how they'd look with the new models. I don't see how this model looks anything close to waifish. Looking at the comparison shots, they're pretty much exactly the same (the lower legs seem slightly more slender, and the body all-around seems more toned because of the new texture). I'm anxious to see what the orc females will look like.</div></div><hr />

The models look amazing so far, and they've done a damned good job keeping them close to the original.<br />

So much this. Case in point, I had a family member who recently broke down and upgraded their pc from 2006. 2006! Because his wow client would lock up while trying to run recount in current raid content. That is absolutely beyond pathetic, but that's the crowd that's sweating bullets over this change. If you aren't at least willing to upgrade your computer every eight freakin' years, you may just need to consider a new pass time, no offense.</div></div><hr />

Heck there's many, many WoW players who only play WoW and don't play other games, with many hardly knowing much more about gaming in general. I used to think such a statement would be ridiculous but now I'm meeting people like that all the time that run WoW on the lowest settings. I would not be surprised if they lost 15% of their player base with such a move.<br />
<br />
It depends on your frame of reference though when you refer to &quot;lower end PC's&quot;. A low end PC in 2014 doesn't compare with a PC from 2005. That's how I took the comment you referenced. I'm all for WoW not requiring a $200 video card, but if you're playing on a machine that you got when you started high school and you're out of college ... for cryin' out loud get a better machine.<br />

It's for people who didn't have the option to subscribe, because of various reasons, in different regions. That's what I gathered from the post, but I might have misread. <br />
<br />
Either way, if they were to put it in the US stores, I wouldn't care. I mean, I did at first, but the more I thought about it, the more I realized I was being an ass. Come on, D3 for free, a beta key, and a mount, for playing WoW for a year. (Was that everything? I think so..) Damn. Some people just don't have the option. Some can only afford WoW here and there, but they might be able to save up, or get money from holidays, to get that mount in stores, and who am to say &quot;NO IT'S MINE MINE MINE NO TOUCHY&quot; because I was fortune enough to be able to pay all year round (which I was gonna do anyway) and get a bunch of free shit? I don't want to be &quot;That Guy&quot; who cries when Blizz wants to give people the chance to get something again, who might not have had the chance the first time around..<br />

The new body is the same size but with more muscle tone, which fits more in a WAR world.</div></div><hr />

While yes the graphics done by &quot;Amateurs&quot; are amazing at times ... SL still runs like shit from all the stuff running in the background, and struggles to load. Even on my friends crazy ass computer.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Keep in mind though, this game's engine is NINE years old... NIIINE.<br />
<br />
They even said at Blizzcon that this is the max their engine could take, any more and the engine would crash.<br />

Can't wait to see the human male model though!</div></div><hr />

I hope they don't take any complaints about the model revamps seriously. Last time they altered art because of fan feedback we got the worgen female model travesty.<br />
<br />
Except that was because it was rushed and unfinished, not just because of a redesign. Let's not forget that the males turned out just fine.</div></div><hr />

And the 'updated' WoW human model looks like absolute tripe and shite in comparison with what is possible in Second Life, where the engine allows you to build your own environments, housing, clothing, and combat rules.<br />

It's a role playing game and they're right - the basic character is important to remain intact. The people that argue &quot;they didn't look at their character/don't care, update more!&quot; should realize that their argument is over - they don't care about/look at their character so why does it matter?<br />
<br />
Looking forward to the rest of the updates!</div></div><hr />

They are both heavily one sided to the Horde. Then you throw in Auch, which is closer to even, but you will still have a huge Horde advantage on the 3 servers. If they think this will make more people play Alliance over there, then I want some of what they are smoking. If anything it will drive more Alliance off the server leaving it just the way it started.</div></div><hr />

Just to reiterate what blizz keeps saying, they're NOT balancing factions, just merging servers to give more pop.</div></div><hr />

If some of the new models come atleast in some point of the expansion, it's still better than the dance studio.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MrShowtyme</div><div class="date">2014-01-28, 04:40 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Let's talk about a theoretical person named Bob. Bob works a crappy 9-to-5 job to support his family; at least, it's supposed to be 9-to-5, but he ends up having to put in a lot of unpaid overtime to make deadlines. Between rent, utility bills, food, school expenses for his two kids, he doesn't have much money at all for entertainment. He could save up for a few months and buy a new PC game, but all the games released today have requirements far beyond the PC he still has from college. Console games would require investing in, well, a console. But his old rig still runs WoW, and $15 a month? That he can manage. It's actually a lot of entertainment for his money, with new raids coming out periodically, PvPing, questing, all sorts of things to do. It's just a great way to unwind after a grueling day at the office.<br />
<br />
But then one day, Mike Morhaime suddenly gets hit by a bus, and a man named Kelliak learns that he was somehow related to the dearly departed Mr. Morhaime, and he has inherited a controlling interest in Blizzard Entertainment. Kelliak wastes no time installing himself at the top of Blizzard's command structure, and he has a new direction for WoW, a brighter, more ELITE future for the game. Graphics artists are hired by the truckload to produce the new, high-resolution graphics that'll cover every inch of the game world, and soon, WoW is indistinguishable from any game produced in the year 2014.<br />
<br />
Of course, sacrifices have to be made, and unfortunately, the new WoW just won't run on Bob's old computer. Separated from both his source entertainment and the social groups WoW let him interact with, Bob seeks out a new thrill to spend his meager entertainment budget on, and he finds it in cheap beer. Bob soon becomes a drunkard. He loses his job. His family leaves him.<br />
<br />
But hey! At least WoW is pretty again, right?<br />
<br />
Yo, Bob needs a new job or needs to quit sucking at his current one that he has all those unpaid overtime hours to meet deadlines. He needs to put his money into night classes to educate himself on finances. No one that is cutting it that close from paycheck to paycheck should be wasting money on a subscription based video game. SPEND TIME WITH YOUR DAMN WIFE AND KIDS BOB!!! <br />
<br />
Seriously tho, they can update f'n 10 year old models finally, stop complaining. Bob can still play minesweeper with his windows 98.</div></div><hr />

And yeah, some smart arse might comment about progress marching on and ask &quot;why don't I upgrade&quot;, but as my disposable income is rather slender I can't justify buying a new system to continue playing 1 game. And as I've been playing WoW for 8 years, it'd be a shame to have to quit over something that could theoretically be an optional visual upgrade.<br />
<br />
Do the Pandaren hurt your performance, or the new Garrosh model? if not then your gonna be just fine, they will tune it to work I don't think you will have to worry too much.<br />

Ya I mean that is what a average active female would look like in most cases, your moving around a huge ass world fighting things 10 times your size I am sure everyone would have abs lol.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Zadoc</div><div class="date">2014-01-29, 02:11 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">TL;DR: Some 1980 TV SCi-Fi, with a super-b*tch baddy, the supreme empress of the Federation, called Servalan. This is her. Compare to one of the screenshots of the new high poly human models:<br />
<br />
I'm sure many WoW players will be aware of the UK TV series Dr Who. Well, back in the late 1970s/early 1980s, around the time Dr Who was at its peak, there was another more adult oriented sci-fi series on the BBC called Blakes 7. (That's adult as in complicated gritty plots etc, not nudity and profanity - it was shown on BBC1 in the early evening) The sets were just as wobbly and low-budget as Dr Who back then, but it had some great writing, and it was great TV. The baddy, for once, was a female. Far FAR more charismatic and sexy than the good guys, she specialised in androgynous haircuts and running the federation whilst wearing faaaaabulous ballgowns. Check Youtube, there's plenty of clips of her.<br />
<br />
Anyway. This is Servalan. Or possibly Servalan as a younger woman. Or her daughter, or something. <br />
<br />
http://i222.photobucket.com/albums/dd237/Zadpics/WoW-Servalan_zps2c3f1df4.jpg<br />
<br />
Check YouTube though, she looks even more like the model than the one in the photo. <br />
<br />
I should say - I'm not complaining! I just need a realm where Servalan isn't taken as a name.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Beet</div><div class="date">2014-01-29, 03:47 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Man I can't help but laugh at this thread. Seriously I can't believe so many people think it's perfectly fine to keep graphics to a minimum rather than asking a few people to upgrade their computers from a decade ago. And no you don't need a computer that costs thousands of dollars to run WoW. You can build one right now for a couple hundred dollars and it will run WoW 10x better than your crappy PC from 2007. But I guess that's just such an unrealistic thing to expect. I mean people have no problem buying their star pony mounts from the store and are begging to be able to buy instant 90s, but expecting someone to upgrade their rig once every 10 years? UNTHINKABLE!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also....the hair. Why does the hair look so horrible?<br />
<br />
The gnomes are a natural upgrade from the original version.<br />
The undead is a natural upgrade from the original version.<br />
The orc.......is still a peon.<br />
The dwarves are a natural upgrade from the original version.<br />
The human....apparently got bishslaped by mother nature and aged 20 years by heavy drinking (probably from pvp) .<br />
<br />
This is like wanting your 2004 pixels to look like Lindsey Lohan.......only you picked the current coked out version rather than the one that did Herbie.</div></div><hr />

You still don't get it. You're ignorant and all you wanna do is moan about graphics... Go play Crysis or something then.<br />
THIS IS WHAT THE NINE YEAR OLD WOW ENGINE CAN HANDLE.<br />
<br />
If they could upgrade them more, they most likely would.</div></div><hr />
