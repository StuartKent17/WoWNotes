So, I guess i'll wait and see. The most powerful trait being essentially auto unlocked on the outside is just a huge ? from an rpg design standpoint.

I think most of their problems are Lead Developer Syndrome, or Prima Donna-ism. They're smelling their own farts and enjoying it. They need to be taken down a few pegs, and made to LISTEN more, and be more willing to accept that their ideas aren't always going to be successful, or the best ones - and be more willing to own up to them, earlier, not after an expansion is over.</div></div><hr />

I'm not a fan of the azerite system, but putting the best trait in the center would be causing WAY more of an uproar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So, good RPG design, with something meaningful to work towards? I mean ya, if they took away the good traits with no compensation and moved them 10 levels deeper into the middle, there would be an uproar.<br />
<br />
But that is how it should of been in the first place. There is nothing meaningful to work towards in the azerite system past the outside ring.</div></div><hr />

I don't disagree, I think the whole thing is an experiment that isn't working, but they're committed to it, until patch 9.0. Removing tier was a bad idea. They're screwed no matter what they do.</div></div><hr />

The short term changes are fine. We'll have to wait for content patch 1, or PTR, to see what the long term &quot;building on the system&quot; changes are. If it's meh for the first tier and then fixed entirely in the first major content patch or start of the second raid like Artifact Power was in Legion it should be fine.</div></div><hr />

I don't know if a full rework is necessary. <br />
<br />
IMO. Ditch the defensive/utility traits entirely. They are the worst offenders of being unrewarding. Change the center from being +item level to something that scales indefinitely like Concordance buff in Legion. But instead of a primary stat let them be 3 separate secondary stats. That way collecting more Azerite is always rewarded</div></div><hr />

lol That is not good enough if raid situations or PVP situations as the rest of the game has moved on from that. Death Grip was strong in WotLk but since then you have classes with mobility with two charge systems or classes that have better death grips/slows.</div></div><hr />

Charging or slowing does not let you move a mob to a desired location. All the Demon Hunter Fel Rushing in the world isn't going to be as helpful as yanking a mob away from what it is walking to in fights like Aggramar.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You have a very poor concept of barely.<br />
<br />
We know a fair amount of bad azerite traits will be removed, replaced with more active instead of just &quot;10% more damage on this spell&quot;<br />
We know that he has nothing to do with shamans but that they will be getting hopefully fixed in 8.1<br />
we know that island expeditions are seen as a problem for them, and they plan to overhaul reward, system, and mechanics for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is like saying Cheat Death is awesome when every other version of Cheat Death is better. People don't bring Rogues to raids because of Cheat Death. It is because of CloS and Feint + Elusivness talent.<br />
<br />
Death Knights need a huge buff to survivaiblity if they are supposed to be immobile because of death grip.</div></div><hr />

no - but dramatically change the importance of them. As a source of azerite they're dull to do. Give us other options at least (hells - we could at least ignore scenarios in mop)</div></div><hr />

What class has better death grips?</div></div><hr />

If a class like a DK or Elemental lack mobility to dodge mechanics they need to have proper survivability in return. It is as simple as that.</div></div><hr />

That is like saying Cheat Death is awesome when every other version of Cheat Death is better. People don't bring Rogues to raids because of Cheat Death. It is because of CloS and Feint + Elusivness talent.<br />
<br />
Death Knights need a huge buff to survivaiblity if they are supposed to be immobile because of death grip.<br />
<br />
Nice dodge. I didn't ask about Cheat Death, and Cheat Death is irrelevant. I also never mentioned survival.<br />
<br />
I'll ask again, what did you mean when you said, &quot;...classes that have better death grips/slows.&quot;? What other classes have Death Grip? I know the answer. I just want you to acknowledge the correct answer. Which is, none.</div></div><hr />

Do you even play a DK? Your ignorance of the class is glaring. As Blood/Unholy I have no trouble dodging raid mechanics or soaking them reasonably. We're no Rogue, but ugh, they've been king of soaking for a looong time. I admit DKs are weak in PvP when getting zerged, but that has nothing to do with dodging mechanics. You seem to be cherry picking the scenarios that cater to your ass-pull complaints.</div></div><hr />

I, personally, would have liked that. I'd rather play a closer to finished game than this because now it still feels extremely beta.<br />
I don't mind 2-4 more months of Antorus, there are countless other games that I can play meanwhile + still log on wow for random mount runs/achievement runs etc. Especially with Legion, people were racing to get as many Mage Tower challenges done towards the end of the expansion as possible so a few more months, for a change, would have been welcomed here.</div></div><hr />

Some classes and specs can mitigate or outright avoid mechanics while DKs and Elemental must avoid as they have poor survivability. Not saying every class and spec should have Cloak of Shadows but it is clear that a lot of specs suffer due to this new design paradigm.</div></div><hr />

Did you honestly expect anything else? Blizzard have historically been absolute masters of the non-answer, with almost everything resulting in some variation of &quot;yes, we're looking into it, we've got lots of things planned&quot;; which, of course, is a lot of words for something incredibly unhelpful because what do they think we assumed, that they were just not working at all or what? Concrete and definitive answers are a very rare exception.<br />
<br />
If anything, the most information lies in which questions they pick to answer, because that at least gives you some hints as to which complaints they're actually taking seriously, and which ones they are giving the silent treatment hoping they'll go away. The latter is often the case when they're making a paradigm shift that's not popular, but is not going to go away; an example would be the new prolonged leveling process, which I do not expect them to pick as a question/answer (or just in a very cursory way at best).<br />
<br />
For real information, we can only wait for Blizzcon. Or just wait in general, until they come out with concrete details.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I don't really like this answer. The Artifact system was well liked last expansion, even if the grind for the final traits wound up getting a little silly. What makes it a 'treadmill' and Azerite not? Because they'll be occasionally changing things? Because the traits change slightly with new items? I'd much rather have the old Artifact 'treadmill' where I can SEE what I'll be getting and decide what path I want to take ahead of time, and not have it change when I get a new item.</div></div><hr />

We're also looking at how we spawn islands, from a layout perspective, to add a bit more variety from visit to visit.<br />
In particular, we want to add more new events to increase the variety of the experiences players have when jumping into Expeditions, or running the same pool of islands repeatedly. <br />
but we'd love to explore applying the underlying tech upon which Expeditions were built to other settings that don't have that same pacing.<br />
In short, future BfA updates will include not just more content within the existing structure, but refinements to that structure.<br />

You also listed the highest DPS classes. Just saying, yes they have gap closers, but they are also the dps kings atm as well. And bleeding edge content for the most dedicated has always been about class stacking a fight. Has been for expansions. By the time all us normies get there it won't be an issue that isn't fixable with slow nerfs and insanity ilvl.</div></div><hr />

<br />
DKs have 2 movement abilities if they talent into Wraith Walk, and AMS alone is a better PvE survivability ability than the entire defensive tookits of most classes. I dunno what game you've been playing, but in terms of tookit DKs are second only to Rogues, Mages and Hunters when it comes to uniqueness and survivability. Death Grip is also irreplaceable, and impossibly useful both in M+ and in some raid fights, so much that you couldn't even feasibly kill M Aggramar without a Blood DK for the longest time. <br />

There is an easy fix and that is two warfronts up at a time. One starting Alliance one starting horde. Not sure why they don't just do that. Won't fix them being boring, but nothing will fix that. It is a scenario in the end made for random groups of randos.</div></div><hr />

WW has many flaws in that it is buggy as hell and why it was made a talent is baffling to me. <br />
<br />
AMS is strong true but still not enough compared to other specs which have lets say CloS + better mobility than a DK due to Sprint, Shadowstep/grappling hook, etc.<br />

I get the impression the lockout is balanced around having multiple of them up at a time. Obviously, that doesn't make its implementation any better. Which has been rocky at best. But I think that's the design philosophy behind it. <br />

A lot of BfA to me seems designed around how it would play out in the end and a general lack of foresight of how it would be perceived in the beginning.</div></div><hr />

I'mma laugh my butt off if he ignores Warfronts. It should have been the second question answered.

Edited to add: Spoke too soon. Wow. They're working as intended, and nothing on the fuckup that benefitted the Horde. They just lost a huge slew of Alliance players, watch. <br />

<br />
Good job, Ion. LOL. Damn. Just when I thought you'd learned something...<br />
<br />
Warfronts don't have to do anything with the Alliance losing players (and it feels childish to faction change due to that). It was due to the racials (especially BE) since Burning Crusade, which were ignored as a problem. At this stage, it would make the most sense to go to the Horde if you want to raid extensively, it's rather sad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Isn't that just a raid? Not being obtuse, but that is just a one boss raid that has a lot of trash. Warfronts are meant for a more casual crowd and for people who don't have access to the higher end raid gearing ability. It isn't meant to replace a raid. But doing what you suggest merely makes them a raid. <br />
<br />
People are forgetting what Warfronts were meant to target and who the audience really is. Make them PvP they are just a battle ground, make them a raid, they are a micro raid. They are to fall between Raids/High M+ and Island/WQ for gearing and alt catchup. And a one off for those people to see them who do the other content.</div></div><hr />

Not what I was hoping for. Nice of him to address it second which makes me feel like they ARE concerned about it but that answer was not what I was hoping for. <br />
<br />
I get that as an Elemental Shaman I'm not going to be blinking all over the place like a mage. I have come to terms with that. But if I'm going to sit in place for a minute and be the immobile, turret caster I'd better be able to deal out more damage than that guy who's running circles around me casting instant cast spells or channeled spells. If I can't deal MORE damage than him then we need more unique things to do than him. At this point in time I can't see myself better in anyway than say a Mage of any spec.<br />
<br />
He mentions that they want Elemental to have it's own strength that people want to bring to a group but exactly what does an Elemental Shaman bring to the table that Mages don't? Capacitor Totem? That's about the best thing I can say that we have for ourselves at the moment in terms of utility because purging can be done by the Mage (Spellsteal even GIVES them the buff) and they can handle moments where you need damage immunity or resistance to deal with a mechanic (allowing them to remain immobile where as WE have to move out of that stuff or die...actually kind of ironic) where as Astral Shift barely helps us deal with such things. Tremor Totem? Any kind of environment where that could actually make a difference like Zul or early versions of Mythrax they make those abilities immune to the Tremor Totem. So it's good on things like the trash in Atal'Dazar...which we can just interrupt. Which melee classes and mages/hunters can do equally well.<br />
<br />
If they want us to be a turret caster then FINE...but give us the tools to essentially let us plant ourselves and start dealing some serious damage output. We need some ability to lock ourselves down, stay safe in that spot, and do what they say they want us to do.</div></div><hr />

again, doing this initially would have stopped the whine wagon out the gate. Personally, I don't care about the warfronts. I'll get my one weekly piece of gear, see them and move on to the things I like. The endless whine could have been avoided and should have been foreseen and easily fixed with starting with two active.<br />
<br />
It doesn't take more than one glance at the forum topic list to go, &quot;Huh, if we release one, Alliance controlled first, do you think the Alliance will complain like small children the Horde got an advantage? Nah, the Alliance never whine about that. Drop one.&quot;<br />
<br />
I mean come on. Simple solution to avoid a PR issue and avoid going &quot;Don't worry, like you thought, there will be more later.&quot; And balances the story out the gate Horde and Alliance both control one and lose one. Either way, this was foolish on their part and could have avoided all this pathetic whimpering.</div></div><hr />

I don't think people would have their pitchforks raise AS high, if they were more open about what they planned on &quot;fixing&quot;. That's the problem, there's zero communication about where they stand on any of this.<br />

<br />
People like FelPlague seem like they want to defend this but i don't see how. The warfront system is clearly designed for when there are about 3 warfronts active in the game, and if that was the case it would be completely fine. That's not the case though because there is only 1 even available. A system designed for 3 but being used for 1 feels is stupid and does not work. This is obvious.<br />
<br />
Ion's answer of &quot;it will be better when there's more&quot; is bullshit because that will not happen until we are at the very least halfway into the expansion. The system being shit for half of the expansion is not okay.</div></div><hr />

Not being obtuse, but that is just a one boss raid that has a lot of trash. Warfronts are meant for a more casual crowd and for people who don't have access to the higher end raid gearing ability. It isn't meant to replace a raid. But doing what you suggest merely makes them a raid. <br />
<br />
People are forgetting what Warfronts were meant to target and who the audience really is. Make them PvP they are just a battle ground, make them a raid, they are a micro raid. They are to fall between Raids/High M+ and Island/WQ for gearing and alt catchup. And a one off for those people to see them who do the other content.<br />
<br />
Forgetting who they target? I think the overarching issue is nobody can really figure out where in the game they fit, and what role they are supposed to serve.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And honestly Horde is cooler, I mean come on.<br />
<br />
They gutted that racial and changed how Arcane Torrent ( I think it was called ) works, so I guess both factions got slapped :p. A bit too late for that though, but thankfully even on my medium RP realm there are guilds that raid extensively on the Alliance.</div></div><hr />

1. we are going to change alot of the talents, but its impossible to just overhaul the entire system<br />
2. i am not a class design dev, so i dont know about shaman, but i can give you a general response<br />
3. we plan to add more events, change a few minor systems, and also change how spawning works<br />
4. ok this one it seems liek that is what he said<br />
5. warfronts are as intended as some players cant log on every day, this should become better as more are added, we did not explain how they worked as well as we had hoped.</div></div><hr />

<br />
in this case classes like monks/rogues/mages/warriors, basically anything with a gap closer can close back in very quickly or deal with the mechanic far easier allowing a higher dps uptime.<br />
<br />
should more mobility also equal less dps? the more a class has to move without mobility the more time it's losing doing dps.<br />
<br />
i mean you can disagree but look at fetid kills, rogues/mages/monks/locks(teleport)/rogues all high mobility, no dk dps no rets no ele's all too fat and slow and lacking gap closers/mobility, therefore benched, it's not very fair is it.<br />
<br />
More mobility should pretty clearly equate to more DPS on a fight that is based around mobility. Stepping out of fire is the movement mechanic in the vast, vast majority of situations in the game. Yes, warriors can gap close back in very quickly, that hasn't stopped Frost from outperforming Fury (or being middle of the pack on fetid). While warriors are using that time to close back in, DKs are landing ranged attacks.<br />
<br />
Is it any less fair than single target focused specs/classes being benched for heavy cleave ones in multi-target fights? Fights, by virtue of having different mechanics, will have favored classes and specs.</div></div><hr />

There could be more media they release ie books, quests, cinematics, short stories, etc where they introduce how we started attacking and having other warfronts. Which is why they only had one warfront to start out with possibly. If the &quot;leaked scripts&quot; are true, wouldnt you want to know how these places started getting attacked? Cause right now we are defeating ghuun, not exactly concentrating on the battle between horde and alliance right now in game besides the warfront. Maybe Next patch more info will be shown and therefore those warfronts may be introduced because it matches the story. Also, this first iteration can help Blizzard find out what is going right and going wrong with waterfronts, so they can fix the next warfronts being introduced to make them better than the first one introduced.</div></div><hr />

<br />
By not releasing content too early in the first place. Why is this on me to fix? THEY DESIGNED IT. It's on them to deliver a quality product that isn't flawed from step one. And charge $60 and $15 a month for. <br />
<br />
I don't mind bugs, they happen. But if I pay AAA prices for a title, what they delivered doesn't cut it, and that's the issue. <br />

<br />
Warfronts are scenarios so I don't see a point in holding back the release of the others to slowly drip them out over the expansion cycle. Better off to use warfronts as a way to front load content and then use raids as the slow drip of content and the release of new zones to keep players interested.<br />
<br />
Bad management of warfronts for sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
AMS is strong true but still not enough compared to other specs which have lets say CloS + better mobility than a DK due to Sprint, Shadowstep/grappling hook, etc.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You cite Rogue abilities because they have the most OP tooklit in the game by a country mile and the only reason Blizzard hasn't nerfed the piss out of them is because the tears would drown out the Grand Canyon because apparently a Rogue is only a Rogue if they have as many defensives, mobility and utility as 3 other classes combined. Hell they whined a bit when Feint was put on a measly 15 second cooldown. 15 second CD on an ability that ignores 50% of the most dangerous source of damage in raids. Meanwhile most classes are lucky to get 30-40% mitigation on a 2 min cooldown. <br />
<br />
Compared to pretty much anything else, AMS is a super strong defensive that saves your hide and cheeses mechanics like no tomorrow, and Wraith Walk isn't what it was in early Legion, it is perfectly usable now. Plus they still have Death's Advance, Death Strike, Icebound Fortitude and of course the unique and incredibly powerful Death's Grip and Gorefiend's as Blood. As a Warrior I'd kill to just have AMS instead of my sub-par 30% reduction on a 3 minute cooldown one. And yes, I know DKs would love to have Leap or Charge, but that's the balancing act. Warriors are quicker, DKs are tougher and bring more unique utility. The only classes that break the mold are Rogues being on the strong side and DPS Shamans and arguably Priests being on the weak side, toolkit wise. Death Knights are exactly where they should be in terms of strengths vs weaknesses.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and every fight has a knock back right?<br />
<br />
I think the mobility is less of an issue for the general public and cherry picking the world first situation isn't an issue. I mean DK on Aggramar?! I mean yeah, DK has never had a niche that made it amazing. Chain lightening on Portal Keeper? No, Shaman have never had a place.</div></div><hr />

Cherry-picking the questions you don't feel like being open about it being something the majority of players dislike is..... fucking bad.<br />
<br />
Issue is if they make plans, and tell us, then we take it as PROMISES and the community is very quick to take ANYTHING blizzard, or even people who are NOT BLIZZARD as BLIZZARD making PROMISES<br />
<br />
for example &quot;blizzard now giving 3 items in mythic cache&quot; was said by wowhead, but is now claimed that it is a promise blizzard made.<br />
&quot;Morally grey&quot; taken out of context, aswell as class accessories, a concept they said they would like to work more on...<br />

I don't mind bugs, they happen. But if I pay AAA prices for a title, what they delivered doesn't cut it, and that's the issue. <br />

It's not on US (well, YOU, as I'm not playing) to fix this. It's on Blizzard to do their fucking jobs better, and right now, Ion isn't.I mean your alternative right now is to just not fix the game and leave it as the mess it is with some of these systems.

a lot of the issues raised and his answers these should have been picked up at development stage,<br />
even at beta they were told over and over on the forums.. Azerite isnt working its boring and a bad replacement to artifact weapons/traits.<br />
<br />
did they just assume those concerns were going to vanish? <br />
<br />
again on the warfronts and poor communications.. they knew the rotations when the expansion went live it didn't get a mention<br />
the excuse about it being on beta is just laughable. they didn't see the rotation a problem but the players have thats the reality</div></div><hr />

warfront<br />
world boss<br />
rares<br />
turn ins<br />
you cannot do those all in &quot;1 day&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
also &quot;half the expansion&quot; we are fucking 1 month into the expansion with 8.1 quick to come, and with it possibly a warfront, save your &quot;half way&quot; until we know if 8.1 will have a warfront or not.<br />
your saying the equivilent of &quot;we are only going to have 1 raid in BFA, cause they havnt made another raid yet&quot;<br />
<br />
I literally did it in one day buddy. Went to arathi. Grabbed the quests. Killed world boss. Killed things for the quests. Killed every rare on the map. It took a couple of hours and i am completely done for the whole month regarding warfronts.<br />
And yeah it's going to take half the expansion, how delusional are you? You think with 8.1 they're going to add multiple warfronts? I can promise you that is not going to happen. We'll be lucky if we get even a single new warfront with 8.1 They are going to be sprinkled into the expansion over time you are straight delusional if you cannot accept that. This makes my point still stand strong: A system designed for at least 3 warfronts DOES NOT WORK when you only have 1 warfront. It will barely even work if we have 2. It will work quite well when we have all 4, but we will not have all 4 for a long time.</div></div><hr />

It's a few hours content at best. Warfront's take around 20 minutes, then kill the elites and world boss take around an hour. None are particularly interesting, mind you. It's just a zerg as the faction piles into them. And then you're done for another month. That's... TERRIBLE for one of two promised core features for the expansion.

a few months in and well...<br />

It's a few hours content at best. Warfront's take around 20 minutes, then kill the elites and world boss take around an hour. None are particularly interesting, mind you. It's just a zerg as the faction piles into them. And then you're done for another month. That's... TERRIBLE for one of two promised core features for the expansion. Its like them saying 'you will ride dragons!!!' then going 'oh yeah. Once a month. For 10 minutes. Sorry'.<br />
<br />
There are more warfronts coming, you know that. It won't be 'once a month' thing at all.</div></div><hr />

Went to arathi. Grabbed the quests. Killed world boss. Killed things for the quests. Killed every rare on the map. It took a couple of hours and i am completely done for the whole month regarding warfronts.<br />
And yeah it's going to take half the expansion, how delusional are you? You think with 8.1 they're going to add multiple warfronts? I can promise you that is not going to happen. We'll be lucky if we get even a single new warfront with 8.1 They are going to be sprinkled into the expansion over time you are straight delusional if you cannot accept that. This makes my point still stand strong: A system designed for at least 3 warfronts DOES NOT WORK when you only have 1 warfront. It will barely even work if we have 2. It will work quite well when we have all 4, but we will not have all 4 for a long time.<br />
<br />
1 month? you are not done, you finished ONE SIDE<br />
you still have the other side to do<br />
you are not done for 1 month, you are done with one side of it, so you are done for &quot;1 week and a half&quot;<br />
in 2 more days you will have more to do, then in about 4 more days you will be able to do the warfront<br />
but as they have said many times, this is not to be on par with raiding or M+ or pvp, this is supposed to be a side thing, like as he said in the very reponse, timewalking.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ok want to make a bet?<br />
the expansion will be 2 years long for sure<br />
half the expansion then would be 1 year.<br />
so if by august 2019 there is not a second, or third warfront you will give me 2 million gold.<br />
if not, i will give you 2 million gold.</div></div><hr />

I give up. I forget who I'm talking to. Even I can't fanboy this hard and I love this company. I'm not buying they are so time consuming to create that two of them couldn't be ready for launch.

Basically just saying &quot;it's bad on purpose&quot;. You hope every week to RNGesus that you get the right azerite piece while the RNG adds up over time, if you get the wrong one you're fucked and start over again. Does this not sound familiar? *cough* Legendaries *cough*<br />
<br />
I've been saying for a while that Ion is overly fixated on micromanaging every experience in the game, from a developer standpoint, and his M+ answer demonstrates that. He's trying to micromanage RNG with 'bad luck protection&quot; because of &quot;feels bad&quot;, which is a bizarre and overly OCD perspective to take from a design standpoint. They've had systems in place that WORKED just fine, and they've removed them for this, which doesn't work, feels bad, but he's gonna &quot;try to do better in the future&quot;. He's on a wild goose chase to some mythical world where drops will satisfy some weird level of perfection he thinks he can create. Which is even more bizarre in that WoW is entirely loot based. Diablo 3 is too, and we all saw how throttled drops worked previous to Loot 2.0. <br />
<br />
Defined goals are not a bad thing. Too much of WoW is RNG based, and they're creating the &quot;feels bad&quot; moments at the same time Ion is trying to fix them.<br />
<br />
Just bring back badges already. They work. Let a player grind towards a reward they can choose. It's all a waste of time.</div></div><hr />

Okay - but even then its not good content. With wow I tend to think 'would I do this if there wasn't a great reward?'. The dungeons, pvp, raids etc? Sure.

Almost 2 hours with 6 questions &quot;answered&quot;.<br />
<br />
There are 4 warfronts that we know of, we will be doing them every week. Yes at this stage of the release it sucks, but we aren't even near the first patch yet. Give them 5 mins to stagger the story out for us, it's not like there is nothing else to do besides warfronts.</div></div><hr />

&quot;Well just fix it&quot;<br />
yeah, fixing shit takes time<br />
&quot;fix the game&quot; <br />
do you really think it is just a switch they flip then &quot;OH GAMES FIXED!&quot;<br />
no it takes alogn time of devlopment to fix something...<br />
<br />
Yeah they plan more, but they cant literally just flip a switch, then banm new ones are out.<br />
<br />
It's not about getting it fixed or how fast it takes. The problem is that it was a poor game design to begin with, which any normal designer should've seen from miles away why it would be bad. A lot of things that needs fixing is more about poor design from start. Also, &quot;it takes time to fix&quot;, do you have any idéa how long players have been able to play Alpha/beta before the game got released? Sure it takes time to fix, but if it takes 6+ months to fix/adjust then I can assure you they are not working on a fix actively.<br />
<br />
After reading all the responses so far it just seems you are sitting with rainbow tinted glasses and act/talk like Blizzard are doing everything good, when in reality they could do so much better.<br />
<br />
For me, the Shaman response was meh. Since he isn't a class designer, and he doesn't have insight on the class itself, he should've skipped the question. People want PROPER answers to shed light on HOW they will fix/adjust/balance something. I personally am playing Shaman, as Resto, since I feel both Enhancement and Elemental are lackluster. I also feel that (as he pointed out) that Shamans are not a go-to healer for Raids nor Mythic+, and the lack of Shaman representation from top-end guilds just proves that the class is a lackluster.<br />
Since Ion does this AMA representing Blizzard, I would expect that he can redirect the question to a Lead Designer, who in turn can provide Ion the answer which he in turn can provide through this AMA. This just shows that he can't be bothered to do that.</div></div><hr />

Bad luck protection is necessary though because of RNG on top of RNG.<br />

Are you implying that legendaries were inherently bad? I don't think so. The only bad part about it is difference between good and bad legendary setup. That was fixed and even more fixes are incoming. Azerite gear got everything good about legendaries and removed bad parts. I don't think we would return to pre-Legion playstyle with simple stat sticks in every slot. That's so old.</div></div><hr />

Treat it like a world boss you do once a week. It's side content for loot, nothing more.</div></div><hr />

5 days now, 10 days come 8.1 15 days come 8.2, 20 days come 8.3....<br />
<br />
We don't have 5 days now, we have 1. So with 5 warfronts that's 5 days.</div></div><hr />

I don't think so. The only bad part about it is difference between good and bad legendary setup. That was fixed and even more fixes are incoming. Azerite gear got everything good about legendaries and removed bad parts. I don't think we would return to pre-Legion playstyle with simple stat sticks in every slot. That's so old.<br />
<br />
The only bad part about legendaries was the fact that with bad RNG you could get majorly fucked. The positive was that almost every legendary was interesting and fun. With Azerite armor they kept most of the RNG but almost none of the effects are interesting or fun. Complete opposite of what you're saying; as it is right now azerite armor has none of the positives of legendaries, but the negatives are still there<br />
<br />
Yes, I know they said they're going to &quot;make more interesting traits and remove boring ones&quot;. They said the same during beta. And their answer to the RNG was that they'll just balance the pieces properly, something they're god awful at. Pardon my skepticism</div></div><hr />
