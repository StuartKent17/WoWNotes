<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dracodraco</div><div class="date">2014-05-30, 01:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Is it just me that finds it odd that people are going &quot;LOL SAME WEEKEND AS WILDSTAR ACCESS, GL TRYING TO GET US TO PLAY&quot; when what this literally does is halve the amount of time you have to spend on the game to keep up? I mean. All of my wats. If you cared about VP, you'd want to cap, wildstar or not. This just gives those people more time to play WS than cap. If you didn't care about VP, you don't care about a buff either way. Are people really so paranoid that everything has to be happening because of nefarious reasons :&lt;?<br />
Not to mention a week long buff won't matter when it's game compared to game, and it won't keep people subscribed that already planned to / unsubscriped (why would they care about VP if they didn't plan to play? &quot;oh, VP is easier to get now, better keep my sub so I can cap VPs for... VPs?). <br />
<br />
If they really wanted to try and keep people from switching, they'd have delayed 5.4.8 untill this / next reset, to reinvigorate progressing people / burned out players with new shinies at the same time as the other game (plus, &quot;forcing&quot; them to cap valors if they care about their character). Instead they did it a few weeks ago. I'd have preferred it to be later personally (as they gave no warning for us to cap our VP to be prepared), but here we are. <br />
Tinfoil hats, tinfoil hats for everyone.<br />
<br />
<br />
Granted im not following posts like i used to, but could you clarify this? What was originally data mined?<br />
<br />
What was originally datamined was exactly what we got. They found the data for a 100% valor buff, and people took it and ran with it, and assumed that we'd be able to cap at double speeds for the rest of the expansion because of... Reasons, clearly. Same goes with the Black Prince quest items, a buff was datamined for the droprates, and people instantly assumed that they'd implement it as a permanent solution to lessen the time to get a cloak (2 months with 3 of those weeks being VP capping aint bad people. Man up). Instead of, you know, letting secrets / runestones drop on more bosses, or just plain BUFFING THE DROP RATE like they did with sigils (why would they need a buff to tell us that this time around when they didn't for sigils back in the day?).</div></div><hr />

The buff was datamined and assumed to go live with the recent patch. It was expected to be permanent by many people. Blizzard didn't comment at all on it just giving their usual &quot;wait and see&quot; speech. Had they just said it was a temporary buff from the start then it would be seen as positive instead of negative like it most likely will now.</div></div><hr />

It just makes valor capping 2x faster. That's not going to compete with a brand new MMO. Half the WoW community are already VP capped at this point in the week, prior to the buff even going out. Then, since the buff makes it 2x faster, if it encourages people to log in during the weekend just to VP cap, then it means they're done in 1/2 the time, and will log right back off again. In no way, shape, or form is this even a remote attempt at 'competing' with Wildstar's pre-launch.</div></div><hr />

Nothing is stopping them from making it permanent, but I feel that this is too little too late. If they had launched this with an increase in the amount of valor you can pull in a week when the instant 90s were released I think it would have made a bigger splash. Reading this right now as one of the unsubscribed and waiting, all i can say is &quot;meh&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Well, if you want to be technical this allows people to cap the VP on their toons FASTER, giving them more time to play Wildstar if they are min- maxers intending to play both games.<br />

This is such a weird thing, what's the point when there's still a weekly cap? Do people really care about upgrading alts?<br />
<br />
Well, some do, some don't. Hard to say who has what interests either. For me it depends on how much time I have, what else I need to do and ect. If I have spare time I try to cap my main and my 2 favourite alts. I don't bother trying to cap all 5 90's that I have.</div></div><hr />

Regardless of how much faster you'll Valor cap with this buff, I'm sure people who had planned on not playing any WoW for the next week because of Wildstar's release will be logging into WoW just to Valor cap all of their toons. All Blizzard needs is for people to log onto WoW.<br />
<br />
That way, their numbers and activity won't look as affected by Wildstar's release. They can say to the investors &quot;See! Everyone still logged into WoW this week despite it being Wildstar's launch week!&quot;<br />

This was deliberately planned and perfectly timed in order to screw with Wildstar. It's not as big as a beta announcement, but imagine all the activity this buff will generate for WoW this week.</div></div><hr />

Explain to me why. If they didn't plan to cap VP, why would this change it? They obviously don't care about VP if they didn't intend to cap it in the first place. Capping takes all of 30 minutes to start with (or you could even do it in 20 seconds if you farmed timeless coins / epoch stones the week prior).</div></div><hr />

You sound quite paranoid. There is no way some crappy speed up your valour buff is going to interfere with Wildstar. It'll just play out as follows <br />

<br />
I have over 500k timeless coins on 1 character (an alt) because I spent all my time on timeless isle on that 1 character due to &quot;Going to need a bigger bag&quot; not being an account wide achievement. Most of my other characters have 15k less timeless coins or less because of that oversight by Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

This is the first I've ever heard of Wildstar. I will bet both that Blizzard's timing of the buff has nothing to do with Wildstar and that Wildstar's success or failure will have nothing to do with this buff.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah that's why this feature is being released the same day as Wildstar early access and not on a Tuesday like everything else Blizzard implements in the game right? It's obviously just a &quot;coincidence&quot; just like when content patches were released when competing MMOs were launching.<br />
<br />
This isn't a pro Wildstar post at all. It's more to laugh at the fact that Zarhym came out and flat out denied they do this on purpose when there is ton of history to the contrary but to be fair Blizzard has got away with many instances of treating their playerbase like idiots.</div></div><hr />

It just makes valor capping 2x faster. That's not going to compete with a brand new MMO. Half the WoW community are already VP capped at this point in the week, prior to the buff even going out. Then, since the buff makes it 2x faster, if it encourages people to log in during the weekend just to VP cap, then it means they're done in 1/2 the time, and will log right back off again. In no way, shape, or form is this even a remote attempt at 'competing' with Wildstar's pre-launch.<br />
Given the reason or lack there of for the buff with it being a shitty buff at that because it doesnt even increase the cap then why is it there. If ever it is a purposeful half ass snot nosed gesture to WS from Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

For starters, I was expecting it to be a permanent buff, not some lame weekend shiz. In addition, at this point, I've already capped 4 characters. This was also announced with like a 10 hour heads up. Oceanic Realms just got it thrown at em no warning.<br />
<br />
This better be EVERY weekend.<br />
<br />
Someone should lay off the angry pills. My main is capped but my alts have recieved ZERO love the past couple of weeks so I'm going to enjoy valor capping them with much ease.<br />
<br />
Just because some people are so darn effecient at VP capping on day 1 on multiple toons (my alts have &lt;5k timeless coins), doesn't mean a buff Blizzard puts in is directed at them and considered &quot;useless&quot;. Sure &quot;useless for you&quot;, now what about the other X million subs?<br />
<br />
HOWEVER, it would be nicer if the valor cap was increased to 2-3k for the duration, I'm still progressing through Heroic Siege (11/14hm) and if I get a new piece of loot it will take my entire weeks valor to upgrade it to maximum potential. A 4/4 heroic piece and a 0/4 heroic WF piece means you need to upgrade the WF piece twice before it's the same standard as the 4/4 piece. May as well not use it until you have upgraded twice. I now have an methodology to my VP upgrades thanks to this.</div></div><hr />

I'm pretty sure 0% of people can get to valor cap in 15 minutes without spending timeless coins. H scenario takes at least 10 minutes. With the bonus you get like 150 for the first one less for each additional. I'd like to see someone do it in under an hour.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Doubtful. The few people claiming they saw others get this in flex over the months were probably just thinking it dropped, but in reality the people already had it prior to entering. Possibly opening up the box they already had, so you could see all the items? I don't know if people can see that or not, but if they can, that is possibly what they were seeing. /shrug</div></div><hr />

Like others, what really should HAVE happened was this buff made it so that I could get 2k of valor on my main for the week...whoever is making the decisions at Blizzard lately needs a reality check to what the player base actually wants/needs...<br />
<br />
Forums here and on bnet have had post after post asking for more cap as we are essentially nerfed with the 0/4 per each new item vs the 0/2.</div></div><hr />

*sigh* so a ten day bonus to valor but cap is still a measly 1000. And besides, typically one caps on one character to get the 50% BUFF THAT IS ALREADY IN THE GAME for their alts.<br />

Production schedule &amp; Milestones. Not buffs that were already in the game just not turned on.<br />
<br />
Assuming that this was even scheduled to coincide with Wildstar, it's not going to do anything and has no bearing on how far along WoD is, sure you may see buffs or even discounted prices, but they won't rush production of the game because of another game being released. People really should read what he said properly, and look up the meaning of &quot;production schedule&quot; and &quot;milestones&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't have to do anything with Wildstar being released. Wildstar gave me eye cancer after 5 minutes of play. God awful UI and really horrible graphics for a 2014 release. And I'm not talking about graphics style but graphics quality.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Regardless of how much faster you'll Valor cap with this buff, I'm sure people who had planned on not playing any WoW for the next week because of Wildstar's release will be logging into WoW just to Valor cap all of their toons. All Blizzard needs is for people to log onto WoW.<br />
<br />
That way, their numbers and activity won't look as affected by Wildstar's release. They can say to the investors &quot;See! Everyone still logged into WoW this week despite it being Wildstar's launch week!&quot;<br />
<br />
This was deliberately planned and perfectly timed in order to screw with Wildstar. It's not as big as a beta announcement, but imagine all the activity this buff will generate for WoW this week.<br />
Huh?<br />
<br />
Tinfoil hat much?<br />
<br />
In fact this lets me play wildstar more because I will be done in WoW quicker!<br />

Having this power spike for alts after a very long time is frustrating due to the fact that on a main character for a heroic raider this has been done before. Why would i want to have to play a huge amount of time AGAIN ?! I won't. Some people will but many of us won't. So that's a fail.<br />

&quot;at least 10 minutes?&quot; all of my wat. Maybe if you go with a tank, a healer, and a fairly low (sub 2-300K) dps. The fast ones takes 3 minutes (my stampede doesn't come back up from the first miniboss in the mine-one for the last boss). 15 minutes is a stretch though, but 30 minutes is pretty doable.

That's basically impossible with the bad rng.<br />
By my observation, they drop approx. every third kill. I also have a feeling that (at least for myself) the efficiency increases with a kill one mob at a time approach.<br />
Killing mob packs doesn't speed up the collection for me. It's rather slowing me down.</div></div><hr />

They want to speed up the catch up mechanics for alts.<br />
Not everyone has unlimited time available. Many people change up their game by playing on a whole army of alts, to not be too much in a repetitive hamster wheel.<br />
Plus, there's still heaps of players that tread the game as a game, and don't confuse it with working on an assembly line. When they get off work, and want to chill, they mean it. Chilling... Rushing and blasting through content is not chilling. It's the opposite.<br />

Now only greedy idiots remain that only care about making more money on a dying game instead of making game better and more playable.<br />
And yes a bunch of idiots, changing things that people asked to be changed 5+ years after, like item squish and insane epeen numbers in WoD, removing mass summon, thinking of removing flying for some stupid reason ( like they want us to see the world ), and now giving us ability to gain VP 2x faster so it wont take us 2 hours, it will 1 hour. I gain VP cap on my alt in 3 HC Scenarios ( 50% more I gain since one char was on cap + 100% more, since they STACK ), thats less then 15min active play. So yes that is a move and decision only made by an idiot leader, instead that leader could say, Ok people raid on 2-3 MAX characters, and not 15 or 50, why not increase weekly VP cap to 2000 instead of 1000 and let them upgrade gear faster so they don't need to spend 3+ months doing that just to upgrade OS gear. Again, if that decision is soooo amazing tell me what will i do with my OS gear upgraded 2 weeks before WoD? Those 2 additional upgrades are just to make people play more since no NEW CONTENT WILL RELEASED MORE THEN A YEAR AFTER SoO...</div></div><hr />

this patch would make much more sense if they raised weekly vp cap by 100% for alts to catch up easier alongside with 100% vp aquiring buff //shrug</div></div><hr />

Good, they should do that. It has nothing to do with difficulty. It has to do with TIME.

Oh I'd bet it won't be anything major either. I'd bet nearly everyone waiting for Wildstar unsubbed from WoW long ago.<br />

Which is why it seems silly they'd make this weak gesture. If they don't fear losing subs, why have an event coinciding with Wildstar's launch at all. If they do, why not something better than faster valor capping.<br />
<br />
Unless it's an elaborate trick, as some have theorized, to let players on the fence grind their weekly valor faster in order to stay subbed to WoW while they try Wildstar. Yeah, I enjoy tinfoilhatting. So what. :)</div></div><hr />

Pretty much my feeling, was hyped up on Wildstar (great game but I honestly cannot support another MMO that has a mainly raid end game, I'll try it out later after the potential/eventual aftermath) but I honestly still like WoW more and forgot MK8 was coming out and with a free game to boot (Windwaker HD here, its been 11 years since I played the original).<br />

The funniest part about all of this is if you seriously didn't think something was a threat you wouldn't even care. The fact that the mere mention of the Widlstar gets people all bent out of shape shows how paranoid you are about something posing a threat to your precious World of Warcraft not realizing that lack of competition allows nothing but stagnation in the industry. But hey if you enjoy doing Siege for the 900th time by all means keep at it.</div></div><hr />

The thing is though if this was a major filler patch that offered a filler raid or a ton more dungeons or some sort of invasion or whatever, then there would be something worth talking about but all it is, is just a minor something that I pretty much doubt will have no real effect on any other game release at all..<br />
<br />
Really people should look at it a bit closer, this update will probably have minimal to no effect to the release of Wildstar and I am pretty sure that Blizz know it too if Blizz were then there would probably be more too it (as I said above) than just a change to how one gets VP's and so on..<br />
<br />
But folks just seem to get bent out of shape for no real reason, because if folks are hell bent set on getting Wildstar then I very much doubt that this change by Blizz even when it comes at the same time as the release of Wildstar, would sway them to come back to WoW..</div></div><hr />

Well this stacks with the already existing 50% valor increase if you cap on one char for that week.<br />
So currently my alts gain a 150% increase in valor.</div></div><hr />

Predictable crap like this makes Blizzard look spiteful and desperate on their ride down from a peak of 12 million subscribers. Paint it however you like, 7.8 million isn't anywhere near 12 million. Blizz knows the sub loss will increase exponentially faster the more subs they hemorrhage. They could easily be down to a million in a few years.</div></div><hr />

Because we all know a simple buff to help people with their alts is meant to to compete against a completely fleshed out MMO with shit tons of content, let alone the thought that this buff is able to sustain players during the downtime period between expansions.<br />

It gets people playing their game. It's highly likely that it is because Wildstar is their biggest threat that they're doing this.<br />

However, if it is only on US-Oceanic and China, then it's not because of Wildstar. It's no big deal.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Production schedule &amp; Milestones. Not buffs that were already in the game just not turned on.<br />
<br />
Assuming that this was even scheduled to coincide with Wildstar, it's not going to do anything and has no bearing on how far along WoD is, sure you may see buffs or even discounted prices, but they won't rush production of the game because of another game being released. People really should read what he said properly, and look up the meaning of &quot;production schedule&quot; and &quot;milestones&quot;.<br />

At this point I think it is likely of a hey we did something if the higher ups complain, but we dont perceive you as a threat. Bit more of a snotty this is how much we care to both the competition and customers. It is nice when you can shift content release points when it suits, but perhaps this time Blizzard couldnt. It is reasonable to think a company cannot completely plan projects around other companies, but in the times you can it would be foolish to not capitalize on opportunities that present themselves especially in a subscription based MMO.<br />
<br />
While we have no idea what direction project Titian was heading the timing of where it was likely at mixed with its back to the drawing board call at the very least was coincidental with news of other developers plans of open world action FPS games. Blizzard does well refining what others make, but Titian would of been a somewhat first for a big name to attempt. Blizzard is a business and with that comes with making strategic moves.</div></div><hr />
