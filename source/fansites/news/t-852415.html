Blizzard deployed another round of hotfixes today, the arcane mage changes are going live and Blizzard decided that it was time to increase the guild XP gains from raid bosses! <br />
Here you'll find a list of hotfixes that address various issues related to the recently released World of Warcraft: Cataclysm patch 4.0.6. Hotfixes are updates we make on our end without requiring you to download a new patch. Some of the hotfixes below will go live the moment they are implemented, while others may require your realm to be restarted to go into effect. Please keep in mind that some issues cannot be addressed without a client-side patch update. We will continue to update this thread in the days ahead as additional hotfixes are applied. Visit our Bug Report forum for a list of 4.0.6 known issues.<br />
<br />
February 15<br />
General<br />
<br />
The amount of guild reputation and guild experience gained from killing a raid boss has been dramatically increased, as the previous rate felt too low compared to the difficulty of progressing through raid content. This change will require a realm restart to take effect, which will be next Tuesday's weekly scheduled maintenance at the latest.<br />
<br />
Shield of Velen guards in The Exodar are now consistent with other &quot;royal&quot; city guards in terms of health, level, and damage.<br />
<br />
<br />
Classes<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/272-Mage) / Cataclysm Talent Calculator (http://www.wowtal.com/#k=..mage) / Skills/Talents (http://www.mmo-champion.com/content/1669-Mage-Cataclysm))<br />
<br />
Arcane Blast (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/30451/arcane-blast/) now costs 5% of base mana before stacking modifiers, down from 7%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons &amp; Raids<br />
Baradin Hold<br />
<br />
Argaloth (http://www.wowpedia.org/Argaloth) despawns and resets properly if the raid wipes during Fel Firestorm.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blackwing Descent<br />
<br />
While flying around the Vault of the Shadowflame, Nefarian (http://www.wowpedia.org/Nefarian_(Blackwing_Descent_tactics)) no longer forces everyone to stand up if engaged.<br />
<br />
<br />
Throne of the Tides<br />
<br />
It should no longer be possible to summon a mount in certain areas of this dungeon.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Shard of Woe (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/60233/shard-of-woe/) (Heroic trinket) now reduces the base mana cost of spells by 205, with the exception of Holy and Nature spells -- the base mana cost of Holy and Nature spells remains reduced by 405 with this trinket.<br />
<br />
<br />
Professions<br />
<br />
Engineering Target Dummies (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/19814/masterwork-target-dummy/) are no longer able to taunt boss-level creatures.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blue Posts<br />
Epilepsy and elementals flashing death effect<br />
We've actually seen a number of forum posts, and received a few letters on the elemental death effects. We have a task set to remove the flashes from the death effect, although as the work hasn't begun I couldn't accurately state when the change might make it in.<br />
<br />
In any case, we agree and we're going to be changing them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/158478/dear-blizepileptics-vs-elementals))<br />
<br />
Lag in 4.0.6<br />
To address these directly, we can't say what any individual ISP may look at when performing any sort of Quality of Service traffic management. There are numerous factors that a traffic management console can monitor and consider as an indicator that throttling a subscriber is required. Those settings and thresholds are between the ISP and, if they choose to divulge it, their subscribers. Blizzard is not directly privy to that information. All we can truly proffer is generic information regarding the technologies involved and how it may impact our users. (Source (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1965992365?page=20#400))<br />
<br />
Bandwidth requirements in the future<br />
As far as increased bandwidth requirements, nothing 'new' is coming in the works, as far as I am aware, that will require enhanced bandwidth. Our published minimum system requirements can change at any time, depending on what improvements and innovations we introduce. What I am saying is that some issues people have been reporting have indeed been traced to their current throughput limitations. This isn't true across the board, but this is the root cause of some of the reports. (Source (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/1965992365?page=20#400))<br />

The Daily Blink - World of Warcraft on the Kindle<br />

There won't be any. Aimed shot will get a slight nerf, but other than than, some of our shots will receive minor buffs.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for that comment about BH resetting if you wipe during felstorm. If your entire raid wipes during felstorm.. you have much bigger problems then the boss not resetting. I would think it is almost impossible for everyone to die during fel storm unless they are doing it on purpose.</div></div><hr />

The trinket was TOO good for Arcane. The item gave a bigger dps boost than anything in the entire game would. It could literally equal to around 15000 mp5 for Arcane.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's still an overall buff to arcane mages with the trinket now vs arcane mages with the trinket before the hotfix. It's just not AS big a buff (read: insane) as it would have been without the accompanying trinket change.<br />
<br />
To quote a poster on EJ:<br />
<br />
Live without Shard: 1219 @AB0, 8533 @AB4<br />
Hotfix without Shard: 871 @AB0, 6095 @AB4<br />
<br />
A nice 28% mana cost reducion right there for people without the Shard.<br />
<br />
Live with Shard: 814 @AB0, 5698 @AB4<br />
Hotfix with Shard: 666 @AB0, 4662 @AB4<br />
<br />
Shard users only get 18% reduced mana costs with the new shard compared to live. The overall mana savings from Shard at AB4 will change from 33% to 23% spell cost with the hotfix.</div></div><hr />

The Shard pre-nerf was the only hope arcane had to be proper raiding spec. Now it just isn't.</div></div><hr />

<br />
... The Googles are best pre-heroic level raiding gear for most specs (since they can be perfectly reconfigured to have whatever secondary stats are good for you), the synapse springs are equal to the the benefit from other crafting professions for nearly every spec, and we get the potion injectors. Engineering isn't overpowered right now, but it's at least as good as and probably slightly better than any other profession in PvE, and we get fun stuff. Which may or may not explode. But it's fun.</div></div><hr />

Arcane is the top single target dps spec for mages by quite a bit. The Arcane buff more than counters the shard nerf, and let's face it, not a lot of Arcane mages were going to get that trinket anyway.<br />
<br />
Arcane suffers because of poor mobility and poor AoE. Shard solved neither of these. It only helped with single target, which Arcane is already more than capable of anyway.</div></div><hr />
