<br />
yeah its 170 stamina, got one a little while ago<br />
<br />
Although like someone said above, they quite crap for tanking, only reason i took it is because of the usual BS for a tank in heroics... (the must have 30k health rule or you aren't a good tank apparently) that took me just over it so it shuts them up while in groups...</div></div><hr />

<br />
It should be. Just calculate however much you make in a ram run plus running around the city. Maybe 2-4days at most. <br />
<br />
Don't forget once you buy the outfit and do the achievement you can return the items and get all your tokens back, so you can buy more too :)</div></div><hr />

on the 10 runs i did he didnt do it, although we did kill him quite fast, only thing he done was disarm with stuns tank for 3 sec or so, but tank doesnt loose agro</div></div><hr />

Pandaren Monk isn't even in the game yet, 3.2.2 files have the monk so it wouldn't be in Brewfest unless they released 3.2.2 on Tuesday.<br />
<br />
@rhorle: East Coast servers atm don't have Direbrew up, we'll have to wait until 3AM (12 Pacific) before Direbrew is up it seems :(</div></div><hr />

Ahhh thanks. I remember a few weeks back when they changed the time of the instance server so its not the same as the server time. Server time is 2 hours off instance time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Its more where your battlegroup or server cluster is located. Pretty sure the cause is upgrades to the instance servers and the preperations for cross-realm lfg. The instance servers are the time of the battlegroup or server group cluster instead of the realm time.<br />
<br />
Hydraxis is central, but its located in seatle so its instance server is pacific. So we have to wait till 2 am server to do the boss in the instance.</div></div><hr />

Exact same thing happened to me. Turned in item, and the number of coins I had went from 95 to 40.<br />

You want to get the Disturbing the Peace achievement, but also buy the other gear from Brewfest and don't know if you'll have the tickets?<br />
<br />
Save all your tickets, then buy all the gear at once. Go to Dalaran, get smashed, get your achievement. Port back to Dun Morogh and refund your items to get all your tickets back. Buy your brew of the month/elekk pet and rejoice. Then, save up the rest of the tickets you get and hope you can buy back the costume.<br />

<br />
Heart of Iron is better *if* you have a predictable spike of dodgeable damage to use it on. Otherwise, no. <br />
I never quite got the math on the black heart, so if that procs more than I'm noticing it might be better as well.<br />
<br />
Both of them kick the crap out of every single other tanking trinket in the game, though. (though I may have missed something in the new raid's loot list. I only saw an armor trinket from the badge vendor)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
they quite crap for tanking<br />
I also must laugh at this. Procs suck. On-use is only good for predictable things to use it on. Whenever the effect isn't up, you have an inferior trinket, and did you know Mr. Murphy has a law about stuff like that? <br />
<br />
Predictability is the name of the game for tanking. 170 stamina is constant. Procs and on-use trinkets are not.</div></div><hr />

It's 25 guaranteed from 2 dailies then you can get another 20-30 tokens for the &quot;There and Back Again&quot; repeatable that you can do every 18 hours or whatever. it's not a daily quest, you just talk to Neill Ramstein and follow the quest dialogue.

For these 2 archievments '&quot;Brew of the Month&quot;' and '&quot;Disturbing the Peace&quot;' you need 550 coins. 50 for the head, 200 chest, 100 boots. 200 for the membership. If you get 25 coins per day, you'll have 325 coins after 2 weeks. I just saved 83 coins. 325 for all dailys + my own 83 = 408 coins.

You can easliy get about 150 tokens the first day. If you do the two dailies, then it will take 8 days to get the remaining 200 tokens for clothes. <br />
<br />
There and Back Again, will give you 2 tokens per drop for the 5 minute run. Each drop gives you about 25 seconds added back to the Ram timer. Each run to Kharanos (IF you hit both of the mid way apple buckets) takes about 28-30 seconds. Unfortunately, you can only do this every 12-18 hours or so.<br />

We have just 2 weeks to earn up to 550 tokens with only two dailys and a &quot;task&quot; that resets at some point... I am still waiting for this magical reset from midnight of the first night. <br />
<br />
If we miss a single opportunity we will fail the meta... what if you cant log on one day? <br />
<br />
We need more dailies!!!!</div></div><hr />

<br />
i've already had brew of the month from last year, but anyway im at 124/350. hope this will be fixed...25 from dailies + 40 from a couple of ram runs is good. 25 from dailies only is not that good :P</div></div><hr />

Since no-one on the EU servers can find the quest but there are some mixed reports about this on the US servers.<br />

How the **** can you get 164tokens in 2 days??<br />
I got 85tokens the first day.<br />
And this morning (second day) only the daily around IF was available. So im at 100tokens now...<br />

It's a stupid requirement in the first place, because some people already completed their daily early on and actually want to get stuff other than the stupid mount, like the trinkets and the daggers. I don't think that a couple of people not having the quest is going to kill you.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Scenario 1:<br />
Imagine person X goes in with 4 other people who have summons. Person X has 5 chances to get [drop] to drop.<br />
<br />
Now imagine person X decides he didn't get what he wants and will try to get into a group when he has no summon. <br />
Each person in the second group (aside from person X) gets 4 chances for their loot instead of 5.<br />
<br />
Scenario 2: <br />
<br />
person Y wants a group to get loots, but he gets a group with person X (and 3 others who did the same as him).<br />
Person Y gets 1 chance at his loot.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
You're not going to think it's so fair if you're the one getting the shaft instead of being a dick to others.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
think carefully<br />
brewfest daily available before the daily quest reset<br />
so the people can do &quot;twice&quot; daily on 1st day<br />
the max number should be at least 180</div></div><hr />

1. hmm, how about if the mount drop, who can ensure the one, who already completed the quest, will not press &quot;need&quot;?<br />
<br />
2. this is the problem of fairless, the guys who have completed the quest have more chance to loot what they want</div></div><hr />

1. how long the event?<br />
2. how many token u need to purchase achievement items?<br />
<br />
number of min. token per day need = (answer of no.2/ answer of no.1)<br />

<br />
Actually, the quests did reset from the year prior. Can't speak for the EU servers, since they seemed to have gotten jipped of a quest for whatever stupid reason, but the quests definitely reset from the year before.<br />
<br />
As for people bitching that others can refund the tokens? Yea, how totally unfair for the people who didn't save stuff from years prior, or who never even got the opportunity to DO Brewfest the year before. <br />
<br />
And personally, I don't see what the huge fuss is about people doing Coren without the daily. Granted, I wont do it personally to a group outside of my friends, who know I'm a mount collector and blahblahblah, and I always tell them beforehand. Outside of those friends/guildies, I just don't want to hear the bullshit but I don't mind when someone in my group doesn't have it either. Someone even tried to tell a person he couldn't roll on stuff because of it. As group leader and tank, I said, you can do whatever because I don't give a shit.<br />
<br />
Talking about &quot;You're just going into a group a mooching!&quot; ...What the hell do you think people do in groups? Stand around and then roll on loot? What if that person is your tank, or your healer? Your highest DPS? Well damn, they didn't do any work at all, did they? Pishya. If someone literally just stood there, or afked or whatever, fuck yea, I'd kick their ass out, but daily or not, everyone is still contributing to the kill.<br />
<br />
Anyway, why the fuck would the group &quot;Greed&quot; on something as desired as a mount? If you want the fucking thing, the entire group should agree to NEED it, that way it can not be ninjad.That would be like walking into the Eye and having the Phoenix drop, and everyone greeding on it.

<br />
You only need 350 tokens (+2 for hops if you don't win the mount) to get the Brewmaster meta achievement.<br />
Save them until you have 350 tokens, buy a hat, chest and boots. Then get drunk and dance in Dalaran while wearing them. <br />
Sell all 3 pieces to a vendor before 2 hours have passed since you purchased them. You now have 350 tokens again. Spend 200 on the Brew of the Month Club membership card, and use the rest for whatever else you might want. All the other achievements are easy and free, and most can be done at the Brewfest grounds outside Ironforge or Orgrimmar. <br />
<br />

Honestly, I disagree, 5 chances at a mount is the only way I or any of the people I run with will do it. Carrying someone along to get a &quot;rare&quot; mount and the only thing they did to contribute was maybe dps, or maybe tank, or maybe stand there. Hell a fucking hunter can tank Coren Direbrew, don't tell me it's omghard. I completely agree with if you brought no summon, you get no chance at the mount, sorry.</div></div><hr />

Well, yea, most people seem to agree with that general thought. So that's the rule I go by when I'm in a group with people outside of my &quot;entourage.&quot; Unfortunately, other people are not as polite as I am about adhering to what other people want, whether they agree or not.<br />
<br />
And in fact, I've seen plenty of ragers who end up doing the same shit to other groups. I guess that's the way it goes in the world of anonymity.</div></div><hr />

If you were smart about this, You would buy the 3 Clothes items, Go get the achievement, then return them for the tokens (They can be returned, I have done this myself) then get the brew of the month. You only need 250 tokens that way.</div></div><hr />

Also please notice that there are still NO blue posts concernig the Ram Racing reset's fuckup: I ticketed a GM on my realm (Defias Brotherhood EU) twice and I got TWO DIFFERENT ANSWERS... one said it's 12h, another that &quot;couldn't tell me which the correct reset is, but it's not 12h&quot;... more crappy answers.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Feralz</div><div class="date">2009-09-22, 09:53 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you were smart about this, You would buy the 3 Clothes items, Go get the achievement, then return them for the tokens (They can be returned, I have done this myself) then get the brew of the month. You only need 250 tokens that way.<br />
<br />
200 for chest + 100 for boots + 50 for hat = 350, broseph<br />
<br />
and my question wasnt how to get the least amount of tokens, it was how to aquire them<br />
i found out you could get tokens not only from the ram daily thru IF, but also from the none labled daily to ram run to kharanos and the dark iron invasion was a daily</div></div><hr />

That was a bug on my server. They did a rolling restart 24hrs later and it was fixed.<br />
<br />
I also find it lame that the clothing is so expensive. There is like 5 pieces to.</div></div><hr />

You only need 3 for the achievement, which is 350 tokens... Not too bad considering you can easily obtain about 40-50 tokens per day, on average.</div></div><hr />
