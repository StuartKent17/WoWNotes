All of it is really a proof that there's nothing exciting happening this BlizzCon at all. Sombra, a fucking hero introduction, was the first reveal. What?</div></div><hr />

Yep, I stopped watching. I'll just spend 30 secs reading a summed up version. This is too boring.</div></div><hr />

Lack of Chris Metzen is really killing the opening ceremony. That and the fact that they have nothing interesting to announce.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Let's not forget Sombra and Mischief.<br />
<br />
Answer: no. Brace yourselves for the least exciting BlizzCon ever. Only reason they had it is likely revenue and the fact that they couldn't miss the anniversaries.</div></div><hr />

To be fair Charity stuff is a good thing. Always nice to do something for charity in the end. Not saying it's acceptable the lack of actual stuff but you get what I mean.</div></div><hr />

I think the cash grab comment is mostly since Blizzard does these pets for the massive tax write off and you'd be much better off donating directly rather than help multi-million dollar companies write off their taxes.</div></div><hr />

This is depressing, but true. It's better than NOTHING, I am sure. But they take your money and donate in their own name for write-offs. It's like that little box McDonalds has to collect your change. They take it and get the tax benefits for it ... not you. You'd be better off saving you own change, donating, and getting tax credit for it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, Chris Metzen is overrated. Just my opinion but he, Jeff, Ben Brode and Mike are not really good at hyping anything. Chris was more cringey with his &quot;for the horde&quot; yell. My opinion, strictly my opinion, it's very important you know it's just my opinion. And a couple of my friends as well but mostly mine.</div></div><hr />

That has nothing to do with you giving them your spare change to donate for you and get the benefits for it... Like I said, better than nothing.</div></div><hr />

Just in case you didn't know, the opening ceremony and all of the esports are free to watch. So if you're not interested in the panels, and you don't care about the in-game goodies, there's no reason to spend money on the virtual ticket.</div></div><hr />

Oh I got the opposite impression... this year felt like they didn't have enough to talk about. I know it &quot;over ran&quot; but they could have easily cut down that HOTS and Hearthstone part. It was if they were scrambling around for things to talk about this year. Which is inevitable I guess. We can't get Overwatches and WoW expansions dropped on us every year regardless of how big Blizzard is as a company.</div></div><hr />

The more I think about it the more annoyed I get that they didn't so much as reference him to at least allow the Blizzcon audience to say goodbye with an applause. Even if he didn't want to appear in person because he knew how it would go... Mike could have still thanked him publicly for all of his work and allow the crowd to do the same.

<br />
That's because there are 3 Fanfests spread out over around half a year nearly. Of course they would do initial stuff first. Tokyo is Christmas Day so more info gets revealed there for example such as the first class then in February the final bits of xpac details get released. It's smart and builds up hype. Also quite a few things got revealed at Vegas such as PS3 support gone, preview of the zones, initial announcements, an endgame zone and a class was heavily hinted at already along with the teaser trailer for the xpac. What would you rather do? Blow a lot of info at the first one then 4 months down the line have nothing to share or hype it up for the next fest in 2 months and then release info there but keep people hyped for the next one? Basically if you have 3 festivals spread out over so little time you use the first one to drum up hype, the second one to release parts of major info and the final one to go overboard.</div></div><hr />

For example back with 3.3, they showed new info about the Icecrown patch in addition to opening ceremony showing Cataclysm announcement.</div></div><hr />

Even if he didn't want to appear in person because he knew how it would go... Mike could have still thanked him publicly for all of his work and allow the crowd to do the same. God damn it.<br />

Btw, I've expected a new Diablo 3 expansion. Seems like we only get a few little additions this time. With their 6 games, one would except to see some real big relevations at their main event. What I've seen is good so far, but major? No.</div></div><hr />

I'm wondering if their game director leaving stalled work on something bigger than what they announced. Pearce doesn't work on Diablo directly, he's an executive, and they usually bring out the game leads for announcements.</div></div><hr />

They might as well have advertised this as Blizz-Esport instead of Blizzcon. Lots of cool / exciting eSport announcements and advertising. I was hoping for SOMETHING more exciting with Diablo. Starcraft and Overwatch was expected amount of 'announcements'. Hearthstone xpac was probably cool for those that play (I don't). Very disappointed there was NOTHING about WoW, hoping that we get some stuff at the WoW Panel.</div></div><hr />

The mini campaign stuff didn't really seem to take off. Now its all Coop. The diablo stuff was nice, although I am a little sad its no actual expansion. This would have been ok if it was 1-2 years ago when they started the seasons. Now I already played multiple seasons with each character and can't really get excited about doing the same again with another class. Yes its my favourite class, but it still won't keep me interested for longer than 2 weeks.</div></div><hr />

No new expansion AT THE VERY LEAST for Diablo 3? No Diablo 4? No remake of Diablo 2? No Warcraft 4? Only one character for Overwatch that I knew about since like June when her ARG went mainstream? No new map ready immediately for Overwatch, just a new mode type going to PTR? No PVE, man vs. machine, for Overwatch? Nothing about 7.2 for WoW, and not announcing that at least 7.2 and 7.3 and maybe 7.4 will be ready next year, but instead only 7.2? <br />

LAME, thats like giving a breadcrumb to a person starving. They released nothing new at all for D3 in years and now they think people is going to think &quot;wow, I am gonna recommit to D3&quot; for 2 new maps of basically nothing. D4 would have been Blizzcon headliner worthy, even new dungeons or new zones or new something for WoW would been blizzcon headline worthy. New maps for a dead game, a few new heroes for heroes of the warfart or Overwatch, the game that is so boring you got bored of it after first week. They playing catchup with such games as LOL etc. and they failing. so is this the sign that blizzard really doesd not have anything new to come with? disturbing at best. and I am happy I did not buy a ticket cause there will be nothing really new in the panels either, mark my words, they will clap themselves on the shoulder for what they already done and nothing more.</div></div><hr />

I figured with it being the 25th anniversary that maybe we'd get remastered versions of their older games or at least the diablo games with that anniversary. Didn't expect anything major from Warcraft or Starcraft as they just had expansions released, maybe a reveal on the next mission pack. Sounds like though the co-op stuff is earning them money with the constant content for it. The other games had predictable announcements, new heroes, new maps, more buy-able content. Deepmind was interesting but really doesn't do much for the regular players. I wouldn't say I'm disappointed in what was announced, but I did have higher expectations with such a milestone.</div></div><hr />

People being critical of Blizzard is now hate? Alright then. People expected way more for D3 especially since Reaper has been out long enough now to warrant an expansion or something actually good for the 20th anniversary like a D1 or D2 remaster. But no some crappy patch and a character pack that will more than likely be half the price of a full game.</div></div><hr />

Regarless if broke or not, 30€ is a lot for a little pet and portraits, but there are people who are into that stuff and are willing to spend money on it, good for them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It lost $40M according to reports. So, yes, it was a flop.</div></div><hr />

All reports were it would need ~$500M to break even, thanks to a $260M combined budget. It didn't get there.<br />

Go read the Warcraft movie thread, we've been over this plenty of times.<br />
<br />
People keep saying it's wrong and it made money but the proof is right in front of your faces. Duncan said we'd get a DC if it made money, no DC. A sequel would have been announced if they had made money. They haven't announced plans for one. It's still possible we'll see another Warcraft film at some point, it just won't be any time soon.</div></div><hr />

Unless you play Hearthstone, there is almost nothing exciting coming up.<br />

<br />
The lack of Metzen took out all the epicness of Blizzcon. I am really happy about the return of the necro to Diablo 3 though and excited about the re/doing of Diablo 1.<br />
<br />
What makes me sad is that HS, HotS and OW take the place of leading products for Blizz. Long gone are the days of Warcraft, Diablo and Starcraft licenses. Shame.<br />
<br />
I'm not a fan of this either. Especially when (in my opinion) Overwatch is the only one of those games that is able to hold my interest for anywhere close to as long as Warcraft, Diablo or Starcraft.<br />
<br />
I think there will be a new Diablo at some point but the fact that they had nothing to announce after 2 years doesn't bode well for the future of that franchise.</div></div><hr />

Well... soon... We have no idea when 7.2 will drop, but early summer seems likely. That would make it about 10 months, which is long enough.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Overwatch and Diablo III are the only Blizzard games that really hold my interest anymore; mainly OW, in fact, although I'm eager to see how they will improve on existing heroes rather than the new shiny one. I struggle to muster enough interest in WoW to ever re-sub to it, even after giving Legion a brief trial after not touching the game for close on 4 years...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Buddy, this was an actual question, not a trolling one. I could have been more clear, however I honestly wondered if this was the first opening ceremony in which there was no actual WOW announcement. Don't be in such a hurry to assume other posters are as trolly as yourself.</div></div><hr />

It's probably going to suck. I agree. Back in D2 it sucked. But god fucking dammit do I like them. The advantage is I don't care if I'm competitive. I'll just dick around with it for a few weeks and quit probably.</div></div><hr />
