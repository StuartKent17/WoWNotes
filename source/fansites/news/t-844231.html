Nefarian US First Kill by Blood Legion<br />
Blood Legion (http://bloodlegion.com/wow/) (US-Illidan) was the first guild in the US to defeat Nefarian in 25-Man Heroic Mode! Congratulations to them for the kill!<br />

Conquest Points - Breaking Skulls and Buying Stuff<br />
Blizzard posted a short guide to explain how Conquest Points work, it's probably a little late and useless for all the PvPers out there but I guess it can be useful if you didn't have time to try the new rated battlegrounds yet. <br />
Bone-shattering PvP conflicts can be harrowing and demanding, but smart gladiators know that if you want to emerge triumphant, you need to walk onto the battlefield well-equipped. <br />
<br />
In World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, certain PvP pursuits reward players with a new kind of currency: Conquest Points. Conquest Points can be exchanged for the very best PvP armor, gear, and weapons in the game, allowing you to hone your competitive edge in the ring and on the battlefield. <br />
<br />
Those Gladiator items are calling, but how do you get the Conquest Points to buy them? There are three main ways to do so:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Winning Arena matches<br />
Winning Rated Battleground games<br />
Winning your first Random Battleground game of the day<br />
<br />
<br />
Each time your team wins a Rated Arena or Rated Battleground match, you're awarded a certain number of Conquest Points; no points are awarded for losing, however. Your first Random Battleground win of the day will also net you 25 Conquest Points. <br />
<br />
There's a limit on how many Conquest Points you can gain over the course of a single week, and points earned from all sources count toward that total. Everyone starts at 0 personal rating with a weekly cap of 1,343, which is the most points you can accrue over the course of a week. Unlike Honor and Justice Points, Conquest (and Valor) points do not have an overall cap.<br />
<br />
Note:There's no benefit to hoarding large amounts of Conquest Points since they'll be converted into Honor (or Justice Points, for Valor) when the next tier of items becomes available, and there are no plans to extend the 4,000 point cap on the lower-tier currencies. That conversion is still rather far in the future, though, and we plan to provide plenty of advance warning before it happens. In the meantime, feel free to purchase items you want as soon as you can afford them.<br />
<br />
If you want to be able to earn more than 1,343 Conquest Points in a single week, then you'll need to increase your personal rating above 1,500 by participating in Rated Arenas or Rated Battlegrounds. Only your best personal rating counts, and as you improve and bring your rating over 1,500, your weekly point cap will rise as well -- and if you manage to achieve a very high rating, your weekly cap could approach 3,000. Here are some sample ratings and corresponding point caps:<br />
<br />
&lt;table style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;tr style=&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;150&quot;&gt;Rating&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td width=&quot;150&quot;&gt;Weekly Points Cap&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1500&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1343&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1800&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;1940&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2100&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2533&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2400&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2849&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;2700&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;2964&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;<br />
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;3000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;3000&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />
<br />
You can check your current total number of Conquest Points at any time in your character's Currency tab. For more detailed information, open the PvP menu and click on the Conquest tab, where you'll find how close you are to the weekly cap and how many points you'll earn by winning an Arena or Rated Battleground match. You can check out what the Conquest Point vendors have to offer in the Champions' Hall in Stormwind or the Hall of Legends in Orgrimmar.<br />
<br />
Now that you know what you're fighting for, it's time to show Azeroth your incredible PvP skills. Confront your foes. Fight! Win! <br />

Outland &quot;difficulty&quot; in Cataclysm<br />
Hi Syrenea. While I certainly commend your desire for difficulty, I don't think we want to slow down the leveling experience. I think most people will agree that they're either leveling an alt and want to catch it up quickly, or they just started playing and want to catch up to their friends.<br />
<br />
Certainly some of the lessons we've learned in quest flow, mechanics, rewards, etc. could make Outland quests better, but we don't have any plans at this time to go back. And certainly not to slow the process down. While the Outland zones maybe aren't as awesome as Cataclysm zones, they definitely aren't horrible, and the speed at which you rocket through them certainly helps the majority hit their end game goals.<br />
<br />
If you're finding the process of being a minor god squishing Outland creatures in your palm a little tedious, maybe find some ways to up the challenge. Pull a few more mobs at a time. Maybe even challenge yourself and add one more every time. Or how about every enemy you kill in under X seconds you remove one piece of gear. I don't know, I think there are things you can do to keep it interesting. If you have any you use and enjoy, share them!

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">DrunkenBeard</div><div class="date">2011-02-03, 11:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">That last Blue Post illustrates one of the points that I absolutely dislike about World of Warcraft : The leveling experience is just a means to get to 85 and nothing more. In my opinion leveling should be a lot more involved and challenging than the current state, it's while you're leveling that you should learn about the lore, learn how to play your spec, learn the different mechanics of the game etc. To sum it up : Leveling should be an emphasized learning experience, not a quick rush through content to get to 85, find that you're actually clueless and start reading forums to get better.<br />
<br />
I think of leveling as going to school, it's long and tedious because you need to meet certain requirements before entering the work market. Same thing applies to WoW, you can't suddenly ask someone to be decent at high levels if the entire leveling exeperience was an easy rush with absolutely no tests. In a way, Blizzard seeing leveling as a means to get another alt or catching up with friends is a factor to the 85 difficuty complaining that we're seeing now. This game definitely needs a more progressive approach from Level 1 to 85.</div></div><hr />

Something is certainly off with it. Plus they should just say 0 rating to 1500 because you get the basic cap even if you don't ever do arenas. Aside from that, anyone interested in doing arena's already knows about this so why bother posting it.<br />

<br />
I´m kinda with you. They are stuck in the ´middle´right now. You can´t really just ´fly´to 85.. it still takes a few days of playing.... but at the same time, questing, and especially dungeons are so easy that it isn´t enjoyable any more (especially 60-80).. they have made it so that it is annoying enough for people who have many 85s.. yet so easy that even newer players don´t feel any type of challenge while leveling... nobody is really happy.<br />
<br />
Boosting exp from heirlooms and from nerfing the requirements isn´t really the answer because it totally messes with zone flow.... which is the one thing they did right in the new zones (they tell a story)... but if you enter a zone with heirlooms and a guild, if you want to see the end of the story in that zone, you are probably doing gray quests.<br />
<br />
And GC fell for what so many devs and community managers also fell for.... He never realized that most of his forum conversations ended up being with the worst 1% of all players (personality wise).</div></div><hr />

<br />
He's now doing &quot;blog posts&quot; for them rather than posting on the boards. I think the reasoning Blizz gave was to let the &quot;CMs be CMs and let the devs focus on their... Deving&quot;. Or something to that extent.<br />
<br />
Anyways, I don't get the whole frothing-at-the-mouth thing for GC. Maybe I'm just an ignorant mass (-m), but it seems like when he WAS actively posting, people would bitch.

I think Blizzard is screwed in the leveling department. If they make it more engaging and slow, then people complain as they try to level up alts to help their guild (e.g.: &quot;We need a hunter. Can a DPS reroll hunter to balance out our group?&quot; or &quot;Can anybody level another tank?&quot; and so forth). In those cases people want to zerg to 85.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, other people are bored at 85 and roll an alt to enjoy the low level experience and want to see all the new storylines and do all the quests. However, levels fly by too quickly and they end up possibly doing grey quests and outlevel zones too quickly.<br />
<br />
Maybe an easy solution would be to add a 3rd option to the XP NPCs. Right now you can have XP or turn it off for 10g by talking to a faction-specific NPC. Perhaps add a 3rd option that rewards half the XP from quests which doubles the gold reward (or however gold inversely scales with XP). Basically a middle-of-the-road switch that slows down the leveling experience, but also rewards more gold/silver along the way.</div></div><hr />

Maybe if someone didn't start with a snarky world 5th or 6th comment in the first place eh? Why did you choose to pick on the US poster instead of the EU poster?

The cap is based on what rating you achieved for the previous week. I'm going to guess that Blizzard is treating your inactive rating for the week as a 0, hence the 1343 cap again.</div></div><hr />

Funny, I used to be all peppy to get to Outlands because it was a huge improvement (in my opinion) leveling-wise.

<br />
agreed. Outlands zones were all amazing. And had great music too. Cata music with exception of nightsong and a couple others, has been abymsal. I have to turn music off in zones like deepholm and vashjir cause honestly, what terrible music. Hyjal is ok but not up to the quality of any northrend or outland zone music felt. Tol Barad, battleground music, really? especially someone who likes to play with looping music, a short 1min BG track looping is simply not good atmosphere for doing dailies vs the amazing tracks i had doing icecrown dailies, or quel danas dailies in BC .<br />
<br />
Only 5 actual new content zones to quest in vs northrends 8, or outlands 7. Granted they revamped old world but i still completed all of old world 1-60 and the 5 new zones in less time then it took me to do northrend or outlands. I realize that reworking a lot of old content deminished time that could be spent on new zones so that's to be expected though. I do hope next expansion, which won't have to overhaul half the game, will be able to throw in a much larger new area.</div></div><hr />

It's so funny because it's true. It isn't just ret pallies though. If you get over 2k there are going to be comps you will want to be. You can pretty much play anything to 1500-1800. 1800-2200 you can still do it, but it's going to be really tough. 2200+ there is a reason almost every team is one of a few select few. <br />
<br />
People can preach all day about skill&gt;everything, but as someone that loves pvp and arena I can tell you that isn't the case. In some comps I've beat people that I really thought were better based on nothing but my class being OP or my comp. This isn't something that can even be addressed though. Every season there are certain classes that are just OP, then there are comps of those OP classes that will rofl stomp people. I'm not saying skill isn't part the equation, it is. If you take a complete keyboard turning, clicking noob team that is an op class/comp versus a skilled team that is mediocre class/comp the skilled team will win. The problem comes in when you take a medium skilled team that's made of an op class/comp they are going to faceroll people that are better but simply not the current favorites.</div></div><hr />

Why? Because it might ACTUALLY increase the difficulty? The blue poster has a point, its just no one wants to make their own challenges and instead cry to blizzard to make it harder for them.<br />
<br />
As for the outlands thing, it was and will always be the WORST expansion for leveling. I have never hated a zone as much as I do outlands. I end up PVPing my way through to 68 which is sad because I hate pvp. Yet it is the lesser of the two evils.</div></div><hr />

There were also only 5 new levels to be gained, not 10, so I think the xpac necessarily warranted 7 or 8 zones. Having to rig around with a couple more zones would have been a bit annoying in my opinion.<br />

<br />
Actually, it is pretty accurate. If you want a challenge, then don't use BoA gear and the like. Don't out-gear an area and then whine and cry that it's too easy. Also, it becomes easier when you know what to expect in an area and/or the class you are playing. <br />
<br />
The content is designed for newer players who don't know the area and who aren't in amazing gear or being run by those that are. So, if you want a challenge, then YOU should add a challenge to yourself if you find it too easy for your gear/knowledge.</div></div><hr />
