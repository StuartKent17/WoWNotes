I got in as fast as I could, and I didn't get tickets. 4k or so in queue. Tickets were not sold out in 30 minutes, that's how long it took people to buy them in the Queue system. Tickets were gone in under half a second.</div></div><hr />

No way. I spammed f5 and when it came up, I quickly change quanity of 1 to 2 and clicked go. took me probably about .5 seconds. And I didn't get tickets.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This time I had IE open up on one monitor, Firefox on the other monitor. Then I spammed F5 on each one as fast as I could and I was 3000th in line when it came up. I managed to get tickets this time :D<br />
<br />
I had a friend that was 100 behind me in the queue. He got to the checkout, realized he had to have a battlenet account, merged them, then had an error during checkout. Tickets were sold out at that point. About 5 minutes later he tried the process again (because you get 15 minutes) and it worked and he got his ticket ???</div></div><hr />

Oh, I'm pretty sure they don't as I've never been in the US before and even in my country, you don't take someone's fingerprints under the assumption that you're a potential terrorist even though you appear to be of the caucasian type and of christian believe. But enough offtopic. ^^<br />
<br />
btt. would be nice to know, if any &quot;real&quot; fan managed to get his ticket(s) or was it just those ebay fags again hoping for lotsa ca$h to rip off?</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes, they need to do this. I'd pay $500 to Blizzard for a guaranteed ticket. I'm not paying $500 to a random on eBay for a maybe ticket if Blizz doesn't catch them scalping and screw me out of my $500 (the scalper won't be screwed, he'll pocket the cash and say lulz sry kthxbye).<br />
<br />
Sadly this is my one year in 7 with a possibility of long distance travel (work only gives me a nice chunk of time off once every 7 years; I'm not using one of my only two vacation weeks other years on Blizzcon). Here's hoping for a ticket in 2016! :)</div></div><hr />

WOOOO :D<br />
<br />
@10:00:10am, the queue was up to 10K+, so you can technically say that the tickets were sold out (reserved) in ~5-6 seconds, since 15 minutes is just the wait to buy them.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because it's blizzards fault and this doesn't happen anywhere else for any other event. There is no way to prevent scalping, it's not illegal in california. Majority of the tickets goto actual fans, only a small percentage get scalped. Forums are usually used for complaining so everything looks negative as all you are seeing is the darker side of situations. They can't check IDs at the door as it would then take hours to get in, if you didn't camp out overnight you probably wouldn't get inside until mid afternoon, and it's a family even, 13 year olds don't always have an ID. If people didn't buy scalped tickets there would be no market for it. <br />
<br />
And yes I bought 4 tickets for me and my family, I was 1,200 in queue...another guildie was 1,800 and the other was at 2,100ish. So myself and 2 other people I know, spread around the states all got in and got our tickets. With 11 million customers and only 20k tickets, some people are going to be left out...just because they sell fast doesn't mean it's all scalpers...You remember what you were doing? You were up early spamming refresh waiting for the tickets to come up? Well so were 30-50k other people...Even scalpers had to deal with the same system and lightning fast clicking/refreshing that everyone else had to.</div></div><hr />
