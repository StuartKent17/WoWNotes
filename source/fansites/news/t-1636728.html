Message from J. Allen Brack<br />
WoW Community: <br />
<br />
I know how much everyone was looking forward to this expansion, and once you were able to get in and start having fun, all the comments I've seen indicate that this is one of our best yet. But the quality of the content does not excuse the subpar launch experience we delivered, and I apologize for that.<br />
<br />
The first two days of the expansion were not a great experience, with many of you facing high queues or significant gameplay problems. We worked around the clock to tackle the demand issues and technical challenges, and fortunately things started looking better on Saturday. While millions of you were able to get in and play over the weekend, with many already reaching level 100, others still ran into very lengthy queues, particularly on the highest-population realms.<br />
<br />
To help address this, we’ve expanded the new instancing tech we used to improve queues on Saturday and we’re continuing the process of applying that to raise the capacity of all realms again. This will result in approximately double the prelaunch capacity on each realm, which should greatly reduce queue times for most realms if not eliminate queues altogether.<br />
<br />
In recognition of the difficulties so many of you ran into when trying to play over the first few days, we're adding five days’ worth of extra time to every subscription in the Americas, Oceania, and Europe that was active as of Friday, November 14. Things are already in a much better place than they were going into the weekend, so I hope you’ll now be able to focus on having a ton of fun with this expansion.<br />
<br />
I also hope you'll accept my apology and keep your faith in us. The support voiced by many of you as we worked through the challenges was immensely appreciated. We're extremely grateful to be part of such a passionate community. We love World of Warcraft, and we're very proud of this expansion, so stumbling out of the gates like this was very disappointing for all of us.<br />
<br />
On behalf of the World of Warcraft development team, as well as everyone at Blizzard, thank you all again for your patience and understanding.<br />
<br />
See you in Draenor.<br />
<br />
Sincerely,<br />
J. Allen Brack <br />
Executive Producer, World of Warcraft<br />
<br />
<br />
6.0.3 Hotfixes: November 18<br />
Blizzard is working on (https://twitter.com/Rygarius/status/534911211284856832) a hotfix for Tier 2 Trading Posts not unlocking rep gains with Sha'tari Defense or Laughing Skull.<br />
Garrisons, Followers, and Outposts<br />
<br />
Fishing Shack: The building should now correctly still provide a bonus while it's under construction.<br />
Frostwall Mine: Fixed a number of True Iron Deposits that were spawning inside of pillars and terrain.<br />
Mage Tower/Spirit Lodge: Characters under a shapeshifting effect should now be able to use an Ogre Waygate to return to their Garrisons.<br />
Outpost, Nagrand: The building bonus for having a Corral should no longer incorrectly dismount Herbalists while harvesting resource nodes.<br />
[Requires a realm restart.] Outpost, Spires of Arak: Bonus for the building should now switch correctly when changing buildings for the outpost.<br />
Salvage Yard: The building should now correctly still provide a bonus while it's under construction.<br />
Followers<br />
<br />
Followers that are 3 or more levels below the mission level now receive 10% of the mission XP and bonus XP (up from 0%). Additional information on how Followers and mission level affects their XP gain can be found in a forum thread titled Followers and Garrison Missions XP.<br />
<br />

<br />
Balance<br />
<br />
Empowered Moonkin's clearcasting effect should no longer be incorrectly consumed if it's triggered while the Moonkin is in the middle of casting a spell.<br />
<br />

Comet Storm should now correctly belong to the Frost school and is no longer usable if that school is locked.<br />

<br />
Talents<br />
<br />
[Requires a realm restart.] Holy Shield should now correctly deal damage when blocking normal attacks as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Bonus Objective: The Forgotten Caves: Gorg the Host should no longer be getting stuck in evade mode.<br />
Bonus Objective: The Howling Crag: Further increased the spawn rates of Pale Orcs and Rylak Eggs.<br />
For the Children!: Manastorm's Duplicator should now be correctly awarded to characters that complete the quest.<br />
Moving In: Characters that abandon the quest should now have an easier time reacquiring the quest and resume their progress on the main quest line.<br />
Ogre Diplomacy: Players that have completed Into the Heart of Madness should no longer sometimes be placed into an incorrect phase and be unable to complete the quest.<br />
Safety Measures: Increased the spawn rate of bog denizens.<br />
Shadowmoon Invasion! is now automatically removed from the character's quest log if they upgrade to a Tier 3 Garrison as this quest is only available for Tier 2 Garrisons.<br />
Skimming Off The Top: Increased the drop rates for Volatile Oil.<br />
Strike While the Iron is Hot: Blocked off the entrance to the Iron Docks so players won't accidentally wander out of the quest area and wind up getting lost.<br />
The Defense of Karabor: Players resurrecting at a graveyard during this quest should no longer be immediately attacked by Iron Horde NPCs.<br />
The Iron Wolf: Players should now be able to receive completion credit if they've died and released during the quest.<br />
Thunderlord Invasion!: The quest is now automatically removed from the character's quest log if they upgrade to a Tier 3 Garrison as this quest is only available for Tier 2 Garrisons.<br />
<br />
<br />
Creatures and NPCs<br />
<br />
Apexis Traders Dawn-Seeker Krek (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/86391-dawn-seeker-krek) (Alliance) and Dawn-Seeker Alkset (http://www.wowdb.com/npcs/86382-dawn-seeker-alkset) (Horde) are now offering Exceptional gear (item level 645 (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=645&amp;filter-ilvl-max=645&amp;filter-source=16384)) for sale.<br />
<br />
Developer Commentary: The vendors' offerings were previously tied to the Highmaul raid unlock, but we wanted to make sure that players have useful items to spend their Apexis Crystals on, rather than positioning them exclusively as a catch-up item vendor. The final tier of Flawless gear (item level 655 (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-ilvl-min=655&amp;filter-ilvl-max=655&amp;filter-source=16384)) will now unlock when the Highmaul raid becomes available, rather than when Blackrock Foundry becomes available.<br />
<br />
Increased the spawn rates for creatures and NPCs in the Skettis Ruins area in Spires of Arak. [Requires a realm restart.] Additionally, resolved an issue where some creatures were incorrectly sharing loot with other players.<br />
Grizzled Frostwolf Veteran's icon should no longer persist on the mini map after being defeated.<br />
Rangari Jonaa now has a cooldown on their Scatter Shot ability.<br />
Rotcap's icon should no longer persist on the mini map after being defeated.<br />
Typhon's icon should no longer persist on the mini map after being defeated.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dungeons, Raids, and Scenarios<br />
<br />
Characters with Warlords PvP gear that had its secondary item level activated due to being in PvP combat temporarily disqualifies them from queuing for Dungeons and Raid Finder. It can take up to 20 seconds after ending PvP combat before the character will be eligible to queue up normally.<br />
Upper Blackrock Spire<br />
<br />
During the Commander Tharbek encounter, players should no longer be kept in a constant state of combat between waves.<br />
<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
<br />
Reverted a hotfix from October 15 that reduced all PvP damage by 25%.<br />
Gnomes are now able to increase their reputation with Wrynn's Vanguard.<br />
<br />
<br />
Items<br />
<br />
Coil of Sturdy Rope, a Horde quest item should no longer be incorrectly dropping for Alliance characters.<br />
Miner's Coffee movement speed buff should now stack correctly with other movement speed buffs.<br />
Solium Band (http://www.wowdb.com/items?filter-search=Solium+Band) rings can now be equipped at level 98 (down from level 100).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Legendary Ring Quest Line and Apexis Crystals<br />
Here to provide additional clarification on the hotfix note that went out yesterday, November 17.<br />
<br />
Quests<br />
<br />
Draenor's Secret Power: Completion of this quest is now required before being able to move onto the next step of the Legendary quest chain. For characters that skipped this quest, completion of this quest has also been made into a requirement before being eligible for the next upgrade.<br />
<br />
<br />
This means players that skipped the quest will still have to complete Draenor's Secret Power before being eligible for the next upgrade. That last part wasn't included until now cause I was tunnel visioning on hotfixes and glossed over the supplemental email for the change. Hope this clears any confusion up.</div></div><hr />

Pre-paid time is the same. As long your account is active, you count as a sub.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It hasn't been applied yet, if you have a game time card applied that counts as an active 'subscription', you'll just get 5 days added on to your available time when they apply the time credit.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Mauth</div><div class="date">2014-11-18, 07:54 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I personally appreciate it when a company can own up to their mistakes. Yeah, it sucked that there were issues. Hell, i got stuck on the Nagrand bugged questline personally, but Blizzard launches have always been a bit of a challenge due to their MASSIVE playerbase. <br />
<br />
Anyone who was surprised by the issues either hasn't been part of a blizzard launch before, or they simply don't pay attention. <br />
<br />
As bad as it was, they took responsibility, hooked everyone up with some comp time, and came right out and owned the issues like a proper company should. No beating around the bush, no ignoring it until it got resolved, no overwhelming silence with nothing to show for it. This is how a company can maintain proper PR and keep people coming back. I've only had a few experiences that have absolutely sold me on a company. <br />
<br />
Nu Yalk Pizza.<br />
Fantasy Flight Games.<br />
Blizzard Entertainment. <br />
<br />
I'd recommend these companies to anyone, and i've got good personal experiences to back up my opinion. <br />
<br />
Kudos!</div></div><hr />

Respect goes a long way for both the customer and business. Thank you for reaching out even though its been a rough week for all. Just talk to us more, that's all we really want. It gives us comfort, but most importantly makes us feel like we belong, that we're a participant.</div></div><hr />

Of course it won't be enough for them - they will accept nothing less than personal direct apology from Metzen and direct hard-line access to WoW's servers, because they are entitled little shits.</div></div><hr />

I wasn't expecting an ''apology'', but hey... Blizzard did it well this time I guess.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Keile</div><div class="date">2014-11-18, 08:00 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">My guess is the free game time will kick shortly.<br />
<br />
Honestly, five free days is more than I was expecting and I am thankful they went that extra mile. I figured we'd get two (since that's roughly how many days the MAJOR problems went on for). I do, however, greatly appreciate that he manned up and accepted that they dropped the ball for the launch.<br />
<br />
I accept their apology, Blizzard has been good to me over the years. One fuck up like this isn't enough to make me turn on them.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Korru</div><div class="date">2014-11-18, 08:01 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well gosh, thx for the apology and game time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Of course it won't be enough for them - they will accept nothing less than personal direct apology from Metzen and direct hard-line access to WoW's servers, because they are entitled little shits.<br />
<br />
Certainly better than drones who enjoy taking it up the ass from large businesses.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">fa3sr011</div><div class="date">2014-11-18, 08:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Apology Greatly Accepted!<br />
For those of us who had taken off work to power level and chew through what I believe is the best expansion to date the loss of game time due to outages was significantly disappointing. Once things stabilized and I was able to enjoy massive amounts of content and truly enjoy what WoD has to offer. 5 days is a perfect gift and I appreciate it because I know this comes at a great cost to the company as well given the number of users who will have been granted this time. I have a lot of faith in Blizzard and things like this reenforce that.</div></div><hr />

Although this shouldn't have happened at all, I'm glad they finally decided to upgrade the old servers and bring the game into 2014.<br />
<br />
The 5 days extra is fair and I'm glad they compensated us for the messy launch.<br />

This expansion is amazing and I'm glad we're all having fun together now!<br />

The fact that they're able to double the pre-launch capacity of every realm, within a few days no less, makes it seem like this was an issue that could have been prevented, at least partially. They've been doing this for 10 years now, sheer weight of experience alone means they have to have an idea of what will happen during a launch, yet they keep having the same problems (obviously the DDOS attack stuff is beyond their control, but that's only a part of the story). It's hard to imagine how they could still be this woefully underprepared, but unfortunately that just leaves it being a calculated risk that was deemed to be acceptable, which frankly isn't much better.</div></div><hr />

<br />
at $14.99 a month, and a month has on average 30 days (some 31...one 28...using 30 as a nice even number) 5 days of gametime equates to about $2.50 per person that they will not be receiving this month. That may not seem like a lot on a by person basis...but let us look at the bigger picture:<br />
<br />
$2.50 * 7,200,000 (estimate of WoWs current subscription base, based on the last quarter numbers) = $18,000,000 In lost subscription fees due to this incident.<br />

Are they actually giving the money back to people though? Or are they extending subscriptions by 5 days? The post says &quot;Adding five days’ worth of extra time to every subscription,&quot; which sounds like the latter. If they push back subscriptions by 5 days, as long as you keep paying monthly they aren't losing anything. It's only different if you make use of the LAST 5 days of your subscription, because those are the days you wouldn't have had otherwise. In practice, those last 5 days aren't worth nearly as much as the first few days of an expansion. I'd bet pretty much everyone would happily give up at least that much time at the end of their subscription for a clean launch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
That is still 5 days that you are not paying for. By pushing back the subscription renwal they are still not getting money for those 5 days.<br />
<br />
They lose money from this deal, as I stated above.<br />
<br />
Example: You are due to renew on the 1st of the month...now you renew on the 6th. You paid $14.99 for a month, then go 5 days where you technically aren't paying. Its the same as issuing a refund...without actually issuing the refund. Rather than simply give the money BACK they just added 5 days.<br />
<br />
Basically it is this: Blizzard put a value on a day. That value is $2.50. Now everyone is given 5 of those days for free, even if they are done by pushing back subscription dates.</div></div><hr />

You get 5 days of access that you don't have to pay for, but as a player who renews monthly that only matters at the end of your subscription, because the rest is continuous. And on the other side, for a company, there's a BIG difference between giving the money back to everyone (which would be really losing it) and delaying renewal fees by 5 days. Especially because plenty of people won't use any of those 5 days that were added to the end of their subscription at all, and even fewer will use them as much as they would have used the time right when the expansion launched.<br />
<br />
Like I said before, it's nice to have an apology and the game time is a fine gesture, but it doesn't answer why things were allowed to get this far out of hand if a fairly good solution (doubling the capacity of every server) was available. It only took a few days to implement, so what was preventing it from being handled before the launch?</div></div><hr />

There were software issues and hardware issues that had to be addressed. Yes, they could have addressed the hardware upgrades beforehand. Doubling server capacity wouldn't have helped anything on launch though, only made things even worse.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before the flames rain down on my post it should be noted that I myself took off of work Thursday/Friday for this release and was excited as all hell to play non-stop from launch until I went back to work Monday. I main on Mal'Ganis and didn't even get to play Saturday except for maybe an hour at night after sitting in queue all day.<br />
<br />
The launch obviously did not go the way Blizzard had intended and the servers could not support the exponential increase of users. Evidenced by a DDOS attack by the amount of its own playerbase! Anyway, the way Blizzard handled the days afterwards in terms of communication and what we call in IT &quot;putting out fires&quot; was nothing less than exceptional. And now they send out this letter and own up to their failures. I applaud them for this level of humility and showing a human side.</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a huge money hit to Blizz, though, when you think about it. 5 free days for everyone? That's $2.50 worth of time granted to every active account... times that by 7 million accounts and Blizz just lost $17.5 million dollars of potential income. That's a very high bet that your generosity will pay off in the long run.</div></div><hr />

Your logic is flawed. If you paid for a 60 days, you have now paid for 65 days at the same price. Period. What happens after those 65 days is irrelevant. Blizzard is still losing 5 days of subscription fees. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also just so everyone knows, if your account was ACTIVE on Friday (ie. you were able to login and be stuck in queues) you will get this bonus. The status of your subscription or whether you were on pre-paid time is irrelevant. It also has not been credited yet but I imagine will be in the coming few days if not later tonight.</div></div><hr />

Your game time was unable to be used (which you paid for), so they gave you equivalent (or close to equivalent) game time. That sounds close to a refund to me.</div></div><hr />

Garrisons is the instance servers that time out. And tbh, it aint that bad anymore in my opinion. Quest bugs will there always be at launch, aint much to do about them.<br />

Talk about ranting without actually having a single thing worth saying whilst also butchering the language with swears because you're very angry for some reason.<br />
<br />
Also, Pandaria WAS something new so I wouldn't expect them to try something like that ever again. Partly because people like yourself are so shallow that you make an expansion that's been about conflict and destruction with solid gameplay out to be about &quot;pandas&quot;. I remember a lot from MoP besides Pandaren.<br />

Game time is not even close to a refund.<br />
<br />
You have &quot;lost&quot; game time, 5 days of game time = 5 extra day when you don't have to pay to access the game. How is this not a refund? What would YOU consider a refund? That they pay you back 3 months worth of gametime + the cost of the expansion and still allow you access? Because I saw someone want that on the official forums. <br />
<br />
Please...this is a refund for what has been lost due to their problems. They're not also accounting for psychological scars in people that might just have taken the rage over being unable to play a bit too far.</div></div><hr />

They give out extra game time all the time. I remember when they launched ToCr and fucked up the servers somehow, they wound up giving out a day or two of free game time. They just don't announce it. THAT'S the proof this was one of the biggest fuck ups, the fact that they actually told people they were getting free game time instead of just tacking it on.</div></div><hr />

<br />
at $14.99 a month, and a month has on average 30 days (some 31...one 28...using 30 as a nice even number) 5 days of gametime equates to about $2.50 per person that they will not be receiving this month. That may not seem like a lot on a by person basis...but let us look at the bigger picture:<br />
<br />
$2.50 * 7,200,000 (estimate of WoWs current subscription base, based on the last quarter numbers) = $18,000,000 In lost subscription fees due to this incident.<br />
<br />
Assuming I dun did mah maffs right......<br />
<br />
Nope your maffs aren't right. Not every subscription is anything like $15 a month.</div></div><hr />

I'll take corporate respect anyway I can get it. As someone who deals with companies, their insurers and legal departments anything you get from a company after their own failures without having to seek legal recourse, spend days on the phone and waiting weeks, this is pretty good. Mind you great would have been never having the issues, but a response and something, while nominal, is better than nothing especially for doing nothing. Trust me they could have easily done nothing and only given the exact time frame of the loss to someone who waited with Customer Service for days and days.

I've never had issues with any of World of Warcraft's expansion launches, this was the first time and fortunately it was just a 6 hour wait for the servers to go back online after the apparent DDOS attack, and a bit of lag before they went offline. I was very happy to find Alleria-Khadgar do not have queue times, and have not had queue times since Wrath/TBC days.<br />
<br />
That said, I was still able to make 100 on the second day and less than 32 hours after launch, it felt good to be among the first to run dungeons and heroics well before the pack.</div></div><hr />

It is a pity, as this has been without doubt probably the best levelling experience I've had, the dungeons I've experienced so far are fantastic, the garrison is a brilliant addition and going through this expansion with all my friends abck playing throws me back to earlier expansions.<br />
<br />
I'm playing since alpha, and WOTLK has easily been my favourite expansion, with a great sotry, raids and levelling experience along with the social connections and guild I joined, and remain with today. WoD has rekindled some of that fire that was dieing in Cata,, and nearly extinguished in MOP. <br />
<br />
Granted I'm a bit pee'd at been so far behin where I'd planned (I have my main at 100 going through heroics but planned to have both main and alt 100 and geared) I somewhat expected launch day hiccups,and while I was furstrated with six hour queues, we need to look bigger picture here and towards what is shaping up to be a real return to form with this expansion</div></div><hr />

<br />
It took about 5 days to fix, so yeah, 5 days is sufficient compensation. There is nothing else owed here. Only to those that are self-entitled. The only thing that anybody missed was being able to access the servers for around 5 days. Unless you subscribe to the ambulance chaser theory that people are due pain and suffering, in which case, get the fuck out.</div></div><hr />

Obviously they didn't prepare for the launch as they should have. I think the complaining from the player base was a little over the top (though that goes on about every part of the game continuously, so no surprise), but I was also disappointed that none of the updates or comments from employees ever had an apologetic tone. Just a simple &quot;sorry for the inconvenience&quot; at the start of a post would've been nice. Not even fussed about the game time really.</div></div><hr />

I can only imagine the panic-levels in the data centers and Blizzard offices over the past few days. Despite the massive stress on their staff they managed to keep the community updated as well as could be expected, fixed the majority of the ingame and server issues (of course there are still plenty of smaller bugs to be squashed) and now they don't only come with an official apology, but also a 5 day compensation for the 4 days of not being able to play (properly). <br />

True, but people don't pay/unsubscribe in a daily system, so it still costs them about nothing haha.<br />

This sort of thing has been used by them to make money, even recently with many getting 1 week free. Drawing someone in for 1 month+ earns money, but extending players who were going to cancel in a given content slump for 5 days is about zero change.</div></div><hr />

No it's not, If I like someone I would want them to be happy. It's just human. A ton of companies don't act human, whilst Blizzard does. Calm your pants and just accept the apology, it was a perfect refund for the amount of time people couldn't play and any more would be crazy overcompensation for such a small amount of time unplayed. <br />
<br />
Can't appreciate it? That's great, it's your opinion, but at least accept this apology as something when most other places don't even send one.</div></div><hr />

And you seriously have entitlement issues if you want more than this. They owned up to their mistake and gave you five days of game time when they could have easily given you just one or two or even zero. What more do you want?

<br />
You see, this is the problem; claiming that anyone who believes that a certain level of service should be expected as a consumer is “an entitled little shit”.<br />
<br />
Entitled to get the service I paid for? Yes, you’re absolutely right I’m entitled to it. That’s not me being “a little shit”, it’s me being a responsible consumer. I honestly don’t understand (and I mean at all) where certain companies in the gaming industry have managed to get this halo from. They can literally bungle an entire game or expansion launch, and the forums light up with white knights telling everyone that it “was expected” or that those who complain “know nothing about how games are made”.<br />
<br />
Bollocks.<br />
<br />
I’m not paid to make the game work, or understand data transfers, server loads, hardware components, instancing tech or anything else that someone looks up on Wikipedia and cites as if they know what they’re talking about. I’m paying for the game, under the auspice that it will work. When it doesn’t, and for any reason you care to mention, the company concerned are letting me, as a consumer, down.<br />
<br />
THEY are to blame; it’s THEIR fault.<br />
<br />
It’s not mine for having an expectation that they should get their fucking shit in one sock before launching a sub-standard product. This is particularly true of a company who have 10 years and four expansions worth of experience to draw from, as well as the availability of incredible resources. The fact that these issues came up is an embarrassment for a design studio like Blizzard, and it’s almost as if they learned nothing at all from the Diablo 3 calamity that some people generously like to call a launch. The only thing more embarrassing than that is the people who seem to think it’s somehow mature to just accept this poor level of service and, worse, tell everyone else it’s the norm and that they should change their expectations.<br />
<br />
It’s just another example of the sheer weight of victim culture these days, where the innocent are treated like criminals and vice versa.<br />
<br />
A girl gets raped. It was her fault for dressing provocatively.<br />
<br />
A guy gets murdered in a taxi. It was his fault for not checking ID explicitly.<br />
<br />
Blizzard ruins a launch. It’s my fault for not being educated in server hardware.<br />
<br />
Seriously, the inhabitants of this planet have been given the greatest gift in history; instant access to information, from across the globe. I think it’s an absolute tragedy that so many of us have used this amazing boon to take complete leave of our senses, and absolve the causes of failure of all responsibility for their errors. It’s perverse. It’s the opposite of intelligent. It’s actually no more than indoctrinated and weak-minded compliance, masquerading as maturity. The fact that service continues to be poor is because you, and those like you, are all so happy to meekly roll over, get your belly scratched, and accept second best.<br />
<br />
As for five days game time, well, that’s a typical response from a company that knows the cost of everything and the value of nothing. Sure, I lost less than five days of playing time so I’m no more out of pocket than I would have been; what I can’t be reimbursed for is the chance to level up and play with my friends in an expansion we were all looking forward to. That opportunity is now gone for at least two years, and potentially forever depending on whether or not they’re still around for the next expansion.<br />
<br />
That experience, gentle readers, is priceless.<br />
<br />
A bit like the deluded type of thinking that tries to convince others that silently accepting second-rate service is somehow to be applauded.<br />
<br />
No. Not for me.</div></div><hr />

Ok.. first of all, Keep Calm &amp; Please Unsubscribe (they should make t-shirts with that).<br />
<br />
Second.. have you ever played other games ? Where it takes weeks, months for the bugs to be fixed and have a fluent and pleasant gaming experience ? It took ONLY 3 days for Blizzard to come up with something that works for almost everyone.<br />

<br />
I had taken a few days vacation to enjoy it, and i was probably one among many that were annoyed that i could not play thursday-sunday.<br />
<br />
I have been able to play through a lot of content now, and i absolutely love it. I think they made an excellent job with this expansion.<br />
<br />
A game dont have this many players, if its not good, World of Warcraft is a great game.<br />
<br />
So .... i am personally a bit tired of reading all the whining from &quot;spoiled consumers&quot; &quot;The game has bugs...whine&quot;, &quot;this questline is broken...whine&quot;, &quot;Im stuck in my Garrison ...whine&quot;.<br />
<br />
Blizzard have always worked hard to fix errors and make the gaming experience great, and im sure they will this time as well. People have absolutely zero patience these days, and expect everything is fixed within a day. <br />
<br />
There are a lot of Companies out there selling bad products with different kinds of errors, and you cant talk to many of these Companies, which dont even work to correct their errors or even giving refunds.<br />
<br />
So what do you really pay to get this kind of quality entertainment, well actually, not very much when you count the hours of entertainment you get.<br />
<br />
Having played blizzard games ever since the launch of Warcraft 1, when i was 12 years old i can only say:<br />
<br />
Thanks for your existence Blizzard, thanks for making great games and thanks through all of these years to have given me some great quality entertainment. You do make the world a better place to be for gamers around the World.</div></div><hr />

In the us in the other hand they delete threads in an instant to make retards belivie that everythings fine.<br />
<br />
Well be glad that you guys got your five day game time.<br />
<br />
I honestly have no clue what you're talking about, and your statement in the discussion. Are you happy with the game? Are you happy with the 5 free days game time? Are you playing the game at all?<br />
<br />
Your tekst does not make any sense to someone with my IQ.<br />
<br />
Edit: On a different note, I 100% agree with your post, Stormydawn :).</div></div><hr />

Obviously they didn't prepare for the launch as they should have. I think the complaining from the player base was a little over the top (though that goes on about every part of the game continuously, so no surprise), but I was also disappointed that none of the updates or comments from employees ever had an apologetic tone. Just a simple &quot;sorry for the inconvenience&quot; at the start of a post would've been nice. Not even fussed about the game time really.<br />
<br />
This +1. <br />
<br />
I wasn't expecting anything from them in terms of compensation so 5 days is more than enough of a gesture. The biggest thing for me was their lack of an apology and in fact, the tone of a lot of their messages was almost passive aggressive, yes they were busy fixing the errors and that was more important that sitting there on twitter sending out apologies to everyone but what they seemed to forget was that the failure of launch night was caused by their lack of preparation not by us players, so giving out attitude didn't help calm the players, especially the people who took time of work &amp; stayed up all night just to be faced with the loading screen on death, or 2 days later, a 3500 queue for Boulderfist EU......!<br />
<br />
They have apologised now which I think speaks volumes, the free game time is also a lovely gesture. Fingers crossed we get more stability with every reset!</div></div><hr />

Pleasantly surprised.<br />
<br />
Terrible revievs on official game sites , mass exeodus of players due to sub cancelation and demanding refunds , terrible service fo EU server force this kind of actions - its not longer 2006 when news about games were coming out with a month delay in computer magzines - thx to social media (and i dont mean kiss-ass podcasts only real independent sites) if game launch is failed people know it imiadiately on day 2 of release and simply dont waste money on something what not working - thats why even blizzard had to bend and instal new hardware and beg on knees so people dont leave their 10 years old game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Second.. have you ever played other games ? Where it takes weeks, months for the bugs to be fixed and have a fluent and pleasant gaming experience ? It took ONLY 3 days for Blizzard to come up with something that works for almost everyone.<br />
<br />
You Sir should look up the definitions of &quot;patience&quot; and &quot;tolerance&quot;.<br />
<br />
I’m calm, and I unsubscribed. I do like the idea of the t-shirt, though, so leave it with me.<br />
<br />
Yes, of course I’ve played other games. Many, many, many of them. Most of my time is currently with SW:TOR as I’m preparing for the expansion, actually. But how is this relevant? We should just accept Blizzard launches being shit because other launches are… More shit?<br />
<br />
No. It’s not acceptable for any studio and, quite honestly, Blizzard should be embarrassed that they made a bungle of something that they’ve had 10 years and four prior launches of experience to draw on. Hell, they even release pre-patches to stop significant issues – before launching new content with significant issues.<br />
<br />
I’ll look up patience and tolerance, you look up meek compliance. If I took you out to dinner to a steak house, and we were both served shit sandwiches, I’d kick off and demand my fucking steak; all the while, you’d sit and argue that I should pipe down because at least the restaurant was good enough to feed us at all.<br />
<br />
I’m telling you something right now. If Blizzard hadn’t learned that players are easy to manipulate into acceptance of mediocrity (and that they have a team of white knight sheep to do it for them), and instead learned that they kick up a real stink when service isn’t acceptable, these problems would go away completely.<br />
<br />
Pinky swear.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Revak</div><div class="date">2014-11-19, 02:27 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Good move by Blizz on the 5-free days. But honestly, it's just PR. If they really wanted to make a splash and show they really mean it they would have done a free-month so people noticed that they didn't have a recurring payment. But 5 days is 5 days and I'll take it.<br />
<br />
Now the rings, that's not such a good move. They should have just let it stay the way it is and let everyone get it before turning in the crystals since so many that were able to play over the weekend got the 680 version. Now they are just making those who didn't get to play d/t issues with Blizz servers do even more work for them. Do the people that have the 680 versions have to still get it done before 6.1? Yes, of course. But they have plenty of time and will be in raid gear and not needing those crystals as much by then so they'll add up. Those who do not have the 680 version were not only at a disadvantage from not getting to play over the launch weekend, but now also having to spend a ton of crystals to upgrade the ring to catch up. All the while the others are getting to spend crystals on other gear for raiding that starts in several weeks. Of course you can group up with guildies, group finder, etc. and grind out crystals and catch up. But IMO you shouldn't have to. Just let everyone get the 680's now after completing heroics. NOTE: I have my 680 and this is my opinion on the situation<br />
<br />
<br />
All in all I thought the launch was terrible, worst one yet. But now that servers are stabilizing I'm enjoying the game. Though I have a love/hate relationship with Garrisons at the moment :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I like your idea of the steak house, but I think you misused it. Here is my version of the story. <br />
<br />
The restaurant is launching a new incredible BBQ sauce that the Chef had in mind for weeks. We go there for the launch and both order juicy steaks with that sauce, but unfortunately the Chef has a heart attack, or anything similar that prevents him from making his secret BBQ sauce, and nobody else in there knows the recipe. What can they do but give us the normal steak sauce and apologies ?<br />
<br />
Sure, the Chef should have made health check-ups 'cause he was getting old, and he should have written the recipe down somewhere. But who could have predicted that he was gonna have a heart attack ? Just. No. One.<br />
<br />
Sure, we are gonna be disappointed because we wanted to try the new thing so badly. Then why don't we come back after a few days when the Chef is back with some medicines, and is able to prepare his incredible sauce again ? That's why I would call patience and tolerance.<br />
<br />
See the analogy here ? :)<br />
<br />
I don't want you to change your mind (well, I'd hope to, but hey), I want you to understand my point of view, that's it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Okay let me explain it better:<br />
<br />
Some nolifers gave Blizzard money to access the servers. They propably also had to say something positive about it while laughing at other players qqing in the forums.<br />
<br />
Did you also know there is a hidden section in the official forum just for these nolifers to discuss the game? They pretty much spits on their playerbase.<br />
<br />
Do you think im talking bullshit? Propably because you have faith on this company.<br />
<br />
I did not even play WoD. I got it preordered. I only did ERP tho. Pvp is a big failure. Even Smash Bros 4 pvp is much more balanced and i play Ganondorf. Maybe WoD pvp will be fun again. Maybe then i will play it.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">notorious98</div><div class="date">2014-11-19, 05:29 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">No it's not, If I like someone I would want them to be happy. It's just human. A ton of companies don't act human, whilst Blizzard does. Calm your pants and just accept the apology, it was a perfect refund for the amount of time people couldn't play and any more would be crazy overcompensation for such a small amount of time unplayed. <br />
<br />
Can't appreciate it? That's great, it's your opinion, but at least accept this apology as something when most other places don't even send one.<br />
<br />
First of all, you're wrong. You can dislike somebody and still want to make them happy. Why? Because it benefits you. For example, as a manager, you could seriously dislike an employee but want to make them happy because they are awesome at what they do and they make you money. Same thing goes for customers. You can dislike customers and still want to make them happy because, once again, they make you money. The problem is that you're assuming they like you and, because of that, they want to make you happy when it doesn't go there. You're their customer and you make them money, so they want to make you happy. Whether they like you or not doesn't make a shit of difference.<br />
<br />
Second, I don't play the game so I don't give a shit if they apologize or not. I already said that nobody was owed anything more than 5 days. However, I also said that it was just adequate. And anything more most certainly wouldn't be &quot;crazy overcompensation&quot;. As a former manager at Domino's Pizza, when we pissed off a customer, we didn't just refund them their money. We typically also gave them another pizza or something else for free. Going above and beyond is how businesses thrive. The fact that you don't understand that tells me that you don't know shit about how to run a business.</div></div><hr />

No that's not what I mean, subs in Asia only pay only a fraction of the sub price overall.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You can't please everyone, you being a manager should know this most of all. As you can see most people thought this was a adequate response from Blizzard besides a select few. To me, that's a great success PR stunt or not. <br />
<br />
To compare your pizza to Blizzard's subscription service isn't the best comparison. You can have one bad pizza and think your meal is ruined, most people don't consider a couple bad days worth an entire month of service, including Blizzard. Some people do, but, like I said, you can't please everyone. There is always that one guy who thinks one pizza isn't enough.<br />
<br />
You had 3 out of 30 days supposedly ruined, that's like having one bad bite from an otherwise amazing pizza. Sure you would get a refunded Pizza for that one bite maybe, but to Blizzard the 5 days of refunded time is considered their free pizza. Every business and customer sees the products at different values, you can't compare two different businesses to each other and say Blizzard should have done better when their personal and financial values are different.<br />
<br />
EDIT : Also, keep in mind some people didn't even have any issues playing, would it be smart to give them a free month for having no troubles at all? This was a much larger audience, so using your analogy if Blizzard gave everyone a free month or free pet it is equal to giving 7 million people one free pizza when some of those people had no issues with their pizza at all, It really isn't the smartest business decision, &quot;Mr. Manager&quot;.<br />
<br />
EDIT EDIT : Lastly, all this pizza talk is making me hungry, curse you.</div></div><hr />
