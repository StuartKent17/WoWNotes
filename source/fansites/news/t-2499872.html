A new content update for World of Warcraft is in development and will soon be available on the Public Test Realms (PTR). While not all features will be fully functional and available for testing, here’s a look at some of the new content coming in this version.<br />
<br />
Worgen and Goblin Character Model Updates<br />
First introduced in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, worgen and goblins are getting a long-anticipated suite of visual improvements to their character models. These updates include every aspect of how the worgen and goblins look—from their faces to their animations.<br />
<br />
Celebrate 15 Years of World of Warcraft<br />
This November marks the 15th anniversary of World of Warcraft, and we have some special things planned to celebrate the occasion. Players who log in during the event period will receive a celebration package in the mail with a Lil’ Nefarian pet and some other in-game goodies. Throughout the duration of the event, you’ll be able to participate in three unique raids with iconic encounters from past expansions along with an old-school-inspired Alterac Valley battleground. Players who defeat all nine bosses in the raid wings will receive the Obsidian Worldbreaker, a Black Dragonflight mount inspired by Deathwing. Players who participate in Alterac Valley will receive a new anniversary event currency which can be exchanged for two new mounts: the Stormpike Battle Charger (Alliance) and the Frostwolf Snarler (Horde).<br />
<br />
A Fuzzy, Buzzy Mount<br />
Alliance players rejoice – Stormsong Valley beekeepers have figured out how to grow ‘em big enough to ride! Barry the Beekeeper has some quests for you, so you should talk to him to get started on this honey of an adventure.<br />
<br />
New Timewalking Raid: Firelands<br />
When Cataclysm Timewalking is active, max-level players will be able to form a raid group and enter the Sulfuron Spire once more. As with previous Timewalking raids (Black Temple, Ulduar), your gear and power are scaled to the challenge, and all the bosses and rewards you expect lie in wait.<br />
<br />
Introducing Party Sync<br />
During this PTR we’re experimenting with a new mode that makes it easier for players in a party to do quests and play together: Party Sync. When players activate Party Sync, everyone in the party becomes aligned to the same quest state, including phases. By mousing over a quest in your tracker, you can see who is on the quest, what their progress is, and who’s ready to turn in the quest. There’s something else we’re going to try out on the PTR, a “replay” quest feature. This will allow players who have already completed certain quests to replay those quests with their friends for rewards that are appropriate to their current level, regardless of the original level of the quest.<br />
We’re also relaxing level restrictions on queueing for instanced content with your friends. This allows lower-level players to queue for content in their level range, and higher-level players can choose to join them by having their level scaled down while they’re in the instance. This feature will be available for dungeon instances for PTR Week 1, with PvP instances being flagged in the following weeks. Please note that unlike Timewalking, when your level is scaled down via Party Sync you will temporarily lose access to abilities and powers (such as Azerite traits) with requirements that exceed your reduced level.<br />
<br />
Recruit A Friend Returns<br />
Coming in 8.2.5 is a revamped Recruit A Friend system. If you have active game time you’ll be able to recruit your friends—both brand-new to the game and returning champions—to share in your adventures. To do so, you’ll be able to use a new URL generation tool to create a custom link to give to your friends. By following the link, you’ll be connected to each other and will be able to see if they have purchased game time, resulting in rewards for you! For each month your recruits have active game time, you’ll earn a new reward such as unique pets, mounts, game time and more. These rewards unlock per month and scale with how many months your recruits have subscribed for. And, of course, with Party Sync you’ll be able to journey with your friends on any of your characters. We’ll have more information about Recruit A Friend rewards when we get closer to its release.<br />
<br />
Thanks for reading, and we’ll see you on the 8.2.5 PTR!2</div></div><hr />

If you enjoyed playing horde, you'll sure enjoy playing as alliance too to get all their &quot;exclusive&quot; faction content (that you can totally use as horde btw).</div></div><hr />

Horde have had loads of faction specific mounts, more than Alliance in BFA - just earn it on alliance and use it on horde, the same as alliance did for the horde ones</div></div><hr />

<br />
I feel like one person will need to have the quest, and they can basically share it to you, even if you've done it - then the issue there is they could just keep sharing it, and not complete it themselves, the simplest solution is just to reduce the xp/ gold you get from any quest every time you complete it</div></div><hr />

It has always been known to be an alliance mount. This information has been widely available, albeit not officially confirmed, for literally half a year. <br />

Yeah, I talking system wise. I expect those things to be on a new expansion, maybe a big patch, but never on .x.5.<br />

<br />
Of course it was. But remember that 8.2.5 is most likely late September/early October, and 8.3 won't come for another 2-3 months. Some continuation of story (which I fully expect despite no mention in blue post) and evergreen piece of content like Chromie scenario would be welcome.</div></div><hr />

<br />
honestly i wish they had picked dragon soul, cos mechanically at least it is the easier of the raids in cata, that being said though i doubt there's any classes left in game that have the burst dps needed for spine after all the pruning being done so likely one of the reasons they didn't choose that one, either way i'm gonna be laughing my ass off when all the threads start coming out cos ppl can't down shannox due to the mechanics of facerage and rageface, or can't wrap their heads around the turning ryolith mechanic, gonna be glorious.</div></div><hr />

Seriously. Wasn't patch 8.2 substantial enough? Christ, you guys are greedy.<br />
<br />
8.2 isn't enough content to last until 8.3. Consider that we'll have 2-3 months from the release of 8.2.5 until 8.3. So, 3-4 months from now, at least even if this patch is only on PTR for t a month and starts next week.<br />

You have a queue for leveling, where everyone can join, all levels and they are synced to the dg level and ALL dgs are avaliable. Max level players get currency to buy high end gear as a daily reward.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And you base that on what? Yourself not paying?<br />
<br />
Most people are either unable, or unwilling to churn out 200k gold monthly for sub. The only people who have lots of in game gold these days are those who played through WoD with an army of alts, those who are AH gods, and those who farm all day every day. Most of the people I know pay for the sub the old fashioned way, including myself.<br />
<br />
<br />
Shame that they will make Deathwing mount available so easily. It's such an awesome model, perhaps the best ever for a mount, yet everyone will be riding one, so it will lose it's prestige instantly.<br />
<br />
But 1-2 years after that it will become super prestige as it turns into a mount that you can't acquire anymore.</div></div><hr />

Oh lord, is this really how people think tokens work? Dude, just cause you're not paying doesn't mean no one is. For you to buy that token someone had to spend 20 dollars on it, 5 more then the sub fee.<br />
<br />
You buying tokens means Blizz made an extra 5 dollars off your sub.</div></div><hr />

It's a leveling dungeon queue, 1-49, 51-59, 61-69, 71-79, 50/60/70 has it's own queue, 24 man raids their own queue, 8 man raids their own queue, max level dungeons their own queue, the 2 lvl 50 8 man dungeons have their own queue, etc.<br />

<br />
It isn't.<br />
<br />
&quot;First introduced in World of Warcraft: Cataclysm, worgen and goblins are getting a long-anticipated suite of visual improvements to their character models. These updates include every aspect of how the worgen and goblins look—from their faces to their animations.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;This November marks the 15th anniversary of World of Warcraft, and we have some special things planned to celebrate the occasion. Players who log in during the event period will receive a celebration package in the mail with a Lil’ Nefarian pet and some other in-game goodies. Throughout the duration of the event, you’ll be able to participate in three unique raids with iconic encounters from past expansions along with an old-school-inspired Alterac Valley battleground.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;When Cataclysm Timewalking is active, max-level players will be able to form a raid group and enter the Sulfuron Spire once more. As with previous Timewalking raids (Black Temple, Ulduar), your gear and power are scaled to the challenge, and all the bosses and rewards you expect lie in wait.&quot;<br />
<br />
&quot;Alliance players rejoice – Stormsong Valley beekeepers have figured out how to grow ‘em big enough to ride! Barry the Beekeeper has some quests for you, so you should talk to him to get started on this honey of an adventure.&quot;<br />
<br />
This is all content - just because it might not be content you want doesn't invalidate that fact. Don't lie.<br />

Only thing I'm interested in is new Worgen and Goblin models.. did they mention heritage armor?<br />

Yeah, female Tauren are one of my favorite models and I can't stand the weird split lip muppet camel face they have going on now. Like, look at a real cow, please. Or in the case of mounts, a real horse, bear, hyena, rat, etc. It probably will be better than the current model, but wishing for new models is like wishing on a monkey's paw in the case of Blizzard, and will probably be weird in a new, different way.<br />
<br />
OT, I'm waiting to see Blizzcon news about 9.0 before I decide whether to come back and get the anniversary mount. Deathwing looks awesome, but there's no point in leveling up and suffering through BFA if I'm not playing the next one either.</div></div><hr />

OR maybe learn to read the entire post. &quot;here’s a look at SOME of the new content coming in this version.&quot;<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously the war campaign will continue, expect something similar to darkshore/arathi. Mulgore is looking like an easy guess given how 8.2 ended.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also Blizzard stated this months ago &quot;Goblin and Worgen fans will be pleased to hear that the long-awaited model update for each will be arriving in a future content patch.<br />

“Shortly after Rise of Azshara, you’ll see that,” Morgan explained. “These are the two races that haven’t been updated. They’ll have new heritage armor with that as well.”</div></div><hr />

This will allow players who have already completed certain quests to replay those quests with their friends for rewards that are appropriate to their current level, regardless of the original level of the quest<br />

I do hope that means that we'll see lower levels scaling to all levels in future AND reward level-appropriate. 7.3.5 was good, but zone scaling didn't go nearly far enough</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
Obviously the war campaign will continue, expect something similar to darkshore/arathi. Mulgore is looking like an easy guess given how 8.2 ended.<br />
<br />
<br />
Also Blizzard stated this months ago &quot;Goblin and Worgen fans will be pleased to hear that the long-awaited model update for each will be arriving in a future content patch.<br />
<br />
“Shortly after Rise of Azshara, you’ll see that,” Morgan explained. “These are the two races that haven’t been updated. They’ll have new heritage armor with that as well.”<br />
<br />
Model updates are not playable content. They're a feature. Features != playable content. <br />
<br />
I'm not disputing that 8.2.5 brings some nice *features*. But unless there's more, there's not a lot of *playable* content.</div></div><hr />

I'm assuming there will be more then just this. 8.2.5 isn't on ptr just yet.<br />

<br />
<br />
Of course it was. But remember that 8.2.5 is most likely late September/early October, and 8.3 won't come for another 2-3 months. Some continuation of story (which I fully expect despite no mention in blue post) and evergreen piece of content like Chromie scenario would be welcome.<br />

No shit. We’ve known what was going to be the main feature of this patch since last blizzcon i.e. Worgen and Goblin updates. It’s doubtful we’ll get any new ones in 8.3 either - if they’re going to give us any more it’ll be in 8.3.5 or 9.0. We’ll find out at Blizzcon regardless.</div></div><hr />

Kua'fon is not a drop and cannot be earned by Alliance. It is a quest reward from a quest chain and a series of dailies as Horde, but once earned, your Alliance characters on that account can use it.</div></div><hr />

This is really a now or never situation for goblin/worgen monks, any other time they were to enable them would really be in a new expansion where it would be expected of them to add a few other race/class combos many of which would make absolutely no sense and be purely to make up numbers, giving them now in the goblin worgen patch no one would blink an eye.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Nope. I said there won't be any new allied races in 8.2.5 long before. It's not a surprise they had to finish up worgen and goblin models. There is not time to make new allied races. I also strongly believe that there won't be any until at least next expansion preorder. For BfA Blizzard, in my opinion, is done with Allied Races, Kul Tirans and Zandalari make sense as the last ones in this expansion. We don't need new allied races every .5 patch, it would just bloat the number of races too much.</div></div><hr />

True but it doesn't say if there is a prerequisite maybe just maybe you have to have bumbles in order to trigger the quest but nobody knows until it goes on to the test realm and I understand how it reads however keep in mind they don't put everything in the notes heck even now people don't understand what blizzard beads when they post that s*** so yeah you might just have to talk to him to start a quest line cool or maybe you have to do the previous quest that had something to do with Abby already and being able to grow it so you don't have to worry about training in New be<br />

The feature was the new recruit a friend system which essentially you create a link and then the more that the other person plays the more game time they buy so on and so forth every month can unlock new rewards from free game time to exclusive pets or exclusive mounts similar to fortnite Creator code I guess but I don't know anything about fortnite because I'm not an autistic 12 year old</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hmm... What can get done in 4 months...<br />
<br />
- Flying<br />
- Raiding (AotC if you dont already have it)<br />
- Mythic + R.IO Score<br />
- Reputations<br />
- Mount Farming (Yes.... it is content... Stop kidding yourself.... Unless your Asmongold)<br />
- Classic Raids<br />
|<br />
V<br />
Classic WoW (for those who hate BfA with a fiery passion)<br />
- Firelands Timewalking (I can guarantee you Cata babies wont know wtf to do in Firelands)<br />
- Bee Mount (I guess this falls into Mount Farming?)<br />
- PVP Season 3 (Unless your bad at it)<br />
<br />
Sounds 4+ months worth right there.... Unless you are planning to play classic, and your not expecting the grind to 60 is harder than you think it may be.</div></div><hr />

Seems more interesting than 8.2 with Azshara raid, definitely staying subbed! I've yet to do TW BT or Ulduar, maybe I'll try FL.<br />

no new allied race<br />
<br />
&gt;_&gt;<br />
<br />
Yeah, equally bummed here. I want me some Vulpera or Mok'nathal.<br />

Nope. I said there won't be any new allied races in 8.2.5 long before. It's not a surprise they had to finish up worgen and goblin models. There is not time to make new allied races. I also strongly believe that there won't be any until at least next expansion preorder. For BfA Blizzard, in my opinion, is done with Allied Races, Kul Tirans and Zandalari make sense as the last ones in this expansion. We don't need new allied races every .5 patch, it would just bloat the number of races too much.<br />
<br />
That'd be pretty weird since there are like four total slots left to complete for allied races, two on horde and two on alliance. I think we can expect at least 2 new allied races for 8.3 and then the final two allied races for 9.0 pre-order.<br />
<br />
Mecha Gnomes and Vulpera for 8.3.<br />
??? and Mok'nathal for Horde 9.0?</div></div><hr />

<br />
- Flying<br />
<br />
Flying itself is a feature, not playable content (Jesus, people, learn the fucking difference...) but yes, you do content to get it However a) that content is out now and b) most people already have finished this or will soon.<br />
<br />
<br />
- Raiding (AotC if you dont already have it)<br />
<br />
My very casual guild clears N in one night now, is 3/8 H on the 2nd night. Once a few more people have seen N they'll clear out H. That won't take 4 months. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Mythic + R.IO Score<br />
<br />
This isn't new content. It's grinding old 5 mans to elevate some score. <br />
<br />
<br />
- Reputations<br />
<br />
1) reps aren't content. You DO content to raise them, but they're not content themselves. Oh and you mean the reps that are already at revered if you have flight like many people do? <br />
<br />
<br />
- Mount Farming (Yes.... it is content... Stop kidding yourself.... Unless your Asmongold)<br />
<br />
This is getting boring - it's not new content. You DO content do get he mounts, but repeated something over and over isn't new content. And if you're talking mounts from 8.1 and before it's NOT NEW 8.2 CONTENT. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />

Speaking of things that are NOT NEW 8.2 CONTENT....<br />
<br />
Sure people can be completionists and do things like 'get every mount' or 'raise all reps to exalted' but those aren't new playable content, they're doing things you have access to now over and over to raise a score.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So bascially what your saying is, its not content because you find it boring? .... Okay.<br />
<br />
Do what you want in the so called &quot;content-less&quot; game.</div></div><hr />
