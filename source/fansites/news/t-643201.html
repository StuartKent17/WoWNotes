Not really, likely the ones with 3 green stats are from hard modes, while the others are randomly dropped, and thus &quot;meant to be&quot; less interesting.</div></div><hr />

OMG, did you see the stats??? More STR for tang gear and more STA for dps gear. Rediculous i think.</div></div><hr />

<br />
All four of those pieces are crafted 226 BOE pieces. The DPS pieces have more stamina than the Tanking pieces, and the Tanking pieces have more STR then the DPS pieces.<br />
<br />
Not itemized very well is an understatement.</div></div><hr />

So far only that one picture has implied that Worldcarver is no longer 120str/180sta where the rest of the internet says it still is. Is Worldcarver still 180 stam?</div></div><hr />

If you paid attention, you'd realize this list is far from complete; it's only the PTR data and bosses like Algalon and Yoggy haven't been tested yet, so calm thyself. As your name suggests, you're a PvPer, so why do you care so much?</div></div><hr />

Usually they announce it WITH confirming that the patch will come 1 week before the actualy release. Next to that they shut down the test servers 1 week ahead of the release aswell.<br />
<br />
Why don't they do it this time? I like many others on my realm needed just 1 more week to get the plagued proto-drake. And I had some other things in mind that I wanted /needed to get done before the actual release. <br />
<br />
From one side I am very happy with the patch coming, but on the other I am not looking forward to it as it is just so sudden ...as in couldn't prepare on the actualy release.<br />
<br />
Lets hope (that according to the Blizzard emplyoee) that the 5 remaining % of the &quot;unconfirmed part&quot; is really the truth and we get 1 more week. <br />
<br />
This just isn't the way Blizzard usually announces stuff. Is it really showing that there is a new head in charge?</div></div><hr />

Uh dude, you have known for weeks that the plagued proto-drake would be removed from being a possibility to get if you have been following blue posts. Also as far as the loot list, we have a pretty detailed one on a % of the loot, to me the rest can stay a mistery because well who needs the game spoiled completely before its made live. imo get over it and get used to it, thats life.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Devzero</div><div class="date">2009-04-15, 04:05 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">First off, I appreciate the work you have put in to harvest item data from WoW. Maybe I have just been spoiled by seeing all of the new loot before a big patch hits, but I am curious why stats for all of the drops(including the new legendary*mmmm*) have not been posted yet. It is because the patch was not final until last night, and you nobody has had time to harvest data yet? I need more data to get me drooling over the new things I MUST have. :)</div></div><hr />
