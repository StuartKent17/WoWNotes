Reminder: Firelands Raid Changes Incoming<br />
Don't forget about the nerfs that go in to effect this week!<br />
With the final showdown against Deathwing approaching, we’ve been keeping a close eye on players' progress through the current Firelands raid content. Before patch 4.3 is released, we want groups who are working on Heroic-difficulty content to be able to get as close to Ragnaros as possible, and we want players who are tackling normal progression to be able to experience as many of the encounters as they can. To achieve these goals, we’ll be toning down the difficulty of both normal and Heroic raids through hotfixes in the coming weeks. In general, we plan to reduce health and damage of all raid bosses in both normal and Heroic Firelands by around the same percentage we brought difficulty down for the original Cataclysm raids when Rage of the Firelands (patch 4.2) was released.<br />
<br />
We're looking forward to seeing more groups of players face off against the Fire Lord in the weeks ahead. However, before we make these changes, we want to give everyone a final shot at the bosses at their current difficulty level -- so this is a heads up that we’re planning to apply the difficulty hotfixes beginning the week of September 19.<br />
<br />
Stay tuned to the Patch 4.2 Hotfixes blog for these and other live updates to the game as they happen.<br />

Agreed. Back in Wrath, my guild and I took down all the normal-mode bosses except Yogg-Saron when they were current content. I don't feel welcome in current-tier content in Cataclysm.</div></div><hr />

It was the time when 2 full teams were working on the game - one doing Expansion and another helping with it + imrpoving orginal game. Now there is just one half compitent team there - full of interns ... that are simply not good enough handeling and taking the game forward. Its showing on every front - including the lack of news coming forward. <br />
<br />
PPL have said it here before. Cata has failed simply because it did not build a bridge between leveling, the 5 man content and the raiding. Its really a joke to see how Blizzard has done their balancing in this expansion. Instead of building a solid experienced based on gratual improving players and raids... they just took a piss on the entire experience from start to finish. If they want ppl to enjoy see the content - they should change the raids to 5 man instances instead of nering them to the ground.</div></div><hr />

I mean they've already nerfed 50m hp off him which made phase 3 a joke and phase 4 take way less time. Its going to be so satisfying for the guilds that kill this after the nerf &quot;YEEEEAAAHHHHH WE DID IT, too bad we did it with a 40% hp nerf, it just doesn't feel...satisfying...&quot;</div></div><hr />

Also, what do they think this trend is going to lead to? Do they think lowering the bar now will get people trained for Deathwing? It's just setting a lower bar for an already easy instance (normal).<br />

I play with a bunch of morons (&lt;3 being anonymous here). One of our Warrior tanks gems full Avoidance. Our Paladin tank wears a few DPS pieces.

My bet on hc nerf , they noticed the big geargap between guilds that allready did hc's in t11 and the guilds that didn't , the first grp blasted thru firelands normal while the 2nd struggled , they want to avoid that for the final raid.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Interesting point.<br />
<br />
Although, truth be told, I was under the assumption that most of the Guilds that full-cleared FL normal week 1 were the guilds doing the fights on the PTR.</div></div><hr />

They've fucked up the leveling curve&gt;heroics&gt;raids&gt;heroic raids so bad this ex-pac they need to be turfed. <br />
Give raiders their hard modes Blizz, but next time don't forget the rest of your fucking subscribers until 6-10 months after an expac release.<br />
<br />
<br />
edit: formatting.<br />
<br />
It was correct at the begining... then they started to nerf the crap out of the normal and heroic dungeons... totally destroying the progression between dungeons and normal raiding...<br />
<br />
Then proceded to nerf normal raiding... now they need to nerf heroic raiding so it match (again) the progression curve...<br />
<br />
The only problem is that the game now is overall easier, not matter what dificult you play.<br />

well considering the kill rate of heroic ragnaros right now is 0.95% of all guilds in the world, and the rest besides Ryo and shannox are under 10%, I think blizzard realised they may have overtuned this tier a bit.<br />
<br />
Data from fansites? They don't have it all... wowprogress doesn't have all guilds for instance.<br />
<br />
Anyway, people now are totally blind to the fact that it's only 2 months in a 6 months (at least) patch.<br />
<br />
It was always like that, the kills increase as we go further into the life time of the patch. Only a really bad designed MMO game should be expected to be totally done by everyone in less than half of the patch's supposed life cycle.<br />
<br />
People forgot that:<br />
<br />
1) Firelands launched during holidays.<br />
2) Only 7 bosses, if you're hitting your head at Ragnaros now, you're progressing like you were only missing Al'akir or Cho'gal or Nefarian in T11. With that fewer bosses, it's supposed to have raids progression spread between 3/7-6/7 like it was in T11. Ppl checking this as &quot;I only have 6 bosses down this patch and had 11 in T11, dificult is wrong in T12&quot; need to re-evaluate something...<br />
3) It's only 2 months out of 6.<br />
<br />
There are NO new players joining the game anymore everyday as Blizzard wants and almost 50% of the playerbase don't even care about raiding at all, so, it's impossible to accept blizzard statement that &quot;they're not seeing new players killing Ragnaros every week, there should be new players every day killing it&quot;.<br />
<br />
So, please, stop analyzing stuff like 2 months in a 7 boss instance with everyone starting at least in 353+ at 85 = 6 months of leveling + gearing/rep farming + 12 raid bosses (13 in heroic). If this patch is supposed to match 4.0+4.1 for 6 months it should be the way it is with only 7 bosses and nothing else. If at the end of 5/6 months, everything was like that, then it would need re-tunning. But let's face it, there are tons of players working on Rag normal for example and most of them would get the kill with 4 months ahead of them. Stupid to say that everyone able to kill him alread did and nobody else would do it with 4 months left.</div></div><hr />

I actually was thinking, when this was first announced a relatively long time ago, that 19th would be on a Wednesday, reset day and all. Then today I realised it's tomorrow (Monday), which is weird a bit. At least we've done all we could, so bring the nurf.</div></div><hr />

Its showing on every front - including the lack of news coming forward. <br />
<br />
PPL have said it here before. Cata has failed simply because it did not build a bridge between leveling, the 5 man content and the raiding. Its really a joke to see how Blizzard has done their balancing in this expansion. Instead of building a solid experienced based on gratual improving players and raids... they just took a piss on the entire experience from start to finish. If they want ppl to enjoy see the content - they should change the raids to 5 man instances instead of nering them to the ground.<br />

Wow this has so much fail in it. Post a link where Blizzard had two development teams on BC. And they don't have interns there either. Stop with the hyperbole. Cata isn't my favorite expac either, but do some research before you type anything on here.</div></div><hr />

It's common sense that a guild raiding 7/7HC it's 100% certain that they will tracking their progress on sites.</div></div><hr />

Source on this? Love to see where a random player gets statistics that only a blizzard employee can possibly know, stop acting all knowing, because quite simply, you have no idea what you're talking about. If you think there are &quot;NO&quot; new players joining the game every day you must be delusional, simple as that, I think you underestimate how large and dominant this game is.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, guess it's time to finally unsubscribe. Which means more money in the pocket I guess is the bright side. Unless they can pull out something amazing for the patch and the expansion doubt I'll be playing when it hits. Void Storage and Transmogrification isn't enough to keep me interested.</div></div><hr />

Is it just me, or does this indeed somehow indicate that we'll see some love for TBC content in near future? (next patch or expansion perhaps)<br />
<br />
No, what they did is correct, they need to nerf things down. when raids lunch they start at a certain difficulty level, and heroic raids or pro raids start progressing till they down all heroic bosses, and they keep doing it for a while, and other raids will try their best to down normal boss or little bit on heroic. later on deathwing will start, so they need to nerf things down for others to get gear and exp. so at ph1 of raid, good guild and high pro guilds will have their fun then its just a matter of fun, then in p2 its other guilds time to down him and have fun and gear for future raids.</div></div><hr />
