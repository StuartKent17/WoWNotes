Patch 4.1 on PTR - Zul'aman and Zul'gurub are back!<br />
Patch 4.1 is hitting the PTRs and is full of surprises!<br />
That's right, folks. Development on the first major content patch for World of Warcraft: Cataclysm is well underway! We're currently making preparations to bring some of the initial content and updates we've been working on for this patch to the Public Test Realms. So you ask, &quot;what will we find in the first 4.1 test client?&quot; (You did ask that, right?) Well, let me tell you!<br />
<br />
The Gurubashi Tribe Persists<br />
<br />
Originally a 20-player dungeon released in patch 1.7, Zul'Gurub will once again open its gates, featuring updated lore, all-new encounters, achievements, and improved loot! Zul'Gurub is now a level-85 five-player Heroic difficulty dungeon. To provide a new tier above the current Cataclysm dungeons, players can expect to find epic-quality item level 353 loot. The minimum average item level to enter this Heroic dungeon is 346.<br />
<br />
The Return of Zul'Aman<br />
<br />
Ever a player favorite, the level-70 ten-player dungeon of Zul'Aman is being reintroduced as a level-85 Heroic five-player dungeon. Zul'Aman will join Zul'Gurub in a new Dungeon Finder tier of Heroic dungeons, providing epic-quality item level 353 loot. The minimum average item level to enter this Heroic dungeon is also 346. While Zul'Aman will be more of a throwback to the original dungeon featuring many of the same encounters, players can expect to find some updated gameplay mechanics, as well as new environment textures and lighting.<br />
<br />
With the Zuls returning, you may be wondering about the unique mounts that were once contained therein. We're pleased to announce that new versions of the rare raptor, tiger, and bear mounts will be available, while the old versions of these mounts will remain unique to those who already have them. We'll reveal more about how these updated mounts can be obtained in the future.<br />
<br />
Class Design<br />
While we do intend to make fewer balance changes in patch 4.1, you can still expect to find a fair number of updates. Below are just a few we'd like to share with you right now. Keep in mind these changes don't encompass the entirety of the 4.1 changes, nor do the initial Public Test Realm patch notes.<br />
<br />
To start, we want to do a better job of balancing the AoE power of the different damage-dealing specs. You can expect to see some changes to this end made throughout the testing process.<br />
<br />
Inner Rage is now available at level 56. It was intended to solve an excess rage problem that largely isn’t affecting warriors anymore. We’ve added a replacement ability for warriors at level 83: Rallying Cry.<br />
<br />
Colossus Smash now ignores 70% of an opponent's armor, down from 100%. We are compensating Fury and Arms warriors by increasing the damage of other attacks.<br />
<br />
Word of Glory: We want Retribution and Protection paladins to have reasonable healing on themselves or others, but we know paladins sometimes feel like they can’t use their Holy Power on anything but their heals in some situations. We’d rather these two specs spend most of their Holy Power on damage-dealing abilities, with occasional healing.<br />
<br />
More To Come<br />
<br />
We're still hard at work on additional features, balance updates, and bug fixes for patch 4.1. We look forward to sharing more information with you in the days and weeks ahead as we release new content on the Public Test Realms. Until then, have a look at the patch notes we've prepared thus far. As always, these notes are not final and will continue to change as we go through the iterative development and testing processes.<br />
<br />
<br />

Hey, you* asked for it when you said you didn't like the then-new instances, and would like to see old content updated for level 80. Though I doubt this will become a widespread thing, even heroic SFK and Deadmines didn't create that much of positive feedback.<br />

We get new 5man instances, which you can run in a guildgroup, where you wont need any of the drops, because, really, you are in 359 gear minimum. You always take along 1 enchanter and hey presto, your shortage of crystals has just been solved without having to shard raiddrops and/or run old raids.<br />
<br />
Besides, ZG and ZA were both uberepicness galore, I dont mind them making it into a 5man encounter. Firelands should be interesting, but depends on how many bosses and/or raid instances they'll be divided into.</div></div><hr />

Zul'aman didn't give me that feeling though, it was fun, but hardly challenging if you could run it with 6 guildies and make 4 people pay an entry fee for a shot at the warbear then make them bid against eachother once it dropped (Guild money skyrocketed back then).<br />
<br />
Now, looking at the caster legendary, it's an item gained in the Hyjal raid it seems...<br />
Will this be the War of the Ancients raid I've been waiting for so long? I'm a lore fan, and I read the trilogy so this really tickles my fancy.<br />
I do wonder what the caster legendary will be though, dagger/mace/sword/staff? Or a combo of 2 different things so all casters can aim for it?<br />
Val'anyr was hardly a good healer legendary in WotLK, so here's hoping healers can get it as well.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, yes, it's recycled content, but I have a feeling Zul'gurub will get quite a bit of polishing because the old model details and ground clutter effects for that place would be really outdated now. Paired with a completely new setting (if you've done STV quests to place yourself in it) then yeah, it's not recycled as much as it's a storyline in progress. <br />
<br />
Not every bit of progression has to be met with a complete change of scenery in my oppinion.</div></div><hr />

It should be epic = raid.<br />
To be fair, the 353 ilvl means that the items in there won't even compete with the current tier's normal mode items, so I think your epic status is safe. And after all.... you were always able to get epics from dungeons, even in vanilla. They were just horrendously itemized and had a .2% drop rate!</div></div><hr />

There's a very good chance that it will be new bosses/stories, etc. I don't think anybody would really consider the new SFK or Deadmines even remotely similar to their original incarnations, after all. I've a feeling it will be like that.<br />

I loved ZA and ZG, during their time. I also loved Naxx when it was hard, and Onyxia the first time around. I liked killing Rag the first time. Kael's re-appearance in Magister's Terrace was, admittedly, hilarious. Anub in ToC? Sure.<br />
<br />
But seriously.. how many &quot;just a set-backs&quot; are we gonna have?<br />
<br />
I love Troll dungeons. I want people to be able to do them and get shiny mounts, but come on. Why re-use the old ones? Why not make two new wings of a new Troll epic dungeon, like with the ICC 5-mans? The new fights will likely be good the first few times around, but.. meh. Just meh.<br />
<br />
5.2 will bring the re-re-return of Onyxia! After being beaten and killed so many times, she'll be nothing more than an animated skeleton.<br />
5.3 will shuffle in the re-emergence of Hogger and Gamon! These two epic beings have teamed up to bring the pain.<br />
6.1 will awaken the mighty Illidan, who's very angry that you killed all of his whores in Black Temple!<br />
6.2 will show Azeroth that Tempest Keep and Magister's Terrace was just another setback for Kael, as he makes a grand return!<br />
6.3 Baron Rivendare is back, and boy is he mad!<br />
7.0 In a special Caverns of Time encounter, the heroes will go back to the icy continent of Northrend to stop the heroes from killing the Lich King.<br />
7.1 Arthas!<br />
8.1 From the depths, he has returned! Ghamoo-Ra, the mighty turtle thought defeated in Blackfathom Deeps makes his earth-shattering presence known!</div></div><hr />

<br />
Note that you need 346 average ilvl to even get there, which means that you either have been farming your ass off to get full 346 gear or you've already been in a raid. Also the epics from the heroic aren't even as high ilvl as those that drop from BWD AND there's going to be a new raiding tier anyway and you'll be able to buy higher ilvl stuff with JP. 353 ilvl is probably what they'd expect you to have at least when you enter the firelands (supposing that'll be the next raid)<br />
<br />
If they didn't implement this, the only ways of getting gear that's good enough for the next raid would be by farming your ass off in heroics for JP and buy epics that way, which would suck.<br />
<br />
If you've already cleared BWD or if you're doing good progress there, then this change shouldn't affect you one darn bit. The new players won't outgear you with that heroic and by the time this is out and those new toons are whacking their way through that heroic for less-than-BWD gear, you should be in the next raid tier whacking for gear that's better than BWD.</div></div><hr />

If you dont like recycled content ill suggest quitting.<br />
<br />
So by taking a mount that my self and other grinded for years to get and putting armor on it makes it better some how ? I'ts taking a piss from great hight at people that made an effort to get something rare, if you can't see the problem with the reoccurring use of this recycling then you are truly blind.<br />
<br />
And why do I have to quit if I don't like it, that is one of the worst arguments that is being used way to much these days. If everyone would follow that suggestion you wouldn't have a game to play as most people disagrees with something that is being changed. We shuld all be expecting much more then we are getting from Blizzard in my opinion, it's a multi billion dollar company that provides a semi tested product that reuses popular things from the past to please the masses, not exactly bang for your buck.<br />
<br />
If Blizzard spent all the income they get from selling the game and the subscriptions on the actual game then we wouldn't see shit like this, instead we get the watered down recycled content to fill the gaps while they funnel cash in to new projects. Where is our return on that risk capital ?</div></div><hr />

Doubt it. These days, &quot;higher itemlevel&quot; indeed means something, the base stat (Str/Agi/Int) is always higher, and reforging makes even suboptimal green stats at least ok. It's closer with 353 items, but currently, a 359 is in most cases better than a 346 item (excluding weird stuff like trinkets)<br />
Also, bear in mind that (in Cata) item quality has no importance for the stat distribution, it's solely the itemlevel. Compare 318 greens to 318 blues.</div></div><hr />

You say this before you even see what's being completely done with the instances. The PTRs aren't even up for you to look at to make a proper judgement call. Hell, Boubouille isn't even done compiling all of the new data/tooltips yet.<br />
<br />
Look at the achievements. There are loads of new bosses, and the old bosses probably have new dynamic encounters now, too. This isn't an instance where &quot;we're re-releasing an instance because hardly anyone ever got to play it in its original incarnation&quot;, this is &quot;we're redesigning this instance so that it's fun again because everyone's done this at level 60/70 a billion times.&quot;<br />

<br />
Epics from 5mans QQ? There is a very strong possibility you will be able to get 359 epics incl T11 from badges from heroics only so... You know :P. Its the natural form of progression, if you are actually raiding right now you should be well above 353ilvl already, hell todays epics from say BWD are 359 so that loot will be nothing special at all.<br />
<br />
Rare mounts coming back in a bit changed form? Hell yea, why not. They probably wont be anything special because even with 1% drop you can run these on several characters daily so they are just a lovely addition, people who have old time mounts will still be able to feel like unique snowflakes... Like anyone cares about (ground) mounts anyway...<br />

How about demanding some actually new content? Blizzard has stopped even trying to pretend that they put any effort into producing content, &quot;hey guys, lets just take some random old raids and dungeons, bastardize them, call them new content and lets hit the pub.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
Consider the fact, that you will need ilvl 346 to enter those dungeons, so it's for ppl who already have full hc gear. Not 100% of WoW players are raiders and everyone wants to have some kind of progress available for them. Normal raid 359 items will still be better. Since I'm not raiding ATM, I'm really excited about new content and new gear.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Personally, I really don't like going trough reused content again. I allready dislike running Deadmines and SFK, they are vanilla dungeons so PLS just keep it them.<br />
<br />
Besides, what will happen with the current 10 man lvl 70 Zul'Aman? Its going to be removed or what? I wish Blizzard could just release another part of Zul'Aman...</div></div><hr />

<br />
This is a concern of mine too. I wish they would stop removing instances. Level 80 onyxia raid could just as easily been accessed through a side door, thus leaving levle 60 onyxia intact. TOC 10/25 and TOC 5 man use different extrances for different instances.<br />
<br />
This would level level 70 Zul Aman as it is, but still allow the levle 85 5 man version to co-exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Shame on you Blizzard, you gave in eventually.<br />
<br />
Eventually?<br />
<br />
Uh they told us they would be doing this before cata launched.<br />
<br />
Each new teir will have 5 mans that provide gear roughly equal to the previous tier, to allow you to gear up alts faster and to allow you to start on the new tier without having to farm old content for months on end like we used to do in TBC.<br />
<br />
Raid kara/gruul/mags to do (heroics to do) SSC and TK, raid SSC and TK to do Hyjal and BT.<br />
<br />
And that was the only way to progress. We didnt even get badges of justice until later on in TBC.</div></div><hr />

1. Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman are being updated WITH WHAT APPEAR TO BE NEW BOSSES, IT'S NOT JUST A RECYCLE. IT'S LIKE DEADMINES AND SFK.<br />
<br />
2. Caster Legendary damn-near confirmed for Caverns of Time.<br />
<br />
3. Hydras tamable by Hunters.<br />
<br />
4. Lots of new pets, some new and returning mounts, and new pet-collecting achievements.<br />
<br />
5. Tying into the pet thing, looks like the Winterspring Frostsaber mount will be renovated to act like the current Venomhide Ravasaur daily quests. This most likely means it will take at least 20 days to get the mount but will require much less work on your part, as opposed to what used to be an indefinitely long grind but became a 5 day grind and is now a 2 day grind. Glad I have mine already.<br />
<br />
6. Various class changes, as expected.<br />

I just have one gripe: How long before I can solo ZA and ZG for the mounts again? I have luck issues, even more prominent with the cataclysm rare drops.</div></div><hr />

just to note, the epics still aren't BWD/BoT/TFW/crafted ilvl, they are half an ilvl lower, but they will give casuals a boost into the older content if they are still having trouble with it, everyone else will be heading to firelands for their 372/385 gear</div></div><hr />

Cue the casual vs. hardcore debate in 3...2...<br />

Oh, and um, paladin nerfs, rabble rabble...</div></div><hr />

Another problem is that when you can get almost previous-tier level gear without raiding, the latest raid tier can't be balanced assuming the people raiding it have learned the basics of raiding from the previous tier - they're jumping to the latest tier straight from 5mans. Thus, Heroic Modes might get progressively harder, but normal mode raid difficulty won't be changing much from the first tier (which was roughly the case in WoTLK, ICC normal wasn't any more difficult than Ulduar normal).</div></div><hr />

<br />
I want to see statistics for deaths to the Blackwing Descent lift. Every raid we have engineers parachuting into the lava, or a pala/mage missing their cast and dying. It's hella funny</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. Naxxramas <br />
2. Onyxia<br />
3. Onyxia and Nefarian<br />
4. Ragnaros<br />
5. ZA/ZG<br />
6. to a less extent, Kael'thas<br />
<br />
If you think about it, over 6 years this isn't an awful lot of recycled content.<br />
<br />
Deadmines and SFK. Techincally all of azeroth has been recyled but thats ok since that was a complete revamp.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Missed the point a bit there - epic shard prices will be dropping from 2.5k or so down to sub 100g after not too long, not something i look forward to.</div></div><hr />

Did ZG on my DK 50 times for mount. Yawn Yawn Yawn<br />
<br />
Rehash content again and again. Not suprising as they fired 500 ppls tho<br />
Game is dead for most, and more will leave with lazy yawn rehash content. And more welfare epix hahahaha<br />
<br />
<br />
But it means more of the good players will come to Rift :D Leave the scrubs in Wow<br />
<br />
Probably it's too late, but maybe knowing that in Rift you get epics at level ~15 (pants) just by doing rifts (zergfest) and more epics in other zones could make you change idea and keep playing WoW?</div></div><hr />

Why does that even matter? Rare and Epic quality items no longer have different amounts of itemization. A purple item of 353 ilvl will have the exact same itemization as a blue item of 353 ilvl. Would WoW be a better place if we were all colorblind? I wonder sometimes.</div></div><hr />

I can see it now...<br />
<br />
The corruption from the Well of Eternity was so powerful it took ten thousand years to subside, but the elves of Azeroth have finally shed their mutation and reverted to their purest form -- Trolls.<br />
Unfortunately, Naga remain as their mutation was caused by the Old Gods.<br />
<br />
Anyone who would rather quit than play something other than an elf is someone I'd be happy to see go.<br />
Glorious.</div></div><hr />

What a let down... instead of new and interesting dungeons we're gonna go get some old rehashed content. <br />
<br />
I hope they don't do the same with raids (per say bring Molten Core or Karazhan back as tier 12/13).<br />
<br />
This expansion is by far the worse. =(</div></div><hr />
