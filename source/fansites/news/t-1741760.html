Dev Stats - Blue Tweets<br />
Today we are looking at the frequency of developer tweets with the 3 week moving average of the number of tweets every week. The @WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs) account replaced (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/535234869274873856) most of the developer's individual accounts from November 19, 2014.<br />
<br />
Using a moving average smooths out the data. Keep in mind we are only including tweets used in news posts, which means that extremely busy news weeks will show less tweets than there really were, such as around Blizzcon or when we fell behind on posting and skipped ahead to catch up. Looking at the overall number of developer tweets every week isn't a great metric, as most of the developers didn't keep their tweeting confined to just WoW.<br />

Armory Stats - Number of Max-Level Characters<br />
Today we are taking a look at the number of Level 100 characters that players have compared to the number they had a month or so after release. There are 6.1 million characters and 3.1 million accounts that make up this sample at Level 100. It appears people have had time to level alts in the past few months<br />
<br />
While collecting this data, we came across some fun outliers, such as the player that has 195+ Level 100 characters.<br />

Misc<br />
a community with a strongly positive core and with the tools to do so will often police itself. I like to think we could do so.<br />
Riot's approach of computer-learning what the community considers bad and then enforcing it seemingly proved very effective too. (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/577898038410096640))<br />
<br />
That's the scary part, best way to judge a person is what they do when they can get away with it.<br />
toxic behavior also has a way of prompting otherwise decent people to lash out in frustration too (craig_amai (https://twitter.com/craig_amai/status/577906419325759488))<br />

<br />
At the moment they have got a system that automatically mutes you in game when you get reported enough times. There are no limits to reports and nobody watches if they are valid so people are getting muted randomly everywhere.<br />
<br />
Previously they had a system called tribunal where instead of getting automatically muted, the reports on you were sent to the &quot;tribunal&quot; where playerbase could vote if reported player should be BANNED or not. As you might figure, the same people who were spamming reports at literally everything without reason were also spamming &quot;vote punish&quot; at every case that got into their hands, so people were getting actually banned randomly everywhere.</div></div><hr />

Some people find leveling to be the fun part of the game. I'm guess most of those characters are leveled then immediately abandoned, and probably cover every class/race/gender combo in the game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
ON topic I have 5 lvl 100's, 687 is my main with my alt at 675 and the others drifting around 640.<br />
<br />
The legendary does put my off from levelling alts, but I am fine with that. What is different this expansion, personally, is that I am content to raid/main just one character for the expansion. I am lucky, I think, to have a real affinity to my main (monk tank) -tanking is what I enjoy -but with the Garrisons I no longer feel the need to diverge time into alts; if I have spare time I can dabble into Garrison duties or Pets or Raid old content for fun or Achievements. Etc.<br />
<br />
I think that's what Garrisons bring, as a positive, an investment to your mains -for those that do not need alts. Otherwise I am perfectly fine with my alts and their Garrsisons. I use Master Plan to quickly and efficiently plow through Missions and regularly keep my alts' Garrisons ticking over with minimal fuss. At the end of the week my alts are ticking into their respective Legendary lines without much (if any) actual play, and (for the first expansion ever) I am happy with my alts as a long term project.<br />
<br />
Anyway, just my experience!</div></div><hr />

And the two I do play I focus mostly on running my one heroic dungeon and doing the weekly LFR, oh and my daily pet training battles. I'm not sure if I'll level my other alts or not. I've been losing alt steam since cata and have been leveling fewer and fewer alts since then.</div></div><hr />

Currently at 10 lvl 100. Gearing 9 of them and 4 have full conquest gear. Working on the others. No, i have no life :)<br />
<br />
I am right there as well I currently have 8 level 100's at or above 640 ilvl, with working on another three right now that are at least above 620. I am also leveling two others that are in the mid 90's. I have never had this many characters leveled and geared to some sort of degree this early in the expansion before. I usually wait a couple patches to level and gear other characters. I have even started leveling another 5 characters ranging from 28 to 49. I hope to have all them leveled before 6.2 even drops.<br />
<br />
I really don't need all these characters, but I have been running old content (something I usually reserve for later in the expansion) which I am now getting bored to death over and at the same time finishing achievements out in the current world as well as rep grinding. I am trying hard to spread things out, so I don't run out of things to do.</div></div><hr />

6 of the 100s are between 645-655 gear level and hit 100 in 6.0, the last is at 632<br />
The level 95 will probably get pushed up next, if only because the 97 is a disc priest and their solo leveling got smacked down recently</div></div><hr />

<br />
playing devils advocate, its also recently become very easy to level from 90 to 100. alot of people had man level 90 alts from the mop SoO content drought. with the heirlooms and the exp potion, you can easily level alts from 90 to 100 in about 8 hours or less play time. But even with that in mind, 5 alts sounds very biased towards the MMO-player base, which is traditionally more hardcore than the actual player base. <br />

Maybe it's the total amount of max level characters? Someone that only had one max level character at the time the data was collected could have leveled another character to max level before the data for 6.1 was collected. That would put him in another category.</div></div><hr />

Yup. I always wonder if people are actually voting honestly when they vote in polls. In the future at some point I'll add verification. For example, with this poll I would have had you enter one of your character's names so that I could see which account is yours and how many characters you have. This way polls will be significantly closer to reality.<br />

I don't ever spend more than 10 hours per week online.<br />
<br />
The graph would have probably been more informative if it was x or more characters instead of exactly x.<br />
<br />
As far as the 195+ account. Either A, some is really into leveling and does like 1 per day (which is doable) B, some really likes to multibox to the max, or C, there is some community that shares one Bnet account. I wonder if all 4 accounts are active. Personally, I know of cases where a married couple share an account.

No, I brainfarted. What Chaud said makes sense. As soon as people that only had one make another 100, they lower the percentage. It was early in the morning &gt;&lt; I was reading percentages and my brain was talking to me in absolute values or something... or I was still asleep.<br />
<br />
I have 3 at level 100, btw. My main, of course, and the 2 that I always level to have access to mats and crafting, 1 of which I always say I'm going to learn to tank on, but never do. I can't bring myself to take them out, even into LFR. The DK is on the abrogator stones, and I still can't for the life of me figure out why I am bothering. Then I have a shaman that I started, even made level 91 crafted epics for, that has gone from 91 to 95 just in the garrison. It isn't the class necessarily, it is the fact that to do anything even remotely fun with him, I would want to take him to an alt raid or something, and the laundry list of things to do just makes me ... not want to do them. I even used the character recovery to bring back deleted toons so now I have one of everything. Again, I don't know why...<br />
<br />
Love my mage though, and look forward to raiding every week. So it isn't the game necessarily, but the repetition of tasks. I think somehow the garrison feels like more of and impediment than dailies used to, even though I know I didn't have to do either one.</div></div><hr />

A couple years ago I ran into a player that seemed to have 50+ characters on one server before server merges. I stopped bothered trying to bid against him in the BMAH since there was no way I could stand against the kind of gold they probably generated passively. There were probably more characters that what I found at a glance since with at least 5 WoW accounts on that one battle.net he could have had 250+. My assumption was they multiboxed through dungeons as complete parties with instant queues, which might have been pretty fast.<br />
<br />
How are you fingerprinting accounts?</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Gonder</div><div class="date">2015-03-25, 01:01 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">I still only have one character at level cap at this time, though I'm trying to get some of my others up there too. I have two level 91s at the moment, though my only problem is, and I don't know why: a lot of the time, the Draenor questing experience, especially when I'm trying to rush through it at lightening speed, is just so BORING. I play my warrior and in about twenty minutes, I'm yawning like a machine, feeling all drowsy, because I'm just that bored. My first to 100 was an Alliance, though I do also have a hunter who I am trying to level up, and I've been trying to immerse him into the experience again (because it's Horde, so it's different), and to be truthful, this does help me do the content at the time I am doing it, though now my problem with my hunter is finding the motivation to even get on him and level him in the first place, because thinking about reading so many more quests, as interesting as the story may be, kind of puts me off, and it's just so time consuming, it's kind of stressful to an extent.<br />
<br />
Either way, finding the energy to push through these leveling experiences has been tremendously difficult, and luckily, I didn't feel it on my first run through. Really, with just one character at level cap, I've been having an adequate amount of fun as of far, enjoying what end content there is, soloing old raids, hunting achievements, etc. I know a lot of people have been bored with the game at the moment, with the content drought and all, though luckily, I've been finding enough content to keep me occupied that I really haven't been feeling that yet.</div></div><hr />
