Love is in the Air! Be careful because it seems that love isn't around for long in World of Warcraft: this event will start on February 11 at 06:00AM and end on February 16 at 06:00AM. (Server time) <br />
<br />
The Fool for Love (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1693) meta-achievement is obviously a part of the What A Long, Strange Trip It's Been (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=2145) achievement to get the Violet Proto-Drake (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2008/september/8970/mount_violetprotodrake.jpg) (310% Speed Flying Mount).<br />
<br />
Most of these achievements are easily completed because they rely heavily on items found in Gifts of Adorations (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration) and Pledge of Adoration (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration). You can easily get them and you can also buy them from other players at the Auction House if you're running short on time. <br />
<br />
Heartmender (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=260)<br />
Use the Unbestowed Friendship Bracelets (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22259) on 20 players affected by the Heartbroken (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=26898) debuff. You can find the bracelets inside the Gift of Adorations (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration) you get when you offer a Love Token (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21815) to a guard in capital cities. <br />
<br />
http://static.wowhead.com/images/alliance-icon.gifNation of Adoration (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1697) / http://static.wowhead.com/images/horde-icon.gifNation of Adoration (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1698)<br />
Get a Gift of Adorations (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration) from each capital city. <br />
<br />
Tokens (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21815) are bought from Innkeepers during the event. Giving a token to a guard will affect you with the Adored (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=26680) debuff and will reward you with a Gift of Adorations (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration). This won't work all the time, you can also get the Heartbroken (http://www.wowhead.com/?spell=26898) debuff and in this case you just won't get anything. You can cancel the Heartbroken debuff with a Unbestowed Friendship Bracelets (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22259) ... Which is the whole point of the achievement! Just make other players happy! <br />
<br />
Flirt with Disaster (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1279)<br />
Drink enough alcohol to be completely smashed, buy a Perfume Bottle (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21829) from the closest Innkeeper selling it, and use your Bouquet of Red Roses (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22206) or Bouquet of Ebon Roses (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44731) on either <br />
http://static.wowhead.com/images/alliance-icon.gifSraaz (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=9099) or http://static.wowhead.com/images/horde-icon.gifJeremiah Payson (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=8403) depending on your faction. <br />
<br />
Nearest and Dearest (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1695)<br />
Buy some Perfume (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21829) or Cologne (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21833) along with a few Love Tokens (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21815) and complete the http://static.wowhead.com/images/alliance-icon.gifDangerous Love (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8903) or http://static.wowhead.com/images/horde-icon.gifDangerous Love (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8904) questline depending on your faction. They're simple delivery quests and you shouldn't have any problem with that. <br />
<br />
Sweet Tooth (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1702)<br />
Eat a Buttermilk Delight (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22236), Dark Desire (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22237), Sweet Surprise (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22239) and a Very Berry Cream (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22238). All these items are found in the Box of Chocolate (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21812) contained in Gifts of Adorations (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration) and Pledge of Adoration (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration). If you plan to do the other achievements this one won't be a problem as you'll have plenty of them available. <br />
<br />
My Love is Like a Red, Red Rose (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1703)<br />
Obtain a Bouquet of Red Roses (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22206) or Bouquet of Ebon Roses (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44731).<br />
The Bouquet of Red Roses (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22206) was found on Archivist Galford (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=10811) (Stratholme), Illyanna Ravenoak (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=11488) (Dire Maul), Princess Moira Bronzebeard (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=8929) (Blackrock Depths) and Lorekeeper Polkelt (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=10901) but is no longer obtainable <br />
The Bouquet of Ebon Roses (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44731) is found on Maiden of Grief (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=27975) (Halls of Stone), Prince Keleseth (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=23953) (Utgarde Keep) and Prince Taldaram (http://www.wowhead.com/?npc=29308). <br />
<br />
Shafted! (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1188)<br />
Use Silver Shafted Arrow (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22200) on 10 players, once again you can find this item in the Gifts of Adorations (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration) and Pledge of Adoration (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration) and it should be pretty easy to have enough of them to complete the achievement. If you really need more arrows you can also complete the Alliance Gift Collection (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22262)/Horde Gift Collection (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22263) and complete the quest (http://www.wowhead.com/?quest=8981) to get 5 extra arrows but it's going to waste a LOT of your time. <br />
<br />
Lonely? (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1291)<br />
Join someone for a picnic in Dalaran! This will require a Romantic Picnic Basket (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34480), this is a rare drop from Gifts of Adorations (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration) and Pledges of Adoration (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration). If you're not lucky with droprates, you can still find someone with the basket and share a picnic with him/her to complete your achievement. <br />
<br />
The Rocket's Pink Glare (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1696)<br />
Shoot off 10 Love Rockets (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=34258) in 20 seconds or less. This is another easy achievement, you can find the rockets in Gifts of Adorations (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration) and Pledges of Adoration (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration). <br />
<br />
Fistful of Love (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1699)<br />
Use a Handful of Rose Petals (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22218) or your Bouquet of Red Roses (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22206) / Bouquet of Ebon Roses (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=44731) on each of the race/class combination. Handful of Petals (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22218) are found in Gifts of Adorations (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration) and Pledges of Adoration (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration). <br />
<br />
Be Mine! (http://www.wowhead.com/?achievement=1701)<br />
Use the Bag of Candies (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=21813) found in Gifts of Adorations (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration) and Pledges of Adoration (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration) to create each of the hearts listed. <br />
<br />

Obtain a Love Fool (http://www.wowhead.com/?item=22261) from a Gifts of Adorations (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=gift+of+adoration) or Pledges of Adoration (http://www.wowhead.com/?search=pledge+of+adoration) and use it in the specified locations. Once the Love Fool is on the ground just target it and do a /pity emote. <br />

<br />
Hunter Ammo Changes partially removed from Patch 3.1.0<br />
In our 3.1.0 class updates post, we had announced plans to remove consumable ammunition from the game upon the release of the next major content patch. Our original plans were to change ammunition so that hunters would no longer need to utilize bag space, while adding some new functionality that would continue to make ammunition a compelling element of gameplay. Unfortunately, this intended change will not be completely ready in time for patch 3.1.0.<br />
<br />
We still fully intend to move forward with this change when the additional functionality becomes available, and for 3.1.0 we still intend to remove the need for pouches/quivers by greatly increasing the stack sizes on arrows and bullets, and the haste bonus from the bags will be preserved in another fashion. We’ll be sure to inform our players with further updates once they become available. <br />

Unintentional instance saving<br />
We did speak with some of the developers about this recently. While I'm unable to comment on your specific suggestions, I'll say we were all in agreement that something needs to change with raid IDs. On the one hand, we are happy that pick-up groups have a wider array of options at their disposal, whether it be 5, 10, or 25 man content. On the other hand though, it's currently too easy to end up saved to an instance that's been cleared, or close to it, without knowing ahead of time this will happen.<br />
<br />
We've been looking at player feedback in this regard, and are working to develop a better interface to warn players that will be saved to an instance that's been partially, or completely cleared. This is something that might not happen in 3.1, but we'll be discussing this further internally in the near future.

Savage Defense<br />
It isn't intended as a buff or nerf per se. As many players have surmised, we want to make gearing as a bear tank more interesting, yet we don't have a lot of room to expand on stamina, dodge or armor. In this case the specific numbers are not as important as the general idea, though we also think the specific numbers are a really good place to start.

Plans to changes hunter ammos in 3.1.0 cancelled<br />
One of the things we have been trying to do more of is give players a sneak peak at what we are working on. The risk of course is that players become disappointed or even outraged when some of the changes don't come to pass. The traditional Blizzard tight-lipped responses and invocation of &quot;soon&quot; are partially for this reason. It used to be that everyone found out about class changes through patch notes.<br />
<br />
Blizzard uses the development model of iterative design more than almost anyone else in the industry. We go through a ton of changes before you see a fraction of them. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/14990442844-hunters--when-addtl-tech-is-avail.html))<br />

Arcane Barrage Nerfed<br />
A last minute change was made to the mage Arcane Barrage spell which reduced its spell power coefficient. This change did not make it into the 3.0.9 patch notes. We will be carefully evaluating this change and its effects on game balance in both PvE and PvP. If you have constructive feedback to provide, please do so in this thread.

Hymns<br />
Keep in mind that the changes we listed as a possible for the future patch are just a short list. I believe Ghostcrawler did say that Hymns are something we'd like to look at, but I couldn't say specifically if anything is planned for them just yet.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">MagicSN</div><div class="date">2009-02-11, 10:58 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">As to the instance saving: Maybe they should look at the solution done in the MMO &quot;LOTRO&quot;. While the game IMHO is generally not as good<br />
as WoW the lock system in LOTRO I like much better than the one from WoW.<br />
<br />
In this game it works like that:<br />
<br />
- On the raid tab there is a special section about instance locks. Instead of (like in WoW) just the name of the instance you see behind the<br />
name of the instance a list of &quot;instance steps&quot; (don't remember the exact term they use in LOTRO, but something like that). So for example<br />
if you have a raid instance with 7 bosses, and you killed boss 1-3, it lists: &quot;My Raid Instance: 1,2,3&quot; in your raid UI.<br />
- On another part of the Raid UI it lists &quot;the locks of the raid group&quot;. So let's imagine you have killed bosses 1,2,3, but another one of the<br />
group has killed bosses 1,2,3,4. In this case this part of the raid UI lists &quot;My Raid Instance: 1,2,3,4&quot;. And if you look at the UI you clearly<br />
see someone killed more bosses than you this id already. This entry shows the &quot;highest&quot; list of bosses killed by all people.<br />
- Now the important part: If someone killed MORE BOSSES this id than the LEADER of the instance a message &quot;incompatible raid locks&quot; comes<br />
up and NOBODY can enter the instance. The only way to fix this is by giving raid lead to the person who has &quot;the most advanced lock&quot; (killed<br />
the most bosses) and then someone (the leader or someone else) enters the instance.<br />
- A big difference to WoW locks is this: Let's imagine raid member A killed 1,2,3 with raid group A. Raid member B killed 1,2,3,4 with Raid Group B<br />
before. In WoW they could not continue the raid together as they are on different locks. On LOTRO they give lead to Raid Member B, the locks<br />
are updated to 1,2,3,4. And now all can enter an instance where bosses 1-4 are dead, the rest still alive. This feature is especially extremely popular<br />
with PUGs. Ever encountered the problem that you killed one raid boss with a bad PUG and now you cannot do the raid this week anymore, as nobody<br />
is willing to skip the first boss? In LOTRO you just tell the other group to invite you once they killed the first boss with 11/12, then you get an invite<br />
and are on the same lock (as boss #1 is dead for both of you).<br />
- total impossible is just stuff like: Member A killed 1,2,3, and Member B killed 1,2,4. They cannot join the same raid unless they find someone who<br />
has killed 1-4, and they both take this guy's lock.<br />
- The downside of this IMHO especially for PUGs great system is that people trade around &quot;only endboss alive&quot; locks a lot to avoid to do the early bosses.<br />
You want your alt raid only to do the final boss? No problem, temporary log the alt into the main raid and &quot;copy their lock&quot;. Good thing is that it is<br />
completely transparent which lock you will join and there is no possibility (unless you forget to check on the Raid UI) you get a lock &quot;by mistake&quot;.</div></div><hr />

I spent hours arguing why replenishment was the problem, not the solution, and listing several examples without being all WAHHH QQ WAHHH. Now it just disappears and they white wash it? Fucking CM's.

<br />
Just you. Keep in mind that any change made has to be regressively tested against everything else. Inserting some sort of instance clear status checking that then checks the user and then warns them etc etc.. it kind of goes through all the streams, so while the actual logic itself is simple the implementation on such a large code base is probably pretty big.</div></div><hr />

No, you can't easily get them. They can't be put on the AH and they can't be mailed to your alts. You only get one gift/pledge per hour.

1) Bear trap is going to allow some dps before it breaks. <br />
<br />
Blizz: &quot;We've decided this not good enough and are going to roll this into freeze trap.&quot; <br />
Hunters: &quot;Yay!&quot; <br />
<br />
A few days pass. <br />
<br />
Blizz: &quot;Well, the technology does not exist. We'll do it when the technology is available.&quot; <br />
Hunters: &quot;That's understandable. We can wait a few months...&quot; <br />
<br />
2) 41 Survival is replaced with Trap Mastery. <br />
<br />
Blizz: &quot;Since we've given up on the 'Release when it's done philosophy' so we can make the holidays, this 41 talent will suck. Sorry. We'll fix it soon after launch of WOTLK.&quot; <br />
Hunters: &quot;Oh...kay...&quot; <br />
<br />
3) Disengage is broken at any angle except flat, even level land. <br />
<br />
Blizz: &quot;Well, the technology to fix this does not exist. We're working on technology to fix this...&quot; <br />
Hunters: &quot;Well... we can wait...&quot; <br />
<br />
4) Ammunition Changes in 3.1 <br />
<br />
Blizz: &quot;Down with ammo! Hunters for too long have had to PAY to arena, PAY to farm, PAY to do anything that no other classes has to pay to do. No more ammo pouches, no more ammo.&quot; <br />
Hunters: &quot;Yay!&quot; <br />
<br />
A few days later. <br />
<br />
Blizz: &quot;Well, the technology to change this does not exist. We're working on technology to fix it and will implement the chance when/if we ever have that technology.&quot; <br />

FFS Blizzard! Stop postphoning things, and fix the issues allready. Im seriously beginning to doubt about your programmers. <br />
<br />
Why can a DK do Deathgrip, and a hunter not have a similar technique for Disengage?! <br />
<br />
Why could u make Druids and DK pets jump towards targets, and never been able to fix the issue where Hunter pets walk all the way around agroing mobs in the entire instance instead of just jumping of?! They even have the jumping animation!<br />
<br />
Why cant u put the HEXX technology on the Freezing trap?!<br />
<br />
And why cant u make all bows act like the Sunwell bow?<br />
<br />
The techniques are there!! And uve run out of excuses. And when ur at it, also fix Heart of the Phoenix! To many arena matches are lost because my pet bars become gray and unusable after using Heart of the Phoenix. These arent mindbreaking fixes really.</div></div><hr />

Try few times, at least the Northrend ones aren't 100% droprate in normal mode at least . Tried UK 3 times in normal mode, dropped on third. Then we did it in heroic, dropped there again and I won.

GIFT of adoration is from NON-GUARDS. Same for flowers/poems/pies. Non-guards give these 100%. <br />

Guards give PLEDGE of adoration and cards/pledges.<br />

<br />
Granted this is a new problem because of easier raids and more people raiding. <br />
<br />
Personally, I think you should be able to right click on a toon and look up that toons raid info. After that you should be able to look up a raidID number and find out which bosses have been dropped.<br />
<br />
A confirmation screen would be nice before you enter. However, just the same it would be nice for raid instances like VoA where there are no mobs up, that you not get saved the sceond you zone in either. Maybe something along the lines of if you actually enter combat then you get saved. Or even a confirmation screen once you enter along the lines of what is currently in the game &quot;you are not in the right instance&quot; (or whatever the hell the the words are when you get booted out of an instance.). With something like &quot;you have entered a saved instance, you have 30 seconds to exit the instance before you get saved.&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
My test showed the same. Heck even the achievement in game specifies the handful of rose petals. <br />
<br />
Flirt with Disaster also specifies the handful of petals and NOT the bouquet.<br />
<br />
&quot;Most of these achievements are easily completed because they rely heavily on items found in Gifts of Adorations and Pledge of Adoration. You can easily get them and you can also buy them from other players at the Auction House if you're running short on time.&quot;<br />
<br />
Even this is 100% incorrect. The gifts and pledges were made BoP in 3.0.8 and if I recall there was even news about it on MMO. What gives? Who is doing these posts so poorly that they can't even get the information straight. I'm becoming increasingly disappointed with all the misinformation MMO Champion is spreading around. Get your facts straight or don't bother running a website about WoW.</div></div><hr />

Use the Unbestowed Friendship Bracelets on 20 players affected by the Heartbroken debuff. You can find the bracelets inside the Gift of Adorations you get when you offer a Love Token to a guard in capital cities. <br />

No.<br />
This one had be going for a while, but it's very much wrong.<br />
<br />
Do not give the guards any cards if you're trying to get this achievement, you'll receive the wrong package.<br />

<br />
One for each city. So in total you can do this in 3 hours.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you manage to get all the stuff you need for all those achievements in 3 hours, I salute you. Personally I am missing 1 chocolate, 10 arrows, 2 fools and 15 bracers. And I HAVE completed the nation of adoration achivement and collected the gift packages one whole time. If you have limited time for playing, this achievement title is a pain! :S (if you ask me anyway).<br />
<br />
Also, like others have said, seems only non-guards give you the packages.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bbr</div><div class="date">2009-02-12, 09:50 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">The reason it's 3 hours, is because you get a 1 hour debuff each time you do it.<br />
So, you do 1, get the package.<br />
Go to the next town, do 1 more, next down and done.<br />
<br />
Assuming you don't get debunked, that's all you need to do.<br />
<br />
The full collection requires 3x 5 of each, from each city.<br />
But that doesn't really seem to give anything other than a +int buff... rather useless.<br />
<br />
<br />
At any rate for the other achievements you can make 9 alts and have them do it once an hour as well. then give the arrows, and most other items to your main.<br />
You only get candy once an hour though. (bind on pickup) And there's the quest you can do for chocolate.<br />
<br />
Guards do give packages with stuff (once an hour while not debuffed), but just not the one for the nation of adoration.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I remember hearing when they took out awarding the titles to the races/classes that hit 80 first because it &quot;promoted an unhealthy style of gaming.&quot; It seems to me this is along those lines.<br />
<br />
Sure, logging in once and hour and clicking on an NPC isn't as bad as staying up for three days straight to level from 70-80, but come on, seriously? I managed to get two candy bags yesterday and managed to get 7 of the 8 needed. Today I didn't get a single bag of candy (though I did get 4 dresses and a picnic basket - which I had from last year). I understand this isn't as bad as the Perma-Peddle achievement, but it's still pretty rotten, especially since every other item needed for the achievement is obtainable in other manners.<br />
<br />
So what am I asking for? Take the achievement out of the meta? Naw. Make it easier to get? Not really. I just felt like bitching for a change. After all, when I finally do get that bag and get the last candy I need, I'll feel special. Not like, &quot;Oh, I'm so awesome!&quot; special, but more of a, &quot;Shit, I'm retarded for spending 12 hours a day for four days doing this,&quot; kinda special.<br />
