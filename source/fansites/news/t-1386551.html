That's my bet. A strong old (well, Iron now) Horde on Draenor would at least slow the Burning Legion down several years.<br />
<br />
Not an 'evil' act, but certainly going to put him and us at odds.</div></div><hr />

I will still play it, because I will keep playing as long as I enjoy the raiding aspect of the game. I didn't like MoP lore much but it was an excellent raiding expansion.

If you listened closely, Tom Chilton might have slipped. Metzen was avoiding saying his name, but Chilton said Kairoz Dormu's involvement helped Garrosh.</div></div><hr />

Outlands was more than enough space and how often do we visit these places once we quest through them, especially with the recent trend of adding a new island with each patch?

seems that way, doesn't it? this just makes Pandaria and WoD look like stall tactics while we wait for the REAL xpacs.<br />

No new races.<br />
No new classes.<br />
SAME bad guy as previous exp<br />
<br />
All we get is a prettier version of outland and some prettier player models. This should be patch 5.41, not 6.0<br />

One of the details, combined with the fact that he doesn't show up in this trailer at all, make me think he'll just be the 'instigator' of the events, not the big baddy himself.</div></div><hr />

For example: we do not know how the events of WoD will affect the Outland content - will it make Outland &quot;disappear&quot; or will it simply be an alternate timeline &quot;in a paradoxical bubble&quot;? We are 15 minutes in to what I assume will be a wave of information that will be washing out for the next three days. Let's not start mourning the death of WoW just yet (just like many of us have for EVERY EXPANSION).</div></div><hr />

As I understand it, it's only for one character. Not terribly egregious.<br />
<br />
Also, to those people who are poo-pooing this expansion without knowing practically anything substantial about it (and making up assumptions on just about everything), please, just unsub quietly. You are the epitome of awful if you think you can translate 5 minutes of talk with alpha footage/stills into a concrete understanding of every facet of the new expansion.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Want to enlighten us how they did this &quot;again&quot;? To use the word again the same thing had to happen previously. Let's review the main villian's fates.<br />
<br />
Arthas/Lich King - Dead<br />
Illidian - Dead<br />
Deathwing - Dead<br />
<br />
Garrosh is the ONLY main villian to &quot;escape like a saturday morning cartoon character&quot; Maybe you could say Ragnaros escaped but he wasn't even the main villian of vanilla, the old god C'Thun was. Way to exaggerate man...</div></div><hr />

Most of this will make it. Dont forget that this expansion is likely to release in 6-9 months. This isnt going to be as long as it has been before because MoP is already on its last raid.<br />

<br />
I can't see the same Outland we did &quot;a few years ago&quot; here. Sure it is techically the same place, but it was made all new from scratch and it is untainted from what we have previously seen, so it is basically a whole new world. It's like &quot;wow so this is like the TBC epicness, but with a new world&quot;, atleast for me and I love it. Also 5 dungs, as far as I can read it's 7 and right on this very newspost. It seems like it's 7 dungeons, AND 2 old ones, or so I understand it.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JoeShmo</div><div class="date">2013-11-08, 09:57 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Want to enlighten us how they did this &quot;again&quot;? To use the word again the same thing had to happen previously. Let's review the main villian's fates.<br />
<br />
Arthas/Lich King - Dead<br />
Illidian - Dead<br />
Deathwing - Dead<br />
<br />
Garrosh is the ONLY main villain to &quot;escape like a saturday morning cartoon character&quot; Maybe you could say Ragnaros escaped but he wasn't even the main villian of vanilla, the old god C'Thun was. Way to exaggerate man...<br />
<br />
Maybe the use of &quot;Main villian&quot; is being used to strictly or liberally, but....Kaelthas was a big character in TBC, and did the run away. ( Hence the joke &quot;Mearly a setback&quot; ) . <br />
<br />
Technically, the lich king lives on, its only arthas's body that was killed. Deathwing has done a few runaways throughout his story. Rag was not a &quot;main villain&quot; in the sense that vanilla wow had NO main villains, hence its creative story was better than traditional &quot;good vs evil&quot; fights. Cthun was certainly not a main villian in regards to the &quot;last boss&quot; of the game period, Kel'Thuzad was in Naxx; before they butchered that content and rehashed it for wrath. Anub'arak did a similar return. Arthas made a spirited getaway during the fight for lights hope. The list goes on for &quot;not main villains&quot;, but major villains non the less.<br />
<br />
If you are going to critisize someone for &quot;exaggerating&quot; , the least you could do is be a bit more correct in your statements, and a bit more specific in what you are trying to get it.</div></div><hr />

im pretty sure 60-70 outlands not gonna change at all and everthing stays, they cant just remove whole expansion, there ll be alternative version of outlands for lvl 91-100 and the old one for 60-70. old outlands cant be removed or you would have huge leveling gap.</div></div><hr />

From what I gather, the difficulties will now be:<br />

Mythic: 20 Players</div></div><hr />

When he said that, he said &quot;Heroic&quot; in the sense that it's the new name for Normal modes. MoP Normal = WoD Heroic, and MoP Heroic = WoD Mythic.<br />
<br />
Him saying &quot;Mythic is harder than Heroic in 2014&quot; is the same thing as saying &quot;Heroic is harder than Normal in 2013&quot;.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;Harder than heroic&quot; in the sense that Normal mode has been rebranded as Heroic in the wake of Flex becoming Normal. It's just the new Heroic mode.</div></div><hr />

If I'm understanding this correctly it sounds great. Really really great. Replacing the shitshow of LFR, Flex, 10N, 25N, 10H, 25H was so necessary.</div></div><hr />

Did they eliminate 10 and 25 man normal and heroic raiding? Is everything going to be flex raiding now? I sure as hell hope not.<br />
<br />
Considering their new Mythic difficulty is 20 max players, im assuming that blizzard is trying to fix the disparity between 10 and 25 mans by just making a single flex system. The choice of 20 for Mythic probably entirely revolves around them trying to make the most difficult and engaging fights for bosses, without having to do that 3x, once for each difficulty.<br />
<br />
On a personal note about the new additions:<br />
<br />
Do we REALLY have to suffer through an even WORSE leveling experience than in MoP? It was bad enough with the small amount of dungeons available, especially while leveling, but now its down to 4 dungeons, 1 of which is a rehash ? They REALLY are trying to spend resources on making sure players feel obligated to keep playing and/or gated indefinitely. Instead of a more enjoyable dungeon experience like in the first 4 iterations of wow, they continue on pooling designers on gimmicky mini-games and repetitive &quot;adventuring&quot; to keep subs flowing.<br />
<br />
Yay..I get to spend 10 levels (really blizzard...we going back to 10 lvls now? ) doing the same 4 dungeons over and over again, 1 of which ive already done to ad-naseum (since i doubt its gong to be changed that drastically from its vanilla version) .<br />
<br />
Heres to hoping the leveling timeframe isnt 2x longer than MoP was, with the extra 5 levels.</div></div><hr />

Deathwing - Dead<br />

Garrosh is the ONLY main villian to &quot;escape like a saturday morning cartoon character&quot; Maybe you could say Ragnaros escaped but he wasn't even the main villian of vanilla, the old god C'Thun was. Way to exaggerate man...<br />

Arthas is dead. Bolvar is the new Lick King. He did so to prevent the undead from over running everyone.<br />
Illidan is dead as we know, but there is the debate on rahter he was more demon or elf. High Demons can only be killed in the Twisting Neather.</div></div><hr />

We don't know if Illidan is dead dead. He pretty much became part Nathrezim, who we know are 99.9% immortal(as were supposed to be KJ and Archimonde...I think) so we don't know if he is reforming in the nether or if he actually died.</div></div><hr />

<br />
As for &quot;the end of 10 and 25 man guilds&quot;, well, didn't the raid structure change before? And guilds adapted?<br />
<br />
I play on mid ( but it more low ) populated realm and No that wont fix anything, it will make it a bit easier to make guild group but you are still left blank spots. I dont give a flying F for FLEX and LFR, something that isnt going to give you a realm experience isnt worth mentioning.<br />
<br />
Yes it did. I played 40man guilds, i did AQ20 and AQ40 when you were using green items with nature ress, but then they changed it so you didnt had to have ress gear ( exept from one boss in Ulduar ). It has been like this for years ( 10man and 25man ) and what they decided? Oh w8 will change a concept that has some flaws to a concept that hasnt been used for 7+ years?</div></div><hr />

<br />
BL is in a different spot from most guilds tho. For them its mostly about drawing the world first race back into a single track. no more 10/25 bullshit. Just 1 mode where the best wins.<br />
<br />
On the down side is what it will do to guilds. Yes BL will just drop the 5 worst players. Its no big deal for them, they already play with the best but for tight 25m guilds they have to drop people they like and played with for years and 10m will suddenly have to double there roster. <br />
<br />
Yes change to raid size has happened before and the raiding scene will survive. I think this will even end up strengthening it by drawing the fractures 10/25 back together but the start of WoD is going to be rough and hundreds of guilds will die in the transition, and i dont just mean die as 2 10 man's are merged but merge and then fail because of any number of reasons.</div></div><hr />
