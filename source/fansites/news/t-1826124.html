Garrison Resource Quest Rewards Hotfix<br />
The Tanaan daily quests and first dungeon daily now reward more Garrison Resources than before! This should help players that are constantly swapping out equipment for Naval Missions. The new rewards are listed below.<br />

<br />
Character Name Release Requests<br />
We often receive requests from players to free up a character name. Customer Support will no longer assist with releasing names. Instead, names will automatically become available if the account that holds the name has remained inactive for the past two expansions.<br />
<br />
For example, if an account has been inactive since before the Cataclysm expansion, all names on that account will be made available when the Warlords of Draenor expansion launches.<br />
<br />
If you are an active player, there is no need to worry that your character names will be changed, even if you have been playing other characters for a while.<br />

Blue Tweets<br />
Timewalking<br />
I think the tuning for Timewalker this week was a little off. Any way the XP gains from it could be nudged up? Barely got any<br />
We’ll be looking at the XP that leveling players receive from Timewalking; we agree it could be more rewarding. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623288763037298688))<br />
<br />
Achievements<br />
Tune-o-Tron micro in the toy box says it needs &quot;More Hit Tunes&quot; achieve but there is no achieve called that<br />
The portable audiophone was accidentally added twice; there is a duplicate entry with an older name and it's fixed in 6.2.1. (WarcraftDevs (https://twitter.com/WarcraftDevs/status/623290072264130560))<br />
<br />
PvP<br />
Remove the Ancient Artifact. It ruins Ashran, especially when it's small scale.<br />
We are going to prevent it from spawning when populations are low. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/623178247438635008))<br />
You're completely missing the point. Populations are ALWAYS LOW, and AA is guaranteed &quot;I win&quot; now<br />
What region are you in and what time do you play? We see low populations at off-peak times but not always. (holinka (https://twitter.com/holinka/status/623230664314261504))<br />

I bet if you and all the others that wanted 'Legacy' servers would start a kickstarter campaign and came up with the money to PAY for it, I bet Blizzard would do it. Then we could see how many are serious about it.</div></div><hr />

Last time I leveled I skipped all of Talador and got 100 half way through Spires of Arak which reduces the amount of resources that I can get unless i waste time and do every quest which is a little redundant if you are trying to get 100 fast.<br />
<br />
Add on top of that trying to lvl up followers while you are leveling.</div></div><hr />

And actually do things how they use to, instead of one raid with four difficulties. It sucks bad. Dare I say open up legacy servers * gasp * nah nobody would play on those, right.<br />
<br />
Wildstar tried that and look how well that went so yes, you're right. Nobody would play on those.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard wont support custom requests that normally could be done every 3rd month after an account has been inactive, instead players request is going to be denied and told to wait 2+ years? A little over the top, I think.<br />

Thanks for abusing the GMs for releasing names.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Not really abuse, it is a common task they have done for years. If a name has gone inactive (3 months after last pay), then you can without any complaint, request the name released. Not abuse, a service.<br />
<br />
Else, I guess you called the all restore request abuse as well? Or other such mundane tasks as back in the day of getting your character restored, etc?<br />
<br />
GM support beyond complaints are abuse to you?</div></div><hr />

Name changes were probably getting out of control lately, yeah. They're also pretty much hands off with loot matters, but that's not as big of an issue with more players using personal loot.</div></div><hr />

3 months to release a name? Yeah, right, because we don't get 1 year + of the same content that makes people leave the game until next xpac...</div></div><hr />

<br />
Someone didn't understand what was written. I mentioned the 3 months because they is normally the deadline AFTER an account goes inactive, where you could request a name unlocked. Content has nothing to do with the names or GM's. And sorry, account inactive + three months, then it is fair game really to people who can use them.<br />
<br />
Currently, fair and permitted, I've had 6 names unlocked from inactive users - nothing wrong with that.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tesuque</div><div class="date">2015-07-27, 01:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That's a bummer on the name changing. It wasn't based on accounts being inactive, it was based on that particular character being inactive. So someone could have the name you want, play other characters and that name never is seen on your server. Blizzard will never release it now because someone is playing their account? This is a cutback in customer service - perhaps there is a happy medium and they could charge money IF the character has been inactive, just as they do with other character services?<br />
<br />
Blizzard, please consider. This new policy seems a bit harsh.</div></div><hr />

We have a chance of our name being taken? If so thats bloody stupid, I mean a lot of people quit and come back if thats a huge IF content is good again. Who the hell would want to come back with their name that they have used for 5+ years taken because some asshole wanted to steal it from you just for the hell of it. <br />
<br />
Blizzard that sounds to me that you guys are firing people and wanting to make everything auto so cost becomes lower. Yet you make billions a year. Blizzard you are going to fall on your face soon. BTW Elder Scrolls is damn amazing compared to Wow these days.</div></div><hr />

No, you need to have not logged in for two entire expansions, so that's more like 4 years offline, not 1, before your name is at risk.</div></div><hr />

I had someone jack a name holder from me (I didn't notice it for like 6 months) and then put in a ticket and got my name back. It was funny getting whispers from active raiders and shit haha. I'm not active on that server, so it's still rather funny.</div></div><hr />

Best guess would be very, VERY few.</div></div><hr />

Last time I leveled I skipped all of Talador and got 100 half way through Spires of Arak which reduces the amount of resources that I can get unless i waste time and do every quest which is a little redundant if you are trying to get 100 fast.<br />
<br />
Add on top of that trying to lvl up followers while you are leveling.<br />
<br />
This so much, especially considering you need a lv3 Garrison to start Tanaan. Every time I had considered leveling one of my alts to 100 I got discouraged because of all the stuff you need to do to get up and running, but I made myself do it recently on my Druid. Ugh, not doing that again this xpack. All I do is log in to collect GR because it's such a drag to even think about that character I can't bring myself to farm rares at 10-15GR a pop when I know I'm going to need like 20k all told. All my followers are level 90-93. My buildings are all level 1. Maybe these changes will make it tolerable.</div></div><hr />

Probably because they want the GMs to fokus on acutal game issues and cutting the queues.</div></div><hr />

If resource gathering during faster levelling is the issue, why not add the lumber mill to alt garrisons? You could supplement resource collection by snagging trees in whatever zone you happen to be in.</div></div><hr />
