<br />
&quot;doesn't hold your hand&quot;?<br />
<br />
I'd say it definitely holds your hand as much as other MMOs in terms of QoL. I mean even the buttons for abilities flash when you use them. <br />
<br />
And &quot;intricate and satisfying&quot;? Literally most melee is just &quot;push this button combination in a specific order while using buffs&quot;. Class playstyle is exactly the same as WoWs.

I don't agree with the hand holding. The lower levels are indeed pretty boring, with your rotation mostly consisting of 1-3 abilities over and over, but once you hit 60+ the rotation for the classes picks up a LOT, the least complex class in FFXIV is still more complex than the most complex class in WoW by far.<br />
<br />
You can fuck up in some mythic raids in WoW and still recover if you play accordingly, in FFXIV it seems if you make a mistake in an Ex, you're not recovering.<br />

Nah in EXs you get 1 maybe 2 small chances. Savage raids maybe one tiny chance.<br />

You can recover in Savage/EX. It's just harder to. Ultimate is very very very hard if nigh impossible to recover from.</div></div><hr />

<br />
And more stuff to do is very subjective. I'd say both games are fairly even with what they offer in terms of content.<br />
<br />
I dunno, I've played World of Warcraft since Vanilla (Though I did unsub a couple months ago.) And when I started getting up there in levels, I began to realize something. &quot;One hotbar is not enough.&quot; I could raid mythic in WoW with no more than 1 hotbar's worth of abilities / spells. &quot;Rotations&quot; on most classes consists of what...? 5 abilities? They all play virtually the same. Build your resource, spend your resource. Build your combo points, spend your combo points and that's it. <br />
<br />
I began my adventure in FF XIV as an archer. It was very simple, very easy for a long while, but once I got up in the higher levels, towards 60, I had so many buttons to press, buffs to keep track of and debuffs to maintain, that I wasn't sure what the fuck i was doing, and it was fun... Legit fun. While the classes aren't rocket science to play, its still much more engaging, than picking a class in WoW, hit max level and then realize &quot;This is my rotation; Filler, filler, filler spend, filler filler, procc, spend, filler, filler, spend.&quot; On the bard, I was weaving in instant casts, songs (AoE Buffs.) And keeping track of dots, cooldowns and proccs. <br />
<br />
As for content. Yes, it is subjective, but, the content FF XIV offers, outside of dungeons / raid is a lot engaging, than the nothingness offered by WoW. Professions? They're treated as full fledged classes, with its own gear, spells, abilities and depth. In WoW? Click &quot;Craft.&quot; Player housing? In FF XIV you can buy your own house (Small, medium, large) And decorate it as you see fit. In WoW? I dunno, we had garrisons? Golden Saucer vs Darkmoon Faire? Golden Saucer is up all the time, it has minigames, cycles events, has a weekly transmog riddle, a lottery, a card game and an RTS styled pet battle system.<br />
<br />
Then lets talk about the RP side of things. in WoW, you have a static amount of emotes, and one dance per race. In final fantasy, you have a huge amount of emotes and even facial expressions, you can unlock more in quests, you can unlock more dances, you can unlock more hairstyles. And speaking of hairstyles, the character customization, while not perfect, is also a lot more free in FF XIV than it is in WoW.<br />
<br />
So sure, they might be fairly even in the amount of content they offer, but if you put the Garrison on the same level as player housing, I'm gonna gag :p</div></div><hr />

Because classes don't need nerfed, some need buffed, no class is over performing to the point of needed nerfed outside the hotfixes. Some traits are trash, and some fight mechanics favor certain classes, the fact they're gutting some specs, forcing you to take a different spec to compete on meters, specs that require traits and trinkets to perform well is stupid. Making people have to refarm crap they don't want to refarm, from content they don't want to keep doing. Yeah, plenty to be upset about, I don't care what type of player Ion describes, he needs to realize people getting fed up with that crap.</div></div><hr />

And that´s why they nerfed the pet damage, the IS trait and now another 5-7% nerf ....<br />
Aflicction is only useful in ST, AOe is bad as fuck (middle of the low pack in m+), they even nerfed demonology wich is<br />
one of the worst spec in the game.<br />
There are 3-4 specs better than aflicction right now, and they seems untouched, so wtf man, the assa rogue is op en cleave, st and aoe, aflicction is only in ST.<br />

Yup. They're going to try something new and let people enter mythic dungeons solo(or duo). Not sure if they'll bump it up to mythic+ in the future. The dungeons will scale to the amount of players and will be very challenging. It'll be like mage tower but harder since this will scale. No idea if they'll reward gear but I'd assume they will.</div></div><hr />

Thanks Ion, we warned you in alpha, beta and 8.0. Now its 8.1 and you haven’t done jack shit to rectify the problems dps shsmans are facing, is all you do is talk word salad?<br />
<br />
With this guy in charge why do people keep paying for this product he never just shat on the shaman playerbase he just shat on the entire community and yes this is my first time seeing it he comes off as a total prick.</div></div><hr />

<br />
sad but true.<br />
<br />
even when i like a lot in BfA (and i do) and dont want to jump on the shitstorm train, sooo many classes are sooo boring. <br />
<br />
sub is boring, ret is boring as hell, ele is boring, bm is boring, prot warrior is boring, heal druid is boring... and and and. i leveled 7 classes and played around 16-17 specs for a bit dungeons and WQs overall. and around 85% of them feel tough as chewingum. its like walking through deep mud. slow, clunky, unfinished.<br />
<br />
wow lives a GREAT degree through the classes, since the class mechanics is your bread and butter. you use it always. for everything you do. its a very big part of the identification of the game. you can dislike a raid. dont do it. or hope for the next. you can dislike a talent. dont use it. but when you dislike how your whole class feels, or most of all others, you are in serious trouble, because you have to use it ALWAYS. its not good what blizz did here. <br />
<br />
i do not hate much in BfA (unlike many others here), but the class design and the further pruning is just horrible.<br />
<br />
PS:<br />
and as a side note. they promised (blue posted and officially eta) ppl that elemental and SP will get a overhaul with 8.1 because they couldnt managed them timewise before release. they said it. they promised it. and now they did NOTHING (beside some number tweaks). are they thinking ppl are that stupid and forget that fast ? or wtf ?</div></div><hr />

<br />
You playing another game mate ?<br />
<br />
Yeah the numbers were teaked but that changes nothing about the gameplay and gameplay still sucks, not just for ele, enhancement and shadow.<br />
<br />
Elemental got 3 new talents and if we are lucky we can use one of them.<br />
<br />
Enhancement and shadow only got number tweaks, thats not even close to a rework they promised before BFA came out.<br />
<br />
In case you havent noticed: BFA sucks and blizzard does nothing to change that. Nobody cares about new content if the gameplay is crap.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kralljin</div><div class="date">2018-12-01, 03:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">You really sound like a person ion describes tho, there been tons of buffs and reworks to talents and such in the last few patches<br />
<br />
They buffed Ele and Enhancement once so far.<br />
<br />
Second, Ion clearly stated before BfA release that they are looking for mechanical fixes that require a patch and are looking at 8.1 for these.<br />
Also he said during the Reddit AMA and Ele and Enhance clearly lack any strength / niche and they have to do work there.<br />
<br />
The result?<br />
Enhancement receives talent balance (just numbers, nothing else), which doesn't do shit in the grand scheme of things as basically every talent does the same thing nowadays.<br />
<br />
Elemental receives new two new talents , the only promising one becomes next to useless outside of pure ST fights.<br />
<br />
So far, neither Enhancement nor Elemental receives flat out buffs on the PTR.<br />
<br />
<br />
On the one hand, Ion clearly admits that both Elemental and Enhancement aren't in a good state, on the other he blames the community that they react in a negatively manner towards specs that are clearly in an unfinished state.<br />
<br />
Who cares if Elemental and Enhancement are just 2-3% behind in a Patchwerk fight? <br />
There are fights and situations where Dps Shaman just aren't good due lack of mobility and defense, without any strengths to make that up, that is not a good design, the difference here isn't &quot;just 2-3%&quot;<br />
<br />
The numbers aren't the core issue, the issue is that both Enhancement and Elemental are simply inferior versions of other classes / specs in PvE with no upside.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
To add to that none of the ele changes adresses the core issue with the class - choice between movement or survivability. At the moment ele has neither. And most of the fights are heavy on the movement, which makes ele do shit dps or gamble with death trying to cast.<br />
<br />
What do we want?<br />
<br />
<br />
Talents and spells<br />
<br />
<br />
* Echo (and EB) should be baseline <br />
* spell cast times are very high for elemental, especially at the start of each addon. Not untill we get around 20-30% haste can we talk about some mid of the pack damage. This especially shows in conjunction with high movement\avoiding mechanics<br />
* Legion gloves should be added to Ascendance talent<br />
* If elemental is supposed to be a low mobility class - give us something to survive. Baseline avoidance comes to mind. More active CDs. Maybe a stance that roots\slows us, but grounds part of aoe damage and makes us immune to knockback. Sort of grounding totem\pillar of frost effect. With the animation of that debuff from halls of lightning https://wowimg.zamimg.com/uploads/guide/images/7836.jpg<br />
* Stormkeeper should be baseline and 3charges so we can start with some maelstrom<br />
* Bring back Lightning rod<br />
* Remove FS cd<br />
<br />
Cosmetics:<br />
<br />
<br />
* If you want Lightning bolt to feel powerfull change it's animation to Crash Lightning\Lightning rod proc https://media.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2016/march/crashLightning.jpg and reverse the animation of &quot;CastStrongUpRight&quot; and &quot;CastStrongUpLeft&quot; so the shaman reaches for the sky and pulls a bolt down. Like this https://im5.ezgif.com/tmp/ezgif-5-5b57528158f6.gif<br />
<br />
* Earth Shock animation should have an upgrade. For a main nuke the little durt thud looks ridiculous</div></div><hr />

Seriously, this just reinforces the idea that BfA 8.0 is just a paid beta. Why can't we have those items at release? Why do certain professions have to wait months for a patch to bring in craftable items that other professions already have??<br />

Very interesting claim. Have any proof of this &quot;flood&quot;? I know! Let's go look up the Warrior for one of the undisputed best raid tanks in the world. Surely THE world first tank would be getting his warrior geared if this were true...<br />

In Legion, there was (and still is) a quest of sorts to unlock Fenryr (tameable) for a Hunter. Hall of Valor MUST be soloed on Mythic only; not the entire thing, but you have to solo kill Heimdall and Fenryr. If even one other player is in the group, it will not work. Was a fun challenge.<br />
