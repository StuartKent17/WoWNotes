Legion - Dalaran Portals<br />
In Legion, Dalaran has a large assortment of portals. The old portals from Wrath of the Lich King are back, along with some new ones! <br />
<br />
Horde have portals to Orgrimmar, Undercity, Thunder Bluff, Silvermoon, and Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Alliance have portals to Stormwind, Ironforge, Darnassus, Exodar, and Vale of the Eternal Blossoms. <br />
<br />
Both factions have access to portals in the new structure in the center of Dalaran. These are currently used for Artifact intro quest teleports, leading to Caverns of Time, Shattrath, Wyrmrest Temple, Dalaran Crater, and Karazhan. <br />

Ghostcrawler Tweets<br />
Ghostcrawler still occasionally talks about WoW. Remember that he no longer works for or speaks for Blizzard.<br />
In your opinion, is a huge beta like the one in MoP better than the a relatively smaller one like in Cata?(number of testers)<br />
Depends on the goal: quality of feedback? Relationship with the testers? Stress testing? Build I got media hype? (OccupyGStreet (https://twitter.com/OccupyGStreet/status/688090090032136192))<br />

I'm guessing you've never played a healer have you?<br />
<br />
Healers have a 8 seconds cooldown on dispel nowadays. You can only dispel 2 people max unless you're a Priest.<br />
<br />
I had some twat moaning at me because I couldn't dispel everyone on my resto druid. I pre warned them to jump the ability. I had him linking me his Hand of A'dal achievement cos I told him he was an idiot lol.<br />

It's a good change for random groups.</div></div><hr />

He's probably confusing it for Cataclysm, when Blizzard removed every last portal from Northrend Dalaran. (They later re-added a portal to Stormwind / Orgrimmar for returning players.)</div></div><hr />

Or people could learn to jump. Jumping at the end of the Static Cling cast will make it not effect you at all.<br />
There's even a whole achievement around it: No Static At All (http://www.wowhead.com/achievement=5288/no-static-at-all).<br />
But it's easy to blame it on the healer, whom -in most cases- can only dispel once every 8 seconds.</div></div><hr />

No, that's called a good healer. Not sucking would mean you can actually jump at the right time, not hard.</div></div><hr />

I think its more reference to pulling fahralon or whatever it was called that happened in wod, otherwise you could say 'They pulled a wotlk' (or maybe it was just before or during cata cant remember) if you all remember they took out the portals in dalaran and everyone cried.</div></div><hr />

I hate this. I really hate stuff like this. Here we have a very easily avoidable mechanic (just press the SPACEBAR key to jump!) and instead of letting players learn how to do this, no, let's make a very-easy-to-handle mechanic, and make it into a super-pathetically-easy-to-handle-and-maybe-even-completely-forgettable mechanic.</div></div><hr />

My favorite part was when you said you don't suck at the game and then proceeded to tell everyone that you don't do a mechanic properly. You're totally not a scrub.<br />

You are the prime example of the kind of player that is causing the 'dumbing down' of the game, by not doing fight mechanics properly, forcing others to save you lest you complain that it's their fault when they don't save you, and demanding Blizzard nerf those mechanics, and now you boast that you 'don't suck' at the game because you can ignore a mechanic and still live.<br />
<br />
HINT: ignoring a mechanic and still living is not called 'not sucking', it's called 'being lucky'. 'Not sucking' would mean doing the mechanics properly.</div></div><hr />

<br />
first off i was the tank dillhole and ive solo'd every timewalker bossfight while my group got itself killed, theres no luck involved when the ability he does after the cling does jack shit to you and it wears off way before the triangle thing finishes. its called knowing how to work around it, any class can do that. im not the reason they dumb things down, they dumb things down cause everyone complains where as i dont, i always figure out a work around and overcome the barrier not cry about it. i loved cata when it first started out, everything hit hard, punished you for being stupid, and rewarded you when you weren't, cata was at its prime when it was first around, then blizzard gave in to the constant crybabies and thats when WoW went downhill sadly. i still play and love the game but i do miss that feeling i had when cata first launch, actually needing to care about certain trash mobs, making sure you didnt overpull. you just dont get the feeling of &quot;oh shit i should pan my camera out and look around before i pull&quot; or look at cast bars or any of that anymore when you play currently, its just pewpew and win in dungeons, yes challenge modes are supposed to be a remedy to that but the challenge was better when it was in the basic content and not volunteer content, but yeah if the useless cling couldve got me killed obviously i wouldve jumped so i didnt get it, but the cling doesnt do crap, the boss does crap all damage so there wasnt a need to thus my statement, if youre wiping on timewalker dungeons youre just sad period and either need to practice your class more or just stop playing with random people cause you're just going to cause a lot of frustration for others when they don't need it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you've solo'd EVERY boss fight while your group died, there's a problem... See, the tank is supposed to AGGRO everything and take all the damage so everyone else can STAY ALIVE and heal you or dps the mobs. Clearly you must suck at tanking. You keep telling us how much you don't suck, then giving us examples of what not to do. I'm not sure that word means what you think it does.</div></div><hr />

<br />
So standing in the completely avoidable damage just because you know you can survive it is considered not sucking at the game? Apparently we need more in game reminders that standing in bad is bad.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I suspect they meant Blizzard would remove the portals just before launch as they did with other elements of WoD. WoD was fraught with overhyped elements to entice expansion and sub purchases and then those elements were taken out for endlessly vague reasons.</div></div><hr />

<br />
&quot;It didn't make sense&quot; became the catch all phrase from the devs when ask about why X was taken out or &quot;not enough time.&quot; Both may be true but it's still incredibly lame especially considering the expansion as a whole.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I've always wondered - why does MMOchamp almost always list Horde before Alliance? &quot;A&quot; is before &quot;H&quot;, and unless there is an overwhelming majority of Horde players over Alliance in general, why the blatant Ally-Discrimination? Anytime there is a potential for strained relations between two sides - you would go with the safe diplomatic route of listing things alphabetically. But nope. Not here.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am one of your biggest fan and Moral supporter!<br />
<br />
But we have to stop making all those Statick portals that takes you everywhere (WE are playing WORLD of warcraft!!!! not PORTALS of Warcraft) An Adventure is 50% part Travelling, with all these portals we are just popping all other the place. <br />
<br />
Let us use Flight paths and SHIPS or some other way of transportation, in which we have to do some walking/riding our selfs, not just turn around the corner in the &quot;main city&quot; and click on a portal (How about you can make some major Ship Ports that has Common/Faction Transport Ships) these will make players meet up to wait for the ship and become a place to socialize.<br />
<br />
A solution would be to just keep the portals in the portal room underneath dalaran, and I would like to make 2 or 3 NPC mages stand in that room that you could talk to and ask them to open a portal, then they would walkover to the portal spot (maybe there would be some charged crytals, Since opening a portals is no easy task) and then they would open a portal and stay channeling for some minutes, this would also let other players use that portal, but sometimes all the 3 mages are busy and people would have to wait and maybe that could make people socialize.<br />
<br />
But please remove the City portals in the Faction Districs... we need to get out more and travel.... I miss the days in Vanilla where we had to travel EVERYWHeRE and during the trip you would find out many new things about the world...<br />
<br />
PS: In Vanilla I made many of my friend start playing by only telling them how big the world was and that it took over 1-2 Hours to walk from one part of the word to another.<br />
<br />
PSS: and if PEOPLE SAY I dont have TIME to travel, then you dont understand what an MMO Fantasy adventeure game is.<br />
<br />
Thanks For understanding.<br />
Truly yours... Wolfrick</div></div><hr />
