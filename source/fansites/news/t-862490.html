From Eurogamer (http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2011-03-04-firelands-raid-will-not-be-in-wow-patch-4-1)<br />
Blizzard has told Eurogamer that the Firelands raid – the next tier of endgame raiding progression for the MMO – will not appear in the next patch, 4.1, as it had previously planned. <br />
<br />
In an interview at the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco, lead producer J. Allen Brack said that players were not sufficiently advanced through the raid content that shipped with third expansion Cataclysm in December to handle the challenge of Firelands. He also suggested that Blizzard was thinking of creating &quot;smaller&quot; content patches for World of Warcraft. <br />
<br />
&quot;We feel like the player base isn't really ready for the next raid yet,&quot; he said. &quot;And that led to some changes where Firelands is now actually going to be in 4.2.&quot; <br />
<br />
&quot;Our plan is to package... features into smaller content updates and to release them as soon as possible, rather than wait and release larger updates more infrequently,&quot; Blizzard added in a statement. <br />
<br />
[...]After the interview, Blizzard gave Eurogamer the following statement about the decision to remove Firelands from patch 4.1. <br />
The decision to move Firelands to 4.2 was also motivated by a desire to move away from the &quot;monolithic&quot; content patches World of Warcraft has received recently, towards smaller updates, Brack said. <br />
<br />
&quot;Patch 4.1 provides our players with access to the completely redesigned Zul'Aman and Zul'Gurub five-player dungeons, where they'll be able to experience challenging encounters featuring all-new boss mechanics, obtain updated epic-level loot, and possibly acquire rare mounts.<br />
<br />
&quot;One of our long-standing development goals is to release regular content updates for the community to enjoy. These updates are generally focused on introducing specific content, like a new raid or new gameplay features.<br />
<br />
&quot;Our plan is to package these features into smaller content updates and to release them as soon as possible, rather than wait and release larger updates more infrequently.<br />
<br />
&quot;The previously announced Firelands raid will be part of content update 4.2 which should come soon after 4.1.<br />

Efflorescence (http://db.mmo-champion.com/s/81275/efflorescence/) has been redesigned.

This periodic effect now also benefits from spell haste, but the individual ticks cannot be critical effects.<br />

<br />
Is your whole guild decked out already? If not thats pretty selfish. They are holding it back because the majority of the players that raid, have not finished the content, and dont want to release new content that has gear that will easily trump current difficult content. Dont like it, then take your little break, but I am sure your guild wont love you for it.<br />
<br />
I am willing to bet the majority of you that think this is a silly decision have not even fully experienced the current raids. Stupid, silly, idiotic Blizzard? No, I say thoughtless, simple minded, slow players for asking for more than what they can currently handle. <br />
<br />
Not to mention it gives them more time to create a more epic encounter, than what is already started.</div></div><hr />

<br />
No.<br />
<br />
This was the case in Wrath. Blizzard has moved away from this model, and heroic encounters are now a part of the natural progression.<br />
<br />
Translation: You are intended to clear the current content, or at the very least advance to the final tier before moving on to the next piece of raid content.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Tablemaker</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 01:25 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Two years ago... Four years ago... people griped about having to wait long periods of time to get new content. Now, Blizzard are deciding to do just that, people are going to go bananas on them. Firelands was being pushed back anyway, irregardless of their new stance on content releasing. So that meant 4.1 would have took longer. Instead, they are going to push out 4.1 faster, give us the new changes, bug fixes and &quot;smaller&quot; content with the raid to follow shortly after. Given that, we will probably see another heroic content patch (4.3) before we get the new COT... and another heroic content patch before we see Deathwing... making it like 4.7.<br />

Most ppl can barely run through a heroic dungeon to get gear for the 1st tier of raids, Tier 2 will have to w8 until ppl L2P<br />

At that rate the next expansion will be released around 2022.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I am willing to bet the majority of you that think this is a silly decision have not even fully experienced the current raids. Stupid, silly, idiotic Blizzard? No, I say thoughtless, simple minded, slow players for asking for more than what they can currently handle. <br />
<br />
Not to mention it gives them more time to create a more epic encounter, than what is already started.<br />

I agree with him though. Fuck this game. We just came out of t10, where we were in ICC for a whole year without anything new (Halion does not count). Now the next tier, for a while it seemed like t12 would be out in 4.1 this May~, but now, it's not. If 4.1 is around 2 months away that would make it May, and so 4.2 would be AT LEAST 3-4 months after that, making it September/October.<br />
<br />
Best way to solve burn out and attrition? Blizzard's answer is to NOT ADD NEW RAID CONTENT, let's let everyone farm the same bosses for several more months! Really, this is just, annoying. I know I'm not 13/13, but damn, I know I'll be sick of seeing Sinestra dead on the floor several times over by the time Firelands should've been out, just as much as I was sick of seeing LK dead.</div></div><hr />

Why should someone have to full clear heroics in order to move onto the next tier of raiding? A lot of people wont be able to, or dont even want to do heroic raids.<br />

This was the case in Wrath. Blizzard has moved away from this model, and heroic encounters are now a part of the natural progression.<br />
<br />
Translation: You are intended to clear the current content, or at the very least advance to the final tier before moving on to the next piece of raid content.<br />
<br />
Considering the difficulty of the content at this moment (without nerfs), I highly doubt the majority of players will have the chance to do just that.

They said they were planning on adding more content faster. Unlike the original system. Like maybe instead of being 4.4 or 4.3, we could get up to 4.8 or 4.9. This gives players more content to do, but putting it out faster. And this gives Blizzard the chance to really make Firelands a GREAT raid. All I see anymore is whining and bitching, and quite frankly I'm sick of it. They put they're time and effort into giving players time to gear up, when, SHOCKING, a ton of players haven't killed Cho'gall or Nefarian, let alone Sintharia/Sinestra. Guilds are still gearing up and raiding, working on downing these bosses.<br />
<br />
Just because a select .2% of the population has killed 13/13, doesn't giving them higher priority on content. 4.1 is giving us 2(Possibly 3) new 5-mans, and who knows what else Blizzard has planned. This game has turned into nothing but a whine fest, &quot;My DPS sucks!&quot; &quot;My class sucks in PvP!&quot; &quot;Blizzard isn't putting out enough content!&quot; &quot;Blizzard is putting out too much content!&quot; &quot;This tree does not have leaves!&quot;. I know people have their opinions, but when it comes to whining about anything and everything, calling it the downfall of Blizzard, and canceling their subscription(Let's face it, most of you will come back sooner or later). <br />
<br />
I for one like this decision, it gives my guild more time to clear content, and it let's Blizzard put out BETTER content when it IS out. <br />

Do you also often read half a book and then throw it aside and start a new one? Sounds retarded doesn't it? Blizzard knows that most people want to finish their tiers, so that's what they're going to do. I also wish they make Firelands so hard that people with regular mode gear won't be able to complete it. That'll keep half assed people away from the quality content.</div></div><hr />

<br />
If there are people who are still doing heroic 5mans 3 months after content came out, then they don't really care about raiding. Yes, I know the common mantra, &quot;I have a full-time job&quot; &quot;I have a family to take care of&quot;, okay that's great, but then why should you care about killing things while they are current? If you are the type of player who only plays 5-6 hours a week, then clearing all raid bosses while it's current shouldn't really be a concern for you. News just in, when a new raid is released, the old one isn't removed. Hell, it'd make it EASIER for the casual guilds to complete t11 content with bits of t12 gear. What's the difference if you clear it now or later?</div></div><hr />

It doesn't make sense even by their own reasoning. I feel like they're trying to see what they can &quot;get away with&quot; at this point. It's less content per time any way you look at it.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Most of the playerbase was well into raiding during WOTLK. There's no reason that can't happen with Cataclysm; players just need more time to gear and familiarize themselves to encounters. It's unfortunate to all you mega-awesome pro players out there, but most of the playerbase isn't as good as you nor as dedicated.<br />

While this is upsetting to a lot of people if I am right about the release timetable postponing this an extra month might help prevent a year of a content patch as what happened with ICC. Arguably TotC was released too soon in addition to the fact that TotC/ToGC was cleared rather quickly by a large amount of people creating a demand for ICC's release creating the issue so many people have with the duration of the ICC patch.</div></div><hr />

Basically this. People are still doing heroic DUNGEONS and not even in raids yet. 33 guilds, like I said before, have actually seen all that 4.0 has to offer. I think it's fair to push off the next tier a little.<br />

And if you read the article Blizzard said that they are moving AWAY from huge irregular patches. Don't assume Firelands will only be 10 months away. It's probably not gonna be TOO long after 4.1...<br />

I refuse to believe that the majority of people are still gearing up in 5 mans. Are these people playing once a week or something?<br />
<br />
Sorry, I meant to edit &quot;and started raiding.&quot; <br />
<br />
This is kind of what I've observed on a lot of servers. This game is dominated by casuals now who aren't as dedicated as 90% of the posters on these forums. <br />
<br />
Anyway, it's not like it's a total dry spell from now until 4.2... you've got two pretty substantial 5-mans coming in 4.1 which are huge in length.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Oh, and yeah, some people do have these things called jobs, or go these places called schools or universities. We don't have every day/night freed up to ourselves, if not a week. It's the curse of being decently successful in life, or aspiring to.</div></div><hr />

While this is upsetting to a lot of people if I am right about the release timetable postponing this an extra month might help prevent a year of a content patch as what happened with ICC because arguably TotC was released too soon in addition to the fact that TotC/ToGC was cleared rather quickly by a large amount of people creating a demand for ICC's release didn't help in that situation.<br />

Why balance content timing around someone who is playing once a week?<br />
<br />
Given how long content lasts (4 to 6 months usually), they'll still realistically see it/clear some of it before it becomes completely irrelevant. <br />
<br />
This ain't WotLK anymore; it's more TBC style of raiding -- every tier was attractive, difficulty barred. Blizzard has become a lot better at gauging and implementing difficulty so this TBC issue wouldn't plague Cataclysm. <br />
<br />
This change is stupid, but from what i understand it makes no difference in the long run. Unfortunately, this is a rough time for Blizzard and this decision _on the surface_ looks very, VERY bad.</div></div><hr />

things get boring.. you cant raid all the time.<br />
<br />
You don't get the point. <br />
<br />
The point is that people are asking for more content, before they've actually finished what's available to them.<br />
<br />
Imagine this. You buy me a milkshake. I drink half of it, then I ask you, &quot;Can I have another milkshake?&quot; After you then give me another milkshake, I leave the first one alone and never touch it again.<br />

Four years ago... people griped about having to wait long periods of time to get new content. Now, Blizzard are deciding to do just that, people are going to go bananas on them. Firelands was being pushed back anyway, irregardless of their new stance on content releasing. So that meant 4.1 would have took longer. Instead, they are going to push out 4.1 faster, give us the new changes, bug fixes and &quot;smaller&quot; content with the raid to follow shortly after. Given that, we will probably see another heroic content patch (4.3) before we get the new COT... and another heroic content patch before we see Deathwing... making it like 4.7.<br />

I see nothing wrong with this.<br />

There are those players with full time jobs and other obligations that stop them from joining a decent raiding guild, and there are those players that are in decent raiding guilds. Those people with other obligations surely know that they don't expect to finish all content while it is current, that is ridiculous if that's Blizzard's intentions. After all the 4hour/4day raiding guilds complete all the content and have it on farm for several months, we have to wait for all the casual guilds to catch up and finish everything?<br />
<br />
Why do you care if you kill things while it is current or not? Why is this on your priority, assuming you really do have a full-time job/family to take care of? People still raided Naxx in Ulduar and Ulduar in ToC, and ToC in ICC. Why would Cata be any different?</div></div><hr />

They built the Rag fight around the the fact that he was going to have legs, (He was movable). After they released the pic of new Rag with legs there was such a backlash from people hating it that they had to pull the plug on Rag with legs and had to reform the fight so that Rag would not have to move, they could not get to up in time so they are just saying &quot;Fuck it just push Firelands back to 4.2, we will fix this later&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think this is where blizzard is geteting at... 4.1 would have originally been released after full testings on fireland raids in the old every .x patch with dungeons AND raid model, but now they can release 4.1 whenever they are ready to do so and release firelands later when they are ready with that. I dont think this makes releasing firelands any later than it would have.<br />
<br />
With this change we can see ZA/ZG sooner.<br />
<br />
EDIT: Just because firelands will be released with 4.2 it doesn't mean 4.2 will come 4-6 months after 4.1. The patch will come when its ready regardless of the previous patch lasted.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Maybe the content isn't the same as WOTLK, but the playerbase has changed dramatically from TBC to Cata. WOTLK promoted a casual style of play and rewarded it well. So casuals do make up a majority of the playerbase now, and the fact is that about 70% of players in WoW right now haven't killed every single raiding boss right now in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
And anyway, you're still gonna get Firelands, it's not like Blizzard is canning the damn thing. Maybe I'm misquoting this, but Shigeru Miyamoto once said &quot;nobody remembers that a good game took a long time to come out, but everyone remembers a bad game.&quot; The same thing can apply to content.</div></div><hr />

Eh fuck this. I was hoping the Firelands raid would make this game fun again, Cata has been terrible for raiding so far, and now we are getting our content delayed and delayed.

We farm ICC for 1 year, and then we farm the next tier for 9-10 months? I'm so sick of this game.<br />
Then quit. No one is forcing you to play this game.<br />

Absolutely. There's enough repetition to the game as it is without them making it worse.<br />

<br />
Just looking at my server, not a single guild is even close to killing all hard modes at the moment. My guild is semi-casual and have cleared 10/12 normal modes, which on my server is quite good compared to most guilds.<br />
<br />
I would gladly see the current tier go on for at least another 3 months. It is much harder than ICC (my guild cleared all of it on 10-man HC and got 11/12 25 HC) and it is good that they don't rush out new content just to satisfy the small minority who have cleared all of the current Heroic modes.</div></div><hr />

I hope you do realize that a major part of the player base have not cleared all content yet, not even on normal. <br />
<br />
Our guild is a VERY casual rading guild but I think we have maked progress quite fast anyways, we can only play for 1-2 times a week, sometimes some of us can't play at all. We currently have Nefarian and Al'Akir left, then we are moving into heroics. (10man)<br />
<br />
This change was a very good decision by Blizzard, If you wanna be hardcore and plow through the raids thats fine, but you can't demand new content just because your guild and maby 30 more in EU have cleared the content already. This game is for everyone.<br />
<br />

All of the guilds who have cleared this tier of raiding play the game RELIGIOUSLY and dedicate themselves to it. Average people with jobs, school, a social life, or families can't spend every night playing this game, and even if they can, they can't invest 5 hours a day into it. <br />
<br />
Just be patient and wait for others to catch up if you really have cleared all the content thus far.

<br />
I'm sorry to break it, but the majority of people don't have 20 hours a week to spend on this game.<br />
Neither do I. I suck at raiding. I haven't cleared much and I don't plan on clearing much. That doesn't mean I'm not ready for new content. Naming something that isn't going to happen as an excuse is silly. &quot;Let's wait until the people that don't raid are comfortable doing Heroics&quot;. It's hard for a reason. If that poses a problem then they need to retune the difficulty, not chalk it up to time management at our expense. For them to translate it into a matter of time is a terrible red herring, it's a smokescreen for the real issue: they're releasing less content over time.<br />
<br />

<br />
Casuals know their place, stop trying to defend for them. They know that they shouldn't expect to clear 13/13 HM while it's current, why would they even care to do so? If your goal is to just see all the content, then 12/12 is fine. Anyone should be able to get 12/12 by ~May, and if you don't, then that's just because you didn't try to do it. Why should we wait another 2-3-4 months for 4.2 AFTER 4.1 before we get a new raid?</div></div><hr />

While this is true, if they want everyone to see all of Cataclysm's entry tier raid in both their forms (regular/heroic), we'll be waiting till Christmas. You just don't tune things like that.<br />
<br />
Fortunately, from my understand, that isn't what Blizzard is doing AT ALL. They aren't pushing anything back. They're giving us the 2 dungeons early, and the Firelands is going to be released whenever it was going to be released. Still, their timing to make this scheduling change, even though it's actually a positive, couldn't have been any worse. <br />
<br />
As you yourself said (paraphrasing): people will always remember the half-empty glass, or the bad game. This is the twist that will be on people's minds: &quot;Firelands got pushed back&quot;, not &quot;Zul Gurub and Zul Aman early :D!&quot;</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's how you measure a player's ability in a game? By his performance in heroic content / high level Arena? This is an MMORPG where people don't often have the time to spend an entire evening sitting on their computer and improving their tactics on a heroic boss. It is in their right as consumers to do as they please, meaning, questing, leveling professions, raiding, pvping, chatting, trading... or a combination of those. There is no description on the BOX of World of Warcraft stating: HEY, READ THIS ASSHOLE! THIS GAME IS ONLY ABOUT PLAYERS WHO RAID AND PROVE TO BE BEST BY DOING HEROIC CONTENT! YOU WANT TO GET MORE OF IT? THEN BUCKLE UP SONNY AND START GRINDING THIS BITCH 24/7!!! YA HEAR, YOU'LL DO NOTHING BUT RAID 24/7 AND BEAT THE SHIT OUTA THIS GAME!<br />
<br />
No.<br />
<br />
It doesn't.<br />
<br />
It is a game. Games are meant to be fun and challenging. Challenge is different for each and every person and not everyone agrees on one thing being too easy or too hard. However, you can't call out people stating they suck at a game just because they do something that escapes YOUR definition of &quot;pro play&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Come on stop shitting on blizzard. I bored to doing icc over and over and over yea but i still had fun just playing the game. Would you rather have them put out shitty firelands and have the raid be too easy and have you complain about that? Like any other game company they want their work to be their best. I know you guys might not care but look at what they did with Gears 3. It was suppose to come out april but now september. Yea im pissed at it i want the content now, but hey i bet the single player and the multiplayer will be the shit becaus of the extra months of work. Let blizz work on making the content so you dont complain that much which is already an ordeal im sure. If you don't like it then stop complaining and play another game i hear rifts good. But then again when they need an update you can complain to them about it and /wrists and say fuck you rift!</div></div><hr />

Dolt. Don't be dense, as hard as it must be for you. Of course we'll farm them for gear for people. But I see no reason to go back and flip a switch and make it harder, just for a bit more Epeen.

Just be patient and wait for others to catch up if you really have cleared all the content thus far. It's funny how you don't hear major guilds complain about this kind of stuff but the anonymous posters on these forums take every opportunity to scream and tear their hair out at a perceived &quot;lack of content.&quot;<br />

<br />
<br />
The new heroics are gonna give casual guilds a huge gear boost that they may not currently have. That'll push any 12/12 guild to at least 3/13 HM. If they really want something to do, go for 13/13. It's honestly not hard once you get the ball rolling. Get &quot;free&quot; epix from the new Heroics, kill a few easy heroic bosses on farm to get geared up, and progress from there. It's PROGRESSION.<br />
<br />
Only 33 guilds were able to PROGRESS. Blizzard is giving the rest of the community a kick in the butt to get them going, and then letting them at least finish some of the content before throwing more out.</div></div><hr />

wtf? really? There's exactly 32 guilds in the world, that could say, they are farming this content. That's less than thousand players. out of 12 million. That's 1/12000 of playerbase, which is less than 0.01%. So what the fuck are you saying? I mean, I am glad, because it gives me (and my guild) time to actually try and clear the content before overgearing it (and I think there will also be nerfs after Firelands is introduced). So, yeah, after you get your heroic Sinestra/Nefarian/Al'Akir title, then you can say, you are farming the content. Do you have it? I doubt so....<br />

I said the originally predicted release of 4.1 which a lot of people were estimating would come in May. Now that there won't be a raid I'm guessing as I stated before the 4.1 patch will be released sooner, my estimate being just a matter of weeks now. So if 4.1 were to come sooner, maybe April, and 4.2 comes a month later than the previously speculated May we end up having a release of Firelands around June so not late summer as you said but there's more than a month between. <br />
<br />
Even if I am wrong about the 4.2 release all this means to me is instead of updates not related to the raids being pushed back with them we get those updates sooner.</div></div><hr />

I really don't understand how people want more content if they haven't even seen the content at hand.

Its going to end up like wrath start again, 6 months of the first tier, thought this is a good starting tier with faults and all. So my question here is -<br />
<br />
What raid (if any) is coming with this patch? The only future raid that anyone has got information on is firelands and thats clearly not coming yet. What about the supposed War of the Ancients instance? No solid information on this has been released so this being in Firelands stead is highly unlikely.<br />
<br />
Also going under the impression that 4.1 will be 1-2 months max, its still T11 if there isn't another raid instance so total time of this content will be...nearly 5-6 months.</div></div><hr />

If you play the game casually then this sort of push back is only good for you. If you have been trying to get into raiding since release and have yet to do so, you have failed catastrophically.

Okay, yes they did say it. The post said 4.1 will be 2 months away, so May.

I enjoy my time on wow and when im not i shut it off maybe play another game or maybe go out into the world... of no warcraft and enjoy sum vitamin d. I can wait patiently for the next update and new raids. For the people who say on to the next probably arent paying any attention to any other part of the game or just want the &quot;worlds first&quot;. For those people, im sorry but theres people who have less of a life than you do so be happy that youre not them.</div></div><hr />

If you have been trying to get into raiding since release and have yet to do so, you have failed catastrophically. I'm not syaing those of you that dont like to raid are in some way deficient, just that those trying to and not succeeding are.<br />
<br />
I've cleared through content and will be starting hardmodes soon. The pushing of Firelands back concerns me, but at least the 5 mans will be fun....for my alts at least.<br />
Agreed. If you haven't gotten into raiding by now, you need to take more time to learn to play the game. It isn't everyone else's problem.</div></div><hr />

I refuse to believe that the majority of people are still gearing up in 5 mans. Are these people playing once a week or something?<br />

You can't say that without sounding like a dick. If you truly believe that, you are a massive, massive dick. A throbbing, unwashed member. You're also the problem with this community. Directly. Get out of our games, get out of our forums, step outside and experience real life.<br />

They could have said &quot;FUCK YOU PLAYERS WE'LL MAKE U WAIT UNTIL JUNE TO DO ZA AND ZG CUZ WE WANT TO RELEASE 'EM WITH FIRELANDS HERP DERP&quot;. PTR is usually up 2 months when it's a major raid patch. They'll apply this patch on live in a few weeks (3 at most? I don't know), and right after that PTR for 4.2 will be available.<br />
<br />
Believe me, this is a smart move. All the haters can leave. If you can't see the logic behind this decision you're better out of the game.<br />
<br />
Read the post. &quot;Brack indicated that patch 4.1 is roughly two months away.&quot; Not 3 weeks away.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dindo</div><div class="date">2011-03-04, 02:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Okay, yes they did say it. The post said 4.1 will be 2 months away, so May. Now, I highly doubt they would release 4.2 1 month after that, just because they have to put it on the PTR and etc. So that's at the very least 2 months. And more realistically 3-4 months. Which is September/October. Be realistic about it.<br />
<br />
They've been working on it since Cata's release since it was slated to be released in 4.1. They're not gonna suddenly undo all of that work. At this rate, since 4.1 will be half the size now, it'll be off the PTR soon, and 4.2 will follow pretty shortly. I'd give it 2 months at MOST after 4.1 for 4.2.<br />
<br />
I hope they changed the numbering though, because 2 &quot;major&quot; patches that close will kinda get out of hand by the next expansion. Firelands should really be 4.1.3 or something.</div></div><hr />

Is it Blizz's new design plan to actually force people into hard modes before new content is released? I don't recall reading any such thing.<br />
I had been under the impression that like Lore says, the hard modes arent there for everyone, just the &quot;hardcore&quot;.<br />

You guys make it sound as though all you do is raid and there's nothing else you do to occupy your time. If your guild is forcing you to raid, it probably means that they're still progressing. Maybe/maybe not heroic mode. Don't want to raid tier 11? Do other things in the game besides raiding. Nothing else to do? Then quit. Why play a game you're not enjoying, right? Then come back in 4.2<br />
<br />
BTW, Blizzard didn't say ANYTHING about having 13/13 HM. They probably just want the majority of their player base to be well geared enough so they can go straight into Firelands, and the new heroic dungeons will help with that process.</div></div><hr />

My guild cleared everything on normal mode, but we don't care about heroic modes, because we already saw the content, the story around it and so on. Now, only because we are not hardcore enough to care about heroic modes, we have to wait two major patches before we're given anything to work on? <br />

I am willing to bet the majority of you that think this is a silly decision have not even fully experienced the current raids. Stupid, silly, idiotic Blizzard? No, I say thoughtless, simple minded, slow players for asking for more than what they can currently handle. <br />
<br />
Not to mention it gives them more time to create a more epic encounter, than what is already started.<br />

I agree! If you haven't completed hard modes then why should blizz push out new content to trump current content that obviously the devs put work into? Selfish selfish selfish....Thats the thing with people...you are all so used to the &quot;monolithic&quot; patches that you can't see any good in the new direction blizz wants to take.

You dont have to finish 100% of the content to ask for more. If the game is the same for too long, then it gets boring. You get tired of looking at the same bosses, the same trash, the same mechanics, the same scenery, the same stuff for too long. Think Naxx 2.0, it was the only legitimate raid content for like half a year or something, and loads of people got bored, and then unsubbed. If Blizzard is aiming to keep their subscribers, then they need to actually realease content. They said more than one raid per tier, now we're still waiting on the FIRST of a few for the second tier. And for anyone saying &quot;it'll be realease 'soon' after&quot; wake the hell up, its blizzard, they do nothing fast, EVER. I am seriously disappointed as they, once again, are proving that they dont really know what keeps alot of people happy. Yes the content is better than the lame stuff that was all of Wrath (minus Ulduar) but they still dont get the fact that no matter how shiny something is, it sucks after a long time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
A problem with this is that those 13/13 HC guilds would clear firelands in a month or two and then, by the same 'pattern' of releasing content, 2-3 months later of that point they would have to release new raid content, and it won't give blizzard 'enough time' to release polished content (although, this tier of raiding did have its unpolished mechanics of its own.)<br />
<br />
then blizzard would truly be releasing content for .02% of its player base (or whatever the percentage is) while the other people are at least a tier behind, the exact same model they did not like in vanilla wow.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes it does sound stupid... Because it's a completely irrelevant analogy. It's like complaining that you don't get more achievements when you haven't completed them all. THAT'S what you're looking for.<br />
<br />
And you're right. Current raids will never disappear. But neither will the amazing feeling you get from beating them. Honestly, when ICC was out, did anyone find ANY satisfaction in going back and clearing Naxx? Or even most of Ulduar? I'm not talking about achieves or hardmodes, but just being in there?<br />

I'm a bit jelly of those that are clearing hardmodes already on my server. But that just leads to me hoping that when I do start them that I can do as well as they do.<br />

I don't think it's anything like that. I think they just really underestimate what people want. I like New Content. I personally see heroic raiding as a bonus for those who are really good. In order to be at a heroic raiding level, I think my group needs to massively outgear content, and I don't think it's very interesting to sit here and pray for wrist armor for my Hunter while i'm all ready decked out. No fight except for the zone bosses (Chogall, Nef and Ak'akir) are even a challenge to us anymore, we bowl the entire group of them down in a 4 hour night.</div></div><hr />

I'm a bit jelly of those that are clearing hardmodes already on my server. But that just leads to me hoping that when I do start them that I can do as well as they do.<br />
<br />
I'd like to think thats the more mature way to look at things. As apposed to &quot; If I cant raid because of my life, then no one should!&quot;<br />
<br />
Its more that if 4.1 was still going to be firelands, it would be very unlikely that a guild just starting hardmodes now would be decently progressed within two months.<br />
Presuming of course that 4.1 will be released in that time-frame.</div></div><hr />

Seeing that blizzard just made the decision with how they'll deal with content patches, we don't yet know how long each content patches would last.

If not thats pretty selfish.

Dont like it, then take your little break, but I am sure your guild wont love you for it.<br />
<br />
I am willing to bet the majority of you that think this is a silly decision have not even fully experienced the current raids. Stupid, silly, idiotic Blizzard? No, I say thoughtless, simple minded, slow players for asking for more than what they can currently handle. <br />
<br />
Not to mention it gives them more time to create a more epic encounter, than what is already started.<br />
<br />
This, this right here. Its amazing how many people feel so entitled. Its freaking sickening. You realize that until recently games never before actually release like WoW does? That huge content packages (outside of expansions) were never done before? That Blizzard has been breaking new ground for years now? Holy crap. If its not interesting to you, or if it doesn't hold on your your tiny little attention spans long enough, go some where else... Jeeze... &gt;&lt; <br />
<br />
Save us from the ever lasting tears that you drown yourself and the nonsensical whining. Its not your game. Its Blizzards. They may not do things how you fantasize them to be done. Hell your fantasies may not even be possible or realistic. There are things to get annoyed over, but all this &quot;gimme gimme gimme!&quot; from the children of the more recent generations is ugly as can be.<br />
<br />
I rather them perfect it (as they have done throughout all of Blizzards history) then to shove unfinished products out the door. Hell, thats what most of you complain cataclysm is anyways. You rather them pop it into the next patch unfinished to fuel even more of your collective whining??<br />
<br />
*sigh* It'd be nice of people could look past themselves for once.<br />

Haha i actually wonder sometimes if this is what they will do. Honestly, they've lost it totally, i actually truely believe they employ farm animals to produce content now.

So it's not like you'll have to wait a really long time or anything, we'll probably see Firelands in May or June, which is when I figured we'd see it anyway. Is anyone really all that surprised? If Firelands came out now, it would catch all but the most elite guilds with their pants down. Most of the top server guilds are in the middle of heroic raid content right now, and are nowhere near finishing.<br />
<br />
Don't kid yourselves...when you first heard 4.1 was on the PTR you thought to yourself &quot;Woah, that's really soon!&quot; Had you never been teased with the potential of the Firelands raid coming out so soon, you never even would have thought of it. Yes, it's Blizzard's fault for not being painfully clear right up front that this wasn't the Firelands patch. Other than that however, I don't see what people have to complain about. Sure, if we're entering July and August and Firelands still hasn't come out, then feel free to bitch. But right now, get a grip on reality and quit the whining.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard has always made up for delays with more content... NEVER less content in a more timely manner. Given their track record, I'm already on the rage-train, because I know where this is heading...The customers having to prove they're being slighted eventually.<br />

And let's not forget the joke that most of the initial raid content was (minus Sarth 3d). So much unjustified, illogical, dumb rage in here its ridiculous. People will always find something to cry about with this game, it seems like whatever Blizzard does, it just never is enough. People also seem to have this notion that it is 5-6 months away. Did you even read the article? It clearly states they are going to be releasing smaller patches more often. What does this mean? 4.1 probably eary-mid April, with 4.2 probably early June.<br />
I for one am happy for this. It gives me time to experience all the raid content and not feel rushed, on top of working towards the raid drakes (and no Im not a terrible either, we are currently 3/13 on heroic, so by no means bad). Less than 100 guilds WORLDWIDE have CLEARED this tier FULLY. Why would Blizz release a new raid already...</div></div><hr />

then just don't do it every week play another game mix it up a bit. id really hate to think wow is the only game you play. Raid one week and then maybe wait a week or two and come do it again. revisit old raids, start a new character and if your bored with that, dont play simple as that. Me personally when blizz updates something i cant wait to see it, if its good im happy if theres something wrong with it i just hope they can fix it. thats all i can hope for/ask for.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they mean they can prepare small bits of things at a time (like if someone has an idea for a new 5man dungeon) they can design and balance it and just release it with that, like in vanilla wow where they frequently released single dungeons at a time. During wotlk, they would have to wait for a major raid content before they would release a new dungeon alongside it. <br />
<br />
So it would be more like 'release when this small piece is ready' instead of 'release when EVERYTHING is ready'</div></div><hr />

I believe it is Blizzard's intention to keep the majority happy. I'm not too sure here, but the majority (at least on my server) appears to be players that have often no clue what they're doing and spend a lot of time dicking around in-game, having a social life, or school or work.<br />
<br />
I find these posts amusing on the other hand. You guys can always go play ANOTHER game in the meantime :D Most likely most of the whiners will not and continue farming and bitching in trade and on the forums. A couple will go play another game or cancel their subscription for awhile. In the end, Firelands will come out and all of the whiners will be right back there.<br />
<br />
I also think that Firelands will be out by April or May at the latest. QQ having to spend more time in real life.</div></div><hr />

So I'm totally just speculating, but my gut feeling is that management has set a change of course in the last few months. We just look at the games side of their games, but from a business perspective, they're looking out for the company as a whole. And all managers strive to detect changes in demand, and anticipate and plan for the inflection points in a product's lifespan.<br />
<br />
It's clear that in early 2010 they were still looking at a 3+ year full-subscription lifespan. To wit, the 0-60 revamp, and a reinvigorated new-user marketing effort. WoW at 7-11 anyone?<br />
<br />
However, the last expansion's reception has been less than stellar, and it's not too far-fetched to speculate that subscription trends are not what they were wishing for. If I was managing it, I would have come to some inevitable conclusions about this 6-year-old property.<br />

Did you see their first tier of raid content in Wrath? Of course they had plenty of time to do Ulduar, they only had 3 new raid bosses at release. And considering Cata came out a month later in the year than Wrath and 4.1 will certainly be out before May, you are grossly exaggerating. And considering you don't actually know when Firelands will be released, your dramatics are premature.</div></div><hr />

How are people buying this malarkey? We're paying the same amount we always have, we should get the same amount/quality of content. There's no excuse.<br />
<br />
Not only was ALL of the content cleared by a GOOD PORTION of players by the release of Ulduar, but there's SO MUCH content in your face, and you're complaining about quality and amount? If you're not in the THIRTY-THREE GUILDS that have finished 13/13 HMs, I'd say you have no right to QQ about lack of content.<br />
<br />
If you're worried about quality, well it's not Blizzards fault you're bad and can't clear the raids.</div></div><hr />

Thats why there is a plethora of guilds guilds that raid every week (hardcore) and ones that can vary (casual). My guild is a moderate guild i can take a break and come back. it takes us more time but we are successful in completing the raids.</div></div><hr />

They're slowly but surely cutting down on content. They're fucking pigs. This has finally put the nail in the coffin. I'm done with this game.<br />

Of course they had plenty of time to do Ulduar, they only had 3 new raid bosses at release. And considering Cata came out a month later in the year than Wrath and 4.1 will certainly be out before May, you are grossly exaggerating. And considering you don't actually know when Firelands will be released, your dramatics are premature.<br />

I'd say they're right on schedule if you think 4.2 is going to happen within a couple months from now.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Come up with a different argument than &quot;I dont have time to raid, why would blizzard give other people the things I want?!&quot; And I'll consider that.</div></div><hr />

I'm not interested in clearing the raids right away. They aren't going anywhere. I'm interested in what happens to the money I spend on the game. I want to make sure that they use it to the extreme they always have, if I notice a backslide towards the customer end, it's still their problem. I enjoy this game, but I'm not a serf to it. I'm not going to pretend that I think they aren't shorting us. This is NOT typical behavior for them. They sure as hell aren't above customer criticism.</div></div><hr />

Get out of our games, get out of our forums, step outside and experience real life.<br />

You pathetic dick.<br />

I second the notion, albeit not the wording of it ;)</div></div><hr />
