Quel’Delar in now unique equip.<br />
Naxxramas can now be cleared in any order for the Immortal and Undying achievements.<br />
The drop rate for the Battered Hilt has been increased.<br />
The Skeletal Slave in the Pit of Saron has had the ability to drop the Battered Hilt and other random drop epics removed. <br />
<br />
<br />
Battered Hilt and Epic Drop Rate Changes<br />
Based on feedback we’ve been provided by players, we’d like to make you aware of a couple of changes we are applying to Icecrown Citadel: The Frozen Halls via in-game fixes. Firstly, we are increasing the drop rate of the Battered Hilt in all three wings of this Heroic five-player dungeon. We have seen a great deal of discussion about this item’s chance of dropping since the release of patch 3.3.0 and agree that it is currently too low. As a result, players should find greater accessibility to this item while running these dungeons, or while trading with other players who have it.<br />
<br />
In light of this change, we are also removing the chance for the Battered Hilt or any other epic item to drop from the Skeletal Slaves in the Pit of Saron. The need to “farm” these creatures for the Battered Hilt should be reduced by our first in-game fix and will no longer result in a chance for epic loot or Battered Hilts.<br />
<br />
You’re welcome to discuss these changes in this thread and provide us with any additional feedback you may have. Please refrain from creating additional threads about these in-game fixes at this time.<br />

Phasing Bugs in Icecrown<br />
This is an issue about which we're aware. There are a number of phased quests spanning the zone that can currently cause players to appear in different phases outside the citadel's gates, the most notable of which is &quot;Battle Before the Citadel.&quot; We are working to address the way creatures in the area are shown as a result of phasing in order to address this.

Ignoring someone prevents from grouping with them in a random dungeon<br />
Yes, and this is true also for players not on your realm. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21726257919-repeatedly-getitng-stuck-with-the-same-jerks.html))<br />
<br />
Why can't i queue for Battlegrounds and Dungeons at the same time?<br />
We've made changes in the past to Battleground queuing specifically to try and dissuade players from wanting to leave a match before it ends. Getting a Battleground going with even numbers on both sides is a delicate balance and we don't want to incentivize players to leave. To a lesser extent, the same is true for leaving dungeons early.<br />
<br />
We don't want to encourage you to queue hop between PvE and PvP content as time allows. If you were able to queue for Battlegrounds and dungeons at the same time, chances are you'd be leaving one or the other early and repeat this behavior as you see fit.<br />
<br />
I believe you'll see queue times for Battlegrounds balance a bit once the Dungeon Finder feature isn't quite the &quot;new toy&quot; that it is now. You'll also see a significant change in game play opportunities once the rated Battleground system is implemented in Cataclysm.<br />
<br />
For now though, given the average wait times for Battlegrounds and dungeons, coupled with the average run times for each dungeon or Battleground, we feel the majority of players are best served by being allowed only to queue for one system at a time. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/1/21724988699-blue-why-cant-i-queue-bgs-and-rds.html))<br />
<br />
Healing in Cataclysm<br />
I wouldn't look to Icecrown as a taste of what's to come with regard to healing. Icecrown is at the end of this expansion. At level 85 it's okay if things feel a little different.<br />
<br />
At a very coarse level, if you have a free GCD and can choose one of two spells we'd like for that choice to be between for example A) Your cheap spell that doesn't heal for much and B) Your expensive spell that heals for a lot. Currently cheap vs. expensive is pretty meaningless so your choice is between small spell or big spell, which doesn't feel like much of a choice, especially given the damage bosses can do.<br />
<br />
But imagine that if you cast B every time when A would have been more appropriate, then the risk is you will run out of mana. You aren't choosing your spells based solely on the mana (so it isn't a primary focus) but better healers will be those that use the right spell for the situation. <br />
<br />
[...] We don't think the sky is falling. This change would primarily be for three reasons:<br />
<br />
1) You care more about mana regen on gear instead of just throughput. This is the least important consideration because it still works today to some extent.<br />
<br />
2) You care more about your whole arsenal of heals instead of just the biggest, fastest one. Paladins for example currently can go for a Flash of Light build or a Holy Light build but they aren't often mixing the two together. A Holy Light focused paladin isn't using FoL to hit the tank from a small hit. They're just using HL and overhealing.<br />
<br />
3) Boss encounters don't need to be built around destroying the tank in 2 hits. Currently, that is one of the few ways we have to make players actually lose a fight. (The other is that you lose enough healers or dps through attrition that you just can't keep going). Healers running out of mana used to be another point of failure and it pushed things in slightly different directions. Tanks for example cared slightly more about avoidance stats because nobody wanted to be the dreaded mana sponge. Standing in fires didn't have to be about dying in 1 sec if you didn't move -- it was more that you wasted healer mana by taking unnecessary damage. DPS who didn't do enough dps risked the fight going long and the healers running out of mana. Currently the long fight is only an issue if it opens up more chances for tank death or there is a severe berserk timer. <br />
<br />
[...] We're not sure the five second rule is a rousing success. It's not necessarily fun for players to stand there and do nothing. It definitely wasn't fun to heal in rotation and do nothing for a minute or two so you could regen.<br />
<br />
What I'm talking about is just returning HPM (healing per mana) to being a consideration that actually matters again. Do you want to use the cheap spell or the expensive spell? Currently you only really care about the fast spell or maybe the big spell.<br />
<br />
Healers will need some tools to manage their mana, and they already have some like Innervate and the Shadow Fiend. Those tools can't be counted on for unlimited mana of course or we're back to the same problem. <br />
<br />
[...] The more careful selection of spells is actually what we're going for. I think that can be just as challenging, and personally probably more fun, than the miss a GCD and the tank gets it style.<br />
<br />
But really I was trying to offer reassurance to those healers who seem terrified that we're going to make healing too hard in Cataclysm. That's not the goal. Making it fun is the goal. However, when healing is too easy, it's hard for it to be very fun. As I've said before (maybe in this thread?) DPS specs can try to see how fast they can make a farm run. The healer doesn't really get to try and &quot;heal faster&quot; or whatever. The most fun a healer can have in content on farm status is trying to keep everyone alive as efficiently as possible. Efficiency implies a mana component. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/27/21627632910-healing-in-cata--blizz-post.html))<br />
<br />
Dungeon Finder and tanks<br />
Your chances of finding a group in a timely manner are still vastly improved post-patch 3.3. This is in addition to the fact that you can now go out into the world and do whatever you want while you wait without camping a chat channel or LFG system. Once the Dungeon Finder selects a party for you, you can just return back to what you were doing while you wait in the queue again. I was doing this last night and found it to be a great opportunity to wrap up some daily quests in between dungeon runs.<br />
<br />
That said, the fact of the matter is that this system is still largely contingent upon the number of players who select the tanking role and, to a slightly lesser degree on some Battlegroups, healing role. Your post was created during prime time for east coast realms, nearing prime time for west coast realms. This is when most players are online; however, many players are running raids, whether it be Trial of the Crusader, Icecrown Citadel, or the weekly raid quest. This tends to lessen the availability of tanks and healers for many Battlegroups.<br />
<br />
I was grouping with a healer last night who had no problem finding instant dungeons earlier in the afternoon, but by 8 o'clock server time we were waiting at least ten minutes to find a tank. We ended up sticking with a particularly good tank we came across from another realm and ran about 10 Heroic dungeons together with instant queues. If you perform your DPS or healing role well, there's no harm in trying to stick with a tank once you've found one... if they're willing and able.

<br />
So, why the fuck You cant add simple punishment for leaving those before it ends?! Wy the hell i cant play at BG while waiting for raid?! Why the hell leaving BG/dangeon before it ends COST NOTHING!?<br />
<br />
My idea:<br />
If You leave BG before it ends you gain -500 honor and -1 THIS BG mark. If You leave dangeon BEFORE it ends You will pay 10g (50g totaly) and 2-3 emblems of frost. Simple and painful way to stop leavers :P<br />

Sounds like a bugfix after they've implemented the possibility to fight sapphiron without clearing the wings.<br />

I would like some kind of a different healing system for cata ...<br />
<br />
Right now as a shaman its quite boring to heal in a raid - mostly spamming Chainheal and sometimes here and there Riptide.<br />
<br />
Only when I help with MT healing I use my glyphed lesser healing wave or the big one. But it's rare. AND I need Chainheal so I don't run out of mana (every crit ticks a manareg - cheap spell + many crits = massiv mana restore &lt;3)<br />
<br />
I would like to have some kind of combo system - as example another game - ragnarok online. Theres a class called monk, a melee dd. First you need to get your spirit sphere ready (flying around you like water shield, stacks up to 5) and then the combo begins. Hit the enemy ... then &quot;Raging Trifecta Blow&quot; (three strikes with added dmg) procs sometimes &gt; use skill &quot;Raging Quadruple Blow&quot; right after (like trifecta, but with 4 hits and more dmg) &gt; use &quot;Raging Thrust&quot; after quad (one hit, knock back, big dmg, uses one spirit sphere) &gt; &quot;Guillotine Fist&quot; (your ultimate skill after the combo chain, dealing a fuckload of dmg, ignoring all def, but uses up all mana, all spirit sphere (you need at least 4 to cast) and gives a 5 min cd for manareg - nice way of onehitting a heal in pvp :P)<br />
<br />
Right now I have some kind of combo &gt; Riptide procs a buff for the next two lesser healing wave/healing wave, getting some extra crit chance for lhw and a 30% shorter cast time for hw and/or I get a higher chainheal when I hit someone with a riptide hot.<br />
<br />
But more of it would be nice - I just don't want to stand in a raid, jump out of a fire sometimes and hit CH like mad :(<br />
<br />
And with higher heal pools - why not do combos? you get a small and high heal, but those wouldnt do too much heal, so it would be more effective to chain them in a (timed!) combo, so you get your &quot;super heal&quot; out. <br />
<br />
That would be awesome :3<br />
<br />
Some kind of AOE combo, usual heal combo, shield combo etc. pp. :D</div></div><hr />

I don't have problems getting into dungeons as a tank on my main, but this would help a lot, especially on lower levels, for any DPS.

Based on feedback we’ve been provided by players, we’d like to make you aware of a couple of changes we are applying to Icecrown Citadel: The Frozen Halls via in-game fixes. Firstly, we are increasing the drop rate of the Battered Hilt in all three wings of this Heroic five-player dungeon. We have seen a great deal of discussion about this item’s chance of dropping since the release of patch 3.3.0 and agree that it is currently too low. As a result, players should find greater accessibility to this item while running these dungeons, or while trading with other players who have it.<br />
<br />
In light of this change, we are also removing the chance for the Battered Hilt or any other epic item to drop from the Skeletal Slaves in the Pit of Saron. The need to “farm” these creatures for the Battered Hilt should be reduced by our first in-game fix and will no longer result in a chance for epic loot or Battered Hilts.<br />
<br />
You’re welcome to discuss these changes in this thread and provide us with any additional feedback you may have. Please refrain from creating additional threads about these in-game fixes at this time.<br />
<br />

So what should Blizzard do against players not willing to take the tiniest bit of responsibility that tanking is? Making it even more easy, like say, all mobs automatically hit the guy who is marked as tank?<br />
<br />
Most of the times I queue I end up with at least 2 dps DKs/Paladins/Warriors in the group, all of them who solely queued as DPS. It's not like there's a lack of tanking classes ...<br />
<br />
But now that I think about it, there's an easy solution to the tank shortage - automatically put classes that can tank (or heal for that matter) to the end of the queue if they did not sign up as either, so that all players who queued up any two of tank/heal/dps get a spot first.</div></div><hr />

I can now either wait till some better weapon drops from ICC 25 or I can go for this weapon which gives me about 300 DPS.<br />
<br />
<br />
I doubt the rating on the hilt in EU has been increased though. I've been running PoS and FoS heroic all day now, killing the trash until the first boss and then starting over. We've killed over 500 trash mobs and had zero, 0 drops. That's a lot of nothing for an increased drop chance.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
automatically put classes that can tank (or heal for that matter) to the end of the queue if they did not sign up as eitherI've got another idea. Why not do that, but then for pure classes? They are the ones being egoistic not rolling a class who can tank or heal. ---Sounds stupid? Yeah, so does your idea. You won't get more tanks by punishing the DPS spec of those classes.<br />
<br />
I for one would enjoy tanking more if there were less stupid people, hitting all kind of mobs except the one that is marked.</div></div><hr />

The complete ICC loot list wasn't available the first day while QD drop rates were so high. He assumed (as did I) that there would be better from ICC25, if not ICC10. Turns out there isn't, at least for me as an arcane mage. The only weapon with haste has hit. Very poorly itemized weapons for arcane mages from ICC. Quel's my BIS until heroic modes unlock, or maybe Arthas's loot table, since that isn't available yet.<br />
<br />
@Offhand: Just because YOUR class doesn't get much out of QD doesn't mean it can't be another class's BIS until the heroic unlock and higher ilvl ICC gear. WTB haste/crit or haste/spirit dagger/sword from Icecrown (they're haste/hit and crit/spirit atm).</div></div><hr />

<br />
That's because the only weapon worth getting in 10 men ToC was in 10 men ToGC tribute chest.<br />
<br />
But yes, if a battered hilt drops, I'll roll on it and send it to an alt for sure, I have a 258 right now, so it's not really an upgrade and there is no tanking one I could use for my off-spec.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
What do you suggest they &quot;do&quot; about the tank shortage? Force people to tank? Make tanking easier (how exactly? Most tanks that are tanks now like the challenge)? I have two primary characters, a rogue and a Druid. The Rogue is my main, and the Druid is my alt. The Druid is main-spec heal and off-spec tank. Thankfully I like to tank, because if I queue my Druid I have a group within seconds and 90% of the time it's as tank. My rogue usually has to wait five or ten minutes for a group. <br />
<br />
As I said, I like to tank, it's fun. It doesn't mean that I'm going to stop playing my Rogue so that there are more tanks available. It doesn't mean I'm going to stop queuing as a healer, so on those occasions when I'm chosen to heal there is one less tank in the system. If they changed tanking so that it wasn't so important, I'm not sure I'd want to do it anymore. The make or break aspect is what makes it interesting. Frustrating... difficult when you have a bad tank... but interesting.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Because QD is complete weaksauce for anyone who plans on raiding at all. QD is an offset weapon for your main at best.<br />
<br />
<br />
Dude. The rogue version of QD is better than any weapon in ten man ICC for combat. There's better in 25 man of course, but not everyone raids 25 man. The MH axe from 10 man ICC itemizes more toward stam, and is slightly inferior to QD, Cunning of the Shadows</div></div><hr />

550 trash kills so far and still no hilt drop. And even then it's a 1/5 chance that I will win it. I &quot;love&quot; this high drop chance &gt;&lt;</div></div><hr />

Well, if you're going to limit yourself to 10 man, that's not my fault.<br />
<br />
<br />
These statements contradict each other. Not to mention that not only do have to do 25 mans, but 25 man hard modes to get the ToC weapons you're talking about. So what you really meant was &quot;QD is complete weaksauce for anyone who plans on raiding [25 man hard mode content] at all.&quot; Which takes your statement from affecting about 50-60% of the level 80 population down to more like 5-6%.</div></div><hr />

ToC hardmodes are fairly easy when you're comparing to, say, Ulduar. If you're not capable of it, it's ok to admit it...<br />

10 mans are kinda glorified heroics, not really raids.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Hardly. Then again, you've done really nothing else in this thread except display sheer ignorance, so I don't blame you for saying this.<br />
<br />
You should try doing 10 mans without 25 man gear to make it easier. 25 mans seem hardcore to the people that do them because you don't have a higher tier of gear to help make it easier, much like you do with 10 mans. I'm not claiming 10 mans are equally difficult (to be fair, the only difficulty is getting 15 more retards to pay attention), but I always laugh when I see the &quot;hardcores&quot; shit on 10 mans because they don't use common sense.<br />
<br />
I'll do my &quot;glorified&quot; heroics, have fun seeing content with a tight group of friends and get good gear for my chosen progression path. You can continue thinking your self worth is measured by how many people are in your raid.<br />
<br />
For what it's worth, my small 10 man guild (14 active raiding members) have pugged the remaining raid and killed the first 3 bosses in 25 ICC (didn't bother attempting Saurfang since it was late, but we have amazing DPS anyway). But always remember how hardcore you are, big guy :)</div></div><hr />

Ulduar Hardmodes, yes, but not normal Ulduar.<br />
<br />
Of the guilds on WoWProgress:<br />
The Descent into Madness (H): 9691 (30.71%)<br />
Heroic Beasts (25): 7211 (22.85%)<br />
<br />
So 22.85% of the raiding population (which is in itself not every single level 80) is capable of getting what for an arcane mage amounts to a sidegrade weapon as compared to Quel'Delar by downing heroic beasts every week until it drops and they win the roll to pick up an ilvl 258 dagger with wasted hit on it. The hilt is worth 5 dps less per Rawr and far easier to get. Far from &quot;weaksauce&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Indeed, but this means ~77% of the raiding population is sadly retarded.<br />
<br />
EDIT: It you want QD for your main and your mainspec, go for it. It's just a waste in the larger scheme of things. Making a gear decision because about 1/4 of an instances worth of loot is available is going to just disappoint you in a very short amount of time (like next month even).</div></div><hr />

Now please, this include people who did those with toc gear lol, you can't really rely on that.<br />

<br />
This site already listed ALL of the Icecrown gear up through but not including the Lich King.<br />
<br />
None of it is an upgrade vs. Quel for an arcane mage drowning in hit (which is most of us).<br />
<br />
So it's not &quot;next month&quot;, it's when the LAST unlock occurs, which is more likely at least two months away, if not close to 3. I think running 3 heroics every day until one gets a hilt is worthwhile for an upgrade that'll last 3 months and is equivalent to the best weapon available until then, which comes from a hard mode.<br />
<br />
Now I fully admit that's completely spec-dependent and ToC/ICC weapons may be well-itemized for most other specs. They aren't for arcane. Your inability to look at the game outside your own little corner of 24 people carrying you through stuff so you think it's easy is making this entire dialogue pointless though.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Because 1-2 were dropping per heroic that first day and a LOT of people got it (including me) then they nerfed it to where it should have been all along, that's what prompted the amount of complaints from the people who didn't get it that first day (justifiably so).<br />
<br />
I also think it was a mistake making the hilt not BOP. We don't need more overpriced epics on the AH.</div></div><hr />

Retarded statement is retarded. Nobody in the game has access to 26 man raids. Now 25 man raids are different. Most people can access them, the only people who &quot;can't&quot; are either bads or people who are too lazy which both I dont feel deserve any better than ilevel 200 gear.</div></div><hr />

Offhand, you can't paint all the classes with a generic brush. As I have stated in a previous comment, Quel'Delar is the 2nd best unholy dk dps weapon in the game right now, behind only Bryntroll in ICC 25. That will change when more ICC bosses are unlocked and then hardmodes unlocked, but right now QD is a perfectly viable progression weapon.<br />

It is also the best caster weapon if you are hit capped. (or 2nd best ... I need to compare it against the ICC 25 caster dagger)</div></div><hr />

The itemization of the 2h QD is quite nice for unholy. The issue is that you didn't include ToC drops in your BiS list. QD is nice, but even with only 1 wing of ICC easymode open it still isn't BiS for anybody.<br />
<br />
Bryntoll is is best weapon in the game right now purely due to ilvl. Elsewhere though there are at least two ToC items with higher top end then QD and two sockets.</div></div><hr />

Your previous posts just scream &quot;I FAIL AT LIFE&quot; when you think you're more entitled to a nice weapon just because you play this game x times more than another person, or because you think you take this game more seriously that that other person.<br />
<br />
The simple fact is this weapon is in the game mostly for the players that are not hardcore progression raiders, or for those progression raiders that haven't gotten into hard mode ToC-25 and are using it to tide them over until more of ICC opens up. So get over yourself.</div></div><hr />

I don't think anyone who raids 25 mans at all is going to claim the QD is Godly. It's not, and it's not supposed to be. If I had ever gotten Anub to drop the damned MH axe (and actually won the roll) it would be a marginal upgrade at best. Having said that, I had rotten luck getting the MH axe from Anub, so it was a pretty decent upgrade for me. Since my guild doesn't raid 25 man, and PuGs aren't doing ICC yet on my server, it's the best I'm likely to get for a while. It is BiS for a few limited specs, at least according to some modeling, but mostly there's better out there. Just not necessarily better that &quot;anyone who does any kind of raiding&quot; is likely to get in the next couple of weeks. And hey, if I get into an ICC25 PuG this week and get Saurfang's sword? Great, I'll take the upgrade. In the mean time QD will help me get there.</div></div><hr />

1800 isn't that hard to get. A lot of it is about team composition these days though. <br />
<br />
It is much much easier than in previous seasons and Burning Crusade. <br />

To give you an idea, I had a 5v5 team season 5 at 1965 rating. We didn't even get &quot;Rival&quot;, which is top 10% of teams. Nowadays you can be in the top 35% (Challenger title range) and still get weapons. It's not a majority but it's getting damn near close to it.</div></div><hr />

I need a weapon without hit as I am already over the cap and haven't even equiped my Ashen Verdict ring yet and it has even more hit... Why should I who can easily get equivalent level weapons be denied an alternative like Quel'Delar because Blizzard thinks making it a stupidly low drop rate makes it more epic? If it's going to be this hard to get then raise the stats to 264 level...</div></div><hr />

Both the 20 slot and 22 slot bags have a chance in dropping in both the normal and heroic modes of the Forge of Souls. Enjoy the new bags =). (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/13/21724988191-papas-brand-new-bag-does-not-drop-on-heroic.html))<br />

You got the linking wrong there bibi, both point to papa's new bag. The brand new bag would be item 50316.<br />

Nobody in the game has access to 26 man raids. Now 25 man raids are different. Most people can access them, the only people who &quot;can't&quot; are either bads or people who are too lazy which both I dont feel deserve any better than ilevel 200 gear. <br />
<br />
<br />
you are a retard. unable to sense the possibility of misstyping, eh? 5 is next to 6 ...just to let you know.<br />
<br />
besides, playing the game srsly doesn't mean to spend much time in raiding. People who play srsly don't need that time. They know their classes and game mechanics quite well and understand how boss x actually works. The major problem is, that there are not that many people out there who fullfill these requirements. that is why people think pro = lots of time spending in wow and noob = not much time spending in wow. but tbh the actual pros are just noobs with more time, otherwise they wouldn't need to spend that much time for raiding ...<br />
<br />
proof that I am wrong if you like :p</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Onthar</div><div class="date">2009-12-17, 01:03 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">So the drop rate was increased, but the number of mobs who can drop it has been decreased. So in Pit of Saron, thats somewhere around 30 less mobs that can now drop the hilt. And how many others are in there? Most groups are 1-4 mobs, so I believe theres somewhere around 45-50 mobs that can drop the hilt. Wow-armory is still saying drop chance is 1-2%(which is bogus). So even if it was changed from 1% to 1.5%(which i don't think its that high), its actually a decrease in drop rate in Pit.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It is much much easier than in previous seasons and Burning Crusade. <br />
<br />
To give you an idea, I had a 5v5 team season 5 at 1965 rating. We didn't even get &quot;Rival&quot;, which is top 10% of teams. Nowadays you can be in the top 35% (Challenger title range) and still get weapons. It's not a majority but it's getting damn near close to it. <br />
<br />
<br />
You're assuming, however, that most people want to do Arenas. Quite frankly, if I want to get a decent weapon that gets replaced in just a few months, I'd rather be seeing raid content. Only reason I'd be doing arena is for a Gladiator mount.<br />
<br />
Anyway, the Quel'Delar is not really for the &quot;hardcore&quot; raiders or the &quot;hardcore&quot; PvPers. Those specializations get their &quot;hardcore&quot; weapons. QD is for those that probably won't see a weapon upgrade for a long time. It's not as good as the top-end stuff you'd get from hard mode raiding or a high arena rating, but it's good enough to keep players competitive. That's the main point I was getting at a couple pages back. It's not that players don't &quot;deserve&quot; a good weapon because there isn't some insane grind involved. It's the same philosophy that Blizzard implemented with the changes to Emblems. They don't want to force players that maybe haven't played since Naxx and new alts to have to trudge through every tier of content to stay up to date with the latest and greatest stuff. I, for one, am glad that after tanking Naxx on both 10 and 25 for months, and doing the same with Ulduar and ToC, I don't have to farm those instances for months before I can get my hunter into ICC. Also glad I can get a decent weapon for my ret off-spec and for my hunter, since most of my time is spent grinding out raids and emblems to gear out my main tank spec.</div></div><hr />

As a holy paladin, I feel that I'm just a healing brute who focuses on one healing spell over the two others (lol). Back in Burning Crusade, I felt more challenged when healing in raid contents, where I would actually bring mana potions, or even the potion that puts you to sleep to restore mana. Back then, things revolved around the healers alittle more, which meant that DPS HAD to be decent, and tanks had to have both avoidance and stam (not one or the other). <br />
<br />
And if this change really occurs, will players be able to use potions more than once per fight?</div></div><hr />

Also, I have a pally who heals and DPS's. I Ret in arenas and Heal in raids. I consider neither to be my offspec since I use them equally as much.

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">karth</div><div class="date">2009-12-19, 08:04 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">So what should Blizzard do against players not willing to take the tiniest bit of responsibility that tanking is? Making it even more easy, like say, all mobs automatically hit the guy who is marked as tank?<br />
<br />
Most of the times I queue I end up with at least 2 dps DKs/Paladins/Warriors in the group, all of them who solely queued as DPS. It's not like there's a lack of tanking classes ...<br />
<br />
But now that I think about it, there's an easy solution to the tank shortage - automatically put classes that can tank (or heal for that matter) to the end of the queue if they did not sign up as either, so that all players who queued up any two of tank/heal/dps get a spot first.<br />
i have never heard some thing so stupid.... punish people for choosing a class that can do both healing, tanking or dps just so a mage, lock or a rogue can get a group faster? VERY STUPID</div></div><hr />

Im sorry but any ret paladin, dps war, or dps dk with a 5k range gear score can tank a heroic without respecing. And since it generally puts me with at least a couple 5k+ people I see quite a few 5k range plate dps who won't Q as tank. They are just lazy and dont want to try, and since their laziness is holding other people up I can see a possible reason to penalize them. <br />
<br />
I mean I can tank a large portion of heroics on my rogue and have done so with a guild healer keeping me up (granted there are things in certain ones esp the icc ones that can 1 shot me so that doesnt work). Ive also seen our fury war do the same without bothering to put a shield on.<br />
<br />
And honestly having a 5k gs plate dps tank is better than getting some one who is actually spec'd for it and doesnt even have 30k health since they won't keep agro anyway.</div></div><hr />

I think Blizzard's handling of the hilt is amazingly stupid. IMHO, these are a gold sellers best friend, which I thought Blizzard was combating against?<br />

I got several the first night of patch 3.3 , I also purchased several for 2-5k each, sold all of them for 30k each. I maxed my gold on 2 toons because of these.<br />

They should be BOP, Unique, and after you done the quest, you cannot get another (ie, you dont see it drop). If you want one for an alt, easy, run the instances with your alt. Which is what you have to do anyways!</div></div><hr />

While Palladins, Warriors and Death knights are able to tank, selecting purely DPS roles doesn't help themselves either. They are hindered in queue as much as any other DPS class. I wouldn't penalize them for not selecting the tanking role, because their wait time is &quot;punishment&quot; enough.<br />
I'm also going to nitpick at your &quot;lazy&quot; comment. Maybe some players are lazy, but there could be many aversions to tanking. The biggest aversion to tanking is prolly the mindset. Being a tank tanked myself, it's not harder to tank, just different. Like any other class role if you can gear and spec properly, as well as behave accordianly, you will succeed. IMO, there isn't a big inequality between the difficulties in mastering the class roles. <br />
But in tanking (and healing), when you screw up, EVERYONE loses, and you may get booted from the group (perhaps rightly so). Having that &quot;pressure&quot; weigh on your mind as you play a game is not fun for some players.</div></div><hr />

BoP yes, unique and can't see drops not necessarily. Plenty of people need two different ones for different things they want to do; no reason a dedicated-enough player shouldn't be able to get it twice. They just need to stop everyone present from rolling just because they'll take it to the AH and make a quick 20k gold and it'll be fine.</div></div><hr />
