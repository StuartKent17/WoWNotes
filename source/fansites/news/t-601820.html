<br />
Anytime you killed Mal’Ganis in the Stratholme level of Warcraft 3: Reign of Chaos, you only succeeded in slowing him down. His body would reform shortly thereafter to continue taunting Arthas and encourage him to take the path of insanityâ€¦ and power. <br />
<br />
No matter what happens to Mal’Ganis in the upcoming Caverns of Time instance, his mission to drive Arthas to Frostmourne will not be undone. <br />

Draenei Male shoulders<br />
Orc shoulders are getting fixed ... But it seems that Draenei shoulders became smaller in one of the PTR patch too. I'm not sure how much they scaled them down but it's an intended change.<br />
<br />
This was an intended change, Male Draenei shoulders were larger than intended before.<br />

Gilneas<br />
Sorry, no Gilneas (http://www.wowwiki.com/Gilneas) anytime soon.<br />
<br />
At this time, the nation of Gilneas which stands behind the Greymane Wall remains a secluded mystery. One day we may see the portcullis and the region open to visitors and explorers alike, but we do not know when or if that day will come.<br />

Black Temple Movie<br />
Yeah ... Black Temple movies are a bit 2 months ago, but mYm.WoW (Also known as Curse (http://www.curse-guild.org/)) released a full movie of the instance, and it looks nice. Only problem could be the download size ... *coughs* 1.2gb *coughs*<br />

Although in BM it's a timer...oh wait! you can put a timer there too (like in wc3 if you don't get them fast enough Mal Ganis wins!) making it so you have to birnn a house down fast enough so people don't turn into undeads (in which case they get taken away by Mal Ganis, exactly like in wc3...still)<br />
I'd like that a lot!</div></div><hr />
