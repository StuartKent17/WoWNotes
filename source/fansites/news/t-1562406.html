<br />
<br />
Class Changes<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid <br />
Talents<br />
<br />
Dream of Cenarius (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/108373)<br />
<br />
Balance: The talent has been redesigned for Balance Druids and now causes Moonfire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/8921) and Sunfire (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/93402) casts with Lunar or Solar Peak to also heal a random injured ally. Casting Healing Touch (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5185) no longer increases the damage bonus of the Druid’s next Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577). Eclipse (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/79577) now causes the Druid’s next Healing Touch (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5185) to become instant cast and reset the cooldown on Starsurge (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/78674).<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/images.gif Mage<br />
Frost Changes<br />
<br />
The Brain Freeze (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/44549) effect now increases Frostfire Bolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/44614) damage by 25%, and can now stack up to 2 times. It also no longer triggers from the Bomb Talents, and instead has a 10% chance to trigger from Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) casts. Each Multistrike of Frostbolt (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/116) increases that cast's chance by an additional 25% 45%. (Total of 60% 100% on double-Multistrikes).<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipriests.gif Priest <br />
Talent Revisions<br />
<br />
From Darkness, Comes Light (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109186) has been split into two abilities depending on the Priest's specialization.<br />
<br />
Surge of Darkness (Shadow) now has a maximum of 3 charges (up from 2) and can now also trigger its effect from Devouring Plague (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/124467), but its chance to trigger has been reduced to 10% (down from 20%) to compensate.<br />
Surge of Light (Discipline, Holy) activation chance has been reduced to 10% (down from 15%).<br />
<br />
Solace and Insanity has been split into Power Word: Solace (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/129250) for Discipline and Holy, and Insanity for Shadow.<br />
<br />
Insanity has been changed to cause consuming Shadow Orbs (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/95740) to transform Mind Flay (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/15407) into Insanity for 2 seconds per Shadow Orb consumed.<br />
<br />
Twist of Fate (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/109142) now only triggers from healing for Discipline and Holy Priests, and only triggers from damage for Shadow Priests.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ishamans.gif Shaman <br />
Elemental Overload and Molten Earth<br />
Chain Lightning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/421) was also improved significantly to offset the fact that Elemental Overload was a massive buff to it, but Molten Earth is not.<br />
<br />
Chain Lightning (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/421)’s damage has been increased by 50%.<br />
<br />
<br />
Restoration Changes<br />
<br />
Elemental Blast (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/117014) now also grants increased Spirit for Restoration Shaman, in addition to the random secondary stat. Spirit amount granted is equal to double the random secondary stat amount.<br />
Riptide (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/61295)’s healing has been adjusted to put significantly more of it into the initial heal. The initial heal amount has been increased by 70%, while the periodic healing amount has been reduced by 20%.<br />
<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/iwarriors.gif Warrior<br />
Ability Consolidation and Refinement<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Stance Changes<br />
<br />
Wild Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/100130) now requires Battle Stance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2457).<br />
<br />
<br />
Arms Changes<br />
<br />
Battle Stance (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/2457) for Arms Warriors now generates 67% 140% more Rage from auto-attacks and Critical Strikes now generate double Rage.<br />
Colossus Smash (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/86346) now costs 20 30 Rage, deals 225% increased damage, and no longer increases the damage of Slam (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/1464).<br />
Execute (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/5308) for Arms Warriors now costs 10 Rage, and consumes up to 30 40 additional Rage to deal additional damage.<br />
Mortal Strike (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/12294) now costs 20 30 Rage (instead of generating 10 Rage).<br />
<br />
<br />
Talent Changes<br />
<br />
Piercing Howl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/12323) has been removed and replaced with a new talent, Sudden Death (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/29725).<br />
<br />
Piercing Howl (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/12323) is now available to all Fury Warriors as a baseline ability.<br />
<br />
Disrupting Shout (http://ptr.wowdb.com/spells/102060) has been removed and replaced with 3 new talents that vary by specialization.<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Warlords of Draenor - Quest Markers on the World Map<br />
Starting in Talador, you'll soon start seeing quest bangs on the world map for major quest lines that you are eligible for but don't have in progress. Other zones will follow shortly after.<br />
<br />
This system is designed to act as a backup mechanism should you fall off of a quest line for some reason. While it is not terrible if you're guided to content this way, it is still our preference that we lead you there smoothly through the quests themselves, and only have this as a backup should you miss something.<br />
<br />
We're very interested in hearing feedback on this system as you start to experience it. Also, if you somehow miss a major quest and end up depending on these map bangs to lead you back, we'd still love to hear about those too so that we can look to reduce the chances of missing them.<br />
<br />
Thank you for your help with this. We hope you enjoy this new feature.<br />
<br />

Warlords of Draenor Theorycraft Discussion<br />
Is there a formula or &quot;rules of thumb&quot; for determining a targets hitbox size and geometry?<br />
Shape is always circular. Creature hitbox varies, of course. Player hitboxes are consistent though the exact size rarely matters (I believe it's 0.5yd radius). <br />
<br />
What actually matters is combat reach. That's always 1.5yd for players, and larger for larger creatures. The distance away that you can attack a creature is...<br />
<br />
Melee attack: MAX(5, SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + 4/3) + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(8/3)<br />
Ranged attack: SourceCombatReach + TargetCombatReach + AttackRange + IfSourceAndTargetAreRunning(2)<br />
AoE: TargetCombatReach + AttackRadius + IfSourceIsRunning(2) (Blue Tracker (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/318876-warlords-of-draenor-theorycraft-discussion/) / Official Forums (http://us.battle.net/wow/en/forum/topic/13087818929?page=26#503))<br />

Have you ever considered instead of tweaking individual abilities to give everyone a &quot;tuning&quot; passive ability?<br />
Yeah, we have that under the hood for emergencies (see Brewmasters on live). Results in a more cohesive game if we don't tho. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491757001827831808))<br />
<br />
From a healer's perspective where will incoming tank damage be in Warlords' raids? More attention needed than MoP? Wrath? =)<br />
More than MoP. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492048280310669312))<br />
<br />
There is a difference between a spec needing balance and most players idea of &quot;competitive&quot;.<br />
People tweet me all the time with questions like, &quot;Do you intend for &lt;spec&gt; to be lackluster this &lt;exp/tier&gt;?&quot; So silly. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492045689128374272))<br />
&quot;No, we're shooting for abysmal. More tuning to come!&quot;<br />
Haha. I'll use this next time I'm feeling especially snarky. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492046635170398208))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ideathknights.gif Death Knight (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/269-Death-Knight) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/death-knight) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#Y))<br />
Frost DKs: 2H will prefer to use KM on Oblit, and DW on FS, as has been intended for a while (but tuning was off in late MoP). (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491825861700489216))<br />
We know this, but there is no incentive wait for OB to come off CD to use KM on it. Its a dmg loss right now for doing so.<br />
Right, that's the part about &quot;tuning was off in late MoP&quot;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491835554401497088))<br />
how's it a tuning issue?<br />
It was not tuned to be worth it. That's a tuning issue. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491839901600477185))<br />
It's a mechanical issue. Not a tuning issue. Have to use runes to start the feedback loop.<br />
So? (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491840717048668161))<br />
Therefore KM can never &quot;matter&quot; to 2H Frost. Useless mechanic.<br />
Extreme example: Triple Oblit's damage. Now you will prefer to use KMs on Oblits. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491841434043949057))<br />
another example You are empty on runes w/ only runic power. You will still use KM on FS.<br />
Yes. That's why I said *prefer to*, not *only*. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491849047909470208))<br />
What will make Obl worth using in WoD for DW frost dk's?With enough mastery howling blast will do more dmg cause frost dmg scale<br />
Rime helps with this. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491861804369190912))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/idruids.gif Druid (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/forums/270-Druid) / Skills (http://beta.wowdb.com/spells/class-abilities/druid) / WoD Talent Calculator (http://beta.wowdb.com/talent-calculator#s))<br />
Whats the intent of Tiger's Fury change? Removal of need for macro? Concerned about PvP burst with midberserk TF for more nrg?<br />
You already could combine them as long as you knew to use TF first. It was a pointless limitation. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491726806383202304))<br />
<br />
Pool up to 100 -&gt; Berserk -&gt; Dump to 40 -&gt; TF -&gt; Dump to 0.<br />
Sure, you'll do that, which we're fine with. It's damage that you're going to use on Bite; worst Energy-&gt;Damage conversion. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491727585554874368))<br />
<br />
Can you expand a bit on the new MF/SF eclipse changes? Did the snapshot idea not work? I like the changes I'm just curious.<br />
Yeah, Eclipse is no longer snapshot. As such, you can now afford to use MF/SF as mobile damage options, without reducing DoT dmg. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491731564154204160))<br />
So, it looks like you recast the dots right before hitting opposite Eclipse to maintain uptime? At least MF.<br />
You can't recast both at any time. You only need to MF once at peak, and SF once at peak and once at start/end of Solar (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491835826595061760))<br />
<br />
Is Shooting Stars 5% for most recent MF and SF, or 5% for just whichever of those is most recently applied?<br />
5% for both. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491838851652923392))<br />

liking the new hunter raid CD, even if it doesn't benefit them<br />
It does, a little. Powershot and Focusing Shot. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491744485101948928))<br />
<br />
With the new Aspect of the Fox, could we have a little clarity on &quot;all spells&quot;?Will it include abilities like Focusing Shots?<br />
Yes. I'll clarify the tooltip with &quot;and abilities&quot;. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491744232281874432))<br />
Thank yooou, and one more question.Does it include items (i.e hearthstone)?<br />
Yes. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491745570768158720))<br />
<br />
Oh, hay. Is a dps cool down still being considered for SV?<br />
Not beyond what's in the talent tree and effectively available through ES pooling. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491747765660049408))<br />
<br />
is the new fox cd on global or off?<br />
In an upcoming build it'll be off the global, and usable while casting something else (like Spiritwalker's Grace is). (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/492003407910023168))<br />

any concerns that Empowered Seals force reti and protto juggle seals to keep all 2/3 buffs active or is the intended game play?<br />
That's the intention. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492041926011412480))<br />
any plans to make it feel less clunky atm created alot of seal switch reminds me of warrior stance dance<br />
No, that's the point; it's a talent to let you opt into seal twisting. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/492043118913388544))<br />

No. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491737260321017856))<br />

Is there a reason Dragon Roar is not on the AoE Knockback list for diminishing returns?<br />
I believe because of the extremely short nature of it; it'd be a penalty use, instead of a benefit. Same as the Charge stun. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491726641492549634))<br />
<br />
that was specifically TC damage going down 30%, not all damage. (Though arms could probably use a flat 30% cut)<br />
Yeah, I just meant TC damage going down 30%. All Arms damage is still going to go down across the board too, though. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491747976071507968))<br />
<br />
ie is TClap down to 10 rage now, with WW at 20, or is Tclap still at 15 while WW is 20?<br />
TClap at 10, WW at 20, MS at 20, Execute will use up to 30 additional rage instead of 50 (same total dmg). Slam is slightly... (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491739675548086272))<br />
...different; couldn't really reduce the rage cost of a 10 rage ability by 1/3. so instead increased its damage by 50%. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491739787657625600))<br />
is tclap intended to be used single target for arms now unless you take the slam talent?<br />
No, it's still much worse damage than WW. Tclap is primarily for the snare. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491743938605092864))<br />
Any chances TC radius glyph will make a return? Piercing howl has 15 yards radius. Fury won't have aoe snare?<br />
The WW range glyph will also apply to TC. (Celestalon (https://twitter.com/Celestalon/status/491856072148131841))<br />
<br />
PvE<br />
Any chance we might see Elite difficulty fights in WoD? Like Protectors in ToES. Loved Yogg Saron, would like to see more<br />
No specific plan in place for the 6.0 raid content, but it's something we can/will do where it makes sense. (WatcherDev (https://twitter.com/WatcherDev/status/492006024086175744))<br />
<br />
Lore<br />
Would you consider Khadgar, based on his views and persona, to be an Alliance character? Is he in the Alliance for convieniece?<br />
Khadgar is an Alliance character willing to give quests to individual Horde heroes he trusts. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492025336867979264))<br />
<br />
I don't get this. I can understand khadgar being neutral aligned because of his Outland experiences but the KT has never been fully neutral except in world-threatening circumstances. 3 of the 6 members of the current council of six were there when kael was thrown into the violet hold. Jaina does more face heel turns than a catwalk model but I think khadgar would be way outvoted<br />
He is. But that doesn't stop him from doing his thing. Would love to be a fly on the wall in Council meetings! (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492024610817187841))<br />
<br />
Hey any chance Exarch Naielle, Exarch Malaadar, and Yrel come back to the main universe and possibly exarch akama as well?<br />
Not determined yet! We'll see what people think of the exarchs. You'll meet other rangari in other zones, as well. (DaveKosak (https://twitter.com/DaveKosak/status/492024147115900928))<br />

<br />
It's not dealing with the fear. It's just if you're going to do that you might as well remove the totem or make the totem last longer (basically revert it back to the old Tremor Totem.) because as a CD it's pointless in PVP as a premptive that lasts only a few seconds. As a item you could use while feared it had actual use. IF someone is casting fear and I drop TT all they do is stop casting and I wasted the CD and then they would just cast fear again and TT is wasted.</div></div><hr />

Nope. It's just disappointing that someone who is interacting with the community and also somewhat responsible for the direction of the game has the flaws that he has.

<br />
How is that actually a wasted CD in that case? It's not like the totem instantly disappears, so you prevent getting feared when you do not want to get feared, so when you use the ability properly and you don't actually waste anything.<br />
<br />
As a shaman I welcome this change. I liked it when using tremor totem required a bit of thinking, instead of just dropping it as soon as you get feared. I do think they should increase the duration of the totem a bit but this will probably happen eventually if they are trying to change the totem back to the way it was.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're putting a tiny bit of skill back into the game.<br />
<br />
To be honest: yes and no.<br />
<br />
Yes in the way that the current tremor totem is a rather easy &quot;get out of jail free card&quot;. Especially with the upcoming reduction in CC, I could see how they want to tackle Tremor.<br />
<br />
However, there are some issues:<br />
1) Tremor would need a significant duration increase if it's not going to be usable while crowd controlled. Without duration increase the totem (which only lasts 6 seconds) would be practically worthless. The old duration used to be 2 minutes (and even changed up to 5 minutes in WotLK)<br />
<br />
2) Tremor totem without the instant dispel used to be a major source of headaches, because of the totem &quot;pulse&quot; mechanics. Back in the days tremor totem would only pulse once every 4 seconds (later decreased to 3 seconds) meaning you would often still be eating the majority of the CC because of this. In fact I remember some pvp scenarios where the warlock would fear a shaman, and then have enough time in between pulses to 1 shot the totem leading to a full CC train.<br />
<br />
Frankly though; I don't see how this is useful when the totem is only up for 6 seconds. Especially combined with the fact that even with it down you might still be feared/charmed/sleeped for a long while as the totem works in pulses. Hell, if you're unlucky enough you might have the totem down exactly when you need it but get screwed by timing and the totem just fades without helping. I see a lot of incoming frustration, just like with the old Tremor.<br />
<br />
This won't work unless the compensate in some way.a<br />

I love seeing someone tell the devs how fucked up killing machine procs are for 2h frost DKs<br />
<br />
Only currently due to scaling, just as Celestalon said.<br />
IMO he's largely on the ball with the things he mentioned in these posts.<br />
<br />
KM can be made good again for 2H Oblit, as long as you get the numbers right. Pooling KM for a few seconds wouldn't be harmful as long as the damage gain is big enough to offset the chance of wasting procs.<br />
Similarly for DW Obliterate can be made worthwhile again by tweaking Rime.<br />
<br />
People keep shouting that all the issues with Frost are mechanical flaws, when they're in fact mostly scaling issues. Most of these mechanics worked fine up until 5.3-5.4, purely because mastery scaling made frost strike and HB do so much damage.</div></div><hr />

It would make no sense if you can claim your Horde chopper (available at WoD launch, not pre-patch!) until Sept 30, 2014 and WoD is released later. It seems much more likely that there is a 1-week goodwill period included, which would put the WoD release on Sept 23, 2014 (a Tuesday btw). Also, the official WoD Brady Games guides is released on Sept 23, 2014 as well (see Amazon).</div></div><hr />

Or if you have an alt with 12k coins ... ding ding.<br />
<br />
But I totally agree with the folks asking for the weekly capped to be removed or increased. That would be pretty cool to farm up 3 or 4k VP in a week.</div></div><hr />

It seems much more likely that there is a 1-week goodwill period included, which would put the WoD release on Sept 23, 2014 (a Tuesday btw). Also, the official WoD Brady Games guides is released on Sept 23, 2014 as well (see Amazon).<br />

Nothing is free, the chopper is obviously a way for them to get people to subscribe again. People will already come back for WoD, no need to tempt them with a free mount. Why Sept 30? Because that's the last day of the 4th quarter in a fiscal year, so likely an attempt to boost the subscriber count for this quarter. Sure, a dirty trick, but surely effective to have better numbers at the next earnings call.<br />
<br />
As I previously said, they're more or less required to give distributors and stores a two months heads up. September is really out of the question.</div></div><hr />

Yeah, we have that under the hood for emergencies (see Brewmasters on live). Results in a more cohesive game if we don't tho<br />
<br />
Wasn't that exactly what Mastery was supposed to be when introduced? It is a singular value that modifies a bunch of spells and they can easily tweak the dps output of a class by adjusting the scaling slightly.</div></div><hr />

No, it was not designed with that in mind. It was designed to give Spriests the highest &quot;execute&quot; range in the game (20% is lower than some, but SW:D double tap plus more orb gen... which has it's serious problems (which are being resolved FINALLY), helped make up for it. Glad to see the deaths of the &quot;niche&quot; play styles and a more core focus on mechanics and interacting with the game. &quot;Niche-ing&quot; doesn't make you pro bro, it just makes the class poorly designed (like the fact we've been encouraged to clip Mind Flay for years, rather than channel it to completion (putting a damage buff on it for completing the cast would have worked come to think of it...) has been a huge pebble in my shoe. All praise be to the Corporate powers that exorcised GC.<br />
<br />
There really wasn't a point to change that anymore.. it was good game mechanic to cast my penance on a low target instead of the boss to proc twist of fate.. now it's really only for healing targets, which sucks. With the removal of the damage component from T90 talents, it was already going to be more complicated to keep it up.<br />
<br />
It's another major disc nerf, they already put that on same tier as Spirit Shell, so there is no way in hell Twist of Fate will be used by disc priest now, unless there is a gimmick mechanic in the fight.</div></div><hr />

In just a few hours yesterday I nearly capped it. The problem is I am playing on a new server for WoD and trying to do the Black Prince quests again, so I have to wait 4 weeks to get 3k valor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're putting a tiny bit of skill back into the game.<br />
<br />
But they're dumbing down all the skills?</div></div><hr />

<br />
why do people still try to cling straws that are proofen to not hold *no offense meant*<br />
the 2 months for distributors is not a can be its a must be, they don't give them 2 months they won't carry the game ....<br />
and not even blizzard can release an expansion without the distribuors<br />
<br />
if they would announce the release today the earliest day would be 30th of september, if they announce it at gamescon 25th of october, but tbh they still have Wod in alpha from all the information and not in beta, i don't believe any estimate before at least middle - end of november more likely closer to christmas.</div></div><hr />

Oh well, WoW is dead for me, let's move on to CS:GO peeps !</div></div><hr />
