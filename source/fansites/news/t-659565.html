<br />
Upcoming Upper Deck TCG Mount Changes<br />
I announced that a few weeks ago, this is now confirmed.<br />
In the upcoming content patch 3.2, Call of the Crusade, we are changing the Upper Deck Trading Card Game mounts to be Bind-on-Use instead of Bind-on-Pickup. This will allow players to sell newly redeemed TCG mounts in-game through the trade window, Auction House or via CoD. The primary goal behind this change is to help reduce the number of players who are getting scammed by trading for an invalid mount code. As part of this update, the NPC vendor functionality currently in place for these mounts will be removed, and instead the mount (both epic and non-epic when applicable), will now be immediately placed in your inventory upon the verified redemption of the code. If you have already redeemed one of these codes and have not purchased both the epic and non-epic versions from the vendor window, it's important that you do so before the patch is released.<br />
<br />
This update will affect the Spectral Tiger, Swift Spectral Tiger, X-51 Nether-Rocket, X-51 Nether-Rocket X-TREME, Big Battle Bear, and Magic Rooster Egg. Items that were obtained before the patch will not be affected by this change and will continue to be soulbound to the character that purchased them. <br />
<br />
Patch 3.2 - PTR Build 10192<br />
Another build has been deployed on the test realms today, it really looks like Blizzard wants to release the patch next week and is trying to fix as many bugs as possible.<br />
The PTR servers have been updated to a new build and should be available once again for testing.<br />
<br />
You'll need to patch your client before being able to connect to the servers.<br />
<br />
The new build on the PTR is 0.2.0.10192.<br />
<br />
Upcoming Data Survey<br />
We plan to begin collecting non-personal system specifications data from all World of Warcraft players again in the very near future. Players who have not merged their World of Warcraft account with a Battle.net account will see a message stating, &quot;Submitting non-personal system information&quot;. However, those who are playing with a Battle.net account will not see this message even though the system data is being gathered. This process will run for approximately one week. Please also rest assured that this data survey will have absolutely no affect on gameplay.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
It does and it doesn't. They are very careful about what it's affecting and all those items are expensive in dollars terms. There is a hard gold cap of 214k. It's difficult for me to believe that a tiger will sell for an amount under that gold cap. Not when you could sell it for $1400 on ebay. The roster and bear probably will sell on AH. But the people who have that amount of gold is very limited.<br />
<br />
I think the bigger issue is what secondary effect it will have. If people are more tempted to buy from gold sellers so they can buy the mount in the first place and thus more accounts get compromised and thus more work for Blizzard, that is going to be an issue. But I for one am not convinced that there will be that much push back. I guess we'll all find out.</div></div><hr />

Nop. And a lot of people yelled at me because of that lately :p<br />
<br />
And I'm not sure if it will be delayed or not, right now you can't use flying mounts anymore in Northrend. It doesn't look good. (Nevermind, fixed.)</div></div><hr />

&quot;Conquest&quot; is the suffix used for the name of all parts of the ilvl 232 items, it doesn't mean that you can buy it with Emblems of Conquest.</div></div><hr />

There is no mention of it on the T9 page except for ilvl 258. Surely they don't expect the vast majority of the player base to farm 210 badges (from 5 bosses - and heroics, le sigh) just to fill out one tier set....<br />
<br />
I'm not necessarily complaining, I just don't like the notion of farming badges for the latest tier of gear.</div></div><hr />

Not really, since there still has to be a buyer.<br />
And the prices for these items will be so high that close to no-one will buy one.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Before people who were working and had an income could buy the mount code from eBay or just buy shed-loads of card packs in hope of the code.<br />
<br />
With this change it'll fall in to the hands of auction players who are rolling around with stupid amounts of gold.<br />
<br />
Personally I think they should have left it as it was and spent their time clamping down on the scammers.<br />
Also, if anyone is stupid enough to even be scammed by what was going on they deserved it tbh.<br />
<br />
And now when someone does have the code, they will have both 60% and 100% mounts available to sell.<br />
So that will now mean we have to buy both. Why not make them like Headless Horseman's mount that auto switches based on trained mount skill.<br />
<br />
I don't know about anyone else but it seems like another &quot;easy way out&quot; rather than spending time doing something about the scammers in the first place.<br />
<br />
*edit* Oh, and bring out the in-game economy unbalance with this as well.<br />

<br />
<br />
Blizzard never said &quot;3.2 = s7&quot;. You fail to realize why they did tend to start new season with new big patches - from day 1 you had the option to go hard mode and get hard mode weapons, which could be considered OP in PvP and result in a lot of QQing (as if we aren't seeing that all the time).<br />
<br />
However in patch 3.2 you won't be able to do any hard mode whatsoever for 4 to 5 weeks (still a bit unclear whether you can start hard modes in week 4 or week 5). One boss becomes available every week, and until you kill Anub (week 4) you can't go into hard mode Coliseum. <br />
<br />
Thus, your claim (cause, again, Blizzard never said it) that &quot;3.2 = s7&quot; is quite wrong :)</div></div><hr />

Exactly what you see on the item lvl table on the T9 page on this site. So no, normal modes don't drop the token.<br />

232 - badges only, 245 - badges + trophy (normal 25, possibly hard 10), 258 - a regalia token from hard 25 (1 token = any piece of T9, no longer a specific token for each part). It's all pretty clear if you look at the T9 section on mmochamp.</div></div><hr />

<br />

<br />
<br />
Most likely reward from killing Anub on 25m heroic.<br />
<br />
As far as I understand tokens for tier pieces will drop only from heroic version of 25m, which means that every boss has to be killed on hard mode. <br />
<br />
To obtain non-hardmode tier you have to get VERY large amount of emblems + trophy. How many badges will there drop on 25 normal version? I'm a bit scared because even if they would keep usual ~20 emblems per full clear it would mean we would have to fully clear this raid for over 15 weeks to get a set. I'm not counting daily heroic, blizz made major mistake making probably full ilvl226 players clear daily heroic ilvl200 dungeons just for stupid emblems. <br />
<br />
Please tell me that I'm wrong at some point because from what I understand now, it will take way less time to gather non-set items while most tier bonuses suck anyway.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Actually casuals will probably have some pieces of T9 before the raiders.<br />
Since 1 boss will be unlocked each week and heroic version will require that the normal mode cleared, in 5 weeks:<br />
a &quot;pure&quot; raider will get: 4 + 8 + 12 + 16 + 20 = 60 EoT<br />
a &quot;pure&quot; casual doing only daily heroics will get: 2 * 7 * 5 = 70 EoT<br />
<br />
Since a raider will probably aim at least at Triumph (ilevel 245) T9, he will get only one piece in 5 weeks, while a casual will get Conqueror's Shoulders + Hands.<br />
<br />
Obviously pure raiders and pure casuals don't exist (everyone will probably do raids + heroics), but still...</div></div><hr />

I guess you guys figure: Person buys TCG mount on eBay -&gt; Person receives code -&gt; Person then redeems code and sells for gold.<br />
<br />
OMG LEGAL GOLD BUYING!<br />
<br />
But before you could've just done: Person buys TCG mount on eBay -&gt; Person receives code -&gt; Person DOESN'T redeem the code, but sells the code for gold.<br />
<br />
Of course you'd have to take their word for it that the code is legit. Now you can safely use the trade interface to trade for the mount.<br />
<br />
All Blizzard hopes is that people will try to get the mount in game for gold instead of potentially getting scammed and lose real $$$ because eBay and other such sites are BS. <br />
<br />
Which isn't likely to happen. Because gee if you got a TCG mount and know there are people willing to spend cash for it? $$$ &gt; WoW gold.</div></div><hr />

Fail man... since when doing &quot;level 80 lolroics&quot; in wotlk is something? Glad that people will at least still have to enter the correct raid to get the current Tier (or keep farming 2 triumph per day instead of farm lolroics and lolramas).<br />

Guess normal players want to keep going on the xpac story, not get locked on the same heroics or &quot;karazhan&quot; for the rest of the xpac duration (not the &quot;epeeners&quot; that just want the latest shining gear to show, because they don't do the dungeon where that gear would be useful. Yes, wanting the gear from a dungeon you don't want to do/can't do, just because it's current top to show in IF/Org is stupid epeen.).<br />
<br />
Yes, they did what they said they would NEVER do again... New tier gear bought with currency from starter dungeons, A.K.A Badges of Justice.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard really expects that everyone waste time again in wow doing everything, not only raid or only heroics. It's their choice of action for &quot;please, come back and play, look, shiny epics!&quot;. They're even allowing players to buy the so powerfull and most &quot;notable and desired&quot; part of the Tier sets, the shoulder, for the same as the usually cheaper part (hands).<br />

<br />
---<br />
<br />
There are two key factors that are not being accounted for. There is no gold generation here, gold is not being added to the economy, but rather being transfered. But really, is it worth selling a Spectral Tiger card for WoW gold? Lets look at the numbers.<br />
<br />
There is a 'express' service that activly advertises on my server. They post prices of about $80 for 10,000 gold. Using that as a base, and knowing the gold cap is about 216k, we X 80 by 21.6 giving us $1728. now everyone can log onto eBay and see that the card goes for about $1000, so if all holds true we would see prices for a swift at about 108,000 gold. Will people pay that? You bet. Why? Becasue there are some people who have gotten that gold legit!<br />
<br />
Also remember the value of the card can only be compared agains the method of aquisition. I was lucky enough to get a Spectral card in a booster pack two years ago on boxing day. For me it was a simple choice, as the $1000 I got for it payed for almost half of my University tuition for the semister. But really it held a value of $5 which was the cost of the booster. For those that aquire the card in this manor the value could be far less and translate into AH prices in the mid to high 10's. <br />
<br />
Regardless there are only going to be a handfull of people that will be able to get one of these, many more for the more common mounts such as the rocket or bear. <br />
<br />
Its not the person who is buying it we have to worry about, its the person who is getting the gold and what they decided to do with it that will cause the most havoc. With 100,000 gold one could do some serious damage to the economy for a small amount of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Don't you worry, my fear mongering bigot friend.<br />
<br />
I'm one of those players who runs 25-man versions of raids - with 24 other devoted players. Gotten my 4/5 T8 by working for it, cleared Ulduar, had the privilege of seeing Yogg-Saron - and killing him. Just like I did my raids back in 'the good ol' days' and in TBC up to Kil'Jaeden.<br />
<br />
But I'm also one of those guys who just finds it piss-your-pants funny every time he reads people on the forums showing off their fear of 'welfare players'. Who, nearly to the point of it being a crusade, try to fend off any progress in item advancement for all players just because it would mean they are no longer 'as unique' in what they do.<br />
<br />
What else do you want ? People who just entered the game, rerolled a toon or people not fortunate enough to be in my position to have nothing ? No progress ? No, what you lovely adressed, 'advancement' in the game's 'story' ? Because that's what it would be if people like you would still force mainly casuals and newcomers to be stuck in the old (3.0) dungeons, trying to obtain their gear. And no fear, with badges you can only get minimal acceptable items, even in 3.2, so these people would still have to run at least Ulduar.<br />
<br />
Unless you're not in the fortunate position of having the choice of all the items in the game, you have no place to tell less fortunate people how they ought to be playing this game.<br />
<br />

If you think you are better than everyone else cause you have the highest ilvl epics in game, get off your butt and enter the real world for a bit (1week) and you will realize they aren't as important as you think.<br />
If that's all you care about is vanity they have every right just to be as you and look PRETTY lol.<br />
&quot;OMG that guy who has no achievements in Ulduar has 2 pieces the same gear as me, he probably hasn't even entered the instance&quot;.<br />
I agree with Blizzard and this step all the way, it's the shallow people wanting others to look at their characters and the need for attention and envy upon them that they care for.<br />
If you are truly a great player you would accept this, and let others enjoy what you have experienced, instead of being ignorant and conceited.</div></div><hr />

i cut your post down as it really just reiterates your first 2 sentences over and over.<br />
<br />
I think most &quot;hardcore&quot; raiders don't have an issue with loot being available over time to people who put less effort into the game and play it more &quot;casual&quot;. The main issue is the work-to-reward ratio, and its been getting closer and closer that gets hardcores more annoyed than anything else.<br />
<br />
<br />
Imagine you're back in school, and its a scheduled test day in your first class in the morning. You show up, and start the test, worked your hardest, had studied the night before and finished early and start to check your answers. 15mins from the end of the hour long test a guy arrives late, grabs his test and gets to work. You hand your test in, completed, he hands his test in, and tells you as he exits that he only managed to finish half the test.<br />
<br />
The next day, your grades are posted, you scored and 95%, he receives an 80%. You wonder: &quot;what the hell? he only finished half the test!&quot;. As it turned out, the teacher decided to &quot;only grade him on what he completed&quot; instead of the entire test, and docked him half a letter grade(5%) down. <br />
<br />
^^^Essentially the difference between the hard-core and casual attitude as i see it. <br />
<br />
He worked for 1/4th the time, scored lower (on the part he DID complete) yet is awarded a fair and passing grade.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah, school analogy, but i think its fitting here at least(and many people can relate to how this might feel as im sure most of us reading these forums have gone to high school at the least, most probably more)</div></div><hr />

As it turned out, the teacher decided to &quot;only grade him on what he completed&quot; instead of the entire test, and docked him half a letter grade(5%) down. <br />
<br />
^^^Essentially the difference between the hard-core and casual attitude as i see it. <br />
<br />
He worked for 1/4th the time, scored lower (on the part he DID complete) yet is awarded a fair and passing grade.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah yeah, school analogy, but i think its fitting here at least(and many people can relate to how this might feel as im sure most of us reading these forums have gone to high school at the least, most probably more)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Well I understand what your getting at, but to be honest your analogy is a very &quot;poor&quot; example. And shows your completely missing the point of why Blizzard is doing this, and also shows (imo at least) that your giving yourself way too much credit for raiding. <br />
<br />
You like many other people try to make it like casual=less effort in the game, and also make the unspoken assumption that raiders cant be casual. But realistically the time you put into WoW can in no way reflects how good you are as a player, let alone the gear you are wearing. Because face it, there are people that play 5-10 hours a week that barley do heroics, and then there are people that play 5-10 hours a week that clear naxx and attempt/clear ulduar. Both casual players.<br />
<br />
Now as for the badge loot i see no reason for anybody to complain. Because if you are the elitist raider that you claim to be, you should be shooting for the ivl 245/258 tier 9 which you HAVE to raid the Coliseum to get. Not to mention if your raiding you will have the potential of getting more badges then somebody &quot;just&quot; doing heroics for 2 badges a day, max of 14 badges a week. Vs a raider that will be getting 14 badges a week from heroic daily's , badges from every version of the raid (10,10H, 25, 25H) and on top of that all the rest of the t9 ilvl gear that will be dropping from raiding. <br />
<br />
So in the end your arguing if its &quot;fair&quot; that people that don't have the time/gear equivalent to raid t9 to have the ability to very slowly get a max of 8 pieces of t9 ilvl equivalent gear. Which would only take 155 days to do &gt;.&lt;</div></div><hr />

That just means your computer is not &quot;average&quot; as far as people who play wow go. (neither is mine, I had to turn settings way down)</div></div><hr />

<br />
And well, Bliz is known to scale his games down to below &quot;average&quot; actually. I would guess that they aim at a rough 80% or so that can play with medium settings and get a decent framerate. If you compare WoW to competitors the requirements are way low to run it. <br />
<br />
They do have some problems for the higher end which a survey might point out as being worthwhile to develop for. SLI/Crossfire and multimonitor support are major ones I can think of that are currently lacking yet are becoming more mainstream for average gamers.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yeah, kinda sucks that I have to turn SLI off, because with SLI on game constantly locks up and crashes. It's very unplayable, while all problems disappear when I turn SLI off.</div></div><hr />
