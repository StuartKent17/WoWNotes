Season 2 Team Qualification<br />
A few days ago, Blizzard announced that they will &quot;filter&quot; inactive arena teams before giving out arena season 2 rewards, Drysc posted an explanation about this.<br />
While the date for the end of Season 2 has not yet been announced, we wanted to let everyone know beforehand about a change to the requirements for a team to be counted towards the total teams considered for the end of season rewards.<br />
<br />
Our goal with this change is to remove teams from being counted that could not already be eligible for the end of season rewards. By not counting them we’re effectively limiting the pool of teams that are added up before calculating the final 0.5% for the end of season rewards.<br />
<br />
The requirements for a team to be counted (both requirements must be met):<br />
The team must have played at least 20 games during the season.<br />
The team must have at least one player that has played in 20% or more of the total games for that team.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
As the requirement to be eligible for the end of season rewards is also 20% participation for the entire season, this overlap merely ensures that teams that have active and eligible members will be counted.<br />
<br />
Focused Will changes<br />
Focused Will (http://www.mmo-champion.com/images/news/2007/october/focusedwill.jpg) is being changed.<br />
We wanted you to know that we're going to be redesigning the new discipline talent, focused will, so please hold off on providing further feedback on the ability until the new version is announced and/or it's pushed to the public test realms. The goal of the talent will still focus on survivability.<br />
<br />
The intention of this talent is provide an alternative to the holy talent, blessed resilience, so the priest who desires a talent of this nature has more than one option, adding more flexibility to the talent choices they make leading up to either.

<br />
BG Daily quests will reward 400 honor, not 4000<br />
This will probably make a lot of people sad, but it seems that the BG Daily quests rewards are totally wrong, they're supposed to reward 400 honor points, not 2000 or 4000 like what we saw in previous builds. <br />
It's off by a factor of 10. Battleground Daily quest bonus honor is supposed to be equivalent to 20 player kills at your level, ie 400 honor at level 70.<br />
<br />
It's more or less a free battleground worth of honor, and that's what we've intended it to be. A bonus for hopping in that day's battleground.<br />
<br />
There's a lot of concern that AV isn't providing as much honor as it is on live due to the changes on the PTR. Some changes have already gone in but we're still keeping track of and willing to make additional changes. We want the time/honor ratio of AV to be as close to what it is now as possible, and if it looks like that's not the case even after bumping the honor and decreasing the amount of resources then we'll make additional changes.<br />

Guild Banks<br />
If leadership of a guild is transfered the new leader now has full access to the guild bank. If the guild is disbanded the current guild leader gets all the items in the bank via his mailbox. If the guild leader was banned, you would most likely need to contact a GM to get leadership transfered.

This is not about they got something wrong on PTR, this is about they add something that doesnt even work with their own rules.<br />
<br />
Here is an example to make it easier to figure out<br />
<br />
<br />
- You are able to eat 25 burgers per day before you get stuffed (crit dmg reduction cap)<br />
- You are sponsorized by BigBurger. They give you 25 burgers per day (you reached the cap via resilience)<br />
- Now BiggerBigBurger offer you to sell you 30 burgers per day. (This talent)<br />
<br />
Not only they want to sell you more burger than what you can eat per day, but you really dont need it due to your sponsor.</div></div><hr />

You don't have to look at the price. 46.5 DPS &gt; 43 DPS, that's all. So you take the 46.5 DPS version.<br />
When you put armor on your legs, do you take the +50pa/12cc or the 40pa/10cc. You take the best because you need to DPS in instances. <br />

i've never read something about an ingame cap. it's just a resilence-cap. by your logic, belssed resilence would be against game-mechanics as well, because it reduces the chance of being hit with crits FAR beyond the resilence-capped-number^^<br />
<br />
@ season 2 quali:<br />
<br />
it's impossible to get anywhere near the top .5 % with only 20 wins. but how is this any different from season 1 qualification? and how does it prevent inactive team from getting their titles?</div></div><hr />

<br />
It has been test on PTR and there is an ingame cap. Resilience doesnt cap cause it is resilience, it cap due to the game mechanic.<br />

<br />
Yeah, but suppose there are 2000 teams in a battlegroup, 1000 of which are inactive, by omitting the inactive teams you end up with 5 teams getting the Gladiator title, if you include them you end up with 10 teams and so on down having twice as many teams at each title bracket. Obviously the numbers will vary depending on the ratio of active to inactive teams but the idea is that titles are allocated based on the number of active teams, not on the total number of teams.</div></div><hr />

No its not much easier to get higher rating. Its waaaaay harder. What I am saying is that THE JOB of PvErs is WAAAAYY more easy and the access of PvPrs on PvE content is waaaay harder. All this makes PvErs MUCH more priviledged thats what am saying. In conclusion, as a PvEr you have WAAAY more options and alternatives to gear up compared to Pvprs</div></div><hr />

How can you argue that PvE is both easier and harder in the same paragraph? A PvP player can do some PvE on the side just as easily as a PvE player can do some PvP on the side. Or are you trying to say that PvE becomes somehow harder if you also PvP? Or are you just reducing everything to do with PvE to the single act of getting the mats for your tier 3 BS weapons?</div></div><hr />

Hmm. LOL @ PvE being easy. Wow! Blizzard must totally hate PvP! :/ I mean.. With all this time it actually takes to get honor and arena points, how long can it be before they make you take DURABILITY!! OH NOES! I hope that you Flask and pot up for your next BG. The amount of time and money spent on PvE FAR exceeds that of time spent in PvP to get gear. That combined with sometimes horrid drop rates makes raiding difficult. Getting people to listen up and pay attention in raids and taking deaths that actually cost the player gold lend to some long hours to get those shiny epics. <br />
<br />
I would like to see these options and alternatives for getting gear that you have so kindly laid out for us PvE'rs. My mage has to fight against 2 other mages 3 locks and a boomkin that likes the feel of cloth. My paladin has DPS warriors rolling on things that might help me farm for gold that I lose to durability. Not to mention the other Holy Paladins that would like some nice gear too. <br />
<br />
So. In conclusion, if you are hardcore PvE, you have limited in game time that isn't spent raiding. Be thankful for the easy epics that you are getting doing your PVP. I have my Merc Glad Salv, and several pieces of it.. And it only put in my ten games a week in 3v3. Any my Raiting BARELY gets over 1600. And guess what? It only takes about an hour on Thursday! OMG!

<br />
okay. but how do they determine which teams are inactive? just based on those 20 games and 20% attendance?<br />
<br />
@ wildhorn<br />
<br />
it is definitely not a game mechanic. i've asked several gms today. even the shaman talent (that new one, forgot the name^^) reduces dmg taken by 30%... i wonder were u got that information from^^</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yup, so it would seem. If your team has 200 games played and no existing player has played 40 or more you don't count and won't get titles for that bracket. If your team has played less than 20 games this season same applies.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
<br />
No Sir. I proved MY point. And I think you have confused my point with his.<br />
<br />
Mr. Felix's comment/point was to say that the role of a PvE'r basically is easy and offers no real challenge, and that its way harder to get a decent arena rating than it is to farm 25 man raid content. Which IMO is totally inaccurate. <br />
<br />
As I stated raiders like myself need to deal with repairs, as well as pots/flasks especially for encounters we are learning or haven't quite gotten on farm. <br />
<br />
An easy night of raiding leave me with:<br />
2 stacks of mana pots used: 40g on Shu'halo on AH.<br />
Repair from wipes learning a new boss: 35g easy, and not fully broken.<br />
Flasks/Elixirs/Food. Easily another 40g for the night.<br />
<br />
And it seems all the PvPer's are worried about are a few Nether Vortex. I admit, there are a lot of variables in PvP that make it an ever changing event that is random at all times. But in PvP can 1 person do something wrong and simultaneously cause the death of everyone on your team? No.<br />
<br />
<br />
I say that to say this: The PvEer must put in MORE time/effort to get gear than the PvPer. <br />
Whether it be farming for gold/mats, or actually in an instance learning encounters and killing bosses.<br />
<br />
Making PvP easier makes no sense to me, and I personally think that it is just fine the way it is. <br />
<br />
Everyone is QQing about it not being 4000 honor points! Well I say that if the reward is 400 be happy! You can't get those 400 points anywhere else, and if im not mistaken the quest rewards gold too. Sounds like a few of you are just looking for handouts...</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Kozikk</div><div class="date">2007-10-30, 04:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">For all those bitching about PvE vs PvP, I laugh at you. Yes, raiders have more options for gear. Do you know why? Because we do more!! Blizz already gives you weekends to help you farm honor. This weekend I farmed over 15k honor without locking myself in my room (please don't take that literally). The simple concept is that, when doing PvP, you are guaranteed to get gear at some point. Even if you have a dismal 1000 arena rating, you still get points, that cannot get taken away from you. When raiding, if you do not perform well, you don't kill a boss, and do not get anything, (and spend a ton of gold on repairs). If you want to compare the rate that we receive loot, teams with 2k rating and higher can get a piece of gear every other week. That is WAY above the average for raiding. If you want to make things even, sure, give more honor, but also allow all consumables, and every time you die, slap a 4g repair cost on that. I spend 80 gold a night to raid (raiding 5 days a week). Seeing as I average getting a single piece of gear every 2 or 3 weeks, that is somewhere around 1000 gold every piece of gear I get, not counting enchants and such. <br />
<br />
What is my point in all this? Simply that the same principles apply for both PvE and PvP. Time + effort + a dash of skill = phat lootz. Things may never be &quot;perfectly fair&quot;, but we will all agree that things are much more even than in previous MMO's. I think rather than all the QQ about how one thing is easier than another, we should focus on how to improve aspects of the game, but in a civilized manner. I would like to think we are a little better than the U.S. Congress.....</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
You don't pvp much do you? Every global cooldown from every person on your arena team is important. You don't just have to have situational awareness and know how to keep yourself alive and do your job like you do in PvE. In PvP you need to protect your teammates, which is something that does not exist (other than the tank) in PvE. <br />
<br />
Any discussion of PvP vs PvE is worthless and a waste of time. People always bring the conversation down to be about loot. Loot should not be what this game is about. It is unfortunate that everything in this game is always brought down to &quot;what item do I get out of it?&quot;. No one does anything for fun anymore. The people that want more bonus honor from BGs just want to reduce the insane amount of boring grinding they have to do so that they can go have fun in the arena. <br />
<br />
It'd be like saying &quot;You can get tier 7 in that new raid, but if you want new bracers, belt, boots, cloak, ring, and neck you have to go do molten core!&quot;<br />
<br />
What if raiders needed to go spend ~100 hours grinding mobs somewhere every few months just to keep doing what you're doing. Not just once, but every time a new big patch comes out, and you have to do it with all of your characters. Eventually you're going to get really sick of doing it. I didn't mind getting the honor gear on my hunter in season 1 and it wasn't too bad to do it for my warlock for season 2 and currently I'm working on honor for my priest for season 3. But I don't have time to gear out all my characters for every season just so that I can do arena with them. I can go into a raid and get items to replace my gear even if some of my pieces are a bit out dated. But I can't do arena to replace my gear. I have to do BGs which are old and boring.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Then you dont PvE much do you? Whats this about ~100 hours grinding a mob? You mean like farming an instance? <br />
<br />
We don't have to protect each other? You mean I don't have to heal the AoE damage to keep the dps alive? Or BoP a lazy rogue not using Faint because hes pulling to much aggro?<br />
<br />
And everytime a big patch comes out? You mean like when Blizzard releases new raid content right? And we have to learn it and farm it? LoL sounds like someone is angry. I have plenty of PvP gear, and none of it was very difficult to get. I have fun in arenas/BG's but it isn't as hard/time consuming as PvE You say that every GCD counts for your team, maybe it does when your at 1900 rating, but I stated that My best arena team stays just above 1600.. And guess what.. I cleanse Unstable Affiction ALL THE TIME and we can still win. And one noob warrior dying in EoTS won't cause everyone else to die, but if one noob hunter puts MD on the wrong person and pulls that spells doom. Maybe the S3 rating req will put a lockdown on these free epics, but for now, they are just that.. Free Epics. You get them if you WIN OR NOT. In PvE you have to WIN to get ANYTHING.<br />
<br />
And as far as fun goes... Getting loot is fun! You know why? Because i have fun learning and seeing all the new content that Blizzard gives us. And to go there and have a good time I have to have decent gear. Gear that I shed blood money and tears for.</div></div><hr />

I find it fun experiencing the lore advance in what little ways it can, I play because I'm a Warcraft fan and I love the universe, and I really wish all the Halo nerds would go back to Halo and stop transmogrifying my series into something its not, a PvP oriented game where lore and story mean nothing.</div></div><hr />

<br />
pve-content is made for being mastered. in my eyes it's like a puzzle. 80% coordination. and for those 5% guilds, who actually work out strategies and get world firsts, it may be some challenge in regards of not knowing what the mob will do. for most os th guilds out there, it's about perfecting a game-plan, a tactic which they've read somewhere in the www. earlier in the game, with 40-man-raidinstances, the margin for errors was bigger, so that if 3-4 guys weren't paying attention, the other could step in. nowadays there's only a small or none at all. that's what makes rading difficult. to get 25 players to perform (near to ) flawless.<br />
<br />
i don't get how anyone here could say, wow is pve only? i mean y are there 2 factions? <br />
<br />
i love pvp'ing and can say without a doubt, it's NOT easy to perform at the top of your server... as is pve.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Longtooth</div><div class="date">2007-10-31, 09:55 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">About PvP anmd PvE it is actually what you preffer and i can not blame Blizzard that i preffer PvE more than PvP <br />
<br />
However i still do arena and BG's everytime that i can so i can get some gear that will improve my PvE performance either using it in the PvE encounter or while grinding for the same since it is way easier for me to grind in PvE gear yes <br />
Mana regen and critical hits but when you get backstabbed having equipped all your PvP gear becomes more important :D ofc that is on a PvP realm but still i don't go farming with 3 empty bags and i wear all the PvP gear that i equip in my bags for such situations <br />
<br />
So it basicly comes to what you want to play and how much you want to invest in it:<br />
Either you play some PvE (Heroics and maybe Karazhan) and you get to wear the PvE gear you manage to roll for or invest more money and time to 25 man raids etc.<br />
Or you go play some BG semiinactive or PvP in Arenas keeping a team of 1500 raiting or so and still be able to equip almost everything needed except the new weapons (BUT YOU CAN STILL USE THE OLD ONES) and the difference of using the old ones is not that HUGE as people describe it to be for a PvPer since <br />
<br />
To PvP you also need the skill and to get to the rating of 2000 you need the skill to be there (except for warlocks) ;D <br />
<br />
====================<br />
<br />
Abaut the arrows if you are a hunter and know how dps Calculation is measured then you probably realise that 3.5 dps difference is not that huge a difference in a raid where the hunter puts a 1500+ dps :) so on my server a 5x200 arrows will be worth around 3 gold to a non miner like me if you play it wise wich is aprox 60 s for 200 arrows wich is in between the CE and the VE arrows still if i manage to free the 3 big 20 slots bags that i have so i cna buy more VE arrows i will not be using them for grinding and will have to get rid of all the things in my bank so i can hold them and save the time to fly to Karazhan every so often ...<br />
<br />
Where the good engeneering arrows come stackign 1000 pieces in 1 single slot and being able to stack them in ALTs ... <br />
<br />
I am deffientely going to be using them <br />
Oh and yes i raid with normal arrows atm not the CE ones and i still manage to put one of the top 3 spots in teh DMG metters along with 2 other hunters in our 25 man raids and that is even without using macros and etc. <br />
<br />
So GCome on Blizz release thsi content already :)</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. Again I'm not the angry one :). I'm simply tired of hearing strictly PvPer's complaining about having to get new gear each time a patch comes out. LOL i love upgrades. And I fail to see the point of continuing to play the game if you have all the gear and there are no hopes for future upgrades. <br />
<br />
I love PvP as well. But as much as Blizzard likes to bow to the unhappy PvPer's with specs and such, WoW will never be a PvP game. They have made that much clear in the way the game works. <br />
<br />
Arena was a big step, but I see many folks finding more suitable atmosphere in say Warhammer for PvP.</div></div><hr />

You're not alone bro. That pretty much sums up why I play. Granted, I love raiding and progressing, but I also love the the experience of watching sub-plots unfold before my very eyes as I kill bosses and complete quests. <br />
PvP is fun and all, but all the Halo/Unreal/Counterstrike/Battlefield junkies should quit trying to leverage for PvP changes that more or less change the game into a soulless FPS thinly veiled as an MMO. If you want that sort of thing, Warhammer is around the corner.....</div></div><hr />

I play for PvP only, and wish they would swap some of the dev team over to working on more PvP content. I don't care if they ruin lore, and I wish all the lore nerds would go back to WC3.<br />
<br />
See what I did there? Most of that is truth, a lot players don't care about lore, and enjoy the arena system. Thankfully they are doing more for PvP in the xpac, hopefully it will be enough.</div></div><hr />

If that were so, then there wouldn't have been such a huge backlash towards Metzen's infamous Draenei/Eredar retcon when TBC was on the verge of launch. The fact is the majority of players DO care about the lore in some varying degree or another.</div></div><hr />

And for a lot of people it is a somewhat minor degree.</div></div><hr />
