Battle of Dazar’alor Opens January 22<br />

For ages untold, Dazar’alor has stood at the center of the great and powerful Zandalari empire. Its guards have thwarted numerous attempts on King Rastakhan’s life, and it has endured trials both ancient and new. But as war reaches the shores of Zuldazar, the Alliance embarks on a daring gambit to besiege the golden pyramid and sever the Zandalari’s bond to the Horde.<br />

I'm sorry, but what the FUCK are you thinking Blizzard? Why are you consistently trying to fuck over your player base? I think I am done. There is no point in playing until nearly 2 months from now, and by then I won't give a fuck about this game anymore. My motivation was already extremely low. This is just sad. My favorite game has fallen so low I don't even recognize it anymore. Devs used to care. Now they act like this game is a burden, and couldn't give two shits whether is fails or succeeds.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. January 22nd might as well be February. When they stated January, most expected the first week of January. <br />
2. Allows them to be off? For what? Two fucking months? That's unacceptable. I get two days off. Christmas, and New years. I am taking the weekend after Christmas off. This is the business world. Not fucking high school. <br />
3. The patch that they are giving us are things that should have been in at launch and they're STILL not addressing the major issues this xpac brought.<br />
<br />
There is absolutely no excuse for this level of half assery from a billion dollar company. This is a clear sign that this game is failing, and it spells disaster for the future of this game. I expect sub numbers to dwindle below the million mark now if they haven't already.</div></div><hr />

*Blizzard releases any news*<br />
<br />
OMFG, THAT'S IT, I QUIT. This game is worth playing anymore. The sky is on fire! Things are different or things aren't different enough. <br />
<br />
I get that there are legitimate gripes to be had, but this has been a fairly constant thing for a while now. We get a patch, we get a raid a little later. Its not that big of a freaking deal.<br />
<br />
I do wish they had said SOMETHING about Allied Races, but damn. It'll be ok.</div></div><hr />

<br />
My main issue is the quality of this expansion compared to the last one is so much less even with content gaps. If 8.2.x looks promising I will come back and I will get my Zandalari. Until then Warframe and Guildwars 2 will have my attention as well as my Switch.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think it is comming in January 22 together with the raid, but the LFR will probably have to wait longer for all the LFR wings to unlock. <br />
And knowing Blizzard and Ion, you probably might even have to raid in each faction as well, to unlock them seperately <br />

Well considering it was not mentioned in this overview we are not getting them until 8.1.5 so don't expect that patch to drop until people are bored. Most people don't do actual normal raids, they use LFR so it won't be 22nd for the vast majority regardless.</div></div><hr />

They are still finishing the models of the Zandalari and the Kul Tirans, so they won't come out rushed! I mean, it has been such a short time since their announcement ... /S</div></div><hr />

<br />
It's because blizzard has time tables and they don't plan on throwing any new content outside of what they've already designated. So they time gate us to make us sub longer.</div></div><hr />

April / may might be the Cruciable of Storms, which still is part of patch 8.1 i believe. July might be the release of 8.2 and the raid in september, after classic and warcraft 3 release... i think</div></div><hr />

Well Classic is in there somewhere too don't forget, so they have to plan around that, and if it is out before 8.2 I am probably going to do that.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I think they are planning to release Classic and warcraft both in the summer. The best wow timing to incorporate those two releases might be between patch 8.2 release and Azshara raid, which i think might come out june/july and september respectively. If people are bored of the gated Azshara dailies, thry will just go play warcraft 3 or classic</div></div><hr />

<br />
OMFG, THAT'S IT, I QUIT. This game is worth playing anymore. The sky is on fire! Things are different or things aren't different enough. <br />
<br />
I get that there are legitimate gripes to be had, but this has been a fairly constant thing for a while now. We get a patch, we get a raid a little later. Its not that big of a freaking deal.<br />
<br />
I do wish they had said SOMETHING about Allied Races, but damn. It'll be ok.<br />
<br />
THIS<br />
Thank you. As for the Zandalari and KT humans, they're probably coming in 8.1.5, when the raid comes. just like in 7.3.5 we got the first Allied Races</div></div><hr />

I'm sorry, but what the FUCK are you thinking Blizzard? Why are you consistently trying to fuck over your player base? I think I am done. There is no point in playing until nearly 2 months from now, and by then I won't give a fuck about this game anymore. My motivation was already extremely low. This is just sad. My favorite game has fallen so low I don't even recognize it anymore. Devs used to care. Now they act like this game is a burden, and couldn't give two shits whether is fails or succeeds.<br />

That does not change the fact that the New Blizzard President was and is against Classic from the start . Or the fact that Classic is not going to be as well regarded or popular as many seem to think . If it happens<br />

You're blowing it way out of proportion. <br />
<br />
1. You're assuming it's the same people complaining both times. It's not. There's always going to be one group who complains no matter what, but don't go assuming it's the same people every time.<br />
<br />
2. In Legion 99% of people were happy with the rate of content coming out. I distinctly recall overwhelming praise for Blizzard's rate of content, so where are you getting the impression there was unrest?<br />
<br />
3. In Legion there were around 7 weeks in between launch of EN and ToV. There were a further 9 weeks between launch of EN and Nighthold -- that's 16 weeks in total. Currently in BfA, Uldir has been out for 14 weeks, and by the time Siege of Dazar'alor comes out, Uldir will have been the only raid for 20 weeks. So basically by the time Siege comes out, Legion would have done so FOUR weeks sooner AND thrown an extra raid in the meantime to keep us entertained. Warfronts take a lot of development time, as do Islands. Truth be told though, your typical MMOC reader is more likely to be interested in raids, not IEs or WFs.<br />
<br />
Also your language and attitude is atrocious and juvenile. Enjoy your infraction. Get help with that attitude of yours.</div></div><hr />

It would help if any of the content coming out was actually good instead of band aid fixes and shit filler, because the low/no effort comments certainly hold weight. Tides of Vengeance does nothing significant to adress player grievances with this expansion and it will not have a large impact on subscriber numbers.</div></div><hr />

Yup, this patch is releasing later because people complained that 7.1 came too soon, meh, no surprises from the community here, but I won't say you are being polite, you are killing whatever argument you want to have talking like this.<br />

<br />
While I agree with you, what he said has some truth in it, he should have said so in a more polite manner but I don't expect people to be polite in the internet.<br />
<br />
The only mistake I see in the releasing times is that Siege of Dazar should have come at the same time that nighthold, 16 weeks, since Crucible is the same as TOV and we will have that afer Siege.<br />
<br />
This means that we will have 1 more raid between Siege and the one in 8.2 giving them time to make, or at least try to make a great patch. Remember that after nighthold we waited a lot of time for ToS.<br />
<br />
Or at least I want to see it this way. I agree that the second raid is coming late tho, I have a casual guild and we push HC, we don't have 20 people so mythic raididing is out of the question, we need a new raid and this one is coming out late so that will hurt the guild quite a lot.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1) if Jan 22nd might as well be feb... then it would be feb not Jan... There is an entire week of Jan left on the 22nd<br />
2) yes allows them to be off, their support staff and other staffs will prob be in min manning till the 1st or 2nd week of Jan, its not that uncommon in work spaces to expect more people to be off and rarely be a full staffing during the holidays. Not the entire company off for 2 months lol. Also raid teams can relax and enjoy a break if they want. <br />
3) i'm not happy with BFA, nor was I with Legion either but i just play less, 3-4 hours a week vs 3-4horus a day i during WoD and earlier. <br />
<br />
and to add i never expected the raid to be launched in Dec, i'm actually surprised they didn't push the patch till Jan.</div></div><hr />

In Legion, Emerald Nightmare raid was released on September 20 2016.. The Nighthold was released January 18 2017 so nearly four months in Emerald Nightmare..<br />
<br />
In BfA, Uldir raid was released on September 4 2018, Battle of Dazar’alor will be open on January 22 2019 so just a bit over four months in Uldir..<br />
<br />
All can say is impatient are you if you think that four months is too long..<br />

<br />
They want to get raiders to resub for that extra month.<br />
<br />
Thing is that the time between Uldir and Battle of Dazar’alor are not really that much more than the time between Emerald Nightmare and The Nighthold in Legion..<br />

I raid with my guild and despite raiding twice a week it always feels like Blizzard is rushing us to burn through the content before they just hand out the raid loot to anyone who walks through the door. It often feels like there really isn't much of a point to raiding anymore, just do pet battles for 3-4 months and Blizzard will just hand you raid level epics to catch you up.<br />

I've been unsubbed for 2 months and the only temping thing is for me to resub and level up alts with the XP nerf for heritage armor and level my dwarf/blood elf to 120 for theirs. I used to be a hardcore player but wow devs in 2018 have turned me into a dollhouse transmog collector... feelsbadman.</div></div><hr />

You managed to copy and paste EXACTLY what is posted on the MMOC site. lol Unless there is anything that isn:t listed there, why would you make a thread on this?<br />
<br />
Are you asking why I posted a blue post on the front page, as news, just like we do for every other relevant blue post?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">ProfessorTjc</div><div class="date">2018-12-08, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Seriously Blizzard? You will not release the raid in December? What do you expect? That I spend my holidays with my family or something?! Shame on you!<br />
<br />
That raid has only been out for 3 months... calm down. Xpac was release August 14th and Uldir didn't come until September 4th.</div></div><hr />

Dude, that was sarcasm. Like the average answer of folks around here, that can't be a little patience, and want to consume all the content in the moment... even the raid in holidays. Just imagine the mythic race in chrismas... a total shitshow. :rolleyes:</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Surreality</div><div class="date">2018-12-09, 02:41 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I feel like Activision is purposefully sabotaging the value of World of Warcraft. They've turned it into a virtual dollhouse with some half-assed harder content for the fraction of a fraction of the population that still even bother with raids. It's pretty much like any other free to play game with no respectability, except it has a subscription charge, making it worse than any free to play game. I'm certainly not going to pay 15 dollars a month or even spend the minimal amount of time required to farm the little bit of gold needed for tokens so I can go on &quot;transmog and mount runs&quot;. I'm definitely not paying 15 dollars a month for &quot;Classic&quot;, a game I already spent 15 dollars a month on over a decade ago to play.</div></div><hr />

<br />
What a surprise. Almost as if people make the &quot;good/bad/good&quot;-idiocy a self-fulfilling thing.</div></div><hr />
