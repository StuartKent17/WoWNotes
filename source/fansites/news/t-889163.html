Chat With Your Guild Using the Mobile Armory<br />
The remote guild chat is now available on all realms from the official site.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
The remote guild chat is part of the &quot;World of Warcraft Remote&quot; service and costs $2,99 / month (also includes the remote Auction House) <br />
The service works on all realms and a free preview is available for players of the Fizzcrank and Lightbringer realms.<br />
Not available on Android yet. <br />
<br />
<br />
A new feature has just been added to the World of Warcraft Mobile Armory app: remote Guild Chat! As part of the latest update for the free Mobile Armory app for the iPhone and iPod touch, the new Guild Chat feature lets you stay in touch with your guildmates wherever you go:<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Read and contribute to your guildâ€™s in-game chat channel in real time<br />
<br />
<br />
Participate in one-on-one conversations with members of your guild<br />
<br />
<br />
View the members of your guild who are currently online<br />
<br />
<br />
For a limited time, players can use the Guild Chat feature without a subscription to World of Warcraft Remote. During this time, we'll be rolling out the Guild Chat feature to select realms, with more realms being added in the future -- check out the list below to see if the feature is currently available on your realm. After the free preview period ends, players will need to have a subscription to World of Warcraft Remote in order to continue using the feature. We'll announce the end of the free preview period, along with the availability of the feature on Android devices, in the near future -- keep an eye on the official World of Warcraft website for further details.<br />

BB isn't really the final say, how can he tell really? sure the ptrs still up and it doesn't say extended maintenance but there was a restart today and its blizz, who says they won't just take down ptr last min and have it back up with 4.2 hours later</div></div><hr />

no, the blue post says only those 2 realms are eligible for a FREE PREVIEW. which means other realms need to BUY it to use it.</div></div><hr />

Your base monthly fee allows you to RENT your characters, items you have on them and access WoW servers through game client.<br />
<br />
All these mobile apps are totally unecessary to play the game. They are just luxury features - therefore the minor extra fee.</div></div><hr />

Portal is one of the most fun and unique games I have played in a long time, and some of the puzzles I've seen in Portal 2 so far look brain-meltingly awesome.<br />

The only 2 days that are a possibility are tomorrow and next week. They add some stuff for Children's Week in Patch 4.1 and that starts 1st May 2011. Blizzard have never deployed a new patch in the middle of a holiday and next week is the middle of Noblegarden and the week after is the middle of Children's Week but I guess there is always a first time for anything.</div></div><hr />

Mine is telling me &quot;The free preview of Remote Guild Chat is not yet enabled for this realm&quot; even though I already paid for the service. :|<br />
<br />
Edit: Just read, and it DOES seem that the Guild Chat feature is only available on those two realms. Maybe you should remove the &quot;available on all realms&quot; from the front page and try to avoid as many pissed off people as possible.</div></div><hr />

So you can imagine my joy when i hear its released and enabled on my realm, lightbringer. I happily subscribe, download the releveant app and guess what! Its not working. I've re installed the app twice, double checked that i paid, logged in and out about four times and nothing. Why say its ready when its not :P <br />

1. Apple software and Android software are completely different <br />
2. There some features you can do on the Iphone that aren't possible on the Android<br />
<br />
Just cause something is popular doesn't make it easy to code for. (off topic but PS2 was super popular, but a pain to code for. PSP sold a ton of systems everyone made games for the Nintendo DS cause it was easy to port stuff to it.)</div></div><hr />

<br />
I agree that beeing popular does not make it easy to code, BUT a company as big as Blizz should have some guy in the team that is able to programm for Andriod aswell. I really am surprised because its a business for them, since they charge 3 bucks a month. So there should be a motivation to develop for the popular but hard to work on platform aswell.<br />
<br />
An honest question (really): What relevant things (for the mobile armory that is) are possible on the Iphone software wise that are not possible on Andriod based systems? I am not that much into mobile programming, so this might be a noob question :)</div></div><hr />

The front page should be fixed to state that it doesn't appear to be working outside of the two stated realms, irrespective of whether you have paid for the remote or not.<br />

<br />
Why should it be Free? Give me one good reason? It's not a standard feature in MMO's nor is it even Needed. WoW has been fine for years before this feature so why does it need to be free? People like me have a social life so I don't care for this mobile feature I don't need it. But I understand why they charge for it. And thats because it's an Extra feature you don't actually have to get. Its an OPTION.<br />

<br />
My team does both Android and iOS development.<br />
Although Android is simple to code against, there are so many differences in capabilities on the devices that it is a pain to support them all. The difference in ability is vast between say, an Evo and the many, many Android phones which are cheap Asian knock offs who don't pay for software anyways. (Where did you think all that market share increase was coming from?). Blizzard would be swapping the &quot;Why don't you support Android?&quot; QQ for &quot;Why doesn't your Armory app work on my Hello Kitty phone?&quot; QQ.<br />
<br />
Blizzard already has voiced concerns in the past about opening chat to remote clients (Remote Scripts, Go!), so it's not surprising that they are being cautious here. Search for &quot;Netflix on Android&quot; if you want some more info.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You don't? Our accounts are very very secure from Blizzards side, no account have ever been hacked that way.<br />
What the authenticator do, it's protecting your account from your side, it's a safetynet if you get keylogged or have your password compromised in other ways.<br />
<br />
You're paying to protect your account from yourself in a manner of speaking.</div></div><hr />

Seems to only demote you if you are logged on to the same character in the remote app and in game at the same time.

It's okay to cry like a girl with every announcement that comes from Blizz HQ, but don't criticise something else.....<br />
<br />
I love the criticism from people who's main claim to fame is that they can spell their own name right. For the really good ones it is the fact that they can get their pee into the bowl. I'm sorry you are so angry about the fact that you can't win at portal. Try using your brain, it really is there for a reason.</div></div><hr />
