Nope. No Felblight on the vendor.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Yes. But its important to remember that for an organized raid personal loot has a few disadvantages, which may make the choice not as straight forward. You cannot control who gets loot, and you cannot trade it of course. Which means that with bad luck, you could get dupes and someone else might not get anything, or you might get an item which is barely an upgrade for you, but BiS for someone else.<br />
<br />
In the grand scheme of things, for a raiding guild, personal loot will probably not be an actual option, but for all these PuGs, Personal Loot might be a very good alternative now.</div></div><hr />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mmoc9aac36c166</div><div class="date">2015-06-22, 01:11 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I can see nothing new &quot;content&quot; in WoD/WoW since new character models and the garrisons, raid system. This patch brings nothing but additions to already existing content:<br />
- Factions/reputations check<br />
- Raid check<br />
- Battle pets check<br />
- World boss check<br />
- PvP check<br />
- Professions check<br />
- Heirlooms check<br />
- Mounts check<br />
- Toys check<br />
- Legendary item check<br />
- Dungeons check (you can say timewalking/mythic is something new, but it really isn't. Just old content used up again to run it for the 438th time.)<br />
etc.<br />
See? Nothing new in the game, just 1 more upgrade/addition of the already existing content. This patch is an illusion, it won't bring back ppl to the game. It's only worth the story to play for, but in a few weeks it will be over again.<br />
<br />
I would be glad to see a completely overhauled combat system with more &quot;active mitigation&quot;, but way less spells/abilities. An upgraded Azeroth both in graphics and activities in each zone with daily interest. However not activities like timeless isle, rather than isle of thunder with more &quot;games&quot; like some parts of &quot;The Stormbreaker&quot; achievement required (jumping on pads, ropes, solve more complex puzzles, arcade games etc.). See? Content w/o the requirement of raiding and pvp, because I think WoW shouldn't be about raiding and pvp mostly. If someone says pve, then the first thing comes to your mind is raiding. This is wrong.<br />
<br />
Also I feel lvl 100 is too much, 700 skillpoints in professions is too much, xp required for each lvl is too much. Player leveling could be also like the follower/battle pet leveling. Reach a certain level and gain access to the &quot;uncommon&quot;, &quot;rare&quot;, &quot;epic&quot; sub-levels of a level. This could reduce the current max. level to ~30. This requires a complete overhauling of item requirements, dungeon difficulties, quests/leveling content, but it would be real content if you connect it to the new activities mentioned above.<br />
<br />
There are so many opportunities to make this game live again and these doesn't require the change of lore which is behind the game.</div></div><hr />

I think the inclusion of a single daily quest is what they mean. Semantics, for sure, but technically that would be &quot;less&quot; grindy.</div></div><hr />

I thought you were being sarcastic until I kept reading.<br />
<br />
You might as well say &quot;content - check&quot;. No one (except you, maybe) expects an entire combat overhaul or graphics engine overhaul from a patch. That is usually from expansion releases.<br />
<br />
Then you complain about leveling to 100 taking too long, even though it's incredibly short. 1-60 is over in a blink if you run dungeons (which is far more effective than questing, negating most zones in kalimdor and EK), and professions are super easy to level with the new WoD system.</div></div><hr />

I feel sorry for the artists that made the new warlock demon pets, they are all for the supremacy talent and most specs show better numbers on sacrificing them, that and blizzard decided forcing warlocks into a hard to play class like demonology was a bad call, so it would be better to nerf demonology and affliction and force us into destruction :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
In the end this whole expansion has kinda left me wondering if blizzard really know what they are doing with warlocks and where they are headed in terms of class design, really hope they get their acts together.</div></div><hr />

Flying will be part of a minipatch 6.2.x shortly after 6.2.<br />

Nah, sadly it does..the only truly new thing is the raid, the dungeons are just reused stuff and Tanaan...more mindnumbing mobfarm...I mean Northern Kalimdor have a darker night now...the rest of the world?

You do realize that its just as possible that the greater number of complaints opposed to compliments aimed at wow is a reflection of the general attitude towards the game? The more people who complain on forums, the larger the number of people not voicing themselves who feel bad about the games current state. Hell, its common in business to count one person who is speaking up, as multiple people. Why is it only in MMO and video games where people complaining are never seen as representing a population? There are certainly more people complaining about wow than there ever have been ever, and that says something. Hell, most of the people on my friends list would never post on forums, but the vast majority of my realID, who did play during MoP, have quit for WoD out of dissatisfaction.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1 - Haven't been around in a while to know the length of time servers are down for a patch like this. Will this be a 4-6 hr window of downtime? more, less?<br />
<br />
2 - I'm guessing this has been addressed somewhere before, but I was unable to find the answer. For the initial raids, like Highmaul which drop 640 in lfr, will there still be the need to do those? With the 2nd WoD pvp season and the ilvl of those items, there wouldn't be much need to do the 'older' dungeons.<br />
<br />
Thanks.</div></div><hr />

You just use the first upgrade item repeatedly for Stages 2-4 now. Each time you use it, upgraded one stage.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Um, that's what a content patch does. 6.2 isn't a new expansion.<br />
<br />
In short: the game gets like 20% new content with each expansions and 80% additions to already existing content. The same goes to expansions and patches (20%-80%), which is wrong, I think.<br />
<br />
<br />
I thought you were being sarcastic until I kept reading.<br />
<br />
You might as well say &quot;content - check&quot;. No one (except you, maybe) expects an entire combat overhaul or graphics engine overhaul from a patch. That is usually from expansion releases.<br />
<br />
Then you complain about leveling to 100 taking too long, even though it's incredibly short. 1-60 is over in a blink if you run dungeons (which is far more effective than questing, negating most zones in kalimdor and EK), and professions are super easy to level with the new WoD system.<br />
<br />
I just say the numbers are too high, ridiculously high like they were before WoD dmg changes. These &quot;point&quot; systems also need change. <br />
I don't doubt it's super easy and I didn't say anything about the difficulty.</div></div><hr />

I agree with you dude. It's so annoying, and these people that bash literally everything released in game are the same ones that go, &quot;but we care about WoW that's why we're mad! we dont want it to fail!&quot; Also notice it's always &quot;we&quot; like they're one collective mind or spokesperson for everyone that's not currently subbed. Can't think or form an opinion of their own, just latch on to the most popular point of view. It's one thing to be unsatisfied and offer constructive feedback on what you'd like to see improved and why (and some have), especially if you enjoy the game but it's something completely different to spread around #FireHazzicostas, go on change.org to demand flying of all things, add nothing of substance and just have a massive temper tantrum about any and everything. I asked someone the other day that was saying Blizzard is lazy (etc, etc), what have they enjoyed so far in WoD. They said, &quot;I don't know really I've been unsubbed since Cataclysm and don't plan on coming back&quot;. What the... *Flips table*</div></div><hr />

I dont think you want to be agreeing with the guy that says Blizzard doesn't care if people are subbed or not. <br />
<br />
Also, there are extremes on both sides, just like with most opposing groups of people. Just because you had a single experience with a person who had nothing to offer doesn't mean there aren't plenty of good reasons why people are upset about the state of WoD or WoW in general. Just like there are people with legit arguments for why they still play as opposed to people who think Blizzard is absolutely incapable of doing any wrong.</div></div><hr />

Whats far worse is those people who galavante around as if there is nothing wrong despite each new bit of information hammering it in again and again that there is something wrong with the game.<br />
<br />
There are lots of people complaining about WoW, more than ever by far. Yet there are those who run around going on about how nothing is wrong, or how things are over stated. When no, they are wrong, and the issues aren't over stated. People provide mountains of evidence pointing towards the game going downhill and all the opposition can bring up is &quot;Nope, you're wrong.&quot;</div></div><hr />

Not sure that's what he said but perceptions vary on the internet. What I took away from &quot;like if blizzard gives a fuck if you come back of not jeez...&quot; is that he was referring to all of the bellyaching and surly folks. The WoW community could do with less trolls.<br />
<br />
It wasn't a single experience either, was merely the most recent comment I've seen among many that has absolutely no value. As I mentioned, if there's valid reasons as to why someone isn't satisfied then by all means express yourself but letting the complaint stop short as just a complaint and then follow it up with ignorance and foolishness does nothing to add to the longevity of a game.</div></div><hr />

Didn't think Blizzard would put the garrison gold nerf in at the last minute. Thought it'd be a 6.2.x change. Sneaky sneaky. Guess they were hoping no one would notice. Makes me wonder if missions for 100g and up got the nerf bat or if the bar's a bit higher.</div></div><hr />

They waited longer than that actually. This is the first content patch since 5.4 when SoO was implemented. 6.0 isn't a content patch since we pay for that with the expansion price. That was funnily enough the shittiest one and cost the most.<br />

<br />
The big crates thing is out of nowhere though. Wouldn't it make more sense to make level 100 missions the only source? They tend to take longer than level 95-99 missions, and Blizzard are meant to be trying to reduce the 'need' to visit the Garrison multiple times in a play session because of the shorter missions. If anything this would make people looking for upgrade tokens and transmog gear do so much more often.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Eh, the idea is they don't want people with many alts to get X times the amount of gold missions a person with only one character can get.<br />
<br />
Nerfing the gold reward from missions doesn't help that issue; it punishes players with few alts to close a loop hole those with many alts were able to use.<br />
<br />
This system serves the idea better, even though I still think it blows and think if a person wants to spend most of their time managing gold income on alts instead of pursuing other activities they should be allowed to. <br />
<br />
I just hope they don't dress it up as 'alleviating the obligation to log into multiple characters every day' because I didn't mind doing that, and will continue to do so regardless of the nerf.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">JemiS</div><div class="date">2015-06-23, 07:06 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Right. Which is my problem with this. <br />
<br />
Never in WoW's past have they had a problem with X alts getting X times the rewards for X times the effort. <br />
<br />
Now people putting in less effort get (proportionally) more rewards. <br />
<br />
My 9th alt has the same costs as my 2nd alt. Repair costs for raid wipes don't go down, gem and enchant costs don't go down- heck, even garrison costs don't decrease. <br />
<br />
But now, my 9th alt will get less gold than my 2nd alt. <br />
<br />
What's next, nerfing the gold drops from raids on an account wide level? Preventing multiple crafting CDs at the account wide level so people don't stack, say, inscription for profit?<br />
<br />
Getting linear rewards from multiple alts has always been there, from multiple scribes at the start of MoP for multiple daily CDs to multiple Alchemists for daily transmutes. <br />
<br />
If Blizzard want's to nerf benefits for multiple alts, they also need to nerf the costs of multiple alts, else playing alts is more costly than playing a main, and that' just not fair.</div></div><hr />

I feel sorry for the artists that made the new warlock demon pets, they are all for the supremacy talent and most specs show better numbers on sacrificing them, that and blizzard decided forcing warlocks into a hard to play class like demonology was a bad call, so it would be better to nerf demonology and affliction and force us into destruction :rolleyes:<br />
<br />
In the end this whole expansion has kinda left me wondering if blizzard really know what they are doing with warlocks and where they are headed in terms of class design, really hope they get their acts together.<br />
<br />
They updated the models because of the heavy Legion involvement. Warlocks just so happen to get new pets since the art is already there.</div></div><hr />

Its not valid and your assessment isnt accurate. This patch has as much or more content than any of the MoP, cata, and LK patches. Full size zone, 3 factions, full size raid, profession growth and numerous stylistic additions. A couple new five mans would have been iving, but the zone depth and shipyards are the offset for casual PVE'rs. YMMV on the enjoyment of each thing, but it is not a quantity issue.

Eeeer can you elaborate please? Sure there is content in there,but not enough to keep people busy for one year (AT LEAST)<br />
The raid is of course something nice.But lets take a look outside of raids :<br />
1) No new questlines .By the end of the summer you will complete the garrison campaign and be exalted with all new factions.No more content on this section for like 9 monhts or even more.<br />
2)I dont play pvp,but from what I see there is nothing new there.<br />
3)Dungeon timewalking may be dressed as new content,but its basically old content,you can actually properly play those dungeons while leveling.Sure nostalgic players will have fun for a couple of runs,but after that its boring again. THe only reason people might bother is the free seal on the weekend event.<br />
4)Shipyard is just another part of garrisonville.Doesnt count as content,your ships will do the job for you.<br />
<br />
So to summarize : after you farm the new reputation,experence timewalking a bit and have your navy ready, what is there to do outside of HFC?Nothing to keep you interested in the game for a year thats for sure.</div></div><hr />

The raid is of course something nice.But lets take a look outside of raids :<br />

Where did 9 months or more come from? Likely to be a 6.3 patch slightly before or after holidays. Six months is long for any patch's content, but its certainly not the end of the world. Players with tons of free time will bored after 2-3, but there are plenty of altoholics and casuals who will use most, if not all, of that time and still have things to finish or explore.</div></div><hr />
