Earthfury Epaulets (T1 Shaman) in Molten Core<br />
Unfortunately you will have to wait for the fix to the Baron's loot table to get a pair of those Earthfury Epaulets. The good news is the Eye of Sulfuras is still on Ragnaros' loot table, so it is possible to receive this item. <br />
<br />
[...] It'll get fixed in a future patch. Unfortunately I can't really say when =(. The fix should be in the patch notes and if it isn't, I'll update this thread. Sorry for the inconvenience. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25134713303/earthfury-epaulets-unobtainable/))<br />

Psychic Horror / Anti Magic Shield<br />
We looked into this is and it is intended. Psychic Horror was changed so that the disarm effect still occurs regardless of whether the target is immune to the fear portion. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026406031/psychic-horror-disarms-in-ams/))<br />
<br />
http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/icons/ipaladins.gif Paladin (Forums (http://www.mmo-champion.com/class-paladin/) / Talent Calculator (http://talent.mmo-champion.com/?paladin))<br />
Retribution in Cataclysm (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/t/25026405663/will-divine-storm-remain-the-51-point-talent/))<br />
There are a few basic way classes choose what attack to use next. Some classes are limited by resources. If a rogue has 60 energy, she can choose to spend it on attack A or attack B. If attack A hits harder and attack B doesn't have situational utility, then she'll use A every time.<br />
<br />
A warlock generally isn't limited by mana within short time scales. A lock's decisions are more rotational. You want to cast A before you cast B. It's not that B is bad, just that it becomes more powerful if you do A first. For example, there is little point in casting your first Corruption seconds before the target is about to die.<br />
<br />
Paladins have a third model, one more based on prioritization. You aren't generally limited by mana, and you don't generally need to do things in a certain order for the mechanics to work, but you do have attacks that you'd rather use when they are available (generally because they hit harder). The decision point comes in because you have a lot of cooldowns, so you can't just spam your hardest hitting attack over and over again. When your Judgements and Hammer and Crusader Strike are on cooldown, then your choice is probably Divine Storm. (Depending on your gear, DS might even trump CS.) If Divine Storm's damage went down, then you might prioritize Consecration or Exorcism higher, but you can't spam those either, so then you're back to Divine Storm or autoattack. That was my point.<br />
<br />
There are things we can do as well to make Divine Storm better at single targets without making it overpowered against groups of targets. Off the top of my head, there are mechanics like the meteor where the damage is divided among the targets. What we are trying to chill out on the warrior, paladin and DK particularly is the &quot;free AE&quot; component. When your AE attacks are balanced against single targets (in the absence of some mechanic like I was suggesting above) then you just get free damage when you can AE as well. This means those classes leap dramatically ahead on meters whenever they are in a situation where they can &quot;cleave.&quot; It also means they aren't doing anything very differently when faced with groups of mobs over single targets. By contrast the mage might switch to Blizzard or Living Bomb and the rogue has to start using Fan of Knives.<br />
<br />
One of the ways we can support more individual abilities on classes is by making them situational. If you use all of your attacks no matter what the situation, then your gameplay tends to get very formulaic and eventually boring. It is also likely to get really complicated if your whole action bar is part of your standard rotation. A better design, we think, is that some abilities get used in AE situations and some get used in single-target situations. There can be overlap, but we'd at least like players to assess the upcoming battle and make some decisions about how to approach it before just going into a tunnel vision button-hitting mode. <br />
<br />
Solution: Make CS baseline, put a 1 point 10% dmg to CS buff in its place in the talent tree to replace it.<br />
That is not an announced change. I can understand the frustration of being in a gray area at the moment where you know some information that we have released but much of the details are still under NDA. Unfortunately, if you focus on little tidbits that someone leaked or speculated, then you aren't going to get the full story. In cases like this we had to put something in the talent tree as temporary filler when we pulled CS. Many of the talent trees have talents that say NYI or just plain don't do anything. That's just where we are in the alpha process. If we push data at a stage when someone can't even talent down a tree then the spec becomes unplayable. As such, we have to make talent tree changes in large chunks at once. <br />
<br />
GC - &quot;We are nerfing Divine Storm against single targets because we don't want AoE abilities to be used against single targets, but we fully expect Divine Storm to continue to be used against single targets.&quot;<br />
More accurate to say that we don't want single target abilities to get free bonus damage when in groups. That's not balance-able. For the warrior the solution is to make Whirlwind not cost-effective against single-targets. For the DK, it's about getting Pestilence back towards a utility role (getting diseases up on groups) and not a massive AE attack. For the paladin, we still want them to use Divine Storm (and you can't cost-effect a Ret paladin anyway) so the solution will have to be something different. <br />
<br />
How about something like having Crusader Strike apply some kind of debuff to the target . Then have Divine Storm hit anyone with that debuff harder. I think that would get its damage up on single targets but keep it lower on groups.<br />
Yep, both this and the tie-in to Judgements are good ideas. We also like the T102P bonus. <br />

<br />
and the orc fanart looked badass.<br />

As a shadow priest I would love to have a whole action bar maybe not the standard rotation but having more dots and maybe a holy form making us do more damage against undead units and demonic<br />
while shadow form does more damage to any other kind. <br />
and if we would have a dot system where we have 3-5 dots and 2-3 other spells being used in a way that means you should deploy them when its 20% left of the buff so it does more damage <br />
a good example would be. having a curse of agony spell doing more damage in the end and less in the start and much more in the end. Then have another spell increasing damage done by spell a by 75% for the next 5-10 secs and also deal xxxx amount of shadow damage.<br />
I guess it's only me wanting to have it this way.</div></div><hr />

Heroic Ruby Sanctum Testing Schedule 26/05/2010 09:27:14 CEST<br />
<br />
Testing so far on the Ruby Sanctum has gone well. For the next phase of the testing, we're going to allow raids to switch difficulty to Heroic.<br />
<br />
Heroic mode testing will only be available for a limited time, but we hope to allow Normal mode testing for a longer period.<br />
<br />
US Testing Schedule:<br />
Thursday, May 27 at 19:00 EDT.<br />
<br />
EU Testing Schedule:<br />
Friday, May 28 starting at 19:30 CEST.<br />

Yeah, it could really be Brox. The Orc is definetly old, has a lot of scars und he fights against the Burning Legion!<br />

We're missing this...Cataclysm (2012) - The world gets splitted apart to two gigantic continents. New species are to be found. the Elders and survivors of the Human beings being now named Highbornes, including some Failborned children with Longer ears and different skin colours. We're considered the survivors of the Millennia, and now we've aged 10.000Years at some point.<br />
<br />
Sooner or later, we'll discover a Portal in the mountains, and a man named Jack Holsen (then named Medivh) Will be there, opening this Portal, and summon green skins. Us, as current survivors don't have any Machine guns or type of Rapid firing items, so we move to sticks and stone. There on we develop and create our new Clans, and bam, here comes Azeroth into the Picture, and all that has happened now, will happend in the future. Hurr durr durr....<br />

The fan-art is cool, too, especially the orc and alternate universe Arthas. I like alternate universes.<br />
Necrofrost? No, the blue is common for paladins:<br />

It also appears as an effect on the warrior's and paladin's PvP helmet (based on the above picture).<br />
<br />
I guess you've got a point, and I do know it's a fairly common paladin color as well. It just seemed like &quot;that&quot; kind of blue. I guess the runes on Light's Vengeance (which I don't remember from wc3 or the description of the hammer in RoLK) and the 'ghostly' energy it radiated in blue from the big rune sort of helped. Just focusing on the eyes, now that you say it, they don't look like necrofrost blue. I still wonder about Light's Vengeance, though.</div></div><hr />

impossible. kil jaeden would never have let nerzhul get away, and there was absolutely nothing nerzhul could have done to prevent capture as soon as he stepped through the portal like a coward into the twisting nether.<br />
<br />
the only way the scourge could have been prevented is if turalyon managed to break through and kill nerzhul first, but that was impossible too since they were short on troops and supplies.</div></div><hr />

Actually stargate is based on the belief that human kind had influence from aliens, like battlestar galactica.Its all based on a theroy that a german scientist had in the 1960s/70s.<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Infernix</div><div class="date">2010-05-27, 08:22 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">That Arthas picture makes you think. What if the plague had never hit? There would be no forsaken. What if Arthas didn't seek out Frostmourne, who would be the current Lich King? Stratholme would still be a functioning city. Would Stormwind still exist? So many possible roads from just this picture. Pretty amazing.<br />

<br />
Bloodied, beaten but unbroken, Arthas and Muradin stare at the blade encased in ice, Arthas nearly on top of the cursed thing, Muradin unable to do anything but stare in horror. &quot;Now, I call out to the spirits of this place, I will give anythi-&quot; Interrupted, tackled by a sudden bolt of iron and muscle and righteous fury.<br />
<br />
&quot;I'll not let you do this, lad! If a price must be paid, if a spirit must be seared,let it be mine!&quot; Stunned, dazed, the flailing and stuttering Prince could only watch in rage and indignation as the dwarf turned and shattered the ice. And then, he knew no more.<br />
<br />
When he awoke, both blade and his friend were gone. Long days of hiking, utterly demoralized and bewildered, the Prince found his way down to the shoreline to most of his men waiting for him with news of Muradin's departure days before. Enraged, the Prince ordered his men to sail for home.<br />
<br />
By the time he got there, news had arrived in Lordaeron of Ironforge's fall. Infested from within, Magni dead, and the newly reviled Deathknight Muradin on the throne. The news left Arthas a shaken man, cloistered away for days while King Teranis summoned most of their forces to fortify the bridge leading to the Wetlands, reinforcing the human forces in the Arathi Highlands. <br />
<br />
Meanwhile, Ironforge and the dwarven lands became an infested land, and then came the horrifying news of Stormwind's fall and burning. News came of a constructed tunnel, a burrowing of Scourge forces from Ironforge that had burst into the heart of Elwynn Forest and Stormwind city. The news broke Arthas' melancholy and he emerged, renewed, resolved and full of Retribution.<br />
<br />
The battle for against Muradin and his forces are a part of history now. How he had captured and turned Jaina into one of the Undead to serve him, and how she had led a rebellion against the mad Deathknight and reclaimed Stormwind for her Forgotten undead. Bitter with hatred, self-loathing for her actions while enthralled, she reviles her once-love Arthas for his madness that led to her desecration and the destruction of her home. Some whisper it was this hatred that led her to join the Horde and take her Forgotten with her.<br />
<br />
Today, Arthas rules the last remnants of human power in the Eastern Kingdoms, the shining beackon of Lordaeron, partnered with his friends Varian Wrynn, exiled king of Stormwind, and King Kaelthas Sunstrider, they work ceaselessly to somehow retake the festering pit of Undeath that is Ironforge and Gnomeregan. The few remaining dwarven kind that are not undead have taken up residence in the Hinterlands with the Wildhammer Clan or the Dark Irons, but all strive endlessly to reclaim their home, while deep in Northrend, the hated and feared Lich King sits on his throne, one forged from misguided love for his friend....</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed.<br />
<br />
And the people constantly accusing Blizzard of ripping off from other sources which took their stuff from ancient mythology is just getting old and tiresome. I swear, if Blizzard puts a Zeus-like character in the game, there will be many retards here who will say that Blizz ripped off from God of War.</div></div><hr />

you are awesome x 9000.<br />

but one thing, it takes maximum 30 minutes or less to walk from frostmourne cavern down to the shore. arthas must be walking with some sick snare effect on him if it takes him days.<br />
<br />
i shudder to think of the combined power of light arthas and varian.</div></div><hr />
