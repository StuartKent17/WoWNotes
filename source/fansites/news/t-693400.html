A few hours ago, all the players involved in the Lich King 25 world first kill of Ensidia (http://www.ensidia.com) had their account suspended for 72 hours, Gamemasters also removed the achievements and loot acquired during yesterday's raid. <br />
<br />
Date of Violation: 03/02/2010<br />
Type of violation: Exploitation – Abuse of in-game mechanics or glitches with intent to exploit or cheat in World of Warcraft.<br />
Details: Use of Saronite Bombs to bypass The Lich King fight mechanics Consequences for Account: Account suspended for 72 hours, all items and achievements gained removed<br />
<br />
This isn't my place to discuss whether the ban is rightful or not, however Ensidia was nice enough to provide me with more information. <br />
<br />
First, it seems that the bug was caused by a single rogue (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Tarren%20Mill&amp;n=Naihiko) (always blame it on the rogues!) who used Saronite Bombs (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41119/saronite-bomb/) throughout the fight. Apparently the siege damage caused by the bombs bugged the encounter's mechanics and respawned the platform destroyed by the Lich King during the encounter. <br />
<br />
It results in the fight being fairly easier because you end up with more room to move and more importantly, you do not have to care about Valkyrs taking away your raid members anymore. (They will just land on the rebuilt platform when they fall down) <br />
<br />
The problem with the Saronite Bombs (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41119/saronite-bomb/) is simple, a lot of rogues have been using them for the past months (and it's been documented on ElitistJerks for quite some time now) and a lot of high-end rogues who like to maximize their DPS just consider it part of their normal DPS rotation. <br />
<br />
Below are the WoL reports for all the boss fights in yesterday's raid.<br />

Lich King<br />
(Naihiko)<br />
<br />
These logs clearly show that Naihiko (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Tarren%20Mill&amp;n=Naihiko) uses Saronite Bombs all the time, and we're talking about a raid who never saw the Lich King and couldn't really know that it would bug the encounter. Additionally, I took the time to screenshot Naihiko (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Tarren%20Mill&amp;n=Naihiko)'s damage report during his last 5 raids. (I realize that two raids are in the same week, this is only because he used his alt Naihika (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Tarren%20Mill&amp;n=Naihika))<br />

<br />
Of course, all these screenshots are based on text logs and I do realize that they can be modified easily (but it does look like a lot of work to include so many entries). The only &quot;wrong&quot; thing Ensidia did is to keep going and kill the boss with the bug because they had no way to identify the source of the problem. Even going through raw combat logs (http://paste.wowace.com/zfhorvdl57nw820b/) wouldn't help because it looks like they only show Saronite Bomb damaging NPCs.<br />
<br />
I also want to make it clear that I'm not trying to defend or attack anyone here, I just thought it could be a good thing to bring some more information to the discussion. Hopefully, it will start a more interesting and mature discussion about the issue, you totally have the right to think that Ensidia should be banned, just don't be aggressive about it in comments. (or in my mail (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/january/love.jpg))<br />
<br />
This is only what Ensidia gave me; I can't prove this is the complete information, nor this hasn't been tempered. And knowing Blizzard, they won't disclose any more information they may have on their side. So I can only relate Ensidia's side of the story.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Why was the rogue planting saronite bombs at the edge of the platform, where he could be instantly killed by any valkyr, and where the Lich King and the adds are never tanked? What was the rogue DPSing? Does Ensidia tank the Lich King and the adds at the edge of the platform, where any raid member can be carried away and instantly killed?<br />

Because you have to go away from the middle of the room to kill adds. You stand on the parts of the platform that get destroyed fighting adds for a lot of time.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
That proves they tanked Lich King and the adds at the edge of the platform because they knew that the saronite bombs would cause the outer platform to respawn, making the valkyrs a non-threat. This made it easier for them to deal with Defile, as half of the Defile would end up spawning off of the edge of the platform.<br />
<br />
Tens of guilds on 25-man, including mine, have been using saronite bombs everywhere on the platform--except for the edge, because we don't want to be instantly killed by valkyrs. The saronite bombs only renew the missing platforms if you drop them on the missing platforms.</div></div><hr />

<br />
1. These are very smart players and have been known to try and use game mechanics to their advantage before. It's been well documented. Therefor it's a little difficult for me to believe they didn't know what these bombs were doing after a few attempts.<br />
<br />
2. It's been asked if they had players in their guild purposely power level engineering for this reason alone. It's not clear if they did it for this reason.<br />
<br />
3. Based on their past reputation and the extreme their guild goes to just for the sake of killing a boss in a video game they deserve this ban. <br />
<br />
Just a side note. I skimmed through Muqq's blog and have to laugh at how upset he got. Like taking candy away from a child. Please grow up.</div></div><hr />

You sir, have no clue what you are talking about. In case you missed it, I play in Ensidia. I got banned as well. I know what I'm talking about and I know the fight.

just relax, and let the hard mode begin.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
I think the whole saronite bombs being used in rotation has been settled for the most part. People should understand that this has been used and will continue to be used by some people. The problem with what Ensidia did is beyond this.<br />
<br />
They had already completed the Lich King on 10 man, they knew the fight in and out. If the floor, which didn't reemerge during the 10 man fight happened to come back in the 25 man fight, it means something is wrong, and with Blizzard that means you need to report it.<br />
<br />
Guilds that reap the rewards of a bug to gain a world first or any kill for that matter are exploiting when they specifically know it isn't supposed to happen (which Ensidia said they did). Rightfully they should have stopped and reported it and waited for a hotfix, but they didn't because they were so wrapped up with getting the world first. <br />
<br />
Agree or disagree, Blizzard didn't and that's why they got banned. You can't really fault either side to be honest, and the rogue was perfectly capable of using saronite bombs. I think what it comes down to is Ensidia knowing that the floor shouldn't have regenerated and running with it, that's exploiting 101. <br />
<br />
72 hours isn't a big deal, they should buck up. Exodus got the same punishment for a similar exploit, something that happened during a fight and was eventually completed using it, they also should have stopped and wiped the raid instead of going through with it.<br />
<br />
The ban is just.</div></div><hr />

I dont think we need anymore clarification on this now, it was an undeserved ban and still a World First.<br />
It has just been proved that it was a part of the rogue Naihiko's standard rotation using the Saronite Bombs. They only used 4 tries and somehow managed to figure that Saronite Bombs magically managed to recreate the floor?<br />
I cant see who, in their right mind, would draw parallels between Saronite Bombs and a stationary platform rebuilding. I simply cant.<br />
As this exploit didnt even occur in 10 man I see even less validation for assuming that they actually had a clue what was causing the bug. Congratulations to Ensidia on World First, looking forward to the hardmodes now :)<br />

<br />
Tens of guilds on 25-man, including mine, have been using saronite bombs everywhere on the platform--except for the edge, because we don't want to be instantly killed by valkyrs. The saronite bombs only renew the missing platforms if you drop them on the missing platforms.<br />
<br />
<br />
Fact of the matter is, you don't know exactly what happened, because you weren't there, yet you've already condemned them.<br />
Bashing Ensidia is popular these days anyway.<br />
<br />
Till I see some absolute proof that they INTENDED to use the bug to make the encounter easier for them I'm going to go ahead and believe Ensidia.<br />
<br />
People who have already condemned Ensidia will always find things that point to guilt, just as people who believe in their innocense will always find things that point to innocense.<br />
<br />
I for one, believe in 'Innocent till proven guilty'<br />

Once the platform was seen to respawn... did they open a trouble ticket? It should have been clear that wasn't supposed to happen, even if they didn't know why it was happening.<br />
<br />
But in any case, the fight was not won legitimately, and it wasn't a creative use of game mechanics, it was a bug. No awards should exist under these conditions. And no world firsts should be acknowledged.</div></div><hr />

<br />
It really is that simple. If this is simply a case of Blizzard playing it safe while they investigate, there should be nothing incriminating in the video you undoubtedly recorded of the encounter. So, let's see it.<br />
<br />
I'm willing to give Ensidia the benefit of the doubt here. In the past, Blizzard has in fact banned first and asked questions later, as they did to everyone online in the guild of the individual one-shotting Ulduar bosses with Martin Fury. And yet, I find it a little suspicious when it's become so commonplace for these guilds to publish videos of their successful attempts, that there's nothing of their successful attempt with the last boss of the expansion.</div></div><hr />

A few hours ago, all the players involved in the Lich King 25 world first kill of Ensidia had their account suspended for 72 hours, Gamemasters also removed the achievements and loot acquired during yesterday's raid. <br />
<br />
Date of Violation: 03/02/2010<br />
Type of violation: Exploitation – Abuse of in-game mechanics or glitches with intent to exploit or cheat in World of Warcraft.<br />
Details: Use of Saronite Bombs to bypass The Lich King fight mechanics Consequences for Account: Account suspended for 72 hours, all items and achievements gained removed<br />
<br />
This isn't my place to discuss whether the ban is rightful or not, however Ensidia was nice enough to provide me with more information. <br />
<br />
First, it seems that the bug was caused by a single rogue (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Tarren%20Mill&amp;n=Naihiko) (always blame it on the rogues!) who used Saronite Bombs (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41119/saronite-bomb/) throughout the fight. Apparently the siege damage caused by the bombs bugged the encounter's mechanics and respawned the platform destroyed by the Lich King during the encounter. <br />
<br />
It results in the fight being fairly easier because you end up with more room to move and more importantly, you do not have to care about Valkyrs taking away your raid members anymore. (They will just land on the rebuilt platform when they fall down) <br />
<br />
The problem with the Saronite Bombs (http://db.mmo-champion.com/i/41119/saronite-bomb/) is simple, a lot of rogues have been using them for the past months (and it's been documented on ElitistJerks for quite some time now) and a lot of high-end rogues who like to maximize their DPS just consider it part of their normal DPS rotation. <br />

These logs clearly show that Naihiko (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Tarren%20Mill&amp;n=Naihiko) uses Saronite Bombs all the time, and we're talking about a raid who never saw the Lich King and couldn't really know that it would bug the encounter. Additionally, I took the time to screenshot Naihiko (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Tarren%20Mill&amp;n=Naihiko)'s damage report during his last 5 raids. (I realize that two raids are in the same week, this is only because he used his alt Naihika (http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-sheet.xml?r=Tarren%20Mill&amp;n=Naihika))<br />

Of course, all these screenshots are based on text logs and I do realize that they can be modified easily (but it does look like a lot of work to include so many entries). The only &quot;wrong&quot; thing Ensidia did is to keep going and kill the boss with the bug because they had no way to identify the source of the problem. Even going through raw combat logs (http://paste.wowace.com/zfhorvdl57nw820b/) wouldn't help because it looks like they only show Saronite Bomb damaging NPCs.<br />
<br />
I also want to make it clear that I'm not trying to defend or attack anyone here, I just thought it could be a good thing to bring some more information to the discussion. Hopefully, it will start a more interesting and mature discussion about the issue, you totally have the right to think that Ensidia should be banned, just don't be aggressive about it in comments. (or in my mail (http://static.mmo-champion.com/mmoc/images/news/2010/january/lovemmo.jpg))<br />
<br />
<br />
Could you please ask Ensidia release a video to show how their rouges worked with bombs during the fight? Like the Exodus and Paragon had shown.<br />

They're called Raging Spirits, by the way. Apparently you don't know what you're talking about--which doesn't surprise me, considering you trivialized three separate aspects of the encounter by exploiting. Raging Spirits spawn during the outer platform phases, like I said. During the outer platform phases, the outer platform respawns no matter what. Again, that's not what is in question. What is in question is the outer platform spawning--via your exploit--during the Defile/Valkyr phases.</div></div><hr />

Plain and simple, Blizzard hadn't thought to test the saronite bombs in the encounter and a bug went by unnoticed. If a well-established technique (which I consider engineers using saronite bombs to be) ends up bugging the encounter the blame should be on Blizzard for not finding it ahead of time. It's not like the Warlock summoning exploit in ZA where you intentionally were trying to bypass known mechanics; this is a DPSer doing what he does best withing typical gameplay mechanics. What Blizzard should have done was remove the achievement + loot, and reset the Lich King so they could do it again after it was hotfixed. Not ban them for 3 days. That's crap.</div></div><hr />

Couldn't you just, you know, live without that massive dps boost once you figure out it might be causing something strange? LK's a 15 minute fight or so, we're talking about maybe 20k damage all up from one guy? I know you want to squeeze out every edge on world firsts, but really...<br />

Guilds that reap the rewards of a bug to gain a world first or any kill for that matter are exploiting when they specifically know it isn't supposed to happen (which Ensidia said they did).

Well, Each time a guild (especially Ensidia) is on race for the first kill (especially Arthas) you can be sure that a lot of GM/dev are in gm-mode above them, watching how the fight's going. So they would see the repop, and the exploit.<br />

Take it from someone who has been banned three times, 99% of the time you're suspended or banned it's because you were deliberately or associated with breaking the rules. Sometimes they will make a mistake with the Auction House and the whole &quot;farming&quot; thing, but they wouldn't just ban Ensidia because they found a bug.<br />
<br />
You can't take what Ensidia is saying for truth, they're not going to admit any wrong doing because Blizzard will probably never reveal their true reasons for the ban, as in any details of the encounter bug, it's policy.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Except I do, because I know the fight, and the fight is very specific. There is a very small, very specific amount of ways to kill this boss. How can you question what happened when you know that all of the rogue's saronite bombs hit enemies on the same specific boss attempt where their platforms respawned early? This PROVES that they tanked the Lich King and the adds at the edge of the platform, which PROVES that they knew that the valkyrs would not be a threat to them, because they were AWARE of the exploit. If the outer platform had not respawned early via the exploit, the valkyrs would have simply grabbed their raid members, flown 2 yards forward, and their raid members would have died one by one by one by one.<br />
<br />
It's as simple as knowing the fight.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They're called Raging Spirits, by the way. Apparently you don't know what you're talking about--which doesn't surprise me, considering you trivialized three separate aspects of the encounter by exploiting. Raging Spirits spawn during the outer platform phases, like I said. During the outer platform phases, the outer platform respawns no matter what. Again, that's not what is in question. What is in question is the outer platform spawning--via your exploit--during the Defile/Valkyr phases.<br />
<br />
<br />
You do realise that you asked when we hit the outer platform with bombs, right? I just explained that to you.</div></div><hr />

Bugs happen. The fact is they did it on 10 man, they knew the mechanics. Something went different in 25 and they decided to roll with it. It is their own faults and deserve the suspension. If they are so blazingly amazing they will go back in three days and kill him again.</div></div><hr />

I'll bite to this one too! What about Exodus they found a &quot;bug&quot; as you call this and used it to kill yogg 0 for a world first the result being they got banned.<br />
<br />
This is the same situation thank god blizzard finally banned them proving that they arent playing favorites. They have gotten away with far too much and its good that its finally stoped and maybe they might send there emails sooner rather then killing the boss while they can be the only ones that can exploit it.<br />

Till I see some absolute proof that they INTENDED to use the bug to make the encounter easier for them I'm going to go ahead and believe Ensidia.<br />

People who have already condemned Ensidia will always find things that point to guilt, just as people who believe in their innocense will always find things that point to innocense.<br />

I for one, believe in 'Innocent till proven guilty'<br />

(Oh, and for people that keep referring to the alledged previous cheats and exploits, get over it. Most of those have been proven false, or have no evidence what so ever to back up the claims.)<br />
<br />
<br />
So the fact that Blizzard imposed a ban isnt enough proof to you that there is enough evidence of exploitation?The proof registers in this instance indirectly.In other words, though Blizzard making a mistake isnt impossible, i would definetly call it highly impropable.Honestly, when you got access to combat and chat logs and when Blizzard staff is present in such kill attempts(invisible obviously) would you think that they proceeded to such an act without enough evidence?As i said highly unlikely.</div></div><hr />

Most, or atleast very many Ensidia members have an alt of the same class and specc, to increase the allowed attempts each week. I think lots of other top-guilds use this mechanic also.<br />
<br />
On topic: If it is as Tun says, and they kill the adds on the platform (I haven't done the fight myself) I'd say it would be legit to take away the achievment and loot, as it seems the diffuculty of the fight decreases alot. But hell no they should recieve a ban for this, it's not thier fault blizz can't make the boss-mechanic work as intended.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and now my theory.. Ensidia did attempts before the kill, and since the bombs is a part of the rogues normal routine, then he also used them on the attempts, so they must have known.. for once they got busted and now they're all QQ about it, I heard they bugged some flowers too in Ulduar? dunno how that worked but a lot of people got upset about it.. <br />

1) Fix the bug<br />
2) Respawn the Lich King for the lockout (taking into account the attempts they had already used up)<br />
3) Allowed them to kill the Lich King normally with the remaining attempts (something I have no doubt they would have managed)</div></div><hr />

I understand that there is a world first at stake, but this was an unknown encounter by every one other than Blizzard.

Burden of proof lies in your hands.<br />
<br />
You admitted to knowing it was a bug, your kill shot is shown with the perimeter still intact, and on top of that you had already killed the Lich King on 10 man, so the mechanics were not new.<br />

<br />
1. These are very smart players and have been known to try and use game mechanics to their advantage before. It's been well documented. Therefor it's a little difficult for me to believe they didn't know what these bombs were doing after a few attempts.<br />
<br />
2. It's been asked if they had players in their guild purposely power level engineering for this reason alone. It's not clear if they did it for this reason.<br />
<br />
3. Based on their past reputation and the extreme their guild goes to just for the sake of killing a boss in a video game they deserve this ban. <br />

<br />
Think about it.<br />
<br />
<br />
Really if you get down to it they might've had four attempts in 25 man, but do you honestly want to believe that they didn't figure this out in their 10 man raid when they downed him? I tried looking for the logs just to see on WoL, but couldn't them on the Tarren Mill server.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard doesn't test their stuff, then this happens.<br />
<br />
FU Blizzard; how about you lay off your testers and hire new ones<br />
<br />
<br />
Regardless of how much you disagree with anything there is bound to be bugs. You could test the event a billion times and always miss over one thing that could or could not be game breaking. Programming isn't easy and the bigger your code the higher chance you have of there being a bug. So far it looks like this one is the only one.<br />
<br />
As for the Valk'yr change I'm guessing its more intended for them to speed up as they didn't want everyone to rely on a Death Knight to death grip them over. As not everyone in a 10 man encounter will have one for those purposes and on some 25 mans there might be one missing that night as well.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Ye blizz you are big joke box and owned uself by baning best players in world for shit, thanks alot topic autor for clear info and logs posted, *thumbs up* to ensidia and /spit blizz<br />
<br />
<br />
Ensidia is good, but I wouldn't say the best players in the world. There have been many posts in the past that point to them exploiting it, then being conveniently fixed. Clear info and logs? They show the rogue in question which is kind of convenient on their end. I was trying to find the log on their site as it would be interesting since someone said they saw it according to Ensidia's armory that some of the tanks and dps leveled engineering for that raid. Which would make sense since they might've discovered said bug in their 10 man raid.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
wow Blizztard is really embarrassing themselves.. so unfair ban, can't see why I should keep on playing this crappy game, after sunwell it have only got worse and worse.. Lich King killed in 11 whipes.. WOW!! last boss!!! 11 whipes!! really hard boss!<br />
<br />
<br />
Yet, I'm sure you missed the blue's post saying that normal difficulty is for everyone to see. Hard mode is where the challenge begins. Now if he's cleared in 11 wipes then yes, he would probably be under tuned. Until then it could be a few weeks before we even see Lich King attempted on Hard Mode. Depends on how hard Professor, Blood Queen and Sindragosa prove to be as all three have to be done on Heroic mode in the same reset while having limited number attempts.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
It has just been proved that it was a part of the rogue Naihiko's standard rotation using the Saronite Bombs. They only used 4 tries and somehow managed to figure that Saronite Bombs magically managed to recreate the floor?<br />
I cant see who, in their right mind, would draw parallels between Saronite Bombs and a stationary platform rebuilding. I simply cant.<br />
As this exploit didnt even occur in 10 man I see even less validation for assuming that they actually had a clue what was causing the bug. Congratulations to Ensidia on World First, looking forward to the hardmodes now :)<br />
<br />
Sphinxz<br />
<br />
<br />
In the rogue standard's rotation was never any question of doubt as that's completely possible. I don't know where people are getting 4 attempts from as 1) They had a 10 man 2) Who knows if they attempted with an &quot;alt&quot; raid as some guilds due if they think they stand a chance. That way they can experience the fight blow their attempts at trying to get it an fine tune it.<br />
<br />
Who said it didn't show up in the 10 man? Just because they didn't note it doesn't mean that it might not have been there. My guess would be Blizzard saw the same exploit used in 10 man thus furthering their reason for the ban, but thats just a theory.</div></div><hr />

Maybe you are right, Boubouille. Maybe they didn't know what caused the ice the 'unmelt'. Did they continue to do damage to the Valkyrs after the bug happened? Why one Earth are thy even close enough to the edge for these saronite bombs to hit the missing platform? But even if we entertain the though of giving them the benefit of the doubt, we have a repeated history of Ensidia's shady acts on key encounters. <br />
<br />
Disgusting Oozelings on C'thun.<br />
One shot of an obviously bugged Lady Vashj.<br />
Flower Power on Hodir.<br />
<br />
and now<br />
<br />
Tossing bombs off the edge of the platform to respawn the Frozen Thrown on Arthas.<br />
<br />
If it had been any other guild, they would have been banned much sooner (probably when the encounter was in progress ::) ).</div></div><hr />

You admitted to knowing it was a bug, your kill shot is shown with the perimeter still intact, and on top of that you had already killed the Lich King on 10 man, so the mechanics were not new.<br />
<br />
You can't argue ignorance, it doesn't work, especially after you acknowledge it.<br />
<br />
<br />
So I guess your ignorance rule out bugs oocouring in either none or both of 10/25?<br />
Not saying this is the case but you are really ignorant when ruling out bugs occouring in just one of them.<br />
Just saying...</div></div><hr />

People like you posting absurd remarks, that they INTENTIONALLY used an exploit need to get outta the house and stop with the conspiracy theories.<br />
<br />
This is a BRAND new fight, never seen on PTR, no one has EVER done it before, and people are saying things like &quot;they purposely had ppl level eng. to do this&quot;...<br />
<br />
seriously people??? are you accusing them of being able to see the future? <br />
<br />
and of course ensidia/nihlium are always accused or discover bugs...THEY are ALWAYS the first people to do fights, kinda common sense that the first people to do a new untested fight should in theory be the first to see if there are bugs.<br />
<br />
end of the day they are just players, not computer programmers. If you are doing a fight using the same exact rotation you use in every other fight and something becomes bugged, out of 25 players in the right casting hundreds of spells you wanted them to know on the spot &quot;oh its the saronite bombs better stop&quot;<br />
<br />
this is blizzard messing up programming yet again as they do countless time in the game and trying to shift blame away from the fact that they cannot produce a bug free or issue fight ever<br />
people are just looking for reasons to troll either because they have some jealousy grudge against Ensidia or they are just bored and lonely n looking for reasons to be tools.</div></div><hr />

I just wanted to say thank you so much for the additional detail - this makes this site great, quick and great communication on matters of interest! :)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
And for Hothgor on &quot;Flower Power on Hodir&quot; - it was a hardmode that was bugged (unkillable, modified by Blizzard later), but could only be killed via the flowerpower trick. If Ensidia would have not done it, Hodir would have been badly tuned for longer.<br />
<br />
I think we have to draw a line between cheating (e.g. modifying your stats, hacking servers) or using game mechanics to defeat a boss, despite developers &quot;original&quot; intent.</div></div><hr />

The people whom posted in that topic are, really, really sad. Insults to Ensidia because they simply found out a bug? The sad part is they don't even dare to post on their mains, but on level 1 alts. ???<br />

Europeans were never acting that retarded as some of you americans do. (sure there might've been some butthurt Europeans, but only on MMO, not on the wow-forums) Seriously, no-one could care less about an US guild being banned for an exploit. The difference is though, as been pointed out. Exodus was even worse, and still Americans were protecting them.</div></div><hr />

While it may have not been completely obvious why it was happening, they knew it was happening. Guilds that exploit an encounter have been getting bans since the MC days. People keep saying everyone would have done the same, but that just isn't the case. And it isn't because of some moral reason for most people, it's the simple fact that if you are going for the world first, you know the fight is going to be reviewed by Blizz. You also know, if they find that you did something to make the fight easier, you will get banned. Even if they had no idea what was causing the bug, they did make the decision to continue the fight anyway, knowing this could happen.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard will never be able to catch all of the bugs, especially with not having the fight on the PTR. Many people seem to have no real concept of how programming often works. There may have not even been a bug to catch through 95% of their testing. Saronite bombs could have been working fine and then, towards the end of testing someone notices that when something happens, the floor doesn't always respawn properly. So someone goes in, and makes some changes to make sure the floor does respawn properly. All goes well, bug is fixed, they wrap up testing. But fixing that bug could have very well created a new bug.<br />
There are hundreds if not thousands of things a player can do during an encounter. The only real way, to catch every possible bug, is go through EVERY possible scenario of what 25 players could do during a fight, and then, after each bug they find, re test everything all over again from the beginning.</div></div><hr />

None of us were in on any of these encounters, including the Lich King, so for all we know they could have purposely exploited it from seeing it in 10 man, or they could have randomly accidentally used a saronite bomb during a phase and it somehow rebuilt the outer structure due to a bug with them completely ignoring it and not taking the chance that it'd bug out if they were to use it to their advantage. <br />
<br />
We don't know what happened, nor will we truly ever know exactly what happened, and making assumptions that we do that are completely based on our own bias towards Ensidia is asinine. People just not to stop caring so much about one guild does and play the game for themselves, I think more of you would be a lot happier if you tried doing so.</div></div><hr />

I mean, if guilds are trying to get a kill asap, how can you expect them to wait until a bug (which isn't their fault) on the encounter is fixed.<br />
<br />
I don't really care if people use game bugs intentionally or not. Bugs should not be there. Sure, they happen but then again punishing players for bug existance is doubtful since there is no way to know if people used those bugs intentionally or they just happened since both possibilities will have rather similar amount of &quot;proofs&quot;. It's like it was with Leviathan exploit and mass bans that hit some people who triggered a bug without even knowing it happened.<br />
<br />
So basicly, in most noone can prove that some guild used a bug intentionally.</div></div><hr />

And well, I guess blizzard doesn't like that.<br />

<br />
The article says Ensidia had no way to identify the source of the problem, which I can either believe or not, doesn't really matter, since Ensidia did just play the game under Blizzard's explicit and implicit rules, they did not hack anything, nor they looked for ingenious exploits, it just came out of normal DPS rotations because of a bug which falls under Blizzard's responsibility. Surely not something to ban users for.<br />
<br />
Blizzard might as well ban its own developers for 72 hours, instead of Ensidia, for testing the fight not good enough.<br />
<br />
But well, it's not like Blizzard can modify the time-line, altho sometimes they act as wanna-be-Nozdormu, maybe they should stop roleplaying at the headquarters. Ensidia got Lich King 25 world first, end of story. A bugged Lich King, too bad of Blizzard.<br />
<br />
And too bad this decision goes together with nerd-raging kiddos who can't stand with Ensidia's being better than 'em at WoW.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Scigodomega</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 05:26 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">I believe Ensidia discoered the bug in their first couple attempts, then deliberately decided to exploit it.<br />
<br />
This answers another question. Some have asked why in their kill picture, ensidia had the chat bar area all censored out? I think this is why.<br />
<br />
andIm willing to bet that during the course of their investigation, blizz went through the chatlogs, and discovered that the players had indeed found the bug (talking about it in chat) and instead of deciding to report it, decided to xploit it.. so they censored their chat bar in the world first picture so people wouldnt see that.<br />
<br />
It also makes sense as to why blizz would ban them if that were true.<br />
Afterall if it was a bug, and no one in the fight was truly aware of it, and it just happened blizz wouldnt have banned them, because Ive seen that happen before, where a fight is bugged and no one realizes it.. No ban results.<br />
<br />
So the fact that they got banned leads me to believe that they figured it out, became aware, and made a decision as a raid to cover it up, then censored in in their photo. Thats my hypothesis atleast</div></div><hr />

The log has nothing at all to do with this. Ensidia has been in this same situation a number of times before. They know when they stumble upon a bug, and yet when they choose to continue on and use the bug to gain a victory that's when it becomes an exploit. They deserved everything they got and they should probably consider themselves lucky.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The game became very very simple. Blizzard wants to people to see content, but not wants them to defeat it too fast.<br />
<br />
There are few guilds that are way better players then others. The game is easy for them, and they one-shot every content Blizzard comes with. But you cannot make content harder since majority of players will not be able to see it.<br />
<br />
So the solution is: get rid of good players.<br />
<br />
Remember 3.0. One-shotted in mere hours by Nihilum/Twentyfifth november/Ensidia.<br />
So Blizzard came with Ulduar which was non-linear, and the only purpose was to not let any guild get all world firsts.<br />
<br />
This was proven to be kinda solution so Blizzard came with idea of gating (not first time) to artificially slow down progress in ICC. I think everyone understands that there was no reason for gating except to slow down progress?<br />
<br />
Still that is not enough, you see. Same guilds get world firsts again and again, with linear or non-linear progression, with gating or without. So the inevitable happened. Ensidia was banned so they knew their place.<br />
<br />
Now, all of you Ensidia haters and Exodus, Blood Legion, [insert name here] fans.<br />
There is one small problem.<br />
It's not actually about Ensidia. It's not even about Blizzard failing to test encounters again and again.<br />
<br />
Your favorite guilds are next in line to be banned and thrown out of game so we all have an illusion of complexity and safety.<br />
Whenever any guild will get too much world firsts, it will be accused, banned and kicked out so others could compete.<br />
<br />
It's a simple management decision. Contest is less fun when you know the winner from start. Kick him out, disqualify, ban, whoosh, contest is fresh and everyone have a chance to win.</div></div><hr />

<br />
the thing is that they had 10 atempts on LK before they killed him they obviously noticed that the floor was respawing when it OBVIOUSLY was not part of the fight, seen as they already killed it on 10man and say that this glitch was not found on 10man, and that it made a big part of the next phases trivial as they could ignore switching dps to valkyre and just nuke LK instead as the person being carried by the valkyre would be dropped off on the edge that had now respawned and they could jus run back to LK instead of falling to thier death.<br />
<br />
so for them to know that the fight was glitching and making a huge mechanic of the fight able to be ignored they willinging used the glitch to help them obtain world 1st kill! it dosnt matter if they know how it was happening or not THEY KNEW IT WAS GLITCHED AND THEY USED IT TO THIER ADVANTAGE!<br />
<br />
the easiest way to solve this is to post their video, i refuse to belive that no1 in ensidia fraps'd thier attempts on LK while going for world 1st, so untill they post the video with ventrilo/ts or chat logs to prove they they had no idea what was going on and just kept attempting the boss WITHOUT saying 'oh look the floor keeps respawning lets keep going so we can make the fight easier and get world 1st' then i will side with the fact that THEY DID KNOW what they where doing and it was a blatent choice they made to get world 1st.<br />
<br />
they really could have just stopped the fight made a ticket and then killed it after making the glitch known to GM's then all this would have been prevented.</div></div><hr />

My future comments on this situation, if I have any, will be on my website and forums:<br />

http://www.uprisingap.com/<br />
http://forums.uprisingap.com/index.cgi?board=general&amp;action=display&amp;thread=1817<br />
<br />
But basically I'll post my current conclusion from our forums:<br />
<br />
No other guild has experienced the Respawning Outer Platform Bug because they tank Lich King and the adds in the center of the room. They tank them there because everyone needs to be near the center to avoid being killed by valkyrs. If you put a Saronite Bomb on where the Outer Platform used to be, it will cause the Outer Platform to respawn. Ensidia somehow figured this out.<br />
<br />
In their kill log, every single one of the rogue's Saronite Bombs causes damage to enemies. This means that the Lich King, the adds, or both were tanked at the very edge of the platform, so that the Saronite Bombs would be able to hit the empty space where the Outer Platform used to be, and respawn the Outer Platform. In an ordinary situation, if you have DPS standing at the edge during this phase, they can get picked up by a valkyr and instantly killed. But in Ensidia's situation, they knew that the Outer Platform would respawn because of the bombs. Therefore, the valkyr would pick someone up, walk 2 yards forward, and then simply let them go. The person would fall on the respawned Outer Platform, and they could continue to DPS the Lich King and the adds.<br />
<br />
Being on the outside of the platform throughout this entire phase also allowed Defile to spawn on the outside of the platform, which meant that half of their Defiles spawned beyond the platform's edge.<br />
<br />
I am waiting on Kungen to show me Damage to Val'kyr Shadowguard. If he shows me that the raid, on their kill, did significant damage to Val'kyr Shadowguard, then this is still up for debate. If he can't show me this, then that proves that they intentionally skipped over an entire aspect of the fight, and simplified Defile.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">stupid11</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 06:03 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Lol. I would suggest Blizzard developers to get some Law degree. It might help 'em to see stuff like this from a smarter point of view.<br />
<br />
The article says Ensidia had no way to identify the source of the problem, which I can either believe or not, doesn't really matter, since Ensidia did just play the game under Blizzard's explicit and implicit rules, they did not hack anything, nor they looked for ingenious exploits, it just came out of normal DPS rotations because of a bug which falls under Blizzard's responsibility. Surely not something to ban users for.<br />
<br />
Blizzard might as well ban its own developers for 72 hours, instead of Ensidia, for testing the fight not good enough.<br />
<br />
But well, it's not like Blizzard can modify the time-line, altho sometimes they act as wanna-be-Nozdormu, maybe they should stop roleplaying at the headquarters. Ensidia got Lich King 25 world first, end of story. A bugged Lich King, too bad of Blizzard.<br />
<br />
And too bad this decision goes together with nerd-raging kiddos who can't stand with Ensidia's being better than 'em at WoW.<br />
<br />

While it may have not been completely obvious why it was happening, they knew it was happening. Guilds that exploit an encounter have been getting bans since the MC days. People keep saying everyone would have done the same, but that just isn't the case. And it isn't because of some moral reason for most people, it's the simple fact that if you are going for the world first, you know the fight is going to be reviewed by Blizz. You also know, if they find that you did something to make the fight easier, you will get banned. Even if they had no idea what was causing the bug, they did make the decision to continue the fight anyway, knowing this could happen.<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard will never be able to catch all of the bugs, especially with not having the fight on the PTR. Many people seem to have no real concept of how programming often works. There may have not even been a bug to catch through 95% of their testing. Saronite bombs could have been working fine and then, towards the end of testing someone notices that when something happens, the floor doesn't always respawn properly. So someone goes in, and makes some changes to make sure the floor does respawn properly. All goes well, bug is fixed, they wrap up testing. But fixing that bug could have very well created a new bug.<br />
There are hundreds if not thousands of things a player can do during an encounter. The only real way, to catch every possible bug, is go through EVERY possible scenario of what 25 players could do during a fight, and then, after each bug they find, re test everything all over again from the beginning.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Also, Blizzard will never be able to catch all of the bugs, especially with not having the fight on the PTR<br />
BLIZZ chose to have it this way ie. they obviously release poor unchecked code. Its their call Im just pointing out the fact that this is the unavaoidable result of their decision.<br />
<br />
On a personal note I think it is to say the least odd that not one or more of the numerous GMs watching Ensidias raid didnt take action right there. They somehow mysteriously missed that the platform didnt behave like it should? They had to have a little 24h meeting to talk it over? If this was a clear cut exploit (and Im not convinced yet) nothing can excuse it for being used but at the same time it pretty much show how:<br />
A: insanely poor BLIZZ code and testing is <br />
B: their GMs watching have no clue at all about the fight since they missed spotting it<br />
<br />
Programming is tricky I do alot myself on the other hand I would not semiblame the user for my own misstakes regarding the code itself and most importantly its testing. If I write complex code I make damn sure it is tested accordingly compared to much simpler code.<br />
Exploit or not, BLIZZ should really good look upon how they chose to release code.<br />
<br />
Ensidia will have no trouble getting their major share of FTK's anyway. <br />
The players who spot a possible or clear bug are simply the most innovative and dedicated players and it is exactly that type of player that got the skill needed to be #1 without using exploits. <br />
Too bad a possible ego make ppl take nonallowed shortcuts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
But basically I'll post my current conclusion from our forums:<br />
<br />
No other guild has experienced the Respawning Outer Platform Bug because they tank Lich King and the adds in the center of the room. They tank them there because everyone needs to be near the center to avoid being killed by valkyrs. If you put a Saronite Bomb on where the Outer Platform used to be, it will cause the Outer Platform to respawn. Ensidia somehow figured this out.<br />
<br />
In their kill log, every single one of the rogue's Saronite Bombs causes damage to enemies. This means that the Lich King, the adds, or both were tanked at the very edge of the platform, so that the Saronite Bombs would be able to hit the empty space where the Outer Platform used to be, and respawn the Outer Platform. In an ordinary situation, if you have DPS standing at the edge during this phase, they can get picked up by a valkyr and instantly killed.

The person would fall on the respawned Outer Platform, and they could continue to DPS the Lich King and the adds.<br />

If he can't show me this, then that proves that they intentionally skipped over an entire aspect of the fight, and simplified Defile. <br />

<br />
Well, obviously Ensidia's case is less severe. They MIGHT have intentionally bugged, it might have been accidental. We don't know. All we know is that they achieved world first because of a bug. Therefore, a less severe situation deserves a less severe punishment.</div></div><hr />

Blizzard missed a huge problem with that encounter and should first determine if their actions were intentional or not. Giving them the chance to do the encounter fair and square would be more appropriate instead of a long ban which is likely with the intention of ensuring that someone else now beats them to it, a much more severe punishment than any loot removal and simply having to do it again. The internal testing was not upto scratch, that much is clear and now players are being penalised because they were able to gain an advantage from it, knowingly or otherwise is only part of the issue.<br />

<br />
2) Bunch of &quot;new readers&quot; created by Ensidia members to try to appear that &quot;other players believe in us!&quot;<br />
<br />
3) They had it comming after so many &quot;clever use of game mechanics&quot;. Well deserved ban... in fact should be way more.<br />
<br />
4) They're not stupid, they're really smart and good players. They CAN figure out something is wrong really fast or they would never be able to figure out a encounter and beat it without someone giving strats to them. They figured out it happened on 25 man because of the bomb and did what they always do. Use it, get the &quot;world 1st recognition&quot; and then report to blizzard. Now they become &quot;nice players who reported the bug to blizzard&quot; with a easier world 1st in their pockets that every other guild will have to try the &quot;harder&quot; (and supposed to be) way.<br />
<br />
5) As I said, they had it comming... Blizzards fault was not punishing them before while they've punished other guilds that could cry out &quot;it's blizzard's fault, it's their bug!&quot; like Ensidia does now. It's not only a world 1st at stake, it's heroic mode unlocked for them 1st (that leads to more world's 1st without deserving it) and on top of all that, world 1st of the &quot;boss of the bosses&quot;... Lich King... Blizzard IS paying close attention to those world 1sts...</div></div><hr />

Ensidia has a record of stretching the rules as far as possible while trying to stay below the threshold they think would result in a suspension. Remember the flower power on Hodir? Their MO has always been abuse then report. Maybe Blizzard made a list of not actionable items on their part that were certainly questionable.<br />
<br />
Somebody on Blizzard's side probably viewed this as a last straw and decided they did too many questionable things in the past.</div></div><hr />

i think they should of repoerted it before finishing it, at least then they have some sort of evidence that they did report it while trying.<br />

Personally I'm not even sure that it was Saronite that caused it. I believe it was a bug in the encounter that caused it to happen, especially since the bombs did 0.000 siege damage. To me it just looks like that wanted a reason to ban us. If it actually was the saronites then there is no way in the universe that we could possibly have known that since they only did damage to the mobs Naihiko used them on. There was no extra damage on anything else. <br />
<br />
We got banned for raiding and that's it. <br />
<br />
On a side note. Every end boss in the game has had at least one bug since Vanilla for the first guilds reaching it. Onyxia, Ragnaros, Nefarion, C'thun, Kel'Thuzad, Gruul, Magtheridon, Vashj, Kael'Thas, Archimonde, Illidan, Kil'Jaden and the list continue all the way up to Arthas. <br />

In phase 2 of the encounter. Val'kryls swoop down, pick up raid members and drop em toward the edge of the rim. If the platform remains intact, then that intended (as in, by design) &quot;danger&quot; within phase 2 can be ignored.<br />

<br />
At approx 2:26 in the linked video, there is a visible, brightly-glowing graphic around the entire rim of the platform, the part that is getting ready to drop away. That is the entire circumference of the platform, not merely bits and pieces. The exploit was this:<br />
<br />
&quot;We just made a hotfix that disables the siege damage dealt by Saronite Bombs and the Global Thermal Sapper Charge. The siege damage of the bombs was causing the Frozen Throne platform to rebuild, which greatly decreases the difficulty of the encounter.<br />
<br />
We'll reenable the siege damage in a later update when the issue with the Frozen Throne is fixed.&quot;<br />
<br />
Ensidia already has the achieve for downing the Lich King in 10-man mode prior to the kill in 25. What are the odds that they somehow missed that HUGE area of the platform getting ready to drop away, or the fact that the engineer bombs were rebuilding the platform.<br />

bombs on ghouls end at 1:33:57 then the next bomb is on lk/fordring 7 mins later (skipping the entire valkyr phase)<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Log doctoring opens a whole 'nother can of worms, but an AIM discussion with my roommate seems to provide the other ugly fact.<br />
<br />
You can't claim this was an &quot;accident&quot; fight mechanics prevent it from being the case.<br />
<br />
(12:41:22 PM) ***: ok in reading wowhead comments on saronite bombs, erm yeah ensidia exploited that on purpose<br />
(12:42:05 PM) ***: There is no way they discovered this bug accidentally, because everyone has to be near the center of the platform to avoid being dragged off of the platform by valkyrs too early. This means you tank Lich King near the center, and this means there is absolutely no reason to run all the way to the edge of the platform and plant a saronite bomb on a ledge that is no longer there. <br />
<br />
You can look up Ensidia's armories right now and see that many of them powerleveled engineering today--many of them healers.<br />
<br />
Time for a little armory search, methinks.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ever consider that since, as they said, it's part of the players standard rotation that they had no clue what could have been causing the structure to rebuild? I mean when you honestly think about it then it's perfectly logical that even if the saronite bombs reliably did it that it would be very difficult to figure out what was causing it exactly because you have 25 people doing their normal rotations and nothing different than from any other encounter. <br />
<br />
When you have something like that happening and ask to your raid, how the hell did that happen, when no one was doing anything abnormal for them then it's completely likely that they had no clue what was causing it and therefor couldn't tell someone to stop doing what was causing it. <br />
<br />
People need to realize stuff like this and not just completely assume that they knew exactly what was going on. As has been stated before, this is a new encounter that no one has ever seen except on their 10 man attempts so it's likely to have bugs and the majority of bugs that occur in these kinds of situations are very difficult to pin point out why they occur.</div></div><hr />

They said why would we stop on a boss with limited attemps...i say if u notice something is wrong quit the fight and wait the GM...If they are so sure about themselve's they could easilly get world's first again..But if u are afraid of someone else might catch up? gg qq moo!</div></div><hr />

LK was exploited wither it was on purpose or not they had all their rewards taken away and banned so y are we still goin on about it.. its now in the past, it has been hotfixed might as well move on and focus on your own raiding progress<br />

and if they did do it on purpose one phrase comes to mind &quot;If you cant do the time then dont do the crime&quot; theyll just have to redo it wen they are able to log back on <br />

You do realize that the Complaints will ALWAYS be the majority of any thread. No matter what the topic, etc. Complaints will always win out. It's just like reviews, people don't go some place they like, and run home to write a review, as they are happy. But if they go some place, and it's a disaster, they'll be angry, and will definitely go out of their way to write a negative review. The same is true here. So until you go through both threads and show me that all the posts are from the same people, I think you're the one who doesn't understand forums.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mirrorzoom</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 06:43 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Stop arguing about the rogues and the saronite bombs w/e, it doesn't matter how they &quot;discover&quot; the bug. The fact is that they didn't report it, and probably used the bug to their advantage.<br />
<br />
They don't have to figure out what caused the bug. Since they've already done 10man, it's not that hard to figure out that this platform respawning isn't intentional. What did they do? They kept going and got world first kill. Then they didn't even mention it on their world first kill that this bug existed until blizzard hotfixed it. <br />
<br />
I don't have the time to go through the logs to see if they actually used the bug to their advantage or not. If you look at the valkyr phase, did they dps the valkyr like they are supposed to? or did they let the valkyr run away and drop the player on the edge? If it's the latter case, they definitely used the bug to their advantage, which is 100% exploitation. On that note, there's a post in page 9 here showed that the rogue didn't use any bombs in the entire valkyr phase. If that's true, the entire combat log should be voided because it's been modified. Other than the valkyrs, this bug also gives bigger space to run for defile, but that's not as big of a deal. <br />
<br />
The bottom line is that doesn't matter who, where, how, but the bug appeared, and anyone who have done the fight somewhat on 10man can tell that it's not intentional. Ensidia didn't report the bug, kept going while using the bug to their advantage, didn't acknowledge it until blizzard hotfixed it. <br />
<br />
That is exploiting.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Diadatan</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 06:45 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Before you all assume I'm an ensidia fanboy, let me tell you now, I am not. I am a raiding member of Exodus US Ysondre.<br />
<br />
<br />
Ensidia should not have received 3-day suspension + removal of goodies treatment. Neither should we have on Yogg-No Light.<br />
<br />
There are two reasons why blizzard claims to be justified in suspending accounts for these situations. <br />
<br />
(my own wording)<br />
1. Circumvention of game mechanics to achieve unintended ease of victory.<br />
2. Deliberate attempt to mislead in order to cover up circumventive play.<br />
<br />
<br />
To these two claims I give you two rebuttals:<br />
<br />
1. Game mechanics were not circumvented. The only exploit I have ever heard of that actually involved circumvention of game mechanics was the guild that edited their mpq files to fall through the floor in AQ to go straight to C'thun. That, obviously, is cheating.<br />
<br />
However, Saronite bombs rebuilding the platform is a GAME MECHANIC. (it isn't anymore, but that just reinforces the point now doesn't it?) It was a part of the live build of the game. The fact that it makes the encounter much easier, the fact that it was unintended, those things are irrelevant. Warcraft is a computer game. 100% variable environment. Blizzard has absolute control over what can and cannot occur in the game. <br />
<br />
I have no programming expertise and cannot speak to how difficult it is to properly code encounters to avoid situations like this, but I lay the burden of ensuring bosses are killed the way Blizzard intended, WITH BLIZZARD, not with the player. This strikes particularly strongly for an encounter that was not availible for testing on the ptr. While I agree with that decision, its obvious blizzard's internal testing of that encounter was inadequate. (one can only hope the irresponsible element in blizzard's QA apparatus were punished also.)<br />
<br />
2. Responding to the notion of deception, this is much more simple. Guilds cannot control what their members say on forums, on ventrilo, or to blizzard, each raid member must be treated individually for this allegation. As for me, when Exodus killed Yogg 0 watcher, I never told anyone we killed it &quot;traditionally&quot; or &quot;without cheating&quot; or &quot;without circumventing&quot; or however you would like to describe it. However in the email I received informing me of my suspension, I was told part of the reason for the disciplinary action was because of deceptive efforts.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">bigjenk</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 06:48 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">If you look at the amount of damage the saronite bombs did in each fight outside of the lk they did on average 30-40 percent more damage which leads me to believe a fair amount of them were not targeted on a mob and instead on the ledge or whereever the exploit was.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Bluedevil21</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 06:51 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Oh, wow, really? Ensidia is allowed to post on public forums now? That's speaks.. miles.<br />
<br />
They're called Raging Spirits, by the way. Apparently you don't know what you're talking about--which doesn't surprise me, considering you trivialized three separate aspects of the encounter by exploiting. Raging Spirits spawn during the outer platform phases, like I said. During the outer platform phases, the outer platform respawns no matter what. Again, that's not what is in question. What is in question is the outer platform spawning--via your exploit--during the Defile/Valkyr phases.<br />
<br />
<br />
Bergg is my new hero; a Top end raider, punching back, asking questions that most of us wouldn't know unless personally doing the encounter. Glad to see more top end raiders involved; asking real questions that deserve real answers. <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Bergg this bug happened totally random on a few of the tries, it didn't even happen on all tries. Personally I'm not even sure that it was Saronite that caused it. I believe it was a bug in the encounter that caused it to happen, especially since the bombs did 0.000 siege damage. To me it just looks like that wanted a reason to ban us. If it actually was the saronites then there is no way in the universe that we could possibly have known that since they only did damage to the mobs Naihiko used them on. There was no extra damage on anything else. <br />
<br />
We got banned for raiding and that's it. <br />
<br />
On a side note. Every end boss in the game has had at least one bug since Vanilla for the first guilds reaching it. Onyxia, Ragnaros, Nefarion, C'thun, Kel'Thuzad, Gruul, Magtheridon, Vashj, Kael'Thas, Archimonde, Illidan, Kil'Jaden and the list continue all the way up to Arthas. <br />
<br />
Once again. Banned for raiding. <br />
<br />
<br />
Kungen, every great leader has to one day make a decision that nobody will agree with; some will even hate him/her for it, but the bottom line is this. You knew there was a bug, &amp; yet you continued raiding. You know just as much as any other top end raider, that the rule is &quot;if there is a bug, stop the encounter, report, standby.&quot; That should have been the call, 4th,5th,7th,9th,11th, whatever attempt. The rogue isn't at fault, you &amp; the other GM's of Ensidia are on the matter of the 25 players getting banned. <br />
<br />
Now in hindsight, look at the fact that no one still hasn't downed Arthas, technically I would go on to bet that had you A) stopped the raid once a bug was known B) informed Blizzard's GM Team of the issue c) let them hotfix the issue ???? You be sitting front page with the fact that Ensidia had not only informed blizzard of a bug, but still got world first on the encounter. Instead you have a past history (unproven) of exploits &amp; a 3-day ban basically for this: Killing a boss while a bug was in play regardless of using it or not. You weren't banned for raiding, you were banned raiding while a bug was active &amp; actively knew it. <br />
<br />
It doesn't stop here though, interviews, gaming expo's, future world first kills. You &amp; anyone else in that guild will have to answer questions or make responses on this encounter. Heaven I hope you all have addon's to block whispers from peeps not on that friends list come Sunday. <br />
<br />
As a fan of raiding in general, I'm asking next time, make the harder call &amp; report the bug.</div></div><hr />

<br />
LK was never tested publicly, which means that only a handful of QA testers (depending on the size of Blizzard's QA team), got to see the encounter pre-release. Firstly, QA testers' jobs are to find bugs in a game, but that's hard to do when you don't know what you're looking for. Secondly, a QA team is a relatively small number of people working a finite amount of time. When LK goes live, you suddenly go from MAYBE a team of a few dozen, to a mass of several thousand, if not more, people playing the game.<br />

You're what's wrong with a lot of people. You praise and embrace the concept of using unfair advantages for personal gain. It's just a game, yes, but if people don't even have honor or respect here, where do you think that shows?<br />
<br />
&quot;Sore losers who were last picked in kickball&quot; analogy doesn't even make sense, either...I get the concept, but it has no bearing on the situation, you moron.<br />
<br />
People were congratulating Ensidia and were happy with them. UNTIL everyone learned they abused the game for gain. We're not sore losers. We just don't like to see people get away with murder, especially since Ensidia likes to claim the moral high-ground on situations like this.<br />
<br />
This is all people needed to confirm it: they're good players, but they're absolute trash.<br />
<br />
Ban may not have been necessary, but stripping them of LK achievements is COMPLETELY warranted.<br />

<br />
&quot;Sore losers who were last picked in kickball&quot; analogy doesn't even make sense, either...I get the concept, but it has no bearing on the situation, you moron.<br />
<br />
People were congratulating Ensidia and were happy with them. UNTIL everyone learned they abused the game for gain. We're not sore losers. We just don't like to see people get away with murder, especially since Ensidia likes to claim the moral high-ground on situations like this.<br />
<br />
This is all people needed to confirm it: they're good players, but they're absolute trash.<br />
<br />
Ban may not have been necessary, but stripping them of LK achievements is COMPLETELY warranted.<br />
<br />
Let them do the fight the way it's intended now, like everyone else has to.<br />
<br />
<br />
You think you're any better than the guys who praise Ensidia regardless of what they may or not do? You, like everyone else here, are completely assuming you know what happened and what they did, but just like everyone else here you really don't have any clue.<br />
<br />
Again I say, it's amazing the bias people have and completely ignore it when voicing their opinion on this matter when all the facts are obviously not available to us making it impossible to make any real assumption as to what happened.</div></div><hr />

<br />
all he did was to use he's brain.(increase hes dps) which had a side effect (smart use of your own mechanics blizzard!) that made the fight easier. <br />
<br />
NONE here would honestly in their right mind (i dont care about 1 or two persons, you still have to convince the rest of the raid.) would stop using the grenades, maybe not even if you knew it bugged the fight. or take a 48 hour break(GG blizzard for lame Ticket response time.) so that you could kill the boss with proberly (and exspect the world to think you as of a knight on a white horse, no one gives a flying fuck about that shit.) World first is World first. and they would have gotten it anyways im sure.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
Ensidia should not have received 3-day suspension + removal of goodies treatment. Neither should we have on Yogg-No Light.<br />
<br />
There are two reasons why blizzard claims to be justified in suspending accounts for these situations. <br />
<br />
(my own wording)<br />
1. Circumvention of game mechanics to achieve unintended ease of victory.<br />
2. Deliberate attempt to mislead in order to cover up circumventive play.<br />
<br />
<br />
To these two claims I give you two rebuttals:<br />
<br />
1. Game mechanics were not circumvented. The only exploit I have ever heard of that actually involved circumvention of game mechanics was the guild that edited their mpq files to fall through the floor in AQ to go straight to C'thun. That, obviously, is cheating.<br />
<br />
However, Saronite bombs rebuilding the platform is a GAME MECHANIC. (it isn't anymore, but that just reinforces the point now doesn't it?) It was a part of the live build of the game. The fact that it makes the encounter much easier, the fact that it was unintended, those things are irrelevant. Warcraft is a computer game. 100% variable environment. Blizzard has absolute control over what can and cannot occur in the game. <br />
<br />
I have no programming expertise and cannot speak to how difficult it is to properly code encounters to avoid situations like this, but I lay the burden of ensuring bosses are killed the way Blizzard intended, WITH BLIZZARD, not with the player. This strikes particularly strongly for an encounter that was not availible for testing on the ptr. While I agree with that decision, its obvious blizzard's internal testing of that encounter was inadequate. (one can only hope the irresponsible element in blizzard's QA apparatus were punished also.)<br />
<br />
2. Responding to the notion of deception, this is much more simple. Guilds cannot control what their members say on forums, on ventrilo, or to blizzard, each raid member must be treated individually for this allegation. As for me, when Exodus killed Yogg 0 watcher, I never told anyone we killed it &quot;traditionally&quot; or &quot;without cheating&quot; or &quot;without circumventing&quot; or however you would like to describe it. However in the email I received informing me of my suspension, I was told part of the reason for the disciplinary action was because of deceptive efforts.</div></div><hr />

<br />
<br />
No bias.<br />
<br />
However due to the fact that they are unwilling to release a video and release in-depth combat logs, they're open to as much scrutiny as people can throw at them. If they want their name cleared, why not release some information, combat logs, a video, ANYTHING, about it? Are they afraid?<br />
<br />
I felt the same way during Exodus. They were caught red-handed, and whoever posted their news story had a complete meltdown, just like what happened with Muqq. They're both idiots.<br />
<br />
I don't follow anyone with blind faith. Ensidia's history is too shady to follow them without at least acknowledging that there might be a significant problem here. Given the fact that no guild has downed LK since Ensidia's encounter last night, shows something. The fight was much easier with the bomb mechanic than they're letting on.<br />
<br />
And please, the gap between Ensidia and the others isn't large enough that they're just &quot;that good.&quot; That's blind following.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Later on someone said that we didn't need to kill Valkyrs when the floor was here (that's one Valkyr of the course of multiple attempts that we failed to kill, and there's 3 of them each of the many waves we got). The idea at this point was pretty much that if this bug happened again then we could just leave the valkyrs and DPS on boss which made the encounter even more boring (add killing encounter for you) and in the end made P3 feel lighter on our empty stomachs. I think I heard someone saying at some point that the bug actually happened if we successfully cleared in a fast enough time frame the first wave of Valkyrs. Which proved wrong later on and on the actual kill.<br />

<br />
I approve the ban. And I was normally first pick or captain in kick ball.<br />
<br />
Furthermore, what are you going to do about it? <br />
<br />
The list has gone on long enough. Kungen's track record of bugging bosses is entirely too stacked. No tolerance attitude towards this is a good way to go about it. Perhaps then we can stop this from happening in the future. <br />
<br />
And for everyone mad at Blizzard for this. Keep in mind a. You aren't going to quit the game over this (lets be serious now) and b. The encounter is a difficult one, and one which involves a lot of work to create. An error like this probably was tested out and fixed, but on live it didn't work out. Who knows. You aren't the ones to judge them. They created a game which you play everyday.</div></div><hr />

<br />
bombs on ghouls end at 1:33:57 then the next bomb is on lk/fordring 7 mins later (skipping the entire valkyr phase)<br />
<br />
The combat log they gave is missing 7 and a half minutes <br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
All that needs to be said. The fact that they're circumventing providing any actual proof is pretty much an admission of guilt. They know they were exploiting and they know they were trivializing the entire encounter.<br />
<br />
And anyone who buys into the &quot;how were we supposed to know it was the saronite bombs&quot; excuse is a moron. This guild is pushing world firsts. And on a limited attempt boss, you can be sure that they're going to be going over combat logs and fraps of each attempt trying to pick apart the fight. <br />
<br />
But I guess innocent people cut out 7 1/2 minutes of their combat log to show that they're innocent. ::)</div></div><hr />

<br />
You got caught by one of the following.<br />
<br />
Caught in the act exploiting - By the time they probably got management to verify it was an actual exploit and how to proceed you had killed him and were already posting your world first kill.You know what any company is like ... they get management involved ... then PR people and then it probably went al the way up the chain to Mike Morhaime also to not only discuss the actual exploit but how to punish for it. ( that shit takes time ) <br />
<br />
Someone in one of your chat channels guild/officer/private messages probably added to the evidence that you were knowingly exploiting. ( again maybe another reason for the delay of action )<br />
<br />
Maybe no one from blizz was actually at the kill ( I find this difficult to beleive im sure someone was there ) and logs proved you guilty.<br />
<br />
You got this ban for a reason and you and blizzard are the only ones who know the truth so dont come whinning about it on here.<br />
<br />
The previous acusations of your other encounters wether they were accurate or not probably put you on the radar to be watched that little bit closer.<br />
<br />
<br />
Blizzard suspending the top guild in the world for exploiting is something they would of wanted to avoid im certain as the bad PR it gives is huge and im sure they want to avoid at all costs but you did something they could not turn their backs on, they must of had clear evidence of it.</div></div><hr />

Sorry, but you now openly admitted you knew you were exploiting.<br />
<br />
GG<br />
<br />
<br />
So it's starting to come out. Thanks for that.<br />
<br />
They knew it was a bug/exploit, and they continued to do it.<br />
<br />
Remember what they said about Exodus? &quot;We'd never kill an encounter like that&quot;<br />
<br />
There's the thing I have a problem with. Sorry.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Resetting the boss and giving them a warning would have been more acceptable after the hotfix of saronite bombs as well. A ban, wiping achievements/loot etc and leaving the boss dead is a shitty thing to do.</div></div><hr />

You can toss logs, parses and what not at the subject but untill we see the fight that took place and the rogue(s) not using the things to gain an advantage we will never know what exactly took place.<br />
<br />
Personally i highly doubt they did exploit it, since they knew they where being watched (As they always are on brandnew content) so any exploit that they may know would be picked up instantly by the gm('s) watching them fight.<br />
Why take such a risk on a normal mode world first that no-one will care about once hardmodes are unlocked?<br />
Risk-reward factor kinda goes against the exploit theory.<br />
<br />
But still, untill we see a killvid, we'll never know for sure.<br />
And the longer it takes to release one, the bigger this possibly false exploit story will get.<br />
Unless they have their reasons for not releasing one ofc..</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Hothgor</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 07:38 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">We can ALL be reasonably sure that Blizzard spent hundreds, if not thousands of hours on the Lich King encounter and others in ICC. Bugs happen, the majority of them get fixed in the ptr and we are mostly happy raiders on live. But some things need to be said:<br />
<br />
1. Blizzard's job is to design encounters, fix the bugs and ensure a playable environment.<br />
2. The VAST majority of guilds work within the design encounter boundary, avoid bugs and keep from getting banned.<br />
3. A SMALL minority of guilds/players look for every possible exploit to use to gimmick any aspect of this game.<br />
<br />
Ensidia falls into this category. All it takes is a look at their history.<br />
<br />
C'thun:<br />
<br />
Getting sucked into the stomach on phase 2 applied a stacking poison debuff that increased your damage taken. While down in the stomach, you had to dps tentacles to weaken him, but due to the stacking debuff you couldn't stay for long. At the time, WoW players/boss were coded in such a manner that only a limited number of buffs/debuffs could be active at any one time. Ensidia chose to 'push off' the stacking debuff by chain summoning oozelings, thereby allowing their raid members to remain inside the stomach for as long as they wanted, trivializing the fight.<br />
<br />
Lady Vash:<br />
<br />
Nothing needs to be said other than this: Dealing 1 damage to an obviously bugged mob to kill it and laughing all the way to Mount Hyjal and Black Temple was OBVIOUSLY an exploit. They should have soft reset the instance, but chose not too. That requires a deliberate act, not a spur of the moment 'how did this happen lets keep going on'.<br />
<br />
Twin Ereder:<br />
<br />
It is simply DUMB to think that Blizzard would even CONSIDER testing this encounter while on top of a lamp to see if that would exploit the encounter. Again this takes a direct and deliberate act on the part of Ensidias raid members.<br />
<br />
Hodir:<br />
<br />
Blizzard obviously didn't intend on you using the 'flower power' buff to beat the encounter, and obviously did not bother to see if this buff could be taken from Freyas conservatory to Hodirs room. Again, a deliberate and direct action on Ensidias part.<br />
<br />
Anub:<br />
<br />
Lets stun a boss! Obviously an intended mechanic!<br />
<br />
Arthas:<br />
<br />
During p3, the Valkyr come in and pick up a random player, carrying them to the edge and dropping them off. As such, you have to remain somewhat close to the center of the room to avoid being instantly carried off. Bombs are used when out of range of the dps target for the most part. You would under no conceivable circumstance toss a bomb at a no longer existing platform - especially when the player is already dead. On top of this, tons of raid members power leveled engineering, obviously a deliberate choice on their part. On top of this, almost no damage was done to the Valkyrs in their kill parse. It would take a fool to believe that they are innocent.</div></div><hr />

<br />
However due to the fact that they are unwilling to release a video and release in-depth combat logs, they're open to as much scrutiny as people can throw at them. If they want their name cleared, why not release some information, combat logs, a video, ANYTHING, about it? Are they afraid?<br />
<br />
I felt the same way during Exodus. They were caught red-handed, and whoever posted their news story had a complete meltdown, just like what happened with Muqq. They're both idiots.<br />
<br />
I don't follow anyone with blind faith. Ensidia's history is too shady to follow them without at least acknowledging that there might be a significant problem here. Given the fact that no guild has downed LK since Ensidia's encounter last night, shows something. The fight was much easier with the bomb mechanic than they're letting on.<br />
<br />
And please, the gap between Ensidia and the others isn't large enough that they're just &quot;that good.&quot; That's blind following.<br />
<br />
<br />
First of all, regardless of what you say there is bias, whether it be minimal or not there is always bias and there's no getting around that. It's just human nature, and to deny that there is any bias is all only shows a lack of knowledge on that matter.<br />
<br />
Again though, the primary issue at hand is people assuming they know what's going on when we don't have enough information to justify any real assumptions that anyone has made. You can argue they haven't released a video, however how do we know they even recorded one? Considering I've seen statements of them not caring about normal mode videos and only planning to release hard mode ones that wouldn't surprise me. Again I'm not saying they didn't record it, but simply assuming they're hiding the information by not releasing a video right now is just that, an assumption without any real logic to it. You could also generally assume that they could be rendering the video still, as it does take time to do and is why most kill videos are released the following day and not immediately after the kill. <br />
<br />
Lastly, the blind faith on Ensidia being so good and the only guild to have completed the encounter is also somewhat ridiculous considering the fact that the majority of guilds are still preparing for the encounter itself and are taking the necessary steps to ensure that they get it down this week as to have hard modes open to them next week. Just because no one else has downed it yet doesn't mean these guilds have even attempted it on their main characters in 25 man. <br />
<br />
So again, another assumption that doesn't prove or disprove anything, it's merely your opinion so stop trying to piece it together with your own logic, which regadless of what you say will have some bias to it, and trying to write it up as knowledge and fact when it's purely speculation.</div></div><hr />

Okay, I was kidding about that, but I'm surprised they didn't get a Perma ban for this AND the other shit they pulled before. I mean, if Overrated could get Permanent Bans for cheating, then so did Ensidia deserve such with their shoddy history of cheap tricks.<br />

<br />
What about a log, then? They already revealed that they have WoL files and in-depth data files, but the only one we know of MYSTERIOUSLY has 7 and some change minutes cut out of it. What was during those minutes? Val'kyr.<br />
<br />
There's been several raid leaders who have discussed what happens when the platform is removed, and there's a new Ensidia blog post saying that they were AWARE of what happened when the platform re-appeared. But they continued to do it without even a second thought.<br />
<br />
I do agree with bias. It's impossible to have a neutral standpoint, but I really enjoy Ensidia and what they've done to game progression. They have solid players. It's why it sucks so much to see them do this type of shit.<br />
<br />
There's what, like, 50 guilds or something that are 11/12 ICC 25 now? Correct me if I'm wrong, but if at least one of those guilds haven't had SERIOUS progression, then something is up. I find that hard to believe.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Over the next 72 hours, if no conclusive evidence points out obvious exploitation, the ban will end, and life will move on, maybe even an apology from blizzard, but in the end, this is all someone just doing their job as their superior has instructed them, you can't blame them for being cautious.<br />
<br />
If there is proof of knowingly and willfully exploiting, then by all means increase the punishment, or make it clear this won't be tolerated again.<br />
<br />
However, i have to point out, that Ensidia claiming world first when a bug obviously occured was EXTREAMLY stupid. The smart thing to do would have been to contact blizzard about it and stay quiet. would they have lost the world first? probably, but to risk such accusation and punishment over NORMAL 25 man wasn't the smoothest move on their part.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Phation</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">This ban is just a further failure on Blizzards part to make this game more and more geared towards the casual players and them not doing their job at testing encounters.<br />
<br />
How many patches has it been since we've had a boss encounter that actually works properly the first time? I'm saying somewhere in early BC but that could be wrong.<br />
<br />
Ensidia beat the fight, used the game mechanics they were given and came out world first. Isn't that how boss fights are supposed to work? How world firsts are supposed to work? How is it Ensidias's fault that Blizzard has a bunch of monkeys doing their coding for them?<br />
<br />
It's been common place for a while now for Rogues to use the bombs in their DPS rotations, there's more than enough information on EJ to support that and even more numbers of high end raiding rogues to. The fact that it just so happened to aid them on the encounters is Blizzards fault, not Ensidia's. The ban is bullshit.<br />
<br />
They didn't alter anything that wasn't in the encounter mechanics. As far as they knew it was part of the fight for the platforms to respawn. So banning them for a screw up on Blizzards end is a total cop out. I say give them world first, they earned it after all. <br />
<br />
Even in the old days of raiding we used outside influences to help ourselves kill a boss, I can remember our first Nef kill or Rag kill, we used every single buff we could get on us, that wasn't called cheating back in the day and neither should this. It was making use of the encounter they were given, nothing more.<br />
<br />
Blizzard, you screwed up, own up to it, admit you were wrong, fix what needs to be fixed and let Ensidia have another go at it at the very least.<br />
<br />
I'm no Ensidia fan-boy but I give credit where it's due, and in this case, good job Ensidia, you earned your world first loud and proud.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Ringthane</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 07:46 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Bergg this bug happened totally random on a few of the tries, it didn't even happen on all tries. Personally I'm not even sure that it was Saronite that caused it. I believe it was a bug in the encounter that caused it to happen, especially since the bombs did 0.000 siege damage. To me it just looks like that wanted a reason to ban us. If it actually was the saronites then there is no way in the universe that we could possibly have known that since they only did damage to the mobs Naihiko used them on. There was no extra damage on anything else. <br />
<br />
We got banned for raiding and that's it. <br />
<br />
On a side note. Every end boss in the game has had at least one bug since Vanilla for the first guilds reaching it. Onyxia, Ragnaros, Nefarion, C'thun, Kel'Thuzad, Gruul, Magtheridon, Vashj, Kael'Thas, Archimonde, Illidan, Kil'Jaden and the list continue all the way up to Arthas. <br />
<br />
Once again. Banned for raiding. <br />
<br />
<br />
Naaah, you didn't get banned for raiding.<br />
<br />
You got banned for cheating. You know it, we know it, and Blizzard knows it. <br />
<br />
If you're such a top guild, you should know that the first rule of raiding is, if you find a bug, you stop raiding and report it. You don't use it to cheat your way through and THEN report it. Now, you may be butthurt because you found the bug to begin with, but isn't that the price you pay for being so far out in front? Somebody has to find the bugs for the rest of us. And if your guild powerleveled engineering before the attempt, as some are saying, and then an engineering bug is hotfixed by Blizzard almost immediately after your attempt, what should that tell us? <br />
<br />
Face facts. You cheated and got caught. I don't care what you did in the past, I don't give a damn about your reputation. You broke the rules and you got caught, and you deserve the same punishment anyone else would get. Muqq's river of tears on his blog are just the icing on the cake. Hey, Muqq - don't let the door hit ya where the good Lord split ya.<br />

countless times you had no clue if they were exploiting. It just so funny to see people like you actually believing this BS they are writing.

The question is: Did they know the saronite bombs were the cause and if so, were the bombs thrown at the BOSS or at the fallen platforms?<br />
<br />
If boss: Unjustified bann, no doubt.<br />
<br />
If platform: Justified bann, good riddance.<br />
<br />
Now, let's all be honest here, would you HONESTLY stop attempting a boss, specially when you are going for World's First, if you knew there was something wrong with the encounter yet you had no idea what was causing it?<br />
<br />
I didn't think so.</div></div><hr />

Who really cares. Yes blizzard could inform them of the bug and then fix it. But why all the hate from blizz. So there encounter was bugged oh well. Fix it and let it go. I think they are just embarrassed. All that hype on the final boss and he is bugged from the get go.</div></div><hr />

Even going through raw combat logs wouldn't help because it looks like they only show Saronite Bomb damaging NPCs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Is that true though? Isn't the point of the bombs that they do SIEGE damage? Isn't the whole point of that class of damage in that it's environmentally destructive?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">sicness</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">What about a log, then? They already revealed that they have WoL files and in-depth data files, but the only one we know of MYSTERIOUSLY has 7 and some change minutes cut out of it. What was during those minutes? Val'kyr.<br />
<br />
There's been several raid leaders who have discussed what happens when the platform is removed, and there's a new Ensidia blog post saying that they were AWARE of what happened when the platform re-appeared. But they continued to do it without even a second thought.<br />
<br />
I do agree with bias. It's impossible to have a neutral standpoint, but I really enjoy Ensidia and what they've done to game progression. They have solid players. It's why it sucks so much to see them do this type of shit.<br />
<br />
There's what, like, 50 guilds or something that are 11/12 ICC 25 now? Correct me if I'm wrong, but if at least one of those guilds haven't had SERIOUS progression, then something is up. I find that hard to believe.<br />
<br />
<br />
I'll agree with you on a log would clear things up, but assuming that they're hiding the logs is again just an assumption and could be chalked up to anything from people not caring to them not wanting to from being upset with the ban they received and taking that 3 days to have a break from the game. You see how I can just write up whatever comes to mind about it and how it can make it seem like it's not necessarily a guilty move by them? That's the point, these are all assumptions without real evidence and shouldn't be lead into believing that it's any real evidence towards anything. <br />
<br />
With the other guilds doing the encounter, I'm sure most of them have attempted it in 10 man at the very least, but due to the competitive nature of these guilds they are extremely wary of posting ANY information on their status of the encounter so they don't unwillingly post information another guild could use to complete the encounter. The only obvious progress you'll see then from these guilds is when they've completed it and nothing more. They've done this in the past and will continue to do so as to not give out useful information to their competitors.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">georgezimmer</div><div class="date">2010-02-04, 07:50 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Well, Exodus also had the option of not taking advantage of Blizzard's slip-up there, but decided to exploit it nonetheless.<br />
<br />
Umm, so did Ensidia? Throwing Saronite bombs away from the boss doesn't actually add DPS...They knew what it was causing, and they continued to exploit it. How is this any different?</div></div><hr />

Because Naihiko died. Go watch the movie and tell me what happens at 10%. Thats right, everyone gets ressed, that's why there's 1 grenade out of place. Maybe you should consider different careers than analysts, because you really suck at that.</div></div><hr />

I really hope you are trolling if not here is an explanation how they did it : they hired a gypsy fortune teller that told about arthas and that he has a bug with saronite bombs.<br />
<br />
<br />
Nah, I'd say it was a divine &quot;vision&quot; from a so-called deity named &quot;God&quot;.</div></div><hr />

Fix your goddamn buggy bullshit half-assed encounters. The amount of time we dedicated to get our keys to see this guy die and take a turn at the Emperor is just sick. To finally see Blood die only to have the ENTIRE raid DT'd from anywhere in the room was simply an insult. Blood dies, there are two earrings on the corpse, yet no matter where you are in the room, the Emperor DT's. So congrats rot on those. It's cheap enough to make a mob DT in the first place. But to have his agro radius extend to the entire room is ridiculous. So let me get this straight -- and this is how you guys envisioned this in San Diego: You spend months farming keys to get up to the room. Months farming Shissar Bane weapons (and the recipe is where?). You kill Blood while dealing with 8 other snakes in the room. And immediately after that fight you're supposed to engage the DEATHTOUCHING-FROM-ANYWHERE-IN-THE-ROOM Emperor along with the 8 snakes? Whoever came up with this sheer *fisting* of an encounter can go fuck themselves. Do me a favor so I don't waste my guild's time on this kind of jackass shit-fest again, send me an email at tigole@legacyofsteel.net when you decide to A) Implement an encounter that wasn't designed by a retarded chimp chained to a cubicle B) Get a Quality Assuarance Department C) Actually beta test the fucking thing and D) Patch it live. And please for god's sake -- do it in the order I laid out for you. Don't worry, I won't charge you a consulting fee on that one. And for good luck you might as well E) Pull your heads out of your asses. While you're at it rename the game to BetaQuest since you've used up you're alotted false advertising karma on the Bazaar and user interface scam of '01.<br />
<br />
Fix the Emperor encounter. Fix Seru. Rethink your time-sink bullshit. Fix all the buggy motherfucking ring encounters (I suggest you let whoever made the Burrower one do this since that dude apparently laid off the crack the rest of you were smoking). Fix the VT key quest. Fix VT (just guessing it's fucked up considering your track record). Don't have the resources to fix this stuff? Move the ENTIRE Planes of Power team over to fixing Shadows of Luclin AND DO IT NOW. If you don't fix Luclin, you jackassess will be the only ones playing the Planes of Power.<br />

The enchant from engineering that gives a use to hands ability that grants haste every minute is pretty much the best profession enchant in the game for every dps class.</div></div><hr />

The wording of your post made it look like Exodus was innocent compared to Ensidia's situation, in which they were both on the same level. Both sides discovered such an exploit, had the option to not exploit it, but they still did.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You arn't going to find every bug and make a fight perfect. The point now is Enisida admitted they knew something was wrong with their encounter. Figured out that when the platform glitches, they can ignore the Valkyries.<br />
<br />
That is an exploit of boss mechanics. There is no other way to justify yourself anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The logs were released earlier today. Why not release the entire thing unless you have something to hide?<br />
<br />
I'm not making up stories as to why they can or can't show the logs, I'm simply making observations.<br />
<br />
The fact of the matter is this:<br />
<br />
Lich King calls 3 Val'kyr's. I'm assuming they have anywhere from 500k to 2 million health.<br />
<br />
Now, by completely ignoring the Val'kyr, that's 1.5-6 million damage inflicted on Lich King that should've went to the Val'kyr. Know what I'm getting at?</div></div><hr />
