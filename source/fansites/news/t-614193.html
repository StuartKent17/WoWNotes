Rogues, one-handed dual-wield Warriors, and Hunters (lol) don't suffer the same penalty, do we?</div></div><hr />

<br />
When dual wielding, both weapons incur the 24% missrate penalty, meaning all white attacks, not just those from your offhand. As it currently stands, yellow attacks bypass this, using what you seem to think is the main hand missrate.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Dual wielding any weapon also results in an increased miss chance. Dual-wielding increases the base miss rate by 19%, compared to 5% for wielding a single weapon. The talents Dual Wield Specialization and Nature's Guidance for shaman, Surefooted for Hunters, and Precision for rogues and warriors increases the chance to hit with both weapons while dual wielding. <br />

Your Last Stand/Adrenaline Rush equivalent has a cooldown to match the talents it copies? Well that's a shame right there.

&quot;Shield of Righteousness now deals holy damage equal to 240% of your block value. (Up from 200%)&quot;<br />

<br />
And Ret pallies... lol... dmg nerf on seals, less pve+pvp talents (pvp effects are on pvp talents only and pve effects on pve talents), some mana regen &quot;band-aids&quot; on benediction and JotW and old Art of War, somehow, back.<br />

It may be a PvE buff, but it most certainly not a PVP buff. Feral needed serious help in PVP (arenas especially) and that change has seriously hurt any hope of improvement. You view it as a Last Stand/Adrenaline Rush equivalent, but many other players view it as a Beastial Wrath equivalent. It may be that they are trying to do too much with one talent to satisfy pve tanks, pve dps, and pvp dps. I understand that with all the buffs and a 3 minute cooldown it could be considered a bit OP'd to have the cc immunity, but some of us would have preferred some of the other features of this talent were reduced/removed instead.</div></div><hr />

Ok so shadowform gives a constant spell interrupt prevention mechanic that's nice for PVE. However nerfing Misery, Twisted Faith, Dispersion, as well as nerfing Shadow Power down to 10% (wasn't it more still in earlier builds?) crit.<br />
<br />
I seriously hope there's some internal tweaking to our specials coefficients or is this just a preemptive nerf before the big mind flay change? Honestly we were red headed stepchilds for dps and brought for our mana regen in TBC...this doesn't reassure me that my damage will be significantly increased.</div></div><hr />

I mean frost strike now wins the crappiest attack award with 30% weapons damage+99. I mean that is very little damage for a 41 point talent and it costs alot of rune power aswell. I agree with whoever said they seem to push death knights into being completely useless. I don't think iäve seen a single pvp video where death knights actually beats any other class in months now. They should have changed the mitigation between frost strike and some talents instead of ruining the attack itself.<br />
<br />
Ok now to check other changes aswell. Oh titans grip nerf was a rather big one imo.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">mpohagan</div><div class="date">2008-09-11, 06:57 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">Re: divine plea change - restores x% of base mana over 10 seconds, during which period healing effectiveness is reduced by 50%. Seems pretty stupid to me. If we need to regen mana and don't really need to heal, we might as well go drink (assuming a pet isn't keeping us in combat). Healing at 50% efficiency is mana inefficient; doing so for the purpose of regenerating mana doesn't make much sense. I'm just curious as to how often we won't have pressure on us to heal (a substantial amount at least) for 10secs in wotlk. Anyone else not like the sound of this change?<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Same old whines and qq. No one is asking you to buy wotlk. <br />
If you do not like it just don't buy it. Warhammer here I come is old now. Get over it.<br />
<br />
<br />
And the &quot;no one is asking you to buy wotlk&quot; is getting pretty old too. After 2 years of my class sucking, I don't want that element of tbc to be repeated with wotlk. And the changes throughout beta so far do look a bit ominous. The people saying these things are pissed off for a reason; its probably in your best interests too that the classes be in a state that they are happy with :)</div></div><hr />

It's been nothing but a non-stop buff-fest for Prot and Ret since TBC came out, and nothing but nerfs and half-hearted attempts to bandaid massive, glaring, crippling issues with Holy. And wow, Wrath is going to be absolutely no different.<br />
<br />
No new heals. Nerfed abilities still nerfed. Half-hearted attempts at new Holy mechanics (oooh, I get spell haste when I judge, cause, yanno, I'll be judging all the time when raid healing.) <br />
<br />
Now they go and completely screw over what would have been an awesome healing build by shoving Sheath of Light so far down into Ret that it's completely inaccessible now. I love how that's Blizzard's new answer for talents that are popular with another tree. They just put it completely out of reach, just like they did to Warriors.<br />
<br />
Sheath of Light was going to be absolutely amazing, and a much needed addition to a class that hasn't gotten a single new healing spell since the end of WoW Classic. But now, Blizzard has destroyed that. GG Blizz. You have absolutely no clue anymore.</div></div><hr />

<br />
The change listing has:<br />
<br />
&quot;damage you deal with one handed weapons&quot;<br />
<br />
As opposed to the updated(?) talent calc showing:<br />
<br />
&quot;all damage you deal when a one-handed weapon is equipped&quot;<br />
<br />
If they took it to weapon-damage only, that's another negative tweak to prot output, unless weapon damage alone is now overtaking all other reactive and shield-based damage to such a degree as to warrant this adjustment.</div></div><hr />

Edit: When toying around with the talent calculator I found that 38/0/33 would give me most of the good stuff in holy and also:<br />
Judgements of the Wise moved from Tier 6 to Tier 7 and now your Judgement spells have a 33/66/100% chance to grant the Replenishment effect to up to 10 party or raid members mana regeneration equal to 0.5% of their maximum mana per second, and to immediately grant you 20% of your maximum mana.<br />

Yes, and his point was that you now need 24% hit even for yellow attacks if you spec Titan's Grip.<br />
<br />
Leather gear may have agility, but it seems like the only option if you want to reach the hit cap.</div></div><hr />

The rollup of Spell Warding/Guarded by the Light and Redoubt/Shield Spec are certainly a nice touch. As hard as it is to swallow, I actually found it NECESSARY to take a few points in Imp. BoK to get further down in the tree, without taking something MORE useless. A four point talent for something like that seems terribly useless, though, when 2 would be just fine, IMHO. The thing that really pees in my cheerios, though, is the removal of Imp. Holy Shield. I know they buffed the number of charges, but that's a huge nerf to reactive threat.EDIT: After I looked at the talent tree a bit harder, I realized that I was, in fact, retarded. The damage from the new Holy Shield is listed at 211, where the previous version is listed at 150+20%(30)=180. So yeah, as you can see, this is hands down better. Also, the change of the position in Deflection/Imp. BoM is great.<br />
<br />
The only question I have is, where are the &quot;cool&quot; abilities they were talking about in the last blue post? Yeah, we got the reorganization, but at the same time, they skipped right over the nerf bat, and went straight to the nerf sledgehammer. Maybe you can give us a mint to get this bitter taste out of our mouths? ;-)</div></div><hr />

Well that's a shame right there.

Damn shame you get a fear-immunity rolled into 30% more health, with a (big long) 5 minute cooldown.<br />
<br />
<br />
Yeah, and Last Stand is a tier three talent, not the 51 point last talent in the tree, but you're right to be snide about the change, because those things are completely equal, aren't they?<br />
And again you are right when you say that a 51 point talent should be equal to a stance change.</div></div><hr />

lol i think almost all classes got nerfed. Blizzard can better start with very bad skills/talents/mechanics and then upgrade them instead of the other way around. This is disappointing for everyone.<br />
<br />
Shamans had Spectral Transformation that is gonna be removed, Thunderstorm got nerfed twice and also the restoration tree got nerfed while there aren't even new ranks available and windfury is not working.<br />
<br />
There are ofcourse good reasons why this is all changing, but it's still disappointing when you think you get a nice skill or talent and it gets removed or changed so much. :)<br />

<br />
* Aspect of the Beast has been removed -- Not a painful nerf as the only time I ever used this was the rare occasion I'm trying to hide while carrying the flag in WSG, but a nerf none the less<br />
<br />
<br />
* Kill Shot now deals 200% weapon damage plus [30% of RAP + 400] damage. (Old - Weapon damage plus [15% of RAP + 2500] damage) Take a hunter with a 250-450 bow (so assume damage 350) and with 2500RAP the old formula would give you a kill shot of 3225, the new formula gives you a kill shot of 1850<br />
<br />
<br />
* Cobra Strikes now affects your pet's next 2 special attacks. (Down from 3) umm a nerf<br />
<br />
* Invigoration now has a 50/100% to instantly regenerate 1% mana when your pet scores a critical hit with a special ability. (Old - 100% chance to regenerate 1/2% mana) umm another one<br />
<br />
* Aspect Mastery now reduces the damage down to you while Aspect of the Monkey is active by 5% (down from 10%) and increases the attack power bonus of Aspect of the Hawk by 30% (down from 50%) and another<br />
<br />
* Improved Steady show now has a chance to reduce the mana cost of your next Aimed / Arcane / Chimera shot by 20%. (Down from 40%) another :(<br />
<br />
* Lock and Load now affects your next Arcane Shot (down from 3 next Arcane Shot). wow another<br />
<br />
* T.N.T now increases the critical strike chance of your Explosive Shot and Explosive Trap by 3/6/9%. (Down from 5/10/15%) And ffs another...<br />

Dual wielding two handed weapons does not magically double your DPS. The old Titan's Grip was fine, fury warriors were somewhere in the middle of the DPS charts which is actually lower than they were in TBC.

by that time it could be late, there were several broken specs in wotlk not usefull for pvp, nor pve or they didnt scale past t4/t5 content, and if feedback is not provided (not massive QQ, granted) then it can take similar way once again, wneh its shipped, Blizz wont fix problems of few specs which would need overhaul, because they will be too busy to fix hunfreds of bugs and preparing new content for next patches</div></div><hr />
