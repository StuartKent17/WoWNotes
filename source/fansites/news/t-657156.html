Blue posts<br />
Passive Talents<br />
We agree with this to a degree. We have put a lot of passive increases in for a few reasons, including:<br />
<br />
1) It's the main way for hybrids to distinguish themselves (otherwise Elemental heals as well as Resto).<br />
2) They are popular in a wide variety of situations (other than &quot;Oh that's a PvP talent.&quot;)<br />
3) They are no-brainers, which to be honest, a game as complex as WoW could stand to have a little of.<br />
4) They are very easy ways to tweak healing, damage or tanking when a particular spec is underperforming or overpowered.<br />
<br />
But while all those are laudable goals, in the end we're not sure it's worth it. We wonder if the talent trees would all be more interesting with fewer passives and more interesting talents. Consider that even the situational talents wouldn't feel so expensive if they weren't competing against a 5% damage talent. Cherry picking talents in another tree wouldn't be so scary either since you wouldn't be sacrificing pure dps etc. to do it.<br />
<br />
I'd actually look at the warrior Prot tree again, especially comparing it to the BC version. There are still several passive talents, but we combined many of them and got rid of really lame ones like Defiance (+ threat). We have ambitious plans to get more talent trees in that vein.

Balance druids / Frost mages comparison<br />
I think the Frost mage to Balance druid comparison is very relevant. We don't want to have to give every caster (or every class) all of the mage tools in order to make them PvP viable. The problem is that &quot;PvP viable&quot; has become so synonymous with &quot;Good at Arena 2s.&quot; We are taking steps to deemphasize that as the only way to play PvP in WoW in 3.2, and we're prepared to take more.<br />
<br />
When I say &quot;we tend to take a longer view&quot; it has more to do with what we want PvP in WoW to be and not about giving Balance druids Ice Block and Blink.<br />
<br />
There is an old-school alternative, which is that every class gets 1 PvP spec (say Resto for druids, Frost for mages and Arms for warriors) and using the others would be akin to using a Balance spec to tank. We don't think that solution is as fun, but it does make the game a lot easier to balance, and for some players that is a big chunk of their having fun. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18326619729-moonkin-we-tend-to-take-a-longer-view.html))<br />
<br />
Balance druids PvE rotation<br />
Do Frost Mages spam nothing but Frost Bolts? Actually, no. They certainly use a lot of them, but the class is designed to do that. They still use other spells and the best mages know when to use those other spells. Even in PvP.<br />
<br />
With Balance druids, it's different. They have two nukes, and one really doesn't influence the other much. (You get a little bit of interest in PvP from their being in two different schools.) Most Balance druids worth their salt can look at Starfire or Wrath and know which one to cast and which one to ignore. Eclipse did help that situation somewhat, but it hasn't been as succesful as Brain Freeze, and I'm not sure it can be as long as there are two similar nukes. Brain Freeze works because it entices you to use a spell you otherwise have little interest in casting. But we also don't want to stampede for that solution every time we want to get players to cast a second spell.

<br />
Feral DPS Rotation<br />
The Feral dps rotation is complex because we like it that way. We understand it’s harder to pull off that rotation in PvP. However, this is somewhat compensated for the fact that Shred is a very high damage ability (perhaps even the highest single button melee attack) even when not propped up with Savage Roar, Rake, Mangle etc, and even when you can’t use Shred, you do have a back-up ability, Mangle, that trades damage for ease-of-use. Honestly, I don’t think any problems Feral has in PvP comes from not doing enough damage. In PvP it nearly always comes down to when you can do that damage and countering specific tactics of the other team. In fact when we compensate classes with limited utility by just piling on more damage, we get into trouble. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/28/18360843398-shred-spam-dps-in-pvp.html))<br />

Rogue survivability and crowd control<br />
<br />
TBH, I tend to think the rogue class would benefit from being a little more tanky. Many of the balance problems we have had with them in PvP (though it affects the solo PvE experience too) comes from the basic design being that when you don't have your target CC'd, they really mess you up. That puts a ton of pressure on the CC to be potent, which in turn drives a lot of PvP balance with regard to diminishing returns and dispels.<br />
<br />
I'm not saying we'd pull crowd control from rogues. I'm just saying we wish they weren't so reliant on it. Now that in turn does have the risk that if they were too reliant on dodge for survival that we'd be in a similar situation as with the tanks -- dodge, dodge, dodge, splat.

Shield Slam in PvP<br />
My point was that Prot warriors doing 19K Shield Slams in PvP is unacceptable. Some players are saying &quot;Buff Shield Slam. I don't care if it breaks PvP.&quot; We do. If we made Shield Slam overall hit for more damage, we would have to lower its damage but increase its frequency so that it isn't bursty. It needs to be a little bursty to do its job for snap aggro, but it can't be so bursty that it one-shots another player. This is why we keep going back to high threat -- it can help with snap aggro without hitting for silly numbers. Make sense? <br />
<br />
[...] As many other players have pointed out in this and other threads “I can one shot other players sometimes if the stars align” is still not acceptable. Hitting for big numbers when all of your cooldowns and trinkets line up is fine. Hitting for 15K or 19K or whatever as a tanking class is not. Other players are worried about that risk and we are worried about that risk. That is why I said we’d like to improve Prot warrior damage, but are unlikely to do it through Shield Slam. We have already increased Prot warrior damage some and we’re waiting for more PTR tests to see if we want to improve it some more.

The problem with balance atm, is that it is now an RNG burst damage class. What this means is that we are relying on proc to gain the most out of our damage. <br />
<br />
the problem, as Ulduar has clearly shown, is that movement pretty much negates an Eclipse rotation. you rarely get a chance to take full advantage of eclipse, and with some fights, you get only around 3 casts during that 15 second interval. Movevment can e considered pretty much anything that stops you from casting. thus Ignis with the pop up, phase 3 on yogg where you turn around for 5+ seconds, etc...</div></div><hr />

Check your Connection Info.<br />
<br />
Is just the direct HTTP connection or is it the torrenters ?<br />
<br />
Either way either theres too many people downloading it via HTTP or there isn't enough people with a full copy of it offering it with a decent enough upload speed to matter (IE Not enough seeds).<br />
<br />
Are you having problems with normal torrents ? Opening up ports in your firewall and NAT nat an all dat jazz ? Set your upload speed at a decent speed ?<br />
<br />
Think we need more people (ie non wow players or wow players away from the wow install) with the torrent file open in a torrent client downloading :D<br />

<br />
While i agree that 10k+ and over shield slam are totally unacceptable and needed a nerf, there already IS a tanking class which can hit that hard but strangely, this one will only get minor tweaks in 3.2.<br />
<br />
Yeah, you guessed it, i'm looking at DKs...<br />
<br />
I recently got hit for &quot;over nine thousand&quot; in stance def AND 963 resilience, just probably had an imp KS debuff.<br />

<br />
Yeah, without res and stance def, this means about more than 12k SS...<br />
<br />
This is not a personnal QQ, just a straight fact: Prot warriors are doing abnormal damage, they immediatly nerf it to the ground. Still; i'm fine with it, it had to be done.<br />
DKs are doing insane damage since 3.0? &quot;Oh, we'll see, we are still not sure the are are grossly overpowered&quot; ... and then SS will hit almost as hard in 3.2, espacially with the last tier weapons.<br />
<br />
I wonder why GC never made any comment about SS and FS damage?</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Grizzer</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 08:54 AM</div></div><div class="posttext">We wonder if the talent trees would all be more interesting with fewer passives and more interesting talents.<br />
Agreed, they would! Blizz has mentioned before that from a design perspective they're interested more in people making challenging decisions, whether that be about a spec or a rotation. As a player, I agree. Although I think the respec cost should be brought down, test-driving different talent builds and figuring out what works best FOR ME (not just what EJ says does) is a very rewarding experience.<br />
<br />
The problem is that &quot;PvP viable&quot; has become so synonymous with &quot;Good at Arena 2s.&quot; We are taking steps to deemphasize that as the only way to play PvP in WoW in 3.2, and we're prepared to take more.<br />
<br />
This is a good line of thought, but the only &quot;PvP viable&quot; experience I've had as a Boomkin is if it is an AV turtle or if I have a dedicated healer... or if no other class is attacking me other than another Boomkin.<br />
<br />
When I say &quot;we tend to take a longer view&quot; it has more to do with what we want PvP in WoW to be and not about giving Balance druids Ice Block and Blink.<br />
<br />
I don't want Ice Block and Blink, but can we have something? I have suggestions here:<br />

Im a dk and I can see your concern with this. SS is a special attack. Its shadow dmg, not physical. That being said it can be partially resisted every time its used. If you look at your combat log again you will see that you didnt resist any of the attack an that is what resulted in such a high crit. SS and FS both are magical dmg and are subject to resistance, that is why you see PvP DKs geeming spell pen an not just STR or STAM.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Either remove PvP entirely, or do something similar to Guild Wars. I'm not a PvPer in the slightest, so I get steamrollered if I find myself in a PvP situation (also comes with being a Holy Priest). But I can see it's starting to split the player base more and more.<br />

<br />
While i understand your arguments, this still changes nothing to the fact that a tanking class with heavy defensives CDs can land a straight 12k on any armor type target.<br />
<br />
Concerning the fact SS is shadow damage, yup, you have to gem spell pen to a minimum of 140 but remember the upside is that you completely ignore your target's armor. Believe me; i would trade any day my physical damage to magical, even if i had to gem for spell pen, you probably would too if you got crit for 2k5 on plate armor.<br />
<br />
But once again, this is not even the subject; the thing is a tanking class can hit more than 10k on any target, regardless of armor value and i can't understand why this is not adressed while shield slam is immediatly being nerfed once it begins to shine.</div></div><hr />

Please think before posting. We need a solution to stop this stupid situation between pve and pvp.<br />

Having a viable tree spec for pvp for each class would be a start.<br />

<br />
Dude, is it for real that a bubbled paladin (divine shield) can burst you down with -50% dmg? Looks like the unskilled faceroller isn't the paladin...<br />
<br />
A ranged class complaining about not having melee abilities and saying they're owned by a melee class without ranged abilities (and ways to keep you on melee other than 1min/40s talented stun that any faceroller can trinket out) that is onwed any day by ranged classes... Guess the game is ok. Ranged specialized class beeing owned by melee WHEN IN MELEE and vice-versa.<br />
<br />
I play a warrior, but finished leveling my ret paladin a while ago and really see how &quot;unskilled&quot; ret is, because instead of 112, they press 1234. Just doing it easy, not taking into account CCs. Anyway, I can see people that I fight against in wintergrasp comming here and complaining, because it's really stupid when you just go and get them off guard. They're fighting someone else, burning their CDs and I come and finish them with my CDs. I do think they're there thinking &quot;damn OP ret pally! They should be nerfed!&quot;. Or when I finish off a healer, that is alread with a rogue and warrior burning him down (or even more, he's outnumbered), with hammer of wrath. He'll probably say &quot;F#@% retlols! NERF!&quot;.<br />
<br />
A few days ago, I dueled a prot warrior, altough he was somehow good with that spec (using disarm everytime he could, stuns, charges, etc...), I can't see myself as a &quot;unskilled 1234 player&quot; when I dodge (not the avoidance stat!) his shockwaves or use sacred shield to diminsh his charge/proc stuns, dmg and to try to lure the warrior to waste his Shattering Throw (and he actually bought that, NOW I can use my bubble when I need instead of just beeing a faceroller and not aware that my oponent can remove it). Skill comes from other stuff and not only from what order you use your attacks.<br />
<br />
Guess it's worse when a player with a very capable class (with good tools to use) just sit there instead, beeing totally ignorant about their oponent just blaming on a suposed &quot;OP status&quot; when he should learning how do counter that specific class. GC alread said that skilled players own ret paladins any day. <br />
<br />
Remember that on games like wow you probably have a class/spec that will own you no matter what, the same way your class/spec will own someone else. Why? Because it's a game to play in groups, so when you reach that &quot;owned&quot; situation, you'll have partners to cover your weakness. But people just want to own everyone even on this kind of game.</div></div><hr />

<br />
They don't burst me down, but they do take my health down.<br />
<br />
The problem, Vanish, is that hunters find it impossible to stay in rage, and maybe you'd know that if you played a hunt.<br />
<br />
Vs a warrior, I get charged, wing clipped, and stunned. If I use disengage and drop a trap, most of the time my useless traps get resisted and I'm back in range because the warrior charged me again after switching to beserker stance. Paladins find a way to keep me stunned, even if I pop my trinket. Rogues aren't as much of a problem, but I can't get out of ranged if I'm stunned, and if I escape out of that, I have crippling poison on. I attack them, they cloak of shadows and vanish after I disengage, and wind up behind me again.<br />
<br />
So yes, hunters are easy to kill in melee, but the problem is that it's impossible for us to stay in range and we're sitting ducks. Ghostcrawler has admitted that Blizzard is very unhappy with the way hunters are at the moment, and there's a REASON behind that, not just because hunters need to L2P. Keep in mind I have a full PvP set, fully gemmed, and 600 resilience just for battlegrounds, and it doesn't make a difference against melee. We have a million gimmicky skills, and not much that saves our ass. Hunters are easy to kill to basically any class, and it should not be that way.<br />
<br />
And paladins are overpowered, and there's no way you can argue otherwise. With bubble, their incredible bursts, heals, wearing plate, AND having stuns, you know it's instant death for us. Not to mention in battlegrounds they have lay on hands, so there goes any hopes I had of winning.<br />
<br />
TL;DR Paladins are in denial if they think they're balanced, even WITH the recent minor nerfs.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Vrillon</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 03:07 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">Because, to quote Ghostcrawler, &quot;it would feel like you were playing two different games&quot;.<br />

Too bad 99% of the community WANTS THAT.<br />

sooner or later people is going to learn, maybe blizzard will learn in 2 years from now that Ghostcrawler is the biggest idiot walking the planet right now.<br />
<br />
He makes Kalgan look intelligent and to the point things would be better to have him back.<br />
<br />
I hope Blizz is not planning to release 3.2 within the next month or so, that would indicate the end of Arena season which seems like it just got started.<br />
<br />
The problem with blizzard is they dont give people time to do shit, they release other crap in which you need to pick up on that and put down the other stuff.</div></div><hr />

For example a DK's frost strike in pve would keep the can't be dodged,parried effect, but obviously in pvp this leads to some nasty unavoidable hits. So for pvp talent trees lower the damage and take off the unavoidable part. <br />

<br />
What I been suggesting for about 2 years is to have 2 talent specs, one PVE and one PVP.<br />
<br />
BUT! To have 2 tabs or more of gear, 1 tab would consist of PVP gear not to be used in PVE gear tab, and you can see what I am suggesting.<br />
<br />
I think Vanguard had a similar setup, but Blizzard likes to ignore any good suggestion and listen to bad ones, look who they hire to work on crap, its people who were failures in previous games.</div></div><hr />
<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">Dessan</div><div class="date">2009-07-16, 04:17 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">and i am an angry mage, a blance druid should not have the same convenient spell that of a mage. the big advantage of a druid is to be able to cover every role in the same time, even if he's not spec for it he still has efffiency to cover it. if an hybrid spec can equal a pure without using any of his hybrid fonction, that's screwed up<br />
<br />
<br />
Eugh... &gt;.&lt; Yeah cuz a resto drood can just pop to cat form and do great damage can't they?<br />
<br />
They do NOT have the efficiency to cover multiple roles apart from maybe balance doing a tad off healing, but that requires shifting out of moonkin, which means taking heavy damage.<br />
<br />
So yeah. We can't simply cover all 3 specs like that.<br />
<br />
Imo Balance druids need a nice CC a bit like the Dk one where it chains and slows enemies with X range and then slows them for Y seconds. Nice and easy give it a biggish CD so it's like a CD you can really pop when things get a bit troublesome.<br />
<br />
Then give us a nice Channeled spell which does extra damage with a Dot applied. IS + More insect like a big insect LASER BEAM!<br />
<br />
A bit more CC for those OH SHIT! Moments. And then a nice bit of damage to avoid our RNG crap, and spamming wrath just uses too much mana and it gets rather boring.<br />
<br />
Making our PvP prio list:<br />
<br />
DoT - Channeled spell - Wrath til the DoT needs reapplying<br />
<br />
repeat adding CC and a SF everytime you need to give a spot of bigger damage, say your enemy is CC'd and you can blast of 2 SF's before they're free again.<br />
<br />
Defo make it more interesting for me. Atm I play resto in Arena just so I can actually do something.</div></div><hr />
