Orgrimmar - Gamon Updated!<br />
Gamon received a considerable upgrade in the latest beta build, he is now a level 85 elite and will kick your ass if you try to attack him! It's about time!<br />

Cataclysm Models - Al'akir and Druid Worgen Flight Form<br />
Apparently I forgot to post these models a while back and I couldn't miss an occasion to prove that complaining works! (http://www.mmo-champion.com/threads/788194-Missing-Models). Below is the in-game model of Al'akir (http://www.wowpedia.org/Al%27akir) and the flight form of worgen druids.<br />

All raids open for testing on Beta Servers<br />
I've opened up access to all the Cataclysm raid content on each of the four beta servers again.<br />

Both normal and heroic difficulties are available. <br />

Player vs. Player<br />
Hitting Higher Level Players<br />
Actually, it's already substantially easier to hit a higher level player in PvP than it is to hit an NPC of the equivalent level; though perhaps not to the extent you had in mind. On the same token, PvP is only really intended to be a reasonable challenge between characters that are within a few levels of each other.<br />
<br />
Gaining levels should confer power, and it's not at all untoward for a higher level character to have a significant advantage over a much lower level character. If one wants to beat a higher level player in PvP, then it's in their best interest to gear up, study up, and deliver a satisfying beat down once they catch up.

Zealotry<br />
Zealotry (in Cataclysm) does not consume Holy Power and is not on the GCD.<br />
<br />
This seems to be a common misperception, probably because this is a change from how it works on live, so I wanted to clear it up and maybe nudge the theorycrafting towards some more accurate numbers. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/129673/suggestion-for-zealotry-change))<br />

Recent Discipline changes on Beta<br />
The intent was that with the new PW:Barrier and a very strong Prayer of Healing, Disc would be good at group healing, and buffing Grace would make sure they can deliver the throughput on a single target, since they can't layer as many multiple spells on the same target the way a druid can.<br />
<br />
We're still looking at priest base heals though (Heal, Flash Heal, Greater Heal) because we're concerned neither Disc nor Holy is using them enough. If we end up buffing those then both Disc and Holy will be even stronger on single targets. (Source (http://blue.mmo-champion.com/topic/129528/disc-priest-changes-build-13277---yeah-baby))<br />

Agreed. <br />
<br />
It'd be nice to see how the new raid markers work on targets too, as a tank it's always annoying to have to tell people which target to kill even though there's a skull above their head. Now we can say 'OMG CANT YOU SEE THAT HUGE GLOWY BOUNCING SKULL!?' instead.<br />

I assume you'd have the same option to select a target or to put a marker on the floor seeing as heaps of strategies revolves around &quot;when boss does &lt;attack&gt; move to triangle&quot;, the rest would be the same. Kill skull&gt;X&gt;triangle</div></div><hr />

<br />
Heathen! But seriously, he's an NPC in Org for the Rogue pickpocket quest. So that he functioned properly for the quest he had to be made neutral (since you can't pickpocket friendlies)...which led to him being killed on sight any chance anyone got. And then the &quot;poor Gamon&quot; memes flowed...he probably has died more than any other NPC...<br />
<br />
Also for bonus points, you could kite him to the Caverns of Time: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvwycETPDDc&amp;feature=related</div></div><hr />

Must have a truckload of invisible armor.<br />
<br />
Also according to Wowhead the lvl10 Rogue quest, which involves pick pocketing Gamon to obtain a key is still around in Cataclysm.<br />

<br />
and seriously, with all the aoe spells now, both boss effects and player effects, does anyone think adding more colors on top of more colors is actually a good thing?<br />
<br />
Well, I don't think they had a problem with marking for places to stand pre-fight, you can do that now anyway with flares, Demonic Circles, Elune Stones et cetera. I think they had problems with the mod because it did it automatically, live, reacting to what was happening on the fly.</div></div><hr />

It'd be nice to see how the new raid markers work on targets too, as a tank it's always annoying to have to tell people which target to kill even though there's a skull above their head. Now we can say 'OMG CANT YOU SEE THAT HUGE GLOWY BOUNCING SKULL!?' instead.<br />

Actually, he doesn't. The char who hit him was certainly naked (which is why it had relatively low hp) and without weapons (hence the &quot;low&quot; damage), which accounts for the massive damage suffered (zero armor - litterally, since you no longer get any from AGI)</div></div><hr />

<br />
If you can no longer do this because you are forced to place a highlighting circle, then raid icons just become glorified flares with no way of marking a moving target or adding marks in a macro or addon. You can bet your ass geeks will be lining up to do everything in their power to find a way to put back the original function.<br />
<br />
Anyone on beta know how these raid icons actually work with targets, please? It's quite important since at the moment there is no way to duplicate this functionality via addons without breaking Blizzard's rules on addons, afaik.</div></div><hr />

We felt that overall, it created too many logistical issues for players and that in the long run, most players would just skip that week in the rotation. <br />
<br />
Thanks for all the feedback on this issue, we are listening.<br />
<br />
<br />
Here we go again....are you really sure you put a lot of thought into this? <br />
<br />
The Back Story: <br />
<br />
Rated BG's can also provide, over and above PvP points, Guild Experience points if the team meets the 80% guild member requirement. <br />
<br />
Apparently the Rated BG system will rotate on a weekly basis and was to offer 10 man BG's one week, 15 man the 2nd week and 25 man in the 3rd week and rinse and repeat. <br />
<br />
As a result of QQ by smaller guilds, who were upset they wouldn't be able to meet the 80% guild membership requirement and thus not earn Guild Experience points in the week 25 man BG's were offered, Blizzard has decided to eliminate the 25 vs 25 bracket all together. <br />
<br />
So, let's see how this contradicts Blizzard's own philosophy. First, they have repeatedly stated that the justification for 10 man PVE content dropping the same loot as 25 man is so players can choose the format they prefer to play regardless of reward. But apparently those that prefer larger guilds and epic PvP battles don't deserve that same consideration. <br />
<br />
Blizzard has also justified the Guild reward system by saying its not a game breaker which puts non-guilded players at a distinct disadvantage and the fact that larger guilds will earn rewards faster is justifiable. <br />
<br />
But, the fact that larger guilds would have earned more PvP related Guild Experience points apparently isn't acceptable. <br />
<br />
So now, because of a non game breaking reward (guild experience) a complete bracket of PvP, which many prefer, is being totally eliminated to accommodate smaller guilds. Next thing you know they won't bother producing 25 man Raids anymore either because that is the logical extension of this rationalization. <br />
<br />
There are a myriad of more thoughtful ways this issue could have been handled. As others have suggested, elsewhere, the &quot;rotation&quot; system of Rated BG's was the real issue. Instead of eliminating the 25 vs 25 bracket they could have eliminated the rotation and allowed groups to join the BG size (10, 15, 25) they preferred to play. There are other ways around the issue as well. <br />
<br />
But being logical and consistent are not strong suits of Blizzard.</div></div><hr />

4 pages of replies and only 1 person so far is talking about the removal of 25v25 rated bg bracket. I agree Sensa, them removing this is really stupid. When I 1st read about rated bg's I was expecting 40vs40 pre-made AV's with tactic's the likes of the game has never witnessed b4. Then I read that it was only going to be 10v10, 15v15 &amp; 25v25, not even by your own choice, but roatating on a 3 week loop! Now they've gone and removed the biggest bracket of the 3 available! <br />
<br />
I come from a small pvp guild myself, but the plan was to join forces with other small pvp guilds every time you needed to make up the numbers. For me bg's should be about large scale battles, not tiny little ones. I don't like this change at all, and like you said Sensa, with the changes already to make 10 &amp; 25 man raids drop the same loot, blizzard will probably use the same excuse in a future expansion to get rid of 25 man raid too. <br />
<br />
Their such hypocrites. People get the choice of 10-25 man raids, yet in pvp people don't want that choice due to logistics? Lame.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Awesome.<br />
<br />
Edit: I thought the removal of 25v25 in the rotation made perfect sense, given it meant a whole week where smaller guilds couldn't take part at all in rated PvP... The tone aside, I do agree that the weekly rotation is odd, and letting people take part in any of the group-sizes at all times would be preferable to this solution, as I'm sure many like you enjoy 25v25... It fits with their 10 man raid philosophy, to let people pick whatever size they prefer/have the people for... as long as matches could be made quick enough, of course. With the combined server-pools for BGs, I don't see it being an issue!<br />
<br />
I am assuming there are reasons why the rotation system was chosen, rather than 'pick which you want', which we both think would be better... It's easy to assume no thought has occurred simply because someone's conclusion was different to your thoughtful one, :)<br />
<br />
In a rotation system, I agree with Blizzard that 25v25's don't work (for reasons completely unrelated to Guild EXP) and would be dull for people unable to get the people together - forcing them to make larger groups than they wanted to play with/could do so easily. (The same problem with 25 man raids giving better gear). If the rotation system is scrapped, and players can join any battleground size, problem solved, :)</div></div><hr />

I don't know if Blizzard has plans to change it to the way you mentioned, but currently you can place all 8 raid target icons parallely to the 5 raid markers making in sum 13 visible icons at once.<br />
As I said, it is confusing due to the recycling of the icons, but can be advantageous for positioning (I assume most of the raids rarely use all 8 raid target icons.)</div></div><hr />

You need to be in a raid and either be the raid leader or a raid assistant.<br />
<br />
On the left side of the screen you'll notice a bar, which you can expand; the new Mini raid manager, where you can issue ready checks, role checks and also assign the raid target icons etc.. At the lower right corner you should see something along the line &quot;World markers&quot;. Click that and you can select the color of the marker you want to set.<br />
Currently it will be a smoke flare.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and seriously, with all the aoe spells now, both boss effects and player effects, does anyone think adding more colors on top of more colors is actually a good thing?<br />
<br />
Because that addon that blizz banned was actively and dynamically telling players where to go by itself with no input from the player. These markers are different, as in they're player set.</div></div><hr />

as of the markers they are the flare markers you still have your normal target markers...<br />

<div class="post"><div class="posttop"><div class="username">cerbul</div><div class="date">2010-11-12, 01:49 PM</div></div><div class="posttext">On the 25v25 raged bgs removal:<br />
<br />
We can talk about a great experience when all the 25 ppl of a rated bg are in the same ts/ventrilo/whatever so that they can coordonate themselves, or be coordinated by a leader.<br />
If a verry small portion of the pvp oriented are able to really organize 25 ppl rated bgs talking over ts/vent then this means that a huge part of the player base will skip the week when the 25 ppl one up. Why do you think I hate bgs? For the simple fact that I can't make a premade and control every player in there. And to control the situation you need them all on your ts.. kind of hard with pugs, isn't it?<br />
<br />
On the new marks:<br />
First of all, AVR wasn't removed for the fact that you were able to show the ppl the exact position where they should move, nor for the fact that it provided a more visible target. The most important reason that led to it's removal was the fact that putting circles on all the players in a raid was trivializing positioning on boss abilities like malleable goo. When I tested AVR I was able to see a circle around every single player in the raid, and easily pick a position where was no circle. That was trivializing those abilities.<br />
<br />
On the part of having finaly visible marks, I can only say that was a really lame game design to relay an encounter on the inability of players to see the marks in time. See Blood Queen Lanathel encounter, if you don't find the player that you need to bite in time, you automatically fail. How exactly you manage to see that player? First of all you need to select it. Use raid frames for that, otherwise you will end up clicking forever around. After you target it, you need to find where is standing. How exaclty is that possible? Don't tell me all the players in this world have such great eyes to see the hit box of the friendly selected unit? That is pure RNG. So in other words, my appreciation for Blizzard for 2 things:<br />
1. No more lame encounters based on the fact that is hard to see where a player is.<br />
2. The best thing AVR gave us, Blizzard just gave it back to us: helping raid leaders to explain in a more easy manner where ppl have to move.<br />
I have to agree that some new marks, other than the ones existing, specifically for positioning wouldn't hurt.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if they do restrict the markings to remain on a specific place, and not to be linked to players, or if they simply allow only the static/on the floor marks to be used by addons like dbm/bigwigs/dxe then we have a problem: I see hell unleashed :p</div></div><hr />

Doubtful. The person who hit gamon crit him for 18 dmg (crit), and he has 46k health (meaning he is not low level). Gamon apparently hits very hard and has damage mitigation that is unattainable by a player (I'd say 90%+ damage reduction).</div></div><hr />

So now, instead of just killing him with one click/button action, we can get our friends involved and get in the fun too.

And you all know by the end of Cataclysm tanks with self-heals will definitely be able to solo him; we 5 manned him yesterday (with 2 83s).<br />

<br />
and seriously, with all the aoe spells now, both boss effects and player effects, does anyone think adding more colors on top of more colors is actually a good thing?<br />
<br />
Unlike the one addon, raid markers will not automatically tell everyone where to stand as the fight goes on. The markers are useful in that the are controlled by the players. It's still up to the party/raid leader to inform everyone what to do. And, it's up to the rest of the party and raid to listen and understand properly. It helps explain positioning before the fight without aggroing the boss. &quot;Go stand by the...the...the thingy!!&quot; also isn't terribly descriptive. Some may get it, some may not, but everyone knows what the raid marker looks like.<br />
<br />
Also, I imagine it would be quite hard to draw rude images on the 3D world using the new markers.<br />
<br />

<br />
Does this now mean that these raid markers can no longer be positioned directly over specific players and follow them? Or are they functional in that sense also, plus the glow?<br />
<br />
These are simply for positioning. The markers one places on players and mobs are staying the same.<br />

Why did they even bother to break AVR?<br />
I mean, ok, some stuff is missing - but this was the most important mark. So? lol<br />
<br />
AVR was automatic. This is not. The new raid marker system is what raids have been doing for years, anyway, but with engineers and smoke flares. Mind you, this would be before the fight actually started. During the fight, one may not have time to update the positional markers.<br />
<br />
One example of many: if there's stuff on the ground that's causing damage, I'd think it's expected that one would move out of the way, rather than wait for a raid leader to place a new marker. By that time, you could be dead already. <br />
<br />
I suppose one point I'm making is that the new markers still require one to be aware of what's going on and be ready to think on one's feet. It's more to say, &quot;I'll tank the boss over here&quot;, and &quot;DPS should stand over here&quot;, and possibly where the tank, melee and ranged DPS should move to in different phases.</div></div><hr />

AVR gave very accurate circles to each action, these seem to have a set radius and I'm not sure (I don't know mod coding at all) if DBM could incorporate it into encounters that would benefit from these markers.

<br />
We can talk about a great experience when all the 25 ppl of a rated bg are in the same ts/ventrilo/whatever so that they can coordonate themselves, or be coordinated by a leader.<br />
If a verry small portion of the pvp oriented are able to really organize 25 ppl rated bgs talking over ts/vent then this means that a huge part of the player base will skip the week when the 25 ppl one up. Why do you think I hate bgs? For the simple fact that I can't make a premade and control every player in there. And to control the situation you need them all on your ts.. kind of hard with pugs, isn't it?<br />
<br />
On the new marks:<br />
First of all, AVR wasn't removed for the fact that you were able to show the ppl the exact position where they should move, nor for the fact that it provided a more visible target. The most important reason that led to it's removal was the fact that putting circles on all the players in a raid was trivializing positioning on boss abilities like malleable goo. When I tested AVR I was able to see a circle around every single player in the raid, and easily pick a position where was no circle. That was trivializing those abilities.<br />
<br />
On the part of having finaly visible marks, I can only say that was a really lame game design to relay an encounter on the inability of players to see the marks in time. See Blood Queen Lanathel encounter, if you don't find the player that you need to bite in time, you automatically fail. How exactly you manage to see that player? First of all you need to select it. Use raid frames for that, otherwise you will end up clicking forever around. After you target it, you need to find where is standing. How exaclty is that possible? Don't tell me all the players in this world have such great eyes to see the hit box of the friendly selected unit? That is pure RNG. So in other words, my appreciation for Blizzard for 2 things:<br />
1. No more lame encounters based on the fact that is hard to see where a player is.<br />
2. The best thing AVR gave us, Blizzard just gave it back to us: helping raid leaders to explain in a more easy manner where ppl have to move.<br />
I have to agree that some new marks, other than the ones existing, specifically for positioning wouldn't hurt.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if they do restrict the markings to remain on a specific place, and not to be linked to players, or if they simply allow only the static/on the floor marks to be used by addons like dbm/bigwigs/dxe then we have a problem: I see hell unleashed :p<br />
<br />
Hi, let's make an agreement. I won't talk about AVR if you stfu about pvp. Deal? I hope so because you know nothing about it. <br />
<br />
Oh QQ I couldn't get together a 25 man team, so everyone should be punished. This is just more of blizzs caving to people who don't like pvp. Isn't it enough that people have already dropped it, mlg is picking it up but word is they won't after next season. Plus the latest incident with col red. I wish they would just go ahead and say &quot;hey we don't give a crap about pvp, you were stupid to think we did, hahaha no go fck off&quot;. They lied about the queue for wintergrasp, along with a ton of other stuff they lied about. <br />
<br />
Everyone has been telling them the rotation is the problem. Do they listen? No, instead they say &quot;hey we want you guys to be able to choose how to play&quot; then they turn around and say &quot;naa, we actually don't but lolz@u for believing us&quot;. <br />
<br />
I posted this in another forum, but I swear it's just silly how things are right now. I come online and see that fans for The Old Republic didn't like the name for one of the class specializations. So what did bioware do? They are renaming it, and letting the fans vote on the new name. I know that one account doesn't mean anything to blizz, they have been driving that home. The rampant deletion of threads, or out right bans on their forums for anyone who disagrees with them. Making fun of players at conventions. It's just too much. The last thing this game had going for it in my opinion was the pvp aspect. They have already messed it up so bad by making this the casterclysm. What did they do in response to that? They went and buffed one melee class through the roof, and neutered the rest for pvp &quot;balance&quot;. How the hell is not even being able to compete balance? <br />
<br />
Sure it's a nerd rage, but it's something that should be said. The people happy over them removing the 25v25 bracket are not real fans of pvp. They are pve people who like to occasionally pvp. The real pvpers that were from small guilds had already agreed to join into bigger groups to do 25v25. <br />
<br />
Hey blizz, wake the hell up and admit you made a mistake with this rotation. Then switch it so we can choose 10,15,25 brackets. I can't wait to hear all the pve people QQ when they finally do remove 25 man raids. That is what this is comparable to.<br />
<br />
<br />
<br />
Why are people complaining about the bloated and packed 25v25 bracket?<br />
<br />
1st - Less than 0.01% of players would participate in 25v25. Its a size that no one cares to coordinate or play in.<br />

<br />
Wow, way to make up numbers. Let's see<br />
1. 25% of pvpers are interested. See I can do it too<br />
2. Umm, how is it any different than a 25 man raid. Infact it is easier, because pvpers for the most part aren't nearly as stupid as pvers. We take the time to learn our class, what we need to do etc. It would be easier to get 25 people together for pvp, much easier than say a raid. <br />
3. Again you are wrong. Right now there are 25 man bgs that you can queue up for pretty fast. It isn't instant, but it isn't that long either. Plus when more battle groups are together it won't take nearly as long. <br />
4. You are just an idiot. There are plenty of people that were eagerly looking forward to the 25v25 bracket. Just because you werent, or YOU couldn't find 25 people that thought you were more than a scrub doesn't mean the rest of us are. Hell walk outside of org and you can find more than 25 people dueling just waiting for the chance to do a bg. Guild points aside it's easy to get a 25 man group together. <br />
<br />
If they are just worried about guild points for advancement, make it so you get no guild xp unless you win. Then if you do happen to have a guild group for 25v25 and you are good. You win and get rewarded. What is wrong with that?</div></div><hr />

How often in pve do you have to keep up with when a boss has used several different abilities, in addition to any gear he has on. I shouldn't have put nearly as stupid, but pvpers have to be much more aware than pve players. PvE players have one boss to keep track of, while pvp players have at least 2 people to keep track of, sometimes much more than 2. There is also the fact that pvp opponents are not as predictable as pve bosses. They will not use the same abilities in the same order. They will not spam something on cool down usually. If they are good they are going to change tactics on the fly. So the two in my opinion are not even comparable when you get to the complexity of it.</div></div><hr />

3. Again you are wrong. Right now there are 25 man bgs that you can queue up for pretty fast. It isn't instant, but it isn't that long either. Plus when more battle groups are together it won't take nearly as long.<br />
4. You are just an idiot. There are plenty of people that were eagerly looking forward to the 25v25 bracket. Just because you werent, or YOU couldn't find 25 people that thought you were more than a scrub doesn't mean the rest of us are. Hell walk outside of org and you can find more than 25 people dueling just waiting for the chance to do a bg. Guild points aside it's easy to get a 25 man group together.<br />
<br />
If they are just worried about guild points for advancement, make it so you get no guild xp unless you win. Then if you do happen to have a guild group for 25v25 and you are good. You win and get rewarded. What is wrong with that? <br />
<br />
1) 25% of pvpers aren't interested. Hate to tell you that, but my imaginary number is far far closer than your imaginary number. <br />
<br />
2) &quot;Getting together 25 people for pvp&quot; is something that sounds good in theory but simply doesn't work in practice. Getting together 25 people for a raid that will go on for 4 hours requires a massive amount of organization. Getting 25 people focusing on the same objective in pvp while having to wait for queues is an awful idea.<br />
<br />
3) Oh, this one is rich. You obviously have no comprehension of how the PVP queuing system works, so why are you shooting your mouth as if you do? Have you ever queued for a 10man raid group in pvp? How long does that take for you? Usually the queues are at LEAST half an hour long. Imagine 25 players trying to find a group versus 25 other players. The limitations are just too great for 25 people. 10 and 15 will be fine, 25 was simply too many.<br />
<br />
4) Calling me an idiot and a scrub just outlines the fact that everything you said was, again: Incorrect. &quot;Plenty of people&quot; obviously weren't plenty of people, because they cancelled the bracket, and everyone except a very few small voices like your own (And you're not helping your cause by raging out in your small, whiny internet voice shouting &quot;LOLZ SCRUB U CANT FIND 25MAN&quot;) agree with the reasons it was removed.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I love large scale PVP. I'll be enjoying 10v10 and 15v15 brackets with guildmates. Thankfully, there won't be any embarassing 25v25. You'll play in both brackets if you have any pvp mentality too, so stop crying and acting as if 25v25 was going to be the next big thing, when all it was going to be was a giant, bloated, ineffective system no one but 0.01% of players cared about. Thats why it was dropped.</div></div><hr />

The new raid markers look terrible; like a whack-a-mole made a baby with the lucky charms leprechaun.</div></div><hr />

<br />
and seriously, with all the aoe spells now, both boss effects and player effects, does anyone think adding more colors on top of more colors is actually a good thing?<br />
<br />
This.<br />
<br />
That's why WoW is hemoraging players. Once a good MMO comes out we can stop the bleeding.</div></div><hr />

<br />
You'll probably be surprized to hear from me that I actualy would love to do more pvp, but not in a pug. I would love to be able to premade a 40 ppl bg one day with all the players on the same ts/ventrilo.<br />
I am an arena player, I do enjoy pvp, but doing bgs in a pug can be a nightmare. So please don't put together bgs with arenas.<br />
I also do agree that the rotation is the problem, and that we should be able to chose between and/or have better rewards from higher brackets to have an interest to play the higher ones.<br />
I also do agree that Blizzard came with the wrong solution to a rotation problem, i.e. to remove 25v25 rated bgs.<br />
I think you also do agree that having a bg with all the players on the same ts/ventrilo is something would be alot more fun then dealing with players that do not listen/don't know/or cannot be told what to do since they are not on the same ts/ventrilo. Or even if you like bgs in a pug, I am sure that alot more players would like to play bgs if they could bring their friends only to any bg size.</div></div><hr />
