Welcome on MMO-Champion ! 
 
Site is finally open and we will add more contents very soon, essentially raid strategies which are still missing (but hey ... these things take a tremendous amount of time) and also a few more things, but you should already find a bunch of useful informations.  
 
If you notice an error or a bug on the website post on the forums. You can also post if you would like to see something added to" />

Bugs<br />
- A few items tooltips still don't work, but clicking them should still give you proper informations about them.</div></div><hr />

As a request regarding the Raid Strategies, can there be a raid strategies forum, per say, where (and no troll is allowed) people can offer different strats to various raid encounters (that differs itself from the Raids and Dungeon forums which is made up of 50% troll, 10% necromancy and 40% Post X spec and tell me if good enough dps posts.)<br />
<br />
Like... I have a few different strategies for Loken, and if i post it in raids and dungeons forums, it'll just vanish, whereas this new forum can be attached to the lootlist/wowwiki link and not be overrun by spam of other, irrelated topics (nice to get player feedback on these encounters).<br />
<br />
Anyway great job on the site from 2.5.5 years later!<br />
