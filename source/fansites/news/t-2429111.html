Reddit AMA with 4 Former WoW Developers Wednesday<br />
AMA about Vanilla WoW, with 4 former developers on reddit/classicwow (https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/), Wed Sept 12th at 4 PM EDT<br />
<br />
John Staats, the author of The WoW Diary (thewowdiary.com), will be joined by former teammates for an AMA. Former devs include lead gameplay programmer Sam Lantinga, exterior level designer Bo Bell, and game designer Alexander Brazie. They will appear on r/classicwow Wednesday, September 12th at 4 PM EDT. We will be fielding questions from people interested in the nuts-and-bolts of how MMOs are built, demystifying the process of game development.<br />
<br />
Bo Bell (Hapy00) created zones such as Loch Modan, Duskwood, Moonglade, Thousand Needles, Silverpine Forest, and Durotar. He helped on other zones with other exterior level designers (they all did). He worked in QA for almost two years before moving onto WoW, testing Diablo, Starcraft, and Diablo II.<br />
<br />
Alexander Brazie (Xelnath) was a monster, dungeon, and raid designer who joined the company soon after the game launched. He worked on event design, monster design, spawning, boss fight design, pet battles, and overhauling warlock spells.<br />
<br />
Sam Lantinga (slouken) was a lead gameplay engineer on WoW. In addition to creating the WoW UI addon system, he worked on spells, AI, and gameplay systems like phasing and battlegrounds.<br />
<br />
John Staats (whenitsready) built half of Vanilla WoW's instanced dungeons, and 90% of its non-instanced dungeons (caves, mines, crypts, etc.), including Booty Bay, Warsong Gulch, and Loch Modan Dam.<br />

How is it possible to get almost everything wrong on the first try? And why do they feel this need to time-gate everything this time around.. It feels worse than ever with the end-game in BfA. Everything is just limited in terms of time invested compared to the rewards you get from doing it. It becomes so dull and boring really, really fast.<br />
<br />
<br />
Who actually enjoys doing these World Quests over and over again? They are nothing special, and the most &quot;important&quot; ones are the ones giving Champions of Azeroth and Tortollan reputation and they are the most repetitive and the dullest of them all... After doing them XX-amount of times it's just no fun or engaging anymore. But we feel somewhat forced to do it as the game wants you to keep pushing for those emissaries, keeps on pushing you to get additional azerite power etc but it does not feel rewarding.<br />
<br />
What do Blizzard do? They start limiting add-ons so you can't do these World Quests as efficient as you were used to. Sure having add-ons auto-grouping you is affecting how long time you spend on these world quests, but why limit us in the first place? I've done the quests multiple times already. It's no longer new to me, it's no longer interesting or engaging. It's just something I'm forced to do in order to complete emissaries and progress my reputations and azerite power... Don't make it even longer and duller than it has to be.<br />
<br />
Same goes with ground-mount only. I do agree having ground-mount only in the beginning is a good choice as the content is best experienced from that point of view. But when you have completed all zones, completed all questlines, and have done every single world quests a bunch of times already why not grant access to flying mounts so I don't have to waste all this time travelling between the one dull world quest to the next? You are just making the dull and boring content even more tedious for no apparent reason other than Blizzard wanting to limit player progression.<br />
<br />
Island Expeditions is a complete failure. It doesn't offer anything new or meaningful to the game. It's a simple randomized dungeon without any unique content or boss encounters. There is no point to them in terms of story or gameplay. The only reason I do them is in order to get the +2500 azerite power bonus for doing 4x per week. Azerite Power which is a horrible mechanic that I have to keep farming in order to get my Heart of Azeroth necklace higher level and in order to get higher level azerite gear useful as without a high heart of azeroth level you are simply better of with lower level azerite gear with all traits unlocked instead of higher level azerite gear with their traits locked.<br />
<br />
Warfronts had potential, but it ended up just being a 20-man scenario that takes you 15-25 minutes to complete. It's completely static, with no sense of stake or challenge to it and it plays out the exact same each and every time no matter the effort you are putting into it. By adding the item level requirement you are basically buttering the entire prospect of Warfronts as it gives no sensible reward for active players to do them as besides the initial ilevel 370 reward you don't get anything meaningful out of them and when the content is this static who will keep on playing the Warfronts besides alts for gearing?<br />
<br />
<br />
This expansion is just not delivering. It feels like Ion and Blizzard is more focused on time-gating the content like it's some sort of free-to-play mobile game instead of actually making sure the content that is being delivered is entertaining, fun and engaging to play. It seems more important to make sure that content and player progression is kept at a phase that makes sure you feel somewhat forced to login on a regular basis in order to progress, at the same time as dedicated a bunch of time in the game must not let you progress too fast or too far so you still feel you have to keep logging in all the time each and every day, each and every week. But instead the focus should really be on making sure that whats added to the game is top quality and engaging for the players.</div></div><hr />

But because of fairness, it would be important to apply that adjustment AFTER the current run for the horde, so both factions could profit from it in the first run. After that - no problem.<br />
<br />
I mean, honestly, it was a joke that you could fully eqiup with warfronts in 2 days. I'm all 340 (or more) now aside from trinkets and tank/dps weapon.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Agreed. It would be nice if they gave a tank trinket that worked like monk stagger. 10% of all damage is instead absorbed and redirected as a dot over 8 seconds. If you fall below 40% this effect increases to 80% for 5 seconds. This effect can only occur once every 4 minutes.</div></div><hr />

You'll anger the no-flyers! You didn't mention war mode but this is the place to do it (because war-mode hates flying unless they have a dismount boot with ultra-range). War Mode would've worked so much better if WE HADN'T BEEN SENT TO DIFFERENT ISLANDS FOR A MASSIVE AMOUNT OF THE BFA CONTENT. Caps 100% required. This was a clear case of different teams not talking to each other.<br />

<br />
Agreed. I did them in beta and saw right away how dull/reptitive they would be. Now take most rewards out and....<br />
<br />
<br />

Yeah it's a big THONK. Why did they make this change now and not far earlier, or later in the xpac when they up the reward ilvl etc?<br />

<br />
Time will tell if the money/internet outrage plays through to send that message, though. Especially regarding money. If they got enough from BFA, the suits won't care.<br />
<br />
<br />
Either way, the era of &quot;launches when it's ready&quot; for Blizz is long, long, long, LONG gone.</div></div><hr />

I'll bet I'm not the only one. People forget that forum posters, here and everywhere else, are just a small minority of the whole player base. For every one doomsayer, there are probably a thousand people that have the opposite opinion. I know people here like to think that those of us that frequent official and non-official forums represent the entire player base, but that just isn't even anywhere near what the reality is. <br />

You aren't the only one, but the; &quot;fansites and platforms tend to be negative, so their feedback is wrong,&quot; mentality isn't helpful or accurate in the slightest.</div></div><hr />

Try one of the more annoying dungeons on high mythic/stupid. Motherlode with stupid affixes and above +7 is horrid, some of the goblins in there hit harder than raid bosses with spells.</div></div><hr />

320 is too high when heroic dungeons give 325 and Warfront gives free and easy 340? uh huh</div></div><hr />

I'm not saying they're wrong. I'm saying they're in the minority.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Weird you say that because I didn't say anything about shutting servers down. I did say we should fire people who have demonstrated they are incompetent or incapable at doing their job.</div></div><hr />
