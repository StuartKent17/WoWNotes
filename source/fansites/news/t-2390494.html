Increased incentive to try and lure people who don't want to do it into Warmode for the sake of rewards. Which will drain the population from PvE shards, meaning less people to group up with and see in the world.</div></div><hr />

<br />
How's it any different to PvP achievements, do PvE players also feel &quot;forced&quot; to do those?<br />
<br />
Also in WoD there was the PvP building that earned you achievements, toys and titles... people weren't complaining about that, so what makes this any different? God forbid there being some incentives! There are PvP mounts but I don't feel &quot;forced&quot; in getting them...</div></div><hr />

Think about that city that is 30 mins away from you. No, not that one you've already been to - but that one you haven't. Yeah, there we go. You knew it was there. Why haven't you gone there yet? lolwhat?<br />

Agreed. Been annoyed for years that they keep moving the &quot;Maelstrom&quot; around. It's suppose to be in the CENTER, and each expansion with additional land masses, keeps pushing it around.</div></div><hr />

Lore wise, the land masses are there already we just have no reason to go to them. What I find irksome is Kul'Tiras is so close but those dickheads didn't help out. This is why Alliance don't deserve nice things.</div></div><hr />

<br />
I dont hate that the world map is changing thats how maps work. Check out nautical maps of the world in the 1500s and compare them to the 1700s. I hate the fact that objects are so close to each other on the maps they need to stretch the map out Fkn broken isles is right next to kul tiras and all that shit implying we have never been or seen that shit in recent memory.</div></div><hr />

It may just be something they put in for some fun variety like the vicious war-bears while they aren't really attached to a race, but it would be fascinating if it turned out to be the racial mount of a race we won't meet until farther into the expac.</div></div><hr />

<br />
Also, the same thing was with Broken Shore, we traveled across it to northrend for years.<br />
The islands have always existed lore wise, so we clearly did not have a reason to go there, as of not being visible on the map :P<br />
People need to get some fantasy thinking... :&gt;</div></div><hr />

Lolwut? Overpowered?<br />
Yes, it's a PvP mount, I understand that, but the PvP mounts are the same species as race mounts, hence my question :). It would be kind of fun and inappropriate to have a hippo mount as raciaal mount for fat humans, so I hope they are :D</div></div><hr />

No. Rexxar is from Warcraft III and only peons are hunched over. We are used to straight back heroes from WC III.</div></div><hr />

You're getting way too weird on the warcraft 3 stuff. Ofc rexxar originated from warcraft 3, but even then he seemed a bit more hunched because of his large pelt on the back and camera angle accencuated that. Anyway, blizzard knows best what they want for the character but I'd be curious to see what he would look like using hunched posture.</div></div><hr />

Rexxar actually looks like a half orc here, gj Blizzard<br />

Probably because he is.</div></div><hr />

Since it is unique from Orc models it could be a sign of a Half-Orge Allied race in the future which would fit better than plain ogres.<br />

Probably. GMs solve a lot of disputes by looking at chat logs, but whenever someone uses voice chat they have no way of checking who is right, which makes voice chat good tool for scamming. Recording chat should help with that.</div></div><hr />

Well I guess it depends on what it will be...I mean the mount one is a rather wasted one for dungeons/raids. So will take a nice one to win me over I think.</div></div><hr />
